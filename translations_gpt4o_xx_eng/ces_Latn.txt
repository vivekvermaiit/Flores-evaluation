USA Gymnastics supports the letter to the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic Committee that the interests of our athletes, their teams, and the sports themselves will be better protected if we support meaningful changes within our organization, rather than if the organization loses its official powers.

This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as information about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotene-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the issue of feather development in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, which is called rachis, but have other features - barbs and hooks - researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Scientists assume that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than those of a juvenile.
Scientists assume that although it is a tail of a young dinosaur, the sample represents the feathering of an adult animal and not the down feathers of a juvenile.
A bomb in a vehicle that exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is apparently determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Based on the luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of a star is determined, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic turnover.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written with the aim of simulating the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was searching for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts force on the Earth and causes the tides of the sea, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a sort of "halo" and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant is "highly concerning, even alarming, due to its high malignancy."
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
In the span of one year, an infected person can spread the infection to 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 people out of the total number of 330,000 infected at a certain point in South Africa.

Infrared photos show how the temperature differences between day and night indicate that these are likely caves.
"During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface and, conversely, warmer at night."
"Their thermal changes are not as stable as in the case of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technologies: voters isolate themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper into an envelope, in which they indicate the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a rather strict codification of the election process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there were no envelopes inside before voting began and that no other envelopes were added apart from those deposited by counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives who then witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four female skiers in the women's sitting skiing group did not finish their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Police Director D. K. Arya said, "We have detained five individuals who raped a woman from Switzerland, and we have secured a mobile phone and a laptop belonging to the victim from the detainees."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Director Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services were extricating the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She is awaiting charges and a trial in custody, but the evidence of witnesses may be compromised because her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts perceived the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be skating on thin ice if they publish photos and other items of suspects."
The prosecution, which is responsible for the criminal proceedings, made it clear to the journalists that no further information will be provided at least until the indictment is issued.
According to the leak, the document will concern border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain the boundaries as they were before the Middle East war in 1967.
Other included topics are said to involve the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence only for five years.
During the study of supplementary pest protection, the shooters were under strict supervision by the rangers, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration between NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Association of Sporting Shooters), qualified volunteers were hired under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director in the area of natural heritage conservation at the NPWS agency, the four shooters selected for the inaugural shooting received comprehensive safety training and drills.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO as part of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission represented Martelly's response to massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize elections and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the delay of the report by Apple "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck in Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands archipelago stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six dead have been confirmed at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were soon released, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the older lady because she needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in the field of medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 he began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While Liggins worked in the hospital, he began to study premature births in his free time.
His research showed that if hormones are administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" with records of the flight's progress on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away during the night when there were two Moons in the sky. Unique, just like herself. She was a strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels stated, “Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe even more... I liked her and I will miss her... hopefully she's somewhere better.”
A public opinion survey conducted among 1,400 people before the federal elections in 2010 showed that the number of people who disagree with transforming Australia into a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for the extreme views within the survey, 29 percent of respondents are convinced that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his objections, there were doubts about his eligibility.
He couldn't take the medication needed to overcome the pain because drugs are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number so far on January 25.
The discovery was verified using various hardware and software by several people at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of delivering water to the Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets were formed, especially how Earth came into being since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He described these rumors as "political gossip and indiscretion."
There is speculation that he will attempt a presidential candidacy in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA agency, would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
No special transportation will be introduced, overground train service will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park-and-ride spaces available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation options have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that new species have evolved in just two generations, even though it was assumed that this process takes much longer, due to the interbreeding between endemic finches, Darwin's medium ground finches, and immigrant cactus and large ground finches.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be hammered or pressed into sheets.
It can be processed to considerable thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is called the pH value of a chemical. You can create an indicator yourself using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then use clean, wet hands to form a ball out of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were visited by both men and women together.
If you are calling someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite for the call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects its signal almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and field of view for us.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a large rocket is needed, measuring over 100 feet.
The bicycle changed the world in an unprecedented way. The most significant thing it caused was the substantial facilitation and acceleration of transport.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized feline predators, whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats), whose main diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the system of ecological niches, meaning that each cat has its own tasks that prevent it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related and form a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
A lion pride behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If given the chance, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, recognizing by smell the paths they have taken on the ground.
At night, they can see very well thanks to their night vision and can move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or ways of adaptation to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce their nutrition from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is of plant origin. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had no concerns except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set embedded in the upper palate, meaning that nothing crossing its path had a chance to escape.
We don't know for sure, but they might have had a forked tongue. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they might have even been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their dishes would not be unfamiliar to us, the Romans had their share of peculiar or unusual banquet compositions, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their food sitting on chairs, while wealthy men liked to hold feasts together and lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that only reached Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a peculiar sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place under the open sky.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no extensive forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. The Norse sagas write that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it the Green Land.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were part of "Scandinavia," there were many differences among the inhabitants, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known for certain, it is evident that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was simply added as an attachment.
The landing in Normandy and the subsequent battles brought about the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country had not yet been liberated.
He was ruled by the French "Vichy". These were the French who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and, instead of fighting, collaborated with the invading forces.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a certain culture common to a significant large group of people who live and work in mutual cooperation, i.e., together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil" and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," as well as "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also in a way defines the size of society.
Precursors to nations were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces, and adequate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, falling under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities to enforce laws, which often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to abolish tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states and only then could they be amended. The states took the central government lightly, to the extent that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in northern areas, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic contests.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, and the largest of them is Honshu, making Japan actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Considering the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes referred to in a geographical sense as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by noted the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a transformation of the indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By the year 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the most frequent film size at the height of the analog film era.
They are still being produced today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has also been adopted by the sensor formats of digital cameras.
Although it is somewhat confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is thus 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
The often misused and ridiculed "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in an image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had gained wealth and power, became the subject of detailed scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion connected European states despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous strength had an impact on everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective because it disrupted vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain patrolled international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic was met with only a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare forces.
During the 1920s, attitudes of pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses to the horror and cruelty during World War I, the nations longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his superior from a previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing between different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a relentless war took place among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
After the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army, as instead of military ranks based on class affiliation, what matters now is abilities.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to attempt to start a revolution in their own countries.
Mohamed had a deep interest in matters beyond the realm of worldly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
With its location at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not at all easy to find her, even if it were known that she exists. Inside the cave, she is in complete isolation.
There's nothing to see but a wonderfully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures constructed in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in Egypt's Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like the letter V, and the "down-bow" mark looks like a staple or a square missing the bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and press the bow, down means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
An upward movement generally produces a gentler sound, while a downward movement is stronger and more piercing.
You can write your own marks in the sheet with a pencil, but keep in mind that the printed marks have their own musical purpose, so they should usually be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister Elizabeth Philipp of France were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, which was surrounded by a tumultuous crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one moment in Versailles, a member of the criminal group shook the head of a royal guard in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large portion of the expenses, while the interest from the bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through banking houses on Wall Street.
Extra surpluses derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, constitute the basic revenue of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, according to most opinions, ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that greatly exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "influence" on societies that is inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor vehicles appear, it will inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accident cases, which results in the invention of new medical techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographically shaped individuals and over time led to the emergence of customs and culture related to this geography, and these, because they were consistent with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its significance decreased during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that participants of the Crusades brought back to Europe valuables such as silk and spices, which were more valuable at home than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the dresses were significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
Due to slow communication, however, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of this period was that as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to produce only the amount of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using seeds native to the given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, which still occurs in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw from several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, unfortunate accidents, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children have been imprisoned for a long time (usually imprisoned by their own parents), in some cases they lived in isolation because their parents rejected them due to their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma, after which they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed that some were raised by animals, while it is said about others that they lived in the wild alone.
When fully raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits almost identical behavior (within physical capabilities) to that of the caring animal, such as its fear or disregard for humans.
While project-based learning aims to facilitate learning and make it more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
A scaffold is not a teaching method, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are acquiring new skills, such as using a new computer program or launching a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is a small clip in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual constructions designed to analyze, motivate, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the student alone.
Children are placed into foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they do not receive proper nutrition, care, and upbringing, yet such cases do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care aims to meet all the needs that were not fulfilled in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet add another dimension when it comes to usage and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivational elements for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continued interest” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they explored audience responses to web pages.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, you can find out whether the other person is lying to you.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks suggested how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nonetheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the differences between the two sets in both directions within each generation.
For primates with a digestive system similar to humans, it is difficult to satisfy the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savanna.
If they do not do so, there are serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are hard for us as primates to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors dealt with the protein problem in a way similar to how chimpanzees do it today on the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking from normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm that brings you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces a person to get up and go to the bathroom.
The measure of a person's inner peace corresponds to the opposite of the measure of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good life force brings. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is attainable by everyone. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are essentially very simple. They are kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the poses of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The focal point of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energetic channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. Clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries at the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years and was indeed fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope lay in retreat and regrouping forces along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans almost fell apart overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after troops invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the naval fleet was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but at the same time, the navy was also tasked with preventing the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, similar to the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often guarded by shepherds, often children or adolescents similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
Horse-drawn railways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although stagecoach roads mostly consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve greater speeds and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually discovered that tracks are more efficient when they have a strip of iron on their surface.
It became a common phenomenon, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor Australopithecus generally did not walk upright.
Bipedal creatures appear in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
In order to somewhat reduce future suffering, we can live more environmentally friendly, join the environmental protection movement, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is evident that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have increased as a result of overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap prints," were produced overnight.
For the first time, the document was publicly read by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One of the copies reached London on August 10.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called Dunlap broadsides, namely a total of 25 prints from Dunlap's press. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many features in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or in computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions in case of that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in the formal sense.
This term is derived from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are cunning, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are known, making it a leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples may choose to plan the adoption of their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is, in fact, a guide for most scientific research.
However, it is not experimentation in itself. An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and making observations are also important for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were adopted.
As the knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue in a free-running cycle even without the presence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the germ line cells were affected.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave small towns, drive to work, and meanwhile they pass others who are heading to the place they just left.
Everyone participates in this dynamic shuttle service and supports a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state, which supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in life in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely encounter a similar level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems provoke so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something deeper?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
For the purpose of better representing traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily evade predators and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back along their body.
It provides them with a greater selection of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because it doesn't seem to a person that the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and the second longest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places it is up to six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed either in size or in the technical precision of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City includes around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are of the Roman Catholic faith.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily mined using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are plenty of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and secondary uses with the emergence of new writing methods.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they do not come into contact with a pencil sharpener at all.
One can only marvel at what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission nuclear bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's something like pulling a heavy cart uphill. When the atomic nucleus is split again, part of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to decay with minimal or even no contact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and around 100 km on the far side.
Below the seas it is weaker and beneath the mountain ranges it is stronger again.
On the near side, there may be more lunar maria because the crust is thinner. This allowed lava to reach the surface more easily.
Content theories are focused on identifying what can engage people or what is close to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they adopt as their own during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do, and what in their environment prompts them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues – peers. At one end of the spectrum, there is an effort to remain "one of them" (or one of the group).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person changes beyond recognition and feels that they must change everything the team does and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often serve as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams might meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson – LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The 'invisible team' is a management team to whom every member is subordinate. The invisible team sets the standards for individual members."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the organization's functional components, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
The result is that the process of a collaborative organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, its leadership must create an innovative corporate culture, implement knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organizations use to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition, thereby narrowing and specifying this area of research.
The scientists in their research are supported by the interconnection between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and previously unseen processes.
It provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has strong connotations with science fiction, it constitutes a very important area of computer science concerned with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent action.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and is embedded in a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
The technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions. Students can look at artifacts from the museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
Students from Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, create a website every year about their trip to the state capital. Each year they redesign the pages, but the old versions remain online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Even though their blogging is often initially marked by poor spelling, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to stay informed about the world around them." The need to spark audience interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and inspires students to extend their education beyond the boundaries of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "will allow students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their attitudes in the context of other texts and formulate their perspective on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the beauties of the Muskoka region and more are yet to be discovered.
All of this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered by foreigners to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised by the following statistic about the population: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of wildlife, we can consider it a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are affiliated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries. It thrived in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route (Cape Route) from Europe to India.
In the north, there is an area bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers present themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful that it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that due to cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment and that it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be steadfast in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not justify it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the town and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and after the earthquake in 1755, they abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well-considered with regard to the current state of fighting that continues to occur in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest gorilla tracking experiences in Africa.
For getting around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is today an impoverished city, but due to its reputation, it is a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television show "Wonders of the African World," hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it feels more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of the Republic of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is found on the southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Similar to all the National Parks in South Africa, here too it is necessary to pay an entrance fee to the park and a conservation fee.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which allows entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks, can also be beneficial.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider a major travel destination.
A display of buildings that make up the urban skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a shimmering bar graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You get the best views of Hong Kong if you leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of dense urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that was claimed by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stretches of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by bodies of water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian axises in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Given that intercity buses are often full, we recommend buying a ticket several days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but operations did not commence until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani tribe was the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area we now know as eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year as well.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but you might succeed with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance which payment method you can use.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make the exchange before leaving them.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common here.
Winters can be deceptively freezing: temperatures rarely drop below freezing point, but together with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons here: The amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to people, they are still wild animals in the wilderness and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Although they seem peaceful, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured due to not maintaining the proper distance. These animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also keep in mind that bears and other wildlife are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the efforts for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the killing of the high chairman named Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here considering that Auckland lies between two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming options, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are by the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after districts of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which is not a particularly complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Tap water here is safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black is "espresso," cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are indeed expensive, but top-notch.
Throughout the year, many excursions are made onto the cliff, and injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare.
Still, accept advice from authorities, follow the signs, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of Seventeen Seventy. Occasionally, they can be found outside this period as well.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not live actively in the ocean; its primary refuge is the river estuary north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance provides travelers with the certainty that they will have a place to stay at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is usually possible to book other forms of accommodation through them, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think it over or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any modifications or requests should be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel's address.
In the case of some festivals, the substantial majority of attendees decide to camp directly on-site, and most of those involved consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be at the center of the action, you will need to arrive as soon as possible to secure a camping spot close to the music production.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival, the music might continue until late at night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you travel across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as sailing through the ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
St. Petersburg circular cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are not subject to visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos mostly try to ensure that guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it is often difficult to find the way out.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep visitors in good spirits and on the casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, intoxication negatively affects judgment, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at a high altitude or in a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling or blowing snow or by dew or ice on the vehicle's windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists represents the highlight of the entire trip.
The term safari in the well-known sense refers to land travel for the purpose of viewing impressive African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment thus provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can observe them better with binoculars.
A tourist safari consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be organized in various locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it was already the host in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, this situation might be difficult for you.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related event cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if they are not directly in the room.
If an iron is not available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, even burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters have varying efficiency, and if you have concerns, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Difficult insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or in worse cases, allergic reactions, poison spread, or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill a person by force, are generally not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping presents an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and other fees in certain areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxation can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, as it often passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be cautious: steep angles, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The maximum speed limit here is significantly lower than in the preceding and adjoining sections – usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and its strict adherence is even more important.
Interesting, however, is that mobile phone services work far better here than in many sections of the journey, for example, in the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are rich and diverse, very similar to those of their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apples are used in pastries year-round, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds and hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular desserts are often especially suitable to be served with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some hearty sweets, try pastries which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, they typically use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, if used without further specification, this term usually refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available across the archipelago, includes many simply flavored dishes where the taste is dominated by peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups, which hang on both sides of the saddle, serve as support for the rider's feet.
They provide riders with greater stability, but they can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts running, the rider can be dragged along. A number of safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fine sole, which is relatively narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle when a falling rider pulls on it.
Chochamó Valley – a favorite climbing destination of the Chilean prime minister known as the Yosemite of South America, where you can find extensive granite walls and cliffs.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes thanks to the endless potential of the local cliffs.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a common travel activity with many fans sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century as a sport. The first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski tourism: This activity is also referred to as cross-country skiing tourism, skiing tourism, or ski trips.
It relates to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, with the latter of these activities being conducted in steep terrain and requiring much sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can manage to cover slightly longer distances than on foot – but you will rarely move at speeds that you would achieve on skis without a heavy backpack and on a groomed trail.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen Area functions in this regard similarly to a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country individually, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, for example, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handmade items may be classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture related to the trade is also important for many other professions.
Not all Sámi have traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they also made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism represents an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the term "gypsy" is widely used, especially among the non-Romani population, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and the inaccurate perception of the Romani people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You might prefer to look at the advice of other governments rather than your own, but those are primarily intended for their own citizens.
An example could be U.S. citizens, who may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in the given country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it takes various forms that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and fires are forms and consequences of turbulent weather, such as storms, tornadoes, cloudbursts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme meteorological phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to stay informed about any potential adverse weather risks in their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for the term "Hostile Environment Course" will likely find the address of a local company.
The course usually addresses all the problems described here in much greater detail, often in the form of practical exercises as well.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing-based training, thorough first aid instruction, and sometimes weapons handling.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travelers who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies.
Security screenings at checkpoints began to be far more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity remaining intact.
Rip currents are returning waves that break on the beach, often at the site of a cliff, etc.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow concentrates in several deeper sections, and it is precisely here that a fast current into deep water can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue from trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where the current won't drag you away again, or depending on your abilities and whether they've noticed you, it might be better to wait for help.
The shock of returning arrives sooner than cultural shock (there is a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture often have an especially challenging experience readjusting to their native culture.
After returning home from living abroad, you become accustomed to a new culture and have already lost some of the habits from your homeland.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and silence before the show starts.
Usually, you constantly hear tourists and vendors here. The story of sounds and lights resembles a fairy tale book.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and storyteller of a long story.
Various scenes are projected onto the pyramids, with individual pyramids being gradually illuminated.
The South Shetlands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by multiple countries and have the most bases – in 2020, there were 16 active ones.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the mainland. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here into a plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or in the Sentinel Range is located the highest mountain range of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the 4,892-meter high peak of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone because, in order to make a call, you need to be outdoors with no obstructions between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels and expeditions, which need remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular among people who are finishing school. It allows them to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after finishing high school can improve the chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition will usually be charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. "The land of a thousand lakes" also includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, it is not necessarily essential to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boatbuilding is a national pastime in Finland – there is one boat for every seven to eight people here.
Similarly, it is the case in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand; however, elsewhere it is entirely unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, this number is one in forty).
Cruises on the Baltic Sea usually include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia, on the itinerary.
This means that you can visit this historic city for several whole days and return to the boat at night to sleep on it.
If you disembark only as part of cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (in effect since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include German Berlin. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located anywhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the tour.
Traveling by plane can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it is their first flight, or if they have had a traumatic experience in the past.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome the fear of the unknown or the feeling that the situation is out of control.
Parcel delivery companies are well paid for the fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
If they sent the items by air freight, on some routes it could take several days for the items to go through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to handle it faster is to send the item as checked luggage. However, aviation regulations do not allow sending luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly in first or business class is to pull out a thick wad of cash (even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the price of a regular economy ticket for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense to look for discounts on flights from point A to point B for first or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the prices reflect that.
The capital city of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has been plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led in 1994 to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored despite the failure in political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with a population of around 3.7 million, is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port right after Istanbul, and an important transportation hub.
What was once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interwoven with traditional red tile roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, interesting marble statues of doves can be seen over some tombs.
A half-hour walk through this interesting village is worth it.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners due to its beauty described by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb network bus number 403 goes to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, which is a globally known site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial site and also a place that holds an almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived internment at this place are still alive, and there are even more whose loved ones were murdered here or died from exhaustion due to forced labor, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
In this place, please behave with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area with graffiti or by scratching marks into structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the population prefers Catalan, a significant majority understands it, and practically everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs and inscriptions are, however, only in Catalan, because it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is commonly used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned service disruptions are announced by an automated system in many different languages – in Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant people.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to behave as well as possible, that is, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will significantly ease all your interactions.
The outward impression that Parisians are somewhat abrupt quickly dissipates if you show at least basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, especially with beech, spruce, or fir, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimate, varied soil, and different altitudes, significantly different plant communities grow in it.
The area is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
In addition to many more common species, rare fauna such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own shawl, especially a colorful one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this from the supply at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, they only have one size!
Mallorcan cuisine, similar to the cuisine of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredients, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie (you), are always written with a capital letter at the beginning, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, even though writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be careful of the different pronunciation of the sounds r and rr: "caro" means "expensive," while "carro" means "car."
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
If you read these grammar basics, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand individual phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know any of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people who know a bit of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it does not need to be studied separately.
Observatories from the pre-modern era are mostly outdated today and serve as museums or places for education.
Because light pollution at its peak was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms known as hanami has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just a single" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, you will be thrown out without discussion for collecting "specimens."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country to stay in. It's also very easy to navigate there, and you can buy almost everything upon arrival.
However, considering that it is located in the "true tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with the heat (always) and the intense sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Some buses also run north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the intended bus goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an interesting place to go on vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire and Rhine valleys, or a tour of interesting towns on the Danube, or a cruise on the Erie Canal.
They also determine the routes of popular tourist and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most significant holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition where people stay awake on Easter night at some exposed place to watch the sunrise.
Understandably, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may equally well be about pre-Christian festivals of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, when the congregation often bursts into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands swam, flew, or were carried there by the wind or sea currents.
Due to the large distance from the continent, mammals were not able to overcome this distance, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos, a number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to observe the aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less the whole time.
Because these areas are only sparsely populated and light pollution is generally not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
The standard attire for a businessman is a suit, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key; rather than praising individual achievements, group efforts are emphasized.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
