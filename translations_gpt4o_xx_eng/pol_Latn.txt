This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, which cannot be obtained from fossils.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut on top, and underneath it was light or carotene-colored.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Due to the fact that dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but have other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – scientists have concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or for display. According to scientists, this is the plumage of an adult individual, not a chick, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
Researchers suggested that although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the feathering on the specimen indicates an adult individual rather than a hatchling.

The work was predominantly theoretical in nature, but a program was written to simulate observations of a galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect sought by the team would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon influences the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way similarly exerts its force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as standard matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo, composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant was "very problematic and worrying due to the high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients might have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were healthcare workers employed at the hospital.

Compared to the surrounding area, they have a lower temperature during the day and a higher one at night.
"The thermal environment here is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, where the temperature often remains relatively constant, but this is because we are dealing with deep openings here," said Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientific research agency and from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.
In France, voting was usually a technically simple activity: voters cast their votes in a booth and place the printed ballot with the mark of their chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once the officials verify the voter's identity, they put the envelope into the ballot box and sign the list of voters.
French electoral law quite strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers have no doubt that at the moment the polling station is opened there are no envelopes in the box and that no envelopes are being placed inside except for those properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates have the opportunity to send their representatives to observe each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Uka's weapon, aimed at the head of the fifth man, failed. Schneider experiences constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a piece of his skull, and his face is reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his homeland.
Apart from the Wednesday event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the championships.
The first event was the slalom, in which she did not finish the first run. The race ended with the same result for 36 out of 116 competitors.
She finished the second race (giant slalom) in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41:30, which is 2:11:60 slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who took ninth place.
Four skiers in the group of sitting competitors did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 skiers participating in the giant slalom were not classified.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered a stolen laptop and a mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The following individuals have been named as defendants: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when it was hit by a car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured as a result of head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh High Court accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody, awaiting indictment and trial, but the testimonies of eyewitnesses may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
It is common practice in other regions of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, with courts believing that the publication of photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Office of the Royal Prosecutor, broadly responsible for conducting investigations, informed journalists that any further comments are withheld at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will concern disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six-Day War in 1967.
According to reports, other topics that are being discussed concern the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters, as the test was monitored and subject to effectiveness evaluation.
As part of the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters' Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters' Association hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, director of protection and heritage of the NPSW park, believes that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive instruction on safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures aimed at speeding up new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes turning violent, were the result of the lack of elections, blocked in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating have been reported, which caused six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, describing them as "harmless."
When Apple postponed the release of the report, the ministry described this decision as "very unfortunate."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (which is 9:19 p.m. Universal Time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office reported that the country did not suffer any damage.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there are no signs indicating a tsunami.
A bus with tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino policeman who took the passengers as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with an M16 rifle at tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been declared dead.
Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and seniors, were released earlier.
Later, photographers took the place of the old woman, who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working in the hospital, Liggins used his free time to start research on premature birth.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate lung development in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover the black boxes.
Wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of two moons, which was as special as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... one can only hope that she is better now."
Before the 2010 federal elections, a survey was conducted among 1,400 people, and the percentage of people opposing the introduction of a republic system in Australia increased by 8% compared to the year 2008.
Supervising Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign before the 2010 elections that, in her view, Australia should become a republic with the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree with this and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme points of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events and in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but since he complained about his form, doubts arose about his expected results.
The medications necessary to alleviate the pain were prohibited by the rules of the games, so he could not take them.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor from the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By the beginning of February, several people confirmed the discovery using different equipment and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is hypothesized that comets delivered water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, particularly how this process looked in the case of Earth, because long ago comets collided with it.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year, and last month ratified a law legalizing same-sex marriages.
He described these rumors as "political gibberish and nonsense."
Speculation is being made that he will run for the office of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would enable airplanes to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The use of satellite technology instead of older generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, overground train lines will not stop at Wembley, and furthermore, car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be unavailable on the surface.
The potential lack of transportation has made it more likely that the match will take place behind closed doors without the participation of the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands belonging to Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species has emerged within just two generations, although it was believed that this process takes significantly longer, based on the breeding of Darwin's finches, small ground finches, cactus finches, and large ground finches.
Gold can be shaped into various forms, even the smallest ones.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be thinly pressed and adhered to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
We call it the pH indicator of a chemical substance. Red cabbage juice has the ability to detect pH.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in the abbreviation "pH") contained in the tested chemical substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewage system.
In the houses in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece, remnants of a sewage system were discovered.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would stay together.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away from you, you use a satellite.
The connection reaches a satellite in outer space, then almost immediately bounces it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes placed in outer space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light, and thus the image visible from Earth.
Sending a satellite or a telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways. Above all, it has made transportation much easier and faster for us.
Without him, there would be no railways, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, and even deer.
There are finally many small cats (including domestic ones) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, in the special task that each cat performs, which means it cannot compete with others.
Lions are among the most sociable cats and live in large prides.
A pride of lions consists of one, two, or three related adult males and up to thirty females and young ones.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming one large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion groups exhibit behavior similar to wolf packs or dog packs, which surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in terms of behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
The tiger, a well-built athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, leap long distances, and pull five times better than a strong human.
The tiger, along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar, belongs to the genus Panthera. Only these four species of cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's, but it rather resembles tangled, shouted words.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. Whenever possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of an ocelot's prey are much smaller in size than the ocelot itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision capabilities and move stealthily. They hunt their prey by blending into the surroundings, then pounce on their target.
In the case of a small group of living beings (a small population) being separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g., when crossing a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island without the possibility of easily retreating), they often find themselves in a different environment than previously.
In this new environment, there are various resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new traits or adapt in such a way as to be able to compete effectively in the new surroundings.
The original population has not changed at all and still needs to adapt in the same way.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, they increasingly resemble other populations less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will differ from each other to such an extent that it will be difficult to call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important element of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people emit (i.e., exhale).
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients. Plants also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, just like our clothes. Most of our food is also plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the largest predator at the time, so it only feared other mosasaurs.
In its elongated jaws, it had more than 70 exceptionally sharp teeth, and additional teeth protruded from the palate, so its victims had no chance upon encountering it.
There is no complete certainty, but he might have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and might have even been a cannibal.
He did not shy away from attacking victims in the water, and even such a huge dinosaur as T. rex had to feel respect for him.
Although we are well-acquainted with most of the dishes that the Romans ate, their feasts also featured quite exotic dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on stools, while the wealthy gathered at banquets where they ate in a reclining position.
Dishes in ancient Rome could not contain ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They did not know, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon, each deity had a main temple dedicated to it, which was considered its dwelling.
Offerings for the deities were brought by the people, while the role of the priests was to attend to divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, behind which was an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were erected, which became part of the temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located at the top of the tower.
The house did not play a particularly significant role in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women prepared meals in the yards, and the shops were simple counters facing the street. Stones were used to build dwellings.
Because there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the prices of wood were very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for committing murder, and during his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Without diminishing his role as a discoverer, it must be noted that at that time, Eskimo tribes already inhabited the area.
Although each country could be referred to as "Scandinavian," Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from each other in terms of people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a map leading to treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. There are some notes on the back of the document, but it's not a map leading to treasures.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence, the words were written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The inscription is located at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Nobody knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that initially this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was stored by being rolled up.
In this context, it can be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The landings in Normandy and subsequent battles led to the liberation of the northern part of France, but the south remained under occupation.
The authority over this was held by the French "Vichy." These were people from France who made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies launched an invasion in southern France, which was called "Operation Dragoon."
It took just two weeks for the US and Free French forces to liberate southern France and move towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture common to a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" derives from the Latin "civilis," meaning "civil," related to the word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which also somewhat indicates the size of the community.
City-states were prototypes of nations. The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, leaving a lasting cultural imprint, and fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, thus they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a fragile central government - whose only element was Congress - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state authorities, which often showed reluctance to cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
Furthermore, he had no authority to override regulations and tax rates between states.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before any changes could be made, while the states regarded the central government with such disdain that their representatives often failed to attend.
Next to the German team, the Italian national football team ranks second in the world football ranking, and in 2006 it won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports disciplines include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and athletes from Italy participate in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/groups of islands it has, Japan is often called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
When in 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in southwestern Taiwan, it began implementing changes in the indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main sites stand out: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better illustrate the original appearance of this place to visiting tourists, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, one-third of the city of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this process is still ongoing.
For example, in photography, the most commonly used format is 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, this image format has been transferred to sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is quite misleading.
The ratio for this format (we divide by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format group) are identical or closely resemble this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is often overused or ridiculed, but it serves as a simple guideline that helps achieve a dynamic effect without disrupting order.
He states that the ideal place for the main subject is the intersection point of the lines dividing the picture into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under close scrutiny.
For more than one millennium, the Christian religion provided an essential bond between European countries that differed from each other in language and customs.
His power was so all-encompassing that it affected everyone, starting with the king and ending with the peasant.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth should be used to help those who are suffering and the poor, and that church funds should be allocated specifically for this purpose.
The main ecclesiastical authority has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money raises the question of whether this doctrine is being observed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law as outlined in several international agreements made over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined areas of international waters to block ships' access to vast parts of the ocean, which put even neutral vessels at risk.
This tactic met with a limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation in the case of their ruthless underwater war operations.
The 1920s were characterized by a stance of pacifism and isolation among most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States due to his work at the Edison Company in New York.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were portrayed in a unique way; each phase in China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
In the transitional periods of interregnum between the reigns of successive dynasties, the provinces were plunged into chaos and division. The era of the Three Kingdoms, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties, is the most well-known such period.
Many dignitaries vying for the throne clashed in fierce battles during these periods.
The era of the Three Kingdoms entered the annals of ancient China as a period of great bloodshed; thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the highest throne in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, for example, the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, all male candidates had free access to professions, allowing those who showed the greatest ambition and resourcefulness to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as army ranks previously based on classes are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also served as an inspiration for many oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life. He often went to contemplate in a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (the mountain of light).
The preserved cave itself gives a very colorful idea of Muhammad's spiritual predilections.
The grotto, located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It is not easy to find her at all, even when someone knows of her existence. Inside the cave, the visitor awaits absolute isolation.
Nothing can be seen beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, it is impossible to see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World preserved to this day is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Khufu), a few smaller tombs, several temples, and also the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter "V," and the "down bow" symbol resembles a paperclip or a square without the bottom side.
Up means starting from the tip and pressing the bow, and down means starting from the frog (the place where the hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
The upward bow stroke generates a milder sound, while the downward bowing produces a stronger, more decisive sound.
Feel free to draw your own markings, but remember that the printed markings on the bow are there for musical reasons, so you should mostly stick to them.
A crowd of enraged market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and Élisabeth, the king's sister, to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the king and queen were returning to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by a rowdy crowd shouting threats at them.
The enraged mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At a certain moment, someone from the crowd waved the head of a guard killed at Versailles right in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of the imperialist United States earmarked for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds introduced to the stock exchange on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits derived from the extended exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary gains of United States imperialism.
The context in which the Knights Templar were founded is important to understanding its characteristics.
These events belong to the era commonly referred to as the late Middle Ages, which encompassed the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000–1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a wide array of ideas applied in practice, including the technological impulse or technological imperative, as well as a strict determination of human destiny governed by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general principles: first, the process of technological development is not influenced by cultural or political factors, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One can, for example, say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of road networks.
Because a nationwide road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are being developed to reduce vehicle operating costs.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, and consequently, to the invention of new medical methods for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time customs and culture associated with this geography developed, so in line with the society's location, that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is renowned today as the contemporary capital of fashion, so once Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an abode of luxury began around the year 400 AD and lasted until the year 1000 AD.
Its status diminished in the 12th century, primarily because returning crusaders brought back goods such as silks and spices, which were valued more than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because the exchange of information occurred slowly, Western styles could develop with a delay of 25–30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to shape its own style. One of the greatest achievements of those times, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming involves the farmer producing enough food to meet the needs of themselves and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using seed self-sufficiency within the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods to maximize productivity.
In the past, most farmers met only their own needs, and this is still the case today in many developing countries.
Subcultures attract individuals with similar attitudes towards the world, individuals who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, and individuals who find a sense of identity within the subculture.
Subcultures differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The distinctive features of a subculture in its uniqueness can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or they can represent a combination of various factors.
If someone is a member of a subculture, they show it through a distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most popular ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is by relying on the rare unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their upbringing—whether due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wild" or "feral." Some of them were imprisoned (usually by parents), and some were abandoned because the parents were unable to come to terms with their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or running away, the feral children might have suffered from trauma or abuse.
It is assumed that some were raised by animals, and some supposedly live in the wild on their own.
If a feral child is cared for only by animals, it behaves almost entirely (considering physical limitations) like those very animals, showing fear or indifference towards humans.
The project method should facilitate and make learning more attractive, while learning through the scaffolding method goes a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning, but rather support provided to individuals who are participating in new educational experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, meaning that the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Clippit (Clippy) in the MS Office package.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized in the software and are intended to question, suggest, and explain procedures that might be challenging for a student to understand independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide upbringing, care, and education, but unfortunately, this happens.
We believe that the foster care system provides a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is to guarantee a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and good medical care.
A foster family is supposed to meet all the needs that were not being met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet open new dimensions in the ways of usage and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "contacts with others" are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “lasting relationships” were also identified by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have enabled significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial muscle movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In the article entitled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks argues that people who, due to brain damage, do not understand speech are nevertheless able to accurately assess the speaker's sincerity.
It even suggests that such skills of interpreting human behaviors may also be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Scientific research conducted throughout the twentieth century indicates that there are two pools of genetic variability – one hidden and the other expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, whereas selection removes variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a mutual exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
Plants growing in the savanna make it difficult for primates with a digestive system like humans to meet the body's amino acid requirements.
Moreover, neglecting this may have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and pods, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest without prior cooking.
It is different with animal food (ants, termites, eggs), which is easily digested and provides large amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption involves deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after 10-60 minutes.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but doesn't fully wake you up.
If it turns out that you are turning the clock during your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend consuming a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a diuretic) before falling asleep, in order to have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to a person's internal and physical tension.
The smaller the stress, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles are our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but additionally includes the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga causes the kundalini energy (i.e., the energy of enlightenment) to awaken through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
During World War II, the USA and the USSR allied against a common enemy, which was Germany. However, when the war ended, the radical clash of systems, processes, and cultures divided these two countries.
Two years had passed since the end of the war when former allies became enemies, which marked the beginning of the Cold War.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and include real battles fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, with the only hope being a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became outdated when more than 800,000 of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading eastern Poland, thus violating the provisions of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ships is by far the most efficient way of carrying large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to provide the country with the ability to transport people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving his people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most notable examples in recent history. To assist the British, the Americans attempted to transport people and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to block these transfers.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would likely have managed to conquer Great Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats likely took place in the Iranian Zagros Mountains around 10,000 years ago.
People belonging to ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for their milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often watched over by goat herders similar to shepherds, who were usually children or teenagers. These farming methods are still in use.
Railway tracks were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were built only from parallel wooden planks, draft horses could move faster on them and transport larger loads than on the bumpy roads of that time.
Railway sleepers, on which the rails were mounted, appeared relatively early. However, it was gradually understood that to increase the efficiency of the tracks, iron strips needed to be installed on them.
It became a popular practice, but the iron contributed to the greater wear and tear of the wagon wheels made of wood.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In the year 1767, tracks made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known method of movement was walking; humans began walking in an upright position two million years ago, hence the term Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, were not in the habit of walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in the fossils of australopithecines dated to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, though it is possible that Sahelanthropus was moving on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to lead our lives in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to help reduce the scale of suffering in the future to some extent.
It often resembles symptomatic treatment. However, to avoid being limited to a temporary solution, it is necessary to identify the source of the problems and eliminate it.
It is obvious that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technical advances, and because of overpopulation and an extravagant lifestyle, the problems have worsened.
When the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4th, its handwritten version signed by John Hancock, the President of the Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few streets away.
Between 150 to 200 copies, today known as the "Dunlap broadsides," were printed overnight.
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon on the courtyard of the Independence Hall building on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it to be read to his troops on July 9 in New York. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 existing Dunlap broadsides are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The handwritten original has not survived.
Many paleontologists claim that one group of dinosaurs has survived until today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many things in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, just like a T-Rex.
Virtually all currently used computers are based on the manipulation of information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1, and such numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning does not have to manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that they do not provide grounds for an immediate diagnosis.
Poisoning is most clearly indicated by the presence of an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the instructions on the label to learn how to provide first aid for this particular poisoning.
The name beetle is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term originates from ancient times, which were familiar with bedbugs, insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest parasites, adapted to living in the nest or home of a host.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been registered, making it the most common neurological disease among adults in the young and middle age range.
MS is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to the results of the conducted studies, the risk of multiple sclerosis is twice as high in women as it is in men.
The couple may decide that raising the child is not in their interest or in the interest of the child.
These couples can decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption involves the biological parents relinquishing their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The overarching goal science sets for itself is to discover the mechanism by which the world operates using the scientific method. This method is the basis for the majority of scientific research.
However, this is not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows one or more possible hypotheses to be rejected. Asking questions and making observations also give direction to scientific research.
Classical texts, especially the Bible in its Latin translation, formed the basis of studies conducted by naturalists and philosophers.
The views of Aristotle were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West became cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often fundamentally depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms that are not only reactions to external periodic stimuli have been documented with respect to most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that persist through entire cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to inject bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were conducted, in one labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on their type, the significance of the element of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations in other locations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas, admiring landscapes, including vegetation and wildlife.
Sample activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visits to parks and gathering information about the ecosystem.
An example might be visiting Borneo, photographing, and gathering information about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small towns by car and head to work, passing by those who are traveling to the places they have just left.
As part of this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone in some way participates in the transport system based on private vehicles and supports this system.
Currently, science indicates that the vast carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from its steady state, which for two million years supported human evolution.
Everyone is a participant in social life and uses transport. Almost everyone complains about transport.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, and why are there daily irregularities in their functioning? Are the engineers responsible for them simply bunglers? Or does the problem lie much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
It is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with absolute certainty, so unfortunately, studying traffic flow presents difficulties.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior falls within a fundamentally consistent range; therefore, traffic streams also exhibit some consistency and can be approximately represented using mathematical calculations.
The relationships between three key properties, namely (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed, allow for a better illustration of traffic movement.
Planning, designing, and operating road facilities utilize these types of relationships.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly allowed them to avoid predators more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects possess the useful ability to fold their wings along their body.
Thanks to this, they have a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that are unable to fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus stated that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
There were those who thought he was right, while others held the opposite view, namely that the solar system, along with the Sun and other stars, revolves around the Earth.
It makes sense because the Earth doesn't seem like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and also the largest river in the world. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, and in some places, its width is nearly 6 miles.
The Amazon accounts for 20% of the river water flowing into the Earth's oceans.
The Amazon River in its main course is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period looked with admiration at the structures of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In its legislation and official communications, the Vatican uses the Italian language.
Most of the people working in this country use Italian in their daily lives, while Latin can often be heard during religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are of the Roman Catholic faith.
Already in antiquity, people knew the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they are present in nature in their natural form and can be relatively easily extracted using simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is a combination of at least one of the four elements. These were: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in this particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also speculated about their transformation into new substances that shape what we see.
An alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals. It should be remembered that the periodic table contains many elements.
Calcium and potassium are elements considered to be metals. Of course, silver and gold are also classified as metals.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so unimaginably microscopic that the dot at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost its status and frequency of use.
People now write messages using computer screens and don't need pencil sharpeners at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer emerges.
An atomic bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. The splitting of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that decay with a slight perturbation or even without it.
The surface of the Moon is covered by rocks and dust. The outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The cover is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under lunar seas and thicker under highlands.
On the visible side, there may be more maria regions because the crust is thinner here, making it easier for lava to break through to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying what appeals to people and resonates with them.
These theories assume that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been acquired in the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories relate to what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment causes them to do certain things and not do others.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two types of behaviors may occur. One of them is the attempt to remain "one of the crew" (or one of them).
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary actions, and shies away from evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable for their work.
The other extreme involves unrecognizably transforming into someone who feels the need to change everything the team has done so far, to align it with their own vision.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often results in friction between the leaders and the other team members.
In the case of virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply, but there are slight differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for the physically associated group directly linked with them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can arrange meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Group' is a management team to which all members report. The Invisible Group sets standards for each member."
What reason would a company have to undergo the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the learning organization concept is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity thrive when all available resources are efficiently utilized in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, collaboration within the organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to the creation of an innovative process that meets customer needs.
For an organization to become innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition. This narrows the area of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports ongoing scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, traumas, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in mental functions.
Thanks to new technologies, we can observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes occurring within it.
We draw a lot of information and materials from here to build simulation models, which allow us to better understand what happens in the human mind.
Although artificial intelligence is strongly associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very significant branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include: control and planning, the ability to respond to customers' statements and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
These things have become separate fields, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
An artificial intelligence system is frequently used today in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and also appears as an embedded element in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an essential part of every class. It often happens that the teacher would eagerly take her students to places where buses do not reach.
Technology offers the possibility of virtual field trips. Students can see museum collections, visit an aquarium, or admire works of art while sitting in their classroom.
By offering a virtual field trip, one can stimulate reflections on it and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the site is revised, but old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students make progress in writing. Often, at the beginning of blogging, grammar and spelling are not at the highest level, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
The blogger starts making efforts to improve the quality of their texts and avoid criticism, as students often render the harshest judgments.
Moreover, blogging "helps students gain a better understanding of the world around them." The need to respond to the interests of the audience inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Through the proper use of blogs, "students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online posts, they can define their own position in relation to the work of others and outline their own perspective on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with many art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
To the south of here lies Niagara Falls, and to the north one can discover the unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka district and surrounding regions.

Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them are practically deserted wilderness.
This population comparison surprises many people: the number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean to the east of the coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and due to its nature, it constitutes a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allied with France and are famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was definitely embraced in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European explorations and colonialism emerged in the 15th century when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
From the north, the region borders the Sahel, and from the south and west, it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every woman traveling should present herself as married regardless of her true marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should know that cultural differences can lead to behaviors they consider harassment, such as often being followed, grabbed by the hands, etc.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not mean that it can be this way!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BCE by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned them after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants, who had trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is at the bottom of the list in all of Morocco.
Within the old Medina, one can easily purchase traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, water pipes, and a whole range of various trinkets; however, this is a selection typically intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the eastern end of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and lava buried most of the city's streets, particularly its center.
While Goma is quite safe, any visits outside its area should be previously examined regarding the state of the fighting occurring in the North Kivu province.
From the city, one can set out for a climb up Mount Nyiragongo, as well as for tracking mountain gorillas, which is one of the cheapest options for this attraction in Africa here.
Motorcycle taxis (known as boda-boda) can be used to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
In the context of its relatively hard-to-reach location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Timbuktu is currently an impoverished city; nonetheless, its reputation attracts tourists, and there is also an airport there.
In 1990, the city was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to damage caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' special program on PBS television, "Wonders of the African World."
This city definitely differs from the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arabic than African climate.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is defined by the Crocodile River.
The park's area covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each characterized by distinct flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship among the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
Daily protection and entrance fees apply here, as in all other South African national parks.
Purchasing a wildcard can be beneficial as it allows entry to selected parks in Southern Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from Hong Kong Island, which is the most significant attraction for many tourists.
The compact rows of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a gleaming bar chart highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are offered by the Kowloon waterfront opposite the city.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so it's worth starting to search here for traces of the colonial past of this territory.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and Indian territories.
The Sundarbans have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps – they are also the last remnants of vast jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is assumed that now around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 chital (spotted deer) live there.
Buses depart from the interregional bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakar / Bumthang.
It is better to buy a ticket a few days in advance because the buses running between districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese waterfront buses, comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of transport to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that facilitates communication between the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two traffic lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened for use until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be ready for use in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs posts is expected.
The Guarani were the most important group of indigenous people in the area of present-day eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic life as hunters and engaging in agriculture to meet their own needs.
The Chaco region was the homeland of other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, which survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "great province of the Indies," was established in the 16th century as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous inhabitants.
The Spaniards initiated the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
In other months, you can also come across tournaments and competitions organized on a smaller scale.
The Argentine Polo Association offers more information about the competitions and tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Throughout the area of the islands, payments in British pounds are generally accepted; credit cards can be used in Stanley, and it is often possible to pay in US dollars as well.
You cannot count on paying by card while on the most remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; it is best to ask the owners in advance about the payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than it seems: the temperature seldom drops below zero, but combined with the wind and humidity, the feeling of cold is greater than the thermometer shows.
There are no "dry" and "rainy" seasons; the amount of rainfall is basically the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to the sight of people, they are still wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Although they may look gentle, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not keep a safe distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and inhabited by just under 40,000 people.
The founding of the city of Apia occurred in the 1850s, and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This is where the infamous naval standoff occurred in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the killing of the main leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland stretches between two bays, so there are plenty of beaches here, and the most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are sandy, with safe bathing areas, and most offer shade provided by metrosideros trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in downtown Auckland.
They are often crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops lining the waterfront. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is "Manta."
It is worth stocking up on various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may better withstand the journey.
There is no need to worry about drinking tap water here, but if anyone has doubts, bottled water is easy to find.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of a "flat white" coffee. A small black is "espresso," cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are quite expensive, but they are excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place year-round, and injuries on the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be encountered outside this period.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but their attacks on humans are rare. Most of these creatures feel fear when encountering humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead active lives in the oceans; their primary habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures that the traveler does not have to worry about whether they will have a place to sleep upon reaching their destination.
Travel agencies usually cooperate with specific hotels, although it is possible to book another form of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
In travel agency offers, we can find packages that include breakfasts, airport transportation to/from, as well as combined packages for flights and hotels.
The reservation can be extended for you if you need time to think over the offer or obtain other documents required at the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any corrections or requests should be directed first to the travel agency, rather than directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on-site, with most of them considering it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you must come early to find a camping spot close to the music.
It should be remembered that even when the musical performances on the main stages are over, in some festival sectors, music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals offer camping sites designed for families with young children.
Crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the journey through the ice creates a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visas (conditions must be checked).
Casinos generally aim for their guests to stay as long as possible and leave as much money as they can. Hence, there are no windows and clocks, and the exit is hard to find.
They usually have special offers that include meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and retain them.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but inebriation impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a sober mind.
When driving a vehicle in high latitudes or through mountain passes, one must consider conditions such as snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, there is little friction, so you cannot drive the same way as on clean asphalt.
When a snowstorm rages, it can quickly snow so much that the road becomes impassable.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or drops or ice on the car's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries where traffic proceeds without major obstacles throughout the year.
A safari is likely the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to land trips undertaken to admire the beautiful African nature, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to vehicles, and the standard equipment allows for proper viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be skittish, so it's better to observe them through binoculars.
A walking safari ("bush walk") can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and will last until September 5, 2012. Some events will be hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the year 2020 before the date change was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
The rules of appeals vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellations do not include July 2020, when the Olympic Games were to be held.
As expected, the prices of most event tickets will range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the typical ticket price will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing can speed up the drying of damp clothes. Many hotels rent out irons and ironing boards if they are not included in the room's amenities.
If there is no iron or you don't care about wearing ironed socks, you might try using a hairdryer, provided one is available.
The fabric should not be exposed to excessive heat, as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, get scorched.
Water can be purified in many ways, and some of them are more effective at combating specific threats.
Depending on the area, it is sufficient to boil the water for a minute or a few minutes may be necessary.
Filters have varying efficiency, so if you have concerns, consider purchasing bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals belonging to pests that do not occur in their native areas.
Pests destroy food, cause irritations or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, secrete venom, and transmit infections.
Usually, infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping provides an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on goods like alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the most difficult section for drivers lies between Point Marion and Fairmont, often cutting through remote forested areas.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, keep your eyes peeled, as you will often encounter steep inclines, narrow sections, and sharp bends.
Posted speed limits are significantly lower than those that apply on previous and subsequent sections (usually 35–40 mph, or 56–64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is of exceptional importance.
Interestingly, the cellular network signal here is much stronger than on many other sections of this route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are quite tasty, and those from Bavaria are notable for their wholesomeness and variety, just like in Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Baked goods with fruits are very popular: those with cooked apples are available year-round, while those with cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious dish, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

Because there are as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
Without additional specifying terms, this term usually refers to the typical cuisine of the central and eastern areas of Java, which is the most important island of the region.
Javanese cuisine, now easily accessible throughout the archipelago, includes simply spiced dishes, and the favorite additions of Javanese people are peanuts, chili peppers, and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are the rider's foot supports that hang on each side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot becomes stuck in the stirrup, the runaway horse can drag them. Various safety measures can be taken to minimize the risk of such an event.
First and foremost, most jockeys wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, particularly English ones, are equipped with safety features that cause the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if the rider falls backwards.
The Cochamó Valley – the most important climbing location in Chile, referred to as the Yosemite of South America, offering a variety of large granite walls and peaks.
From the peaks, spectacular views unfold. Climbers from all over the globe continue to chart new routes among the walls that offer countless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing or snowboarding are popular sports, which involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity on trips for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "skiing fanatics," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
Skiing has a very long history – as early as 5000 B.C.E., silhouettes of skiers were painted on cave walls!
Alpine skiing as a sport discipline dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Ski hiking: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski trips.
One can notice certain similarities to alpine skiing and climbing, however, unlike them, the route does not pass through steep terrain, and sturdier skis and boots are not needed.
Think of a ski route like a similar hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than during a walking hike, but only in rare cases will you reach running speeds, and that is provided you are without a heavy backpack, and the route is properly prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a journey through several countries would mean having to apply for many visas and undergoing many passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a single country.
As long as you remain in this zone, generally you can cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means there is no need to submit a separate visa application for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time and money and reduces bureaucracy.
There is no single universal definition determining which human-made items should be considered antiques. Some tax agencies regard any items over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition depends on the geographical location; the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted items can be called antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Many Sámi derive their livelihood from reindeer herding, and the culture associated with this industry is also important to those working in other professions.
A traditional occupation of the Sámi, which they have engaged in and continue to engage in, is not only large-scale reindeer herding but also fishing, hunting, etc., with the reindeer primarily serving as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people are employed in modern sectors. Tourism is an important branch of the economy in Lapland, where the Sámi live.
The word "Gypsy" is frequently heard, especially among people who are not Roma themselves, but it is often considered offensive because it evokes associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma.
If the country you are traveling to is subject to travel regulations, it will affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.

When planning a trip to a country considered a war zone, one should undergo professional training.
When searching the Internet for the term "Hostile Environment Training," you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, in much more detail and combined with practice.
Typically, the course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid classes, and sometimes weapon-use training.
There are numerous books and magazines readily available on the subject of survival skills, whereas publications on war zones are very scarce.
People who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must have valid documents for their return trip.
Governments have varying approaches to issuing passports without specifying gender (X) or updating names and gender in documents according to the requests of interested parties.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is equally varied.
Moreover, after September 11, 2001, security control officers began conducting much more rigorous searches.
Before surgery, transgender individuals should not expect that their privacy and dignity will not be violated during scans.
Rip currents are formed by waves breaking on a beach, reef, or similar barrier.
The underwater topology causes the return flow to occur mainly at a few deeper levels, and a fast current directed towards the deep waters may form there.
Death most often occurs due to exhaustion caused by the attempt to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
As soon as you manage to get out of the current, getting back should be no more difficult than usual.
Try to head to a place where you won't get caught in the current again, or wait for a rescue operation, considering your skills and whether someone has noticed you.
The reverse culture shock comes faster than culture shock (the "honeymoon" period is shorter), lasts longer, and can have more serious consequences.
Tourists who have adapted to a new culture without any problems sometimes have exceptional difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad for a period, you have become accustomed to a new culture and have shed some of the habits associated with your national culture.
During your first trips abroad, people probably treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that a traveler arriving in a foreign country must adapt.
People often do not anticipate that travelers returning home must also show patience and understanding.
The light and sound presentation on the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions for kids in the area.
You can view the pyramids after dark and in silence, before the show begins.

The Sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetlands are the subject of claims by several countries and have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen were operational in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas, has the largest area of all.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the water-filled caldera of an still active volcano forms a picturesque natural bay.
Ellsworth Land is located to the north of the Peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into a plateau, then re-emerge forming the 360-kilometer long Ellsworth Mountains chain, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, and the highest peak reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a mobile phone because you need to go outside and have a good view of the satellite to connect.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational vessels and during expeditions that require remote data and voice services.
Your local telecommunications service provider should provide more information about this service.
Among those who plan a year-long break, travel and learning options are becoming increasingly popular.
It is a popular solution among school graduates, which gives them the opportunity to take a gap year before starting their studies, without any detriment to their education.
Often, participating in an annual course abroad can significantly improve the chances of obtaining higher education in one's home country.
Enrollment in these educational programs usually requires the payment of a tuition fee.
Finland offers ideal conditions for relaxation on a boat. This "land of a thousand lakes" is also abundant in islands, which are numerous on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
On archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not necessarily required.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are sufficiently large for all yachts, smaller boats or even kayaks provide different experiences.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one in seven or eight people owning a boat.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand have a similar statistical indicator, yet it is still an exceptional result when compared to countries like the Netherlands, where there is one boat for every forty citizens.
An extended stay in Saint Petersburg is included in the itinerary of most Baltic cruise tours.
It means that you can explore the historic city for a few days and return to the ship at night.
If you only disembark during boat trips, you do not need a separate visa (situation as of 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin in their excursion program. The above map clearly shows that Berlin is not located by the sea or near it, so a visit to this city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic event in the past.
There is no need to be ashamed of it: it is no different from the fears and antipathies typical of many people.
Some people can overcome their fear of the unknown or the lack of control if they learn the rules of how airplanes function and the mechanisms related to flying.
Courier companies earn well from fast deliveries. Often time plays a crucial role when it comes to business documentation or goods or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but it has been problematic with regard to other routes and smaller companies.
If they shipped the packages by air transport, on some routes, unloading and customs clearance could take many days.
The only way to send it faster is to check it in as registered luggage. According to airline regulations, luggage cannot be sent without a passenger, and this is precisely the task for you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a considerable amount of money for the privilege (or even better, arrange for the company to do it for you).
However, it is an expensive option: generally, a business class ticket costs four times more than a standard economy class ticket, and a first-class ticket costs as much as eleven times more!
Essentially, it is not worth spending time searching for discounts on business or first-class seats when it comes to direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain constant group of travelers who are willing to pay any amount to reach their destination quickly and comfortably, and they take this into account when setting prices.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova, where the local language is Romanian, although Russian is also commonly used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic experiencing ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but it is not recognized by UN member states.
Despite unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, it is also the second largest port, after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once it was the ancient city of Smyrna, and now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, built around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping malls coexist with traditional roofs covered with red tiles, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere that evokes more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, you can see the nearby island of Eysturoy, and there is an unusual church built on an octagonal plan.

The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in the Catalan version, because according to the law, it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also often used in public transportation and other places.
Regular announcements on the subway are made exclusively in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are broadcast by an automated system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are considered egocentric, rude, and conceited.

We will find rare animal species there, such as the European bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must have their knees and shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, inappropriately dressed women are given a scarf, but it's worth having your own, especially a brightly colored one, to see a smile on the face of a monk or nun at the entrance to the temple.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
Men can also borrow shawls that cover the knees at the entrance, but they are not washed regularly, so not everyone will feel comfortable wearing such a shawl. One universal size for men!
The basis of cuisine in Majorca, as in other similar areas of the Mediterranean Sea, is bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as well as olive oil.

All nouns are written with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence, including the word "Sie," which is a polite form meaning "Sir/Madam" or "You" (formal).
This is an important method that allows distinguishing some predicates from complements.
It can be considered that this also facilitates reading, although difficulties arise in writing because it is necessary to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple – most words are pronounced as they are written.

Observatories from pre-modern times are now obsolete and are being converted into museums or educational centers.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of an issue as it is now, they are usually located in cities or campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge devices located in remote places where favorable atmospheric conditions prevail.
The custom of cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea originated in China, where plum flowers enjoyed the greatest popularity.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other aristocrats from the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so do not succumb to the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.

Christmas, commemorating the arrival of Jesus in the world, is one of the most important Christian holidays.
Non-believers in Christian countries and people of other faiths around the world have also incorporated into their lives many of the traditions that have developed around these holidays.
According to a certain tradition, the Easter night is spent keeping vigil in an open place and waiting for the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Churches with a more traditional approach hold the liturgy of the Easter Vigil on the evening of Holy Saturday, and the faithful often begin celebrating the resurrection of Christ when the clock strikes midnight.
All the animals that arrived on the island first swam here, flew, or came drifting on the water.

Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the work culture that people in the West are accustomed to.
A suit is the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or use a professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes group effort rather than individual achievements.
Employees usually have to obtain approval from their superiors to make decisions independently and must also follow orders without any questions.
