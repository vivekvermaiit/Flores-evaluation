This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also adds details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the creature's fur was chestnut-brown on top with a light orange-colored underside.
The meeting also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but they do have other features of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers decided that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The researchers propose that the feathers evolved not for flight, but for regulating temperature or display. The researchers suggest that, although this is the thighbone of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not of a bird.
The researchers have suggested that, even though this is a young dinosaur's feather, the example shows adult feathers and not a chick's feather.

The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic interactions.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The result that the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxies' dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravitational pull, which causes large waves, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the ninth astrological sign (Sagittarius) galaxy.
The researchers have concluded that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
The theory suggests that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around a galaxy in a sort of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very much out of order and alarming due to the very high fatality rate."

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the candidate they want in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance, following specific procedures.

In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth in the women's session group with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place finisher, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seating group failed to finish their run, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to sort in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Aria says, "We have arrested five people who robbed the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjara, Bhuta Kanjara, Rampura Kanjara, Gaja Kanjara, and Vishnu Kanjara.
Police Superintendent Shandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The street where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while rescue agencies freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred from there to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoia has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is in arrest/custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any first-hand evidence might be shrugged off because her image was widely publicized.
This is a well-known procedure elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and courts have regarded the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that journalists seem to walk a dangerous line if they publish pictures, etc. of suspects.
The Crown office, which is ultimately responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that further comments should not be made at least until an indictment.
The document, according to the statement, will discuss the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are reported to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
The State of Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years from when the agreement is signed, whereas the PA only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary festive control test will have been closely monitored by rangers, as the test was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of park conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation have received complete safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous CEO's dismissal as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The crackdown was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The often-fierce protests were driven by a failure to hold elections, some of which had already been scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Finance, Trade, and Industry (METI) said there were about 27 incidents related to the planners.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of another 34 incidents of overheating, which the company called "serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report truly "regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariane at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damages were reported to the public.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no tsunami observed.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
6 neighborhoods, including the children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the lavatory. Mendoza was later shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in the medical field.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During the time he worked in the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the child.
The spokesman reported that government investigators retrieved two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wranglers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more...love her and I'll miss her...hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 general election, those who support Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the members in the survey are in agreement, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was set to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health condition became questionable.
He was unable to take the necessary drugs to overcome his pain because they are banned from the games.
Kurtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number today on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of bringing water to the Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets crashed into the Earth long ago.
Kauma, 53, began his governorship earlier in the year and signed a bill last month that legalizes same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is considered to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to accurately locate airplanes with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Fear of a shortage in transportation has raised the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without any team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new type of creature was formed in just two generations, even though it is generally assumed that the process took much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes, it can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and braided. It can be hammered and twisted into sheets.
It can be made very thin and inserted into other metal. It can be made so thin that it was once used to cover the hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make a sign using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH measurement is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been removed from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze it together into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will feel different and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every dwelling, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilizations, toilets were often a part of an open bathhouse where men and women were together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the sphere receives the signal and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts some of our light and vision capabilities.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) that eat the countless small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of the niche, a special trait that every cat possesses which keeps it from fighting with others.
The lions are the most social cats, which live in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and young children.
The women are usually closely connected to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
The prides of lions behave quite similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very lethal to their prey.
A good athlete from all angles, the tiger can crawl (although not well), swim, leap over great distances, and drag with five times as much strength as a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. The four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a series of snarling, growling words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They will catch rodents, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals caught by an ocelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots continue to find animals to eat through their sense of smell, sniffing from where they have been on the ground.
They have very good night vision and move very stealthily. Ocelots catch their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population they come from (such as if they move over mountains or water, or if they settle on a new island and cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different means and changes to be a strong competitor compared to what they previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to acclimate to their new presence, they start to appear less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same kind.
We call this process speciation, which means only the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide which people breathe out. (That means, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We make our houses from things that grow and make clothes from things that grow. Most of the food we eat is grown. Without growing, animals could not exist.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for other Mosasauruses.
Its long mouth was lined with more than 70 knife-like teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of the mouth, meaning that it was impossible for anything that crossed its path to escape.
We do not know for certain, but it possibly had a forked tongue. Its diet included cephalopods, large fish, other marine animals, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex was not safe from it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have some interesting or unfamiliar foods, including wild boar, peacock, snail, and a creature called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on benches, the rich folks preferred to have banquets together where they could lounge on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman ever attempted a Turk.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought offerings to gods, and the priests tried to serve the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner area where only the priests can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special place for the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened openly under the sky.
Women have cooked in the yard; shops are currently open with tables looking out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was tremendously expensive.
Greenland was settled late. In the Norse legends, they say that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland because of murders, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But aside from his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already lived there at the time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences among the people, kings, practices, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever watched the movie National Treasure, it's possible that you think a treasure map is written under the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the bottom side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Freedom with the date 4th of July 1776." The words appear at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially the large format document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
If so, it is likely that the note was added simply as a label.
The D-Day invasion and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was dominated by the "Vichy" French, who were French people that made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In only two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and then moved toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture participated in by a significant large group of people who live and work together/cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning human, connected to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also reflects the magnitude of the community.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means transferring science through numerous generations, cultural achievements that endure, and equal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often vanish without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
Throughout the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with Congress being the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states valued the central government so little that their contributions were often absent.
Italy's national football, together with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are mostly popular in the northern region, with Italians competing in international games at Olympic events.
Japan consists of close to 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island nation in the world!
Due to its cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices, and providing employment for Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces captured control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded ruling over Taiwan and Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the banks of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most well-known still image photography format in the world is 35 millimeter, which was the dominant film size at the conclusion of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but much more important than this is that the aspects have been inherited by the digital camera image censorship formats.
The 35mm format is straight, slightly confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of the display (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) has therefore been said to be 3:2.
Many known formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or are very closely estimated to this aspect ratio.
The heavily-used and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that makes things lively while maintaining a semblance of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds in length and in width (see example).
Throughout the era in European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under critical observation.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion obligated European states together despite the differences in language and practices.
His penetrating power affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are specifically there for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has already been in Rome for over a thousand years, and its concentration of power and money has led to many questions about whether this belief has been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain made a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proven to be effective, cutting off important military and civilian facilities, even though the blockade was against the accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
England has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the sea, thereby causing danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited reaction to the tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing sentiments of most citizens and nations throughout the 1920s were of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, peoples wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a ledger-book, and a letter of recommendations from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China has a unique way of showing different periods; every phase of China or every family that was in power was a unique dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of fragmented provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, occurring for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasty.
Throughout the eras, wild wars took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The 'Three Kingdoms' was one of the bloodiest periods of ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people perishing while fighting to sit in the highest seat in the imperial palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to humanity and not just to one leader.
Even after the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber/knowledge.
The French Revolution also influenced many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside of his ordinary life. He would often go to a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Nur" (Light) mountain to meditate.
He himself, who has survived the times, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual desires.
Located above one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy at all to find, even though someone knows it exists. Once it's in the hole, it is a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, magnificent sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was made in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arrow" symbol looks like a V and the "down arrow symbol" looks like a staple or like a box that is missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the end and push the cane, and down means you start at the frog (this is where your hand holds the cane) and pull the cane.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to insert your own symbols, but remember that the printed bending marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on the 6th of October, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris, being surrounded by hooligans who shouted and screamed threats against the king and queen.
The masses forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
Somewhere a member of the crowd struck the head of a royal guard, who was murdered at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war costs of the U.S. imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds made in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the large profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino population would contain the main profit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the content that led to the development of the order.
The period during which the feasts took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history, during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages come after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, which generally end around 1500.
Technological willingness is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in execution, from technological drive or the technological demand to a strong feeling that human destiny is guided by an inner logic connected with scientific laws and their development in technology.
Most interpretations of technological terms have the same two general ideas: that the development itself primarily follows a path outside of cultural or political effects, and that technology in turn "affects" societies that are inherited, and not under social conditions.
For example, one could say that the motor car automatically leads to the development of highways.
However, a nationally extensive road network is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars; therefore, new methods of production are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
A high number of car owners also leads to a higher occurrence of accidents on the highways, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the medical field for healing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determination, drawn out by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography merged with the individual, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography emerged, and those, being at peace with the place of society, were better than unintelligent established laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital for the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital in ancient Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury starting from around 400 A.D. and lasting until around 1100 A.D.
The status of it diminished throughout the twelfth century, mostly as a result of the fact that crusaders returned bringing gifts like silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine market had offered for them.
There was a time when the transition of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style was at its highest peak during the period between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
Nevertheless, due to the solid communication channels, styles in the West can be lagging by 25 to 30 years.
Closer to the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system utilizing saved seeds native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other quite simple methods to achieve the most plants.
Historically speaking, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case today in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together similar people who feel alienated by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of their own identity.
Subcultures can be somewhat different due to the age group, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, regional, or a combination of these things.
Members of a subculture often signify their membership through a typical and emblematic use of style, which includes fashion, etiquette, and slang.
One of the most well-known methods used to illustrate the importance of society is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or willful abuse, have not had interaction with adults while growing up.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Certain feral children have been confined by people (mostly their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to the parents' refusal to accommodate a child's severe intellectual or physical limitation.
Especially children might have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before becoming abandoned or running away.
Others are suggested to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild world alone.
When entirely raised by non-human animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (with physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the particular caregiver animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step too far.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internal in the software and are made to prompt, assist with, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons including neglect, abuse, and even trafficking.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, does not show emotion, and does not provide education, but they do.
We regard the foster care system as a protection zone for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The obvious character of the internet leads to different sides of usage and satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing connection" were also identified as new motifs by Imai and McCard (1998), when they observed viewer reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few seconds.
Separately, it is reported that someone can detect if a person is lying by correctly analyzing micro-expressions.
Eliyahu Saks, in his paper on the president's speech, demonstrated how people who can't understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess truthfulness.
He even suggested that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic mutations: latent and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic differences, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed differences.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from plant resources available there.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: increasing depression, malnutrition, and premature death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are harder for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, foods for animals (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into account, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in roughly the same way that chimps on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a quieter alarm clock to bring you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in the middle of sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other diuretic-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, which forces one to get up to go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses corresponds inversely with the amount of tension present within one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more the positive life force is present. Every person has the opportunity to find complete peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been extended by the Mahayana path of compassion and by many methods of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of pure love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the depiction of certain deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the contrasts in systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries falling out.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had started.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would have been opposed exactly, by representative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize once again throughout the Roman bridgehead.
However, the plans were completely altered practically overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the northern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the fastest way to move large numbers of people and goods across water.
The work of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and things while, at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and things.
One of the remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to help transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat England as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely the first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were commonly kept in groups that roamed over mountains and other vegetated areas, often herded by goatherds. The goatherds were often children or young men, very similar to the more widely known shepherds. These methods of herding are still in use today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and carry heavier loads than on the somewhat heavier roads.
Rail fastenings became known quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that it would be more effective if there were an iron bar on top.
This had become a common occurrence, but the iron had more worn down the wooden wheels on the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels took the place of iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails came out.
The first known form of transportation was walking; people began walking right two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, typically did not walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
This is exactly like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we want something that is not just a temporary solution, then we should find the underlying problems and de-activate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have worsened due to overpopulation and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, then sent a few streets away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it to be read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds, but which still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with claws and nails, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind feet like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, like 0 or 1, and the numbers are called binary digits—or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal consolidation may not always appear immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are very general and an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open box of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Observe the sign for specific first aid instructions for that particular drug.
The title insect is used by entomologists in a formal context for the group of insects.
The word comes from an old acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects easily adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, being accustomed to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that females are twice as likely to have MS as males.
A couple can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
The families can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that the other couple can be parents for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually leads most scientific research.
However, it is not enough alone, experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible assumed approaches, asking questions, and making observations also accompany scientific research work.
Naturalists and philosophers have looked at classical texts and, specifically, at the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Since the knowledge of the Greek language has diminished, the Western world has found itself cut off from its Greek philosophers and scientific heritage.
Many accepted rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on whether endogenous cycles exist and are produced by biological clocks.
Temporal rhythms, which are not simple responses to external temporal signals, have been documented for most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run several free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Changes can also have several other effects depending on the type of change, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only changes in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, whereas changes in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places for the purpose of enjoying the landscapes, including flora and fauna.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about architecture in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplaces and pass by others whose workplace is where they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that the massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
And in developed countries, one rarely hears similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems involve such backlogs? Why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply inept? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic law is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a logical and consistent order; so, traffic streams tend to have a bit of logical consistency and can be more or less determined mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, connections were made between the three main character traits: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The relationships help with the planning, layout, and the operation of the train facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily invade enemies and find food and travel more capably.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back to the length of their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from their pursuers.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought that he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the globe, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems understandable, since the world doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their grandeur and the technical excellence of their construction.
New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt marveled at their previous monuments, which were already well over a thousand years old even then.
Vatican City's population is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the usual language used by those who work in the state, whereas Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about key chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in their native form and are quite easy to unearth with simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, expressed the theory that everything is made from a combination of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of things (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small number of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Every thing in the world is made of material, all materials are made of tiny pieces which are called atoms.
Atoms are so wonderfully small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, lead was relegated to a lower status and usage.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never having come close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. Splintering the nucleus again releases a bit of energy once more.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer part of the moon is called the crust.
The layer is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
There is dinner under the canopy and thicker under the highlands.
It may be more marshy on the nearer side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what upsets people and what they like.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were ingrained while they were developing into adulthood.
The theories look at what is certain about certain people that makes them want the things they do and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two tendencies can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or buddies).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary steps, making assessments, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the group has already done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This kind of conduct often results in splits between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to the same standards as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual group members often function as the point of contact for their current physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional group members because their group can meet according to different time zones, which might not be comprehensible to their local administration.
The presence of a real "virtual team" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across the active departments of an organization, wisdom can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new advanced process to serve the needs of the buyers.
Before an organization can be progressive, leadership must foster a culture of progressiveness as well as communicate knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuance path as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of achievement.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring perception. Therefore, it narrows down the field of study to make it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behaviors and bring changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong implication/connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with reasoning, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent work.
Templates include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial recognition.
Such matters have become separate disciplines, which emphasize providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the world of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as built into several home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Quite often, a teacher will love to take her students to places where one cannot travel by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in their class.
Sharing a field trip report is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year, the website is redesigned from scratch, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogs with a mix of grammar and writing, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to cater to the interests of the audience urges students to be smart and interesting/engaging (Tauteau 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to take their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can clarify their position in comparison to others' descriptions as well as express their own perspectives on certain issues (Arovek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Deeper in the south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond that.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered officially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a comparison of populations that astonishes many people: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, close to the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by all accounts the largest, and is in a league of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or connected with France and known as luxury seaside resort destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it was very well adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelers say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should note that cultural differences can result in what they would consider as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men, and do not be afraid to stand strong (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese ruined it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but later had to leave after another earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, items made from lime, leather goods, hookahs, and a large selection of gewgaws, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially in the city center.
Although Gamma is quite secure, every visit outside of Gamma should be investigated to understand the situation of the conflicts that are happening in the northern Kiuva province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano together with one of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking options in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The local price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Together with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for beautiful, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although the good reputation it possesses makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major highlights during Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has a stronger Arab appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 other ecozones, each supporting different forest animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANparks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be useful for someone to buy a wildcard, which provides access to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists claim to be their main focus.
The arrangement of buildings that create the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a dazzling candlestick chart that becomes more prominent with the view of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head out to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily focused on reclaimed land near the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladesh and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The portion of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining parts of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered in water/marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the sub-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but mostly, especially those going to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Taxis shared with others is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, like Faro (Nu 150) and Funcho (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lines with a width of 3.50 meters.
The maximum height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most remarkable indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture.
The Choco lowlands were inhabited by other groups of primitive tribes like the Gueisoro and Payagua, who existed by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indians," was born as a result of a clash between Spanish forces and the local native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has endeavored to retain much of its traditional character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the Polo Fields in Las Canitas.
Small competitions and scuffles can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, look for Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland Islands currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley; credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American cash can be accepted; consult with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, therefore exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30º Celsius are normal.
The winter can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and dampness together make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. The animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so therefore, give them their space.
In addition to this, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Afiyo is the capital of Samoio. The town is on an island of Ofailo and has a population of slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is the location of the sadly famous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships have sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the war for independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the town ended with the killing of the main chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many shores due to Auckland's straddling of two harbors. The most popular are in the three areas.
The north shores (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with secure swimming, and most are provided with shade given by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive shores are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburban parts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Often they are filled family shores with a good span of businesses that stand along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One," it is not a complicated beer, but a tasty and refreshing one. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines available, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino comes topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards. Fruit soaps are expensive but very good.
Many journeys to the summit are made year-round, and injuries due to one of the factors are rare.
You should still take instructions from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the shore and near river waterways from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they hardly ever attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodations, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually arrange packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to provide other documents for your purpose (e.g., visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the majority of the participants of music festivals decide to sleep on-site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get in early enough to secure a camping site near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main platforms has ended, there may be parts of the performance that will continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you wander across the Northern Baltic in the winter, check the cabin location, since passing ice creates a terrible racket for those who are most affected by it.
Saint Petersburg districts include time in the shtetl. Cruiser/passenger district are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to get the most out of the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and arranged entertainment to keep guests in a good mood, and they keep them in the place.
Some places offer drinks at one's own expense. But being intoxicated damages composure, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Someone traveling to high latitudes or over mountains should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is weak and you cannot drive as you would on just asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to make you stuck in very little time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by rain or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourism attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The title "safari" in popular usage refers to overland trips to look at the wonderful African wildlife, mainly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for a good view.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are occasionally shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or walking "footing") involves walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, because the 1964 games were held there.
If you booked your flight and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, then you possibly have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies are different, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board ready for use on request, even if no one is present in the room.
If it is not possible to have a clothes iron, or you do not want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to allow material to become too hot (as this can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, to become burnt).
There are other methods of purifying water, some are more effective against certain threats.
In certain places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others, a few minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have a concern, you should then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers can encounter animals that they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Parties can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people through force, do not qualify as pets.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes at specific locations.

The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through the isolated underwood terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: sudden grades, narrow lanes, sharp turns dominate there.
The posted maximum speeds are significantly lower than in the previous and next sections – averaging 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than not.
Interesting, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in any other area, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the nation.
But if further qualifiers are used, the title usually means the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply spiced foods, the strongest flavors being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the riders but can have safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but remains with a foot caught in the stirrup, then he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most passengers wear travel boots with a heel and a very narrow, smooth sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is dragged backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a selection of granite massive walls and crags.

Snow sports such as skiing and snowboarding, which involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet, are popular sports.
Skiing is a major traveling activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski bums, who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
Skiing is very old - cave drawings show skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is a sport that dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is connected, but usually does not include alpine-style ski tours or mountain climbing, the latter carried out in extreme territories and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of a skiing trail as a similar walking path.
In good circumstances, you will be able to cover somewhat larger and broader distances than when walking on foot – but only in rare cases will you achieve the speed rate of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Traveling through many countries under normal circumstances would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen Area, however, works somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in the zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member states separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no accepted opinion on what manufactured items are considered antique. Some tax agencies call goods older than a hundred years antique.
The opinion has geographical variations, where the vintage limitations can be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products may be defined as antique, even though they are younger than similar machine-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is significant also for many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, having reindeer herders as draft animals.
Today, Sami work in modern jobs. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.

For example, American citizens in the Middle East may have to deal with different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are simply a brief overview of the political situation in one country.
The perspectives presented are often brief, superficial, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.

A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically last from 2-5 days and will include role-play, a lot of first aid, and a few times weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with existing in the wild are well-known, but publications that deal with war zones are rare.

Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity untouched.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that strike the seashore/beach, often near the shore or similar areas.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated on a few deeper parts, and a fast wave to deep water might possibly form there.

As soon as you come out of the rapids, swimming back is not harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you haven't been caught again or, relying on your experience, and if you have been noticed, you might want to wait for a rescue.
Re-entry shock comes faster than culture shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more serious.
Travelers who had to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and you have lost a bit of the habits of your home culture.
When you first arrived abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid of sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see it in silence before the performance begins.

The scenes are being displayed on the pyramids and the other pyramids are being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a wonderful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km chain of the Alps, intersected by the Minnesota glaciers.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 meters with Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not take the place of a mobile phone, because you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a telephone call.
The service is very often used by shipping, including pleasure hand work, as well as expeditions that have long-distance data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about subscribing to the service.
A very popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel around and learn.
This is especially known for school leavers, it allows them to take off one year before university, a break from their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a mid-year course abroad can improve the chances of advancing into higher education back in your homeland.
Usually, there will be a tuition cost to enroll in the educational programs.
Finland is a strong ship destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands too, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and rivers, you don't necessarily need to have a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, placing smaller ships or even a kayak provides a different experience.
Traveling by ship is a national pastime in Finland, with one ship per every seven or eight people.
This is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from that quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, it is one in forty).
Most of the remarkable Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few eventful days and return and sleep on a ship at night.
If you travel to the country only with a cruise, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises list Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map, Berlin is not at all near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have had other trauma.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Companies that specialize in sending packages are well paid for sending things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an important repair.
On some of the routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it was a problem.
If they were to send things via air freight, certain routes would take days to clear customs.
The only way to make it go through faster is to send it as checked luggage. Airport regulations will not allow them to send it as luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The straightforward way to fly in first or business class is to spend a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap; as the rule suggests, you can expect to pay more than four times higher than the normal economy fare for business and eleven times higher for first class.
Generally speaking, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain main group of travelers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital city of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of a self-declared Transnistrian republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations have been renewed between the two parts of Moldova despite its failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.

Parisian sharp outdoors will progress quickly if you display a few main delicacies.
The Plitvice National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and contains a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly wide selection of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different types of soil, and many levels of elevation.

At the same time, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the many things at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing the aprons. One size fits all for the men!
Majorcan cuisine (the Majorcan kitchen), like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.

Pre-modern observatories are usually not found or are obsolete nowadays, and remain as museums or places of education.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they were usually found in towns or near campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing where cherry blossoms bloom, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the royal court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, therefore resist the temptation to remove even one specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, then collecting "specimens" will also expose you to being thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
However, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with both heat (always) and intense sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).

There is a tradition to spend the Easter night awake at an open spot to see the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for the tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregations frequently breaking into the celebration soon after midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands got here by swimming, flying, or floating on the water.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals cannot make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humanity to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar nights, which means the sun will not shine over the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be dark more or less around that time.
Since the areas have a small population, and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West may be accustomed to.
Jackets are standard business attire, and coworkers address one another by last names or job titles.
