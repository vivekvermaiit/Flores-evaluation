Although it appears that one experimental vaccine may reduce mortality from Ebola, it has not yet been clearly proven that any medications are suitable for treating the current infection.
One of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this area, but studies have shown that it is not as effective in preventing deaths as was thought.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a starting point and compared the other three treatments to it.
"USA Gymnastics" supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and agrees that it is essential for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOC) that significant changes in our organization, rather than its dissolution, would serve the interests of our athletes and clubs and benefit their sports.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs were feathered (a widely accepted theory), but it also provides data that fossils typically cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the feathers on the top of this animal were chestnut brown, while the ones on the underside were pale or carotenoid-colored.
This discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, known as a rachis, but do have other feather features (barbs and barbules), researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flying, but more for regulating temperature or for display purposes. Researchers believe that although this is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows an adult's feather covering, not a chick's down.
Researchers stated that, although it is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult feathering, not a juvenile's down.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observations of the Sagittarius constellation.
The effect that the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as any ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is concentrated in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

"During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer."
"Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is normal considering that these are deep holes in the ground," stated Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an activity not very associated with technology: voters enter a booth and place a sheet of paper marked with the candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
The French election law quite strictly codifies the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no other envelopes are added, only those properly counted and cast by voters with the right to vote.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers, monitored by strict observers, count the votes following specific procedures.

This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the time of the winner, Claudia Loesch from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the time of Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four groups of seated women skiers failed to complete their slalom, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom event did not earn any ranking.
Police officers working in Madja Pradeš found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped a Swedish woman and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
Defendants: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered a severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been tried at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is arrested and awaiting charges and trial, but any witness testimonies may be compromised because her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts believe that publishing photos may cause harm.
Dandi University professor Pamela Ferguson states that "journalists seem to be walking on the edge of an abyss when publishing photos of suspects and so forth."
The royal service overseeing all criminal cases told journalists that no further comments would be provided at least until the charges are formulated.
The leaked document points to a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants, taking into account the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
As knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West found itself distanced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years when the agreement is signed, whereas the Palestinian Authority agrees to only five years.
The shooters who participated in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by the park rangers because the trial was being observed, and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been selected for the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to NPWS park protection and heritage director Mick O'Flynn, the four marksmen selected for the first shooting operation underwent a comprehensive safety and training briefing.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the nine-member interim electoral council (CEP).
Martelis is meeting with the Interim Election Commission for the fifth time in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures aimed at transitioning the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Without holding elections, some of which have not been held since 2011, protests erupted with outbreaks of violence.
A total of 60 cases of overheating malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that "Apple" reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling the delay in the "Apple" report "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday, 09:19 p.m. GMT).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, residents have not reported any damage.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolandas Mendoza fired an M16 gun at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and it has been confirmed that at least six are dead so far.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children and the elderly, as well as photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and began his career in the field of medicine.
He studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liginsas began to research premature contractions in his spare time.
His research showed that using the hormone accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
"Xinhua" reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered data from the "black box" recorders of the two flights.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer has said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme situations." My first mentor. Luna died on the night of two moons. Completely uniquely, as she was herself. A strong woman."
Dastin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as much of an oddball as I was... Maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place now."
Even before the 2010 federal elections, a survey of 1,400 people revealed that the opponents of Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard affirmed her belief that Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
This opinion is held by 34 percent of respondents who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Speaking of radical responses, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medalist in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle swimming events and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have raised doubts about his physical condition.
He could not take painkillers because they are prohibited during the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
By the end of February, several people tested the invention using various software and hardware, and it was reported on Tuesday.
It could be that comets brought water and organic materials to Earth, which can create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo became governor in '53 earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
"NextGen" is a system whereby the FAA claims that if aircraft were to fly shorter routes, it would save millions of liters of fuel annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the older ground radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can more accurately identify aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport, overground trains will not stop at "Wembley", and parking as well as "park and ride" services will not be provided.
Fear of transport shortages prompted consideration of the possibility that the matches might be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in the journal "Science" on Thursday reports the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer due to the crossbreeding of the endemic medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the immigrant large cactus ground finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
By drawing it out, a thin wire can be made, which can be twisted or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice indicates how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in the abbreviation pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix both kinds of powders, then with clean wet hands, compress them into a ball.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, which are not very clean, and will form a kind of protective shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in homes in the cities of the Minoan civilization on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets already existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women would be together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite communication.
A satellite in space receives a signal and almost instantly returns it.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and image.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a massive 100-foot (about 30 meter) tall rocket is required.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest benefit of the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
He provided us with a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Another group consists of medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And lastly – small cats (including domestic cats living in the wild), which eat a much more varied prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of the right place – a special task that each cat must perform and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The family consists of one to three adult males related by kinship and up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to each other – like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions operate similarly to packs of wolves or dogs (animals very similar to lions, but not to other cats) and are also merciless to their prey.
The tiger, a large and athletic animal, can climb (though not perfectly), swim, leap long distances, and has five times the pulling strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar does not compare to the thunderous roar of a lion. It is more like a loudly growled sentence.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals hunted by ocelots are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals they intend to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They see very well in the dark because they have night vision capabilities, and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the environment, then seizing it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belonged (e.g., crosses a mountain range, swims across a river, or relocates to a new island and cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment that is different from the one they previously lived in.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so for the new population to be a strong competitor, it will need different traits or changes than before.
The initial population has not changed at all; they still require the same adaptation.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it starts to appear less and less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be classified as the same species.
We call this process the formation of new species. The formation of new species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and it is part of the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce food from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Many of the foods we eat are plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
The mosasaurus was the most powerful predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In his long jaws, there were more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there were also teeth in the upper part of the mouth, meaning that nothing crossing his path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but the tongue might have been forked. It fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps was even a cannibal.
He would attack anyone who entered the water. Even a huge tyrannosaurus would not compare to him.
Many of their foods will be familiar to us, but the Romans also had strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, while rich men liked to hold feasts during which they would recline on their sides while eating.
Dishes of the ancient Romans could not contain food products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa; no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, considered the house of the god.
People would make sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods during rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, as well as an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as parts of temples.
A special temple for the god was established at the top of the tower.
Given the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women were preparing food in the yard. The shops consisted of mere open counters facing the street. Stones were used in building the houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Ancient Scandinavian sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, traveling further west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is considered "Scandinavian," there are quite a few differences related to the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there was a treasure map drawn on the other side of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the other side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the other side of the Declaration of Independence, there was an inscription: "The Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (its size is 29.75 x 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that this note was simply written as a title.
During the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still occupied.
That part was governed by the Vichy French. These French collaborated with the Germans in 1940, working together instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France – the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces managed to liberate the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a particular culture characteristic of a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil, is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and also somehow defines the size of a community.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of civilization means the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, a continuing cultural heritage, and considerable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government (whose only part was Congress) based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to regulate taxes, and since there was no national executive branch or judicial system, it relied on the state authorities, which, in carrying out all their actions, mostly did not cooperate.
She also did not have the authority to disregard tax laws and tariffs between states.
To be able to amend the articles, unanimous consent of all states was required, and the states were so indifferent to the central government that their representatives often did not participate.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the Germany national football team, and became the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions – Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster of islands / group of islands that Japan has, it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century when it was visited by European sailors who named it "Ilha Formosa," which means "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, beginning to transform the native grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were rebuilt so that tourists can better understand how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm. This frame size dominated towards the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The name of the 35 mm format is misleading; in fact, it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the smallest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format family) are equivalent or very close to this video format.
The often overused and mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and maintains some order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, attracted a lot of attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite differences in languages and customs.
Her all-encompassing power affected everyone – from the king to the common person.
One of the main Christian principles states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's treasury is intended precisely for this purpose.
The central Church authority had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question whether such a doctrine was being adhered to.
Shortly after such aggression, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international law, legitimized by several international treaties made over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters so that no ships could enter any parts of the ocean and pose a threat even to inactive state ships.
Since the tactics were poorly responded to, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most people and entire nations lived with ideas of pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer at the Edison Company, which was based in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of revealing different periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Moreover, the interregnum of dynasties was a period of instability for the divided provinces. The best-known period of this kind is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the rule of the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, fierce wars took place among the many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands perished fighting for the right to sit on the main throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
After the revolution, all willing men could participate in occupations where success smiled upon the most ambitious and successful ones.
The same can be said about the army – now military ranks were granted based on personal qualities, not on class.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working-class people in many other countries to stage their own revolutions.
Mahomet was very interested in things that lie beyond the boundaries of everyday life. He often visited the cave on Mount Noor (light), which became known as "Hira", to immerse himself in contemplation.
The cave itself, having withstood the test of time, provides a very vivid depiction of Mahomet's spiritual inclinations.
The cave was on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, therefore completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if you knew that such a cave existed, it is not easy to find it. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing to see, only the clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau (also known as the "Giza Necropolis"), located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a few small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The "upper crushing" mark looks like a V, and the "lower crushing mark" is like a clamp or a square without the bottom part.
"Up" means you should start from the tip and push the bow, while "down" means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A softer sound is usually produced with the upper bow stroke, while a stronger, harsher one is produced with the lower bow stroke.
Feel free to write notes by hand, but remember that printed notes are there for musical reasons, so this should generally be respected.

By carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of the U.S. imperialist war intended to conquer the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were convinced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the majority of expenses and the interest on bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government (but utilizing Wall Street banks).
Of course, profit obtained from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos was the primary income of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is essential to know the context that led to the creation of the order.
The epoch in which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages is the period between the Early and Late Middle Ages. It is generally considered that the latter ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses various practical ideas—from technological advancement or necessity to the precise meaning that human destiny is determined by an internal logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself proceeds in a direction fundamentally surpassing cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on society that is inherent rather than dependent on social conditions.
For example, someone might say that creating a car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable if only a few cars use it, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The widespread prevalence of cars on the roads increases the number of accidents, which contributes to the invention of new healthcare methods for treating bodily injuries.
Romanticism is characterized by cultural determinism, adopted from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, people were shaped by geography, and over time, customs and culture emerged related to it, which, in harmony with the place of society, were more suitable than randomly imposed laws.
Just as Paris is now famous as the fashion capital of modern times, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It gained fame as a luxury epicenter around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status diminished mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished during the period between the 10th–11th and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication, styles sometimes reached the West after 25–30 years.
As the Middle Ages were coming to an end, a distinct style began to emerge in Western Europe. One of the most important changes that came about due to the Crusades was that people started fastening clothes with buttons.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to grow enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses local ecoregion seeds and employs crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to enhance fertility.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and many in developing countries still do.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel out of place with societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary according to the age of members, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their membership uniquely and symbolically through style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most popular ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to take several examples of unsuccessful children who were not socialized due to adult negligence or intentional abuse as they were growing up.
Such children are called "unmanageable" or wild. Some unmanageable children were isolated from society by people (usually their own parents); sometimes these children were abandoned because the parents did not recognize the child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe violence or trauma before being abandoned or before running away.
Others were suspected to have been raised by animals; some lived independently in the wild.
If a wild child is raised by animals and not people, he behaves (within the limits of physical possibilities) almost the same as the animal that took care of him, for example, he fears people or ignores them.
While project-based learning is supposed to facilitate learning and make it more interesting, scaffolded learning is even more beneficial.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but a form of assistance for individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but the same can be said about the Microsoft Office paperclip.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to consider, encourage, and explain procedures that pose difficulties for the student, which they cannot handle alone.
Children end up in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to violence and even rape.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but this happens.
We believe that the foster care system is like a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Guardians should provide the child with everything that was lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The internet connects elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the internet lead to the emergence of additional dimensions in terms of usage and fulfillment of desires.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
J. Eighmey and L. McCord (1998), while studying audience reactions to a website, also identified new aspects of motivation – "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships."
Using video recordings has revealed important discoveries in explaining facial expressions and movements that last several milliseconds.
First of all, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks argues that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are perfectly able to recognize sincerity.
He even claims that such an ability to understand human behavior can also be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the combined sample of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination lead to the mixing of variants in two groups of each generation.
In the savanna, it is challenging for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of a human, to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Such a deficiency has serious consequences: stunted growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible protein sources would be plant leaves and pods, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them raw.
On the contrary, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a lot of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, you should not be surprised that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in almost the same way as today's chimpanzees on the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the purposeful awakening during regular sleep and falling back asleep after a short period of time (10–60 min.).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, which will bring back your consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you turn off the alarm while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another alternative based on biorhythms is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as this will make the sleeper wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more confident and alive you feel. Every person can find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle preventing you from reaching this goal is your tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has expanded with the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga methods.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through various yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Center is "Deity Yoga." By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment is attained.
During the Second World War, Germany was the common enemy that prompted cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to confrontation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
This continued for another 40 years, with real fighting using mercenary armies from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had already been overcome, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became outdated almost overnight, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army, having entered the eastern regions of Poland, violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods is still the most efficient way to carry large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the work of the navy has been to ensure the movement of people and goods in your country and to prevent the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples was the Second World War campaign in the North Atlantic. The Americans attempted to transport troops and materials across the Atlantic to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mostly using submarines, tried to stop the transportation of these cargoes.
If the Allies had lost, Germany probably could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
According to available data, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains located in Iran.
Ancient peoples and tribes began to keep them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds, wandering on hills or other pastures, often looked after by goat herders, who were typically children or teenagers, much like the more commonly known shepherds. This practice continues to this day.
Railways appeared in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage roads consisted of only wooden boards laid parallel, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages to do so faster, and it was possible to pull larger loads than on the less smooth roads of that era.
Sleepers were created quite a long time ago to reinforce the tracks. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks are more effective when covered with metal.
It became common practice, but iron would wear down the wooden wagon wheels more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of travel was walking. People began to walk upright two million years ago – that was when Homo Erectus (the upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not always walk upright.
Signs of adaptation to walking on two legs are visible in australopithecus fossils dated to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus might have been able to walk on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living less harmfully to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and even be activists to some extent to reduce the likelihood of suffering in the future.
In many cases, it is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find and eliminate the root causes of the problems.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to human scientific and technological achievements, and problems have grown due to overpopulation and an extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides", were made overnight.
The document was publicly read for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One such document was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of the document reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five still existing copies of Dunlap, known to exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have still retained many similarities to dinosaurs.
Their feet had scales and claws, they laid eggs and walked on two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Essentially, the basis of all computers used today is the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, which are 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or in computer jargon – bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general in nature, which may result in a failure to immediately establish a diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Find the first aid instructions for the specific substance the poisoning is from on the label.
Entomologists formally use the term "bug" to name this group of insects.
This term arose because of the bedbugs known in ancient times - these insects are well adapted to be parasites of humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are endophilic, adapted to living in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it considered a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their or their child's best interests.
These couples can make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that the child can have another couple as parents.
The main goal of science is to determine the existence of the world and related matters by applying the scientific method. This method is actually crucial in many scientific studies.
However, it is not the only thing – the experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, and observations also help to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers primarily focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views became popular in all branches of science, including psychology.
The Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was set on fire during the riots.
The majority of observed physiological and behavioral rhythms often heavily depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation influenced by biological clocks.
It has been observed that periodically recurring cycles, which are not a response to recurring external stimuli, are present in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain cyclicity even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important in proving that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only cell mutations at the germ level can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural sites to enjoy the scenery, including wild flora and fauna.
The activities offered on-site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting orangutans, photographing them, and learning about them in Borneo.
Every morning people drive out of small towns in their cars to get to their workplaces, while others pass by them whose workplace is in the area the first group has just left.
In this dynamic vehicle routing system, everyone is somehow connected and supports the vehicle system based on private cars.
According to science, this large-scale carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the life of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they experience problems every day? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is the problem more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the science of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complicated because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with one hundred percent accuracy.
It is great that drivers tend to behave relatively consistently on the road; thus, traffic flows generally have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately calculated mathematically.
To better convey traffic flow, the relationships between three main characteristics are determined: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid predators and more effectively find food and mates.
The advantage of many insects is that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
It allows them to hide from predators in many small places.
Today, the only insects unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System along with the Sun (and other stars) moved around the Earth.
That seems logical, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, almost 10 km wide.
20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids were built from stones until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical perfection.
The New Kingdom ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 residents. It is the smallest independent state in the world, with the fewest residents.
Italian is used in Vatican legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language that is used daily by the majority of state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican residents are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been knowledgeable about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as they can be found in nature in their usual form and are easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also developed the theory that they transform into new materials, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals too – silver, gold.
You can also have alloys with small amounts of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil that appeared was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status of the pencil has weakened, and its usage has decreased.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens and they never need to look for a pencil sharpener.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will become with the advent of some newer technology.
The operation of a nuclear bomb is based on the principle that a lot of energy is needed to maintain a nucleus that contains many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus splits again and releases some energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are not stable, meaning they tend to decay with little or no friction.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearer side and 100 km thick on the farther side.
She is thinner under the Moon sea and thicker under the highlands.
The near side may have more lunar seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on the search for what activates people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
These theories examine what makes certain people want what they do, and what environmental factors compel them to do certain things or not to do them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Simply put, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior can emerge. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" or "one of the girls."
Such leaders find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary actions, evaluate work, assign duties, and manage people.
On the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who thinks that the entire team's work needs to be changed to make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often causes disagreements between managers and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members are often contact persons for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than regular team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of genuine "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
“The invisible team” is a management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization spend a lot of time creating a training organization? The goal of applying organizational training concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the organization is working together to overcome the obstacle and create a new process that satisfies the client's need.
For an organization to become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angelas (2006) explains the method of continuity as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides evidence of the physical aspects of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the field of scientific research and make it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior confirms the scientists' research hypothesis.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the emergence of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and study yet unseen brain structures and processes.
It provides us with a lot of information and material that helps to create simulation models and better understand processes.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that explores the issues of behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Investigating AI-created machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent actions.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, and voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also integrated into several home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are an important part of any class. Quite often, teachers would like to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution – virtual tours. Students can explore the historical tools in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a tour virtually is an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future groups.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital; every year this website is reconstructed, but the old versions are preserved online as a memory album.
Moreover, blogs can improve students' spelling. Although students' grammar and spelling in their initial blogs are often careless, the existing audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer strives to write as perfectly as possible to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogging "encourages students to think more broadly about the surrounding world." The need to engage the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning beyond the walls of a traditional school.
Appropriately used, blogs can help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively responding to online material, students can express their position in consideration of other people's posts as well as describe their own perspective on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums where Canada's past and future merge.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies the captivating untouched natural beauty of Lake Muskoka and other areas.
All these and other things in Ontario are considered elements of true Canada by newcomers.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated, and in some places, there are almost uninhabited wildernesses.
A comparison of populations that surprises many: There are fewer Canadian citizens than African Americans living in the USA.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean along the eastern African coast.
Madagascar is the largest island, and, when it comes to wildlife, it can be called a separate continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are famous for resorts established on luxurious beaches.
Moreover, the Arabs brought Islam to the islands, and it took strong root in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India by bypassing the Cape of Good Hope.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west, by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Additionally, it is advisable to wear a ring (just not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, they may experience what they might consider harassment. Someone might start to follow them, grab their hand, or the like.
Firmly push back against men and don't be afraid to stick to your principles (cultural differences do not mean that such behavior is appropriate).
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, known by the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading posts here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping places in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but all of this is meant for tourists.
Goma is a city frequented by tourists in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded a large part of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is quite safe, before traveling outside of Goma, it is advisable to gather information that will help understand the state of the ongoing conflicts in North Kivu province.
From this city, it is also possible to climb Mount Nyiragongo and book one of the cheapest treks in Africa to watch mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Given its difficult accessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor describing exotic and distant islands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists; the city has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites that are endangered due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' special PBS show "Wonders of the African World."
The city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic, rather than African, style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the Mozambican border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary of the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecological zones, each protecting different wildlife.
This is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered the best example of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all national parks in South Africa, this park applies daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can be beneficial to purchase a 'Wild Card', which allows entry either to certain South African parks or to all South African national parks.
The name of the Hong Kong territory originated from the name of Hong Kong Island, which, moreover, is of the greatest interest to tourists.
It is reported that one of the richest people in the world, Allen, has invested a large portion of his wealth in marine exploration and has begun his search to find the war that has fascinated him all his life, Musashi.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and sail to Kowloon on the opposite shore.
Most of the urban areas on Hong Kong Island are densely developed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
The British colonizers considered this place their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest continuous mangrove area in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) towards Bangladesh and India from the coast inland.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests consist not only of mangrove swamps but also of some of the last remaining powerful jungle woodlands and shrublands that once grew in the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third consists of water/marshland.
Since 1966, animals have reigned in the Sundarbans. It is believed that about 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer now live in this area.
Buses from the district bus station (across the river) depart throughout the day, although most buses, especially those going east to Jakarta / Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Comfortable and sturdy Japanese minibuses "Coaster" travel to many districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means to reach nearby places, such as Para (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. By crossing the Oyapock River, it connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the town of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge length is 378 meters, consisting of two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be operational from September 2017, as the Brazilian border inspection posts are expected to be fully installed by then.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in the current territory of eastern Paraguay – they were semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture for sustenance.
In the Chaco region, there lived other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," emerged when Spanish conquerors encountered groups of indigenous people.
The Spaniards began a colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its native character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the Las Canitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions take place here at other times of the year.
You can find news about the matches and where to buy tickets for the polo games on the Argentine Polo Association's website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged only at the sole bank on the islands, located in "Stanley" opposite the "FIC West" store.
British pounds, including on "Stanley" credit cards, are commonly accepted everywhere on the islands; United States dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands, bank cards are probably not accepted; however, it may be possible to pay in British or United States currency. Inquire with the owners in advance about which payment method they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively harsh: the temperature is rarely negative, but due to the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no extremely wet or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals see people, nature is still wild and animals should not be fed or otherwise disturbed.
As requested by the park administration, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears or wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
Bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals, no matter how friendly they seem, can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Moreover, remember that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing fragrant food items and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the place where, in 1889, the infamous naval confrontation occurred, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed during a peaceful gathering in the city.
Because Auckland encompasses two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular are spread across three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and in many of them, you can find shade under the preserved maritime pines.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Sometimes these are crowded family beaches with many shops located on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," although it is not a complex beer, it is very mild and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta."
One can choose from many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more captivating.
It is completely safe to drink the local tap water, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the idea of coffee with milk (e.g., "flat white") is foreign. A small amount of black coffee is an espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (unwhipped) on top, and tea is without milk.
Hot chocolate that meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices, although expensive, are excellent.
The reef is visited all year round, and injuries due to any of these reasons are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, heed all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the 1770 town. They may sometimes be encountered even outside this period.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in river estuaries to the north of Rockhampton.
An advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they will have a place to stay when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodations through a travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents required in the country you are visiting (e.g., a visa).
Although any changes or requests must first be submitted to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on the festival grounds, as they believe it is an integral part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to get a campsite closer to the music.
Don't forget that even if the performances on the main stages are over, there may be places at the festival where music will play until late in the evening.
At some festivals, special campsites are set up for families with small children.
If you are sailing in the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of your cabin, as there can be a lot of noise when sailing through ice.
The cruise to St. Petersburg includes walks around the old town. Cruise passengers do not need to purchase a visa (see terms).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into ensuring that guests spend as much time as possible with them and spend as much money as possible. Most often, casinos have no clocks or windows, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and not wanting to leave.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered for free. However, intoxication impairs decision-making, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to travel in high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or below freezing temperatures.
There is little friction on roads covered with ice and snow, so it is impossible to drive as if on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, so much snow can fall in a short time that it may become impossible to move.
Visibility may be limited by falling or blowing snow, as well as foggy or icy car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are commonplace conditions in many countries, and traffic moves continuously throughout the year.
A safari is probably the most tourist-attracting and unique visitor activity in Africa.
The term "safari" is widely used to describe traveling overland to see the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, so you will be able to see them well even with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bushwalk", "trekking safari", or going "on foot") consists of a hike that can last several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the summer Olympics twice. The games were held in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might have found yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policy provisions vary, but as of the end of March, most companies do not apply coronavirus cancellation policies for July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to take place.
Ticket prices for many events are expected to range from 2500 JPY to 130,000 JPY, with standard tickets priced at around 7000 JPY.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. In many hotels, you can rent an iron and an ironing board, even if they are not available in the room.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer (if you have one).
Do not allow the fabric to become too hot (as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
Water can be purified in different ways, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it's enough to boil the water for a minute, in others, it takes a few minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies. If you are concerned about this, it would be better to purchase water in a tightly sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites that are not typical in their native region.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger an allergic reaction, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing humans by force are generally not considered pests.
Shopping at duty-free stores is an opportunity to purchase tax-free goods in certain locations.
In countries where high taxes are applied, people traveling there can sometimes save a lot, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The driving conditions on the section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont are the most challenging, as the road winds through wooded areas.
If you have not driven on the country's roads, be vigilant: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those presented in previous or subsequent sections – usually 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important.
Strangely, but the mobile connection here is much stronger than in other stretches of the road, such as "Pennsylvania Wilds."
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich in flavor and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor Austria.
Ordinary fruit pastries, which are baked with apple filling all year round, and with cherry and plum filling in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often eaten with strong coffee.
If you want to taste small but richly flavored pastries, try the baked goods that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in different regions.
A stew is a dish based on herbs and spices, as well as meat and vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the deep regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
With 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses the numerous local cuisines of the country.
But if this concept is used without additional explanation, it usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine, widely spread in the archipelago, is characterized by simple seasonal dishes, with dominant spices like peanuts, hot chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.
The stirrups support the rider's legs, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability but can raise safety concerns because the rider's foot may get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets stuck in the stirrup, they can be dragged as the horse runs. To reduce this risk, several precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have a heel and feature a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially those of the English type, have safety holders from which the stirrup leather loop slides down when a falling rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley is a major rock climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring numerous large granite walls and steep cliffs.
From the peaks, a breathtaking view opens up. Climbers from all over the world constantly create new routes because the rocks are endless.
Popular winter sports for descending hills include skiing and snowboarding, with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "skiing nomads," planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old - skiers were depicted in cave paintings as far back as 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Austria.
Ski touring: this activity is also known as skiing in remote areas or ski tourism.
It is related, but does not usually include Alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, which are done in steeper areas and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as similar to a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover a slightly longer distance than when walking, but only in very rare cases will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing, where skiing without a heavy backpack is done on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would require applying for visas multiple times and stopping at border checkpoints for passport inspection.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you will usually be able to cross borders without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, there is no need to apply for visas to each Schengen area member state – this saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are defined as antiques. Some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition varies in different locations, for example, the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items can be described as antiques, even though they are made later than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture related to trade is also significant for people in most other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi people were widely engaged in reindeer husbandry – they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and mostly used the reindeer as working animals.
Today, many Sámi are acquiring modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, a region inhabited by the Sámi.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive as it evokes associations with negative stereotypes and an inaccurate perception of what Roma people are.
If a travel warning is issued for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to check the advice from other countries' governments, not just your own, however, their advice is intended for their citizens.
As one example, it can be mentioned that American citizens in the Middle East may encounter various situations related to Europeans and Arabs.
The advice provides brief information about the political situation in the country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and greatly simplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather conditions are a general term denoting any hazardous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, disrupt social order, or result in loss of life.
Extreme weather events can be observed all over the world, and moreover, there are different types that depend on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation and fires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones are forms of bad weather and the consequences they leave behind.
More serious regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena include blizzards, winter storms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are highly recommended to familiarize themselves with any severe weather risks that may affect the area they are visiting, as the weather can have an impact on certain travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must be trained by professionals.
Entering "hostile environment courses" in an internet search will likely yield the address of a local company.
Courses usually explore all the topics discussed here in much greater detail, generally providing practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that talk about surviving in the wild are popular, but there are few publications that write about war zones.
Travelers planning a gender reassignment surgery must ensure they have the proper documents to return.
Not all governments are in favor of issuing passports with unspecified gender (X), or updating documents to reflect the desired name, surname, and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, searches at checkpoints became significantly stricter.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without violating their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the flow of water returning to the sea from breaking waves on the shore, often occurring near reefs and similar areas.
The returning current due to underwater topology concentrates in several deeper places. Here, a fast current carrying things deep can form.
The most common cause of death is due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you drift out of the current, it is harder to return than usual.
Try to head somewhere you haven't been caught before, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to reality occurs earlier than cultural shock (as if the honeymoon is over), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes particularly difficult to return to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your native cultural habits.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show for children is one of the most interesting attractions in the area.
Before the performance begins, you can see the pyramids in the darkness and silence.
Usually, you constantly hear the voices of tourists and traders. The sound and light narration is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a decoration and a storyteller of long history.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids, while different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases – in 2020, there were sixteen in operation.
The archipelago lies 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where the Villa Las Estrellas settlement is located.
The other islands are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an still active volcano forms an impressive natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is a region located in the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here into a plateau and then rise again, forming the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or the Sentinel Range, there are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its highest point at 4,892 m, Mount Vinson.
In remote areas where there is no mobile connection, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone because, in order to make a call, you need to be outside so that nothing blocks the satellite.
This service is often used in shipping, including recreational boats, and in expeditions when it is necessary to transmit data and voice.
Your local telecommunications provider should give you more information about accessing this service.
A much more popular option for those planning to take a gap year is traveling and learning.
It is especially popular among school graduates as it gives them the opportunity to take a break before university studies without compromising their education.
In many cases, completing courses abroad in the year following graduation can improve your chances of getting into a higher education institution in your home country.
Usually, to participate in this training, a certain fee must be paid.
Finland is a great place for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is not necessary.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every eight people.
The citizens of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand also keep up with this number, but in other cases, it is quite unusual (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is from 0 to 40).
Many different Baltic cruises feature a longer visit to St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means that you can visit the historic town for two days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you disembark only as an excursion ship participant, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures depict Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
A flight on an airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and social groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
One should not be ashamed of this; this fear is no different from other fears and antipathies that people experience.
For some people, knowing how an aircraft operates and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or the inability to control the situation.
Parcel delivery companies are well paid for fast delivery. Often time is extremely important when delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts in case of urgent repairs.
For certain routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes, smaller companies have encountered a problem.
When sending goods by air, unloading and customs clearance took more than one day on some routes.
The only faster way was to send the package as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where your role begins.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to lay out a significant amount of money for this privilege (or even better, if your company does it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as practice shows, you can expect to pay four times more than the usual economy class price compared to business class and even eleven times more compared to first class!
Simply put, it makes no sense to even look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers willing to pay extra for the privilege of reaching something quickly and conveniently, which is why they impose such charges.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, after this conflict, a self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic was established in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite unsuccessful political negotiations, the economic ties between these two parts of Moldova are being restored.
Eastern Orthodoxy is the main religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an extremely good transportation hub.
In ancient times it was Smyrna, now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers contrast with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, even though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.

Do not deface the environment by scribbling graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers Catalan, the majority of the residents understand this language, and virtually all inhabitants speak Spanish.
However, many signs are in Catalan because, by law, it is the first official language.

Regular metro announcements are read only in Catalan, but for unplanned stoppages, the automated system announces in various languages: Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The reputation of Parisians is such that they are egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often an incorrect stereotype, you are more likely to get along with Parisians if you act as politely as possible, as if "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will significantly help you integrate into society.
The brusque exterior of Parisians will quickly vanish if you adhere to simple politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests, primarily consisting of beeches, spruces, and firs, characterized by a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diverse microclimate, soil differences, and varying elevation, a very wide variety of plant communities can be found there.
The territory is also characterized by an exceptionally large diversity of animal and bird species.
Among many other common species, it is also possible to encounter rare animals there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
It is required that when visiting monasteries, women wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
For women who arrive unprepared, most monasteries provide cloaks, but if you bring your own cloak, especially if it is brightly colored, a monk or a nun will smile at you at the entrance.
According to the same requirements, men must wear knee-covering trousers.
They can also be borrowed from the stocks placed at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each wearing, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, consists of freshly baked bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), with olive oil used everywhere.

However, people who speak Spanish poorly may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to learn it separately.
Old observatories are usually no longer used these days and have become museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not such a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are mostly found in cities or university campuses, and they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes used for scientific research are enormous instruments located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of blooming cherry trees, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where people admired plum blossoms.
The first cherry blossom viewing parties in Japan were held by the emperor only for himself and other aristocrats close to the emperor.

There is a tradition to spend the Easter night without sleep, in some open space, welcoming the sunrise.
Of course, there are explanations of this tradition in Christian theology, but it may also be a spring and fertility ritual from pre-Christian times.
During Easter weekend, more traditional churches hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening, and congregations often begin to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance to the continent, mammals could not travel, so the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
When people arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs, were brought along.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will see the polar night when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark practically all day long.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution issues rarely arise here, you will be able to enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than is common in the West.
Suits are standard business attire, and coworkers address each other using last names or job titles.
