This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are usually not available from fossilized remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top, and either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation on the underside.
The find also allows for an examination of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs lack a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but still have other distinctive features—barbs and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis most likely appeared later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers speculated that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen features adult plumage rather than chick down.
Researchers suggested that, despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult, rather than chick down.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic field inversions.

The work conducted was mainly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way influence the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as it does with ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of the dark matter around the Galaxy is arranged in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

During research in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr. Tony Moll managed to discover tuberculosis with exceptionally high drug resistance (XDR-TB).
In the interview, he said that the new strain "is a cause for great concern because it leads to a very high mortality rate."
Some patients might have contracted the infection in the hospital, thinks Dr. Moll, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect from 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis within the entire group of tuberculosis patients still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected at this particular moment in South Africa.

In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: the voter enters a booth and places a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The laws of France regarding elections strictly systematize the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of voting and that no other envelopes are added except for those of people who were allowed to participate in the vote and whose votes were properly counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with a special procedure.

Schneider testified via video link from the USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to the competitions on Wednesday, Karpenko participated in two individual events at the championships.
Her first competition was the slalom, in the first run of which she did not reach the finish. 36 out of 116 participants had the same result in that race.
In another race, this time in giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the sitting position with a combined time of 4:41.30. This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-finishing Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-finishing Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group were unable to complete their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh state police returned the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building at the moment when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekeye with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting charges and a trial, but any witness testimonies may be distorted, as her popularity has been widely exploited by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists indeed seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other data about suspects."
The Royal Prosecution, which is generally responsible for prosecution, told reporters that no further comments would be made, at least until a guilty verdict is reached.
According to the information leak, the document will concern the dispute about the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian National Authority agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The archers participating in the additional pest control test had to be under the close supervision of rangers, as the test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Within the partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited through the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the Wildlife and National Parks Service, four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Marteyi swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth SEP of Marteia in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures for the country's move towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These protests, sometimes accompanied by violence, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people receiving minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 cases related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
In response, the ministry called the delay of the Apple report "very regrettable".
At 07:19 AM local time (21:19 GMT on Friday), an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the elderly woman's place because she stepped away to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He received education as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, in his free time he began to investigate cases of premature birth.
His study showed that if a hormone is administered, it will enhance the maturation of the baby's lungs during fetal development.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators found two flight recorders, or "black boxes."
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Here is what Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna became the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. It is already a unique event, just like she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "The moon was as crazy as I am... Maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the opinion that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
A survey showed the following: 29 percent of respondents are confident that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swims and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is now in doubt.
He could not take the medication necessary to relieve the pain, as it is banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by the beginning of February, several people had confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow airplanes to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
She uses satellite technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport has been launched to Wembley, overground trains will not stop there, and, moreover, there are no parking facilities or park-and-ride lots on the ground.
Concerns about the lack of transportation led to the suggestion that the game might have to be held behind closed doors without fans.
The description of the study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, discusses the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) with the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be shaped into any form. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into fine wire, which can be woven and plated. It can be stamped or rolled into coils.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books – the so-called "illuminated manuscript".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical substance is.
The pH level is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Obtain a new mixture by combining two dry powders in one container, and then use clean, damp hands to form a ball from this mixture.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then a kind of shell will form.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
The preserved fragments of sewage systems were discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also present in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary.
The wheel has changed our world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel did for us is to provide much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are a greater number of medium-sized cats that feed on small-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche concept, the special work that each type of cat performs, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males who are related, as well as females and cubs, whose number can reach up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs — animals that have habits surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a fully developed athlete, the tiger can climb trees (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar does not resemble the full-throated roar of a lion, but more resembles the shouting of sentences made up of indistinct words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If given the chance, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the creatures that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the trail of animals and find their prey by scent, tracking its movements on the ground with their sense of smell.
They have excellent night vision, allowing them to see in the dark and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelots stalk their prey by blending into the surroundings and then pounce on their target.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes compared to what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all — it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it starts to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Over time, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to say they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, that is, the emergence of new species. Speciation is an obligatory consequence and an extremely essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants are nourished by the sun through photosynthesis. Moreover, they cast shadows.
We build our houses and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the most formidable predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 of the sharpest teeth, and there was an additional row on the palate, so there was no escape for those who crossed his path.
We do not know for certain, but it is not ruled out that his tongue was split. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus would not compare to him.
Despite the fact that most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts. For example, boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent known as dormouse.
There was another difference: while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich liked to hold joint feasts during which they ate lying on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include products that came to Europe from America or Asia in the subsequent centuries.
In particular, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main sanctuary for each of the gods, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the wishes of the gods during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes as elements of the temple, special towers in the form of pyramids called "ziggurats" were constructed.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not of particular importance.
Much of the life of a Jewish family took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were open stalls facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas narrate that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there was a treasure map depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it is written: "The original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for more convenient storage.
Thus, it is quite likely that the entry was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation "Neptune" and the subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south still was not.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These French made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Free French forces and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture, whose carriers are a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil" and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also in a certain way expresses the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, continuous cultural presence, and acceptable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the United States War of Independence, the thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, the only body of which was Congress.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
To make amendments, according to the articles, unanimous approval from all the states is required, but the states have been so irresponsible towards the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its belonging to a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan dates back many years, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating the transformation of indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for static photographs is 35 mm, and this size was the dominant film size at the twilight of the analog era.
Today it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sizes of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat misleading; it has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore accepted as 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or closely approximate these proportions.
The too often used and frequently mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was the object of close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervasive power touched everyone - from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of church authority was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to doubt whether this dogma was being adhered to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws as outlined in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
As the response to this tactic was muted, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare actions.
Among the majority of citizens and peoples in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique method was used to denote periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family was a special dynasty.
Additionally, between the reigns of each dynasty, there was fragmentation and instability. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce military actions took place among many noble people fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many such social and political effects as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than a sole ruler.
After the Revolution, job opportunities also became available to all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, as ranks started to be based on qualities rather than on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in subjects not related to worldly life. He often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for reflection.
Well, the cave that has been preserved to this day gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located at the top of the mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find even for someone who knows of its existence. In the cave, a person is completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except for the clear beautiful sky above and the multitude of surrounding mountains. From deep within the cave, one can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was erected by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and his relatives.
The symbol for an up-bow looks like a V, and the symbol for a down-bow looks like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
"Up" means that you should start from the tip and move the bow forward, while "down" means that you should start from where your hand holds the bow and move it back.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can draw your own hatching, but remember that hatching is printed for musical reasons and is usually worth following.
On October 6, 1789, an angry crowd of women from the market forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Madame Élisabeth to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd of people made the King and Queen open the windows wide.
At some point, a member of this crowd waved the head of a royal guardsman, killed at Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bond loans floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted them to establish the order.
The era during which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages succeeded the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted viewpoint, ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict viewpoint that the destinies of people are driven by the fundamental logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is almost immune to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by their own properties, rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause for the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically disadvantageous only for a small group of vehicles, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of road accidents, which results in the invention of new methods of treating injuries in healthcare.
Romanticism largely included cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture associated with it emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital during the times of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury spread around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because the crusaders returned with such gifts as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that moment, the title of the Fashion Capital transitioned from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25-30 years.
Distinctive styles began to develop in Western Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is conducted to produce a sufficient amount of food to meet the needs of just the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture that uses seeds from plants native to the ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in agriculture for subsistence purposes, and this is still observed in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards and allow such people to define for themselves who they are.
Differences between subcultures are possible, determined by age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and/or gender of the people who comprise them.
Characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a certain subculture often declare their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the illustration of several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, did not have contact with adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents). In some cases, such abandonment of their child was a result of the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is completely raised by animals instead of people, a feral child exhibits habits (within physical limitations) that are almost entirely similar to those of the specific animal that raised him — for instance, his fear or indifference toward people.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more interesting, scaffolding surpasses many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather a form of assistance for those undergoing new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding to aid learning is built into the software and designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that might be too difficult for the learner to handle alone.
Children are placed under guardianship for a variety of reasons, ranging from homelessness to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where upbringing, care, and education are not provided, but they do.
We consider the foster care system to be safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communications.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of the approach to use and satisfaction.
Thus, the idea was expressed that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contacts" were also identified by Eimmy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions — facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In the article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage can nonetheless accurately assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his assumption, animals, such as domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research conducted in the twentieth century showed that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like that of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do this will lead to serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates such as us unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking into account all of the above, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include consuming large amounts of liquids (particularly water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present within you. Every person is potentially given the ability to achieve absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) in Kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is considered the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, contradictions regarding the system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was destined to last for the next 40 years. Real battles were fought in it, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been breached, and the only hope was withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete practically overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the capture of the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to carry large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The work of sailors traditionally involves ensuring the nation's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the company in the North Atlantic during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did the other European countries.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to have milk, wool, meat, and hides readily available.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often supervised by goat herders, who were typically children or teenagers, similar to the more common activity of shepherding. These grazing methods are still used today.
Roads for carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although cart roads were merely parallel laid bars of wood, they allowed horses to transport larger loads over them and at higher speeds than over the slightly more bumpy roads of that time.
Sleepers began to be used quite a long time ago to hold the rails in place. However, it later became clear that tracks were more effective with an iron strip on top.
It became common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transport was walking on foot; people began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
For their Australopithecus ancestors, bipedalism was not so familiar.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of australopithecines from the era of 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living by caring more about the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement and can even be activists to somewhat alleviate future suffering.
As a rule, it is similar to treating symptoms. If we need more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly under the influence of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles, issues have become more extensive.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
150–200 copies were produced overnight, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of this document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read in front of his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known at present are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not reached us.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived on to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But much more can be said about birds, which still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs with claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" or "bits" if using computer jargon.
It can be difficult to immediately detect oral poisoning. Symptoms like vomiting are too common for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medicine or a toxic household chemical substance.
Refer to the label for special instructions on first aid treatment for poisoning with this specific toxin.
The term "bug" is formally used by entomologists to refer to a group of insects.
This concept originates from the anciently known bed bugs – insects excellently adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are nidicolous species adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been identified in the United States, making multiple sclerosis the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which comprises the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that twice as many women suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not align with their interests or the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world is organized by applying the scientific method. This method actually underlies most scientific research.
He, however, is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
In all scientific matters, including psychology, the views of Aristotle were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often significantly depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their regulation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms not merely reacting to external periodic stimuli have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue their autonomous cycles over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first propositions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into a bacterium using phages, i.e., viruses.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a large variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is of interest to those who love to go into the countryside to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation on the property include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example can be visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their workplaces, while those whose workplace is in the place they just left drive past them.
In this active traffic movement, everyone is in some way connected to the transport system based on personal cars and supports it.
Currently, science indicates that the massive hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you can rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, and why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of traffic flow research.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the intensity of traffic because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematic nature and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily escape predators, find food, and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more hiding places where they can conceal themselves from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many believed he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a reasonable idea because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its width sometimes reaching six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of small rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids in Giza were never surpassed.
In the new kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years earlier.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also suggested that they transition into a new state to produce what we observe.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Such elements as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It is sad that when new methods of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and began to be used less.
People now write messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a pencil sharpener.
One can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard with the emergence of newer technologies.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that in order for many protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus, energy is required.
It's somewhat like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, the subsequent nuclear fission releases part of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to decay with little or no provocation.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what motivates people to take action or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate inside during the process of growing up.
These theories address what makes certain people want to do what they do, and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs" and "Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation".
As a rule, two types of behavior can manifest when managers begin to lead people who were previously equal to them in status. One extreme of the spectrum is the attempt to remain a "buddy" or "one of the guys" (or "girls").
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary measures, evaluate performance, distribute responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything the team has done and claim it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the other team members.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The invisible team" is a team of leaders to whom every participant reports. The invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why do organizations go through the labor-intensive process of creating a learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all functional divisions of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the cohesive work of the organization aimed at overcoming obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the client's interests.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience accumulation.
Angel (2006) explains the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
The data from neurobiology provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying consciousness. This narrows the area of research, making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes of the brain.
This provides us with a large volume of data and materials for creating simulation models that help understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important field of computer science that considers the behavior and learning of machines and the "implantation" of intelligence in them.
Research in the field of AI includes creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be given: control, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and client inquiries, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
Such issues have been highlighted in separate disciplines, whose aim is to solve the tasks we encounter in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Educational field trips are very important for any class. Very often, teachers want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Posting a tour in virtual space for public viewing is also a great way to refresh the memory of the tour and share the acquired knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and each year this website is updated, but access to old versions is still preserved—they serve as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this typically changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive for perfection in their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Additionally, by maintaining a blog, "students begin to better understand the world around them." Students are inspired to be intelligent and interesting, capturing the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration, and it motivates students to extend the process of acquiring knowledge far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can provide students with the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of others' work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada with a vast number of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are practically uninhabited wilderness.
An astonishing population comparison: there are more African Americans in the USA than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than others and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as chic beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, and it particularly took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all female tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they might feel like they are being harassed, as women are often followed, grabbed by the hand, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city called Ad-Dar al-Bayda, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole assortment of various trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is quite a safe place, it is advisable to check information in advance regarding any trips outside of Goma to understand the current state of hostilities taking place in the North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and it is a place where you can see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the lowest prices in Africa.
You can get to Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic faraway land.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to threats from the desert sands.
While filming Henry Louis Gates' program "Wonders of the African World" on PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it predominantly features an Arab flavor rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River serving as its southern boundary.
The area of the park is 19,500 km²; it includes 14 different ecozones, each of which serves as a habitat for various wild animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered a leading one among South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for protection and visiting this park.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit either select or all national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider the main focus of their attention.
The row of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a gleaming bar chart accentuated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Kowloon Peninsula, which is located opposite.
The largest part of the urban development areas on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, extending from the coast 80 km (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps — they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about a third of which is made up of water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and according to available estimates, it is currently home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are serviced by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
A minibus is a fast and convenient way to reach nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, while the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two traffic lanes, each 3.5 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to various groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously referred to as the "vast province of the East Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and also the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Less major tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To find out news about polo matches and where to buy tickets for them, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency might be; clarify in advance with the owners which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside their territory, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. During the summer months, air temperatures above +30°C are a common occurrence.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and air humidity creates a feeling of colder weather compared to what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves closer than 100 yards/meters, and all other wild animals closer than 25 yards/meters!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they do not maintain the necessary distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please respect their personal space.
Furthermore, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying pungent food with you, and also maintain cleanliness in the camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 residents.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German sailors died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here because Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded by trees such as the pohutukawa.
In the central district of Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers are located in the Waitemata Harbour, the Tamaki Drive beaches are spread out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The most popular local beer is "Number One"; it has an uncomplicated, pleasant, and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that can be drunk, however, New Zealand and Australian wines may transport better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, it is not difficult to find bottled water.
Australians are puzzled by the idea of a "flat white." A "small black" is an espresso, they serve cappuccino with a tall layer of whipped cream (not with froth), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
A large number of trips are made to the reef all year round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. Occasionally, they can be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their main habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler not to worry about where to stay upon arrival at the destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages that include flights and hotel accommodation.
In addition, they can hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the overwhelming majority of participants spend the night right on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may already be over, there can be areas at the festival where music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as traveling through the ice results in rather eerie noise that can disturb sleep for the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (confirm conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to ensure that visitors spend as much time and money as possible at the establishment. There are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests remain in a good mood and do not leave the establishment.
In some establishments, free alcohol is offered. However, intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who is planning to travel through high-latitude areas or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you will not be able to drive in the same way as on regular asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, blizzards, condensation, or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues year-round almost without interruptions.
A safari is probably the biggest attraction for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday use means a land trip to see the remarkable wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so it's possible to get a good view even with regular equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you will see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush exploration," "hiking safari," or "walking tour") consists of a trek lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice. They were first held here in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the date change was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020 when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer an iron and ironing board for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy or you're not thrilled with the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to too high a temperature (which can lead to shrinkage or, in very rare cases, to burns).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for one minute, while in others, it will take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pest animals they have not seen in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, even worse, trigger allergic reactions, secrete poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can cause harm or lead to human death, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods at specific locations without taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount, especially on goods such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backwoods and forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: they are dominated by steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limits set are noticeably lower than on the preceding and subsequent sections—usually 35-40 miles/h (56-64 km/h)—and strictly adhering to them is even more important than anything else.
However, strangely enough, the mobile phone reception here is much better than in many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery pastries are quite good. In Bavaria, they are quite plentiful and varied, and similar to the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apple pastries available year-round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer.
German pastries often use almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often perfectly paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small yet satisfying pastry treats, try what, depending on the region, are called "oladyas" or filled doughnuts.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is actively used in curry. In Southern India and certain coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to describe the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without clarifications, this term most often refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese give the greatest preference to flavoring additives such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are foot supports for a rider, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there can be safety issues as there is a chance of the foot getting stuck.
If a horse throws off its rider, but his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, the running horse may drag him along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel that have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, certain saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with safety bars, thanks to which the leather stirrup slips off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley is the main destination for climbing in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of big granite walls and rocks.
At the top, one can enjoy breathtaking mountain views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its enormous potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Alpine skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (sometimes referred to as "ski bums") who plan their vacation entirely around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to as early as 5000 BC!
The sport of skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism is also called backcountry, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related, but usually does not include hiking to the top and then descending on unprepared slopes, as skiing in fresh powder requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine that the ski route is a walking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than when traveling on foot, but such speeds on cross-country skis can only be achieved in extremely rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and there is a prepared ski track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean the need to apply for visas and go through passport control multiple times.
But the Schengen Area in this regard functions as a single country.
While in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Agreement member countries separately, which will save you time and money, as well as avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, in which the age limit in places like North America can be lower than in Europe.
Handcrafted items can be classified as antiques, even though they are younger in age than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also significant for many other professions.
Although this is the tradition, not all representatives of the Sami people were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived by fishing, hunting, and other similar trades, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi are engaged in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to travel advisories with warnings about potential dangers, it may affect your travel medical insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult with other governments besides your own, but their recommendations are aimed at their citizens.
Here is an example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations that Europeans or Arabs may not face.
The information reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information widely available.
Adverse weather conditions is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social upheaval, or leading to human casualties.
Adverse weather conditions occur everywhere around the world, and they come in various forms, depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather phenomena such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to consider any risks associated with severe weather in their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An internet search for the phrase "hostile environment safety course" may turn up an address for a local company.
The course usually explores all the topics touched upon here in much greater detail, often with practical training.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing situations, a large amount of information on first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines that talk about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue passports without gender (X) or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies in different places.
The readiness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents is also quite varied.
Screenings at checkpoints also became much more thorough after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals preparing for surgery should not expect that they will be able to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
A rip current is a flow created by waves breaking against the shore, or sometimes against a reef or something similar.
The reverse flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where a fast current going to greater depths can form due to the similar underwater topology.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try to go where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to one's home country occurs sooner than culture shock (the romantic period is shorter here), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were most likely patient and understanding towards you, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People might find it unexpected that patience and understanding also need to be shown to travelers returning home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in this area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the show begins.
The noise from tourists and vendors is usually always heard. The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries claim the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819. These islands have the most bases, and in 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named King George with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of the active volcano up to the present time forms an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, then rise again and form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth mountain system, divided into two parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, namely on the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica—the Vinson Massif, the highest point of which reaches 4,892 meters and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote areas outside of mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to be outdoors in the line of sight with the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used in shipping, including recreational and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transmission and voice communication.
As a rule, you can obtain additional information about connecting this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take an academic year is to travel and study.
It is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before entering university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during an academic leave can significantly improve your chances of getting admitted to higher education institutions in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for admission to such educational programs.
Finland is an excellent place for boat tourism. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
Exploring the archipelagos or visiting the lakes, you can easily manage without a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide completely different impressions.
Boating is a national form of leisure in Finland. In particular, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
A similar situation exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other cases, it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this value ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stopover in Russia's St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historic city, while returning to the ship to spend the nights.
If you go ashore only as part of a shore excursion from the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
A plane journey can be intimidating for a person of any age and social status, especially if it is their first flight ever or if they have had any traumatic event in the past.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is no different from personal aversion and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for speedy delivery execution. Often, the speed of delivering commercial documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On certain routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this has been a problem.
If they were to send anything as air freight, on some routes the unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to deal with it faster is to send it as checked luggage. The airline regulations do not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, so your involvement is needed here.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to splurge on this privilege (or better yet, get your company to pay for you).
However, it is not cheap at all — based on experience, roughly approximating, you will pay four times more than regular economy class for business and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, it makes no sense to even look for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a substantial amount for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, which is why they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that fell victim to an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million people, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna today is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers alternate with places with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques, and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and there is also an unusual octagonal church located there.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It is worth spending half an hour and taking a walk through the unusual village.
Comparatively not far to the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, celebrated by Lord Byron, which subsequently gained worldwide fame.
The Scotturb bus № 403 makes regular trips to Sintra and stops at Cape Roca.
Further north, also visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fátima (mausoleum) — the site of the world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially at the site of a mass grave, as well as a place that is indescribably important to a significant percentage of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death, be they Jewish or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not desecrate this place by painting or scratching graffiti on the objects around.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are indicated only in Catalan, since it is, by law, the first official language.
Nevertheless, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are reputed to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave impeccably, like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This will significantly ease your adaptation in this city.
The aloof exterior of Parisians will immediately vanish if you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and represents a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the combination of microclimates, different soils, and altitude variations, it features an especially wide diversity of plant communities.
The area abounds with a huge variety of different species of animals and birds.
Here you can encounter rare representatives of the fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie, as well as many other common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and have their shoulders covered.
In most monasteries, they provide clothing for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also take them at the entrance, but this clothing is not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable in these skirts. One size fits all for men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), with the widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for lunch, especially in the summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available topping, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning You, are always capitalized even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and complements.
It also likely simplifies reading, while writing becomes somewhat more complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One should be especially careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, don't forget that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "expensive" and carro means "cart".
The Persian language has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this Persian grammar textbook will help you learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
Obviously, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and that it is not necessary to learn it separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered outdated today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not as much of an issue as it is today, they are typically located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are large structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossom, called "hanami", became part of Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
This idea came from China, where the plum color was a favorite flower.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom were arranged by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so don't be tempted to take even one specimen.
When visiting an officially organized garden, collecting "samples" will also lead to you being expelled without any discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, easy to navigate, and almost everything can be bought upon arrival.
But, finding yourself in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (when the sky is cloudless, which is less often).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the legendary burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are going to board is heading to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for holding some sort of celebration.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to see the sights of the Danube, or traveling by boat on the Erie Canal.
They also determine paths for popular pedestrian and bicycle routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and those not belonging to Christianity around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night without going to sleep, in some open place, to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it can just as well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter service on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with parishioners typically starting the celebration of the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands got here by swimming, flying, or being carried by the current.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to reach there, which makes the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galápagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience what the polar night is like, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and consequently, light pollution is often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Western people are accustomed to.
Suits are the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or position.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of group work are valued more highly than individual achievements.
Employees usually need to get permission from their supervisor before making any decisions and are obliged to comply unconditionally with the supervisor's orders.
