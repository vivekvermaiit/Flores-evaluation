It not only confirms the already widely spread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangements, which are usually not detectable from distant fossils.
Scientists say that the upper part of this animal's feathers is chestnut-brown, while the lower part is buff or carotenoid colored.
This finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Researchers concluded that dinosaurs lacked a well-developed calamus in their feathers, but that they had hairs and barbules with other feather characteristics, suggesting that the calamus evolved later than these other features.
The structure of feathers suggests that they are used for regulating temperature or display rather than flight. Researchers argued that, despite it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feather of an adult rather than a chick.
Despite researchers considering that this was the tail of a young dinosaur, they suggested that the sample showed the feathers of an adult rather than a chick.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech process: voters enter the booth alone to place a printed paper list showing their chosen candidates into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. Votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with established procedures.

Hyun retired from his job and member of parliament Ed Davey will take his place in the Cabinet of Ministers. Member of parliament Norman Lamb is expected to take over the position of Business Minister vacated by Davey.
Hyn and Price will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nikolas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving.
Edgar Wegilya was injured in his arm and chin, while Kristoffer Schneider had to undergo reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's weapon did not move when aimed at the fifth person's head. Snyder has ongoing pain, one eye became blind, and the missing part of his skull and face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave instructions via video link from the USAF base in his country.
Besides the competition on Wednesday, Karpanedo competed in two singles competitions in the championship.
He first competed in the slalom and received a "did not finish" note in the first run. In that race, 36 out of 116 athletes achieved that result.
In the other competition, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Lösch, who took first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who placed ninth.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers could not complete their runs, and out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom, 45 failed to finish the competition.
The police department of Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arýa said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused individuals are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused were brought to court with their faces covered.
When the car crashed, although there were three people inside the house, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, the emergency rescue service extricated the driver from the red "Audi TT" car.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in the town of Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoýa has been accused of killing her own son and has since been held at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is being detained in custody awaiting trial on charges, but any evidence from witnesses might be questionable because his picture has been widely published.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
According to professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee, "perhaps, by publishing photos of the suspects and so on, journalists are treading a dangerous line."
The directorate of crowns, which bears general responsibility for court proceedings, told journalists that no further comments would be made until at least a charge is filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders that aim to restore Palestine to its pre-1967 Middle East war status.
According to reports, the other topics mentioned include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands to maintain its military presence in the valley for ten years after signing the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep that presence for only five years.
Rangers must closely monitor the shooters who were given an additional trial period for combating pests, because the trial period was supervised and its effectiveness was evaluated.
The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) collaborated, and qualified volunteers were recruited according to the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily performing the duties of Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service of Australia, the four shooters chosen for the initial shooting operation received extensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelli inaugurated the nine new members of the Interim Electoral Council (CEP).
He is Martelli's fifth CEO in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission advised the former CEP council to resign as part of the measures to lead the country to new elections.
It was a commission in response to Martelli's extensive protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes the protests that use violence are caused by the failure to hold overdue elections since 2011.
It was reported that nearly 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have occurred, which caused a total of six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it has information on 27 incidents related to those devices.
Last week, METI reported another 34 overheating incidents of Apple's devices, stating that the company called them "not serious."
The ministry responded by saying that it is "truly regrettable" for the Apple company to postpone the announcement.
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT, Friday).
The Directorate of Emergency Situations of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage had occurred within the country's territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
In the capital of the Philippines, the city of Manila, a former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with an M16 automatic rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and it has been confirmed that at least six hostages have died so far.
Until that time, six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were released.
The photographers replaced the old woman who later had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
After studying obstetrics, he/she started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth when he had spare time.
His research showed that releasing the hormone would speed up the development of the baby's fetal lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two flight recorders known as "black boxes" on Wednesday.
The wrestler companions also expressed condolences to Luna.
"Luna Ekstrem was the first queen. She was my first manager. She passed away on a night of two moons. Very unique just like herself. She was a strong woman," said Tommy Drimer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was strange like me, maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she will be in a better place."
The number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of survey participants share the opinion that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the most extreme ends of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Union's games, but doubts arise due to complaints about their physical fitness.
He was unable to take the necessary medicines to overcome his pain because they are banned in the Games.
On January 25, Kurtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer sciences at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery with various devices and software by the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Because comets have occasionally collided with Earth, scientists hope to understand how planets have formed, especially how Earth was formed.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his position as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He called those rumors "political noise and stupidity."
There are rumors that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the "NextGen" system is a system that allows airplanes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It allows using satellite-based technology instead of old ground-based technology to guide air traffic controllers more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport operations at Wembley and surface trains will not stop, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the surface.
Concerns about a shortage of transportation increased the possibility that the game might be held behind closed doors without the participation of the team's fans.
A scientific study published Thursday in the journal "Science" reported the emergence of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Although it is believed that this process usually takes longer, researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species, which evolved in just two generations, has emerged due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of forms. It can be rolled and turned into tiny shapes.
It can be turned into a thin wire that can be bent and twisted. It can also be hammered or turned into sheets.
It can also be thinned and applied to the surface of another metal. It can be thinned so much that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH indicator of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have shed their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry ingredients together, then squeeze them with clean, moist hands to form a ball.
The moisture in your hand will interact with its outer layers, becoming pleasant and forming a unique crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also restrooms. In Roman civilization, restrooms were sometimes a part of public baths where men and women would go together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you utilize a satellite.
It receives the signal from the satellite in space and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
To place a satellite or a telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The bicycle has transformed the world in unimaginable ways. The greatest thing the bicycle has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many cats (including domesticated house cats) that eat a variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success is about the concept of place, which is a special task that keeps each cat from competing with others.
Tigers are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of adult male kin from one to three years old, and mothers and children up to thirty.
Mothers often form large families composed of close relatives, sisters, and daughters.
Tiger groups act like packs of wolves or dogs, the nature of those animals is astonishingly similar to that of tigers (but not like other big cats), and they are particularly deadly to their prey.
A flesh-and-blood athlete, the tiger can climb (though not exceptionally well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same group (genus Panthera). These four cats are the only cats that can roar.
The roar of a leopard is more akin to a sentence composed of gruff, shouting words than to the way a tiger growls.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate the animals they are going to eat by sniffing and tracking the areas they have roamed.
They see very well in the dark through nighttime vision and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the environment and pouncing on it unexpectedly.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from their main population (for instance, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by migrating to a new island from which it's not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In that new environment, there are various resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than the previous ones.
The initial population hasn't changed at all, yet they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to resemble the previous population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, those two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We simply refer to this process, which signifies the emergence of a new species, as speciation. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and is a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the Sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its era, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
It had about 70 knife-like sharp teeth in its long jaw, and another set of teeth was located in its palate, which meant that nothing it encountered could escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue. It ate squid, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have practiced cannibalism.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like a tyrannosaurus could not compete with it.
Even if we are familiar with most of their foods, the Romans had their share in feasts with strange or unusual, including wild ass, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on a chair, wealthy men enjoyed holding a feast together and eating while reclining on their elbows.
Ancient Roman dishes did not contain food products that later centuries would bring to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman even tasted Indian chicken.
The Babylonians built a main temple, considered to be the house of the god, for each of their gods.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strove to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Occasionally, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built within the structures of temples.
A special sanctuary for God is located at the top of the minaret.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house has not been particularly important.
Most of the Ivrit family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked food in the yard; the shops were open shelves facing the street. Stones were used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Kengan, so wood was exceedingly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In Scandinavian sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further to the west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living here at that time.
Even though each country is "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the populations, kings, traditions, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the film "National Treasure," you might think there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July, 1776." This text appears upside down at the very bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document was rolled up to be stored early in its life (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches).
Therefore, perhaps, it was added as just a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy" regime. Instead of fighting against the occupiers, they collaborated with the Germans by reaching an agreement in 1940.
On August 15, 1940, the allies invaded southern France, and this invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a society, which is a significantly large group of people living and working together.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "citizenship," and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and to some extent defines the scope of society.
City-states are the founders of nations. Civilization envisions the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the long-term preservation of cultural footprints, and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures frequently disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government with a single component, the Congress, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and because it lacked a national executive or judiciary, it often had to rely on state authorities, who were frequently unwilling to cooperate, to ensure the enforcement of its decisions.
He also had no authority to abolish the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
It required unanimous agreement from all states to amend the articles, and the states were so indifferent to the central government that their representatives often were not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered one of the most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Famous sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians participate in international games and the Olympic competitions.
Japan, with around 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), is the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands existing in Japan, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical standpoint.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, began changing the local grain production methods, and recruited Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's (1644-1912) troops occupied the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby granting Japan the authority to rule over Taiwan, which it then governed until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of what they were originally like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which became the dominant film at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Actually, somewhat surprisingly, the width of the 35 mm format is 36 mm and the height is 24 mm.
For that reason, this format's aspect ratio is said to be 3:2 (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer).
Most widespread formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to that aspect ratio.
The widely misused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guide that creates dynamism while maintaining the standard measure of order.
It is said that the most impactful spot for the main object in it is the intersection of the lines that divide the picture vertically and horizontally into three parts (see the example).
During that period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthier and more powerful, was scrutinized closely.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held together the nations of Europe, despite their different languages and customs.
His profound strength affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian traditions is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and for that very reason, the church's financial resources exist.
The central authority of the Vatican was located in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money in one place has raised doubts among many people about the observance of this principle.
Shortly after the military actions began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
Although this blockade violates international law, which is commonly recognized and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries, it has proven to be an effective strategy, preventing significant military and civilian supplies.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, posing a threat even to neutral vessels.
Because this tactic received limited retaliation, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant views of citizens and most countries were about pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, countries wanted to avoid similar situations in the future.
Tesla immigrated to the United States in 1884 to accept a job offer from the "Edison" company in New York.
When he came to the USA, he had 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique method of indicating different eras; each stage of China's development or every family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Each dynasty has had unstable periods divided into provinces. The most famous of those periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Sui dynasties.
During those periods, fierce battles took place among the nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, where thousands of people lost their lives to occupy the highest position in the grand palace of Sian.
The use of the metric system, transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not to a single ruler but to the people, are among many social and political influences.
Additionally, after the Revolution, professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and capable individuals to advance.
Some people go into military service because the class-based military ranks are now based on skill.
The French Revolution also inspired many people from the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammet has been deeply interested in issues beyond the realm of this worldly life. For contemplation, he often went to the cave known as "Hira" on the "Nur" (light) mountain.
The cave, which has survived the test of time, itself vividly portrays the aspects that Muhammad aspired to spiritually.
The cave located on one of the mountains north of Mecca was completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, he doesn't make it easy to find for someone who knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, it becomes completely secluded there.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and the mountains surrounding it like guards are visible. Inside the cave, very little of anything related to the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many large pyramid structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead consists of several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The violin's "upper bout" is marked by the letter V, while the "lower bout" resembles the lower part of an arc or a square.
Upper means you need to push the bow from the end, while lower means you need to pull the bow starting from the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow).
The upper fiddle usually produces a softer sound, while the lower fiddle is stronger and more vigorous.
Write your numbers confidently with a pen, but don't forget that printed score numbers have musical significance, therefore they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister Madame Élisabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789.
They set off back to Paris in the carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At some moment, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guardsman killed at Versailles before the distraught queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes for the colonial regime of the USA, as well as the interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street bank buildings, to cover the large portion of the expenses.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-standing exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must comprehend the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era during which the events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (the years 1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages, there were the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological impetus and technological imperative to the strong belief that human destiny is determined based on the fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
The predominant explanation of technological determinism shares two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that largely exceeds the bounds of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are not socially conditioned but rather inherent.
For example, it is possible to say that the automobile inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to build a road network across the entire country for a small number of cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new methods for health care to treat injured bodies.
In Romanticism, there was a large element of cultural determinism drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, which were more harmonious with the role of society and better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was also regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued approximately until 1100 A.D.
Primarily, in the twelfth century, its status declined due to the participants of the Crusades returning with gifts like silk and aromatic herbs, which were more precious than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at that time that the title of the fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the greatest advancements of that time, people started using buttons to fasten their garments as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds specific to the ecosystem in conjunction with other somewhat simple methods of crop rotation or maximizing yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms and provide them with an opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnic affiliation, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to showcase the situation of several unfortunate children who remained unsocialized through neglect, lack of care, or intentional cruel treatment by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (often their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child in this way was due to the parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or running away, these children may have been subject to serious child abuse or trauma.
It is claimed that some have been domesticated by humans; it is said that some lived independently in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals rather than humans, a feral child (within physical limitations) usually exhibits traits similar to the behavior of the specific animal caregiver, such as fearing humans or ignoring them altogether.
If project-based learning makes it easier and more interesting, it goes one step further than imagination.
It is support offered to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as utilizing a new computer program or starting a new project, rather than a traditional learning method.
Chairs can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of a chair, and Microsoft Office is like a tiny paperclip man.
Virtual images are installed in the software, and they are intended to ask questions, guide, and explain procedures that may be difficult for a student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in protective care for various reasons, starting from neglect, to being abused, or even being intimidated and exploited.
No child should grow up in non-educational, unkind, and unknowledgeable conditions, yet they do.
We consider the protective care system as a safe place for those children.
Our protective care system should provide safe homes, caring guardians, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Protective care must provide all the necessities that were lacking in their previously taken home.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of usage and enjoyment approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are promoted as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
The aspects of motivation such as “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998), who examined audience reactions to websites.
Using video recordings has led to significant breakthroughs in explaining micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is suggested that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying or not by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sachs demonstrated that people who cannot comprehend spoken words due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
The letter suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior might also exist in animals like domestic dogs.
A study conducted in the twentieth century showed the existence of two pools of genetic diversification: hidden and visible.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of apparent variation.
Segregation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources in the savanna.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant sources are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest if not cooked.
On the contrary, not only are animal products (ants, termites, eggs) easy to digest, but they also provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering all things, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a manner similar to how chimpanzees do on the savanna today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of deliberately waking up during your regular sleep time and going back to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
It is possible to accomplish it easily by using a slightly calm alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you are aware of resetting the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics) before sleep, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace present in a person is inversely related to the tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing vitality becomes. Every person has the potential for absolute tranquility and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they have been expanded through the Mahayana path of compassion and several Indian yoga practices.
Actually, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, system, process, and cultural clashes led to the distancing of the countries.
The war ended, and two years later, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and was fought in real form among proxy armies in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places before reaching Asia from Africa.
Until September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat with the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
However, those plans were thwarted overnight due to the creation of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts when approximately 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Utilizing ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient method for moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The mission of the naval forces traditionally consists of ensuring your country's ability to transport its people and goods, as well as hindering your enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was attempting to stop this movement, primarily using submarines.

Perhaps, goats were domesticated for the first time approximately 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as an easy source of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Goats were generally kept in herds that roamed in the mountains or other pastures, and the herds were often tended by young goat herders, who resembled widely recognized shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Carriageways were first constructed in England in the 16th century.
Although the railroads consisted merely of parallel wooden beams, compared to the somewhat rugged roads of that time, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads.
Crossbars were introduced very early to keep the rails in place. However, it gradually became evident that laying an iron strip on the rails would make them more efficient.
It became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of carts.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron rails were put into use.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, and people began to walk upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man) two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the "Australopithecus," did not walk upright habitually.
Specializations for bipedalism are found in the fossils of "Australopithecus" from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, but "Sahelanthropus" may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to somewhat reduce future hardship.
In many cases, it resembles symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we must find the roots of the problems and eliminate them.
It is evident that due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, the world has changed dramatically, and the issues are further exacerbated by the excessive growth of the population and the wasteful lifestyle of mankind.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap beyond several buildings.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, currently referred to as the "Dunlap lists."
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
There are still known to be 25 Dunlap list documents which are the oldest surviving copies. The original handwritten version has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, still there are many features in birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have clawed and toenail-like feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Nowadays, almost all computers in use are based on the manipulation of data encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are so general that it’s difficult to diagnose right away.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label on which specific first aid instructions for that particular poison are written.
The term "möjejik" is officially used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This concept comes from the recognition of cockroaches, insects highly adapted to living on people, since ancient times.
Both killer ticks and honey bees are parasitic creatures that have adapted to live in their nest or on their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, and it is the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their own interest or in the interest of the child.
Those men and women can choose a childhood adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, a biological parent terminates their parental rights to allow another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides many scientific investigations.
However, he is not alone, conducting experiments and asking experimental questions, as well as making observations, is a test used in eliminating one or several hypotheses, and also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, particularly, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often crucially linked to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through a biological clock.
However, many endogenous rhythms that do not respond to external periodic signals have been documented in various living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue their cycle periods even in the absence of external signals.
Despite everything, Cheys' experiment became one of the pioneering hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
In everything, Chavez used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments by labeling either the DNA in the phages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material segment, as well as whether the affected cells are germ cells or not, mutations can have a wide variety of different effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, but mutations in other locations can cause the cell to die or lead to cancer.
Nature-based tourism landscapes attract people who are interested in visiting natural places to enjoy observing plants and animals.
Activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting orangutans in Borneo, photographing them, and learning about them.
Every day in the morning, people drive out from small towns to go to their workplaces, while others whose workplaces are where they just came from pass by them.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somewhat interconnected, supporting a car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this gigantic carbon economy has eliminated one of the stable conditions of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or collapsed bridges are rarely heard at a similar level.
Why do transport systems lead to such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers so incompetent? Or is something more profound happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement between two points of individual drivers and vehicles, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict a driver's behavior with 100 percent confidence.
Fortunately, drivers conduct themselves within a reasonably stable limit; thus, transport flows have a certain reasonable stability, which can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, the relationships between three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
It helps to plan, design, and operate transportation infrastructure.
Insects were the first creatures to fly. The ability to fly helped them to escape predators more easily, and also to find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings lengthwise along their bodies.
This gives them a multitude of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are butterflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people considered him a genius, but many others believed the opposite: that the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems reasonable because the Earth does not feel like it is moving, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the Earth's second longest and largest river. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Also, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although building pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none could surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical perfection in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by their ancestors' monuments, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and has the smallest population.
Vatican uses Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the daily language of the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because all of these can be found in nature in their natural form, and extracting them with simple tools is relatively straightforward.
Philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consisted of one or a combination of four elements. They are earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that these transformed into new substances, forming what we observe.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are alloys that include non-metal elements in small amounts such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Meanwhile, when the pen appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer methods of writing, the pencil has decreased in status and usage.
Now people do not go near the typewriter, they type messages on computer screens.
When something new comes out, it only remains to guess what will happen to the keyboard.
A nuclear bomb operates on the principle that gathering a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
Its crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under mountainous areas.
Due to the shell being thinner, it is possible that there is more sea water nearby. The lava rising to the surface was easier.
Content theories are focused on identifying what motivates people or what attracts them.
It argues that there are certain needs and/or desires that people internalize as they grow.
Those theories depend on what makes certain people want to do things, as well as the things around them that compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior can emerge. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "just one of the guys (or girls)."
Managers of this type face difficulties in making decisions that do not please everyone, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks they must change everything the group does and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same maturity standards as traditional teams, but there are some differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for the nearby physical team.
They often have more independence compared to ordinary team members because their teams can meet across different time zones in ways that their local leaders cannot understand.
Additionally, the existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'Invisible Team' is a leadership group to which every member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the long-term process of creating a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle of the organization can lead to a new innovative process that serves the customer's demand.
For the organization to be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research, making it more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior, as well as cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
He provides us with a lot of data and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong scent of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and smart adaptation in machines.
Conducting research in artificial intelligence includes creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and graphing, the ability to respond to client inquiries and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have evolved into specific scientific fields that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Because artificial intelligence systems are now integrated into several software programs of home computers and video games, they are frequently used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military sectors.
Field trips are an important part of any lesson. The teacher often likes to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers the solution of virtual field trips. Students can observe museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy art from their seats in the classroom.
Moreover, virtually sharing field trips is a great way to think about and share experiences of the trip with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina make a website every year about their trip to the state capital. This website is redesigned annually, but the old versions are also kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing. Although students often start their blogs with careless grammar and proper writing, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, writing blogs "forces students to better understand the world around them." The necessity to maintain the audience's interest encourages students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires working and encourages students to extend learning beyond the conventional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students are able to determine their positions in the context of others’ writings, as well as express their opinions on certain issues (Orawek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's enchanting bilingual capital, where there are numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the south, while to the north, there is the haven of the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and others turn Ontario into a place that foreigners consider typical of Canada.
The large regions located further north are sparsely populated, with some areas being almost entirely uninhabited wild lands.
In terms of population comparison, which surprises many: African Americans living in the United States are more numerous than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest and, when it comes to wildlife, is its own continent.
Most small islands are either independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxurious coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought the religion of Islam to these lands and spread it widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
With the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in the 15th century, European influence and colonialism began.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west, it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of their actual marital status, any woman is advised to say that the traveler is married.
Wearing a ring can also be beneficial (but it should not look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and being followed, held by the hand, etc., are not unusual things.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand by your words (cultural differences or not, this does not make it acceptable!).
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Darul-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who had established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for trading.
Around Old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a variety of decorative items, but they are all for tourists.
The city of Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava that emerged from the Nyiragongo volcano, burying most of the streets, primarily in the city center.
Although the city of Goma is relatively safe, it is necessary to assess and confirm the situation of the ongoing military conflict in North Kivu Province before taking a trip outside of Goma.
In addition to being a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, this city is one of the cheapest places to go on an excursion to observe mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Timbuktu, which is associated with some difficulty of reaching, began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation turns it into a beautiful tourist spot and it has an airport.
Due to the threat posed by desert sands, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger sites in 1990.
He was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates's special program about the wonders of the African world on the "PBS" channel.
This city visibly differs from the other cities in the country because it has an Arab influence more than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and stretches along the length of the border, bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting various types of wildlife.
It is considered one of South Africa's main attractions and the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all national parks of South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
Purchasing a free pass that grants access to some or all parks in South Africa can also be beneficial.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is considered the main attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a shimmering histogram clearly visible with the abundance of Victoria Harbor's waters.
To observe the most stunning views of Hong Kong, head across to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side by leaving the island.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is compressed into the reclaimed area along the northern shoreline.
This is the land that British colonizers took possession of, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within India's territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests not only consist of mangrove swamps, but also include some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3850 km2, about one-third of which are waterlogged/marshy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are convenient and durable, serve many districts.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means to reach nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapok River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapok River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two minarets reach a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters, and it has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, the expected time for the completion of Brazil's customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living as semi-nomadic hunters and engaging in subsistence farming in present-day Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was the habitat of indigenous groups like the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 14th century, Paraguay, previously referred to as "the vast province of the Indian islands," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish colonizers and local groups.
The Spaniards initiated a colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of the city of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a significant portion of its local character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Palermo.
Smaller competitions and meetings can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on where to purchase tickets for competitions and polo matches, check the "Asociacion Argentina de Polo" website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the Islands, located across from the "FIC West" store in Stanley Town.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on distant islands, but British and United States currency may be; to determine the accepted method of payment, contact the owners in advance.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is situated south of the Equator, so when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer here and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
The winter season can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, a wild animal is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile it appears, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of guests get injured because the proper distance is not maintained. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, with a population just slightly less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Gawan was the site of a disastrous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships except for a British cruiser sank. About 200 Americans and Germans perished.
The peaceful gathering in the city during the independence struggle organized by this movement resulted in the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because it borders two harbors, Oakland has many beaches. The most famous of them are located in three places.
The beaches on the northern shore (in the Nort-Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean coast and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy, safe beaches for swimming, mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki-Drive beaches are located in the luxury suburban area of Mission Bay on the Waitemata Harbor and in St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches lined with a variety of shops, sometimes becoming crowded. It is safe to swim here.
The main local beer is "First Number", it is not complicated, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may go better.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. They have short black "espresso," the cappuccino is served with cream (not foam), and tea is offered without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but they are wonderful.
There are many excursions organized around the reef throughout the year, and injuries at the reef due to any of those reasons are rare.
Nevertheless, consult with the authorities, comply with all the set rules, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near the coasts and river mouths north of the city of 1770 from October to April. Occasionally, they can also be encountered outside of that period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Many sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is located in the river deltas north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance reassures the traveler that there will be a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfer services to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (for example, a visa) for your destination, they can also hold your reservation.
Any changes or requests should be sent directly through the travel agency first, not to the hotel.
At some festivals, a large number of participants who attend music festivals decide to camp there, and the majority of the participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should arrive early in the morning to set up camp near the music.
Remember, even if the music ends in the main scenes, there may be parts that will continue the music until late at the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are traveling in the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as passing through ice makes a terrifying crackle for those who suffer most.
The time spent in the city is also included in the Saint Petersburg cruises. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money that guests spend. Often there are no windows and clocks, and it is difficult to find the exits.
Their guests often have special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them entertained and staying at the facility.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages at their own expense. However, intoxication hinders sound judgment, and all good gamblers understand the importance of not being reckless.
Anyone who intends to drive in high altitudes or mountain passes should be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive the car as if you are driving on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to bury you in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited with snowfall or blizzards, or when the car windows fog up or freeze.
On the other hand, in many countries, icy and snowy conditions are common, and traffic often continues smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the main reason for many travelers.
In common usage, the term safari refers to traveling overland to see the astonishing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment will allow for a good observation of them.
Tigers, snow leopards, and clouded leopards are sometimes shy, and you might prefer viewing them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "hiking trip," "safari hike," or "walking tour") consists of a few hours or several days of walking excursions.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places in Japan.
In 1964, Tokyo, which hosted the games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation guidelines vary, but in the case at the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation rules are not extended until July of the scheduled Olympic Games in 2020.
Most of the event tickets are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while standard tickets are anticipated to be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent even if they're not in the room.
If there is no iron or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful, the fabric should not overheat (it can lead to wrinkling or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in other places several minutes are needed.
