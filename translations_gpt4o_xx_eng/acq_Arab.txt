This thing does not just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widely accepted theory. But it also provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers were chestnut brown on the top and its underside was pale or carotenoid-colored.
The discovery also provides a deep understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a complete bony series called the "spinal column," they have other feather characteristics—such as ridges and minor protrusions. The researchers concluded that the spinal column was likely an evolutionary development that came after these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flying but only for regulating temperature or for display. The researchers suggest that although this fossil belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers, not just a chick's down.
The researchers pointed out that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers, not chick feathers.

The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, signed a bill prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill stipulates placing a label with "18" on violent video games sold in California, and penalizes selling them to minors with a fine of up to $1,000 for each offense.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, made a statement this morning in which he announced the prosecution of both Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne resigned and it is expected that he will be replaced in the Cabinet by MP Ed Davey. MP Norman Lamb is expected to take the position of Business Minister that Davey is leaving.
Houhan and Bryce are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on February 16.
Among the casualties were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Figueroa was injured in his arm and jaw while Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery for his face.
"Schneider" suffers from constant pain, blindness in one eye, and has lost part of his skull with his face rebuilt from titanium. All this happened when the "Oka" weapon failed as it was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider gave his testimony via a video link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
After the Wednesday event, Karbanedo competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was the slalom race, where she received a "Did Not Finish" result in her first run. A total of 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in that race.
Her second race - the giant slalom - saw her finishing in tenth place in the women's sitting category with a total running time of 4:41.30, which was slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the disabled team failed to complete their rounds, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to achieve a ranking in the giant slalom race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone D812.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjjar, Botha Kanga, Rambro Kanjjar, Gaza Kanjjar, and Vishnu Kanjjar.

Despite the presence of three people inside the house at the time the car crashed into it, none of them got injured.
Only the driver was seriously injured in the head.
They have temporarily closed the road where the collision occurred, and at the same time, emergency services rescued the drivers from a red Audi TT car.
They had initially taken him to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And then he was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court accused of killing her son.
She is in detention, awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be questionable because her picture has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other places in Britain, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have considered that publishing the photos could be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee indicates that "It seems to me that journalists are certainly heading in a dangerous direction because they published images or something similar of the rights of the suspects."
The Crown's office, generally responsible for the allegations, indicated to the journalists that there would be no further comments until at least after the accusation.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The other topics that are said to have been covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered an important issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authority agrees to continue this presence for only five years.
The guards were supposed to exercise strict supervision over the released individuals in the supplementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Sporting Shooters Association of Australia," qualified volunteers were selected as part of the association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the Parks and Heritage Conservation Organization affiliated with NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have received safety guidance and comprehensive training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new interim electoral council composed of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim electoral council as part of a series of measures to steer the country toward new elections.
The committee was considered to be Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, occurred due to the failure to hold the elections that were supposed to be conducted since 2011.
About 60 cases of excessive temperature malfunctions in "iPod" devices have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded to the invitation to delay the report by Apple, saying it was "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (Friday 09:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damages have been reported in the region.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a possible tsunami wave.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired shots from his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead at this moment.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to rush to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Ligeinz followed in his father's footsteps and took up medicine as his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist and then began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
"Legins" began investigating premature births during his free time while working at the hospital.
His research demonstrated that administering a particular hormone accelerates the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
"Xinhua" reported that government investigators reviewed the flight recorders, or what is known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
The wrestler colleagues also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, there is no one like her."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as eccentric as I am... and maybe more than me... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those included in the survey agree with this point of view, and they wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
As for the two opposing sides in the survey, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The fitness of the Olympic gold medalist has come into question due to his exhaustion, as he was supposed to swim 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because the use of these medications is prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different devices and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth as well as organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed from the collision of comets with the Earth a long time ago.
Komo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political nonsense and absurdity."
He is expected to run for presidency in 2016.
NexGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of a plane and provide pilots with more specific information.
There are no additional transportation means, and the ground trains do not stop at Wembley, in addition to the lack of parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Concerns over a shortage of transportation means have raised the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, without the presence of the team's rightful fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" mentioned the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although it was thought that this process would take much longer - due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the migrant cactus finch, and the sharp-beaked ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be coiled and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stuck onto another metal, and it can be thin enough that it was sometimes used to embellish hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
They call it the pH value of the chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this value using red cabbage juice.
The color of the kubesh juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
They measure the pH level by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance to be tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then knead them with clean, wet hands until they form into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will interact with the outer layers, and this will make you feel a strange sensation and form a kind of covering.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro each had toilets with discharge mechanisms in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Discovery of sewage system remnants in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would go together in a mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then transmits it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel astonishingly changed the shape of the world; however, the most important contribution it made for us remains providing an easier and faster means of transport.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
There are further down the ranks more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging between rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small mammals (including stray pet cats) that eat the more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, with a special role for each cat that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social big cats and live in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, in addition to up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closer to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, animals similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger knows climbing (even if not very well), swimming, long-distance jumping, and pulling with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full sound of the lion's roar; it's more like yelling with angry words.
Pygmy tigers love to eat small animals; they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals hunted by the pygmy tiger are smaller than it in size.
Scientists believe that caracal cats track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell; they sniff out where they have been on the ground.
You can see well in the dark using night vision, and move quietly too. The pygmy leopards hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a few individuals) is separated from the main population they belong to (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island so that they can't easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group needs different qualities or adaptation methods to become a stronger competitor compared to what it initially needed.
There hasn't been any change at all to the indigenous people, and they still require the same adaptation methods as we have known them.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other residents gradually decreases.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the shape of the two groups will be different to the extent that we cannot call them the same species.
We call this process the emergence of species, which simply means the formation of new species. The emergence of species is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans produce (i.e., exhalation).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We repair our houses and clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaws were studded with more than 70 blade-like teeth, along with a second set on the roof of her mouth, which means there was no escape for anything in her path.
We do not know for certain, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet includes turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he might have been a carnivore.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't compare to it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans have their share of unusual or non-standard festive elements, among them wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent known as the dormouse.
There was another difference, which was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together, reclining on their sides as they ate their meals.
It was not possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single one of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods during festivals and holidays.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a secure sanctuary that only the priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes unique towers shaped like pyramids called ziggurats were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not of great importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open tables overlooking the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Humans have sparsely inhabited Greenland. It is told in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on charges of murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were living there before.
There were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history in the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," despite the fact that each country was "Scandinavian."
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text is not specifically known, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings on the fateful day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
France was governed by "Vichy." These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France, and they were on their way towards Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The origin of the word civilization is from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, which also defines it in terms of social mass.
Self-governing cities are like the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture implicitly means the transfer of knowledge across multiple generations, a residual cultural imprint, and the fair dissemination of knowledge.
Smaller cultures often fade away without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with Congress being the sole component of it — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Additionally, you do not have the authority to override the tax laws and tariffs imposed between the states.
The materials required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended, and the states mocked the central government to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is considered the second most successful team in the world, and they were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands owned by Japan, it is often referred to from a geographical perspective as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its journey back in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Iha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan and began altering the method of producing native grains and employing Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
In the year 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image film format in the world is 35 millimeter, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production continues to this day, but more importantly, the shape of image sensors in digital cameras has inherited the aspect ratio.
The 35mm model is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this image is (when divided by 12 to obtain the ratio in the simplest whole number) therefore it will be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Image System Format group, for example) equate or approximate this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and laughed at, forms a simple guiding principle that works to create dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a clear picture.
It is noted that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subject to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity bound European countries together for more than a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power I possessed affected everyone, starting from the king down to the subjects.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth is necessary and should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question the extent of adherence to the tenets of the faith.
Britain quickly took the initiative to blockade Germany by sea after the skirmishes broke out.
The strategy has proven its effectiveness; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating generally accepted international law, which has been documented and coordinated in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined the international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, which even threatens ships not involved in the war.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling dynasty was of a different kind.
Additionally, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each ruling dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out among many nobles in pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the most bloody eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in battles to sit on the highest seats in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to the ruler alone.
Moreover, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, and this allowed the more ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army because, instead of the army's classifications being based on class, they are now based on calibers.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to spark their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad was very interested in matters that go beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" atop the "Nur" mountain for meditation.
The cave itself, which has remained throughout the ages, presents a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it at all, even if you know where it is. As soon as you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
And you can't see anything but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. It’s almost impossible to see or hear much of this world inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists to this day.
It was built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built to bury the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The shape of the "up-bow" sign is like the letter V, and the shape of the "down-bow" sign is like a stapler or a square without the bottom side of it.
The top mark indicates that you must start from the end and push the bow, while the bottom mark signifies that you must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more tense.
Do not hesitate to draw your own marks with a pencil, just remember that the printed curved marks are there for a musical reason, so they must usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Thérèse, who was 11 years old, and Louis Charles, who was four years old), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced, on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people who were shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A group of fans managed to compel the king and queen to open their car windows wide.
At one point, a member of the gang waved the head of one of the killed royal guards in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people bore the expenses of the imperial American war by its invasion of the Philippines.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover a significant part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Naturally, the substantial profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
We need to understand the motivating context for the establishment of the organization, in order to understand the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which altogether ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two main common ideas in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has "effects" on established societies, rather than being connected to society.
For example, someone might say that the car engine needs to have improvements for the roads.
However, building a road network along the country is not economically beneficial if there are few cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in healthcare to treat affected people.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time, the customs and culture connected to that geography emerged. These, being in harmony with the community's place, were considered better than laws imposed by force.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in the year 400 AD and continued until the year 1100 AD.
Its condition declined during the twelfth century mainly because of the fact that the Crusades returned bringing with them gifts like silk and spices, which had a higher value than those brought by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was given to Paris instead of Constantinople.
Gothic style reached its peak between the tenth or eleventh century and the fourteenth century.
In the beginning, Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on clothing.
Despite that, due to the slowness of communication channels, trends in the West may be delayed by about 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began using rice to hem clothes.
Subsistence farming is the type of agriculture where they farm to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence farming - which often involves no fertilizers or pesticides - is a simple system that uses stored seeds adapted to the region's ecosystem. In addition, it employs crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers worked in subsistence farming, and this is still prevalent in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile individuals who think alike and feel neglected by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterized by the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that may define the distinction of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their right to membership through various symbolic uses of style, including clothing, mannerisms, and jargon.
Among the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the reliance on the few unfortunate cases of children who suffered, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, and were not socially connected by adults during their upbringing.
They refer to these children as "the wild" or "the feral." Some of the homeless children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child was abandoned due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
The wild children might have been subjected to abuse when they were children or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others say they were raised by animals; it is said that some lived in the wild alone.
When a child is raised by animals rather than humans, the behavior of the feral child (within physical limits) closely resembles the behaviors of the specific nurturing animal, such as fear of humans or not caring about them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not just a method of learning, but truly a supportive tool that provides assistance to individuals who are undergoing a new educational experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be both virtual and in-person. In other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, much like the paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning within the program is internally supported and aims to pose questions, provide motivation, and explain procedures that may be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment lacking nurturing, care, and education, but they do.
We understand that the foster care system is considered a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that were missing in the homes they left before.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and personal communication.
The distinctive features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usage and methods of gratification.
For example, some propose "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions of the face, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
It is specifically claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
In fact, it suggests the idea that these abilities to analyze human behavior might be shared with some animals, such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: a latent group and an apparent one.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive differences.
The processes of separation and recombination work to make the variation random, interchanging and reverting between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to obtain the amino acids they need from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failing to do so leads to severe consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The plant resources that are easily accessible in abundance are the proteins that we can obtain from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high amounts of proteins and contain all the essential amino acids.
When taking everything into consideration, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do on the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your natural sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes).
And you can do this easily by using a relatively calm alarm that brings you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to stop it.
The second options, based on biological systems, include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before sleeping, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and spirit.
If stress diminishes, the positivity granted by the power of life increases. Every person has the innate ability to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs us on the path to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has expanded through the Mahayana path of compassion and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everyone.
The "Kundalini" energy (enlightenment energy) awakens through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chants, and visualizations with "Kundalini Yoga".
The Tibetan meditation center is the god Yoga. Through visualizing the different deities, they cleanse the energy channels, activate the chakras, and create enlightenment awareness.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which made the Soviet Union and the United States cooperate. However, by the end of the war, the clash of systems, policies, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, with fighting on the ground by proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had truly collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became outdated overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Treaty of Riga for Peace, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditions have held that the role of the naval forces is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting the enemy's ability to transport its people and goods.
One of the recent examples worth noting is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, and their weapon for this was the use of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to invade Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them because accessing milk, hair, meat, and skins was easy.
The domestic goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or secondary grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were typically children or teenagers, in the same manner as the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used to this day.
Cart roads were established in England as far back as the 16th century.
Despite the fact that the old railway carriages were made up of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them in order to achieve greater speeds and haul heavier loads compared to the roads, which at that time were considered more than rugged.
They invented train tracks a little early to stabilize the routes, but it later became clear over time that placing a steel strip on top of the track made it more effective.
That became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the carts to wear down more.
In the end, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In the year 1767, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
Species with two feet were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to slightly reduce future suffering.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not just desire a temporary solution, we must know the root of the problems, and we must eliminate them.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and the problems have become greater due to the increase in population and the luxurious lifestyle that human rights allow.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, they sent a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
At night, they copied between 150 to 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
They sent one of them to George Washington on the sixth of July, and he read it to his troops in New York on the ninth of July. A copy of it reached London on the tenth of August.
The twenty-five Dunlap broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence document, but the original handwritten version is no longer available.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
Many do not think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still kind of resemble dinosaurs.
It has feet with protective outer layers and claws, lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a liranosaurus.
Virtually all computers used today rely on processing information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning symptoms may not appear right away. A quick diagnosis can't be made when symptoms such as vomiting appear, as they are general enough.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of toxic household remedies or chemicals.
Read the poster to learn about the specific poison's first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge regarding bed bugs, which are insects that have significantly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the "assassin bug" and the "bed bug" are characterized by a long incubation period and adapt to living in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the likelihood of females developing multiple sclerosis is twice as high as that of males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or their child's best interest to raise an infant.
These couples may choose to plan an adoption for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific method. In reality, this method guides most scientific research.
Despite that, it is not unique in this regard; experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to examine the validity of one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, particularly on the Bible in Latin.
They accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
While knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of self-sustaining cycles and their production through biological clocks.
They documented the rhythmic cycles, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, of most living organisms, including those specific to bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillators that continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either the nucleic acid of the phages using radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including both plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning information about this type of ape (orangutans) in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to head to their workplaces, and on their way, they meet other people who work in the place they have just left.
In this vibrant mode of transportation, everyone somewhat supports and is connected to a transport system primarily based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this huge carbon-dependent economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems. Everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In advanced countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers not competent? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic movement is difficult because it's not possible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic enjoys reasonable consistency and can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better clarify the flow of traffic, they established relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings backwards along the length of their bodies.
This gives them a larger set of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some saw that he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems logical because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching widths of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the continued construction of stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the pyramids in Giza are unparalleled in terms of size and artistic distinction in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which had been built over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and has the least population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language for its legislations and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life used by most state workers, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted somewhat easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, despite his assumption that they also transform into new materials to form what we see.
Alloys are primarily a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are, of course, also metals like silver and gold.
You can also obtain alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. All substances were created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can occupy the space of the dot at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil has been a good friend to many people since it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without needing to use a pen.
And one can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by gathering energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The core splits again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no movement.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust reaches about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner under Maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously when they reach adulthood.
These theories explore what makes certain individuals desire the things they do and the aspects in their surrounding environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead former colleagues of the same age; one is the attempt to stay "like the others."
Managers of this type face difficulty in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, defining responsibilities, and holding individuals accountable.
On the opposite side, the individual turns into a person who is unrecognizable, feeling that he/she must change everything the team had been doing and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Usually, virtual team members act as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have greater independence than members of traditional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a "real hidden team" was described by (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member submits their reports to the management team, "the invisible team". The "invisible team" then sets the standards for each member.
Why would any organization want to set up an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is considered one of the objectives of applying institutional learning concepts.
By effectively utilizing all available resources across the organizational functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can be achieved.
Consequently, collaboration within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the development of new innovative processes that meet the client’s needs.
Before the organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuity strategy as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide concrete evidence for the theoretical approach in the pursuit of knowledge. Thus, it works on reducing the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between the science of brain diseases and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes in ways we did not understand before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate fields focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been used to develop several software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a big part of any classroom. Often, the teacher might want to take her students to places where going by bus is considered impossible.
Technology allows the solution through virtual field visits. Students can watch the artifacts in the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a nice way to remember a particular trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
And since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts improving their writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogs also 'force students to become more intelligent about the world around them.' The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be skillful and useful (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through effective responses to online materials, students can determine their positions in the context of others' writings as well as identify their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada, featuring a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You will find Niagara Falls to the south, and to the north there is a country with natural beauty that no one has exploited, in Moscow and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the thing that is considered the essence of Canada to outsiders.
The large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated, and some have almost no inhabitants.
In terms of comparing the population sizes that leave many astonished: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
The island of Madagascar is by far the largest, and it is an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are either independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxurious coastal resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread significantly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the fifteenth century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of actual marital status, female travelers should declare that they are married.
It is better to wear a ring (but not the one that looks very expensive).
Women must know that cultural differences may lead to what they might consider harassment, and that it is common to monitor them, hold them by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don’t make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port named "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," but they abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name "Dar al-Badia," and the Spanish traders called it "Casablanca" where they established trade posts.
Casablanca is considered one of the least exciting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Finding places that sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city is easy, such as pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of cheap goods, but all these are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which submerged most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside "Goma" are necessary to research in order to understand the ongoing fighting in North "Kivu" province, while "Goma" is reasonably safe.
The city is also considered a base for climbing the Nyiragongo Volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking routes in Africa.
You can take a boda boda (which is a motorcycle taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Besides being a bit difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic lands.
The city of Timbuktu is currently considered a poor city, despite its reputation that has made it a tourist attraction, in addition to having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stations for Henry Louis Gates in his PBS series about the wonders of the African world.
The city differs very strongly from the rest of the country's cities, as it features a character that is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, stretching along the Mozambican border to the east, the Zimbabwean border to the north, and bordered to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive areas in South Africa, and also a major park of the national parks in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee to maintain and enter the park, just like all national parks in South Africa.
You'd better buy a Wild Card; it allows you to access a select group of South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is the place many tourists consider their destination.
The lined-up buildings that shape the Hong Kong skyline resemble a glistening chart displayed above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for a distance of 80 kilometers (50 miles) in remote coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
They declared the Sundarbans a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps of mangrove trees; they contain some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the inter-regional station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because the buses between neighborhoods are usually full, it's best to buy tickets in advance a few days earlier.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, their length is 378 meters, and they have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is supposed to start operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The "Guarani" were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now known as Eastern Paraguay. The "Guarani" people lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to a second set of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, which was formerly known as "the Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Additionally, smaller championships and matches can be watched here at different times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and places to buy polo match tickets, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at a value equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located at Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar is often accepted as well.
In remote islands, there is a possibility that they may not accept credit cards, although they might accept British and American currency; check with the owners beforehand to know the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so it is necessary to exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer occurs there at the time when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
The amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year, as there are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife ultimately remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, sit at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals may attack.
Many guests get injured every year because they don't sit far away, and these animals are big, wild, and dangerous, so they need to be given a special space.
Additionally, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking foods with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Abia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of infamous naval confrontations in the year 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Around 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mao movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to the location of "Auckland" between two harbors, there are many beaches, with the most popular ones located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, making swimming safe, and most of them are shaded by the botoqua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good selection of shops lined up along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main popular beer is known as "Number One", it is not a complex drink, but rather a fun and refreshing beverage. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many kinds of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wine might become more popular.
The tap water in the area is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "Flat White" coffee is strange. The small black coffee is an "espresso," while the cappuccino has a layer of cream on top (not foam), and they serve tea without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although their price is extremely high.
They conduct many trips to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reefs rarely occur for any of these reasons.
Meanwhile, seek advice from the authorities, adhere to all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish can be found near the shores and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. It can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks already exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans, and when they see them, they run away.
Saltwater crocodiles usually live in the ocean, and their primary habitat is located at the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking reassures the traveler that there will be a place to sleep when he reaches his intended destination.
Although you can get other forms of accommodations, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
Travel agents have become accustomed to offering packages that include breakfast and arrangements for transportation to and from the airport, or even bundled packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests must be directed through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to camp at the site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you must enter early so that you can secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there are sections of the festival that may continue playing music until late at night.
Some festivals include special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea area in winter, you must check the location of the cabin, as passing through the ice causes a very loud noise for the most affected people.
St. Petersburg cruises include spending some time walking around the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to increase the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment shows to maintain the guests' good mood and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but intoxication hinders correct judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of the gambler staying sober-minded.
Everyone driving their car at high altitudes or over mountain passes must be aware of the possibility of snowfall, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
During snowstorms, an amount of snow may fall that is enough to stop you for a very short time.
The falling of snow, blowing of icy winds, condensation, or the presence of ice on car windows may cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic usually continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safari trips might be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most famous for many visitors.
The term safari trips is usually used to refer to traveling across a country to see the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come very close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Sometimes lions, leopards, and tigers feel shy, and you can see them beautifully through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "jungle trek" or "hiking" or "trekking") consists of long-distance walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games took place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, and some events of the games were held at different locations across Japan.
After hosting the Olympic Games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were no longer in effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to be held.
Most of the event tickets are expected to be priced between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while the typical regular cost will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps to dry them. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Don't let the fabric get too hot (which could cause it to shrink or even burn in the worst case).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, it is enough to heat the water for a minute, while in other areas you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in terms of effectiveness; if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in tightly sealed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers are likely to encounter animal pests unknown to them in their regions of origin.
Pests may spoil food, cause annoyance, or cause allergies in the worst cases, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can potentially harm or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping at the duty-free market is an opportunity to buy goods without taxes and fees in specific places.
Travelers heading to countries that impose high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont contains the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it regularly passes through isolated forest terrains.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and succeeding sections—usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and strict adherence to them is more important than anything else.
Strangely, it seems that the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in the other areas along the way, such as the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are excellent, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and diverse, resembling the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common where they cook apples in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums appear in the summer days.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other types of tree nuts, and they often eat the traditional cake especially with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small and rich pastries, try what is called a Berliner or Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
Indonesian food represents a comprehensive term that includes a large variety of regional cuisines spread across Indonesia, due to the presence of 17,000 islands in Indonesia to differentiate among them.
However, if it is used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely spread all over the archipelago islands, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes. The predominant flavors favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but there can be safety concerns with it due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in it.
If a rider falls off the horse but his foot remains stuck in the stirrup, the horse might drag him if it runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First, most horse riders wear riding boots that have a heel and a very tight soft sole.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to fall off the saddle when pulled backward as the rider dismounts.
Cochamo Valley - the top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and large granite rocks.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes among the endless potential walls, where the summits offer breathtaking views from above.
Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered spot on the ground with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is considered a main activity during travel, with a large number of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient — cave paintings depicting skiers date back to the year 5000 BC!
The history of skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking skiing: This activity is also known as skiing in uninhabited areas, or ski trips or long-distance hiking on snow.
It is associated with alpine ski tours or mountain climbing, but it is not usually limited to ski tours or mountain climbing, as they are practiced on steep terrains and require sturdier skis and tall boots.
Think of the ice skating trail as a path similar to hiking.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than by walking, but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across several countries means you have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
Despite that, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without needing to pass through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for entry visas for each of the Schengen member states individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are over one hundred years old, but there is no comprehensive definition for what we consider to be antiques among manufactured items.
The definition includes geographical differences, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be recognized as artifacts even though they are newer than similar goods that were mass-produced in the distant past.
Reindeer herding is considered an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many people in other professions.
Even traditionally, despite that, not all Sami communities widely engaged in reindeer herding, but they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and primarily used reindeer as draft animals.
Many Sami today work in modern crafts. Tourism is considered an important income in Sápmi, the region of the Sami.
Despite the widespread use of the word "Gypsy," especially among non-Romani communities, it is considered an offensive term because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you plan to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but the advice of those governments is issued specifically for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations that differ from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are merely a summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often quick, general, and simplified compared to the detailed information available in other places.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it depending on the geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, hurricanes, floods, and cyclones.

Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risks of severe weather events in the places they visit due to their impact on their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must receive professional training.
You might find from searching the internet for "hostile environment course" the name of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues that are discussed here in much greater detail and is usually through practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines that explain survival in the wilderness, while publications that explain war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without mentioning a gender (X) or to issue new documents to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
And the inspections at security checkpoints became much more invasive of privacy in the years following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity before surgery.
Rip currents are the backflow from the waves that break on the shore, often near coral reefs or something of that sort.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current to the deep waters may form there.
Most of the fatalities occur from the exhaustion of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back will be no less easy than usual.
Try to target a place where the current doesn't control you again or, depending on your skills and whether someone notices your presence, waiting for rescue might be a second option.
The shock of returning to the homeland occurs faster than cultural shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes, travelers who easily adapt to the new culture face particular difficulty in readapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits that are part of your own country's culture.
When I first traveled abroad, perhaps the people were patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also essential things for travelers returning to their countries.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most enjoyable things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids with agility and silently before the show starts.
You can always usually hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is like the story of a book.
The Sphinx was used as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
They show scenes of the pyramids and light up the different pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries as their own, and they have the most bases, with the number of active ones reaching 16 in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island, which has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among other places are Livingston Island and Deception, where the caldera, submerged by a recently active volcano, provides a picturesque natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area located south of the Peninsula, and it is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, and then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which extend for a distance of 360 km and are divided by the Minnesota Glacier River.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, where its peak reaches the equivalent of 4,892 meters, Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, where there is no cellular phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not always an alternative to a mobile phone, meaning you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used through shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice.
There must be a local phone service provider capable of providing more information about how to contact this service.
Traveling and learning are very popular options among those who are planning for a gap year.
The job is popular, especially among those who have finished high school, as it allows them to spend a year before enrolling in university, without risking their education.
Often, enrolling in a one-year training course abroad can improve your chances of getting into higher education in your home country when you return.
There are usually fees for registering in those educational programs.
Finland is considered a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also contains thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boats are a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is entirely unique (for example in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most premium Baltic trips feature an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few entire days during the return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you are traveling on coastal exploration trips by ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of the year 2009).
Some tours to the German city of Berlin are highlighted in the brochures; as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not a place close to the sea, and the tour price does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by airplane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have experienced a traumatic incident.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not much different from personal fears and other disliked things that many people have.
Understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during the flight may help some people overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or from a lack of control.
They pay good amounts to shipping companies to deliver things quickly. Time is usually very important when it comes to business documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies own their own planes on some routes, but there was an issue for the other routes and the smaller companies.
If they send the items by air freight, the process might take several days on some routes due to unloading and customs.
Sending parcels as checked luggage was the only way to receive them quickly, but the airline companies' internal regulations do not allow for sending luggage without a passenger, thus your role comes into play at this stage.
The obvious way to be able to travel in first class or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to obtain this privilege (or, it's better for you to have your company handle it).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a strict rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there is no benefit in searching for discounts on business class or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
The airline knows well that there is a specific main group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to a place quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member state.
The economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were reestablished despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in "Moldova" is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is considered the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million people. It also has the second largest port after Istanbul and is also considered an outstanding transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna was once, and is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located around a large bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers with traditional red-tiled roofs, the eighteenth-century market, and the old mosques and churches characterize the city, even though it has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere compared to traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a unique church with an octagonal design.
In the churchyard, there are exquisite marble statues of doves above some graves.
The task deserves half an hour of wandering in the interesting village.
The beautiful romantic city of Sintra is located to the north in an easily accessible place, and it is the city that became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron's stunning accounts of its wonders.
The "Scooter 403" bus regularly travels to "Sintra" and stops at "Cabo da Roca".
On top of all this, to the north, you can visit the Great Shrine of Lady Fatima (a sacred tomb), which is a site of the famous Marian apparitions known worldwide.
Please remember that you are essentially at the site of a mass grave, in addition to it being a place that holds an almost infinite meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, as well as many others who had loved ones killed or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by placing marks or inappropriate writings on the walls of the buildings.
The city of Barcelona has two official languages: Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Nonetheless, most of the signs are expressed in Catalan because, according to the law, it is considered the first official language.
Despite that, the use of the Spanish language is common in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are broadcast only in Catalan, while unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The people of Paris are famous for being selfish, rude, and arrogant.
The best way to get along in the city of Paris is to behave well like a "bien élevé" person, which means well-mannered, although it usually doesn't go beyond being a false stereotype.
The crude Parisian outer parts quickly evaporate if you extend some basic courtesies.
The dense forests fill the Plitvice Lakes National Park, primarily consisting of beech, fir, and spruce trees, and are distinguished by a combination of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a large and diverse collection of plant communities, due to the range of local climates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The region also hosts a very diverse range of animal and bird species.
Animals of rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the grouse can be found there, alongside many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a scarf for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own scarf, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this from the storage at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The preparation of food in Mallorca, like the rest of the Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meats (especially pork), with the use of olive oil in all of that.
"Bread with olive oil" is considered an example of a simple traditional dinner, especially during the summer season: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, and any available condiments such as cheese, tuna, and so on.
All names, in addition to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even within a sentence.
It is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and the names of things.
It can also be said that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complex due to the need to know whether the verb or adjective is used in an affirmative form.
Pronunciation in Italian is almost easy because some people pronounce most of the words exactly as they are written.
The main letters that we need to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "karo" means dear, while "karro" means cart.
The Persian language has relatively easy and often familiar grammar rules.
Therefore, reading this grammatical introduction helps you learn more about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that your knowledge of a Romance language makes it easier for you to learn Portuguese.
Nevertheless, people who know a little Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to Spanish, meaning it's not necessary to study it separately.
Observatories that are usually newly built are often not suitable for use today, and they remain as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution was not at its peak as one of their important problems as it is these days, they are usually found in cities or university campuses, and reaching them is easier than reaching those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with suitable weather conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms—known as Hanami—has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the most popular.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom parties exclusively for himself and other members of the noble class around the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when they remain in a natural environment, so resist your urge to pick them even if it's just "one sample".
When visiting a formally landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" also leads to your expulsion, without discussion.
Generally, the country of Singapore is considered a very safe place and it is very easy to move around, where you can buy almost anything after arriving.
But due to its location "close to tropical areas" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to deal with both: the excessive and continuous heat and the blazing sun (and that is rare when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses heading north to the city of Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs "Abraham," "Isaac," and "Jacob" and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement.
Internal water canals can be a good idea for a holiday stay.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube River, or canoeing along the Erie Canal.
The internal waterways also define the common routes for walking and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Christ.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have also adopted many of the traditions surrounding the holidays.
There is a tradition of staying awake all night on Easter until the end in an open place to watch the sunrise.
This tradition can certainly be interpreted from a Christian theological perspective, but there is a possibility that it was a religious ritual for spring and fertility before the time of Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on Saturday during Easter weekend, and the congregations often begin celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands either swam, flew, or floated.
Because of the distance from the continent, mammals couldn't make the journey, which is why the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats, and dogs.
If you decide to visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to watch the aurora, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are somewhat populated and light pollution is mostly not an issue, you can also enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are the traditional business attire, and coworkers call each other by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is considered a very important matter, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers are expected to obey their supervisors' instructions without discussion, and they often need to obtain their supervisors' approval for any decisions they make.
