Besides proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory already widely accepted—it allows for viewing details that are usually not seen in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to the scientists, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown, and its underside was light or yellowish-red.
The discovery allows a glimpse into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a developed feather shaft, called the rachis, but they do have other parts of feathers – the vane and the downy base of the barbs – scientists concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than the remaining parts.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers proposed that the specimen is an example of adult plumage, not chick down, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur.
Scientists hypothesized that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not chick down feathers.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark substances in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is positioned as a halo around the galaxy and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a previously printed paper with the name of the chosen candidate into an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs their name on the voter list.
The procedural rules of the French electoral law are quite strictly formulated in the legislation.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of voting and that no other envelopes are added except those that are duly accounted for and placed there by eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are recounted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific guidelines.

In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's category with a combined time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the time of the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who won first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the time of the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers from the women's starting group did not finish, and out of the 117 participants in the giant slalom, 45 did not secure a place in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy inspector general of police D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
When the car hit the house, there were three people inside, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the rescue service freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for medical treatment.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused of the murder of her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He has been taken into custody until the charge is filed and the trial is held, but any eyewitness testimony may be of questionable value because his picture has been published in many places.
Elsewhere in the UK, it is standard practice, but in Scotland, the administration of justice works differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants it to be based on the border prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
The other topics discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that after signing the agreement, military presence be ensured in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave the military there for only five years.
In an additional pest control test, the shooters participating were closely monitored by forest rangers, as the test was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.

According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park protection and cultural heritage at NPWS, four shooters were selected for the first shooting operation, receiving thorough safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission issued a recommendation for the resignation of the previous acting president as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sporadic violent protests were triggered by the failure to organize elections, some of which had been anticipated since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, which in total have caused six fires and resulted in minor burns to four people.
According to the data from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), there were 27 accidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company referred to as "non-serious."
In response, the ministry called the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 in the morning local time (09:19 GMT on Friday evening).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami forming.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and it has been confirmed that at least six are dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was neutralized by shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and made a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While Liggins was working in the hospital, he began researching premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that if a certain hormone is administered to the fetus, it accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders from the plane on Wednesday.
Colleagues from wrestling also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the second month. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as weird as I am … maybe even weirder … love her and miss her … hopefully she is in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants agree, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the results, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle swimming and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, his readiness is in question.
He has not been able to take the medication he needs to overcome the pain because they are prohibited at the Olympic Games.
Mathematician and University of Central Missouri computer science professor Curtis Cooper discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets supplied Earth with water, along with organic substances that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors political gossip and nonsense.
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of older ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
"Additional transport is not provided, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, plus there are no surface car parks and 'park and ride' facilities."
For fear of transport shortages, the possibility was raised that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday announced the emergence of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species developed in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer. The endemic medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, interbred.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny figures.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted or braided. It can be beaten or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, which were called illuminated manuscripts.
It is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator for yourself with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions present in the chemical under investigation (H in pH stands for hydrogen).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze it into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture of your hands reacts with the outer layers, which creates a funny feeling and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of the cities of the Minoan culture, and in Greece in Santorini.
Toilets existed also in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women were mixed together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts the light and the view.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important change that the wheel has brought us is significantly easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to this, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
On the lower tier are medium-sized felines, whose prey comprises medium-sized animals, starting with hares and ending with antelopes and goats.
Finally, there are many small felines (including stray domestic cats), which eat significantly more small prey animals, like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, the specific task that each cat does, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups, known as prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually very closely related to each other, forming a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in many ways like wolf and dog packs – animals, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a versatile athlete, is able to climb (although not well), swim, cover large distances by jumping, and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four felines can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but rather a sentence of growlingly shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than it is.
According to scientists, lynxes track and find their prey (victims) by smell, by sniffing the places where they have been.
Their ability to see in the dark is excellent, and they also move very stealthily. The ocelot blends into the surrounding environment to hunt prey and then pounces on the catch.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, they move across a mountain range or river or relocate to a new island, and returning is not easy), they often find themselves in an environment different from the previous one.
In the new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population requires different traits than before and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
As a result, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants make food for themselves from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In its long jaws were over 70 razor-sharp teeth, with additional teeth on the palate, meaning that nothing crossing its path could escape.
It is not known for certain, but the mosasaurus may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a man-eater.
He attacked everyone who went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex was no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that although poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked banquets where they ate while reclining.
Foods from Ancient Rome could not contain ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests took care of the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests may enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were constructed as part of the temples.
The tower top was a special shrine to the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The Jewish family conducted most of their activities outdoors.
The women cooked outside; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, which made wood extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to ancient Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is located at the bottom of the document, turned upside down.
Although nobody knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years, the large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches) was stored rolled up.
It is likely that the note was simply added as a tag.
D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
The Vichy French governed there. These were the people of France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded Southern France, and this action became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the liberated French forces had freed the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, or a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "citizen-related," and is associated with the Latin words "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city or city-state," and it somewhat defines the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of countries. Civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and sufficient cultural dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress being its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities for the implementation of all laws, who were often not very cooperative.
Nor did he have the authority to cancel tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the most successful team in the world alongside the German national football team, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in this field in international events and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of Japanese islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the government of the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded the governance of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures – namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more important is that its proportions were inherited by the dimensions of digital camera image sensors.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format group) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often exploited and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a measure of order in an image.
According to this, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be carefully monitored.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European countries, despite the differences between their languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial resources are intended for this purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised the question among many whether this principle was adhered to.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective – it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law, which has been recorded in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since this tactic did not meet with any particular reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large part of the citizens and nations were pacifist and isolationist in their outlook.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, countries wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job in the city of New York at the Edison Company.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different time periods; each stage of Chinese history or each ruling family had a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these eras was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history; thousands of people died in internal conflicts, as they hoped to attain the highest position of power in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a sole ruler.
Even after the Revolution, industries were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they were now based on military value.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working-class representatives in many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters deeper than secular life. He often used to go to meditate in a cave on Mount Noori ('light'), which became known as Hira.
A cave that has survived the ages provides a vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, located at the top of a mountain north of Mecca.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all if it is known to exist. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except the clear beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be heard and seen inside the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many gigantic pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The mark "bow up" resembles the letter V and the mark "bow down" resembles a bracket or a square with the bottom side missing.
"Up" means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and "down" means you should start at the frog of the bow (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward stroke creates a softer sound, whereas a downward stroke is stronger and more forceful.
You are free to write down your markers, but remember that the printed bars have been added there for a musical reason and should therefore be respected.
The frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king’s sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles for Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats towards the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, one of the crowd members waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
The war expenses of the U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the costs and interest on bonds that pass through Wall Street banking institutions on behalf of the government of the Philippines.
Of course, the superprofits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the fundamental profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era during which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, and it was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally considered to have ended in the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a firm belief that human destiny is governed by the logic related to the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely uninfluenced by cultural or political factors, and that technology itself exerts influence on society, which is more inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the existence of motor vehicles certainly necessitates the development of roads.
However, the domestic road network is not economically feasible with only a few cars, which is why efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the costs associated with owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in healthcare.
An important part of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which drew on writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world today, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a place where all luxuries were concentrated began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture typical of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most notable developments resulting from the Crusades during this time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming in which food is produced in quantities sufficient only to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple, often nature-close system, where seeds obtained from the ecological region, crop rotation, or other relatively simple methods like are used to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in several developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar ideas who feel that societal standards do not apply to them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that allow a subculture to be distinguished can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on those few unfortunate cases where adults did not socialize children during upbringing due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called feral or wild. People (often their parents) have kept wild children confined; in some cases, the parents abandoned the child due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were reportedly raised by animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If a child is raised entirely by an animal, the wild child (to the extent of physical boundaries) behaves almost entirely like the animal that raised them, for example, they may fear humans or be indifferent towards them.
Although project-based learning should make acquisition easier and more interesting, the educational scaffolding approach is a step beyond that.
The scaffolding ('support') method is not a teaching method, but rather a way to support people who are acquiring a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, support can be either a teacher or the little paperclip-man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual steps are integrated into the software, aimed at questioning, referencing, and explaining procedures that may be too complex for the student to handle alone.
Children are taken to orphanages for various reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but this happens.
We find that the system of foster families represents a security zone for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
A foster family should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The peculiarities of the internet bring additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are highlighted as significant motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting facial movements that last only a few milliseconds, known as micro-expressions.
It is primarily claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks highlighted that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately recognize sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior also exist in animals, for example, domesticated dogs.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century have shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
In the case of segregation and recombination, diversity fluctuates between the two pools back and forth in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid needs using the available plants.
Moreover, if it fails to be done, it will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would have been the proteins found in leafy greens and vegetables, but for primates like us, they are easy to digest only when cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Considering all this, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep disturbance is the deliberate process of waking during a regular sleep period and falling back asleep after a short while (10–60 minutes).
It's easy if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or a well-known diuretic tea) before going to bed to force yourself to wake up for urination.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive is the present vitality. Every person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to reaching this goal is tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the countries fell out due to clashes in their systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and authorized armies were expected to actually fight on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup around the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans almost failed overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of eastern Polish territories, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large masses of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of navies has been to ensure that a country is able to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the more recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the primarily submarine-using German navy tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were originally domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them to gain easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often tended by child or teenage goat herders, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons' paths consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and haul larger amounts than on the slightly rougher roads of that time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails are more efficient when they have iron strips on top of them.
It became a conventional method, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagon more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron-made rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking — Homo erectus (or upright man) began walking upright two million years ago.
For their ancestor, Australopithecus, walking upright was not customary.
Examples of specialization on two legs are found in Australopithecus fossils, dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
In order to reduce future suffering to some extent, we can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
Often it is exactly like treating symptoms. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and neutralize it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to scientific and technological advancements of mankind, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of humanity.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, the manuscript of the draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing office of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
Between 150 to 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap copies, were made overnight.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy of it reached London on August 10.
The 25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving exemplars of the declaration. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many of today's paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds have several other characteristics that resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all modern computers are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary number format.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or – using computer slang – bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow for an immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested poison may be an open medication package or toxic household chemicals located nearby.
Check the label for instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
Entomologists officially use the term "bed bugs" for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which have adapted extremely well to live as parasites on humans.
Both bat bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to life in a nest or the host's dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that the occurrence of MS is twice as likely in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising the child is not in their or the child's best interests.

During the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to determine how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, this method is the basis for most scientific research.
Research, however, is not only guided by experimentation – an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses – but also by asking questions and observing.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.

As the knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several observable rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on endogenous cycles and are created by biological clocks.
The presence of periodic rhythms, which are not merely a reaction to external periodic factors, has been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillatory system that continues with a freely running periodicity even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage either with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, mutations elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places to enjoy views and also wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting Borneo orangutans, photographing them, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work, and in turn, others pass by them whose workplace is located where they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everything is in some way connected to and supports the transport system based on private vehicles.
Science has now shown that this massive carbon dioxide-producing economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has been favorable for human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of a similar level about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause complaints about daily failures? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study that observes the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is complicated because a driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be broadly represented mathematically.
Relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed, to better describe the traffic flow.
These connections contribute to the design, planning, and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to start moving by air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators much more easily and find food and mates much more efficiently.
Most insects are capable of folding their wings against their body.
It gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that are unable to rotate their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite – the solar system, along with the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because they can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order) – solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma – although he also speculated that they form new substances that we observe.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil, when it was first introduced, was a good friend for many.
The importance and use of the pencil have diminished because unfortunately, newer writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only speculate about what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
A nuclear bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to assemble the atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's somewhat like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Re-splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they tend to disintegrate at a slight nudge or spontaneously.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
It is thinner under the mid-ocean ridges and thicker under the highlands.
The nearer side may have more seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
The theories of achievement needs attempt to understand what drives people to act and what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are embraced during the maturation into adulthood.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want the things they do, and which environmental factors cause these people to do or not do certain things.
The two most popular needs-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start leading their former peers, it can generally elicit two types of behavior. One extreme of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the boys (or girls)".
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce discipline, conduct evaluations, assign tasks, and delegate responsibility to employees.
At the other end of the spectrum is a person who becomes unrecognizable, feeling that they must change everything the team has done so far and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failures.
Such behavior often causes disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same high demands as traditional teams, but there are still small differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their direct real-life group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management might not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is the administrative team to whom every member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
For what reason would a company undertake the time-consuming process of creating an educational organization? One of the goals of incorporating educational concepts into business activities is innovation.
When all available resources across the functional departments of the entire organization are efficiently utilized, creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge.
As a result, the company’s effort to overcome the obstacle in cooperation may lead to a new inventive process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, it delineates the field of research and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports researchers' studies.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provided us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us better understand the processes taking place in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves automating machines in such a way that they solve tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include verification, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have evolved into separate disciplines that focus on seeking solutions for real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and it is also integrated into several home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class. Often, the teacher would like to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution to this through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a tour virtually is also a great way to document a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students from North Carolina's Bennett School design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. Each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept as a memory.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. At the same time, while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Also, "blogging forces students to better understand the world around them." Capturing the readers' attention encourages students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position regarding other people's writings and provide insight into their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada, and it offers a wide range of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north stretches Muskoka along with the untouched natural beauty of the areas beyond it.
All of the above and more highlights Ontario as something characteristic of Canada for foreigners.
The large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and in some places almost uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising population comparison for many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, practically its own continent.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or affiliated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: female travelers are recommended to say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, something they consider harassment may be done, and stalking, grabbing by the hand, etc., are not uncommon.
Firmly say no to the men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that does not mean it is okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badyana, and the Spanish merchants, who established trading centers there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of different gadgets, but it is all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, burying most of the city streets, especially the downtown area.
If Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be researched in advance and an understanding of the state of ongoing conflict in North Kivu province should be obtained.
The city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and it offers the most affordable options for observing African mountain gorillas.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
In conjunction with its relatively difficult accessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
Compared to other cities in the country, it is completely different as it has more of an Arabic than African vibe.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, running along the Mozambique border to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological regions, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions, considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African nature parks, this park also has daily conservation and entry fees.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card visitor's pass, which allows entry into certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider the main attraction.
The row of buildings shaping the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to glittering bar charts, which are reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon shore.
A large part of Hong Kong Island's urban development projects are located in the densely packed land area along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonizers took for themselves. Therefore, it is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the colonial period of the territory.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that is within the territory of India is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The area of the Sundarbans is 3,850 km², about one third of which is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has also been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that the area is currently home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inner area bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The clearance height of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plans, the bridge will be fully opened for operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani indigenous people were the most notable native group that inhabited the areas of present-day Eastern Paraguay and lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunters who also practiced agriculture for subsistence.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived thanks to hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, as a result of encounters between Spanish conquerors and indigenous people, Paraguay was born, which was previously called the Giant Province of the Indies.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character.
It is well known that Argentinian water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and polo match ticket information, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is set to be equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
It is possible to exchange money at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although the currency of the United Kingdom and the United States may be accepted; consult with the owners in advance to determine the appropriate method of payment.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer occurs there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity together create a colder feeling than what is shown on the thermometer.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, it is still wild nature and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, one must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how calm they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they did not keep the proper distance. These are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals, so give them the necessary space.
You also need to know that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook strong-smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The infamous maritime standstill of 1889 occurred in the port, where seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All ships except one British cruiser sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the freedom struggle led by the Mau movement, one peaceful gathering in the city ended with the killing of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is surrounded by two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay (in the north) to Devonport (in the south).
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most offer shade from tall iron myrtle trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive street are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the elite suburbs of Mission Bay, and in the central Auckland area of St Heliers.
These are family vacation beaches that are sometimes overcrowded and lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, which has a taste that is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. The name of the other local beer is Manta.
There may be many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly suitable for drinking, but if you are concerned, bottled water is also easy to find.
For Australians, "flat white" coffee is an unfamiliar concept. "Short black" is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with a heap of cream (not foam), and tea is offered without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the coral reef throughout the year, and it is rare for any of them to cause damage to the coral reef.
Nevertheless, heed the authorities, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety-related warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of a town named 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides the traveler with peace of mind that they have a place to sleep upon reaching the destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but through the travel agency, you can find other accommodation options, such as campgrounds.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer or obtain other documents for the destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes and requests should be discussed with the tour operator first, not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on-site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you have to arrive early to get a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that although the main stages may no longer be playing music, the festival may have other stages where music plays until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites designed for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check where your cabin is located, as passing through ice creates quite a lot of noise for nearby cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Usually, casinos strive to keep guests there as long as possible and spend as much money as possible. Typically, there are no windows and clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings so that the guests are in a good mood and do not leave.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know that it is important to stay sober.
Everyone traveling at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive the same way as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to get stranded.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues mostly continuously throughout the year.
Africa's biggest tourism attraction is probably safaris, which are the highlight of the trip for many visitors.
The popularly used term "safari" refers to overland journeys with the aim of discovering African wildlife, particularly the savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to the cars, and standard equipment is sufficient for observing them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and they are easier to see with binoculars.
A safari walk (also referred to in English as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a couple of hours or several days.
The Paralympics take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events are held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, where the 1964 games were held, will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation rules do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to take place.
The price of most tickets is expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥13,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for borrowing, even if they are not in your room.
If an iron is not handy or if you don't wish to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if it is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it needs to be done for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not known in their home area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases create allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties at certain locations.
In countries with high taxes, travelers can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont introduces the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through landscapes with secluded forest thickets.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive attentively: steep slopes, narrow roads, and sudden bends are common.
The speed limits are significantly lower than in preceding and following sections - usually 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) - and adhering to them strictly is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, however, the mobile service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, such as in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are rather rich and varied, resembling those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being baked into pastries all year round, while cherries and plums make their appearance in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some rich and hearty baked goods, try the pastry that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.

Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines that can be found across the country, allowing for selection from among 17,000 islands.
But when it is used without additional modifiers, the term tends to refer to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is widely available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the Javanese people's favorite condiments.
The stirrups hanging on each side of the saddle are meant to support the rider's feet.
They help the rider maintain better balance, but they can be dangerous because the rider's feet might get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag them along while running away. To reduce this risk, precautions should be followed.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have protective guards that allow the stirrup leather to come off the saddle when a falling rider pulls it backward.
In the Cochamo Valley, Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, there are various granite big walls and rock formations.
From the mountain ridges' peaks, breathtaking views unfold. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes on these cliff faces with endless potential.
Mountain snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered surface on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski-bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing is very old – skiers are depicted in cave drawings dating back to as early as 5000 BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport was practiced as early as the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first amateur skiing club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called wilderness skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them. Alpine skiing or mountaineering is usually done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than walking, but despite the maintained trails, you will very rarely achieve a cross-country skiing speed similar to skiing without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it has many independent countries. Generally, passing through several countries means having to apply for a visa multiple times and going through passport control.
However, in this matter, the Schengen zone operates somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can basically cross borders without going through passport checkpoints again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are older than 100 years.
The definition varies in different geographical regions, for example, in places like North America, the age limit might be shorter than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be called antiques, even though they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for many Sámi people, and the culture related to trade is also important for many other professionals.
But even traditionally, not all Sámi were engaged in extensive reindeer herding; instead, they lived mainly from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sami work in modern commerce. In the Sami region of Lapland, tourism is an important source of income.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially by those who are not Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and an inaccurate perception of the Roma ethnicity.
If there are travel advisories for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may want to consult with a government other than your own, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
As an example, American citizens may face different situations in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
State travel advisories are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather conditions is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruptions, or take lives.

Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of all severe weather hazards affecting the area, as it may impact travel plans.
Everyone planning a trip to a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for a hostile environment course will likely result in the address of a local business.
The course usually deals with the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually along with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 3–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about the sustainability of wild nature are common, but publications about war zones are few.
Passengers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender marker (X), or documents updated to match the desired name or gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints have become much more thorough since September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not expect to pass security checks without their privacy and dignity being affected.
In the case of backflow currents, the flow of water rebounds from the shore, often from a ledge or something similar.
Due to underwater landforms, the returning water flow moves into a couple of deeper spots, and there a rapid current may form that heads towards deeper waters.
Most deaths are caused by the exhaustion that occurs when swimming against a current, as it can be an impossible task.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming back is not more difficult than usual.
Try to move somewhere where it won't drag you along again, or if you don't have enough skills and you've been noticed, you can wait for a rescue team.
The shock associated with returning comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter there), lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Passengers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their local culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture habits.
At first, people were likely patient and understanding with the foreigners arriving, knowing that travelers need time to adapt to the new country.
People may not foresee that returning travelers might need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
Before the performance begins, you will see pyramids in the dark and can view them in silence.
Usually, the voices of tourists and traders can always be heard. Sound and light tell a story just like a storybook.
The Sphinx has been made the backdrop for a spectacle and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated with lights.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases – 16 active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, with a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a notable natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plateau, then rise again and form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica — the Vinson Massif — are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 meters high.
In remote locations where there is no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone because to make a phone call, you need to be outside, in an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used by shipping, including cruise ships, but also expeditions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about establishing a connection with this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before going to university without negatively affecting their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can improve your chances of continuing higher education in your home country.
An enrollment fee is generally charged for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. This so-called land of a thousand lakes also has a thousand islands, located in both lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht to travel between archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks provide a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
The indicators are similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a unique phenomenon (e.g., in the Netherlands this number is one in forty).

Some sightseeing brochures highlight the German city of Berlin. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located anywhere near the sea and visiting this city is not included in the price of the sightseeing trip.
Traveling by airplane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and various backgrounds, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had traumatic incidents in the past.
There is no need to be ashamed of it, as it is no different from the personal fears and aversions many people have towards other things.
For some, understanding the principles of how aircraft work and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on ignorance or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of packages. Often, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies, there have been issues.
When things were shipped by air, it could take days on some routes for unloading and clearance through customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to fork out a big pile of money for this luxury (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
But it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class and 11 times more for first class compared to regular economy class!
In general, it is not even worth looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of fliers who are willing to pay a large amount of money for the luxury of flying somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.

In the metro, announcements are regularly made only in Catalan, but an automated system informs about unplanned disruptions in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
It is a common opinion that Parisians are self-centered, arrogant, and full of themselves.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as politely as possible, conducting oneself like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person. This makes getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians' blunt attitude quickly disappears if you show basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mainly with beeches, spruces, and firs, and there grows a mixture of mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkably wide diversity of plant species due to its various microclimates, soils, and altitudes.
