This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers like birds, a theory already suggested, but also provides details that fossils normally cannot give, such as color and a three-dimensional representation.
The scientists say that the feathers of these animals were chestnut brown at the tips, with a shade of orange on the inside.
The discovery also gives insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Like the feathers of dinosaurs had a very developed shaft, called rachis, but other types of feathers called barbs and barbules, researchers hypothesized that the rachis was a newer development in the evolution of these other feathers.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for regulating temperature and for displaying them to other animals. The researchers say that even if this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of a large bird, not of a small one.

In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's 'sitting group' with a total running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers from the women's sitting group could not finish the race, and 45 out of the 117 total giant slalom skiers were unable to place in the competition.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen computer and the phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her computer and phone."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite three people being inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver had serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya is in the Edinburgh sheriff court accused of the murder of the son.
He is under arrest awaiting charge and trial, but any eyewitnesses may be compromised because his image was too widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates in a different manner and the courts viewed the publication of potentially damaging photos.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says that “it seems that journalists are crossing a dangerous line by publishing photos of the suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is comprehensively in charge of the accusations, indicated to the journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the accusation.
The document, according to the tip, talks about the border dispute, which wants Palestine to the base of the borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
Other topics likely addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence only for five years.
The shooters in the supplemental disinfestation process had to be closely supervised by the rangers, while the process was being monitored and the effectiveness was being assessed.
In a collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited into the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the interim director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NPWS, the four shooters taken for the first shooting operation received complete safety instructions and training.
Martelly took the oath to join a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine counselors yesterday.
It is the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEO in a package of measures to bring the country to elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests sometimes turned violent due to the inability to organize the elections, some of which were supposed to be held in 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPods were reported that overheated, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said that they are aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 other overheating incidents that the company called "not serious."
The minister responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report “very regrettable.”
The earthquake shook the Mariana Islands at 07:19 in the morning local time (09:19 in the evening GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Agency of the Northern Mariana Islands says that there were no reports of damage in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that no sign of a tsunami was seen.
A Filipino man who was formerly a policeman hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, taking Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages were recovered and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Afterwards, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
He took the same path as his father, working in medicine.
He specialized as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm labor during his free time.
Their research has shown that administering a hormone accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs of the baby.
Xinhua said that the government investigators found the flight recorders "black boxes" on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was crazy like me... maybe even more... I loved her and I will miss her... maybe she is in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who were against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34 percent of those interviewed think the same, that they want Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the survey's extremes, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medals had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays of the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his well-being was put into question.
I couldn't take the medicines that were needed to relieve the pain because they are banned by the Games.
On June 25th, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software from the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets perhaps were a source of distribution of water on Earth with other organic materials that formed the proteins and support life.
The scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed when comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, started the government at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriages.
He called the gossip "political chatter and nonsense".
It's thought that he will run as president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to take shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It uses a technology based on satellites as opposed to the old technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to track aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
They are not adding other means of transport and the overhead trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and the parking and interchange facilities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match might be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science spoke about the birth of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that nine species evolved in two generations, despite this process normally taking much longer, due to the reproduction between a Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the large cactus ground finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any type of shape. It can be fashioned into small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wires, then it can be spun and twisted. It can be beaten or worked into thin sheets.
It can become very thin and is placed over other metals. It can become so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate the hand-painted images in the books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical product.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and then, with dry and clean hands, form a ball.
The humidity of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which become strange and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, the transmission of the signal is done through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it downwards, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet (30 meters) high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel did for us is to provide easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and other means of transportation.
Under these, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then, there are many small cats (including house cats) that eat many more small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche, a special work that every cat has that keeps it away from competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are made up of one to three fully grown and related males, along with about thirty females and young ones.
The women are usually related to each other because they are a big family of sisters and daughters.
The lion prides behave very much like wolf or dog packs, animals that resemble lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and they are very deadly for their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger knows how to climb (although not well), swim, jump, and lift with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but like a phrase of angry and shouted words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, smelling where they were on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with night vision, and they move very quietly as well. The owlets hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then jumping on it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population where they come from (such as if they go over a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island and therefore cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, thus the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to those that were needed before.
The original population did not change at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations become so different that they can no longer be said to be of the same species.
This process we call speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale (which means release with their breath).
The plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We deal with our things with the plants and we make things from plants. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaurus was a top predator of its time, with the only thing that could scare it being other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, plus others in reserve, meaning that there was no way for what was caught to escape.
It's not certain, but it could have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, possibly they were cannibals.
He was quick to attack anything that entered the water; even a dinosaur as big as a T. rex couldn't do anything against him.
Even though almost everything the Romans ate we could recognize, the Romans also held banquets that might seem a little strange to us: they ate wild boars, turkeys, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate seated on chairs, the rich men liked to have their banquets where they lay reclined on a couch while they ate their meals.
The ancient Romans did not have food that came to Europe from the Americas or later from Asia.
For example, they didn’t have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cacao, and no Roman of those times had ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, considered the house of that deity.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to understand the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special tower structures shaped like pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
At the top of the tower, there was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The major part of the life of the Jewish family was spent outdoors.
The women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were open counters that extended into the street. For building the houses, stone was used.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was colonized with lower density. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even if every nation was from Scandinavia, there were many differences among the people, the kings, the traditions, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence there was painted a treasure map.
Anyway, it wasn't true. Even if there's something written behind the document, it's not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th June 1776." The text appears at the end of the document, upside down.
Nobody knows for certain who wrote it, but it is known that when it appeared, this large parchment document (measuring 116 centimeters by 96) was rolled up to be preserved.
Therefore, it is also possible that the annotation was added just as a label.
The arrival of D-Day and the battles that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy". These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the allies invaded the south of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the American forces and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture that belongs to a large number of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civiltàti" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, associated with the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it somehow defines the greatness of society.
City-states are born before nations. A civil culture signifies the passage of knowledge across various generations, a long cultural impression, and a certain broadening.
Smaller cultures often disappear and don't leave certain historical records and cannot be known as true civilizations.
When the Revolutionary War occurred, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government, composed only of the Congress, under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since there was no national or judicial executive, it relied on the state authorities, who often did not assist, to enforce its actions.
It didn't have authority even to remove the laws on taxes and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before being changed and the states had such a low opinion of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, the German national football team, is the second strongest team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most well-known sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, rink hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international games at the Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), so Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Thanks to the groups/clusters of islands, Japan has always been called, from a geographical point of view, an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of the island, starting a transformation in the indigenous production practices of wheat and hiring Chinese workers to work in the sugar and rice fields.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) occupied the coastal areas to the west and north and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the territory of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three structures, which are called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the sides of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was rebuilt, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant dimension when the era of analog film ended.
It was also made today, but above all its appearance-related relationships were taken from the shapes of the digital camera's image sensors.
The format called 35mm is a bit confusing because in reality it is 36mm wide by 24mm in height.
The ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore defined as 3:2.
Many common shapes (such as those of the APS family, for example) are equal to or quite close to this relationship.
The much-exploited and often ridiculed rule of thirds is only a guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It is said that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was brought under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion kept the European nations together, despite their differences in languages and traditions.
He had a power that entered silently and pushed everyone, from the king to common people.
One of the most important principles of the Church is to use wealth to alleviate pain and poverty, and the Church's money is kept for this specific reason.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth led many people to doubt whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated an internationally accepted law codified by a series of international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined the international waters to prevent ships from entering complete sections of the ocean, causing damage to neutral ships.

In the twenties, the predominant attitude of many citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After they saw the horror and cruelty during the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the director of his former work) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Then, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most notable of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms that lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods there were savage wars among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the most important throne in the great palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Later, after the revolution, the positions were open to all male candidates and allowed success to those who were more ambitious and fortunate.
The same applied to the military because now the military ranks were based on merit and not on class.
The French Revolution also inspired other oppressed working-class people in other nations to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things other than his own worldly life. He often went to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The very cave, which still exists, gives a very vivid image of the spiritual inclination of Muhammad.
At the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the world.
Indeed, it is not easy to find it even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can't see anything except for a beautiful and clear sky above and the mountains all around. Inside the cave, you see and feel little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian valley of the dead, contains various pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), some small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol of the "arch upwards" resembles a V and the symbol of the "arch downwards" looks like a clip or a square without the base.
Supra means starting at the tip and pushing down, and sutta means starting at the base (where your hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
A bow upwards generates a more delicate sound, while a bow downwards is stronger and more decisive.
You can write your notes with the pencil, but remember that the signs of the printed sheet music are there for a musical reason, so they must be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse who was 11 years old and Louis Charles who was 4 years old), and the king's sister, madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789, had to return to Paris from Versailles because of a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled toward Paris chased by a crowd that shouted threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and the queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At a certain point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard of Versailles in front of the startled queen.
The costs of the war of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippine islands were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to support most of the expenses and interests of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the super profits that came from the continuous exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the foundational gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The years in which the events occurred are commonly referred to as the "High Middle Ages," the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
The term technological determinism can mean many things in practice, from technological push to technological imperative, meaning that the fate of humans is inevitably associated with scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
There are two general ideas that many interpretations of technological determinism share: that the development of technology itself does not depend on cultural or political influence; and that technology has "inherent" effects on societies, rather than socially conditioned effects.
Suppose that one could say that the invention of motor vehicles forced the development of roads.
Nevertheless, a national highway network is not something that can be economically made just for a few cars, and for this reason, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
Nowadays everyone has a car. This causes more accidents on the roads, and therefore new techniques are invented in medicine to help people who are injured.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, thought of by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, the habits and cultures tied to that geography arose, and these, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, and likewise Constantinople was the fashion capital during the time of feudal Europe.
It is known as the epicenter of luxury, starting in the year 400 BC until the year 1100 BC.
Its importance declined in the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts like silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Originally, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
In any case, due to slow communication channels, the styles in the west were delayed by 25 or 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of those times, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the agriculture done to produce sufficient food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses seeds saved in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase production.
Historically, many farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming and this still happens in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel alienated from society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic of the era, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture so distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which includes fashion, manners, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take as a basis the unfortunate cases of children who, due to abandonment, misfortune, or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Certain wild children were abandoned by people (usually their parents); in certain cases, this abandonment of children was caused by the parents' rejection of a child with severe mental or physical problems.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that some were raised by animals; it is said that others spent their lives alone in nature.
If he is raised only by animals, the wild child has behaviors (within physical limits) like those of the animals that raised him, such as his fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, but immersive learning takes it a step further.
Assessment is not a method for learning, but a support that provides assistance to those who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The mentors can be virtual or real: a teacher can be a form of mentoring, but the same applies to the little paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual tutors are integrated into the software and have the function of assisting, encouraging, and observing processes that may be too difficult for a student alone.
The children are given into foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse or mistreatment.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and educational, but they do.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The placement is meant to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken and brought away.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The Internet has particular characteristics that lead to reaching other dimensions for managing uses and satisfactions.
For example, "education" and "socialization" can be important reasons to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) found two new ideal aspects: "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships," when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to many important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Above all, it is said that one can discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless assess sincerity in the right way.
Also suggest that these skills in interpreting human behavior are also possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two groups for each generation.
Outside of the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs by taking them from the available plant resources.
Then, the inability to do it has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily accessible plant resources were the proteins available in leaves and twigs, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, the animals that are eaten (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a lot of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" like chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
The interruption of sleep is a process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a little while (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a slightly silent alarm clock to give you awareness without waking you up completely.
If you notice that you change the alarm clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm suggest drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a diuretic) before sleeping, so that one has to wake up to urinate.
The greater the amount of inner peace of a person, the lesser the amount of tension in the body and in the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded through the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is composed of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) awakens through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Divinity. Through visualizations of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War and led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the contrasts in the system, process, and culture led to the division of the States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years and was truly fought by representative armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize in front of the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Russian Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and merchandise across the ocean.
The job of the navy is to ensure that the nation maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time impairing the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
In the meantime, the German navy, using only U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient farmers and tribes began to keep them to have milk, wool, meat, and easy hides.
The domestic goats were usually kept in the flocks that roamed in the hills or other pastures, often the flocks were kept by shepherds who were often children or young boys, they were like the most famous shepherds. These ways of keeping the pastures are still used today.
The carriages were built in the 16th century in England.
Even though the carts were made of parallel wooden planks, the horses could pull them and thus they carried greater loads and went faster compared to those slightly more rough roads of that time.
The wooden crossbars began to be used early to keep the wheels straight. Gradually, they realized that the wheels would have been more efficient if they had had a strip of iron on top.
It became a common thing, but the iron caused much more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first railway made entirely of iron appeared.
The first means of transport was walking; humans began to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
The specialization of bipedalism is found in the fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but the Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more amicably with the environment, we can join the movements for the environment, and we can also be activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
This is only a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed due to human technological and scientific advancements, and problems have become bigger because of overpopulation and the peculiar lifestyle of the people.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent some buildings further ahead to the printing office of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap copies".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 copies of Dunlap that are known to still exist are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and walk with two rear limbs like the T-rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use the technical jargon of computers.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. The symptoms, like vomiting, are too generic, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open box of medicines or household products that contain toxins.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists formally use the term bugs for these groups of insects.
This word is used because they are related to the bed bugs, which have adapted very well to infest humans.
Assassin bugs and even those found in beds are nidicolous, which means they nest either in nests or where their hosts are.
In the United States of America, there are almost 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), so it is the most widespread neurological disease among adults and young people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal column, and the optic nerve.
The research found that women are twice as likely to have MS compared to men.
A spoon can decide that raising a child is not its business or doesn't make it the child's business.
These cooks can choose an adoption plan for the foster child.
In adoption, biological parents lose parental rights so that another family can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works with the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides a large part of scientific research.
It's not the only one: experimentation too, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations guide scientific research.
The naturalist and philosopher adhered to classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's thoughts on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greek language was lost, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed that physiological rhythms and behavior often depend significantly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions and external periodic signals, have been documented for almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was a major implication that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments tagging either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacterium with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the type of genetic material affected, or if the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only the mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to the children, while the mutations in other parts can cause the death of the cell or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people passionate about visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, plants, and wild animals.
Some examples of local activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and learning things about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the countryside towns by car to go to work and meet other people who work in the place they left from.
This means that everyone is tied to a transportation system that is based on private cars, and thus they make it grow.
Science now says that this great coal economy has changed the biosphere from one of the stable states that helped human evolution in the past two million years.
Everyone is part of a society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaint are heard for water quality or for falling bridges.
Why are the transportation systems so often criticized, and why do they fail every day? Are all the transportation engineers inept? Or is there something more important going on underneath?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with others.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because drivers' behaviors cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, it seems that drivers behave reasonably; therefore, the traffic flows tend to have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, the relationship must be established among the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This type of relationship helps in planning, designing, and operating state services.
The insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly helped them to escape from predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage of knowing how to fold their wings behind the body.
This gives them many more places to hide from the predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Someone thought they were right but many people thought the opposite: that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, even the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible because the Earth doesn't seem to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water that the second largest river carries.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at certain points it is up to six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the freshwater that flows from the plains into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon river is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their dimensions and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the least population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by almost everyone who works for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
These were much more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, so he also theorized that they change with new substances to create what we see.
Compounds are basically a mixture of two or more elements. One must not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Certainly, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be compounds that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as newer writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a status and use that was lower.
People now send messages on the computer screen, without needing to resort to a pencil sharpener anymore.
One can only wonder what a keyboard will become when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Sharing the burden and then relaxing a little bit of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus which means it has to split with little or no urging.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is finer under the seas and denser under the mountains.
There can be more seas on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theories of content are focused on discovering what makes people angry or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires that become internalized as they grow and become adults.
These theories look at what certain people have that makes them want to do the things they do and what things in their environment make them do certain things or not.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Speaking in general, when directors begin to lead those who were once their peers, two behaviors may appear. One part of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (like kids).
This type of management has difficulty making unhappy decisions, taking disciplinary actions, evaluating performances, assigning responsibilities, and maintaining the reliability of people.
On the other side of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels they have to change everything that the team does and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often becomes a disruption among the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must maintain the same levels of excellence as traditional teams, but there are a few differences.
The members of virtual teams often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often they have more autonomy than members of conventional teams because their teams can meet while being in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also the unique component of a virtual team.
The "visible team" is the management team that every member reports to. The visible team decides the requirements for each member.
Why would an organization want to go towards a time-consuming process to set up a teaching organization? One of the objectives of putting organizational teaching concepts into practice is innovation.
When all applicable resources are successfully used within the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
As a result, the process of working together in an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead the new innovative process to serve the needs of the customers.
For an organization to be innovative, whoever is in command must create a culture of innovation, spread knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the approach of the continuum as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Thus, it refines and gives more precision to the research area.
The correlation between mental pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors influence behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows for the observation and study of brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the internal processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong connection to science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation within a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and organization, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as the recognition of writing, voice, and face.
These things became separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to everyday life problems.
The NA system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and is also built into various home computers and applications for video game programs.
School trips are important for this kind of class. Often, teachers like to take the students even on trips that cannot be made by bus.
Technology provides the solution for virtual trips. Students can look at the artifacts in museums, go to the aquarium, or view fine arts while they are seated in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Each year, the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website dedicated to the trip they take to the capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as sketches.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with shaky grammar and writing, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since the students are often the most critical audience, the blogger is starting to want to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging then "forces students to become more proficient about the world around them." The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be more intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to increase learning even beyond traditional school days.
The appropriate use of the blog "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their position in the context of other writers as well as define their own perspectives on a particular issue (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the beautiful bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further to the South, there are the Niagara Falls and to the North are the natural beauties of Muskoka and others still.
All these things and others underline that Ontario is considered the "substance" of Canada by foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost wild, uninhabited lands.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wild animals.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are famous as luxury vacation resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which took hold strongly in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
In the north, the region is connected with the Sahel, while in the south and west, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advised that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their true marital status.
Just dress well (but not in something that looks too expensive).
Women should consider that cultural differences might make certain things seem inappropriate to them, but there it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You have to be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to be on your own (cultural differences or not, it’s not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to buy things in all of Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easier to find places that sell typical Moroccan products, such as tagines, vases, leather products, hookahs, and a whole series of trinkets, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far East, towards the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered the majority of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Even though Goma is quite secure, visits outside the city should be made to investigate the state of the fighting that continues in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing up Mount Nyiragongo or to begin one of the least expensive hikes in Africa to go see the mountain gorilla species.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The regular (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the shortest ride.
Together with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite having a reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major topics during the PBS special by Henry Louis Gates The Wonders of the African World.
The city is in clear contrast with the rest of the cities of the country, because it has more of an Arabic style than the African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, and each one has its own wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions of South Africa and is considered the pride of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As for all the National Parks of South Africa, there are fees and daily entries for the park.
One could also benefit from buying a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider as the main point.
The array of constructions that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a shining strip that is evident with the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
To have the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the other side at Kowloon beach.
The majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is very populated on the reclaimed lands on the north coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of India and Bangladesh.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by bodies of water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a natural sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 chitals in this area.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, and more so, especially those going to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang, another one departs at 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The majority of the districts are served by small Japanese tourist buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means for traveling to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It is located over the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checks are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that lived in the current eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, like the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, initially called "The great province of the Indians," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay managed to preserve much of its character and identity.
Argentina is known because it has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, you can also follow the tournaments and the less important matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and to find out where to buy tickets for the polo matches, ask the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), with a value equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West Store.
English pounds are usually accepted on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and American dollars are often accepted as well.
In the more remote islands, it's likely that credit cards are not accepted, even if British and American currencies may be; check with the owners in advance to find an acceptable payment method.
It is practically impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months, it is common to have temperatures above 30°.
The winter can be cold in a deceptive way: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There are no seasons where "it rains too much" or that are "too dry": the amount of rain is the same throughout the year.
Even if most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities advise staying at least 100 meters away from bears and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
Even if they seem harmless, bison, deer, moose, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of tourists get injured because they did not keep the right distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they must be given their space.
Remember also that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that has a smell and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just over 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa starting from 1959.
The port was where a naval standoff took place in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for an English ship. Almost 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful protest in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is located between two harbors. The busiest ones are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour area) are in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay, in the north, down to Devonport, in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where you can swim without dangers, with pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are above Waitemata Harbor, in the affluent neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the center of Auckland.
I love that the beaches are full of families and there are many shops to buy what you need near the sea. You can swim peacefully.
The most important local beer is called “Number One”. It's not a complex beer, but it is good and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines to try, but it is easier to find wines from New Zealand and Australia.
The water from the tap can be drunk without problems, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A normal short one is an "espresso", the cappuccino is served with a lot of cream (without foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Trips to the bullfighting arena are organized throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these bullfighting events are rare.
Anyway, follow the advice of the authorities, respect the signals, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The common dolphins are found near beaches and the estuaries of rivers from October to April north of the 1770. During these periods, they can sometimes be found out of the water.
There are sharks that rarely attack humans. The majority of sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Marine shrimp do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in the river estuary north of Rockhampton.
If they book in advance, tourists can be assured of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often offer deals with specific hotels, even though it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, always through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other necessary documents for your destination (such as a visa).
All changes or requests had to be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For certain festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp there, and many participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to arrive early to find a spot to settle near the music.
Remember that even if the music in the main parks is over, there can be sections of the festival that continue to make music until late at night.
Certain festivals have special activities for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Arctic in the winter, check the position of the cabin, because passing through the ice produces a sound quite horrible for the more sensitive people.
The cruises to St. Petersburg plan to spend a little time in the city. The cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirements (check the terms).
It is known that casinos try everything to increase the time and money spent by guests. Generally, there are no clocks hanging and no windows, and finding the exits can be difficult.
To keep the guests happy and prevent them from leaving the facility, casinos usually offer good special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment.
Certain places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when one is drunk, they do not reason well, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Those who have to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very cold temperatures.
On icy roads or with snow, the traction is low and you can't drive as if you were on normal asphalt.
During snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall in a short time, causing you to be stuck.
Even visibility can be reduced by falling snow, sleet, or ice on the car windows.
Piero, the conditions of ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without interruption all year round.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important moment for many visitors.
The word "safari" in popular use refers to journeys overland to see the extraordinary African animals, especially in the savanna.
Certain animals, like elephants and giraffes, have the tendency to approach the machines and, with the appropriate equipment, can be observed well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are seen better with a telescope.
The walking safari (also called "forest walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") is a walk of a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics were held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events took place in other cities throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics (the first were hosted in 1964).
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in a complicated situation.
The cancellation policies can be different, but starting from the end of March, most of the cancellation policies for the Coronavirus do not cover until the end of July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is said that most tickets will cost between 2500 and 130000 ¥, and the cost of standard tickets is about 7000 ¥.
Ironing wet clothes can be useful to dry them. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and a board even if they are not present in the room.
If the iron is not available, or if you are not interested in wearing pressed pants, you can use the hairdryer, if there is one.
Be careful not to heat the fabric too much, because it might shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
There are many different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In certain areas, boiling the water for a minute may be enough, while in others more time is needed.
The effectiveness of filters can vary and, if you have doubts, consider buying bottled water from a reliable company.
Travelers can encounter animal parasites that they do not know in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, emit poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can wound or kill people by force are usually not classified as parasites.
Buying in duty free is a way to purchase goods without taxes and tariffs in certain places.
Travelers heading to countries with heavy taxation systems can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol or tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents more challenging driving conditions than the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, because it passes through many isolated wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: there are many hanging hairpin turns and narrow roads and curves.
The speed limits are lower than those of the preceding and succeeding sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is very important to comply with them.
Strangely, here the mobile phone service works better than in other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Sweet things with fruit are common, especially those with apples that are found all year round, and those with cherries and plums that are available in the summer.
Many German sweet things are also made with almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. The most famous cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try something small and sweet but very tasty, try the one that depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the quantity of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet."
In the northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and in certain other regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, the cuisine of Indonesia is a general term to indicate a great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
But, if used without other adjectives, this term tends to indicate the original food from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, the cuisine of Java has dishes prepared with simple ingredients. The predominant flavors favored by the inhabitants of Java are peanuts, little peppers, sugar (mainly Java cane sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the feet of riders that hang down from the sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider, but they can have safety issues because the rider's feet can get stuck.
If a rider gets thrown from the horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse continues to run. To reduce this risk, various safety precautions can be taken.
To begin with, the riders wear riding boots with a heel and a sole that is quite narrow and smooth.
Then, some saddles, especially those English ones, have safety bars that make the leather stirrup fall if it's pulled backwards by the rider who falls.
Cochamó Valley: the main climbing destination of Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a great variety of granite walls and cliffs.
From the peaks, many beautiful panoramas can be seen. Climbers from all parts of the world continuously climb new routes in the infinite potential of their walls.
The sports of descending on snow, which include skiing and snowboarding, are famous sports that involve descending on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan vacations solely to ski in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very ancient: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 some Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
It is similar (but usually does not include) to alpine skiing or mountaineering, which are practiced on steep terrains and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a hiking path.
In good conditions, longer distances can be covered compared to when walking on foot, but only very rarely can the same speeds of cross-country skiing be reached without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel from one country to another, you would have to apply for visas each time and go through passport control.
In this sense, the Schengen area functions as if it were a single country.
Provided that you stay within this area, usually you can cross the borders without going back through passport control.
In the same way, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa to enter each member country of the Schengen area separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that states that handmade objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define as antique those objects that are more than 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Craft objects can be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
The herding of reindeer is an important means of sustenance for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for others who do different jobs.
Piro, historically as well, not all Sami have always herded reindeer, but for their livelihood, they engaged in activities such as fishing, hunting, and the like, and used reindeer as draught animals.
Today many Sámi have modern jobs. Tourism is a very important resource in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Even though it is quite used, especially among those who are not Romani, the term “gypsy” is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you want to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel insurance or trip cancellation may change.
You can also see the warnings of different governments from that of your country, even if these warnings are intended for citizens of the respective country.
That is to say, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations compared to European or Arab citizens.
The warnings are just a summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often summary, general, and very simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found in other sources.
“Adverse meteorological conditions” is the general term used to refer to dangerous meteorological phenomena that can cause damage, serious social problems, or loss of human lives.
Bad weather can occur in all parts of the world and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of bad weather, such as downpours, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
The phenomena of regional and seasonal bad weather include snow blizzards, storms, ice storms, and dust storms.
It is advised for travelers to be informed about the risks of bad weather in the area they want to visit because travel plans might change.
Whoever plans a trip to a country that might be considered a war zone must receive professional training.
Searching on the Internet for "Course for useful skills", perhaps one can find the address of a local business.
The course covers all the issues described here in a much more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
Usually a course lasts 2 or 5 days and includes role-playing games, many first aid notions, and sometimes even weapon use training.
The books and magazines that talk about how to survive in the wild nature are common, while there are few publications that talk about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex change operations abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to prepare passports where the gender is not indicated (X) or documents updated according to a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is also very variable.
The searches at security checks became even more invasive after September 11, 2001.
People who are undergoing gender reassignment must ensure that they pass the security checks before the operation so that their privacy and dignity remain intact.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves that break on the shore, usually near a sandbar or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections where a fast current towards deeper water can form.
The majority of deaths depend on exhaustion, because they try to swim back to shore against the current, which is impossible.
Once you manage to get out of the current, swimming towards the shore is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move towards a place where there is no longer any current or, depending on your capabilities or if someone saw you, you can wait for rescue.
The return shock comes even before the culture shock (because there are not many sweet moments), it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When someone returns home after many years in another country, having adapted to the new culture, they realize that they have lost a bit of the customs of their original culture.
In the early periods abroad, it may be that people were patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country had to acclimate.
People don't even imagine that they could show patience and understanding to travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you hear the voices of tourists and vendors. The history of sounds and lights is like that of a book of tales.
The Sfinci is the basis and the storyteller of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the highest number of bases, with 16 of them being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
The other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano still creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula join here with the plateau and then reemerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains range, 360 km long and divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, with Mount Vinson reaching 4892 m.
In isolated places, where there is no phone coverage, a satellite phone is the only option.
The satellite phone is not an alternative to the cell phone, because to make a call you have to be outside and clearly see the satellite.
The service is often used on ships, including boats for personal use, and also on expeditions that go far, where internet data and connections are needed to make these long-distance calls.
Contact the local telephone service provider for more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people who plan a gap year is to travel and learn new things.
This option is especially popular for graduates who take a year abroad before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a one-year course abroad can offer more opportunities to start university education when returning to one's own country.
Usually there is a registration fee to pay to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is a beautiful place to travel by boat. The "land of a thousand lakes" is full of thousands of islands, both in the lake areas and the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and the lakes, sailing with a yacht is a luxury.
Even though the archipelagos off the coast and the larger lakes can accommodate all types of yachts, the smaller boats and even kayaks can offer a different experience.
Sailing is one of the national pastimes of Finland, so much so that there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
These numbers also exist in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but we are talking about a unique situation (consider that the Netherlands counts one for every forty people).
The majority of Baltic cruise itineraries include a long stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
It means that it's possible to visit the historic city for a couple of days while sleeping on the ship.
If you reach the land with organized shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
In the cruise advertisement Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned. As seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and the visit to the city is paid separately from the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a very terrible experience for people of all types and ages, especially if they have never traveled before or if they have been victims of a traumatic experience.
There is no need to confront each other: there is no difference with other fears and dislikes for other things that are quite common to many people.
For some people, knowing a bit about how the airplane works and what happens while it is flying can be helpful to overcome the fear of things that are unfamiliar or that cannot be controlled.
Delivery companies are well paid to make fast deliveries. Often, time is important with business documents, goods, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
For a short period of time, the largest companies are the owners of the planes, but for other routes and for the smaller companies there were problems.
If things were sent by air, on certain routes it would take days to unload them and carry out customs checks.
The only way to send the goods faster was to send them as luggage on the plane. The rules of the airlines do not allow sending luggage without passengers, and that's where you come in.
You need money to pay for the privilege of flying first class or business class (it would be better to let them go out to the main one).
Don't think it's something you can buy for two lira: generally, you pay up to four times the price of a normal ticket for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it does not help to look for discounts for first-class or business class seats on direct flights that go from point A to point B.
The airline companies know that there is a certain group of passengers willing to pay a higher price to be able to travel faster and more comfortably, and therefore they make them pay more for the ticket.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also used a lot.
Murdavia is a multi-ethnic republic where there have been ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN countries.
The economic connections were re-established between these two parts of Moldova even if the political negotiations were not successful.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million people, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an important transportation center.
Formerly called Smyrna, it is now a modern and lively commercial center, situated by a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The large streets, the glass buildings, and the modern shopping centers are mixed with the buildings with traditional roofs made of red tiles, the 18th-century market, the mosques, and the old churches, even if the atmosphere of the city resembles more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a peculiar octagonal church.
In the church courtyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on top of coffins.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk in the village.
To the north and not too far away is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, famous among foreigners thanks to the beautiful stories of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus number 403 goes to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, where there were various apparitions of the Madonna.
Remember that you are visiting a place of common graves, apart from a place that has a significance that cannot be calculated for a large part of the world population.
There are still many men and women who survived the time that passed here and many others who have their own loved ones who were killed or who worked here until they died, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not deface the place with writings or drawings on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
Pirò, the majority of the signs are written only in Catalan because by law it is the first official language.
And also, Spanish is widely used in public transport and in public offices.
The normal announcements on the metro are in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced with an automatic system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being egocentric, boastful, and arrogant.
Even if this is a wrong stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as best as one can, like someone "bien élevé" (well-raised, with good manners). This way, living in this city becomes much easier.
The cold appearance of the Parisian changes quickly if you show some basic courtesy.
The Plitvice National Park is full of forests, especially of beeches and firs, and the vegetation is a mix between Alpine and Mediterranean.
The great variety of plant communities is mounted, due to the many microclimates, different terrains, and various levels of altitude.
In this area, there are also many species of animals and birds.
And there, rare animals can be found such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and must also cover their shoulders.
The majority of monasteries give scarves to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring one yourself, especially a colorful one, the nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Even men have to wear things that cover their knees.
You can find these for rent at the entrance, but since they're not washed after each use, you might find it uncomfortable to wear them. One size fits all!
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and where available uses olive oil.
A simple popular meal, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and other toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All the names, together with the word “Sie”, which means “Your Grace”, always begin with a capital letter, even if they are found in the middle of the sentence.
This is a very important way to recognize certain verbs and objects.
It probably simplifies reading as well, even if the writing is complicated because it needs to be understood if a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because almost all the words are read as they are written.
One has to be careful with the letters “c” and “g”, because the pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
One must be careful to pronounce differently the single consonants and the double ones, as they can change the meaning of the word (like saying "caro" and "carro").
The grammar of Persian is quite easy and without many exceptions.
So, by reading this basic grammar manual, you can already learn a lot about Persian grammar to better understand the sentences.
There's no need to say that if you already know a Romance language, it becomes easier to learn Portuguese.
Pirò, people who know a little bit of Spanish might quickly think that Portuguese is quite similar and that there's no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and remain as museums or educational places.
As light pollution in the past was not the same problem as today, it is usually found in cities or university campuses, and it can be reached more easily compared to those that were built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Watching the blooming of cherry trees, an activity known as “hanami,” has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms are the preferred blossoms.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the cherry blossom were organized by the emperors only for themselves and certain members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants do well if they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one" specimen.
If one is visiting an Italian garden and picks a specimen, they are immediately expelled.
Singapore is usually a very safe and easy place to navigate, where you can buy everything as soon as you arrive.
But since it is located in the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, it is hot (always) and there is strong sun (when the sky is clear, much more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional place where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and that it does not stop in the Jewish city of Kiryat Arba.
The inland rivers can be an interesting topic for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire valley, in the Rhine valley or taking a cruise in interesting cities of the Danube or on the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions of this holiday were also adopted by non-believers in both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake outside to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches hold an Easter vigil on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend and organize midnight celebrations to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the distance from the continent, the mammals did not succeed in completing the journey and the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, because the sky is always dark throughout the day.
Since there is little population and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to the Western one.
The attire is formal business style and colleagues are addressed by surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental. Teamwork is praised instead of praising the results of individual people.
Employees often have to receive approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make and have to obey the instructions of their superiors without questioning.
