This not only confirms a hypothesis that many people are already aware of, which is that at least some species of dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides detailed information that fossils cannot indicate, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists believe that this species' fur is chestnut brown on top and grayish-blue or yellow/orange underneath.
This discovery also provides an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed rachis feathers, which are called feather shafts, but had other feather characteristics—filament and down—the researchers suggest that the feather shaft may be an evolutionary development that came later with these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that this plumage was not used for flying but for controlling body temperature or for display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows mature feathers rather than down feathers.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult bird and not the feathers of a chicken.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The work completed is mainly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team is looking for will be created by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts gravitational forces on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant "has a very high level of concern and alarm due to its very high casualty rate."
Doctor Moll believes that some patients may have contracted bedbugs in the hospital and at least two people are medical staff in the hospital.
Within a year, an infected person can transmit the disease to 10 to 15 people in close contact.
However, the rate of XDR-TB among the total number of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; only 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected at any given specific time in South Africa.

In France, voting has long been a task that does not require high-tech: each voter enters a private voting booth, puts the paper with the pre-printed name of the candidate they choose into an envelope.
After the staff verify the identity of the voter, the voter will place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict in systematizing procedural processes.

Candidates may send representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, the ballots will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following a special procedure.

Her other race, in the Giant Slalom skiing event, saw her finish in 10th place in the women's rankings with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Australian athlete Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers on the team did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom event did not secure a place in the rankings.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have caught the five individuals who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her phone and laptop."
The suspects prosecuted are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police commander Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed in, no one was injured.
However, the driver survived despite having a severe head injury.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services have freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later convicted in Edinburgh District Court of murdering her son.
She is currently being detained awaiting charges and trial, but all witness evidence could be compromised because her images have been widely published.
This practice is very common in England, but Scotland is different; the laws and courts here have deemed the distribution of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "perhaps journalists are indeed treading a dangerous path when publicly sharing images, etc., of suspects."
The Prosecuting Agency, overseeing all aspects of prosecution, informed reporters that there would be no comments at least until the indictment.
The documents, according to the leak, will mention the border conflict, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reported to have been discussed include the future status of the holy city of Jerusalem for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continued presence of its army in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a presence for five years.
The hunters in the pest control pilot program were closely monitored by rangers because the pilot program was supervised and evaluated for effectiveness.
Under the cooperative agreement between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's personnel search program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of the NPWS Parks and Wildlife Conservation Agency, the four shooters chosen for the first round of shooting were comprehensively trained and instructed on safety principles.
Martelly was sworn into the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), consisting of nine members, yesterday.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council established by Martelly within four years.
Last month, the presidential committee petitioned the provisional Electoral Council (CEP) to resign. This petition is part of a package of measures aimed at transitioning to a new election period for the country.
This order is Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests since October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from the failure to organize elections, some of which were supposed to take place since 2011.
According to reports, there have been about 60 cases of handheld iPod music players overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that they have become aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported to them an additional 34 overheating incidents which the company described as "not serious."
In response to the announcement, the ministry called the temporary postponement of Apple's report a "very unfortunate" incident.
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 GMT, on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs indicating the appearance of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took some tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking the bus carrying them in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Like the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Later, photographers took the place of the elderly woman when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland from 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating the condition of premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that if injected with a type of hormone, the rate of fetal lung growth will be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had recovered the two 'black boxes' of the plane on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also expressed their gratitude to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna is the First Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night with two moons. Unique just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is just as scary as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election program said she believed that Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of people in the poll share this view; they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the poll, 29% of participants believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is expected to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but according to his complaints, his physical condition is not assured.
He cannot use medication for pain relief because those drugs have been banned from use in the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri who discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Some individuals verified the discovery with various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have once been a source of water for Earth along with organic materials capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth was formed, as comets have collided with Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began serving as governor at the beginning of this year. Last month, he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political gossip and madness."
There were once rumors that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is the system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and providing pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport measures are being deployed, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities in the area.
Concerns about a lack of transportation options have raised the possibility that the match may have to be played behind closed doors without this team's fans.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday about the formation of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to take longer, due to the combination of Darwin's finches, the Geospiza bird species, and the migratory Geospiza birds.
Gold can be crafted into all kinds of shapes. It can be fashioned into objects of very small sizes.
Can be drawn into thin strands for twisting and braiding. Can be pounded or rolled into sheets.
It can be beaten very thin and plated onto other metals. It can be beaten so thinly that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books known as “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH level of the chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the experimental chemical.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two pieces of dry dough together, then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers to create a strange feeling and shape into a type of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
The remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes a part of public baths where both men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive calls and then bounce them back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images we observe.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing that the wheel has brought to life is helping us travel and transport much more easily and quickly.
It brings us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
At a lower level are medium-sized species of the cat family, hunting medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cat species (including domestic cats) that prey on large numbers of small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that each cat has to avoid competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social type of cat, living in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males along with about thirty females and their offspring.
Women often have close relationships with each other in a family with many sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in terms of behavior, and are also very dangerous to prey.
Like a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, leap far, and pull with a force five times the pulling strength of a healthy person.
Tigers are in the same group (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger does not resemble the roar of a lion, but rather a series of growls in its throat.
Ocelots eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if possible. Most of the animals ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that South American wildcats track and find animals to prey on through scent, sniffing each spot where the prey has stood.
They can see very clearly in the dark with night vision and move skillfully, unnoticed by anyone. Wild cats hunt prey by camouflaging themselves into their surroundings, then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small number) separates from the main population (such as when they cross over a mountain range or a river, or travel to a distant island from where they originated making it difficult for them to return), this group of creatures will often be aware that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they previously were.
The initial population did not change at all, they still need adaptation like before.
Over time, as the new group of residents began to adapt to the new environment, they started to look less and less like other groups of residents.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable and extremely important consequence of evolution.
Trees produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (which is exhaling).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator during its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw holds more than 70 razor-sharp teeth along with an additional set of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing can escape its path.
We are not sure, but it might have a forked tongue. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might even be a predator.
It also attacks everything in the water; even gigantic dinosaurs like the T. rex are no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans shared bizarre or unusual feast dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, the rich prefer to host parties together and recline to relax while eating.
The meals in ancient Rome did not feature foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god and regarded it as the home of that god.
People will bring offerings to present to the deities, and the priests will try to meet the needs of the deities through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an outer courtyard area, and inside is a sanctuary that only the priest has the right to enter.
Sometimes towers with a special pyramid shape, called ziggurats, were constructed as part of temples.
The pinnacle of the tower is a special sanctuary for the deity.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not too important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time living in the open space.
Women cook in the yard; newly opened stores overlook the street. Stone is used to build houses.
There are no large forests in the Canaan region, so wood is very expensive here.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse mythology tells that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for manslaughter, and while heading west, he discovered Greenland and named the land Greenland.
But regardless of his discoveries, the Eskimo tribes lived there at that time.
Although they are all 'Scandinavian' countries, there are still many differences in people, monarchs, customs, and history among Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." This phrase appears at the very bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one is certain about the author of the document, it is known that in the early days, this document, written on a large sheepskin (29¾ inches long and 24½ inches wide), was rolled up for preservation.
So, there is a possibility that annotations can be added simply as tags.
The Allied forces' landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
This area was governed by the French "Vichy" Government. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched "Operation Dragoon," invading southern France.
In just two weeks, the United States military forces and Free France liberated the south of France and then turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a prominent culture shared by a large group of people living and working collectively, a society.
The word "civilization" derives from "civilis" in Latin, meaning pertaining to people, related to "civis" in Latin, meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also somewhat defines the scale of society.
The city state is the precursor of nations. The culture of civilization contains the transmission of knowledge through generations, a cultural imprint that remains and is well popularized.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving substantive historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the initial thirteen states formed a loose central government - with only Congress as the sole component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress does not have any power to impose taxes, and since there are no national executive or judicial branches, they have to rely on the authority of the states, which often do not cooperate, to enforce any decisions.
It also does not have the authority to amend tariff laws or tax schedules between states.
The charter requires consensus from all states before being amended, and the states disregard the central government to the extent that state representatives are frequently absent.
The Italian football team, along with the German football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions with Italians competing on the international stage and at the Olympic events.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu Island), Japan becomes the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to having clusters/groups of islands, Japan is also often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan originated in the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern region of Taiwan, beginning to change the grain cultivation practices of the local people and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice fields and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been restored to help visitors better visualize their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most popular still photography format in the world is 35mm, the film size prevalent before the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor format of the digital camera.
The actual dimensions of the 35 mm format are 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format sets) are equivalent or approximately close to this aspect ratio.
The much-ridiculed and abused rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while still being used as a measure of order in a photograph.
According to this rule, the most effective position for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to come under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has become the connecting link between European countries, despite differences in language and customs.
Its comprehensive power has affected everyone, from royalty to commoners.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the funds contributed to the church exist for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money leads many to question whether the aforementioned doctrines are being followed.
After hostilities broke out, Britain immediately implemented a blockade against the German navy.
This strategy has proven effective by cutting off military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade violated widely accepted international laws, as established by many international agreements over the past two centuries.
He dropped mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean area, endangering even neutral ships.
There was not much reaction to this tactic. Therefore, Germany also expected to receive a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevalent viewpoint of most citizens and countries was inclined towards pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the devastation and brutality of war through the First World War, nations all wished to avoid a recurrence of that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to take a job at Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with only 4 pennies, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different eras; each phase of China or each family that held power corresponded to a different dynasty.
Additionally, between the dynasties were periods of instability when the regions were divided. The most famous period is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, fierce wars occurred amidst numerous battles between the nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying just to vie for the throne in the grand hall in Xi'an city.
There are many political and social impacts such as the use of the metric system, the transition from an absolute monarchy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to any ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions were opened to all men seeking employment, allowing the most ambitious individuals to succeed.
This is also true for the military because the ranking of the military is based on qualities instead of ranks.
The French Revolution also inspired many people from the oppressed working class in various other countries, urging them to rise up in rebellion.
Muhammad was deeply concerned with issues beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) Mountain to meditate.
Enduring over time, the Hira Cave preserves vivid images of the spiritual trend left by Saint Mohammed.
Situated on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even when people know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
There is nothing but the clear, high, and beautiful sky embracing the mountain ranges. A small world is known and talked about from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures constructed to commemorate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Tombs of Egypt, has many pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx statue.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the consorts and family members of Khufu.
The "crescendo" symbol looks like a V, and the "decrescendo" symbol resembles a staple or a square missing the bottom side.
Up means you should start from the tip of the bow and push the bow upward, and down means you should start from the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downward.
Upstrokes tend to produce a softer sound, while downstrokes create a more powerful and assertive sound.
Feel free to mark, but remember that the printed lines have musical significance, so please respect them.
On October 6, 1789, while at the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and his sister - Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris in fear.
On the horse-drawn carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd yelling and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage window.
There was a person in the crowd who waved the head of a killed royal soldier at the Versailles castle in front of the terrified Queen.
The cost of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the super profits obtained from exploiting the Filipino people over a long period have become the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar organization, one must understand the context that prompted its creation.
The era in which these events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Medieval period occurred after the Early Medieval period and before the Late Medieval period, conventionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in reality, from promoting or compelling technology to the narrow meaning that human destiny is controlled by an implicit logical system linked to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: the development of technology itself follows its own path, uninfluenced by culture and politics, and technology has a "reverse" impact on existing societies, rather than societies conditioning it.
For example, one could say that cars running on engines inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The excessive number of people owning cars also leads to an increase in the number of traffic accidents, leading to new technical inventions in the medical field to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determination, derived from authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes each individual, and over time, the customs and culture related to that area develop, and these combine with social status, which is still better than authoritarian laws being imposed.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of Medieval Europe.
It is famously known as a focal point of luxury, starting from around 400 BC and lasting until around 1100 AD.
The status of this city declined in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the mid-period from the 10th - 11th century to the 14th century.
Initially, the costumes were heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to communication delays, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. The result of the Crusades brought about one of the most important developments at that time: people began to use buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is a type of farming carried out solely to meet the food needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, usually only fertilizing with organic matter, using stored seeds of indigenous plant varieties in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize productivity.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, which is still prevalent in many developing countries.
A group culture brings together individuals with similar thoughts who feel ostracized by societal norms and helps them achieve a sense of belonging.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The factors that differentiate regional cultures may include language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a cultural group often express their relationships through the use of characteristic and symbolic styles such as fashion, manner of speaking, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite a few unfortunate cases of children involving neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse, lacking social contact from caregivers when the child is growing up.
Such children are referred to as "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been kept in captivity by people (often their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child is due to parents rejecting a child with severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Wanderer children may have been cruelly abused or traumatized before being abandoned or fleeing.
A different number are said to have been raised by animals; some are believed to have had to live alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable, the Scaffolding educational method takes it one step further.
Modeling is not a learning method but is an aid for those undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The lesson plan can be in physical or virtual form, in other words, the teacher is essentially a type of lesson plan, but like a small virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual Scaffolds method is embedded in the software and aims to ask questions, remind, and explain the processes that may challenge students to solve problems on their own.
Children are placed in the Alternative Care system for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse or even abduction.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, care, and education, which they are currently experiencing.
We find that the Foster Care System is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide a safe home, dedicated caregivers, a stable educational environment, and reliable medical care.
A shelter is considered to provide what is essential that the children's previous home couldn't offer.
The Internet combines elements of both community communication and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to many new aspects in the way of usage and approach to satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Self-engagement” and “continuous correlation” are also seen as new driving directions according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they conducted an investigation into readers' responses to electronic web pages.
The use of video cameras has brought significant findings in interpreting fleeting expressions, which are movements on the face that occur in just a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is believed that a person can detect someone lying by accurately interpreting each micro-expression.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that these abilities in interpreting human behavior might also appear in other animal species, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: recessive and dominant.
The mutation adds a new genetic variant, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variants.
The separation and recombination occur back and forth between the two groups each generation.
In the desert, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human to meet the requirements for essential amino acids from the available plant sources.
Additionally, failing to implement that will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily accessible plant sources are likely the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides a rich amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
After considering everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a manner similar to today's chimpanzees on the savannah.
Sleep intervention is the process of deliberately waking a person during their normal sleep time and then going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a virtually silent alarm clock to help you wake up without being fully awakened.
If you find yourself frequently resetting the clock when you sleep, you can place it in another corner of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choices based on circadian rhythms, such as drinking a lot of fluids (specifically water or tea, which are known to be diuretics) before sleeping, will make us wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stress that the body and mind endure.
The more tension is reduced, the more positive energy is present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on this path is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is expanded by the Mahayana Buddhist path of compassion and a multitude of Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation techniques, and the path embracing love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chants, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing the forms of different deities, clean energy fields, and chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was once the common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of World War II, conflicts over systems, procedures, and culture caused these countries to be divided again.
In the two years following the end of the war, former allies became enemies again, and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish front line had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops advanced and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is currently the most effective method to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional mission of the naval forces is to ensure the maintenance of the nation's ability to transport people and goods, while also intervening in the movement of enemy personnel and goods.
One of the most notable examples recently is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The United States attempted to transport supplies and provisions across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy also used U-boat submarines to try to block this flow of transportation.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain after having subdued the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep these animals for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats are usually raised in herds that roam freely on hills or other grazing areas, mostly herded by children or teenagers, similar to sheep herding. These methods of raising livestock in herds are still in use today.
The carriage roads were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the carriageway consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull at a faster speed and carry heavier loads than traveling on the rough roads of everyday life.
The tie bar was known quite early to keep the rails in position. However, gradually it was realized that these rails would work more efficiently if there were a small piece of metal at the ends.
This has become customary, however, the iron has caused the horse carriage wheels to wear out faster.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation is walking, which humans began approximately two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus apes, did not walk upright.
The bipedal characteristics are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to lessen the burden on the future to some extent.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and figure out how to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed significantly due to human achievements in science and technology, and the problems have also been exacerbated by overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of humans.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few buildings away.
Between 150 to 200 prints were created overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Broadside".
The first public reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy was sent to London on August 10.
25 Dunlap copies are believed to still be the oldest surviving reproductions of this document. The original handwritten copy is no longer available.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exists to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think this species is a dinosaur because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
Their legs have scales and claws. They lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes.
Almost every computer we use today is based on the transformation of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary sequences - or "bits", used in computing languages.
Internal poisoning may not show clear symptoms immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are often insufficient for immediate diagnosis.
The clearest sign of internal poisoning is likely the presence of an open container of harmful household chemicals or medication.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its official sense to designate this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with the bed bug, an insect highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both blood-sucking insects and bed bugs are species that leave their nests late, adapted to living in nests or living on hosts.
Across the United States, there are currently about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This number has made Multiple Sclerosis the most common nervous system-related disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or that of the child.
These couples have decided to plan to adopt a child.
In an adoption agreement, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world operates through scientific methods. This method has practically guided most scientific research.
However, experimentation and empirical study are not the only types of experiments used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions and making observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly the Latin Bible.
Acceptance is Aristotle's view on all issues related to science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek origins of philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior often heavily depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the production of these rhythms through the biological clock.
Rhythmic cycles, not merely simple responses to external rhythmic signals, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator and will continue to run in a free cycle even without external influences.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase is one of the compelling pieces of evidence showing that DNA is a type of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label the DNA strands inside the bacteriophage with a radioactive phosphorus compound or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Gene mutations can cause various effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the impacted gene segment, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell or not.
Only mutations in the bacterial germ line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts visitors who are interested in exploring natural areas in order to immerse themselves in the natural scenery, along with plants and wild animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and researching information about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to go to work and pass by others who are heading to the very place they just left to work.
In the dynamic shuttle transport system, everyone is connected to and supports a separate car transportation system.
Today, science suggests that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has helped humanity evolve over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system cause complaints, why do they frequently make mistakes? Is it that the transportation engineers are not qualified enough? Or is there a more fundamental reason at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within appropriate ranges; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better simulate traffic flow, the relationship between three main characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly into the air. The ability to fly allows them to evade predators more easily and search for food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
Thanks to that, they can hide in small places to escape predators.
Nowadays, the types of insects that cannot fold their wings are only dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people think that he was right, but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable since we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest in the world. It carries eight times the amount of water compared to the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with times when it is as wide as six miles.
20% of the water that flows from rivers on this planet into the ocean originates from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramid complex could never surpass their size and perfect construction techniques.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the works of their ancestors that still stood thousands of years later.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. This is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is used as an everyday language by people working in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humanity has known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all these elements can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything is composed of a combination of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that thousands of billions of atoms could be only as large as a period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, from the very first days of its creation, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerge, pencils gradually lose their standing and are used less and less.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens and never have to use a pencil sharpener anymore.
One can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer appears.
A fission bomb operates based on the principle of using energy to combine atomic nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Divide one more time and then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the maria (seas) and thicker in the highlands.
There may be many basins affecting the adjacent slope because the crust is thinner. Lava rises more easily to the surface.
Content theories focus on understanding what captures people's attention or attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires acquired externally as they mature.
These theories consider what motivates some people to do what they want and what factors in their living environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theoretical concepts are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviors that may arise when a manager begins to lead their former colleagues. The first approach is to try to maintain close relationships.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, assessing performance, delegating responsibilities, and keeping people working responsibly.
Someone will turn into a completely different person and feel they have to change everything the whole group is doing and do it themselves.
After all, the leader must bear absolute responsibility for the success and failure of the group.
This action sometimes leads to a rift in the relationship between the leader and others in the team.
Remote working teams must meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are still small differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as points of contact for real team members who are close to them.
They often have more autonomy than regular members because their team can meet on different schedules, which might not be sympathized with by their local management.
The presence of the “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special component of the virtual team.
"The invisible team" is the management team to which each member will report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why must an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One objective of bringing organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed.
Therefore, the process of organizing to work together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new improvement process to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be creative, the leadership needs to create a culture of creativity as well as share the collective knowledge and exploration.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuous method is a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research process.
We have long known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain neurological functions.
The development of new technology allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the brain processes.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) holds great significance in the science fiction genre, AI also shapes an extremely important branch in computer science, handling behaviors, with the ability to learn, be perceptive, and simulate intelligence in machines.
The study of Artificial Intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become their own rules, focusing on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
Today's AI (artificial intelligence) systems are commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as well as in many home computer applications and video game software.
The field trip is an important part of the class. The teacher quite often takes the students to places where taking a bus is not an option.
Technology provides solutions through virtual reality trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the camping trip online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina will design a website about their trip to the State Capitol. Each year this website is redesigned, but the old versions are still kept online as memorabilia.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. When they begin blogging, these students often make grammar and spelling mistakes due to carelessness, but the presence of readers generally changes that.
Students are often the most critical reviewers, so the blog author started trying to improve the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The necessary demand to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to become intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the confines of traditional classrooms.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more astute in their analytical and reasoning abilities; through positive interactions with online materials, students can identify their role in the context of others' writings and express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, home to a series of art galleries and museums displaying historical and modern artifacts of Canada.
Further to the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka with its pristine natural beauty and more.
All of this and more highlight Ontario as what outsiders view as the essence of Canada.
The large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some regions are almost uninhabited wastelands.
A comparison about the population may surprise many people: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands belong to the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest area and the continent dedicated to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This area is bordered by the Sahei to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female travelers should say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing rings will also have an effect (only the types that don't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to a situation that they consider harassment and that following, grabbing arms, etc., are very normal occurrences.
Show a decisive attitude when refusing, and don't hesitate to stand your ground (whether cultural differences exist or not, that doesn’t turn wrong into right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and only abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Kingdom of Morocco rebuilt this city like Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders, who established trade bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop across Morocco.
Around the old Medina area, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan shops selling items such as Tagine pots, ceramics, leather goods, Shisha, and various trinkets, but these are only intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was leveled by the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcanic eruption disaster buried much of the city, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is still within the permissible safety limits, all visits from outside this city still need to be thoroughly researched to understand the combat situation currently existing in this North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest Gorilla tracking equipment in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to explore Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for that short trip.
With its relatively inaccessible characteristics, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for distant and exotic lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation attracts tourists who visit, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to desert sand encroachment.
It is one of the main stops in the special PBS television program Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which is home to a wildlife ecosystem.
This is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and it is considered a flagship location of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, conservation activities take place daily, and an entrance ticket to the park must be purchased.
It is also beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, as it can allow you entry into either the parks in South Africa or all the National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many visitors consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings makes Hong Kong's skyline reminiscent of a shimmering bar chart clarified by the presence of the clear waters in Victoria Bay.
To see Hong Kong from its most beautiful angle, leave the island and head straight to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong's urban areas are concentrated in reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists took over as their own, and thus, if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a very good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and India from the coastline.
The Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forest area within Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
Not only do they have mangrove swamps, but these forests also include some remaining areas of the magnificent forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although mainly, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, will depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by the small Japanese Coaster buses, which are very comfortable and reliable.
Ride-sharing taxis are a convenient and quick way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. This bridge spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters tall, 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.5 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't until March 2017 that the bridge was opened to traffic.
The bridge is expected to officially operate in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are completed, as planned.
The Guaraní are the largest indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, with a lifestyle of semi-nomadic hunting and self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region has other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged following the encounter between the conquering Spaniards and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has strived to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also take place here at other times of the year.
For information about the tournament and where to buy polo match tickets, visit the Argentinian Polo Association's website.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
Currency exchange can be done at the only bank on the island, located on Stanley Street opposite the FIC West store.
In general, the British pound will be accepted anywhere in the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely to not be accepted, although British or American money might be; check with the owner beforehand to know which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside of these islands, so make sure to exchange the money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer there is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures are often above +30°C.
Winter can be cold in a misleading way: temperatures rarely drop to freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There is no distinct "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall throughout the year is almost unchanged.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wildlife and should not be fed or teased.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all wildlife!
No matter how gentle they appear, bison, moose, elk, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists get injured because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are very large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their own space.
Additionally, be mindful of scents that might attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking strong-smelling foods and maintain cleanliness around the camping area.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the conflict for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the death of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) belong to the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are safe sandy beaches for swimming and most have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with many shops along the coast. It is a safe place to swim.
The local beer is mainly 'Number One', which is not a mixed beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wines that you need to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be less affected when moved.
The local tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but bottled water is also very easy to find if you are concerned about this issue.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A Short black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has the top covered with cream (not foamed), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate according to Belgian standards. Expensive but wonderful fruit juice.
There are many tours to this coral reef throughout the year, and injuries caused by this coral reef are rare.
However, follow the government's recommendations, comply with all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of area 1770. Occasionally, they can also be encountered outside this time.
Sharks do appear but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not often live in the sea; their main habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance helps travelers feel assured that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel agencies often associate with certain hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination of airfare and hotel.
They can also hold the spot for you if you need time to consider the job offer or handle other documents related to your destination (such as a visa).
However, any request or adjustment should not be sent directly to the hotel but must first be handled through the travel agency.
For some festivals, a large number of attendees decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the area where the event is taking place, you need to arrive early to secure a camping spot close to the sound system.
Remember that although the music on the main stage has stopped, there are still some areas of the festival that will continue to play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check your cabin, as the icebreaker will create terrible noise that not everyone can endure.
Travel time of the Saint Petersburg train includes time spent in the city. Passengers on the train are exempt from visas (check terms and conditions).
Casinos often try to encourage guests to spend as much time and money as possible. In these places, there are usually no windows and clocks, and exits are also very hard to find.
They often provide special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers comfortable and staying.
Some venues provide on-site alcoholic beverages. However, getting drunk impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers understand the importance of keeping a clear mind.
Anyone who wants to drive in high areas or over passes needs to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction on the icy and snow-covered road surface is low, making it impossible for you to drive as if you were driving on a normal asphalt road.
If there is a blizzard, even a short period of snowfall is enough to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be restricted due to falling or blowing snow, or condensation or ice forming on the car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal phenomena in many countries, and transportation is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the most tourist-attracting destination in Africa and a highlight for many travelers.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to overland travel to observe wildlife in Africa, especially in the Savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles, and with just ordinary tools, we can easily observe them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be very cautious, so to see them more clearly, you should use binoculars.
A walking safari journey (also known as "recreational forest trekking," "exploratory hiking," or "adventuring") includes walking and hiking for several hours or days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at different venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in a dilemma.
Cancellation policies vary. However, as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not allow extensions until July 2020 - the time when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with regular tickets priced at approximately ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if you don't see one in the room.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't like wearing socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (it can cause shrinkage, or in severe cases, it can catch fire).
There are many ways to filter water, among which there are very effective methods to eliminate specific risks.
In some places, it only takes one minute to boil water, while in other places it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you have concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they have never seen in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can cause injury or kill by force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from value-added taxes and excise taxes at certain locations.
Tourists visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The long distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through lonely, dense forests.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, you should be prepared for steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limit prescribed in this area is significantly lower than the sections of the road before and after it - with common speeds falling around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these regulations is extremely important.
Strangely, naturally, the mobile phone service is much stronger here compared to many other extended areas along this route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.

The stirrups are tools that support the horse rider, hanging down from the saddle to both feet.
They provide greater stability for the rider but there may be safety concerns due to the potential to trap the rider's legs.
If a horse rider falls but gets their foot stuck in the saddle, they can be dragged if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, a few preventive measures can be taken.
First, most horseback riders wear boots with high heels and smooth, rather narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety bar that allows the leather strap to fall away from the saddle if the rider falls backward.

It is related, but usually does not include the Alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a skiing journey like a hiking journey.
In favorable conditions, you will cover a greater distance than walking – but it is very rare to achieve the speed of cross-country skiing when you are not carrying a heavy backpack and are skiing on a flat path.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Typically, traveling through multiple countries means having to apply for visas and have your passport checked multiple times.

Similarly, by possessing a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.

A rip current is a stream of water that flows back from the waves crashing onto the shore, usually found at reef strips or similar places.
Due to the underwater terrain structure, rip currents concentrate in some deeper areas, and fast-flowing currents to deep water can form there.
Most of the deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which seems almost impossible.
As soon as you get out of the whirlpool, swimming back will not be more difficult than usual.
Try to swim in a direction where you won't be carried away by the current, or choose to stay still and wait for rescue, depending on your own skills and whether anyone notices your dangerous situation.
