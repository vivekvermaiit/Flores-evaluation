The things that happen due to having specific cycles often appear in both physical and mental patterns. These are known as the intrinsic cycles within our body, which are regulated by what we call the biological clock.
These are not just present due to external cues, but are found in many specimens, including bacteria, fungi, and in plants and animals too.
The term biological clock implies that an organism can self-regulate, so even without an external controller, it is able to continue maintaining precise rhythms on its own.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is important as it demonstrated that DNA can be the material for inheritance (genetic material).
