He made a WiFi bell for the door, he said.
Siminoff said that the number of items he was selling went up when he appeared on an episode of the Shark Tank program, where the people on the show did not want to give him some money to help his business.
Near the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on QVC, a television channel for selling goods.
Also, Ring had given money to a security company, ADT Corporation, which was trying to take him to court.
A medicine that they are currently testing reduces the number of people dying from Ebola. Until now, there has been no medicine that clearly shows it can cure this disease.
A treatment using antibodies, named ZMapp, has shown that it can cure the disease, but later studies have found that it cannot prevent people from dying in the way they initially thought it would.
When they conducted a test called PALM, ZMapp was used as a 'control', meaning the scientists used it as a 'baseline' to assess how the other treatments performed compared to it.

This shows that indeed some dinosaurs had feathers like birds, an idea many people have, but this provides information that fossils cannot give, such as color and 'three dimensional arrangement'.
Scientists say that the color of the fur of this animal is 'chestnut-brown' on top with a 'pale' or 'carotenoid-colored' on the underside.
This research also provides some insights into how bird feathers develop.
Because the feathers of birds in dinosaurs do not have a 'well-developed shaft', which they call a 'rachis', but they do have two other features in the bird feathers— 'barbs' and 'barbules' — the researchers concluded that this 'rachis' developed later in the evolution of these feathers in birds that existed in dinosaurs.
The structure of these bird feathers shows that their function is not only for flying but also for regulating body temperature and displaying their color to others. The researchers believe that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the 'sample' indicates it belongs to a large dinosaur and not a juvenile dinosaur.
The group leading this research thinks that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it indicates that feathers on large dinosaurs were not as abundant as the feathers on young dinosaurs.
A bomb was in a car and exploded at the large police office in Gaziantep, Turkey on Monday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the people who were injured are police officers.
Police say they suspect that a soldier of Daesh (ISIL) was responsible for this incident.
They discovered that the Sun has the same big ideas as other stars: This activity of all the stars in the system they discovered is described as 'luminosity' and 'rotation', which causes them to turn, and there is nothing else again.
These 'luminosity' and 'rotation' are used together to find the Rossby number of a star, and this has a relationship with 'plasma flow'.
If the Rossby number is small, the 'magnetic reversal' of this star will not be very active.

The 802.11n standard can operate on two frequencies, 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz.
This allows it to work backwards with 802.11a, 802.11g, and this can happen if the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of 802.11n exceed those of the previous frequencies, and the maximum mark of theoretical throughput is 600Mbit/s.
Duvall, he is married and has two big children, and he does not make Miller happy, which this story talks about.

This work was done to come up with some concepts, but they wrote this program to show the things they observed in the Sagittarius 'galaxy'.
The thing that this team is trying to find is the force of attraction between the 'dark matter' of this 'galaxy' and the 'dark matter' of the Milky Way 'galaxy'.
Just like the moon has a force that pulls the earth towards it, causing tides, the Milky Way also has a force that pulls the Sagittarius galaxy towards it.
The scientists cannot come to an agreement that 'dark matter' interacts with other 'dark matter' in the same way that all 'matter' does.
This scientific concept says that a lot of 'dark matter' in the 'galaxy' surrounds the 'galaxy' like a 'halo', and it contains many 'small particles'.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered this Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In one interview, he said that this new 'variant' has "caused great trouble and fear because many people have died."
It seems like some of the patients got this germ at the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and two of them are staff members of the hospital.
Within one year, a person who is sick with this disease can transmit it to 10 or 15 people who are close to them.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within a group of people with the disease 'tuberculosis' is below 60.00 out of 330.00 people who usually get this disease at one time within South Africa.

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine that the government promised to provide will prepare health agencies to carry out their work in the coming new year.
The plans to deliver these vaccines to areas with a history of high outbreaks of pig disease this year have not materialized because there is not enough money, and they do not consider it a major issue when compared with other diseases.
In 1956, Slania moved to Sweden, and three years later he started working at the Swedish Post Office and became their 'chief engraver'.
He produced more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
His work is of such good quality that many people recognize it and that he does things differently from any other "reputable person in this field" among the philatelists. Some even specialize in collecting his works alone.
The stamp number 1,000 is really excellent "Great Deeds by Swedish Kings" which David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl made in 2000, and it is included in the Guinness Book of World Records.
They also hired him to do engravings on the banknotes of many countries, and some examples of his work are the portraits of the Prime Ministers that are on the front of the new $5 and $100 banknotes of Canada.

The fire rescue workers got this fire at 11:35 pm.
When they finished building this 'dam' in 1963, the floodwaters that occur usually cause the land to spread to all areas where the water stops.
These lands form sandbars and beaches, which often serve as habitats for various wild animals.
Because of this, two species of fish have become extinct, and two others are close to extinction, one of which is the humpback chub.
Even though the water level will rise by a few feet after the tidal wave, the officials want it to be enough to place sandbars in areas where the water usually flows down.
There was no tsunami warning issued, and Jakarta's geophysics agency said that no tsunami warning would be given because the earthquake did not reach the magnitude of 6.5, which is the threshold for issuing a tsunami warning.

In France, the method of 'voting' does not involve technology: voters usually go to a table, place a pre-printed piece of paper showing which candidate they want to choose into an envelope.
When the officials have checked the name and place of this voter, the voter will put the envelope into the ballot box and mark his or her signature on the list of people who have come to choose their candidates.
The law of France regarding elections states that they must put 'codes' in the process of selecting candidates.
Starting from 1988 up until now, all 'ballot boxes' must be in clear view so that both the voters and those overseeing the vote can see that there are no envelopes present at the beginning of the vote and no other envelopes are added on top of the envelopes that have already been counted and all come from authorized voting officials.
The candidates can send their representatives to go and witness each stage of the process. In the afternoon, the volunteers usually count the votes and there are people who follow the procedures to supervise their work.

This 'controller' looks like a 'remote controller' for television, this 'controller' uses two 'sensors' that are near the television of this 'user' to perform 'triangulate' in 'three dimensional space'.
This will allow players to control actions and movements inside the video game as they move.
Giancarlo Fisichella could not control his car and stopped the race shortly after the race started.
One member of his team, Fernando Alonso, was at the front all the time during the race, but he stopped the race when he made a 'pit stop', it seems this happened due to a front wheel that was not fitted properly.
It was not long after Alonso that Michael Schumacher retired from the race, because his suspension got damaged while he was fighting to gain position in the race.
"He looks really nice and also, he can sing well," he said in a 'news conference' recording.
I always feel something whenever we practice this, I feel it inside my heart.
About 3 minutes into the time they sent it to space, a camera attached to it showed that pieces of the insulation foam were starting to break off the fuel tank.
However, they don't think that this thing caused the damage to occur on this 'shuttle'.
The boss of NASA's shuttle program, N. Wayne Hale Jr., said that the foam fell "after we have spent a lot of time thinking about it."
Five minutes into the display, a flare started to blow, and one minute later, the wind reached speeds of 70km/h... then the rain came, but it poured down very heavily, and the raindrops were so large they hit your skin like needles, then hail started falling from the sky like stones, people were scared, shouting and running on top of one another.
I lost my sister and her friend, and when I went to the place, there were two groups sitting in wheelchairs, and people were jumping over them and just pushing them around," Armand Versace.
NHK also reports that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata province is operating well.
Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reports that there are no signs of an earthquake and that the Number 1 and Number 2 reactors located at the Shika nuclear power plant are shut down.
They reported that almost 9400 houses in this region do not have water and about 100 of them do not have electricity.
Some of the roads have been damaged, there is no train service in the areas affected by the earthquake, and Noto Airport in Ishikawa province is still closed.
A bomb exploded outside the governor-general's office.
Three more bombs exploded near the government buildings within two hours.
Some reports say that the number of people who have died is eight, and reports coming from the offices say that 30 people have been injured; but the true number is not yet known.
Cyanuric acid and melamine were found in samples of the urine of pets that died after eating this animal feed that was contaminated with poison.
These two compounds react together to form crystals that can block the kidneys from doing their work, the research leaders at the university say.
The researchers found that these 'crystals' form in the urine of cats when they introduced 'melamine' and 'cyanuric acid'.
The composition of this crystal is similar to that of those found in the urine of animals that ate this food when analyzed using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but many of the goods coming from Central America enter the country 'duty-free'.
However, the cost of freight for our goods is subject to tariffs imposed by the countries of Central America.
I can't fully understand this; it's not right.
I want to tell everyone that you should treat us the same way we have treated you.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill making it a law to prevent people from selling, renting, or giving fighting games to children.
This 'bill' says that video games involving fighting that are sold in California must be marked with a 'decal reading' "18" and those who break this law must pay $1000 each time they break it.
Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, gave a statement in the morning which announced that they will prosecute Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne is resigning and Ed Davey MP will take his place in the Cabinet. Norman Lamb MP will take on the role of Business Minister that Davey will leave.
The time for Huhne and Pryce to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court is on February 16.
The people who died were Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was driving the car.
Edgar Veguilla was injured on the upper arm and the jawbone, and Kristoffer Schneider will need reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's attempt to fight was unsuccessful when he pointed his attack at the head of the fifth man. Schneider feels pain, one of his eyes cannot see, and parts of the bones in his head and face are made of 'titanium'.
Schneider gave a testimonial on a video at a USAF center in his country.
After the race that took place in Trente, Carpanedo played solo in two other races at these Championships.
His first race was in Slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of 116 participants ended with the same result in that race.
Her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished in tenth place in the "women's sitting group" with a run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place woman, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 behind the ninth-place woman, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
The four women from the ski inside the 'women's sitting group' did not complete their runs, and 45 out of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not receive a 'rank' in this race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police found this laptop and mobile phone that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped this woman from Switzerland and took her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the people who caused this trouble are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that these men covered their faces when they appeared in court.
Fortunately, the three people who were inside the house when the car crashed were not injured.
However, the car's driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where this 'crash' happened was closed for a short time and emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he stayed at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
And then they sent him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court and was charged with killing her child.
He is in custody and awaiting indictment and trial, but one piece of eyewitness evidence cannot change anything because his story has already been published by the news.
This comes from all parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have viewed the publication of photos as something that shows the opinions of some people and it is not true.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said that "journalists could put themselves in danger if they publish photos and similar things of suspects."
Crown Office, which oversees all prosecutions, informed journalists that no further comments would be made until the indictment.
The information released to the public spoke about the conflicts arising at the borders, where Palestine wanted the borders that existed prior to the 1967 Mideast War.
The other topics that this report talks about are the status of Jerusalem as a holy place for both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants there to be military presence in the valley for ten years when they sign the agreement, and the PA agrees to desist from such military use for only five years.
The 'shooters' in this 'supplementary pest control' test are supervised by the 'rangers', because this test is monitored and its 'effectiveness' evaluated by them.
Inside a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the 'hunting program' of the Sporting Shooters Association.
Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage, Mick O'Flynn along with NPWS said that these four 'shooters' who are designated for the first 'shooting operation' have received proper guidance regarding safety and training.
Martelly conducted the 'swearing-in' of nine members of a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) on Tuesday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission made a recommendation that the former CEO must resign as part of the process for the country to move towards new elections.
This commission is something that Martelly established because of the 'anti-regime' protests that are occurring everywhere and started in October.
These protests sometimes result in anger and fighting and they are happening because no elections are taking place, some of which are supposed to happen in 2011.
Approximately 60 reports of iPods that do not work properly because they overheated have been reported, with this causing six fires in total and resulting in four people receiving 'minor burns'.

Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them about 34 more cases of 'overheating', which the company described as "not a big deal."
This minister expressed his opinion when he described Apple's habit of not providing reports promptly as "really not good."
This earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 a.m local time (09:19 p.m GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas office that manages emergencies said that no damage has occurred within the country.
And also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there is no sign indicating that a tsunami will occur.
A Filipino man who used to work as a police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 gun.
They rescued some of the people who were being held, and six of these people died.
Six of the hostages, including children and elderly people with them, were released first, along with the Filipinos who were able to take photos with cameras.
The people who usually take photos with a camera took over the place of an important woman because she wanted to go to the toilet. They shot Mendoza with a gun and he died.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and got a job in the field of medicine.
He received training to become an obstetrician and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When he was working at Liggins hospital, he started conducting investigations into 'premature labour' during his own time.

Xinhua reports that in Trinidad, government teams conducting investigations have found the two 'black boxes' that record information inside the plane.
The other group who usually do wrestling showed their sympathy for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna is the number one Queen of Extreme. She is my number one manager. Luna left us on the night of the new moon. This is something different and typical of her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna could do various things like me... maybe she's better than me... love her and miss her... I believe she's in a good place."
Among the 1,400 people who expressed their opinions before the 2010 election, those who opposed the idea of Australia becoming a 'republic' increased by 8 percent from the 2008 figure.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 government election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II finishes ruling their country.
34 percent of the people in this poll have the opinion that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the 'extremes' of this 'poll', 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should quickly become a 'republic', while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a 'republic'.
This man who won a gold medal will swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints about fitness, they are not sure if he will participate.
He/she was unable to obtain the drugs that he/she needed to alleviate his/her pain because the Games prohibited these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a very large prime number on January 25.
Some people used various kinds of hardware and software from the beginning of February to check if it was correct and they reported on this on Tuesday.
It appears that a comet may have acquired some stuff that produces groundwater along with other organic matter that can create proteins and support life.
Scientists want to clearly understand how planets were formed, especially how Earth came into being, when comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, started his work as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He spoke about empty words as "political rhetoric and the behavior of people who do not have good thinking."
They thought that he wanted to run again to become president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly on shorter routes and save many millions of gallons of fuel each year while reducing the amount of carbon that normally goes into the air.
He/She uses 'satellite-based technology' and not 'ground-radar-based technology' to allow 'air traffic controllers' to guide aircraft properly and provide good information to the pilots.
There is no other transport available on the ground, and the trains that usually run above ground will stop at Wembley, and the park-and-ride facilities will not be operational.
The lack of transport makes it look like this game will be played in an area where no supporters can go.
A study that was published by the [Foundation] in a journal called Science provides information about a new species of bird found on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported on a new species that emerged within two generations, although they believe this process took a longer time. It occurred due to breeding between the Darwin finch of this area, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch that came from another area, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into various shapes. And it can be rolled to form small shapes.
They can pull it and make it into a small wire, which they can twist and tie. They can strike it with a hammer or roll it to make 'sheets'.
They can make it into a very fine powder and stick it to other metals. Sometimes they can make it into very fine powder and use it to decorate pictures that are painted by hand and inside books that they call "illuminated manuscripts".
This is what they call the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how much 'acid' or 'basic' (alkaline) is present in this chemical.
The mark of Hydrogen (this H inside pH) 'ion' inside the chemical they test will show the level of pH.
The 'ions' of Hydrogen are the 'protons' that have had their 'electrons' removed (because Hydrogen 'atoms' have one 'proton' and one 'electron').
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with a clean and wet hand, squeeze them and make a ball.
This water that is on your hand will react with the layers that are outside, which will feel different and form a certain kind of cell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet using water in almost every house, all connected to a different kind of 'sewage system'.
Artifacts from the past that show these 'sewage systems' were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were very ancient toilets in Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman areas, the toilets were part of public bathhouses where men and women would gather together.
When you call some people who are thousands of miles away, you work by using a satellite.
This satellite in space received the call and sent it back down again, immediately.
This satellite is a rocket that has been sent into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and how we see things.
They use a giant rocket that is more than 100 feet long to put a telescope in space.
This wheel has changed the world in various ways. The big thing that the wheel has done for us is it gives us easy transportation that can move much faster.
He/she/it gives us trains, cars, and many other machines for transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including those that we keep in the house) that eat small animals such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of how they thrive is the thing they call 'niche', a special role that each cat knows how to do and it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are cats that like to live with other cats, and they live together in large groups called 'prides'.
The 'pride' usually has one that reaches the mark of three people, including like three women and a child.
The women come from one family, like a big family of sisters and their daughters.
The prides of lions behave in the same way as the packs of wolves or dogs, those animals that are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also they create strong competition with other animals that they prey upon.
A good 'athlete', a tiger can climb (it doesn't climb very well), swim, leap great heights, and pull things with strength that is five times stronger than a man's.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The 'roar' of a tiger is similar to the 'full-voiced roar' of a lion, but it is almost like a sentence from a person gasping for breath when they are angry and shout.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and track other animals to eat (try to eat) when they smell something, they get the scent of where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with 'night vision', and also, they can move very quietly. Ocelots can find their food by hiding with things in the environment and jumping on the animals they want to catch.
When a small group of animals (a small number) leaves the large population they come from (if they move up a mountain or a small river, or perhaps they move to a new island and find it hard to return) they will find themselves in a different environment that is not the same as before.
This new environment has various resources and competitions, so this new population will need different approaches to become stronger compared to their previous state.
This other population has not changed, but they need to make the same changes to their environment as before.
After some time, this new population began to adapt and learn to live in their new environment, and they started to look a little different from the other population.
On and on it goes, and after some thousands or millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they will not consider themselves as one 'species'.
We call this process 'speciation', which means to develop a new 'species'. 'Speciation' is something that we cannot avoid and it is an important part of 'evolution'.
Plants produce oxygen, which we humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which we humans breathe out (this happens when the air we breathe in comes out).
Plants make their food during the day when photosynthesis occurs. They provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Many of the foods we eat come from plants. If there are no plants, animals will not be able to survive.
The mosasaurs were considered the top wild animals during that time, with no other animals capable of preying on them, so they were not afraid of anything. They were only afraid of other mosasaurs.
His mouth contains over 70 teeth that are sharp like a razor, along with another row of teeth located on the roof of the mouth. This means that whatever he encounters will not be able to escape.
We cannot know for sure, but maybe it has sharp teeth. It can eat turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe it can eat humans too.
It (or he/she) can eat everything that goes into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not be able to compare to it (or him/her).
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had foods we do not know or that they used during grand feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another thing that is different is that when people who don't have many things eat their meals while sitting on chairs, wealthy people usually prefer to have large feasts where they can lie on their sides and eat.
The people of ancient Rome did not have food that came from America or Asia, which now exist in Europe several hundred years later.
One example is that they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the people from ancient Rome ever tasted a turkey.
The people in Babylon built a magnificent temple for each of their gods, which they regarded as the house of that god.
People will bring offerings to the gods, and the priests will try to meet the needs of the gods during ceremonies and large religious gatherings.
Each temple has a place to sit outside and has an inside area where only the priests can enter.
Sometimes, special towers shaped like 'pyramids', which they call 'ziggurats', are built as part of the temples.
On top of this tower, there are some special places belonging to this god.
In the hot places in the Middle East, houses are not important.
Many things in the life of Hebrew families happen outside the house.
Women usually cook food outside on the side of the house; the stalls are tables that are open and face the road. They often use stones to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of the Canaanites, so wood was very expensive.
There are not many people living in Greenland. In the ancient stories of the Norse, it is said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland because he had killed a man, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
But never mind if he found this place, there were already Eskimos living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think they wrote a 'treasure map' on the back of the Declaration of Independence paper.
However, this is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of a document, this is not a 'treasure map'.
They wrote these words on the back of the Declaration of Independence document "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". This text is located at the bottom of the document, and it is 'upside down'.
When no one knew who wrote these pieces of text, they understood that when it was still new, this large 'parchment' document (its size is 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled so it could be kept in storage.
Therefore, it looks like this piece of writing they wrote afterward can stand as a 'label'.
The D-Day landings and other battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was not yet liberated.
This area was controlled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made 'peace' with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with those who came to take over their country and did not fight against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies captured the southern part of France, the battle they called "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, American soldiers and the Free French have liberated the southern part of France and are advancing towards Germany.
A 'civilization' is a culture where a large group of people who live and work together share, it is a 'society'.
This portion of speech 'civilization' comes from a Latin word 'civilis', which means 'civil', and it is similar to another Latin word 'civis', which means 'citizen', and 'civitas', which means city or 'city-state', and this also refers to the size of 'society'.
'City-states' are entities that can form a country. Within a 'civilizational culture', people can pass on their knowledge to several 'generations', creating a type of 'footprint' of culture that remains and a way to pass knowledge to others.
Many times, small cultures often disappear quickly and do not leave evidence of their history, and scholars do not view them as true 'civilizations'.
During the time of the Revolutionary War, initially the thirteen states established a central government that was not strong—where Congress was only one component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress does not have the power to impose and collect taxes, and, because there was no 'national executive' or 'judiciary', it could use 'state authorities', who often could not cooperate with it, to enforce its 'acts'.
And also, he/she has no authority to change the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
All 'Articles' require groups to agree in each 'state' before they can make changes, and the 'states' receive 'central government', so the designated groups are not usually present.
Italy's national football team and Germany's national football team are both the second-best teams in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The 'sports' that many people know are 'football', 'basketball', 'volleyball', 'water polo', 'fencing', 'rugby', 'cycling', 'ice hockey', 'roller hockey', and 'F1 motor racing'.
Many people in the Northern regions excel in winter sports, and Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), and this makes Japan rank as number 7 largest island country in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, people call Japan, in terms of geography, an "archipelago."
The existence of Taiwan became known in the 15th century when European sailors came across it and recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a change in the method of grain production when they brought in Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, soldiers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied and took control of the 'western' and 'northern' coastal areas of Taiwan and declared that Taiwan was a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after it lost the fight in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, who governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three large structures which are called Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun, and Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings located on the edge of this structure have been rebuilt to help tourists understand what the structure looked like in the past.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and work continued on restoration up to today.
For example, 'still image photography' format that many people know is 35mm, which is the main size of 'film' after the era of 'analog film'.
They made it themselves today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is the format that digital camera image sensors take and use.
The 35mm format can make people confused; it has 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The 'aspect ratio' of this format (they divide it by twelve to get a small whole-number ratio) and they say this 'ratio' is 3:2.
Many formats that people use (for example, APS family of formats) are identical or nearly identical to this 'aspect ratio'.
This 'rule of thirds' that many people often misunderstand and joke about is a simple 'guideline' for creating a good photo and bringing some order into one picture.
He/She said that a good place for a subject to be, during the time of taking a photo, is in a place where the lines break the picture into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this time, the Catholic Church had a lot of money and power, so they were regarded very highly.
For more than one thousand years, this religion of the Christians united the countries of Europe together, even though they each had their own languages and customs.
This great power of his brings change to all people. Starting from the king and going down to the ordinary people who have no name and status.
One of the fundamental beliefs of Christians is that they must use their money and possessions well to help others who are in pain, hardship, or lack money and food. They believe that church money is meant to perform this work.
Rome has been leading the administration of the Church for a thousand years and a lot of power and money resides in Rome. This has caused many people to be in two minds about whether to accept this belief or not.
Soon after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This plane of theirs is working well; they are delivering important supplies to the military and the people, even though this blockade violates international laws that have been established under agreements for the past two centuries.
Britain placed bombs under international waters to stop ships from entering large sections of the ocean, which also resulted in hostility towards the ships of other nations not involved in the conflict.
Because there was no response to this 'tactic', Germany thought the same thing would happen to their 'submarines'.
In the years of the 1920s, the attitude of the great majority of citizens and countries was to seek peace and unity and to be self-reliant.
The countries have already witnessed the pain, suffering, and madness of war that occurred during World War I, and they want to avoid such things from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from a previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a different way of showing the various periods; each 'stage' of China or each family that held power was a 'dynasty'.
And also, among the different dynasties, there were times when the provinces were independent. One of those times that many people know about is the time of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times, a great fight occurs among many of the families with status and rank fighting for the king's throne.
Three Kingdoms is one of the times of war in the history of Ancient China where many thousands of people died during the battles for control of the leading throne inside the 'grand palace' in Xi’an.
There are many things happening in society and politics such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, and the sense of nationalism and belief in the country as something that belongs to the people and not just to one person who rules them.
And also, after the Revolution, opportunities opened up for everyone to allow people who have dreams and are willing to work hard to pursue the good work that they want to achieve.
This is the same as the military because now they do not receive 'rank' according to their family 'class', but they will receive 'rank' according to their conduct and what they are able to do.
The French Revolution inspired many other 'working class' people in other countries to start their own 'revolutions'.
Muhammad is interested in things that are greater than the things of this life. He used to go to a cave called "Hira'" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) to stay and reflect.
This stone hole, which still exists, clearly illustrates the beliefs of Muhammad.
He is located on top of one of the mountains in the north part of Mecca, this stone cave is hidden from all parts of the world.
Truly, it is not easy to find it or know if it is there. When you are inside this rock hole, you are far away from everything else.
You cannot see anything else but the clear sky, which looks nice and is above, surrounded by many mountains. You cannot see or hear things of this earth when you are inside this stone hole.
'Great Pyramid' at Giza is one of the 'seven wonders' that still stands today.
The people of Egypt built in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the massive pyramid structures that they constructed to honor a Pharaoh who has passed away.
Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has several pyramids (the greatest of all being the 'Great Pyramid'), some smaller tombs, some temples, and the 'Great Sphinx'.
The Great Pyramid was constructed to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the women and family members of Khufu.
This "'up bow" mark' looks like a V and this "'down bow mark'" looks like a 'staple' or a 'square' without its bottom side.
'Up' means you must start from the 'tip' and push the 'bow', and 'down' means you must start from the 'frog' (this is the place where your hand holds the 'bow') and pull this 'bow'.
An 'up-bow' can produce a sound that is softer, and a 'down-bow' is a sound that is stronger and has more force.
You can make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the 'bowing marks' which have already been printed are there for a reason, so you must respect them.
On the 6th day of October 1789, the market women made King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Therese who was 11 years old and Louis-Charles who was 4 years old), as well as the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, return to Paris while they were staying in Versailles.
Inside a carriage, they are escaping back to Paris while a large crowd is angry and surrounding them, shouting and making all sorts of threatening remarks to scare the King and Queen.
The large angry crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their cars open.
One time, a man among a large group of people lifted up and showed the head of a 'royal guard' that they had killed at Versailles in front of the Queen, and she was very terrified.
The cost of the war that the U.S. incurred when it wanted to occupy and take the Philippines was actually paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They forced them to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to provide money for expenditures and interest on the bonds that they used in the name of the government of the Philippines in the banks of Wall Street.
It is true that the big money winds that arise or harm the Filipino people will result in U.S. monetary gains that control other parts of the world.
To clearly understand the Templars, we must clearly understand the backstory that led to the formation of this group.
This time when everything happened is known as the High Middle Ages, this period in the history of Europe during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages, and after it there was the Late Middle Ages, this period ended around the time of 1500.
'Technological determinism' is a term that encompasses various concepts practiced by people, ranging from 'technology push' or 'technological imperative' to an idea that suggests that the way of life of people on earth is to follow scientific laws and develop technologies that follow these scientific laws.
Many of the ideas around the meaning of 'technological determinism' encompass two major concepts: one is that the development of technology follows a path that culture and politics cannot change, and the other is that technology brings about "change" in communities because these practices and thoughts are inherent to people and not driven by technology.
For example, we can say that cars necessitate the construction of roads.
However, a single road that goes to all parts of the country will waste money because there are only a few cars, therefore, new roads need to be developed for cars to lower the price of cars.
When many people have cars, many accidents can happen on the roads, which will lead people to develop new techniques in healthcare to fix injuries to the body.
Romanticism contained a substantial element of 'cultural determinism' within it, a concept that came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Regarding Romanticism, places people come from tend to bestow a certain way of being, and over time, the customs and cultures associated with the place where they reside develop, and these will demonstrate the nature of the people from that place, which is better than laws imposed from elsewhere and used.
Along this path, Paris has become the number one place for various clothing styles in the world today, but Constantinople was the number one city for various clothing styles during the Middle Ages in Europe.
Many people know it because it is the traditional place of a good lifestyle and it started around 400 A.D. and ended around 1100 A.D.
In the twelfth century, its value went down because the Crusaders had returned and brought gifts such as silk and spices. The value of these items was higher than the value of the items that were present in the markets of the Byzantines.
During this time, they took the name 'Fashion Capital' from the city of Constantinople and gave it to the city of Paris.
Gothic style became prominent during the time between the 10th - 11th century and the 14th century.
First, this dress follows the style of the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because communication processes usually take time, Western styles will remain for the next 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, 'western' Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the major developments that came about during this time because of the 'crusades' was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
'Subsistence agriculture' is the agriculture that people practice to produce food for their family's needs.
'Subsistence agriculture' is a system that does not use many inputs, does not use chemicals, and uses seeds obtained from food grown in the region, combining these practices with methods such as 'crop rotation' or other simple techniques to increase food production.
In the past, many farmers practiced 'subsistence agriculture' and this method is still present in many countries that are not yet developed.
Subcultures usually cause people who have similar thoughts and feelings that the standards of society do not belong to them, and when they come together, they create their own identity.
Subcultures can be different because of their beliefs, the place they come from, their level within the community, the place they live in, and their gender.
The things that make 'subcultures' different from each other can be language, style, religion, politics, sexuality, place, or these things combined.
Members of a subculture can show that they are part of it by using a certain style, such as the clothes they wear, the behavior they have, and the language they use.
One of the methods that many people use to show that 'socialization' is important is they use stories of children who have been 'socialized' because their parents were not busy with them, bad things happened in their lives, or people harmed them as they grew up.
This type of children they usually refer to as "feral" or wild children. Some 'feral' children are sometimes kept at home by their parents themselves; at times parents are not concerned with this child because there is something wrong with them mentally or physically.
The 'feral' children are those who have experienced some major damage or 'trauma' before they ran away or their parents were not caring for them.
Other 'feral' children are said to be those looked after by animals in the wild; some are said to live on their own in the wild.
When animals take care of these children, these 'feral' children tend to display behaviors (that they are able to adopt) which are similar to the behavior of the animals that are taking care of them, such as fear or not knowing what to do when they are with other people.
Never mind, 'project-based learning' makes the process of learning become easier and stimulates interest, 'scaffolding' does even more things.
'Scaffolding' is not just a method of learning something, but it is a support that provides assistance to individual students who are learning something new, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can occur on a computer or can be found inside the classroom, in other words, a teacher is a scaffold, but a paperclip man inside Microsoft Office is also a scaffold.
The 'scaffolds' in the computer are inside the 'software' and their job is to ask questions, give instructions on what to do, and explain ways to do things that are difficult for students to accomplish on their own knowledge.
They usually put children in Foster Care because of various reasons such as 'neglect', 'abuse', and forcing children to do things to earn money.
No child should have to live in an environment that is not suitable for them, does not protect them, and does not provide them learning, yet they often have to live in such environments.
We see the Foster Care System as a place that is safe for these children.
Our 'Foster Care System' is supposed to provide safe places for children to stay, with people who can love and care for them, and good health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything that they did not have in the home they were taken from.
The internet can combine individual communication with communication with many people.
These ways of the internet usually provide new knowledge on how we can use the internet and gain enjoyment.
Example is, "'learning' and 'socialization'" are important motivations that make people want to use the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationship" are recognized by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new factors that motivate us to use the internet when they studied people's behavior on websites.
The practice of using video recording has enabled researchers to discover important aspects in the area of mining 'micro-expressions', the facial movements that appear within a few milliseconds.
They say that we can find out if a man or woman is lying when we correctly understand the meaning of their 'micro-expressions.'
Oliver Sacks, in the paper he wrote, The President's Speech, showed how people can't properly understand the meaning of speech because they have some damage that has happened to their brains, but they can clearly understand if a person is telling the truth.
He also said that these kinds of abilities of humans to see the meaning of behaviors in people are also possessed by animals like the dogs that we keep at home.
Research that emerged in the 'Twentieth century' showed that there are two 'pools' of 'genetic variation': one is hidden and one is visible.
Mutation causes new genetic variation to arise, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
'Segregation' and 'recombination' cause this 'variation' to occur back and forth between the two 'pools' within each 'generation'.
In the savanna, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to gain amino acids from the plants available there.
And moreover, if they are not able to do these, big things can happen: 'growth depression', 'malnutrition', and the very serious one is death.
This plant that is in this place contains 'protein' within its leaves and beans, but it is difficult for primates like us to break it down and they need to be cooked first.
Another thing, animals such as ants, termites, and eggs are easy to eat, and also they provide a high amount of protein containing all the amino acids that the body needs.
When we assess everything, we should not be surprised if the ancestors of the cultures solved their "protein issues" in the same way as chimps in the savanna do today.
'Sleep interruption' is the act of waking up during sleep and going back to sleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is what you can do when you use a 'quiet alarm clock' to wake you gently and not startle you suddenly.
If you see that you are doing a 'reset' on the clock in the middle of your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room; this will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option for 'biorhythm-based' is to drink plenty of fluids (like water or tea, a 'diuretic') before you sleep, which will force you to wake up and go urinate.
The mark of peace is within a person who has a connection, but it is the opposite of the mark of burden that resides in the body and spirit of a person.
When trouble is small, there will be more positive forces in life. All people have the strength to truly find peace of mind and happiness.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands between this main idea is our own troubles and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism follows the teachings of Buddha, but they also expand it further with the 'mahayana path of love' and also with many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Within the essence of its philosophy, Tibetan Buddhism is very calm. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, this Kundalini energy ('enlightenment energy') is known to arise within 'yoga postures', breathing exercises, 'mantras', and 'visualizations'.
The most important part of 'Tibetan meditation' is Deity Yoga. Through the 'visualization' of various deities, energy pathways are cleansed, 'chakras' are activated, and mental 'enlightenment' is achieved.
Germany was considered an enemy to many during World War 2, which led to an alliance between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, differences arose between their systems, processes, and cultures, causing the countries not to work together.
After two years following the end of the war, the groups that had worked together became like enemies and the Cold War began.
This war will last for 40 years with fighting carried out by armies representing various countries, in places of conflict from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses were broken, and the only thing to do was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were disrupted that night, as more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established a 'front' in Belarus and one in Ukraine after they entered and captured the 'eastern region' of Poland, an action which did not adhere to the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and various other international agreements made between the two countries and also among many other countries.
The practice of using ships to move things is a very good way to transport a large number of goods or people over the sea.
The work of the 'navy' is to ensure that your country is able to move cargo and people, and also to prevent enemies from moving their cargo and people.
A good example that happened not long ago is this campaign in the North Atlantic during WWII. The Americans were trying to move cargo and personnel across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the 'navy' of Germany used U-boats and tried to prevent this from happening.
If the Allies had not done what they did, Germany would probably have taken over and captured Britain as it had done in all parts of Europe.
People began domesticating goats around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began maintaining them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
The sheep that are looked after are usually placed in groups that roam around small mountains or other feeding areas. Often, the 'goatherds' watch over them and these are typically the children of the adults who are called 'shepherds'. These practices of caring for sheep are still in use today.
The wagonways were built in England in the past during the '16th Century'.
Never mind the 'wagonways', they are planks placed along the sides of the road, making it easier for horses to pull big loads on roads that are no longer rough compared to the roads that were common in those days.
They used crossties initially to keep the track in one place. Later, they realized that these tracks would be better if they had a piece of iron on top of them.
This behavior is something that many people usually do, but it causes wear on the wooden planks of the wagons.
Later, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, they made the first 'full-iron rails'.
The number one "transportation" is walking, people started walking on two legs two million years ago when Homo Erectus (this means 'upright man') appeared.
The ones that existed before, the Australopithecus, did not walk on two legs all the time.
The ability to walk on two legs is found in the fossils of Australopithecus who lived from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus walked on two legs during a period around seven million years ago.
We can start living well with the environment, we can join an 'environmental movement', and we can become 'activists' to reduce the impact of problems that may arise in the future.
Many times this is like 'symptomatic treatment'. However, if we don't want a short-term solution, then we must find the cause of the problem, and we must stop them.
He is concerned that the world is truly changing due to new advances in science and technology, and problems are getting worse because of the growing population and the lifestyle that includes possessing many large things.
After Congress adopted this document on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to a nearby printing shop owned by John Dunlop.
In the middle of the night, they made around 150 to 200 prints, now they call them "Dunlap broadsides."
The first time they read this document in public was when John Nixon read it outside Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop broadies are still there, and they are very old copies of this document. The first document, which was handwritten, is damaged.
Many of the paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think that they are the same as dinosaurs because they have 'feathers' and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they can walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today can convert information into binary number code.
A 'binary number' can have two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as 'binary digits' or 'bits' in computer language.
'Internal poisoning' does not manifest itself clearly quickly. Symptoms, such as vomiting are significant signs when people are unable to make a quick diagnosis.
The main thing that indicates 'internal poisoning' has occurred is a container of medicine or a 'toxic chemical' from the house being open and present.
Check the label on the first aid instructions of the poison.
This term 'bug' is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects.
This passage derives its meaning from bed-bugs, these insects that are known to parasitize humans.
Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are 'nidicolous', they live in the place where they were born or on something that can provide them food.
In various parts of the United States of America, there are about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the number one neurological disease among adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that the chance of women getting MS is two times more than men.
A married person can make the decision that it is not good for them, they are not good for their children, if they have a baby.
These types of couples can make the decision to place their baby for adoption.
In an 'adoption', the parents who have given birth to the child will stop their 'rights' as parents so that another couple can take care of the child.
The basic idea of science is to find out how this world works by using the scientific method. This method guides much of scientific research.
It is not yet present, 'experimentation', and an 'experiment' is a 'test' used to eliminate one or more of the ideas that have been developed, the way of asking questions, and learning also provides guidance for 'scientific research'.
The people who study 'nature' and the 'philosophers' study 'classical texts', such as the Bible in Latin.
The things that they agree on are Aristotle's ideas on science, along with psychology.
When the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West abandoned the Greek ideas on science and philosophy.
Many scientists have observed that the 'rhythms' occurring in the bodies and behaviors of animals and humans tend to follow the 'cycles' of external elements and the 'biological clock' of the body.
The 'periodic rhythms' do not only occur due to external things; this is what researchers have studied and found, and it occurs in many living organisms, including 'bacteria', 'fungi', plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are things that can maintain themselves and generate electric currents, and they can continue to run despite external factors that may cause them to stop.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the things that shows DNA is a type of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used 'phages', or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can produce a variety of things and they occur due to the type of mutation, the important function of that piece of genetic material, and whether those cells are germ-line cells.
Only the mutations that occur within germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
'Nature-based tourism' attracts people who are interested in seeing natural areas and enjoying the sights, along with the plants and animals of these areas.
Examples of 'on-site activities' are finding peace, taking photos, bird watching, and walking in parks and studying information about the ecosystem.

Every morning, all the people usually leave the small country town when they hop into cars to go to their places of work and they usually pass by other people whose workplaces are in the place they have just left and are coming to.
Inside this transport shuttle, everyone is connected together, and they support a transport system that private cars have developed.
Now science shows that this great 'carbon economy' is removing the 'biosphere' from a 'stable state' that has supported humans for two million years.
All people live within the society and use the transportation system. Nearly everyone often complains about the transportation system.
In 'developed countries' you won't hear the same kind of complaints about the quality of water or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems often create these kinds of complaints, and why do they fail to operate well every day? Do transportation engineers not know how to do their job? Or, is there something bigger going on?
'Traffic Flow' is the study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and what kind of things they usually do with one another.
However, the study of 'traffic flow' is difficult because the behavior of drivers is something that cannot be predicted one hundred percent correctly.
However, drivers tend to behave in a manner that is consistent, so that traffic tends to have some consistent characteristics that experts can demonstrate with numbers in mathematics.
To improve traffic flow, relationships must develop among three major things: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships can assist in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects are the number one animals living in the air. Their ability to fly helps them avoid their predators and find food and mates very easily.
Many insects are able to fold their wings and keep them close to their bodies, and this is a good thing.
This makes it so they have plenty of small places to hide from animals that want to eat them.
Today, the insects that do not fold their wings are the 'dragon flies' and the 'mayflies'.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people think that this is correct, but many people believe the opposite; they believe that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and other stars too).
This seems right, because we can't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river on Earth. It carries water that is 8 times more than the second largest river.
And also, the Amazon is the number one river with a very large width on Earth, and its width is six miles.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from many thousands of small rivers.
Despite the continuation of pyramid-building practices in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, they did not surpass the scale and skill of the people who constructed the pyramids of Giza.
The people of Egypt during the New Kingdom thought that these buildings of their ancestors were very different, at that time these 'pyramids' were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. This is the smallest country in the world and has a very small population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and for official communication.
The local Italian language that people know how to use within the state is also used for everyday conversation, and they use Latin to conduct religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People knew about major chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper in ancient times, because they found them in the environment in their native form and it was easy to find them with the tools of the past.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the idea that everything is made up of combinations of one or more of the four elements. These elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is the same as the four 'states of matter' (and follows the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and 'plasma', it also says that they change and produce new things to make the things that we see.
Alloys are things that contain two or more metals inside them. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like 'calcium' and 'potassium' are considered as metals. There are other metals too like silver and gold.
You can have alloys that contain small amounts of elements that are not metals, like carbon, inside them.
Everything inside the Universe is made from 'matter'. All 'matter' has small things inside them which are called 'atoms'.
Atoms are extremely tiny, and a trillion of them can fit within one full stop at the end of a sentence.
Therefore, the pencil has been a good friend to many people ever since it appeared.
However, when new methods of writing emerged, the pencil took a lower position, and not many people used it.
Nowadays, people write information on computer screens, and they don't come close to a sharpener.
We can think about what will happen to the keyboards when something new comes up.
'Fission bomb' operates by following a process that obtains energy and creates a 'nucleus' with many 'protons' and 'neutrons'.
It is similar to pushing a heavy object up a small mountain. The process of 'splitting nucleus' also releases some of this energy.
Some 'atoms' have 'unstable nuclei' and this means that they can break even with a small touch or without being touched.
The surface of the Moon has rocks and dust. The 'outer layer' of the Moon is called the 'crust'.
Its "crust" is about 70 km thick on the side that is nearby and 100 km thick on the side that is farther away.
It is thinner under 'maria' and thicker under 'highlands'.
It looks like there will be more 'maria' formations on the nearby side because the 'crust' is thinner. It is easier for 'lava' to come up to the outside.
'Content theories' often seek to discover what things can motivate people or influence their feelings and thoughts.
These theories say that people have certain needs and desires that develop within them as they grow up.
These theories focus on what internal factors within individuals drive them to like the things they do and what external factors in the environment will influence them to do something or not do something.
Two 'content theories' that many people are familiar with are the Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
If we consider everything, two behaviors become evident when managers start to cross the lines of their group. On one hand, they want to stay as "one of the team members" (or a woman in the group).
This kind of manager knows how to deal with making decisions that people do not like, giving warnings to those who break the law, checking the performance of workers, assigning tasks to workers, and directly telling workers when they are making mistakes.
On the other hand, a manager changes and becomes like someone the team doesn’t know well, feeling as though they must change everything the team is doing and make everyone do everything independently.
After everything, it is the leader's job to ensure the team performs well or does not perform well.
This behavior often causes problems to arise among the leaders and the teams.
All the teams that work with computers can have the same standards for good work just like the teams that work in the office, but there are some small differences.
All the teams that work with the computer usually function like a person who joins groups that work together in the office.
They can do things at their own convenience more during times when they usually work in the office, like when they meet with other team members at convenient times across different time zones, and this is something that local managers may not clearly understand.
One true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique element that exists within teams that work together with computers.
This "invisible team" is a 'management team' to which each member of the team reports. This 'invisible team' sets the standard for each member to follow.
Why would an organization want to engage in work that typically takes a lot of time? This is the work of developing an organization that is good at learning things. One of the main ideas of implementing 'organizational learning' within an organization is the practice of 'innovation'.
When the departments of an organization use all resources well, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Because of this, the process of an organization working together and overcoming a difficult issue can lead to new and different processes to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can have new and different ways of doing things, the leaders must create a culture of developing new and different things, and also, there must be a practice of sharing knowledge and learning together.
Angel (2006) clearly discusses the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. As a result, it makes the area of research become more focused and makes it more precise.
The relationship between 'brain pathology' and behavior supports scientists in their research.
They have known for a long time that various damages occur in the brain, such as trauma, lesions, and tumors, which can change behavior and bring about changes in thinking.
These new technologies that have emerged help us to see and conduct investigations on the structures and processes of the brain that we have not seen before.
This is able to provide us with new information and material to develop 'simulation models' that can help us to better understand the processes that occur within our thinking.
Although AI makes people think of 'science fiction', AI has developed into an important field within 'computer science', where it is able to perform tasks related to reasoning, learning, and adapting within a machine.
Research inside AI is the work of making machines perform tasks that occur regularly and require the knowledge of a particular job to make decisions.
Example, it controls things, plans and schedules timing of things, is knowledgeable in answering customers' questions, and recognizes handwriting, voice, and face.
These types of things have individual areas of study by themselves and look at ways to provide answers to problems that arise every day.
Now they are using this AI system within the areas of 'economics', 'medicine', 'engineering' and 'military', and they have used it to build some home computers and 'video game software applications'.
Field trips are an important part of classrooms. Many times, teachers want to take their students to places they can't just reach by bus.
Technology provides an opportunity with a 'field trip' that happens on the computer. Students can look at 'museum artifacts', see an 'aquarium', and view a nice 'art' while they sit inside the class.
The act of sharing a 'field trip' on the computer is a good way to remember a journey and share experiences with the class afterward.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, and each year, the website gets a new style, but the old versions remain online like a scrapbook.
Blogs can help students improve their writing. Often, students start their blogs with grammar and spelling that aren't very good, and when others read them, they will change and write better.
Because the students often talk a lot if something is not right, this student who writes a blog will start writing well to avoid comments saying that they do not write well.
And also, 'blogging' "drives students to learn more about things happening in the community where they are." This need to meet the needs of their blog readers causes the students to gain more knowledge and become 'interesting' (Toto, 2004).
'Blogging' is a tool that helps people to work together, and it strengthens something by spreading what they learn beyond what they usually learn in a day at school.
Use blogs in a good and correct way that can enable students to evaluate things and understand what is incorrect and what is proper; when working with materials on the Internet, students can become aware of the standard they are at when evaluating what others have written and also can share their own thoughts on emerging issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada where people use two languages and it has art galleries and museums that show the past and the present time in Canada.
To the west is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka, a place that looks nice and has other places around it.
People outside say that all these things and some more show that Ontario is a place that truly represents the colors of Canada.
Large areas in the far north have few people, and some places are uninhabited.
One thing to consider among the population that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the US than the total number of citizens in Canada.
Eastern African Islanders are those who live in the Indian Ocean outside the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is truly very large, and it is somewhat like a continent of its own when we look at it from the perspective of wildlife.
Many of the small islands are independent countries, or they can be part of France, and they can be 'luxury beach resorts'.
And also, the Arabs brought Islam to these areas, and it became a major religion in Comoros and Mayotte.
The attitude and thinking of the people in Europe and 'colonialism' started in the '15th century', when explorer Vasco de Gama from Portugal discovered the Cape Route while he was in Europe and went to India.
In the northern part of the region, the Sahel surrounds it, and in the west the Atlantic Ocean surrounds it.
The women: It is good that the women who go there must say they are married, even if they are not truly married.
It is good to wear one ring (do not wear a ring that looks expensive).
Women must be aware that the customs of other cultures can cause what they consider harassment to occur, and often people may follow you, hold your hand, and similar actions.
You must be strong and say no to people, don't be afraid to stand firm and speak up (because this behavior is typical of this place, it's not okay for them to do that!).
The city of Casablanca today was established by the Berber people who were known to catch fish in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenid as an important port which they called Anfa.
The Portuguese damaged it and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they abandoned this place after an earthquake occurred in 1755.
The 'sultans' of Morocco rebuilt this city as Daru l-Badya, and the traders of Spain referred to it as Casablanca when they established their centers there.
Inside all parts of Casablanca, it is one of the places where there is no good place to buy things.
In old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell Moroccan items, such as 'tagine', 'pottery', 'leather goods', 'hookahs', and various 'geegaws', but all these things are for tourists to buy.
Goma is a city that tourists often want to visit in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the east near the country of Rwanda.
In the year 2002, the hot fire of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and covered much of the roads of this town, this happened significantly right in the middle of the town.
Even though Goma is relatively safe, tourists visiting places outside Goma must find out and be well informed about the kind of fighting occurring in North Kivu province.
This city is the place to stay and climb the Nyiragongo volcano with the people who search for the Mountain Gorilla. The price of these gorilla-tracking groups is more reasonable than others in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to travel around in Goma. The local price for this is approximately 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Another thing is that "Timbuktu" is also difficult to reach, and they use this name as a figure of speech for things that are different and located in distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a town that doesn’t have much, even though it has a good reputation that attracts tourists, and it has an airport.

It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so you must exchange money before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and then it changes again.
Montevideo is located within the 'subtropics'; during the summer months, its temperature often stays above +30°C.

There is no "rainy season" and "dry season": the level of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals inside the park are used to seeing people, they are wild animals, and people should not feed them or disturb them.
The park authorities say that people must stay 100 yards/meters or more away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
Although they seem calm, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can fight.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.

The 'stirrups' are the supports for the legs of the 'rider' that hang down on either side of the 'saddle'.
They usually provide more stability for the rider, but they can cause safety issues because the rider's leg might get caught inside them.
If a rider falls from a horse, but their leg is caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them as it runs away. To reduce the likelihood of this happening, riders must take precautions to avoid it.
Number one, many riders usually wear riding boots that have a heel and a smooth, long sole.
Another thing, some saddles, these are English saddles, they have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall down from the saddle if a rider falls backwards.

If the country you are going to has issued advisories about things you must be cautious of, some changes might occur in your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
And also, you can receive information coming from the government that is not your own, but the information from them is for their citizens.
For example, the American citizens in the Middle East will be in a different group from those in Europe and the Arabs.

People who want to change their gender should not think that they will go under a scanner and their privacy will remain hidden.
'Rip currents' are ocean tides that break onto the beach and move back, often in a rip or something similar.
Because of 'underwater typology' the water that returns meets at places that are deep, and a 'fast current' that goes to the deep area can form there.
Many deaths occur because people feel compelled to try to swim back against the current, and this is difficult to do.
When you get outside the current, the act of swimming back will not be difficult to do.
Try to swim to a place where the current won't pull you back again, follow your marker as you swim, and if there are people watching you, you can consider waiting for them to save you.

Each part of the story is shown on top of the 'pyramid' and they can bring light to the different kinds of 'pyramid'.
South Shetland Islands, they were discovered in 1819, and more than one country has claimed them, and they have many centers, sixteen of which were still active in the year 2020.
This group of islands is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where people live in Villa Las Estrellas.
Other places are Livingston Island and Deception, where the 'flooded caldera' of the volcano, which is still active, provides a certain kind of view of this base.
Ellsworth Land is a region located in the south of the Peninsula, and the Bellingshausen Sea surrounds it.
The mountains of the Peninsula here join with the lands on the top, and then it is clear again and forms a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains where the Minnesota Glacier divides it into two parts.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains some of Antarctica's tallest mountains, including Vinson Massif and Mount Vinson, which has a height of 4,892 m.

Many times there will be a school fee to enroll in these education programs.
Finland is a good country for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has many thousands of islands within the lakes and the sea.
On the small islands and the lagoons, you will not need a yacht.
Small islands in the sea and the number one big lake can be reached by a 'yacht' or small boat or 'kayak' which can provide another way to enjoy.
"Boating" or the practice of going around in a boat is something that all people in Finland like to do. They have many boats, one boat can fit 7 or 8 people.
This is the same as in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but a little different (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is 40).
Many of the Baltic Cruises allow people to stay for a long time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can see the city with its history during the day time and then come back at night and sleep on the ship.
If you go ashore on the side of the water with 'shipboard excursion' you will not need to have another visa (this started in 2009).
Some of the cruises claim in their brochures that they take people to Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the ocean and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
The experience of flying in an airplane can be one that gives people various feelings and comes from different places of fear, especially if they have not flown before or have been involved in a previous bad incident on an airplane.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not like other things that people are usually afraid of and other things that many people are often tired of.
For some people, the ability to clearly understand how an airplane operates and what happens when it is in motion can help them reduce fears that arise from things they are not familiar with or situations where they feel they lack control.
Courier companies often handle goods promptly. Many times, it is important to do this with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts to make a quick repair.
On one route, big companies have their own planes, but on another route and in small businesses there has been a problem.
If they send something by cargo plane, on some routes it will take many days to get through unloading and customs.

The best way to travel by plane in first class or business class is to use a lot of money to get this nice service (or, even better, let your company spend this money on you).
However, this doesn't come at a small price: often, you may pay a price that is four times higher than the price of an economy class ticket to get a business class ticket, and you may pay a price that's eleven times higher to get a first-class ticket.
There is no basis for requesting a discount price on business class or first class on 'direct flights', from one place to another.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money to travel quickly to a destination and receive good service on the plane, and that is why they charge this kind of price.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language of this place is Romanian, but they often use Russian in many areas.
Moldova is a republic that has various ethnic groups which have experienced difficult times due to conflicts and fighting that happened between ethnic groups.
