This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also conveys detailed aspects such as color and three-dimensional arrangement, which are generally not found in fossils.
According to scientists, this animal's feathers were chestnut on the outside and warm-colored on the inside.
This discovery also provided clues for exploring the evolution of bird feathers.
Although the feathers of dinosaurs did not have a fully developed shaft known as a rachis, they did have characteristics typical of other feathers such as downy barbs and filaments. Researchers, therefore, speculate that the evolution of the rachis likely occurred after these other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it is speculated that they were used not for the purpose of flight, but for temperature regulation or visual effects. Researchers suggested that despite this being a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows adult feathers, indicating that they are not chick feathers.
Researchers suggest that despite this specimen being the tail of a young dinosaur, it has adult feathers rather than chick feathers.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb explosion at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, resulted in the death of two police officers and injured more than 20 people.
According to the governor's office reports, 19 of the injured were police officers.
The police stated that they suspect extremist Daesh (ISIL) of being involved in the attack.
They discovered that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars. It was found that the activity of all stars within a star system is driven solely by their luminosity and rotation, with no other influencing factors.
The combination of luminosity and rotation determines the Rossby number of a star related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the lower the activity of stars in relation to magnetic reversal.

The frustration within this community has led to the current efforts to draft a policy on sexual content for a site that hosts millions of pieces of open-licensed media.
The content was mostly theoretical, but the program written was intended to simulate the observations conducted in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect this team was looking for was likely the action due to the tidal force working between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way also exerts influence on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies is said to surround the galaxy like a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

Mr. Huhne will resign, and in the cabinet, Member of Parliament Ed Davey is expected to be his successor. With Davey's departure, it is anticipated that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will take the vacant position of Secretary of State for Business.
Mr. Foone and Mr. Price are scheduled to appear at the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The deceased were Nicholas Alden (25 years old) and Zachary Cuddeback (21 years old), who served as the driver.
Mr. Edgar Begira suffered injuries to his arms and jaw, and Mr. Christopher Schneider sustained severe injuries that require reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka aimed the weapon at the fifth man's head and failed. Schneider is in pain, has lost sight in one eye, part of his skull is missing, and his face has been reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a U.S. Air Force base in his homeland.
After the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two individual races in the championship.
The first race was a slalom, but she did not finish (Did Not Finish) on her first run. In this race, 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result.
In another race, the giant slalom, she finished with an overall time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, placing 10th in the women's sitting group. This time was 2 minutes 11.60 seconds slower than Austria's Claudia Loesch, who took 1st place, and 1 minute 09.02 seconds slower than Hungary's Gyöngyi Dani, who finished 9th.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers could not finish their run, and in the giant slalom, 45 out of 117 participants did not rank.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General of Police D.K. Arya stated, "We have arrested the five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjhar, Bhuta Kanjhar, Rambro Kanjhar, Gaza Kanjhar, and Vishnu Kanjhar.
According to Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendant appeared in court with their face covered.
At the time of the car collision, there were three people inside the house, but there were no injuries.
However, the driver sustained a severe head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed until the emergency team rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Mr. Adekoya subsequently appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his son.
She is being detained until her indictment and trial, but because her photo has been widely circulated, there is a possibility that witness evidence could be compromised.
This is something commonly done in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's judiciary system is different, and the court regards the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists who publish photos of suspects are walking a fine line."
The Criminal Division of the Court of the Thorne, which is fully in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to the press that it will not make any further comments at least until charges are filed.
According to the information I overheard, the document in question refers to a border dispute, and Palestine's hope is based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
It is reported that issues such as the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the Jordan Valley are also being addressed.
Israel demands a continuation of deployment in the canyon for ten years if this agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to a deployment period of only five years.
The auxiliary pest control trial is monitored and its effectiveness assessed, so the shooters participating in this trial were under strict supervision by the rangers.
Qualified volunteers were recruited for the hunting program of the Sports Shooting Association through the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooting Association (NSW).
According to Mick Offlin, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, who collaborates with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in with the new provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which is composed of nine members.
For Martelly, it's the fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of the previous European Commission as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This committee was a measure taken by President Martelly in response to the widespread anti-establishment protests that began in October.
At times becoming violent, these protests were triggered by the failure to hold scheduled elections and have occurred since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 people sustaining minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple reported an additional 34 overheating incidents described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by saying it was "truly regrettable" regarding Apple's reporting delay.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office (EMO) of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported nationwide.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer has hijacked a bus and is holding tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, but so far at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, and Filipino photographers were also released.
The photographers acted as a stand-in for an elderly woman who wanted to go to the restroom. Suspect Mendoza was shot dead.
Riggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He underwent training as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his spare time to begin research on premature birth.
His research found that administering hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was also my first manager. Luna passed away on a night when there were two moons. It was quite a unique night, just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was just as bizarre as I was... or maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... If possible, I want her to be in heaven."
In a public opinion poll conducted with 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing the republication of Australia increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should transition to a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
According to the public opinion survey, 34% of people agree with this opinion and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the public opinion poll, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should not, resulting in polarized outcomes.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but health concerns have been raised due to symptoms they reported.
He couldn't take the medication necessary to control the pain because it was banned at the competition.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
This discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software by early February and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, carrying organic compounds that form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand how planets, particularly Earth, were formed since a comet collided with Earth long ago.
53-year-old Mr. Cuomo, who took office as governor earlier this year, signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political gossip and folly."
It is speculated that they might run for president in 2016.
FAA claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly short-haul routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
We have adopted a satellite-based technology that contrasts with traditional ground radar technology, allowing controllers to more accurately identify aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.
Special transportation arrangements are not in place, overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking or park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Due to concerns about the lack of transportation options, there is a possibility that the team supporters may not gather, forcing the match to be held in a closed venue.
A study published in the academic journal "Science" on Thursday reported that a new species of bird had emerged in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that this new species evolved in just two generations, but this process was thought to take much longer because it is the product of breeding between the native Galapagos finch and the introduced large cactus finch.
Gold is a metal that can be shaped into various forms. It is also possible to roll it up and make it smaller.
It can be pulled into a wire shape and then twisted or braided. If hammered or rolled out, it can also be made into a sheet shape.
It can be stretched very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is used for decorating the hand-drawn illustrations called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is referred to as the pH of a chemical substance. You can make test paper using the juice from purple cabbage.
Cabbage juice reacts with chemicals and changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) contained in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton from which an electron has been removed (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and knead them in a circular motion, then squeeze them tightly with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, creating a strange sensation and forming something like a shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, the sewage system was well-developed, and almost all homes had flush toilets.
Remains of sewer systems have been discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. During the Roman civilization era, there were also examples where they were installed as part of communal bathhouse facilities for mixed bathing.
When you make a call to someone who is thousands of miles away, it automatically becomes a satellite-mediated call.
The artificial satellites in space receive calls and reflect them almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The reason scientists use telescopes in space is that part of the light and scenery entering human vision is distorted by the Earth's atmosphere.
To launch satellites and telescopes and deploy them into space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is first needed.
This wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. Its greatest achievement for us is that it has made transportation much more comfortable and faster.
Trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation originated from there.
Below that, there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to serows and deer.
Lastly, there are a great number of smaller cats (including stray cats) that prey on far more numerous smaller animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of that success lies in the concept of a niche, where each cat has a special job and ensures that it does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of 1 to 3 related males and more than 30 females and their offspring.
Typically, the females are related by blood and form large family groups consisting of sisters and daughters.
A lion's pride exhibits behavior similar to that of wolf or dog packs, and these animals surprisingly resemble lions (and other big cats) in their behavior, capturing prey without letting it escape.
With a remarkably well-proportioned body and high athletic ability, a tiger can climb, swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human, although it is not particularly skilled at these activities.
The tiger belongs to the same group of animals (Panthera genus) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. Only these four types of large cats have the ability to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not a majestic roar like that of a lion, but rather an intimidating threat.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. If possible, they also capture monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the prey hunted by ocelots are creatures much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots sniff the ground to find the places where prey have passed by and then chase after them.
With excellent night vision, it is adept at seeing in the dark and skilled at moving stealthily. The ocelot blends into its surroundings, pouncing on prey to hunt.
When a small group of living creatures (with a small number of individuals) separates from the large group they belonged to (for example, by moving across mountain ranges or rivers, or to a new island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment from before.
In this new environment, because different resources and different competitors exist, the new group may require characteristics and adaptations different from what was previously necessary, potentially becoming formidable competitors.
The original group has not changed at all and still requires adaptation just as it did in the past.
As a new group begins to adapt to a new environment, over time, it starts to exhibit different characteristics from other groups.
Eventually, thousands to millions of years later, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses with plants and make clothes from them. Many of the ingredients we eat daily are plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Since the Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, it had no creatures to fear other than other Mosasauruses.
Its long jaw is lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and there is another row of teeth on the palate, meaning that once you pass through here, there is no escape.
It is uncertain, but it might have had a bifurcated (forked) tongue. It may have eaten turtles and large fish and possibly engaged in cannibalism by eating other mosasaurs.
Also, it will attack anything that enters the water and even huge dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus would stand no chance.
Most of their food is familiar to us, but the Romans consumed exotic and rare dishes such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that poor people and women preferred to sit in chairs to eat, whereas wealthy men favored banquets where they could recline and relax while eating.
It is impossible for ingredients that migrated to Europe from America and Asia in later centuries to have been incorporated into ancient Roman meals.
For example, there were neither corn, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa there, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built the primary temples for each of the gods, and these were considered to be the houses of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' wishes through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner shrine that only priests were allowed to enter.
As part of the temple, a special pyramid-shaped tower called a ziggurat was sometimes built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
For people living in the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
Hebrew families mostly lived outdoors.
The women cooked in the garden, and the shops were merely stalls facing the street. Stone was used in the construction of houses.
Because there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, timber was very expensive and valuable.
Greenland was a sparsely populated region. According to Nordic tradition, Erik the Red discovered Greenland and named it when he was exiled from Iceland for murder and headed west.
However, regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
While all countries are part of "Scandinavia," there were significant differences in the national characteristics, monarchies, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
Those who have seen the movie "National Treasure" might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence.
However, it was not the case. There is something written on the back, but it was not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, what was written was the title "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The title is inscribed upside down at the bottom of the document.
It is unclear who wrote it, but this large parchment (measuring 29.75 inches x 24.5 inches) was known to have been stored in a rolled state during its early practical use.
Therefore, it tends to be simply added as a label.
Northern France was liberated by the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles, but the south was not yet liberated.
The rulers were the French of "Vichy." They are the French who made peace with the German army in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
Civilization is a society, in other words, a culture shared by a large group of people living or working together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin adjective "civilis," meaning "citizen," and is related to the Latin noun "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," which in some way defines the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilization and culture mean the inheritance of knowledge over several generations, the survival of cultural footprints, and fair dissemination.
Cultures that deviate from the mainstream often disappear without being recognized as official civilizations, and as a result, no historical evidence remains.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, and the Continental Congress was its only component.
The Congress had no power to tax and lacked national executive and judicial branches, so all actions of Congress relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative.
There was also no authority to nullify interstate tax laws or tariffs.
Amendments to the articles required unanimous consent from all states, but since each state often disregarded the central government, their representatives were frequently absent.
The Italian national soccer team is tied with the German national team as the second best-performing team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, F1 motor racing, and more.
In the northern region, winter sports are popular, and it produces Italian athletes who participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands, with the largest being the Honshu Island, which is considered the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is a collection of islands, so it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors named the island "Ilha Formosa" (beautiful island).
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, transformed the indigenous grain production methods, and employed Chinese workers to engage in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) military occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, it declared Taiwan a province of the Qing state.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki and ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana (sundial), the Temple of the Sun (Great Tower), and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can better understand their traditional appearance.
By 1976, Machu Picchu had been restored up to 30%, and it continues to be restored to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the mainstream film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the format of digital camera image sensors.
It's confusing, but the 35 mm format actually measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio in this format (finding the simplest whole number ratio by dividing by 12) is said to be 3:2.
Many common recording formats (e.g., APS system recording formats) have this aspect ratio or something close to it.
The "rule of thirds" may be disregarded by some people, but it is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in imagery.
The most effective position to place the main subject is considered to be within the area surrounded by the intersections of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this era, the Catholic Church, which had become economically prosperous and a powerful force in European history, came under scrutiny.
Christianity has linked European countries with different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
Its universal power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
The central church authority has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and with the concentration of power and resources, many people have begun to question whether its doctrines are being fulfilled.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy was effective and disrupted the supply of important military and civilian goods, but this blockade violated international law, which had been codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries and was generally recognized.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, bringing danger even to neutral vessels.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany assumed a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the ideologies that had spread to most citizens and the nation were pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, various countries hoped to avoid falling into such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison in New York.
I went to America with almost no money, carrying a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (my former boss).
In ancient China, there was a unique way of indicating differences between eras, and each stage in Chinese history or the ruling family in power became a distinctive dynasty.
Additionally, between each dynasty, there were unstable periods in the fragmented regions. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties and lasted for 60 years.
In such times, many nobles were engaged in fierce battles over the throne.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands fought amidst the struggle for the highest position in the grand palace of Xi'an.
The adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, patriotism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than a sole ruler, all had significant social and political impacts.
After the revolution, jobs became open to public application, and all men were eligible to apply. The most motivated and successful candidates were able to secure positions.
The same can be said for the military. This is because the rankings are now based on ability rather than military ranks.
The French Revolution inspired many members of the working class who were oppressed in other countries, leading to the start of revolutions in each nation.
Muhammad had a deep interest in issues beyond everyday life. He often visited the cave called "Hira" in the mountain of "Nur" (Light) for meditation.
The cave that has endured through the ages vividly reflects the spiritual devotion of Muhammad.
The cave is located at the summit north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In reality, even if you know the existence of the cave, it's not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, it is a completely isolated space.
All I can see are the clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, barely anything of the outside world is visible, and the sounds from outside are barely heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, constructed by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many large pyramid structures built to enshrine deceased pharaohs.
On the Giza Plateau, which extends across Egypt's Valley of the Dead (the cemetery site of Giza), there are several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid of Giza), many smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is a gigantic tomb built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples surrounding it are dedicated to Khufu's wives and family.
The up-bow mark looks like a V shape, while the down-bow mark resembles a staple or the bottom side of a square with a missing edge.
An "up bow" is when you start from the tip and push the bow, and a "down bow" begins from the frog (the part held by the hand) and involves pulling the bow.
Up-bows usually produce a soft sound, while down-bows create a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can freely write symbols in pencil, but remember that there are musical reasons for the printed arc-shaped symbols. Usually, you should follow those symbols.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, who was terrified, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and King's sister Princess Élisabeth were forcibly taken from the Palace of Versailles to Paris by the mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob shouting and hurling threats at the king and queen.
The crowd, having turned into a mob, forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
One time, in front of the terrified queen, one of the rioters displayed the head of a royal guard who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The cost incurred in the conquest of the Philippines due to American imperialism was borne by the Filipinos.
They were left with no choice but to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the majority of their expenses, and they also had to pay the interest on bonds that were being sold under the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the excess profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos constituted the fundamental interests of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it is necessary to understand the context in which their order was born.
The era in which this event occurred is called the High Middle Ages, generally corresponding to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 AD to 1300 AD) in European history.
The High Middle Ages are considered as the period between the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages in historical periodization, and it is customary to consider that the Late Middle Ages ended by the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological advancement and technical norms to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assertions. One is that the development of technology itself follows a path that significantly surpasses cultural and political influences, and the other is that technology is not socially conditioned but rather has an "impact" on the inherent society.
For example, it might be said that automobiles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, since a mere handful of cars does not justify the profitability of a nationwide road network, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increase in car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn results in the development of new technologies in the medical field for treating injured bodies.
Romanticism inherently contained a major element of cultural determinism, shaped by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, harmonizing with the social arena and proving superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the modern world, Constantinople thrived as the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxurious attire began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status declined mainly because crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valued than those from the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of the center of fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak periods of the Gothic style were from the 10th to the 11th century and the 14th century.
The original attire was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the Western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the largest advancements of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was the beginning of using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of farming where only the amount of food necessary for the agricultural workers and their families is produced.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that aims to maximize yields using reserved seeds native to the ecosystem region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, and is often organic farming.
Historically, the majority of farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this trend is still observed in many developing countries.
Subculture is a culture where like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards come together to nurture their authenticity.
The characteristics of a subculture can be determined by factors such as the age, ethnicity, class, location, and gender of its members.
The characteristics that define subculture may be language, beauty, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these elements.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through a distinct symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children whose adaptation to society is hindered by adults during their growth process due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Children like these are called "wild children" or "feral kids." Wild children may be kept in confinement by people (usually their own parents), and one cause of such neglect is when parents refuse to raise children with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
There are also those who are said to have been raised by animals, as well as those who are believed to have lived on their own in the wild.
Feral children raised and grown by non-human animals often exhibit behavior almost identical to that of those animals, such as fearing humans or being indifferent to them, within physical limitations.
In project-based learning, learning should become easier and more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a means to support individuals who are using new computer programs, starting new projects, or having new learning experiences.
There is both virtual and real scaffolding. In other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, and so is the Microsoft Office paperclip figure.
The virtual scaffold is incorporated into this software with the aim of allowing students to ask questions, receive instructions, and understand explanations about procedures that they might find difficult to handle on their own.
The reasons why children are placed in foster care vary widely, from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
Every child should grow up in a nurturing, caring, and well-educated environment, but feral children grow up in environments lacking these conditions.
We recognize that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
The foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving upbringing, solid education, and reliable medical care.
In the foster parent system, all essential items that were lacking in the previous home are provided before taking in the child.
The internet is an environment that combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
A significant feature of the Internet derives further dimensions from the perspective of approaches to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationship" were identified as new motivational aspects when Eighmey & McCord (1998) investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro-expressions that last for only a few milliseconds, in other words, facial movements.
It is claimed that, in particular, by accurately interpreting microexpressions, one can detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks notes in his essay "The President's Speech" that even people who are unable to understand speech due to brain disorders can correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior might also be common among animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has revealed that there are two gene pools in genetic variation: hidden and expressed ones.
A new genetic mutation is introduced by mutation, and it is removed from the pool of expressed variations through selection.
Niche differentiation and recombination shuffle variations between two pools across generations.
For primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to obtain essential amino acids from the plant resources available in the savanna environment.
Moreover, neglecting this can lead to serious situations such as growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these nutrients are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Meanwhile, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and serve as a high-quality source of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering all factors, it is not surprising that our ancestors might have solved the "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees living in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during regular sleeping hours and then falling back asleep after a short while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring back consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm unconsciously, there's a method where you can place the clock on the opposite side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other measures based on the biorhythm include drinking more fluids (especially water or diuretic teas) before sleep, creating a situation where you are forced to wake up to urinate.
The degree to which a person shows peace of mind is in direct contrast to the degree of physical or mental tension.
The lower the level of tension, the more positive vitality is generated. Everyone has the potential ability to discover absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only things that hinder this goal are one's own anxieties and negative feelings.
Tibetan Buddhism is a faith based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by integrating many techniques from Mahayana Buddhism's compassion and Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness toward all.
Kundalini Yoga is an approach that combines yoga poses, breathing, mantra, and mudra to awaken the Kundalini (the soul of the self).
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness arises.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the two countries came into conflict due to clashes in systems, processes, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allied nations became enemy countries, and eventually the Cold War began.
After that, it continued for 40 years, with real battles taking place in conflict zones such as Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, and Cuba, through proxy armies.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had already been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became a thing of the past almost overnight. After more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded the eastern region of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties (both bilateral and multilateral), they formed the Belarusian Front and the Ukrainian Front.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to move people and goods in large quantities across the sea.
Traditionally, the navy's job has been to maintain the capability to transport its own citizens and supplies while ensuring the disruption of the enemy's capability to do the same.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic operations during World War II. The United States attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to assist the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German Navy was mainly using U-boats to try to block this transportation.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the other European countries.
The domestication of goats is believed to have started around 10,000 years ago, with the central area being the western Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate goats, which provided easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Generally, domesticated goats were allowed to roam freely in hilly areas and other pastures, and the caretakers of the goat herds were usually boys. This practice continues to this day.
In England, wagonways were already established by the 16th century.
The cart path was merely lined with wooden planks laid parallel, but with horses pulling them, it was possible to transport larger loads at high speed, compared to the somewhat rough roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced at a fairly early stage to fix the tracks in place. Eventually, it became gradually apparent that it was efficient to provide iron tips on the top of them.
This became common, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the carriages to wear out.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, all-iron rails were introduced for the first time.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking, and human bipedalism began with the appearance of Homo erectus ("upright man") two million years ago.
The direct ancestor, Australopithecus, did not have the habit of continuing bipedal walking for more than a certain period of time.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, but the characteristics of bipedalism have been confirmed in the fossils of Australopithecus from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago.
You can start living a more environmentally friendly life, you can participate in environmental movements, or you can become an activist to alleviate future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic therapy. However, rather than just seeking a temporary solution, it is necessary to identify the root cause of the problem and deactivate it.
The world has changed significantly due to the advancement of human science and technology, and it is a well-established fact that problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted in Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies were made overnight, and they are now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of this document was conducted by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One letter was sent to George Washington on July 6 and was read to the troops in New York on July 9. Another one arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 known existing copies of the Dunlap Broadside are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten version does not exist.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider it a dinosaur because it has wings and can fly.
However, even now, the appearance of birds resembles that of dinosaurs in many ways.
It has feet with scales and claws, is ovoviviparous, and walks on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary form.
The binary system is represented by either of the two values (0 or 1), and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers or bits when used in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not become apparent immediately. Since symptoms like vomiting are common, a diagnosis cannot be made instantly.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is that the container of drugs or toxic household chemicals is open.
Check the poison label to see if there are any first aid instructions specific to that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "insect" in its formal sense for this group of insects.
The name originates from the fact that bed bugs, with their high adaptability, have been parasitic pests infesting beds since ancient times.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States, the known number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) is said to be about 400,000, and it is known as a representative neurological disorder in young and middle-aged individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
According to research, it is known that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
Some couples may determine that parenting is not beneficial for either the parent or the child.
Such couples can use the adoption system for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents lose parental rights, and another couple can become the parents of the child.
The primary goal of science is to elucidate the workings of the world through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guideline for most scientific research.
However, that's not all. An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions or making observations also serves as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were focusing on classical texts, particularly the Bible written in Latin.
The views of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, Western countries realized that they were becoming detached from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior critically depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and the mechanisms engraved through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms are recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and are not merely responses to periodic signals from the external environment.
The internal clock is an autonomous oscillator that continues to circulate freely for a certain period, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the significant experiments suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages (viruses) to transplant their DNA into bacteria.
They attempted two experiments: one was marking the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other was marking the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can produce a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ cells are inherited by offspring, while mutations that occur in other parts of the body may lead to cell death or cause cancer.
Tourism that emphasizes interaction with nature attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park tours, and gathering information about ecosystems.
An example would be traveling to Borneo Island to meet orangutans, take photographs, and learn about them.
Every morning, people departing from a small rural town to work pass by those who have workplaces near their own starting point.
In this dynamic reciprocal transportation, everyone is connected in some way to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this large-scale carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Anyone who participates in social life uses transportation systems. Almost all of them are dissatisfied with the traffic system.
In developed countries, complaints about things like water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints and break down routinely? Are the transportation system engineers simply incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow research is the study of the movements and interactions of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range, and therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have a certain degree of reasonable consistency, which can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to more accurately represent traffic flow, relationships among the three main characteristics of (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed have been established.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. The ability to fly helped them avoid predators and efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects are able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This widens the range of narrow spaces where they can hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a scholar named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people acknowledged his theory as correct, but many believed the opposite, thinking that in the solar system, the sun (and other stars) moved around the earth.
Since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, this seems to make sense, doesn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. Its water volume exceeds that of the second largest river by eight times.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some places reaching a width of 6 miles.
20% of the water that flows from rivers to the ocean on Earth comes from the Amazon River.
The main stream of the Amazon River extends for 6,387 km (3,980 miles). This river collects water flow from thousands of small rivers.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the pyramids of Giza surpassed others in their size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at monuments that had been built more than a thousand years earlier.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
In Vatican City, Italian is used for laws and official communications.
In Vatican City, the language most people use daily is Italian, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
It is known that basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been highly valued by people since ancient times, and all of these can be discovered in their natural forms in nature and can be relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that all things are composed of mixtures of one or more of four elements. These four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is something close to the four states of matter—solid, liquid, gas, plasma (in this order)—but his theory also explained that they transform into new substances and form what we see in this world.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more types of metals. Remember the many elements listed on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Additionally, those that contain trace amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon are also classified as alloys.
Everything that exists in the universe is made of matter. Every substance is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are unimaginably small, so it is possible for trillions of atoms to fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, pencils, when they first emerged into the world, were good friends to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and use of pencils have declined.
Nowadays, more people are entering messages on computer screens, and pencil sharpeners are no longer needed.
I can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something even newer emerges.
A nuclear bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to bring together many protons and neutrons into a single atomic nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. When the atomic nucleus is split again, part of its energy is released.
Within atoms, there are those that have unstable nuclei, and these nuclei tend to undergo fission with little to no external influence.
The lunar surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
Beneath the ocean is thin, and under the highlands is thick.
Because the Earth's crust is thin, there are often more seas on the closer side. Lava had become more likely to rise to the surface.
Content theory is centered on finding what tickles or appeals to people's minds.
These theories suggest that people have certain internalized needs and desires that emerge as they reach adulthood and mature.
These theories consider the motivations behind why certain types of people are inclined to do certain things on a daily basis and the environmental factors that either permit or prevent them from doing so.
The two content theories commonly regarded are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager is tasked with leading former colleagues, two kinds of behaviors may emerge. One behavior is the attempt to remain "one of the team."
Administrators of this type are not good at making unpopular decisions, disciplining employees, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and confirming accountability.
At the other extreme is the transformation into an unrecognizable individual who feels that the team must change everything they have been doing with their own hands.
In the end, the leader will ultimately be responsible for the team's success or failure.
This action often causes a rift between the leader and the remaining members.
Virtual teams are required to achieve the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as liaisons for their immediate physical groups.
Virtual teams may hold meetings based on time zones, but this is often not well understood by local management, so members tend to have a higher level of autonomy compared to traditional team members.
The existence of true "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
"The 'invisible team' refers to the management who are the superiors of each member. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why do organizations desire to undergo the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of practicing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of the organization, there is a possibility for creativity and ingenuity to emerge.
As a result, the process by which the organization collaborates to overcome obstacles can lead to a new and innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create not only the sharing of knowledge and organizational learning but also a culture of innovation.
In 2006, Angel describes the continuum approach as a method that helps organizations reach higher performance levels.
Neuroscientific data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of cognition. This narrows the field of study, allowing for more precise research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been understood that various types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
With the rise of new technology, it has become possible to see and examine brain structures and processes that were previously unknown.
This has enabled us to obtain a wealth of information and materials that will be useful in constructing simulation models to understand human mental processes.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important field in computer science, handling behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation through machines.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
For example, there are functions for control, planning, schedule management, responding to customer diagnostics and inquiries, as well as the recognition of handwritten characters, voice, and faces.
Such things have become a different field focusing on problem-solving in real life.
Currently, AI systems are being integrated into home computers and video game software while being frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
A large part of the classes is field trips. The teacher often tries to take students to places that cannot be visited by a bus trip.
Technology offers a learning method through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, and appreciate beautiful art, all while staying in the classroom.
Additionally, virtually sharing field trips is a wonderful way to look back on the trips and share experiences in future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the state capital, and although the website is updated annually, the old sites are preserved online to be viewed as scrapbooks.
Blogs are also useful for improving students' writing skills. Students who have just started writing blogs tend to be careless with grammar and spelling, but knowing there is an audience brings about a change.
Since students are often the most critical readers, bloggers begin efforts to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing blogs "allows students to become more familiar with the world around them." The necessity to engage the audience's interest fosters students into becoming smarter and more intriguing individuals (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that encourage students to collaborate and expand their learning beyond the scope of traditional classes.
"By appropriately using blogs, 'students' analytical and critical skills improve. By actively engaging with online materials, students are able to define their position within the context written by others and express their views on specific issues' (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the bilingual and captivating capital of Canada, featuring numerous museums and galleries that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south, there is Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untouched natural beauty of places like Muskoka stretches out.
Thanks to all of this, Ontario stands out and is considered a quintessential Canadian province from the perspective of an outsider.
In addition, the wider northern regions have sparse populations, and there are also pristine areas where hardly anyone lives.
A surprising population comparison: The number of African Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of the African continent.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and is a unique continent as a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the small islands are either independent countries or related to France, and there are also famous luxury beach resorts.
Moreover, the Arabs brought Islam to this land, and it was widely embraced in Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope, marking the beginning of European influence and colonialism.
It is a region bordered by the Sahel to the north and surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
It is recommended for female travelers to declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (that doesn't look too expensive) can be effective.
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to behaviors that may be called harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed or have their arm grabbed.
When declining an invitation from a man, confidently maintain your stance with a firm attitude without hesitation (regardless of cultural differences, there is no need to yield to persistent invitations!).
The foundation of the modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was called Anfa. Subsequently, the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinid dynasty used this location as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it, rebuilt it, and named it Casa Branca, but ultimately abandoned the city after the earthquake that occurred in 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Dar al-Badia by the Sultan of Morocco and named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the most difficult places to enjoy shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather products, and hookahs can be easily found, but they are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from Mount Nyiragongo, and most of the streets, especially in the town center, were buried.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you plan to visit places other than Goma, you need to investigate and understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
You can use a bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) for transportation in Goma. The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short distance.
The place name "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land, coupled with the idea that it is a place not easily reached.
Timbuktu today, despite its reputation, is a tourist destination with an airport, but it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger to protect it from the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in the PBS special Wonders of the African World, produced by Henry Louis Gates.
This city has a strong Arabian influence rather than being an African city, and it has a contrasting atmosphere compared to other cities in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, running along the border with Mozambique to the east and with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park spans an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecological zones, each inhabited by different wildlife.
This is one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered a highlight of the South African National Parks (SAN Parks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, this park requires a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
Sometimes it can be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card. It allows entry into the main parks of South Africa or all the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island, as its name suggests, is a territory of Hong Kong and a place visited by many tourists as a highlight of sightseeing.
The skyscrapers that line the horizon of Hong Kong are likened to a glittering bar graph due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is mostly concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This place was considered a territory by the British colonial rulers, so for those looking to find evidence of the colonial era, it would be best to start here.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans mountain range is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a swamp where mangroves grow. It also includes the last places where the vast jungles that once covered the Hindustan plain still remain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water bodies/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is currently home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most buses, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As the shuttle bus often becomes fully booked, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, coaster buses made in Japan operate, and they are all comfortable and sturdy small buses.
For traveling to nearby places like Paro (150 Ngultrum) or Punakha (200 Ngultrum), using a taxi is convenient.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. This bridge over the Oyapock River connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 m tall and 378 m long, and the bridge has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The space above the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011 and did not open until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to fully open in September 2017, and it is expected to be around the time when the Brazilian customs inspection is completed.
The Guarani people are the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing self-sufficient agriculture.
In the Chaco region, there lived groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua people, other indigenous tribes who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay was born in the 16th century through the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples, in what was once called "the great province of the West Indies."
The era of Spanish colonization began, and it continued for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has preserved many indigenous characteristics and its uniqueness.
Argentina is famous for having the world's best polo teams and polo players.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held at the Las Canitas Polo Field in December.
You can watch small tournaments and matches here at other times as well.
For information on the polo tournament schedule and where to purchase match tickets, please check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is fixed at par with the British pound (GBP).
Currency exchange can be done at the island's only bank in Stanley (opposite FIC West).
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are also commonly used in Stanley.
On the remote islands, you can use British and American currencies, but you probably can't use credit cards. It's advisable to check with the owner in advance about possible payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency after leaving the islands, so be sure to exchange it before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it becomes summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and it becomes winter when the Northern Hemisphere has summer.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region, and temperatures above 30°C are common in summer.
It is rare for the temperature to drop below freezing, but due to the wind and humidity, it can feel colder than the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There are no distinct "rainy season" or "dry season," and rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, but they are still wild animals, so you should not feed or startle them.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards (100 meters) from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (25 meters) from other wildlife!
Even though they may seem calm, bison, moose, American elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of tourists get injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance. As these wild animals are large and potentially dangerous, be sure to stay out of their territory.
Additionally, since the scent can attract wildlife like bears, try to avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and aim to maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia is a city that was established in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port is a famous place where in 1889, the navies confronted each other when seven ships from Germany, America, and Britain were refused departure.
Except for one British cruiser, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost in this battle.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, the highest authority, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed at a peaceful gathering held in the town.
Auckland is blessed with two harbors and has many beaches. The popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore Beach (North Harbour area) faces the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beach is sandy and safe for swimming, and the shade of the pōhutukawa trees provides a sun shelter.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, between Mission Bay and St Heliers, which are upscale suburbs in the central part of Auckland.
These are occasionally crowded family-friendly beaches, and various shops line the coast. You can swim safely.
The main local beer is called "Number One." Although it is not a particularly elaborate beer, it is refreshing and has a crisp taste. Another local beer is called "Manta."
French wine is also easy to obtain, but since this is a special trip, let's try wines from New Zealand and Australia.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easily available.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white (with milk)" coffee is a foreign one. A short black is "espresso," a cappuccino is generously topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Warm chocolate is a beverage that meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive, but very delicious.
Trips to coral reefs are conducted year-round, and injuries at coral reefs due to the aforementioned causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow all the signs, heed the advice from the authorities, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish inhabit areas near the coast and estuaries north of 1770 from October to April. They can also be spotted outside of this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily operate in the sea; their main habitat is the estuarine regions of rivers located north of Rockhampton.
If you make a reservation in advance, it leads to a sense of security for travelers, knowing they have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Many travel agencies have contracts with specific hotels, but it is sometimes possible to book other accommodations such as campsites through travel agencies.
Typically, travel agencies offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for transportation between the airport and the hotel, or a combination of airfare and hotel accommodations.
Additionally, if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents (such as a visa) to take to your destination, you can hold your reservation.
However, please contact the travel agency first instead of the hotel directly for any requests for changes or other inquiries.
Depending on the festival, it is decided that the majority of participants will camp at the venue, and most participants consider it to be an important part of the experience here.
If you want to experience it in person, you need to arrive early and secure a campsite where you can easily hear the performance.
Please remember that even after the music on the main stage ends, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals offer special campsites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea during winter, please check the location of your cabin. The noise in the cabins most affected while plowing through the ice can be terrifyingly loud.
The cruise to St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from a visa (please check the conditions).
In casinos, efforts are usually made to ensure that guests spend the maximum amount of time and money there. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
Casinos usually provide special food and entertainment to keep guests feeling comfortable and staying on the premises.
Depending on the venue, alcoholic beverages are offered. However, since judgment becomes impaired when intoxicated, any good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
People driving in high latitude areas or over passes need to consider the possibility of snow, ice, and below freezing temperatures.
Roads covered with snow or ice have less friction, and you cannot drive on them as you would on asphalt roads.
When it becomes a snowstorm, enough snow accumulates in a very short time to halt your steps.
In addition, snow may fall or blow against the windows, and the car windows may be covered with condensation or ice, limiting visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, while snowy and icy conditions are common, transportation continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the best tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight of sightseeing for many tourists.
A safari refers to a land-based journey aimed at observing African wildlife, particularly wildlife in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, so they can be clearly observed using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are unexpectedly timid, so you'll end up using binoculars to see them clearly.
Walking safaris (also known as "bush walks," "hiking safaris," or "walking tours") are excursions that involve walking around safari zones over the course of several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. There are also events that will be held in various locations across Japan.
Tokyo is the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice since its 1964 event.
Those who booked airline tickets or accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced might find themselves in a troublesome situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
The event tickets are priced between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets expected to be around 7,000 yen.
If you iron damp clothing, it dries more easily. In many hotels, even if there is no iron or ironing board in the room, you can borrow one if you ask.
If you don't have an iron or want to dry things like socks without ironing them, it might be a good idea to try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Please be careful not to let the temperature of the dough rise too much (it can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are various methods for water purification, and there are also advanced treatment methods that are effective against specific risks that threaten the quality of drinking water.
There are regions where it boils in one minute and others where it takes several minutes to boil.
There are differences in the effectiveness of filters, but if you are concerned, consider purchasing water in sealed bottles from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pests and diseases unfamiliar to their home regions.
Pests can ruin food, sting the skin, cause allergic reactions in the worst cases, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves and dangerous animals that harm people through force are not usually classified as harmful organisms.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase items exempt from consumption tax and goods tax at specific locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can potentially save a significant amount of money, particularly on items like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult part of the highway connecting Buffalo and Pittsburgh to drive, frequently passing through isolated and undeveloped forested areas.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, please be aware of the steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves, and do not let your guard down.
The posted speed limit is noticeably lower than in the surrounding sections, generally set at 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 kilometers), and it is considered more important to strictly adhere to this speed limit than in other sections.
However, curiously, here there is better cell phone service compared to many other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very delicious, and in Bavaria, they are similar to those of its southern neighbor Austria, with a wide variety as well.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples being used as an ingredient all year round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German pastries use nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. Popular cakes go especially well with strong coffee.
If you want a small, rich pastry, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made by simmering meat and vegetables, based on herbs and spices.
Curry is classified as either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of moisture.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry, while in coastal areas of southern India and the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine, which offers a selection from as many as 17,000 islands, is a collective term for the truly diverse regional dishes found throughout this country.
However, if used without any additional qualifiers, it refers to cuisine from the central to eastern part of Java Island.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine, which is widely spread across the entire archipelago, is characterized by its simple seasoning, and its main ingredients are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
A stirrup is the part suspended on both sides of a saddle to support the rider's feet.
While this allows the rider to be fairly stable, there are safety concerns that may arise because the rider's feet can get caught.
If your foot gets caught in the stirrup at the moment you are thrown off a horse, there is a risk of being dragged by the horse as it tries to run away. To minimize this danger, various safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, fairly narrow soles.
Some saddles, particularly those made in Britain, are equipped with a safety bar that allows the stirrup leathers to come off the saddle if the rider is about to fall and is pulled backward.
Cochamo Valley - Known as the Yosemite of South America, it is Chile's premier climbing destination, featuring large granite walls and numerous rocky areas.
When viewed from the summit, a breathtaking landscape unfolds. Climbers from around the world, surrounded by walls filled with endless potential, continue to establish new routes.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and slide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip, and many enthusiasts known as "ski fanatics" plan vacations centered around skiing at specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very ancient, with drawings of skiers in caves dating back to 5000 BCE.
The history of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
Alpine-style cross-country skiing and activities related to mountaineering are generally not included, and the latter requires more robust skis and boots for climbing and descending steep terrain.
Please think of a ski route as something like a hiking route.
If conditions are good, you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot, but it is very rare to be able to travel at speeds akin to cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a maintained course.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. In normal circumstances, when trying to travel to multiple countries, you often need to apply for visas and go through immigration checks several times.
However, the Schengen Area functions like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this area, you can usually cross the border without undergoing multiple exit inspections.
Similarly, once you obtain a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for visas individually for each Schengen member country, significantly saving you time, cost, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as items that are over 100 years old.
This definition can vary geographically, and in places like North America, the age restrictions may be narrower than in Europe.
Handicrafts, though they have a shorter history than mass-produced counterparts, are sometimes also defined as antiques.
Rearing reindeer is an important means of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding its trade is also significant for many others who have different occupations.
However, the Sámi people have traditionally not been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry; instead, they have led lives centered around fishing and hunting, so reindeer were mostly kept as working animals.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
The word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among people who are not Roma, but it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, it may affect travel health insurance and travel cancellation insurance.
You may consult advice from governments other than your own, but such advice is intended for the citizens of those countries.
For example, Americans living in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory is merely a summary of the security situation in a given country.
The presented views are often superficial, overly simplistic, and generalized compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather refers to hazardous meteorological phenomena that can lead to physical damage, serious social disruption, and threats to human life.
Severe weather can be seen anywhere in the world, and its types vary depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are caused by severe weather patterns such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones, and their impacts.
Severe weather phenomena that are regional and seasonal include blizzards, snowstorms, freezing rain, and sandstorms.
We strongly recommend that travelers recognize the risk of adverse weather conditions that could affect the areas they are visiting, as these may impact their travel plans.
Everyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a conflict zone must undergo specialized training.
When you search for "hostile environment course" on the internet, you will probably find the addresses of local companies.
Courses generally cover the issues explained here in far greater detail and usually include practical exercises.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid, and sometimes training on how to use weapons.
While books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are not uncommon, publications that cover conflict regions are very few.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for identification upon their return.
The government's willingness to issue passports without gender specifications (with the gender field marked as "X") and to update documents to reflect a person's preferred name and gender varies.
The foreign governments' willingness to recognize these documents is similarly very diverse.
After September 11, 2001, inspections at security checkpoints became more intrusive.
It is a mistake to think that pre-operative transgender individuals can pass through scanners while maintaining privacy and dignity.
A rip current is a return flow of broken waves back to the beach, often occurring in areas like reefs or similar places.
Due to the topography of the seabed, rip currents are concentrated in a few deep areas, and fast flows heading towards the deep sea can form there.
Most causes of death are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, but it is probably impossible to swim against the current.
Once you get out of the current, it's not that difficult to swim back.
If you aim for a place where you won't get caught by the waves again, or if you are aware of not being confident in your swimming ability, it might be better to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock can arrive earlier, last longer, and worsen in symptoms compared to culture shock experienced during the early stages of marriage.
Even travelers who can easily adapt to new cultures may struggle to assimilate into the local indigenous culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you lose as much of the customs of your native culture as you adapt to the new culture.
If it's your first international trip, the people around you will probably be patient and try to understand you, because they know that travelers need time to get accustomed.
People may not expect that travelers will require patience and understanding even when returning to their home country.
The Sound and Light Show at the Pyramids is one of the attractions at this tourist site that can be particularly enjoyed by children.
You can see the pyramid in the darkness, and before the performance begins, you can visit the pyramid in silence.
Usually, you can always hear the sounds made by tourists and vendors here. The story woven by sound and light is like a picture book.
The Sphinx is both the background of a long story and the narrator.
Under the night sky, images are projected onto the pyramids, and the pyramids are illuminated one after another.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, have the most bases, and in 2020, there are 16 active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is situated.
There are also places such as Livingston Island and Deception, where a grand natural port is spread out by the flooded caldera of still-active volcanoes.
Ellsworth Land is located in the region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula merge to form a plateau, and then merge again to create the 360 km-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern Sentinel Range, there is the Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica, with Mount Vinson rising to an elevation of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where cell phone signals cannot reach, satellite phones may be the only option.
Satellite phones cannot generally replace mobile phones. This is because you must be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is frequently used by ships, such as pleasure boats, and expeditions that require data and voice communications in remote areas.
Your local telephone company should be able to provide detailed information on how to connect to this service.
Among students planning a gap year, the option of traveling and learning is increasingly popular.
It is particularly popular among graduates who are uncertain about their career path, and by utilizing this, they can take a one-year break before entering university without affecting their academic record.
In many cases, enrolling in an overseas gap year course makes it easier to actually go to university upon returning home.
Normally, there is a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an ideal country for boating. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," Finland boasts thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, yachts are not always necessary.
The coastal archipelago and largest lake are certainly large enough to enjoy yachting, but a different experience can also be had with small boats or kayaks.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, with one boat owned for every seven to eight people.
This is roughly equivalent to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is very rare in other countries (e.g., 1 to 40 people in the Netherlands).
Most Baltic Sea cruises feature an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, you can spend the night on the boat and take 2-3 days to tour the historic towns.
As of 2009, if you disembark using only a shipboard tour, acquiring a separate visa is not necessary.
Depending on the cruise, some brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and city tours are not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially for those who have never been on a plane or have experienced traumatic events.
It's not something to be ashamed of and is no different from personal fears or dislikes that many people have.
By understanding the mechanics of airplanes and their behavior during flight, it is possible to overcome the fear of the unknown and things beyond one's control.
Couriers earn high rewards for urgent deliveries. In many cases, it is important for items like business documents, products, or replacement parts needed for urgent repairs to arrive quickly.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but there were issues on other routes and with smaller companies.
When sending packages by air cargo, it sometimes took several days for them to be unloaded and pass through customs due to air routes.
In order to expedite the process, the only option was to send it as checked baggage. According to the airline's regulations, baggage cannot be sent without a passenger, so what happens afterward is crucial.
Naturally, to ride in first class or business class, you will have to pay a high price commensurate with the service you receive (if it's for a business trip, try negotiating with your employer).
However, it is by no means cheap. As a rough estimate, business class costs about four times, and first class about eleven times, what you would pay for a regular economy class ticket.
Generally speaking, it is pointless to look for discounts on business class or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines charge such fares because they understand that there is a core group of specific passengers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably to their destination.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic country and has been troubled by ethnic conflicts.
The conflict resulted in the creation of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any United Nations member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties are being re-established between these two regions of Moldova.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, which faces the Aegean Sea, is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million people. It has the second largest port after Istanbul and is also a key transportation hub.
It was once the ancient city of Smyrna, but now it has become a bustling commercial hub that is modernly developed, surrounded by mountains with a large bay at its center.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roof buildings, 18th-century markets, old mosques, churches, and synagogues, giving the area a Mediterranean European atmosphere rather than that of traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvik, you can see the nearby island of Eysturoy, and the village has a rare octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, interesting marble sculptures of doves adorn some of the graves.
It is worth it to explore the intriguing village for about 30 minutes.
In the north, there is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron passionately described its splendor.
The Scotturb bus 403 to Sintra runs regularly and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, if you go north, let's visit the Sanctuary (Shrine) of Our Lady of Fátima, a globally famous site for the statue of Mary.
Please do not forget that the place you visited is essentially a massive communal graveyard, and it holds immeasurable significance for the majority of the world's population.
There are many men and women here who survived that time, and regardless of whether they are Jewish, there are also many people who had loved ones killed or forced into labor there.
Please conduct yourself with appropriate respect for the occasion, and behave with dignity and courtesy. Making jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis is absolutely out of the question.
Let's refrain from actions that deface landmarks, such as graffiti with paint or knives on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the people prefer Catalan, a large majority understand Catalan, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, since Catalan is legally established as the primary official language, most signs are displayed only in Catalan.
That being said, Spanish is widely used on public transportation and other places.
Regular announcements made within the metro facilities and on trains are in Catalan only, but in the event of delays due to accidents, announcements are made in various languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, through an automated system.
Parisians are often said to be self-centered, arrogant, and rude.
This is nothing more than an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to thrive in Paris is to behave like a "well-mannered" person and act your best. If you do so, you will be able to spend your time comfortably.
At first glance, Parisians may seem hard to approach, but if you demonstrate basic courtesy, they will likely change quickly.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is a World Heritage site overflowing with breathtaking scenery, featuring 16 lakes both large and small scattered throughout vast forests (primarily beech, spruce, and fir) where alpine and Mediterranean vegetation coexist.
Due to the microclimate, the range of soil and elevation is extremely wide, resulting in a very rich diversity of plant communities.
Additionally, a wide variety of animals and birds inhabit this region.
Rare species such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and capercaillies can be seen, along with many more common species living together.
When visiting a monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries have veils available for women who come without one, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you might earn a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this at the reception by the entrance, but considering that it is not washed for each user, some people might be hesitant to wear it. It is a one-size for men.
Like other regions of the Mediterranean, the cuisine of Mallorca focuses mainly on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and makes extensive use of olive oil.
In particular, during summer, a simple dish called "panboli," which consists of bread coated with olive oil and topped with tomatoes, cheese, and seasonings like tuna, is popular.
All nouns are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence, similar to the word "Sie" which refers to "you."
This is an important method for distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
Since there is a need to examine whether verbs and adjectives are being used in a substantivized form, it becomes somewhat complicated for the writer; however, there is no doubt that it makes it easier for the reader.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively simple, with most words being pronounced literally.
Since pronunciation changes based on the following vowel, the main letters to pay attention to are c and g.
Additionally, caro means "dear," while carro means "tank," so it is important to pay attention to the pronunciation distinction between r and rr.
Persian is relatively easy to learn and mostly follows regular grammar.
Therefore, by reading the introductory section of this grammar book, it becomes easier to learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand expressions.
It goes without saying that if you know any Romance language, you should find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that "Portuguese is a language so similar that there is no need to study it separately."
Observatories from the pre-modern era have mostly become obsolete and have been decommissioned, remaining today as museums or educational sites.
The environmental pollution, which caused the most damage in the past, differed in nature from the issues we face today, as it occurred in urban areas and schoolyards, making it more immediate than modern problems.
Many of the latest research telescopes are installed at large remote facilities so that they can be observed under good atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as "hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms are favored.
The first cherry blossom viewing in Japan was hosted by the Emperor exclusively for the nobles living around the court.
Plants look their best when they are in their natural environment, so please resist the temptation to "take just one" as a specimen to bring home.
If you try to collect "specimens" when visiting a well-maintained garden, you will be unceremoniously kicked out.
Singapore is generally very safe, extremely easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, because it is located a few degrees north of the equator in the "tropical high latitude," it is necessary to cope with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sunlight (rarely, but when it is clear weather).
There are also several buses heading north toward Hebron, a legendary burial site said to be where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Please make sure that the bus you're about to take is headed not only toward the Jewish settlements near Kiryat Arba but also bound for Hebron.
A walk along the inland waterways would make for an interesting theme to spend a holiday.
For example, you might visit the castles of the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise on the Danube River to charming townscapes, or enjoy boating on the Erie Canal.
It also establishes routes for popular hiking and cycling courses.
Christmas is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus and one of the most important holidays in Christianity.
Various traditions related to holidays are being embraced by people other than believers living in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
On Easter night, there is a traditional custom of spending the night in a place with a clear view to watch the sunrise.
Regarding this tradition, of course, there is a theological explanation in Christianity, but it may be related to spring and fertility rituals observed before the Common Era.
In more traditional churches, it is common to hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of Easter weekend, and as midnight arrives, there is a custom where the congregation begins a celebration to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
The animals that originally came to the Galapagos Islands all either swam, flew, or floated there.
Because it is far from the continent, mammals could not travel there, and tortoises became the main herbivores of the Galapagos.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos, many mammals such as goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs have been brought there.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you can experience the "polar night" when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
As this phenomenon causes the sky to be dark for almost 24 hours, it presents a good opportunity to see the aurora.
This area has a sparse population and almost no light pollution, so you can enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal compared to what Westerners are accustomed to.
It is common for suits to be the standard work attire, and for colleagues to address each other by their last names or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and for that reason, we emphasize group efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain their superior's approval for whatever they do and are required to follow their superior's instructions without question.
