This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a quill, but have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers deduced that the quill was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
Removal of structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers believed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chick fluff.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chick's down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The Iraqi study group presented the report at 12:00 PM today (GMT).
It warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this time will stop sectarian warfare, increasing violence, or a slide towards chaos.
The report begins by calling for an open debate and for consensus to be reached in the USA about the country's policy towards the Middle East.
The report is very critical of almost all aspects of the government's current policy towards Iraq, and it calls for an immediate change of strategy.
The first of 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interference and to reestablish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal-like forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke is coming from the power plant.
The residents near the facility were warned by the local authorities to stay indoors, to turn off the air conditioning, and to avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very concerning and that there was cause for alarm due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital staff.
In about a year, an infected person can spread the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
But the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire population group that has tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 out of the total 330,000 infected people in South Africa at any given time.

All the cave entrances, which were named "The Seven Sisters," are between 100 and 250 meters (328 and 820 feet) in diameter.
Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations from night and day indicate that they are likely caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night, they are warmer.
Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stably as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature throughout the day."
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech process: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper, indicating their choice of candidate, into an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that the boxes do not contain ballots at the start of the voting and that no other ballots are added apart from those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Her first was slalom, where she did not complete her first run. 36 out of the 116 participants got the same result in the race.
In her second race, which was the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total race time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's group for sitting athletes did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in giant slalom did not rank in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector-General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused's names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Commissioner of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting to be charged and brought to trial, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have regarded the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists need to be careful if they publish pictures of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders from before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the issues surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control experiment were to be closely monitored by park rangers, as the experiment was supervised and its effect was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director for nature conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
A new provisional electoral council (CEP) consisting of nine members was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEO's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the extensive anti-regime protests, which began in October, was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office reported that no damage had been reported in the nation.
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an elderly lady's place when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the development of the baby’s lungs during the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the federal election in 2010, the number of those who are against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this viewpoint and wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to combat his pain, as they are banned during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed this discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly have been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and especially how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing marriage for persons of the same sex.
He referred to the rumors as "political talk and nonsense".
One wonders if he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, makes it possible for planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on ground radar, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be arranged and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that the team would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would have taken much longer due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn out into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, which were called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical's pH value. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses in the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has provided us with much easier and faster methods of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are several medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of niche, a specific task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young ones.
The females are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides respond much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete that can climb (though not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a series of snarling, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly around. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island, so they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have other features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than had previously been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all. It still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not be able to stand against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate quite a few strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have grand feasts together, where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People made offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their life outdoors.
Women made the food in the yard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living in the area at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the note was simply added as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was governed by the French Vichy government - these are French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1944, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were starting to focus on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people who live together and cooperate, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilization's culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, lasting cultural influence, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government — with Congress as the only component — under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, they relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all actions.
Nor did it have any right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous acceptance from all the states before they could be amended, and the states took such a lax view of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a change in the indigenous grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example, APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in Europe's history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to common citizens.
One of the most important Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are specifically used for this purpose.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being properly adhered to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching their destination. This blockade was in violation of recognized international laws that have been codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a corresponding response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations' attitudes leaned towards pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems, and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Additionally, there was an unstable period with divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was intense war between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful ones to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you are inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the grotto.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE and is one of many large pyramid structures that were built in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'up-arc' mark resembles a V, and the 'down-arc' mark resembles a staple or a square missing its bottom side."
Up means that you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes generally produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the written bow markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows in their carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mafia displayed the head of a royal guard, who was killed at Versailles, to the frightened queen.
The war expenses for American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the majority of expenses, and bond interests ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super-profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that formed the basis for the establishment of the order.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human fate is driven by an underlying logic that is connected to scientific laws, as well as the way they are manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that is hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor-driven car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
When many people own cars, more accidents also happen on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, derived from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose that were related to geography, and these were in harmony with society's location and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
It has been known as an epicenter of luxury since around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1,100 A.D.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most widespread in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, the Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce sufficient food to just meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and give them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children, through neglect, accident, or deliberate negligence, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been deprived of liberty by humans (often their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to question, request, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care, and education, but nonetheless, they do.
We perceive the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
A foster family is tasked with providing all the necessities that were not available in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs, for example.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection.
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not just easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find that you turn off the alarm while sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, which forces you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces one to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses corresponds exactly oppositely to the amount of tension a person holds in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality is. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was expanded by the path of love, Mahayana, and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is brought to life through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the "Deity Yoga." Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a collaboration between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the difference in the countries' systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be seriously fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became almost obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army occupied and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large amounts of both people and goods across the seas.
The navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
As far as known, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could easily access milk, fur, meat, and hides.
House goats were generally kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often overseen by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the tracks only consisted of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the somewhat more uneven roads of the time.
Sleepers were invented quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first tracks made entirely of metal were used.
The first known mode of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like treating symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9, it was read aloud to his soldiers in New York. On August 10, a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving edition of the document. The original handwritten edition no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives. We call them birds.
Most people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g., 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are far too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression originates from old knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that primarily live as parasites on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nidicolous, which means they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the risk of developing MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that it is not best for them or their child to have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume them.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific investigations.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made within physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural, biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments where they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape as well as the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system that is based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a couple of million years, scientists now believe.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do the transportation systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic is also typically fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help in planning, designing, and operating road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the mayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory - some thought that he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because we cannot feel the earth spinning, can we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the earth's second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river and is in some places up to six miles (approximately 9.6 km) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size of their constructions and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed by their ancestors' monuments, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City's population is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they exist in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements. Namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now send messages through computer screens and never need to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only speculate about what will happen to the keyboard when something new arrives.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down with little or no influence.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the back.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what makes people react, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to take certain actions, and which elements in their surroundings cause them to perform or refrain from performing certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two forms of behavior can occur when a manager begins to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the managers and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise are set for virtual teams as for conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their team can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are effectively utilized across an organization's functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models with, which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes making machines capable of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military professional fields as it has been integrated into numerous home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often, a teacher would love to take their students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual tours. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a trip virtually is also a good method to evaluate a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions are still available online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins to strive to improve in writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, "blogging forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written as well as describe their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has a range of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas' untapped natural beauty.
All these things, and more, highlight Ontario as what is considered genuinely Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is sensible to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it's not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but it is very tourist-oriented.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located far to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Despite Goma being reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the conflicts taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Together with the city's relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this provides access either to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings, which, by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a shimmering bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if one is looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining growths of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the inter-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, for example, Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011. It only opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant group of indigenous people who lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies," came into existence in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population groups.
The Spaniards started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Also smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can inquire with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed equivalent to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Overall, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and American currency might be used; ask the owners in advance to find out what payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, it is normal to have temperatures over 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cool: the temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, moose, bears, and pretty much all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that has a strong smell, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the town that resulted in the killing of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most widespread local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for transporting.
It is completely safe to drink the local tap water, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A “short black” is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to the Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but on the other hand, excellent.
Many visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and follow instructions on signs, and pay great attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea; their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers on certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or acquire other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be directed to the travel organizer first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants at music festivals choose to camp on-site, and many participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you need to get in early to get a tent spot close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you are crossing the Baltic Sea in the winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those who are closest.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions), which is nice to know, as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered on the house. But intoxication weakens judgment, and all true gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Everyone who will drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should account for the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is low friction, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and slippery conditions are common in many countries, and traffic mostly flows smoothly all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what attracts the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land journeys to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars, and therefore standard equipment is usually sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "walking safari," or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that last either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may encounter problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothing can help dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have the option to use an iron, or if you don't like wearing socks that have been ironed, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are various ways to purify water, where some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others, more minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not usually perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods at certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers heading to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be alert if you are not used to driving on country roads: there are plenty of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The set speed limits are remarkably lower than on stretches before and after — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them precisely.
Strangely enough, the mobile phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are very flavorful and varied, just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Much German pastry also contains almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand.
If you fancy some small, yet rich cakes, you can try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an overarching term that encompasses a wide range of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
But if the expression is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a series of simply spiced dishes, where the most popular spices are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can present safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, one can take some safety precautions.
Firstly, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars, which make the stirrup leathers release from the saddle if they are pulled backward by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks offer completely breathtaking views from the tops for all visitors. Climbers from around the world constantly establish new routes among its endless potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve going down snowy terrains with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan whole holidays around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings as far back as 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering. The latter is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walk – but it is only very rarely that you will achieve the same speed as in cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a journey through several countries would mean that you have to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area functions somewhat like one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit potentially being lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many Sámi with other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sami kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, and primarily used the reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani population.
If travel advisories arise in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance might be affected.
It may also be that you wish to seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be tailored to their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The consultations are only a brief overview of a country's political state.
The expressed viewpoints are often with a short-sighted perspective on the matter, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious social disruptions or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur throughout the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme precipitation, and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, drifting snow, freezing rain, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risks of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as it could impact any travel plans.
Everyone who plans to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile Environment Training" will likely give the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically last from 2-5 days and will involve role play, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there aren't many publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgeries abroad must ensure they bring valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with an unspecified gender (X), or documents that are updated to provide a person with a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the period since September 11, 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not undergone surgeries should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the beach, often at a reef or similar, is called a rip current.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and there a rapid current to deep water can form.
Most fatalities occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it is not harder than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there is not as much of a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapted easily to the new culture sometimes have a very hard time adapting to their own culture.
When you come home again after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that a traveler in a completely new country needs to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect that it is necessary to show patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is set as the background and storyteller of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and are claimed by many nations, have the most bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains meet on the plateau and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range possesses Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure crafts, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An option that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those leaving school as it gives them the opportunity to take a year out before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place in higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailors. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat reminiscent of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
On most Baltic cruises, an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia, is offered.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, where you return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
It can be a frightening experience to travel by plane for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Delivery companies charge a high price for fast delivery. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they shipped things via air freight, it could have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked luggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger. That's where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put forward a large stack of money for the opportunity (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy class fare for business class and eleven times the fare for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no reason at all to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member states of the UN.
Economic ties have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown of the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the old city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial city located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass facade buildings, and modern shopping centers are surrounded by traditional red tiled roofs, the old market from the 18th century, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some gravestones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was made famous among foreigners after a laudatory account of its splendor by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Up north, you can also visit the great shrine Our Lady of Fatima (altar), which is the site of world-renowned Marian spirits.
Remember, you are actually visiting a mass grave site. A place that has a crucial significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones that were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site with markings or by engraving graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only written in Catalan because it has by law been established as the official language.
However, Spanish is also used a lot, in public transportation and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated through an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible; you should act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make it significantly easier to get around.
The Parisians' cool exterior quickly evaporates if you display basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forest areas - mainly with beech and conifers - and offers a mixture of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here, alongside many more common species, one can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries have scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, it is required that men wear pants that cover the knees.
This can be borrowed from the storage by the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not be completely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses a great deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any kind of available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and adjectives.
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, even though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly ordinary grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to it that one does not need to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are generally outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Viewing blooming cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where blossoms from plum trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so you should resist the temptation to "just take one sample".
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you find yourself in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure to check if the bus you are considering taking goes into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or Rhine Valley, going on a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from all over the world have embraced many of the holiday traditions.
It is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise from an exposed location.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may very well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where congregations often break into celebration at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands got here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not manage the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the first humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since not many people live in these areas, and light pollution is therefore often not an issue, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, and thus emphasizes group effort over praise for individual achievements.
Workers often have to have their superiors approve all the decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
