"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Kamiyaabi key saath baaja bajaney key liye kis cheez ko durust tip nahein samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ezaafi aawaz key liye, jinn kaleedon parr aap martey hein uskey saath zor badhadein.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: **""yaad rakho tumhein kaleedon par ziyadah zor sey ungliyan maarney kee zaroorat nahin jaisa keh tez aawaz key liye piano par maarni parti hain.""** (Remember, you don't need to hit the keys with more force like you do on a piano to get a louder sound).

This directly contradicts option A, which suggests *increasing force* on the keys for louder sound.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **B: Apni salahiyat ko mahfooz karney key liye kam sey kam gair zaruri harkat karein** - This aligns with **""yeah bhee koshish karein keh apni ungliyon key saath ziyadah shiddat key saath harkat nah karein.""** (Also try not to move your fingers with excessive intensity).
* **C: Dheela haath barqaraar rakhtey waqt saazon parr marna yaad rakhein** - This relates to the overall concept of controlled and relaxed finger movement described in the passage.
* **D: Ezaafi awaaz haasil karney liye jiss sey aap ghantiyaan bajatey hein uss key saath raftaar badha dein** -  This connects to **""Bajey par izaafi hajam haasil karney key liye aap ziyadah dabao yaa raftaar key saath kamanon kaa istemaal kartey hain.""** (To get extra volume on the instrument, use more pressure or speed with the bow).



"
"Bajaa bajatey waqt, darjah zail mein sey kiss sey aawaz badhaney mein madad miley gee?","The correct answer is **A: Mazeed raftaar (More speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bajey par izaafi hajam haasil karney key liye aap ziyadah dabao yaa **raftaar** key saath kamanon kaa istemaal kartey hain.""  (To get more volume on the instrument, you use more pressure *or* **speed** with the bow.)

The passage also emphasizes *not* using more force with the fingers (""kaleedon par ziyadah zor sey ungliyan maarney kee zaroorat nahin"") and suggests gentleness (""durustagi key saath ungliyan chalatay huey...ziyadah shiddat key saath harkat nah karein"").  Therefore, options B, C, and D are incorrect.



"
Television parr tasweeron ka bardar keon kata hua hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Takehh tasweer mokammal screen ko bhar dey** (So that the image fills the complete screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah yaqeeni bananay keliye tayaar kiya gayaa hay keh tasveer puri screen ko dhak lay - isee ko over scan kahaa jaataa hay"" which translates to ""It is prepared to make sure the image covers the whole screen - this is called overscan"".  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zailee unwanaat ki ejazat deney keliye** (To allow for subtitle permissions) - While overscan *can* affect subtitles, it's not the primary *reason* for it.
* **C: Takehh deegar wazon mein aasan tabdeeli ki ijaazat miley** (To allow easy conversion in other modes) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Neechey tak bahut qareeb zaili unwanaat ko katney keliye** (To cut subtitles very close to the bottom) -  Overscan can *result* in subtitles being cut, but it doesn't do so intentionally as its primary function.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail kis masalah ka DVD wazaa mein eek movie ko muntaqil kartey waqt kisi ko samnaa karna pad sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Juzwi tor parr zaili unwanaat katein (Subtitles being partially cut off)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that overscan, a common issue when converting films to DVD, can result in the bottom titles (subtitles) being cut off because the television expects a slightly larger image than the DVD provides.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puri screen ko na bharney wali eek tasveer (An image that doesn't fill the screen):** The passage describes overscan as *filling* the screen on a TV, not failing to do so.
*   **C: Mokammal screen ko bharney deney wali eek tasveer (An image trying to fill the screen):** While overscan *aims* to fill the screen, the problem isn't the attempt to fill it, but the *consequence* of doing so – lost information.
*   **D: Barder ko katein (Cut borders):** The passage mentions borders are cut off *to make* the image fill the screen, but the *problem* experienced on DVD isn't the cut borders themselves, it's what gets lost *because* of them.



"
Bartanavi garrison kahaan waqea thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""...General John Cadwalader was to engage the British garrison at Bordentown..."" 

Therefore, the British garrison was located in Bordentown."
Eek haath sey tahreer kardah draft parr kis ki dastakhat zahir hui thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ek haath sey tahreer kardah draft, jis par congress key sadar **jaan hancok** our **secretary charlis thomson** kee jaanib sey dastakhat kiye gaye..."" ( ...a handwritten draft, which was signed by the president of the Congress, **John Hancock** and **Secretary Charles Thomson**...)

While John Dunlap printed the broadsides, he didn't *sign* the original draft. George Washington read it to his troops, and John Nixon read it publicly, but neither signed the original draft.
"
"Darjah zail mahalle waqoo mein sey, dunlop broad side akhir mein kahaan pahunchi thee?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""uss kee ek copy 10 August ko london pahunchi thee."" (A copy of it reached London on August 10th.) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: New York:** While George Washington read it to his troops in New York, the broadside *reached* London.
* **B: Dunlop ki print ki dukaan (Dunlop's printing shop):** The broadside was *printed* there, but this wasn't its final destination.
* **D: Azaadi hall (Independence Hall):** The first reading happened there, but it wasn't the final destination of a copy.



"
Colonel Stark key foji kahaan waqea they?,"The correct answer is **B: Samundar key kinarey eek saahil parr** (On a shore by the sea).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jaldi jaldi ek patthar kee chhoti dewaar say janglay ko shumaal kee jaanib wasee kiya ju ek chhote saahil par paani key kinaray khatam hota thaa."" This translates to ""...quickly expanded the forest northward with a small stone wall which ended at the water's edge on a small shore.""  

This clearly places Stark's forces positioned along a shore by the water (which implies the sea in this context).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baadh key kinarey, shumaali sirey parr** (On the banks of the river, northern end) - While they were near a river (Mestik River), they were ultimately positioned *at* the shore.
*   **C: Jazeerah numa key shumaal mashriq mein** (In the northeast of the peninsula) - This is where the area is generally located, but doesn't specify *where* Stark's forces were.
*   **D: Baadh key saamney** (In front of the river) - Similar to option A, they were near the river, but the focus is on their position *on the shore*.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Stark key logon ney apni baadh mein kabb tausee ki thee?","The correct answer is **C: Kam lahar key doraan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jab jazirah numaa key shumaal mashriqi hissay key saath mestik daryaa key saath nasheebi lahar nay ek khalaa ko khol diyaa, unhon nay jaldi jaldi ek patthar kee chhoti dewaar say janglay ko shumaal kee jaanib wasee kiya...""  This translates to: ""When a lucky wave with the Mestick River along the northeast part of the peninsula opened a space, they quickly expanded the forest northward with a small stone wall...""

This directly shows they expanded their position *during* the wave.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jabb samraajiyon ney kumak bulayee thee** - They received help *before* expanding; the expansion happened *after*.
*   **B: Baqaedah fojiyon key dao chalney key baad** - The text doesn't mention a formal military maneuver preceding the expansion.
*   **D: Jabb fojiyon ney aagey ki taraf position sanbhaal liya** - While they took positions, the expansion specifically happened *because of* and *during* the wave.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon cheen ka sabsey ziyadah pur tashaddud zamanah hay?","The correct answer is **D: Teenon saltanaton ka zamanah (The Three Kingdoms period)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Qadeem cheen kee tareekh mein teen riyasatein sab sey khunreez dauron mein sey ek hay..."" which translates to ""In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms is one of the most bloody periods...""

The text further emphasizes the extreme violence of this era with the phrase ""hazaaron afraad uss ladayi mein jaan bahaq huway"" (thousands of people lost their lives in that battle).

Therefore, the Three Kingdoms period is explicitly identified as the most violent period in Chinese history according to the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khaanah badosh marhalah mein dakhil honey wali chiyontiyon ki colony ki foj mein sey kiya sahee hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh aisey ghonsley banati hein jo 17 dino key baad badal jaatey hein** (They build nests that change after 17 days).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*unn mein sey harr ek khaanah badosh hojum yaa marchez taqriban 17 din tak khatam ho jaatay hain.*"" (Each nomadic attack or march in this phase lasts approximately 17 days.) This directly relates to the nests changing within that timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh raat mein ghonslah banati hein** (They build nests at night) - The passage says they *march* at night, not build nests.
*   **B: Unkey paas khaney ki kam farahami hoti hay** (They have a shortage of food) - This *causes* the nomadic phase, it doesn't *describe* what happens *during* it.
*   **D: Wohh din key doraan march karti hein** (They march during the day) - The passage states they march at night and rest during the day.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah khaanah badosh marhalah key doraan foji chiyontiyon ki caluniyon ki ghonsalah bananey ki aadaton ki durust tor parr akkasi karta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh rozanah ghonsley badalti hein (They change nests daily)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iss marhalay mein colony aarzi ghonslay banaati hay jo harr roz tabdil hotay rahte hain"" - This translates to ""In this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that change every day.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh raat key doraan ghonsley banati hein (They build nests during the night):** The passage says they *march* at night and *rest* to set up camp during the day, not necessarily build the nests at night.
* **B: Ghaonslah banaye begair 17 dino tak wohh march karti hein (They march for 17 days without building nests):** The passage says each nomadic attack/march lasts around 17 days, but they *do* build temporary nests during this time.
* **D: Wohh iss marhalah key doraan eek hi tarah key ghonsley istemaal karti hein (They use the same type of nest during this phase):** The passage specifically says the nests are *temporary* and *change every day*, implying they aren't the same.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon kharjee isharon ki mojudgi key bawajood jaari rahey gee?,"The correct answer is **C: Hayatiyaati ghadiyaan (Biological clocks)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Hayatiyati clocks khud ko barqarar rakhnay waala irteashindah hay jo khaariji eshaaron kee adm maujudgi mein bhee aazadi sey chal rahay chakkar kee muddat ko jaari rakhay gaa.**""  This translates to: ""Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the duration of a freely running cycle even in the presence of external signals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endogenous chakkar (Endogenous cycles):** While biological clocks *produce* endogenous cycles, the clock *itself* is what continues to run.
* **B: Motawatir taalein (Recurring patterns):**  These are observed *because* of the biological clocks, but aren't the thing that persists with external signals.
* **D: Moshahedah kardah taalein (Observed patterns):**  These are simply what we *see*, not the underlying mechanism.



"
Konsi istelaah unn afraad ki wazahat karti hay jo makhsus phenotypic rawayyah key tanawwo ko zaahir karti hein?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaseer shakal (polymorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jab afraad kisee makhsus khaslat key motaaddid qismein zahir kartay hain to woh kaseer shakli (poly morphic) hotay hain"" - This directly translates to ""When individuals exhibit multiple forms of a specific trait, they are polymorphic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hamm shakal (monomorphic):**  The passage defines this as *all* individuals being exactly alike in a specific trait - the opposite of what the question asks for.
* **B: Hayatiyaat (Genetics):**  Genetics is the study of heredity, but doesn't specifically *describe* the variation within a population.
* **C: Parjatiyaan (Species):** A species is a broader classification, not a description of trait variation within a population.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon hayatiyaat ki durust istelaah hay jo eek khaas elaqah par qaabiz hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Aabadi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines *Aabadi* (Population) as ""the collection of specific types of living things within a given geographical area.""** This directly answers the question of what term describes living things occupying a specific area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Hamm shakal (Monomorphic):** Refers to a population where *all individuals are identical in appearance*. It describes a *characteristic of* a population, not the population itself.
* **Parjatiyaan (Species):**  A broader classification than a population. It refers to all individuals capable of interbreeding. The question asks about a specific *area*.
* **Kaseer shakal (Polymorphic):** Refers to a population where *individuals exhibit multiple forms of a trait*. Like ""Hamm shakal"", it describes a characteristic, not the population itself.



Therefore, **Aabadi** is the most accurate term from the passage for a group of living things inhabiting a particular area."
Darjah zail mein sey kon fitrat parr mabni seyahat ki sargarmi ki misaal nahein hogi?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek science museum ka daurah karnaa (A visit to a science museum)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines nature-based travel as focusing on experiencing natural areas, wildlife, and activities *within* those natural environments. 

*   **A: Jharney tak paidal safar (Hiking to a waterfall)** -  This is directly within a natural environment and involves experiencing nature.
*   **B: Jangali phoolon ki tasweer kashee karnaa (Photographing wildflowers)** - This is a classic nature-based activity.
*   **D: Mahi geeri udaana (Going fishing)** - Specifically mentioned as an example in the passage.
*   **C: Eek science museum ka daurah karnaa (A visit to a science museum)** - While a science museum *might* have exhibits *about* nature, the museum itself is a constructed building and not a natural environment. It's an educational experience *about* nature, not *in* nature.

Therefore, visiting a science museum doesn't fit the definition of nature-based travel presented in the passage."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon transport system ki buniyaad nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Insaani irteqaa (Human evolution)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the current carbon-based transport system *displaced* something that supported human evolution for the past two million years. It doesn't say human evolution *forms the basis* of the transport system.  Instead, it was replaced *by* the current system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaam ki manazil (Work destinations):** The passage explicitly states people travel *to* their work destinations.
* **B: Niji carein (Private cars):** The text highlights that the transport system is *based on* private cars (""...aur nijee gaadiyon par mabni transport nizam..."").
* **C: Eek mustahkam hayatiyaat (A stable lifestyle/existence):**  The passage implies a stable existence was what the prior system (supported by evolution) provided, but then was disrupted. It's linked to the foundation of the *old* system.



Therefore, **insaani irteqaa (human evolution)** is the only option that doesn't represent a component of the current transport system's basis."
Nucleus kaa chakkar laganey waley zarrat mein kiss qism ka charge hota hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Manfi charge**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""electrons mein manfi electric charge hota hay"" (electrons have a negative electric charge). It also states that electrons orbit the nucleus. Therefore, the particles orbiting the nucleus (electrons) have a negative charge.



"
Nucleus kinn zarraat sey morakkab hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Proton aur neutron**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nucleus do zarraat - neutron aur proton par mushtamil hota hay."" (The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Neutron aur electron** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
*   **C: Electron aur proton** - Electrons orbit, protons are *in* the nucleus.
*   **D: Proton, neutron, aur electron** - Electrons are not part of the nucleus."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon thoda saa paanch binary number ki misaal hay?","The passage states that a binary number has only two values: 0 or 1.  Therefore, we need to find the option that *only* contains 0s and 1s.

*   **A: 1010** - Contains only 0 and 1.
*   **B: 12001** - Contains the number 2, which is not a binary digit.
*   **C: 10010** - Contains only 0 and 1.
*   **D: 110101** - Contains only 0 and 1.

Since the question asks for *a* valid example, and options A, C, and D are all valid, we must assume the question is asking for a **5-digit** binary number. 

* A is 4 digits
* C is 5 digits
* D is 6 digits

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**.



"
Binary nambaraat ka kiss tarah ki cheezon ka hawalh diyaa jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ek binary adad kee ek yaa do qadrein hoti hain yani 0 yaa 1, aur unn aadaad ko binary digits yaa **bits** key naam sey jaana jaataa hay..."" (A binary number has one or two values, namely 0 or 1, and those numbers are known as binary digits or **bits**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aqdaar (Values):** While binary numbers *have* values (0 and 1), ""aqdaar"" isn't the specific term used for the individual digits.
* **C: Jargon:**  Jargon refers to specialized language, not the components of a binary number.
* **D: Shaklein (Forms/Shapes):** This is unrelated to binary numbers.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska talabah key blog likhney key buniyaadi fayedah key tor parr ebarat mein zikr kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Qawaed aur tahreer ki salahiyat mein taraqqi (Improvement in grammar and writing skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Blog talbah kee tehriri qabiliyat kobhi behtar banaa saktay hain. talbah apni blog naveesi kee shuruaat grammar aur spelling kee ghaltiyon sey kartay hain...""  (Blogs can improve students' writing skills. Students often start blogging with grammar and spelling mistakes...).

This directly identifies improving writing skills (including grammar) as a fundamental benefit of blogging for students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Saathiyon ki tanqeed mein kamee (Reduction in peer criticism):** The passage actually states students *receive* criticism, and try to improve *to avoid* criticism, not that criticism is reduced.
* **C: Gardo nawah ki wasee aagahi (Wider awareness of surrounding issues):** While the passage mentions blogging can broaden awareness, it isn't presented as the *basic* benefit.
* **D: Mosalsal sikhney ki badhi hui khawahish (Increased desire for continuous learning):**  The passage mentions blogging encourages active learning but doesn't frame this as the primary benefit.



"
Blog likhney ka darjah zail konsey pahlu ka talabah key blog likhney ki maharaton ko behtar karney key liye bator moharrik hawalah diya jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ishteraak ki zarurat (The need for participation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Blogging ek aisa tool hay jo *ishterakiyat kee targhib deta hay*..."" (Blogging is a tool that *promotes participation*...) and further explains how this participation helps students learn.  This is a central point of how blogging improves writing skills according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Internet parr mawaad ka kasrat sey jawaab denaa (Responding to material on the internet extensively):** While the passage mentions using internet materials, it frames this as a *result* of blogging – it allows students to analyze and form their own opinions – not the primary driving force behind skill improvement.
* **B: Tanqeed sey bachney parr zor (Emphasis on avoiding criticism):** The passage states students *try* to improve to avoid criticism, but doesn't present this as the main motivator for better writing.  It's a consequence, not a core benefit.
* **C: Apney naazreen key fayedah ko barqaraar rakhnaa (Maintaining the benefit of one's audience):**  The passage doesn't directly mention focusing on the audience's benefit as a driver for improved writing.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Darjah zail mein sey kon talabah ki motazaad mowasilat ka fayedah nahein hay? ,"The correct answer is **B: Dinn key kisi bhi waqt hidayaton tak rubaru rasaayi (Direct access to instructors at any time of day)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that asynchronous communication *replaces* the need for immediate, face-to-face access to instructors.  Instead of waiting for an in-person meeting, students can submit questions and expect a quick response.  Therefore, *direct*, *immediate* access to instructors isn't a benefit – it's what asynchronous communication aims to move *away* from.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits as stated in the text:

*   **A: Bator wasilah internet ka istemaal (Using the internet as a medium):**  The text explicitly states internet access provides 24/7 access to information.
*   **C: Kaam key lachakdaar auqaat (Flexible working hours):** The passage mentions ""lacheelay auqate kaar kardagi key imkaan"" (possibility of flexible working hours).
*   **D: Raftaar control (Speed control):**  The text highlights that asynchronous communication allows students to control their learning pace and the pace of instructional material.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, motazaad mowasilat ka darjah zail konsa pahlu talabah key liye lachakdaar nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Sikhney ki raftaar (Learning speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication *allows* students to learn at their own pace and control the speed of instructional materials. This means the *speed of learning* is something that asynchronous communication makes *more* flexible, not less.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kaam karney key auqaat (Work hours):** The text explicitly says asynchronous communication leads to ""few time constraints"" and flexible working hours.
* **C: Tadrisee mawaad (Instructional materials):**  The passage states it allows control over the speed of instructional materials, making it *more* flexible.
* **D: Internet ka istemaal (Internet usage):** The passage describes how the internet *enables* asynchronous learning and access to information, making it flexible.

Therefore, the only aspect the passage doesn't present as becoming more flexible with asynchronous communication is the *speed of learning* - it's actually enhanced by it.



"
Kisko ebarat mein iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay jaisa kehh koyi aisi cheez jisey koyi shakhs qoroone wustaa key mahallaat sey wabastah kar sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jhooti ladayiaan (False battles)**.

Here's why:

The passage talks about the *imagination* of medieval times – battles, feasts, chivalry, etc. It then questions whether that imagination reflects reality. It asks *why* castles were built and *how* they were designed.  The passage focuses on the *physicality* of the medieval world and a critical look at romanticized notions of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khandaraat key gadhey (Ruins of donkeys)**: Donkeys are associated with medieval life, and the passage *does* mention ruins (khandaraat) as part of the landscape.
*   **C: Bahaduri (Bravery)**:  The passage *implies* bravery through mentions of warriors and battles (even if questioning the reality of them).
*   **D: Shorveer (Warriors)**:  The passage directly mentions battles and the idea of chivalry, which intrinsically links to warriors.

**False battles** represent something *not* directly present in the discussion. The passage focuses on the *reality* behind the *image* of battles, but doesn't discuss fabricated or nonexistent ones. It asks if the imagined battles were truly like that. Therefore, it's the element least connected to the text's core themes.



"
Darjah zail mein kiska ebarat mein iss tor parr zikr nahein hay kehh mahal key baqiyaat mein kisi boo yaa aawaz ko dikhaya jaa skata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ladayiaan (Battles)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions being able to ""feel the sounds and smell of long battles fought between a thousand shields"" and ""breathe the fear rising from the depths of the earthworks."" It also talks about feasts and the sounds of hooves. However, it *doesn't* say you can detect the smell or sound of battles *within the remaining structures (mahals)*. It's a general sensory experience of the battlefield around the castle, not *inside* the ruins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Khauf (Fear):** The passage specifically states you can ""breathe the fear.""
*   **C: Ziyaafatein (Feasts):** The passage mentions imagery of feasts.
*   **D: khurein (Hooves):** The passage mentions hearing the ""clatter of hooves.""



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Kirby Muxloe mahal ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Isey taweel aur barqaraar hamlon sey bachney key liye tameer kiya gaya thaa.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the castle's ""weak walls"" wouldn't withstand *prolonged and severe attacks*. It was built in a relatively peaceful time and only needed to defend against small raiding parties. Therefore, it *wasn't* built to withstand long or sustained attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Mahal ki moti deewaron ki Lord Hastings ney darkhawast ki thee:** While not stated directly, the text implies the walls were *not* thick/strong (kamzor dewarein) and Hastings built it during a peaceful time, suggesting he didn't prioritize strong fortifications. Therefore this is a valid characteristic of the castle.
*   **B: Tameer key waqt isko mulk ki pur aman fitrat ki wajah sey kam sey kam qilaa bandi ki zarurat thee:** The passage explicitly says the country was relatively peaceful when construction began, meaning less fortification was needed.
*   **C: Mahal ki tameer waqt ki muddat key liye aam nahein hay:** The text states the construction began in the 1480s. This is a fact about the time period of the castle's construction.



"
Tameer ki darjah zail konsi khosusiyat ko ebarat mein wazah kardah waqt ki muddat key doraan Kirby Muxloe mahal key liye aam samjhaa jaye gaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuch mahallaat ki banisbat kam qilaa bandi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the castle was built when the country was relatively peaceful and only needed to defend against small groups of roaming bandits. It explicitly mentions the large windows and weak walls were *not* suitable for withstanding prolonged, serious attacks. This indicates the castle's construction prioritized comfort and aesthetics over strong fortifications – meaning it was less fortified *compared to* other castles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Badey darichey (Large windows)** – While mentioned, this is presented as a *weakness*, not a defining characteristic of its construction quality.
* **B: Hamlon sey bachney key liye tameer ki gayi buniyaad (Foundation built to withstand attacks)** – The passage clearly states it *wasn't* built to withstand serious attacks.
* **D: Patli deewarein (Thin walls)** – Like large windows, this highlights a flaw in the construction, not a design choice demonstrating quality.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon aayendah season ki tayyaari kar rahey runner key sabsey ziyadah fayedah mand hogi?","The correct answer is **A: Mosame garmaa mein chalney wali mulk key paar mashq karnaa (Practicing across countries with hot weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that endurance (""sabr wo bardasht"") is crucial in long-distance running, *especially* when combined with training in hot weather (""sum key oopri hissay key liye jamnazim key kam""). It states that training in hot weather is ""behtareen tayyari hay"" (the best preparation) for the racing season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tarbiyat key waqt kaasht kari ki raftaar parr tawajjo markuz karnaa (Focusing on speed during training):** The passage specifically says speed is *less* important than endurance.
* **C: Teen minat key waqt ko beat karnaa (Beating the three-minute mark):** While a fast runner *has* speed, the passage highlights that endurance is more vital, even for record-breakers.
* **D: oopari jism ki warzish karney key liye gym ka istemaal karnaa (Using the gym for upper body workouts):** The passage focuses on the demands of *running* which primarily require lower body and cardiovascular endurance, not upper body strength.



Therefore, option A directly reflects the passage’s key point about preparing for the season by building endurance through training in challenging (hot) conditions."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon pahley darjah key aadha meel key runner key liye bahut ziyadah aham nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Do minat key taht clock karnaa (Breaking the two-minute record)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bay shakk, ek aala paaye kaa half miller, aisa shakhs jo do minton kaa record tod dey, usay ek achhi raftaar kaa maalik honaa chahiye, magar tamaam khatraat mein bardasht ko lazmi ujagar karnaa chahiye.""  (Undoubtedly, a top-class half-miler, someone who breaks the two-minute record, should possess good speed, but must necessarily demonstrate endurance in all hardships.)

This means while speed *is* important for someone aiming for a record, the passage emphasizes that *endurance* is even *more* crucial, especially when facing challenges.  It's presented as a qualification *for* breaking the record, not the most important thing in the race itself.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

* **A: Mosame sarmaa key mahinon key doraan chalney wali mulk key paar ki warzish karnaa (Cross-country running during the winter months):** The passage explicitly states this is *good preparation* for the racing season, implying it's important.
* **B: Raftaar parr kasht kaari ko jhelna (Enduring hardship at speed):**  The passage stresses the need to demonstrate endurance *in all hardships*, so this is important.
* **D: Bardaasht parr raftaar ki kaasht karnaa (Cultivating speed on endurance):** This suggests building speed *with* a base of endurance, which aligns with the passage's message.



Therefore, achieving a specific time like breaking two minutes is presented as something a *very good* runner might do, but the passage prioritizes endurance as the *essential* quality for success in half-mile running."
"Eek khelaadi key liye, darjah zail mein sey kisko akeley gezayi mashqon key zariyah haasil nahein kiya jaa sakta?","The correct answer is **C: Sarkardah karkardagi (Reduced performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that appropriate conditioning exercises *begin* to improve performance and *positively impact* the overall health and well-being of athletes. It doesn't say they *reduce* performance.  In fact, it implies the opposite – they *improve* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Behtar karkardagi (Improved performance):** The passage directly states exercises improve performance.
* **B: Ezafah kardah tafreeh (Increased enjoyment):** The passage says athletes can ""enjoy their sport more"" (lutf andoz ho saktay hain).
* **D: Aam bhalayi (Overall well-being):** The passage states exercises positively impact overall health and well-being.



Therefore, **reduced performance** is the only outcome that isn’t suggested as achievable through conditioning exercises."
"Ebarat kei buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kisko nawjawaan kheladiyon key apney khel mein mazeed tafreeh haasil karney key eek tariqah key tor parr tajweez nahein kiya gaya hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sarkardah satah parr mosalsal karkardagi karnaa (Consistently performing at a high level)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how proper nutrition, hydration, and maintaining a healthy strength balance *contribute* to enjoyment and improved performance. It's about the *process* of becoming a better athlete and enjoying the sport more. 

Option B, ""Consistently performing at a high level,"" is an *outcome* of those things, not a method to *achieve* more enjoyment.  While high performance can *lead* to enjoyment, the passage doesn't suggest striving for constant top performance *as a way to* enjoy the sport more.  It's about the holistic health benefits that then allow for better performance *and* enjoyment.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Durust ghezaa ki mashq karnaa (Practicing good nutrition):** The passage explicitly states, ""Sirf munasib ghezayi mashqon sey aala karkardagiyan shuroo nahein kee jasaktein..."" (Proper nutrition isn’t just the beginning of high performance...).
*   **C: Moassir tor parr paani milaana (Efficiently hydrating):**  The passage mentions ""...badan ko kaargar tariqah sey paani pahunchanay kee aadat daal kar..."" (…by making a habit of delivering water to the body effectively…)
*   **D: Eek sehat bakhsh taqat ka tawazun barqaraar rakhnaa (Maintaining a healthy strength balance):** The passage states, ""Taaqat key sehat mandanah tawazun ko barqarar rakh kar..."" (By maintaining a healthy strength balance...)



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek darmiyani faslah ka runner sazo saaman ka ek mazeed qimati tukda keon kharid sakta hay?","The correct answer is **D: kam qimat waley sazo saaman key ird gird galat tasavvoraat hein** (There are misconceptions surrounding cheaper equipment).

Here's why:

The passage states that while distance running is relatively inexpensive, there are *many misconceptions* about necessary equipment.  Players *feel* they need to prefer certain products, even though those products don't offer real benefits. This implies runners might buy more expensive items thinking they'll improve performance, based on these misconceptions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yehh unki zati tarjeeh hay** (It's their personal preference) - While preference plays a role, the passage highlights it's driven by *misconceptions*, not simply liking something.
* **B: Iss mein sabit shudah fawayed hein** (It has proven benefits) - The passage explicitly says more expensive equipment often has *little or no real effect* on performance.
* **C: Yehh unki karkardagiyon parr bahut ziyadah asar daley gaa** (It will greatly affect their performance) -  Again, the passage argues the opposite - expensive equipment doesn't necessarily improve performance.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darmiyani faslah waley runner ko kiss cheez ki zarurat hay?","The correct answer is **A: Bahut sey saazo saaman (A lot of equipment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""taham shirkat karnay key liye matlub kuchh aalat key taalluq sey bahut si ghalat fehmiyan hain."" This translates to ""However, there are many misconceptions regarding the equipment needed to participate.""  While it also says expensive equipment doesn't *necessarily* improve performance, the initial point is that runners *believe* they need equipment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mustahkam khel walaa pase manzar (A strong game-playing background/scene):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a player's experience or background.
* **C: Bahut kam saazo saaman (Very little equipment):** The passage implies people *think* they need a lot of equipment, even if it's not entirely true.
* **D: Bahut sey paisey (A lot of money):** The passage says the sport is *relatively* cheap, so a lot of money isn't a requirement.



"
Kisney jauhari miqnaatisi goonj ki daryaaft ki thee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch aur Purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI jauhari maqnatisi goonj (NMR) naam kee zohoor tabeiyat par mabni hoti hay, isay 1930 mein **felex blaach (stenford university mein kam karnay waale) our edward porseel (harward university sey)** nay daryaft kiya thaa.""  (MRI is based on the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in 1930 by **Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University)**.)

Therefore, Bloch and Purcell were the ones who discovered nuclear magnetic resonance. Damadian later built upon this discovery to apply it to medical imaging.



"
Tibbee tasweer ki goonj key liye kiss saal mein pahley haqqe tahaffuz ki manzoori dee gayee thee? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chahar saal baad patent manzoor kiya gayaa thaa, jo MRI key maidan mein duniya kaa sub say pehla jaari kardah patent thaa-""  This means the patent was approved four years *after* Damadian laid the foundations for using MRI for medical diagnosis in 1970.  1970 + 4 = 1974.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 1977** - This is the year Damadian built the first full-body MRI scanner, not when the patent was approved.
* **C: 1930** - This is when Bloch and Purcell discovered NMR, the underlying principle, not related to medical imaging patents.
* **D: 1970** - This is when Damadian laid the *foundation* for medical MRI, but the patent came later.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, insaanon key paas deegar logon key jismaani aamaal mein modakhilat karney key liye kiss cheez ki mazboot samajh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Iraadah (Intention)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically highlights the importance of understanding ""doosray kee niyat ko samajhna"" (understanding another person's intention). It then uses the example of someone breaking into a car to illustrate that assuming theft (a negative intention) without considering other possibilities (like losing the keys - a different intention) is a mistake.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Khwahish (Desire):** While desires influence actions, understanding the *intention* behind the action is more crucial for interpreting behavior.
* **C: Yaqeen (Belief):** Beliefs are important, but they don't directly explain a specific *action* in the way intention does.
* **D: Idraak (Perception):** Perception is how we *sense* things, not what motivates someone to *do* things.

The passage emphasizes that correctly interpreting physical actions requires understanding the *why* behind them – the *intention*. Therefore, **Iraadah (intention)** is the most accurate answer.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, iraadah ko samajhney sey insaanon ko kiya karney mein madad milti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Jismaani aamaal key peechey gair yaqiniyat ko khatam karnaa** (Resolving ambiguities behind physical actions).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""yeah jismani aamaal key mumkinah abhamon ko hal karnay mein madad karti hay."" (It helps in resolving the possible ambiguities behind physical actions). The example given – the person breaking into a car – illustrates this. Understanding intention helps you move beyond the initial assumption (theft) to consider other possibilities (lost keys).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Khawahishon ki phesh goyi karnaa** (Predicting desires) - While understanding intention *can* help predict desires, the passage focuses on clarifying *actions*, not just predicting wants.
*   **C: Dusrey insaanon ko begair insaaf key dekhna** (Seeing other people unfairly) - The passage promotes understanding, not unfair judgment.
*   **D: Deegar logon ka dimaagh padhnaa** (Reading other people’s minds) - The passage mentions the ability to read minds as a characteristic of intelligent beings, but focuses on *understanding intention* as the practical application of that ability.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon AI key asal maqsad ka durust khulasah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Miqaat bandi (Scheduling)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states that AI research *includes* scheduling as an example of tasks AI aims to automate. Therefore, scheduling is a *part* of what AI does, not the overall goal.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reflective of AI's core goals:

*   **A: Manbsubah bandi (Problem Solving):** The text directly says AI is about creating machines that perform tasks requiring ""zahanat par mabni ravayye"" (intellectual behavior), which is essentially problem-solving.
*   **B: Awaz ki shanakht (Speech Recognition):** The paragraph lists speech recognition as a specific capability AI aims to achieve.
*   **D: Kaam ki khud kaari (Automation/Self-sufficiency):** The definition of AI given in the text centers around making machines perform tasks ""khudkaar"" (automatically/independently).

Therefore, *miqaat bandi* is a task AI can do, but it doesn't represent the fundamental purpose of AI itself.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zai mein sey kiskey saath AI aksar wabastah rahtaa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Manbsubah bandi aur Miqaat bandi (Control, Planning and Scheduling)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Misalon mein **control, planing our sheedoling**, gahak kee tashkhis aur sawalat key jawabat denay kee salahiyat, saath hee haath sey likhi tahreer, aawaz aur chehra kee shanakht shaamil hay.""  This directly links AI with control, planning, and scheduling as examples of tasks it can perform.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saarif ki khidmat (Customer Service):** While AI *can* be used for customer service, it's presented as *an example* of a capability, not a primary association.
*   **C: Science ka afsaanah (Science Fiction):** The passage states AI *is a strong theory within* science fiction, but isn't *associated* with it in practice.
*   **D: Dasti tahreer ki shanaakht (Handwritten Text Recognition):** Similar to customer service, this is *an example* of what AI can do, not a core association.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon motagayyar ki soch key pattern waley kisi shakhs ki taaqat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Pattern ko yaad rakhnaa (Remembering patterns)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that individuals with this type of thinking (""Taqarubi fikr"") are good at ""patterns ko yaad rakhnay (remembering patterns), masail ko hal karnay (solving problems), and sciency teston par kam karnay (working on science tests)"".  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kisi masalah ka kaseer durust jawabaat ki shanakht karnaa (Identifying multiple correct answers to a problem)** - The passage specifically states this type of thinking operates on the premise of *only one* correct answer (sirf ek durust jawab).
*   **B: Kisi masalah parr nayi taknikon ka itlaaq karnaa (Applying new techniques to a problem)** - While re-using existing techniques is mentioned, the core focus isn't on creating *new* ones.
*   **C: Masayel ko hal karney key liye apnaa waqt lenaa (Taking your time to solve problems)** - The passage doesn't discuss the speed or time taken to solve problems. It focuses on *how* problems are approached.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko motagayyar soch waley tarze khiyaal ki tawajjoh ka markaz nahi samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Kisi shakhs ka waqt lenaa (Taking someone's time)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes convergent thinking as focused on finding *one* correct answer, identifying facts, reusing existing techniques, and gathering information. It's about logic, speed, and accuracy.

* **A: Yehh samajhna kehh sirf eek durust jawaab hay (Understanding that there is only one correct answer)** - This *is* a central tenet of convergent thinking, as stated directly in the passage.
* **C: Haqaayeq ki shanakhat karnaa (Identifying facts)** -  The passage explicitly mentions identifying facts as a key component.
* **D: Malumaat ekatthah karnaa (Gathering information)** - The passage also explicitly mentions gathering information.

However, **taking someone's time** doesn't relate to the core principles of convergent thinking. It's a logistical consideration, not a cognitive process involved in *how* you think to arrive at a solution. Convergent thinking emphasizes efficiency and speed, not necessarily how much time is spent.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko micro izhaar nahein samjha jaaye gaa?","Correct answer is **D: Anguthaa dikhanaa**.

Here's why:

The passage defines micro-expressions as brief, fleeting facial movements lasting only a few seconds. It discusses how these expressions are studied to detect deception. The examples given in the context of detecting deception are subtle facial movements.

*   **Botey waqt jhaanknaa (Looking sideways):** This *could* be a micro-expression indicating discomfort or deception.
*   **Peshaani ko khurachnaa (Scratching the forehead):** This *could* be a micro-expression indicating confusion or stress, potentially linked to deception.
*   **Tezi sey palak jhapkanaa (Blinking rapidly):** This *can* be a micro-expression indicative of stress or attempts to conceal information.
*   **Anguthaa dikhanaa (Showing the thumb):** This is a deliberate gesture, not a fleeting, subconscious facial movement. It's a conscious action and doesn’t fit the definition of a micro-expression.

Therefore, showing the thumb is the only option that doesn’t align with the passage's description of micro-expressions."
Micro izhaar ki tashreeh key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Iss sey kholus ka andazah laganey mein madad mil sakti hay (It can help to assess sincerity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly argues *against* the ability to assess sincerity using micro-expressions, especially in individuals with cognitive impairments.** Oliver Sacks points out the contradiction of expecting someone who struggles with understanding speech to accurately judge sincerity.  The passage even suggests animal-like abilities can be used to interpret behaviour.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Video recordingein aham taraqqiyaat ka baaes ban gayi hein (Video recordings have caused significant advancements):** The passage begins by stating advancements have been made due to video recording.
* **B: Durust tashreeh jhoot bolney ka patah laga sakti (Accurate interpretation can detect lies):** The passage mentions the claim that one can determine if someone is lying based on micro-expressions.
* **C: Baat key saath chehrey key tassuraat ki tashreeh bhi ki jaati hay (Interpretation of facial expressions alongside speech is also done):** The passage explicitly describes the analysis of facial movements lasting only a few seconds during speech.



Therefore, option D is the statement the passage *disagrees* with, making it the incorrect statement."
Ranaisans key natijah key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kon ziyadah aham bann gaya thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Matan ki yaddasht (Memorization of texts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...matan kee yaad aawari kee ahliyat ziyadah tawajjoh kaa markaz bunn gayaa."" This directly translates to ""the ability to memorize texts became the focus of more attention.""  The passage contrasts this with the previous way of learning which didn't heavily rely on individual memorization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fard ki yaddasht (Individual memory):** The passage explicitly states the *opposite* - that individual memorization was *less* important.
* **B: Ilm ka gardish karnaa (Circulation of knowledge):** While the Renaissance *did* lead to more circulation of knowledge, the passage focuses on the *how* of learning, not just the spread of information.
* **D: Malumaat haasil karnaa (Acquiring information):** Acquiring information was still important, but the *method* of acquiring and retaining it shifted towards memorizing texts.



"
"Ranaisans key natijah key tor parr, kam takeed darjah zail mein sey kiss parr ki gayi thee?","The correct answer is **A: Fard ki yaddasht (Individual memory)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Malumat haasil karnay kaa yeah nazariyah mukhtalif thaa- abb infiradi yaad aawari key andar bilkul dabao nahein rehta thaa, lekin matan kee yaad aawari kee ahliyat ziyadah tawajjoh kaa markaz bunn gayaa.""  This translates to: ""This theory of acquiring knowledge was different - now there was no pressure on individual memorization, but the ability to memorize texts became the focus of attention.""

This directly implies that *less* emphasis was placed on individual memory (fard ki yaddasht) after the Renaissance.  The focus shifted *to* memorizing texts (matan ki yaddasht).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ilm haasil karnaa (Acquiring knowledge):**  The passage states the Renaissance *changed* how knowledge was acquired, but doesn't say less emphasis was placed on acquiring it overall.
*   **C: Matan ki yaddasht (Textual memorization):** The passage says this *increased* in importance.
*   **D: Malumaat ki taqseem (Distribution of information):** While the Renaissance *did* affect the spread of information, the passage specifically discusses a shift in memorization techniques, not distribution.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon talluqaat jaari rakhney key liye internet istemaal karney key eek moharrik ki akkasi nahein kartaa hay?,"The passage discusses motivations for using the internet like ""learning"" and ""social behavior,"" and identifies ""personal involvement"" and ""independent relationships"" as boosted aspects.  It focuses on how internet use *facilitates* existing or desired relationships and personal growth.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Karobaar ki networking (Business networking):**  This aligns with forming *independent relationships* – professional connections.
* **B: Kandaan key saath rabtah mein rahnaa (Staying in touch with family):** This directly relates to maintaining existing *relationships* and shows *personal involvement*.
* **C: Safar ki tahqiq karnaa (Researching travel):** While the internet *enables* travel research, the passage doesn't frame this as a core *motivation* for using the internet as much as it frames learning and social connection. It's a *task* the internet helps with, not a relationship or personal development driver.
* **D: Naye logon sey mulaqaat karnaa (Meeting new people):** This clearly relates to *social behavior* and potentially forming *independent relationships*.

Therefore, **C: Safar ki tahqiq karnaa (Researching travel)** is the least reflective of the motivations discussed in the passage. The passage focuses on *people* and *connections*, not purely informational tasks.



**So the answer is C.**"
Darjah zail mein sey kon zaati mashguliyat key liye internet istemaal karney key eek moharrik ki akkasi nahein kartaa hay?,"The passage discusses motivations for using the internet, specifically highlighting ""learning"" and ""social interaction"" as important drivers (James, 1995) and adding ""personal involvement"" and ""independent relationships"" (Agami & Meek, 1998).

Let's analyze each option:

* **A: Kisi nukhah ko dekhnaa (Watching a video clip)** - This aligns with *learning* (if it's educational) or *social interaction* (if it's shared and discussed).  It provides personal enjoyment, thus *personal involvement*.
* **B: Kisi online bahas key board parr post karnaa (Posting on an online discussion forum)** - This is a clear example of *social interaction* and requires *personal involvement*.
* **C: Sehat ki dekh bhaal ki masnuaat ki tahqiq karnaa (Researching healthcare products)** - This relates to *learning* (gathering information) and addresses a personal need, showcasing *personal involvement*.
* **D: Maliyaat ka bando bast karnaa (Managing finances)** - While practical, this doesn't directly fit the motivations described in the passage. It's a *utilitarian* task, focused on efficiency. While it *uses* the internet, it's not *driven* by learning, social interaction, or personal involvement in the same way as the other options.  It's about getting a task done.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Maliyaat ka bando bast karnaa**. It's the least reflective of the motivations for internet use highlighted in the passage.

Maghribi Europe ney kabb asaraat parr bahut ziyaadah bharosa krnaa band kar diyaa aur apney andaaz sey taraqqi karnaa shuru kiyaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Qoroone wusta key ekhtetaam key ird gird** (Around the end of the Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Qoroone wusta key aakhir mein maghrabi europe nay apnay tarz ko taraqqi dena shuroo kiya."" This directly translates to ""Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bazintini ahed key doraan** (During the Byzantine era) - The passage states Gothak style *initially* drew heavily from Byzantine culture, but doesn't say when Western Europe stopped relying on it.
*   **C: Qoroone wusta key taqriban 25 saalon baad** (About 25 years after the Middle Ages) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: 11vein sadee key doraan** (During the 11th century) - The passage states Gothak style *arose* between the 10th and 14th centuries, not that Western Europe began developing its own style *during* the 11th century."
Kapdon ko baandhney key liye button ka istemaal karnaa kis cheez ka natijah thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Saleebi jangein**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Uss waqat kee sub sey badi tarqqiyon mein sey ek kaa wajood saleebi logon key kapday ko jakadnay keliye button key istemaal key chalan ko aam karnaa thaa."" (One of the biggest advancements at that time was the introduction of using buttons to fasten the clothes of the Crusaders.)

Therefore, the use of buttons for clothing was a direct result of the Crusades.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko mahauliyaati masail ka eek qaabile amal taweel muddati hal samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **C: Masail ki wajah ki shanaakht karnaa** (Identifying the root causes of the problems).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...taham agar ham sirf aarizi hal nahein chahte to hamein masail kee bunyaad ko talaash karkay unhein band kar dena chahiye."" This translates to: ""However, if we don't want just temporary solutions, we should search for the root of the problems and eliminate them.""

The passage argues that simply being environmentally friendly (""dostana zindagi guzaar saktay hain"", ""mahauliyati tehreek mein shaamil hosaktay hain"", ""sargarmi"") are often just symptomatic treatments.  To truly address the issues, you need to find and fix the *cause* of the problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Israaf ki tarze zindagi key intekhabaat ka boycot karnaa** (Boycotting wasteful lifestyles) - While helpful, this is a *solution*, not identifying the root *cause*.
* **B: Sargarmi** (Activism) - The passage acknowledges activism, but frames it as often being a temporary fix.
* **D: Mahauliyaati tehreek ka ittehaadi bananaa** (Joining an environmental movement) - Similar to activism, this is an action, not a root cause solution.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail kon sey hal ko mahauliyaati masail key alamati elaaj key tor parr samjha jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **A: Sargarmi mein masruf rahnaa (Being actively involved)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeah bahut sey halaat mein sirf alamati elaaj jaisa hay."" (This is often just symptomatic treatment in many cases) followed by explaining that just being active in environmental movements is a temporary fix. This directly equates being actively involved (sargarmi mein masruf rahnaa) with a superficial, or symptomatic, solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Masail key jadd ki wajhon ko gair faal karnaa (Eliminating the root causes of the problems)** - The passage explicitly states this is what needs to be done *instead* of symptomatic treatment.
*   **C: Israaf ki tarze zindagi key intekhabaat key baarey mein nazriyaat ko aawaz denaa (Raising awareness about choices of wasteful lifestyles)** - While important, this isn't described as merely a ""symptomatic treatment"" in the text.
*   **D: Mahaul dostanah tariqah sey zindagi guzarnaa (Living a life friendly to the environment)** - Similar to C, this is a positive action, but not presented as a superficial fix.

Therefore, the passage clearly identifies active involvement without addressing the core issues as a symptomatic solution."
Europe ki pahli ladayi kiss mulk mein hui thee jiskey markazi masalah key baarey mein kaha jaata hay kehh wohh mazhabi seyaaqo sabaaq ka haamil honey key bajaye hukumat key tawazun sey motalliq thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Spiny jaa nashini kee jang pehli jang thee jis kaa markazi masalah taaqat kaa tawazun (balance of power) thaa."" (The Thirty Years' War was the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.)  The Thirty Years' War *began* in what is now the Czech Republic (then part of the Holy Roman Empire), but was heavily influenced by conflicts involving Spain. The passage highlights that this war marked a shift *away* from religious wars and *towards* wars focused on the balance of power between nations.  While religion played *a* role, the core issue was political and about preventing any one nation from becoming too dominant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bartaniyah (Britain):** Britain was involved in the Thirty Years’ War, but it wasn’t where it *began* or initially centered around.
*   **B: Garmani (Germany):** While the war was fought extensively *in* Germany, the passage doesn't state it started there specifically. It mentions the Holy Roman Empire.
*   **C: Portugal:** Portugal wasn't a primary player in the start of the Thirty Years' War.



"
Kiss jang ki baaz auqaat aakhiri ‘mazhabi ladayi’ key tor parr wazahat ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tees saalah jang (Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""iss taur tees salah jang woh aakhri jang thee jisay mazhabi jang kaa unwaan diyaa jaa sakta hay"" which translates to ""Thus, the Thirty Years' War was the last war that could be titled a religious war.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sau saalah jang (Hundred Years' War):** While having religious undertones, it was primarily a dynastic struggle for the French throne.
* **C: Spain ki janasheeni ki jang (War of the Spanish Succession):**  This war was about who would inherit the Spanish throne, not primarily religion.
* **D: Spain ki civil jang (Spanish Civil War):** This was a 20th-century conflict with political and ideological roots, not a religious war in the same historical context as the Thirty Years' War.

Catholic church key konsey darjah zail pahlu ki chaan been nahein ki jaa rahi thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Aya Church key andar ki daulat ki takhsees munaasib thee (Whether the distribution of wealth within the Church was appropriate).**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...dolat key iss irtekaz nay bahut sey logon ko yeah sawaal puchhnay par aamadah karr diyaa keh aaya yeah osul poraa kiya jaa rahaa thaa."" (This concentration of wealth led many people to ask whether these principles were being fulfilled).  The principle being referred to is that church funds should be used to alleviate hardship and poverty.  Therefore, the question being raised is about the *appropriateness of how the Church was distributing its wealth*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Aya mazhab key buniyadi osulon ki islaah honi chahiye (Should the fundamental principles of the religion be reformed?)** – While questions about the Church might *lead* to calls for reform, the passage doesn't directly state this was the immediate question being asked.
* **C: Church key andar ki taaqat ki markaziyat (The centralization of power within the Church)** - While the passage mentions the Church being powerful, it doesn't say people were questioning *how* centralized that power was. The focus is on the wealth.
* **D: Aya mazhab key buniyadi osul purey kiye jaa rahey hein (Are the fundamental principles of the religion being fulfilled?)** – This is too broad.  The passage narrows the concern to the specific principle of using wealth to help the needy.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Versailles mein kiskaa qatal hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Eek mohafiz (A guard)**.

The passage states: ""Eek moqaa parr bheed mein say eek rukn nay warsayi mein khauf zadah raani key saamney maaray gaye shahi muhafiz kaa sarr lahra diyaa."" This translates to: ""At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in front of the terrified queen.""

Therefore, a guard was killed in Versailles.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko bheed ney badshah aur malekah parr nafiz nahein kiy thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: apney carriage key dareechon ko kholnaa (opening the carriage windows)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the crowd *forced* the King and Queen to open the carriage windows (""Logon key hojum nay badshah aur malekah ko majboor kardiya keh woh apni bagghi kee khidkiyan puri tarah khol den""). This means the crowd *did* exert pressure on them regarding the windows.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Versailles sey achaanak ka khoruj (sudden exit from Versailles):** The crowd's march *caused* the King and Queen to leave Versailles (""Khauf zadah shah lois shanzadham...warselis say waps paris jaaney parr majboor kardiya"").
* **C: Mohafiz key sarr qalam karney ko dekhnaa (seeing the beheading of the guard):** The Queen was forced to witness the horrific display of the guard's head (""Eek moqaa parr bheed mein say eek rukn nay warsayi mein khauf zadah raani key saamney maaray gaye shahi muhafiz kaa sarr lahra diyaa."").
* **D: Paris ka wapasi safar (the return trip to Paris):** The crowd forced them to return to Paris (""aur shah kee bahen...paris jaaney parr majboor kardiya"").



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon bartaniyah key gair rewayati bahri jang ka natijah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Momaasil jangi harbon ko tainaat karney ki jarmani ki khawahish (Germany's desire to deploy wax weapons)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Britain's naval blockade of Germany, which included laying mines in international waters. This caused hardship and disruption of supplies. It also discusses Germany anticipating a similar, unrestricted form of warfare in response.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Momaasil jangi harbon ko tainaat karney ki jarmani ki khawahish (Germany's desire to deploy wax weapons)** - The passage *doesn't* mention Germany wanting to deploy wax weapons. It focuses on Germany's anticipation of *unrestricted submarine warfare* as a response to the blockade, not a specific weapon type like ""wax weapons."" This is an extraneous detail.
*   **B: Gair mashgool jahaz ko noqsaan key andaz mein rakhaa gaya thaa (Non-involved ships were at risk of damage)** -  The text explicitly states that the British mines put ""even neutral ships at risk.""
*   **C: Alami qanoon mein tabdiliyaan ki gayi theen (Changes were made in international law)** - The passage states the blockade violated ""generally accepted principles of international law established by treaties over the past centuries,"" suggesting a challenge and potential shift in those laws.
*   **D: Aham farahmiyaan naqabiley rasaayi theen (Important supplies were inaccessible)** -  The text directly says the blockade resulted in ""military and civilian supplies being cut off.""

Therefore, option A is the only one *not* a consequence of Britain’s unconventional naval warfare as described in the passage.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr bartaniyah key jarmani key khilaaf bahri gherabandi ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Issney yaqeen thaa dilaya thaa kehh fitri jahazon ko khatrey mein nahein dalaa jaye gaa (It assured that neutral ships would not be endangered).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Britain laid mines in international waters, *posing a danger to neutral ships* (""gair jaanib daar jahazon ko bhee khatra lahiq hogaya"").  This directly contradicts the claim that it assured their safety.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Yehh alami qanoon key khilaaf thaa (It was against international law):** The passage states the blockade violated generally accepted principles of international law established through treaties (""bain alaqwami qanoon key unn omuman musallimah osul kee khelaaf warzi hoyee"").
* **B: Issey jarmani ki abdoz jang ko bahdak gayi thee (It provoked Germany’s submarine warfare):** The passage implies this by saying Germany expected unlimited submarine warfare would be the only response given the limited effect of the blockade (""germani ko tawaqqo thee keh gair mahdud aabdozon kee jang kaa bhee wohee radde amal hoga"").
* **C: Issney jarmani ki farahamiyon key bahao mein modakhilat ki thee (It interfered with Germany’s supply flow):** The passage explicitly states the blockade cut off military and civilian supplies to Germany (""haiwi askari aur civilian rasad munqata ho gayee"").

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kinkey liye motaddid amraaz ki tashkhisaat sabsey ziyadah mumkin hogi?","The passage states that multiple sclerosis (motaddid amraaz) is twice as likely to occur in women than in men.  Therefore, the most likely diagnosis would be for a woman.

Looking at the options:

* **A: Eek 32 salah khatun (A 32-year-old woman)** - This is the most likely candidate.
* B: Eek 15 salah mard (A 15-year-old man) - Less likely, as the disease primarily affects young adults and middle-aged adults, and is less common in men.
* C: 43 salah mard (A 43-year-old man) - Less likely due to the gender disparity.
* D: 10 salah khatun (A 10-year-old woman) -  Less likely, as the disease primarily affects young adults and middle-aged adults.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Eek 32 salah khatun**.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baqaedah sargargi mein shirkat karney walon ko kiss cheez keliye mazeed himaayat ki zarurat thee?","The correct answer is **A: Dard ka manfi tasavvur (Negative pain perception)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*Baqayedgi say sargarmiyon mein hissah lenay waalon ko mamool kee jismani naql wo harkat say honey waale daaimi dard aur takleef key ehsaas key darmiyan farq ko eyaan karnay waale dard key manfi tasavvur key lehaaz say ziyadah madad kee zaroorat hoti hay.*"" 

This translates to: ""...Participants engaging in regular activities needed more support in terms of *negative pain perception*, i.e., differentiating between normal physical sensations and constant pain and discomfort.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nichli pusht (Lower back):** The passage is *about* lower back pain, but doesn't say participants needed more support *specifically* for their lower backs.
*   **C: Zahni dabao (Mental pressure):** While sadness, fear, and distress are mentioned, the passage specifically highlights the need for help with understanding pain perception.
*   **D: Khauf (Fear):**  Fear is mentioned, but the passage focuses on the ability to distinguish between normal sensations and pain, which is related to perception, not just fear itself.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baad bananey ka kaam aam tor sey kaisey anjaam diya jaata hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek duel shakal mein** (In a duel format).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah sport awwaleen taur say **eek doel kee shakal mein** khela jaataa hay jis mein eek shamsheer baaz dosray say do bado muqabilah karta hay.""  This translates to ""This sport was originally played in a **duel format** where a fencer competes against another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek jadid shakal mein** (In a modern format) - While the passage mentions a *modern* form of the sport, it doesn't say that's how bouts *are usually* formed. It's a contrast to the original.
* **B: University ki satah parr** (At the university level) - The passage mentions universities, but not as the *usual* way bouts are conducted.
* **C: Olympic ki satah parr** (At the Olympic level) - Similar to university level, Olympics are mentioned as a competition venue but not the *format* of the bout.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey ko internet ki zahar khurani ka sabsey mazboot nishandahi karney wala hoga?","The correct answer is **D: Eek nuskhah ki goli ka bottle** (A bottle of prescription pills).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Androni zaharkhuri kee behtareen nishandahi adviyaat yaa zahrile ghareloo kimiyayi ajzaa kee khule bottle kee maujudgi hosakti hay.**"" (The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of open bottles of medicines or poisonous household chemicals).

Options A, B, and C describe *symptoms* which the passage says are common and don't necessarily indicate poisoning. The presence of a pill bottle is a direct indicator that poisoning *might* have occurred.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi motassirah ki tashkhees kartey waqt pahla munasib qadam kiya hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Manzar ka mushahidah karnaa (Observing the scene)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haadsah key shikaar fard kee jaanch say pehle apni hifazat key liye jaye haadsah kaa jaizah len.""  This translates to: ""Before approaching an accident victim, assess the scene to protect yourself.""

This clearly indicates that the *first* appropriate step when dealing with a potential victim is to **observe the scene** (take an assessment of the accident) to ensure your own safety.  The passage emphasizes self-preservation *before* approaching.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motassirah tak pahuchnaa (Reaching the victim):** The passage specifically advises *against* immediate approach.
* **C: Motassirah ki position ki jaanch karnaa (Checking the victim’s position):** You can’t safely do this until you've assessed the scene.
* **D: Madad key liye intezaar karnaa (Waiting for help):** While calling for help is important, the passage focuses on your *initial* action – assessing the situation for *your* safety.



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr motassirah ki jaanch karney key amal ki akkaasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Motassirah ki position ka mushahedah karein** (Observe the victim's position).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes assessing the situation for *your own* safety before approaching a victim.**  Understanding the victim's position – are they trapped, are they near further danger, how are they lying – is crucial to evaluating the overall scene and determining if *you* can safely approach and help.  This is part of the ""mutissirah kee haisiyat ko dekhna zarwi hay"" (it is necessary to see the situation of the victim) mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apney zakhmon ki taab laaney ki fikar na karein** (Don't worry about bearing your wounds) – This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises.  The passage stresses self-preservation *first*.
* **B: Motassirah key saamney manzar ka andazah lagayein** (Estimate the scene in front of the victim) – While assessing the scene is important, it’s the *victim’s immediate surroundings and position* that directly impact your safety when approaching.
* **D: Kisi bhi surkh jhnadon ka notice leney ki koshish karein** (Try to notice any red flags) –  Red flags are part of the scene assessment, but observing the victim's position is the first step in understanding the immediate danger.



"
Farancisi inqilaab sey paida honey wali konsi tabdiliyon ka kaam gaar tabqah key shahriyon parr ahem asar thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Tabqah sey qabiliyat ki taraf muntaqili** (Shift from class to merit).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""fauj kee ranking cliss parr mabni honey key bajaye abb calber parr mabni hoti hay"" which translates to ""the army's ranking is now based on caliber (merit) rather than class."" This directly relates to a shift from inherited status (class) to demonstrated ability (merit).  The passage also mentions opportunities opening up for talented individuals (""intehayi pur ummeed aur kamiyab afraad ko kamiyabi haasil karnay kaa moqaa milaa""). This is a direct consequence of meritocracy.
* **Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: Mulk key liye himaayat mein ezaafah ho gaya** (Increased support for the country) - While likely a result of the revolution, it isn't a specifically *caused* change mentioned in relation to the working class.
    * **C: Jamhuri nazariyah ko ikhtiyaar karnaa** (Adopting republican ideology) - The passage mentions a shift *towards* republicanism, but doesn't tie that specifically to the impact on the working class.
    * **D: Eek naya paimaehs karney ka system** (A new measurement system) - The mention of the metric system is a separate point and doesn't relate directly to the working class or their societal mobility.



Therefore, **B** is the most directly supported answer by the text, as it describes a fundamental change benefiting those previously disadvantaged by their social standing."
"Farancisi inqilaab key baad, foj aur deegar peshon mein kamiyaabi ka kiss cheez parr mabni honey ka kam imkaan thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Salahiyat (Capability/Caliber)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wohee cheez fauj parr lagoo hoti hay keunkeh fauj kee ranking cliss parr mabni honey key bajaye abb calber parr mabni hoti hay.""  This directly translates to: ""The same applies to the army because the army's ranking is now based on *caliber* rather than class.""

The passage also mentions that after the revolution, professions were opened to all talented men (""intehayi pur ummeed aur kamiyab afraad ko kamiyabi haasil karnay kaa moqaa milaa""), implying success was based on ability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hosulyaabi (Achievement):** While achievement is a *result* of capability, it isn't the basis *upon which* success was determined.
*   **B: Tabqah (Class):** The passage explicitly states the army moved *away* from class-based ranking.
*   **C: Azam (Greatness/Highest Rank):**  This doesn't explain the shift in how success was measured.



"
Konsi awaami khidmat key baarey mein kaha jaata hay kehh wohh taraqqi yaaftah mamalik mein bahut ziyadah bechaini ki wajah thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Awami transport (Public transport)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Taraqqi yaaftah mamalik mein aap kabhi kabhaar aabi meyaar yaa palon key girnay key baaray mein isee tarah kee shikayatein suntay hain"" (In developed countries, you sometimes hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses in the same way).  However, it *then* focuses on the widespread complaints about *transportation* systems. The question asks what public service causes a lot of unrest in developed countries, and based on the passage's framing, that's public transport.

The passage is posing the question *why* transportation systems generate so many complaints, despite being universally used. This makes public transport the central focus of the discussion.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, awami transportation system key baarey mein kiya kaha jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh unko istemaal karney walon ki bahut si shikayaton ki wajah hein** (They are the cause of many complaints from those who use them).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *almost everyone complains about the transportation system*, even though *everyone uses it*.  This directly points to the transportation system being the source of many complaints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unka istemaal karney wala har shakhs unsey achey sey mohabbat karta hay** (Everyone who uses them loves them) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage says.
* **B: Wohh paani key meyaar ki tarah kharaab nahein hein** (They are not as bad as water standards) - The passage *compares* transportation problems to water standards, implying they *are* problematic, not that they aren't.
* **D: Bahut sey taraqqi yaaftah mamalik mein wohh muft hein** (They are free in many developed countries) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of transportation.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, drivers ki gair motawaqqayiat ki wajah sey darjah zail mein sey kiska paimaanah karnaa mushkil ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Traffic ki rawani (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Badqismati say traffic kee rawani kaa mutalah bahut mushkil hay keunkeh driver key rawayyah kee peshin goyee sau fisadi yaqeeni key saath nahein kee jasakti hay."" (Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is very difficult because the prediction of driver behavior cannot be made with 100% certainty.)

This directly links the difficulty in studying/measuring traffic flow to the unpredictable nature of drivers.  The other options – road planning, road operations, and traffic speed – are things that *benefit* from understanding flow, but aren't directly hindered by driver unpredictability in the same way that measuring the flow itself is.



"
Riyaazi tor parr kisi traffic ki rwani ki nomaindagi kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kiska istemaal kiya jata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Traffic ki kasafat (Traffic Density)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the relationship between **flow, density**, and a third factor are used to better represent traffic flow.  It mentions these relationships help with planning, design, and operating roadways.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sadak ki amaliyaat (Road Operations):** While road operations *influence* traffic flow, they aren't a direct mathematical representation *of* the flow itself.
*   **B: Driver key soluk (Driver Behavior):** The passage *acknowledges* driver behavior is difficult to predict perfectly, making it unreliable for a purely mathematical model.  While it impacts flow, it's not the core representation.
*   **C: Sadak ka naqshah (Road Map):** A road map describes the *structure* of the traffic system, not the flow *within* it.

The passage focuses on the mathematical relationship between flow and **density** as a key component of modeling traffic. Therefore, density is the mathematically represented element."
Hershey aur Chase ney apney DNA ki pewand kaaree karnay key liye kiya istemaal kiya thaa? ,"The correct answer is **D: Viruses**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Hershey and Chase used **jaraseem khoron, yaa viruses** (which translates to bacteriophages, or viruses) to help the DNA of a bacteria replicate. They didn't *use* radioactive phosphorus or sulfur directly for replication, but rather *labeled* the DNA or protein with these elements to track which one entered the bacteria.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radio active phosphorce:** They used radioactive phosphorus to *label* DNA, but viruses were the tool used to transfer genetic material.
*   **B: Jinyati maaddah:** (Genetic material) This is what they were trying to identify, not what they used.
*   **C: Radio active sulfur:** They used radioactive sulfur to *label* protein, not as the primary means of transfer.



"
Kisi taghayyur ki bachon tak muntaqil honey ki salahiyat kiss cheez parr munhasir hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Agar khaliye jarsimi line hon** (If the cells are germline).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sirf jarasimi line key khaliyon mein honey waale taghayyuraat ko bachon tak muntaqil kiya jasakta hay..."" (Only mutations occurring in germline cells can be passed on to offspring).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jinyati mawaad ki ahmiyat (The importance of genetic material):** While genetic material *contains* the mutations, the material itself doesn't determine if a mutation is heritable.
* **C: Taghayyur ki qism (The type of mutation):** The type of mutation is a factor, but it's *where* the mutation occurs (germline vs. somatic) that's the primary determining factor for heritability.
* **D: Agar taghayyur khaliyah ki maut ka sabab ho sakta ho (If the mutation could cause cell death):** Mutations that cause cell death are *not* passed on; the passage contrasts these with mutations in germline cells.



"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, taghayyuraat key motaddid asaraat kis parr munhasir nahein hotey hein?","The correct answer is **A: jitna jinyati maaddah motassir hua hay (how much genetic material is affected)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that mutations can have different effects. It specifically says mutations in germline cells *can* be passed to offspring, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.  This implies the *extent* of genetic material affected is crucial. A mutation affecting a large portion of genetic material is more likely to have a severe (like cell death or cancer) versus a minor impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar motassirah khaliye jarasimi line hon (If the affected cells are germline cells):** The passage *describes* what happens if cells are in the germline, it doesn't limit the effects to only that case.
* **C: Motassirah jinyati maaddah ki ahmiyat (The importance of the affected genetic material):** While the importance of the gene is a factor, the passage focuses on *where* the mutation occurs (germline vs. other cells) and the extent of the change.
* **D: Motassirah taghayyur ki qism (The type of mutation affected):**  The passage notes there are ""different types"" of effects, but doesn't say effects are limited by mutation *type*.



"
Darjah zail mien sey kon iss baat ki wajah nahein hay kehh qadeem saqafaton mein bakriyaan rakhi jaati theen?,"The correct answer is **C: Unhoney ney suhbat pesh ki** (They provided companionship).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the reasons ancient cultures kept goats:

*   **A: Wohh gosht tak rasayi faraham kartey they** (They provided access to meat) - Mentioned as ""gosht"" in the text.
*   **B: Wohh zameen mein charaaney mein madad kartey they** (They helped in grazing the land) - Implied by being herded in mountains and pastures (""chara gaahon"").
*   **D: Unhoney doodh tak rasayi faraham ki** (They provided access to milk) - Mentioned as ""doodh"" in the text.

However, the passage *does not* mention companionship as a reason for keeping goats. It focuses on their practical benefits as a source of food (milk, meat) and materials (skin).

Therefore, **C** is the answer that is *not* a reason given in the text."
Golf ka maqsad kis cheez ki kam sey kam miqdaar ko lenaa hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Stokes**.

The passage states: ""Woh khiladi jo corse jeetnay key liye sab say kam stroke lagaata hay..."" (The player who takes the fewest strokes to win the course...)

Therefore, the goal of golf is to take the fewest strokes."
"Eek golf corse parr, ghaas ko kahan parr ziyadah chota kata jaata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sabz parr** (on the green).

The text explicitly states: ""Woh khiladi jo surakh key ird gird kee ghas ko thodi der pehle hee kata gayaa hota hay aur isay sabz kehtay hain."" (The grass around the hole is cut short and is called the green.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Attharahvein hole mein** - The text just mentions finishing on the 18th hole, not specifically about the grass there.
*   **C: Pahley hole mein** -  Similar to A, it only mentions starting on the first hole.
*   **D: Corse key pahley nisf parr** - The text doesn't state that only the first half of the course has short grass.



"
Kisi tajarbah ka aam maqsad kiya hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek yaa ziyadah mumkanah mafruzey ko kahtam karnaa (To eliminate one or more possible hypotheses)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""tajrib yaa tajarbah woh test yaa ekhtiyar hay jis key zariah eek yaa zayed mafruzat ko rad kiya jaataa hay"" - which translates to ""an experiment or experience is a test or option by which one or more hypotheses are rejected"".  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ye malum karnaa kehh duniya kaisey kaam karti hay (To find out how the world works):** While ultimately science *aims* to understand how the world works, a single experiment doesn't do that directly. It tests specific ideas about how the world works.
* **C: Sawalaat laahiq karnaa (To raise questions):** Experiments often *lead* to questions, but their primary *purpose* isn't to simply ask questions.
* **D: Sciency tahqiqi ki rahnumayi karnaa (To guide scientific research):** Experiments are *part* of scientific research, but they don't *guide* the entire process; they are a tool within it.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sciency tahqiqi ki rahnumayi karney mein kiss sey madad nahein milti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Akelaa sciency tariqah kaar** (Only the scientific method).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Science daanon kaa khaas hadaf scientific tariqah say yeah malum karnaa hay keh duniya kaisay kam karti hay... Yeah akelay kaafi nahein, tajrib yaa tajarbah... sawalat tashkil diye jaatay hain, moshahedat key endraj say bhee sciency research mein rehnumayi milti hay.""

This translates to: ""The main goal of scientists is to learn how the world works through the scientific method... This alone is not enough; experimentation, formulating questions, and recording observations also guide scientific research.""

The passage explicitly states the scientific method *alone* is **not sufficient** to guide scientific research. It needs to be supplemented by experimentation, observation, and forming questions. 

The other options are all mentioned as things that *do* help guide scientific research:

*   **B: Moshahidaat karnaa** (Making observations) - Directly mentioned as helpful.
*   **C: Mumkanah mafruzey khatam karnaa** (Eliminating possible hypotheses) - This is the purpose of experimentation, which is mentioned.
*   **D: Tajarbaat karnaa** (Conducting experiments) - Directly mentioned as helpful.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, toofanon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Ziyadah tarr toofan teen ghanton sey ziyadah rahtey hein** (Most tornadoes last more than three hours).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""sab say ziyadah shadeed do fisad toofan teen ghantay say ziyadah tak rehte hain"" (The most intense two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours). This means *only* the most intense 2% last longer than three hours, not most tornadoes in general.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Toofan apney gardo nawaah mein har cheez ko tabaah karney ki salahiyat rakhtey hein** (Tornadoes have the potential to destroy everything in their path) -  The passage states they can ""tabaah karsakte hain"" (destroy) everything in their path.
* **B: Toofane gardo baad deegar toofanon sey chotey elaqon ko zad mein letey hein** (Tornadoes affect smaller areas compared to other storms) - The passage starts by saying ""Toofan deegar jarehana aandhiyon kee nisbat eek chhote elaqay ko apna nishanah banatay hain"" (Tornadoes, compared to other storms, target a smaller area).
* **D: Kuch toofanon mein 300 meel fee ghantah tak ki hawayein ho skati hein** (Some tornadoes can have winds up to 300 miles per hour) - The passage states ""480 kilometer/ghantah (133 meal/second; 300 meter fee ghantah) tak kee hawayein mojud hain"" (winds of up to 480 kilometers/hour (133 miles/second; 300 meters/hour) can exist).

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr ziyadah tar toofanon ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Wohh aam tor parr teen ghantey jaari rahtey hein (They generally last for three hours)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""sab say ziyadah shadeed do fisad toofan teen ghantay say ziyadah tak rehte hain"" (The most severe tornadoes last more than three hours).  While it doesn't say *all* tornadoes last three hours, it highlights this as a characteristic of the *most severe* ones, implying it's a common duration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wohh 480 meel fee ghantah key ird gird ki hawayein paida kartey hein (They produce winds around 480 miles per hour):** The passage says winds *can* reach this speed in *great* tornadoes, but it doesn't state this is typical of *most* tornadoes.
* **C: Wohh deegar toofanon sey baday elaqon ko motassir kartey hein (They affect larger areas than other storms):** The passage actually says the opposite - tornadoes target *smaller* areas.
* **D: Wohh darakhton kon zameen sey ukhaadney ki salahiyat rakhtey hein (They have the ability to uproot trees from the ground):** This is a *result* of a tornado's power, not a defining characteristic of *most* tornadoes.  Many tornadoes might not be strong enough to uproot trees.



"
16vein sadee mein insano ney darjah zail mein sey kisko karnaa shuru kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Doorbeenein bananaa** (Making telescopes).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the *first actual telescope* was made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.  While people had been making and using lenses for thousands of years, the *telescope* as we know it – a device specifically for magnifying distant objects with a lens system – was a new development in the 16th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lense istemaal karnaa (Using lenses):**  People had been using lenses for *thousands* of years, not just starting in the 16th century.
*   **B: Ashyaa ko bada karnaa (Magnifying objects):**  Lenses could magnify, but the passage focuses on the *invention of the telescope* to do this, which is what began in the 16th century.
*   **C: Lense banana (Making lenses):**  Again, lens making predates the 16th century by millennia.



"
Lense istemaal karkey insaan kab tak ashyaa ko bada kartey rahe hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Hazaron salon tak**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Insaan hazaaron barson say bari beenayi key liye chashme banatay rahay hain aur isay istemaal kartay rahay hain"" which translates to ""Humans have been making glasses for magnification for thousands of years and have been using them.""

Therefore, the answer is ""thousands of years"". Options A and C are the same, and C is the correct one."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, Muhammad ka ghaar unkey ruhaani aamal yaa aqdaar key baarey mein kiya kahtey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Shoro sahgab sey baahar moraqabah mein madad mil sakti hay (Being away from the hustle and bustle helps in meditation/contemplation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states Muhammad went to the cave of Hira for *tafakkur wo tadabbur* (contemplation and reflection).**  The description emphasizes the *isolation* and *separation from the world* within the cave. This strongly suggests he sought a place conducive to spiritual practice.
* The passage highlights the cave’s remoteness and how little of the worldly life could be seen or heard from within, facilitating deep spiritual focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh sokun aur yaksui ki qadar kartey hein (They valued peace and solitude):** While true, this is a *result* of his actions, not the primary thing the passage *says* about his spiritual practice. The passage focuses on *where* and *how* he sought this peace.
* **C: Unko bahut kam tanhayi key waqt ki zarurat thee (They needed a lot of alone time):** The passage doesn’t say he *needed* alone time, but that he *chose* a very isolated place for spiritual activities.
* **D: Wohh dikhney aur suney janey sey parishaan they (They were disturbed by seeing and hearing things):**  The passage doesn’t imply he was *disturbed* by the world; it emphasizes he sought to *distance* himself from it for spiritual clarity.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, lohey ko sabsey pahley kis cheez key liye istemaal kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Patriyiaan (Rails)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cross ties kaa istemaal shuroo key daur mein kiya gayaa thaa taakeh patriyan apni jagah parr saabit rahein. lekin tadrijan mohaqqaq kiya gayaa keh agar inn key oper iron kee step lagaa di jaye to patriyan ziyadah kaar aamad hon gee.""  

This translates to: ""Cross ties were used in the early stages to keep the rails in place. But gradually it was discovered that if an iron step was placed on them, the rails would be more effective.""

Therefore, iron was first used to improve the rails (patriyan), not the cross ties, carts, or wheels.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, lakdi ki pahiyon ko lohey ki pahiyon sey keon tabdil kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Unko patriyon parr lohey key zariyah nichey pahnaya jaa rahaa thaa (They were being worn down on the rails due to the iron)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""lekin lohay kee wajah say lakdi kee gaadiyon key pahiyon mein ziyadah zeebaish kee jaaney lagi.""  This translates to ""but due to the iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons began to wear down more.""  This directly explains *why* they were replaced – the iron rails were damaging the wooden wheels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unsey ghodon ki raftaar badh gayi thee (They increased the speed of the horses)** - The passage mentions wooden wheels *helped* with speed initially, but doesn't say replacing them was to further increase speed.
* **B: Unko ziyaadah umdah samjha jaata thaa (They were considered superior)** - The passage doesn't state that iron wheels were inherently considered better, only that they became necessary due to wear.
* **C: Wohh bady bojhon ko sanbhalney key qaabil theen (They were capable of handling heavy loads)** - While the original wooden wheels with cross ties were good for heavier loads on bad roads, the reason for the switch wasn't to increase load capacity.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, roomaniyat key zamanah key doraan afraad ki kiss cheez ki shakal bani thee?","The correct answer is **B: Jografiyah**.

The text explicitly states: ""**Romanawiyat mein, jografiye nay afraad ko dhaala...**"" which translates to ""**In Romanawiyat, geography shaped individuals...**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qanoon (Law):** While the text mentions laws, it states that traditions and culture tied to geography were *better than* those laws.
* **C: Rewaaj (Tradition):** Traditions are a *result* of geography and culture, not the primary shaper of individuals according to this text.
* **D: Saqafat (Culture):** Culture is also a result, closely linked to geography, but geography is presented as the initial shaping force.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyaan takniki azam key aam khiyaal ki akkasi nahein karta hay? ,"The correct answer is **B: Taknik ki taraqqi saqafat key zere asar motassir nahein hoti hay** (Technology's progress is not influenced by culture).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that technical determinism (Techniquee tayyun kaa nazariyah) argues technology develops *independent* of cultural or political influence.  It says technology follows a path ""bala tar"" (superior/above) cultural or political effects.  Option B directly contradicts this core tenet of the theory.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

*   **A: Samaaj parr taknik key asaraat samaaji tor parr mashrut hotey hein** (The effects of technology on society are socially conditioned) - The passage argues *against* this, saying the effects are more ""maurusi"" (inherent/automatic) rather than socially conditioned. However, the question asks for what the theory *doesn't* reflect, and this is a closer point of contention than B.
*   **C: Taknik key samaaj parr zati asaraat hotey hein** (Technology has inherent effects on society) - The passage supports this; it describes how the car led to roads, then more cars, then accidents, then medical technology - a chain of effects.
*   **D: Takniki taraqqi syaasi asaro rosukh parr mabni nahein hoti hay** (Technical progress is not based on political influences) -  This is also consistent with the passage's definition of technical determinism; the theory posits technology's progress is independent of political pressures.

**Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer because it directly opposes a fundamental claim of the theory of technical determinism as described in the passage.**"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon kamaan khinchney sey wabastah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek ziyadah narm aawaz (A very soft sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage states:

* **Up bow (balayi kamaan)** generally produces a *softer* sound.
* **Down bow (zereen kamaan)** generally produces a *stronger* sound.

The question asks what isn't *directly related to how you draw the bow* (i.e., the physical action of drawing the bow). While the sound *results* from the bow draw, the sound itself isn't a *method* of drawing the bow.

Let's look at why the other options are related to bow draw:

* **B: Eek nishaan jo eek staple ki tarah dikhta hay (A mark that looks like a staple):** This *is* the visual cue for a down bow, directly instructing how to draw.
* **C: Eek ziyadah mazboot aawaz (A very strong sound):**  This is a *result* of a specific type of bow draw (down bow).
* **D: Mendak parr shuru karnaa (Starting on the frog):** This directly describes the starting point for the down bow and how to hold the bow.



Therefore, a soft sound is a *consequence* of a certain bow direction, not a method of drawing it."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein kon ziyadah narm aawaz sey wabastah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Kamaan khinchnaa (Drawing the bow)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text states:** ""Balayi kamaan aam taur parr naram aawaz paida karta hay, jabkah zereen kamaan ziyadah mazboot aur purr jazm hota hay."" (The up bow generally produces a soft sound, while the down bow is stronger and more emphatic.)
* **""Balayi kamaan""** refers to the up bow (marked like a ""wee"" - essentially the 'V' shaped mark, option C).
* **""Zereen kamaan""** refers to the down bow (marked like a staple or scoop with the bottom side gone - option A).
* The text directly links the *type of bow* (up or down) to the sound produced.  It doesn't say *drawing* the bow affects the softness/strength of the sound. Drawing the bow is the *action* performed with either type of bow.
* Starting position (Option D) is related to the down bow, and therefore strength of sound.

Therefore, drawing the bow itself isn't specifically tied to a softer sound according to the passage.



"
Fossils iss baat ko dikhataa hay kehh haath bilaakhir kiss darjah zail key liye buniyaadi tor parr istemaal honey key liye mowafiqat pazeer huey they?,"The correct answer is **C: Naqlo harkat (Transport/Movement)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the fossilized hand bones (2-3 million years old) ""reveal this change in the characteristic of the hand for **a style of locomotion (naqlo harkat)**.""  The passage discusses how hands evolved to *assist* in movement, specifically by allowing early hominids to walk on all fours while still being able to use their hands for support and carrying things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Heraa pheri (Manipulation):** While hands *eventually* became good for manipulation, the passage focuses on the *initial* adaptation.
*   **B: Wazan bardaasht karnaa (Weight bearing):**  The passage mentions hands *could* bear weight while knuckle-walking, but that isn’t the primary reason for the adaptation.
*   **D: Ungliyaan key bal chalnaa (Walking on fingertips):** The text doesn’t suggest adaptation for walking on fingertips.



"
Drajah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr chimpanzee key haath aur pair ki ungliyon ki wazahat kartaa hay? ,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh bojh uthaaney key liye istemaal hotey hein** (They are used for carrying loads).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*Chimpanzee key haath paaon hajm aur lambayi mein yaksaan hotay hain aur uss kee binaa parr jab woh pichlay panjay parr chalta hay to haath mein bojh uthaa sakta hay.*"" (Chimpanzee's hands and feet are equal in size and length, and when it walks on its knuckles, it can carry loads in its hands.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh insaanon sey ziyada sidhee hoti hein** (They are straighter than humans) - The passage states human hands and feet have straighter fingers and shorter bones, implying chimpanzee fingers are *less* straight.
*   **B: Unkey haath aur pair size mein muktalif hotey hein** (Their hands and feet differ in size) - The passage explicitly says they are *equal* in size.
*   **D: Wohh buniyaadi tor parr heraa pheri key liye istemaal hotey hein** (They are primarily used for manipulation) - While chimpanzees *can* manipulate objects, the passage highlights their ability to carry loads as a key feature related to their hand structure.



"
Intekhaab sey kiss pool key liye naya jiniyaati tanawwo hat jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Wazeh kardah** (Expressed/Revealed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...intekhab usay **izhaar kardah tagayyur** key pool say hazaf karti hay.""  This translates to ""...selection removes from the pool of **expressed variation**.""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chipaa hua** (Hidden) - The passage says selection *doesn't* act on hidden variation.
*   **B: Tarkibe nav** (New combination) - While new combinations of genes happen, that's not what selection directly removes.
*   **C: Alahedgi** (Difference/Deviation) -  While differences exist, selection acts on the *expressed* differences, not just the differences themselves.



"
Jiniyati tanawwo shaamil karney key liye konsa amal zimmah daar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Taghayyur (Variation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tagayyur jadeed jinyati tabdeeli shaamil karti hay..."" which translates to ""Variation includes new genetic changes..."" 
* This directly links variation to the inclusion of genetic diversity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alahedgi (Segregation):** While segregation *contributes* to variation, it's a *part* of the process, not the overall action responsible for including genetic diversity. It's the separation of alleles, but variation is the resulting differences.
* **B: Tarkibe nav (New Combination):** This refers to recombination, which also contributes to variation, but isn't the overarching process.
* **D: Wazeh kardah (Expressed):** This means ""expressed"" or ""manifested,"" referring to traits that *result* from variation, not the cause of it.



Therefore, **Taghayyur (Variation)** is the most accurate answer to the question of what is responsible for including genetic diversity."
"Ebarat mein Malumaat ki buniyaad parr, inmein sey kisko “protein key masalah” ko hal karney key liye kisi langoor ko khaana chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Tiddiyaan (Grasshoppers)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that animal food sources (like ants, termites, and eggs) are easily digestible and contain a high amount of protein *and* all necessary amino acids.  It then draws a parallel to how monkeys likely solved their ""protein problem"" in the past.  While the passage mentions leaves and stems as containing protein, it also stresses they are *difficult* to digest.

Tiddiyaan (Grasshoppers) are an animal food source, fitting the description of easily digestible, high-protein food with all necessary amino acids mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sookhi pattiyaan (Dry leaves):** The passage states these are hard to digest.
*   **B: Kachchi daalein (Raw beans):**  Like leaves, these are plant-based and hard to digest.
*   **D: Phool ki daalein (Flower petals):** The passage doesn't mention flower petals and implicitly prioritizes animal sources for protein.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, ahem amino acid ki kami ki wajah sey kon saa darjah zail masalah pesh aata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Ghezaiyyat (Malnutrition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that failure to meet amino acid needs can lead to ""**ghizaiyyat ki kami**"" (nutritional deficiency).  While digestive issues (A) and ultimately death (D) are *consequences* of this deficiency, the passage directly identifies nutritional deficiency as a key outcome.  ""Maayus kun badhotri"" (C - stunted growth) is also mentioned as a consequence, but ""ghizaiyyat ki kami"" is the more encompassing and direct answer to the question of what problems arise from a lack of essential amino acids.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is **B**.



"
Kisi makhsus zaili saqafat key araakin aksar jamaat key saath apni wabastagi matlab hotaa hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Alamat ki eek shakal key tor parr tarz ka istemaal karkey** (Using style as a form of symbol).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Zeli saqafat key arkaan aksar apni rukniyat kaa esharah *imtiyazi aur alamati tarz*, jismein fashion, khaas usloob aur boll chaal kaa istemaal kartay huay kartay hain.""  This directly translates to ""Members of a subculture often indicate their membership in a *distinctive and symbolic way*, using fashion, specific styles and speech.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Morakkab karney ki koshish karkey** (Trying to complicate things) - The passage doesn't suggest subcultures try to complicate things.
* **B: Gardo nwah key har shakhs key eteqaad ki mowafeqat karkey** (Agreeing with the beliefs of every individual) - Subcultures are about shared identity, not unanimous belief.
* **C: Samaji meyaraat ko qobool karkey** (Accepting social norms) -  Subcultures often *resist* or deviate from mainstream social norms.  The passage says they feel *ignored* by those norms.

"Ebarat mein pesh kardah nazriyah key motabiq, eek bacha key saath kiya waqea ho sakta hay jiss ki shanakht eek nasli aqalliyat key saath hoti hay jo kehh dhamki aamez rawayyah mein mashgool honey keliye eek daqyanusi tasavvur hay?","The correct answer is **B: Bachha key liye dhamki aamez rawayyah mien mashgool honey ka ziyadah imkaan hogaa (The child will be more likely to engage in threatening behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children develop awareness of stereotypes about racial and ethnic groups at a very young age, and these stereotypes *influence their behavior*. Specifically, it gives the example of a child identified as belonging to a racial minority stereotyped as not doing well in school.  Once that child becomes aware of this stereotype, they might *reject* doing well in school, essentially *fulfilling* the negative expectation.

The passage implies a self-fulfilling prophecy. If a child is aware they are associated with a stereotype of ""threatening behavior,"" they may, consciously or unconsciously, act in a way that confirms that stereotype. They might engage in threatening behavior to align with the perceived expectation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bachha dhamki aamez rawayyah mein mashgool honey sey bachney ki koshish karegaa (The child will try to avoid engaging in threatening behavior):** While a child might *want* to avoid this, the passage suggests the influence of the stereotype is strong enough to push them *towards* it.
*   **C: Bachha samaji halaat mein waapas ley legaa (The child will withdraw from social situations):** The passage doesn't suggest withdrawal; it focuses on behavioral *expression*.
*   **D: Bachha deegar nasli aqalliyaton key saath mashgool honey sey inkaar kar degaa (The child will refuse to engage with other racial minorities):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nasli daqyanusiyat key baarey mein eek bachha ki jaankari ka darjah zail mein sey kis parr asar pad sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Unka rawayyah (Their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when children learn about stereotypes associated with their race (""*jab apni nasal say waabastah daqyanosi key baaray mein jaantay hain*""), it *influences how they act* (""*school mein achhaa nahein karnaa chahte hain*"").  This directly relates to their behavior/attitude.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Jiss nasli aqalliyat key saath shanakht karney ka wohh intekhaab kartey hein (The racial minority with which they choose to identify):** The passage doesn't say they *choose* an identity; it says they *learn about* stereotypes associated with the identity they already have.
*   **C: Deegar bachhon key saath unkey talluqaat (Their relationships with other children):** While this *could* be affected, the passage specifically focuses on the child's *own* academic performance change, not their relationships.
*   **D: Unki nasal ki pahchaan (Their racial identity):** While the knowledge affects *how they view* their racial identity, the passage's focus is on the *effect* of that knowledge, which is a change in behavior.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kis key liye eek wahshi bachah ki mosalsal parwarish mumkin nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Mazboot guftagu karney ki maharatein (Strong communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""feral"" children as those denied social interaction and often subjected to neglect or abuse. It states that feral children, raised by animals, exhibit behavior resembling those animals – **fear of humans or indifference towards them**.  This implies a lack of developed social skills, *specifically* communication skills, because they haven't learned them through human interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aazadanah tor parr rahnaa (Living independently):** While feral children are independent in a survival sense, the passage doesn't say they *cannot* live independently; they simply live independently *because* they were deprived of a normal upbringing.
* **C: Alag rujhanaat (Different tendencies):**  Feral children will naturally have different tendencies due to their unique upbringing, but this isn't something they're incapable of.
* **D: Samaji bechaini (Social anxiety):** The passage *describes* social anxiety as a result of their upbringing, not as something they're incapable of experiencing.  They *have* social anxiety; it's a consequence of their isolation.



Therefore, the passage suggests that developing strong communication skills is significantly hindered for children raised in isolation as feral children."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr atfaal mein wahshi rawayyah ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **B: wahshi rawayyah samaajiyat ki kami ki wajah sey pinap sakta hay** (Feral behavior can stem from a lack of socialization).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Samaji ahmiyat ko ujagar karnay key liye istemaal honey waale sab say aam tareeqon mein say eek yeah hay keh bachon mein apni parwarish key doraan unn chand nakhushgawar waaqiaat kee nishandahi kee jaye, jis mein inhein balghan kee jaanib say nazrandaz kartay huay... muashirati kaamon mein shirkat nahein karnay di gayee."" (One of the most common ways to highlight the importance of socialization is to point to unfortunate events in children's upbringing, where they are neglected by adults... and not allowed to participate in social activities.)  This directly links feral behavior to a *lack of social interaction*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aksar wahshi rawayyah ki wajah jismaani kharaabi hoti hay** (Feral behavior is often caused by physical disabilities): While the passage mentions physical defects *can* lead to abandonment, it doesn't state it's the *cause* of feral behavior.
* **C: Wahshi rawayyah sirf unn bachhon mein ghaalib hota hay jinn key waldain unhein mahdood rakhtey hein** (Feral behavior only prevails in children whose parents confine them):  The passage mentions confinement as *one* factor, but also includes abandonment and being raised by animals, showing it's not the only cause.
* **D: Tamaam wahshi rawayyah ki wajah sakht zahni mazooriyaan hoti hein** (All feral behavior is caused by severe mental disabilities): The passage mentions mental defects as a reason for *rejection* that can lead to abandonment, but does not claim it's the sole cause of the feral state itself.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsa amal maaash parr mabni zaraat key saath motawaatir hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **A: Aisi paidawaar parr tawajjoh denaa jo kisaan key khaandan ki zaruriyaat ko puraa karta ho** (Focusing on producing enough to meet the farmer's family's needs).

**Here's why:**

The passage explicitly defines *maashi zaraat* (subsistence farming) as farming done ""mahaz kaasht kaar aur uss key ahal khaanah kee zaruriyat ko pooraa karnay key liye"" (solely to provide food to the extent of the farmer and their family's needs). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Deegar logon ko bechney key liye khaana tayyaar karnaa** (Preparing food to sell to others) - This describes commercial farming, not subsistence farming.
* **C: Taraqqi yaaftah taknikon key barkhilaaf aala paidawaar parr twajjoh denaa** (Focusing on high yield against advanced techniques) - Subsistence farming is described as simpler and often using traditional methods, *not* prioritizing the highest possible yield through advanced technology.
* **D: Kisaan key elaagah key liye maqaami beejon ka istemaal karna** (Using local seeds for the farmer's area) - While the passage mentions using locally adapted seeds, it's a *method* used within subsistence farming, not the defining characteristic of it.  The *purpose* is to feed the family, not simply use local seeds.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr maashi zaraat key amal ki wazahat karta hey?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuch mamalik mein abb bhi kisaan iska istemaal kartey hein (Some farmers still use it in some countries)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tarikhi tor parr ziyadah tar kisaan rozi roty key liye zaraat mein masruf hotay aur abb bhee bahut say taraqqi pazeer mulkon mein yahee hall hay"" - This translates to ""Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for their livelihood, and this is still the case in many developing countries."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeah puri tarah naamiyaati system hay (This is a completely organic system):** While the passage mentions *often* organic, it doesn't say it's *completely* organic. It uses locally preserved seeds which can be organic, but it also mentions simple combinations of crops.
* **B: Ismein faslein badhaney key liye munfarid taknikon ka istemaal hota hay (It uses unique techniques to increase yields):**  The passage describes it as aiming for *maximum* yield through *simple* methods like crop rotation, not necessarily ""unique techniques.""
* **C: Iss sey mahereene zaraat ko apney purey khittey mein apni faslein bantney ki ijazat milti hay (It allows agricultural experts to distribute their crops throughout the region):** The passage focuses on self-sufficiency for the farmer and their family, not large-scale distribution by experts.



"
Kisi museum ka daurah karnaa seyahat key kis zumrah mein aaata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Saqafati seyaahat (Cultural travel)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agar kisee khaas jagah key safar kaa maqsad uss kee tareekh aur saqafat ko jaanna hay to iss tarah key safar ko saqafati seyahat kahaa jaataa hay."" (If the purpose of traveling to a specific place is to learn about its history and culture, then this type of travel is called cultural travel).

Visiting a museum is directly related to learning about history and culture, therefore it falls under *saqafati seyaahat*.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karobaari seyaahat (Business travel):** This is travel for work-related purposes.
*   **B: Tafreehi seyaahat (Recreational travel):** While museums *can* be enjoyable, the key defining characteristic of this travel is relaxation and escape from daily life, which isn't the primary goal of a museum visit.
*   **D: Baahari seyaahat (Outdoor travel):** This involves activities in nature, like going to the beach or camping.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tafreehi mosaafiron key liye kiya cheez tarjeeh ban sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Apney rozaanah key maamul sey waqfah lenaa (Taking a break from one's daily routine)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that recreational travel happens ""when people go to completely different places from their daily routine to find peace and enjoyment."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Maqaami saqafat mein khud ko dibo denaa (Immersing oneself in local culture):** While cultural travel is *mentioned* in the passage, it's presented as a *specific type* of travel, not what most recreational travelers prioritize.
*   **C: Aham maqamaat dekhna (Seeing important landmarks):** The passage mentions popular destinations like beaches and theme parks, but doesn't frame *seeing landmarks* as the core of recreational travel.
*   **D: Kisi jagah ki tareekh ko samajhna (Understanding the history of a place):**  Like option A, this is specifically related to *cultural travel* and not recreational travel in general.



"
Ebarat mein kisi aisi cheez key tor parr kiya mazkoor hay jiss sey maqami church key andar ki tadili ko kam karney mein madad mili thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Karobaari rawayyah ki kamiyaab misaalon ko yaad karnaa** (Remembering examples of successful past approaches).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Iss misal mein, guzashta muhim karanah ravayye aur nateejatan milnay waali kamiyabi kee misalon ko yaad karnaa logon ko maqami church kee nayi tabdiliyon aur nayi samton kee jaanib mabzool karnay mein madadgaar saabit huwa."" 

This translates to: ""In this example, remembering past successful approaches and the resulting successes helped people accept the local church's new changes and new directions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While gaining insight into people who influenced the organization's culture is valuable, the passage doesn't directly link it to *reducing* resistance to change.
*   **C:** Understanding the organization's driving forces is important, but again, the passage doesn't say this specifically helped with accepting changes.
*   **D:** Understanding the organization's history is a general benefit, but the passage pinpoints *successful past approaches* as the key factor in this instance.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Kisi shakhs ki apni tareekh ki samajh haasil karney sey kiss cheez key saath madad ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Tanzeem key andar key maqaam ki samajh haasil karnaa (Understanding one's position within the organization)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Iss say bah caif logon ko uss kaa shouoor haasil karnay mein madad milti hay keh tanzeem kee tareekh mein inn kaa maqaam kiya hay"" (This helps people understand their place in the history of the organization).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Tabdili key khauf ko kam karnaa (Reducing the fear of change):** While the passage *mentions* that successful stories can reduce fear of change, it’s a consequence *of* understanding history, not the primary benefit of understanding one's history itself.
*   **B: Aqdaar ko taqwiyat denaa (Strengthening values):** The passage states understanding history helps *identify* the organization's values, but doesn't say it directly strengthens them.
*   **D: Karobaari rawayyah ko behtar bananaa (Improving business attitude):** The passage focuses on an organizational/church context, not specifically business.



Therefore, option C is the most direct and accurate answer based on the text."
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr taleem tak Maa baad jadidiyat pahunch ki wazahat kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Taleem ki tawajjoh unn cheezon parr honi chahiye jinn parr hamarah yaqeen hay kehh hamein tajarbah haasil hogaa** (Education should focus on things where we believe we will gain experience).

Here's why:

* **The passage critiques traditional education** for presenting information that learners are unlikely to *actually use* or experience. It highlights the disconnect between passively receiving knowledge (like watching a TV show about home repair) and actively applying it.
* **Postmodern learning theory, as presented here, values experience.** The author argues that learning happens in the *doing* and the *experiencing* – between the learner and the knowledge.
* **Option B directly reflects this idea.**  It suggests education should prioritize things we'll get practical experience with, aligning with the author's disdain for purely theoretical or observational learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuch taleemi tajarbaat deegar ki banisbat ziyaadah fayedah mand hotey hein (Some educational experiences are more beneficial than others):** While potentially true, this doesn't address the core argument of the passage - the *lack* of relevance and experiential learning in much of education.
* **C: Taleem key makhsus tariqey deegar sey behtar hein (Specific educational methods are better than others):** The passage actually *rejects* the idea of ""better"" methods overall, claiming there *is* no good way to learn. It focuses on the importance of *application*, not method.
* **D: Taleem mein koyi mutlaqaat nahein hein (There is no absolute in education):** This is too broad and doesn't specifically address the passage’s central claim about the importance of experience.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor par maa baad jadidiyat taleem ki pahunch ki akkasi nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Aisa ilm jiska shayad hamm kabhi bhi itlaaq na karein wohh abb bhi sikhney key qaabil hay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly *rejects* the idea that learning is valuable if it's not applied to real-life experiences. It argues that learning happens *within* the experience and that passively receiving information (like watching TV shows about things you'll never do) is not true learning.  The passage states ""seekhnay key liye koyee achhi cheez nahein hay"" (there is no good thing for learning) if it's not directly experienced.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect the post-modern view of education presented in the passage:

*   **A: Malumaat haasil karney key motaddid tariqey hein (There are multiple ways to gain information):** The passage implies this by criticizing traditional, passive learning methods.
*   **B: Makhsus taleemi tajarbaat ko deegar par tarjeeh denaa chahiye (Specific learning experiences should be prioritized):** The passage champions experiential learning.
*   **C: Eek taleemi tajarbah ka inhesaar shikhney waaley aur pesh kardah ilm parr hota hay (A learning experience depends on the learner and the presented knowledge):**  This is a core tenet of the passage – learning is a dynamic interaction between the learner and the information.



Therefore, option D is the *only* one that contradicts the passage's core argument."
"Aam nind key waqt key doraan jaan boojh kar bedaar honay key baad, inmein sey kon nind ki modakhelat key amal key saath modakhelat karegaa?","The correct answer is **C: Apni shabb bedaari mein alarm band karkey bees minaton baad waapas soney jaana**

Here's why:

The passage describes a technique for **sleep fragmentation** - briefly waking up during the night and then falling back asleep. It specifically mentions using a quiet alarm to wake you *just enough* to be conscious without fully waking up, then going back to sleep. Option C directly reflects this: waking up to turn off the alarm and then going back to sleep after around 20 minutes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waapas soney jaaney sey pahley deidh ghantaa padhnaa:** Reading for an hour and a half before sleep is unlikely to cause sleep fragmentation; it's more likely to delay sleep onset.
*   **B: Gusul khanah istemaal karkey sidhey waapas soney jaana:** This simply describes using the bathroom and going back to sleep – not intentional fragmentation.
*   **D: Apni shabb bedaari mein bottle sey paani piney key liye bedaar honaa:** While the passage *does* mention drinking fluids to wake up for a bathroom break, option D focuses solely on waking up to drink water, not the intentional short wake-up followed by a return to sleep for sleep fragmentation.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon nind ki modakhelat ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Bedaar honey key baad, maqsad do ghantah key andar waapas soney janaa hota hay.**

Here's why:

The passage describes a technique for **interrupted sleep** – briefly waking yourself and going back to sleep. It explicitly mentions a short disruption (10-60 minutes).  The goal isn't to return to sleep *within two hours*, but rather to go back to sleep relatively quickly after a short period of wakefulness.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions based on the passage:

*   **A: Yeah hayati ahang parr mabni ho sakta hay:** (This can be based on a biological rhythm) - The passage implicitly suggests this by mentioning using natural sleep cycles.
*   **B: Maqsad apney aap ko puri tarah bedaar na karnaa hay:** (The goal is not to fully wake yourself up) - The passage explicitly states using a ""relatively quiet alarm clock"" to avoid complete awakening.
*   **C: Yeah amal aapki aam nind key waqt key doraan waqea hota hay:** (This practice happens during your normal sleep time) - The passage directly states it happens within your ""normal sleep hours.""

"Jabb dimaagh ziyaadah kasrat key saath khawaab ko ujaagar krney ki koshish karta hay, to kiya cheez badh jaata hay?","The correct answer is **A: REM kaifiyaat ki miqdaar (The amount of REM episodes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Eek raat mein chand rems key saath yeah eek aisi kaifiyat hay..."" (With several REMs in a night, this is a state...). It also connects the tiring feeling to the brain *trying* to have vivid dreams (""...aapka dimagh harr shab aksar kitni wazahat say khwaab dekhnay kee koshish karta hay"").  More effort from the brain to have vivid dreams would logically mean more frequent or longer REM episodes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Energy ki sathein (Energy levels):** The passage describes feeling *tired*, not energized.
* **C: Baziyaabi kaifiyat ki tewaalat (Duration of the awakening state):** The passage compares it to waking up frequently, but the issue isn't the awakenings themselves, but the brain's activity *during* sleep.
* **D: REM kaifiyaat key darmiyaan ka waqt (Time between REM episodes):** The passage suggests the problem is the brain's effort *within* REM, not the gaps between them.



"
Darjah zail konsey manfi asaraat jo aksar khawaab dekhney ko ujaagar kar skatey hein ka jism parr asar hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: REM kaifiyaat key darmiyaan waqt ki ghati hui tewaalat** (Reduced duration of REM periods).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the feeling of being tired from artificially induced lucid dreaming is largely due to ""sales khwabon kaa natijah hay jo aar ayee em halaat key darmiyani waqfah ko taweel karta hay"" - meaning the result of frequent dreams that *lengthen the intervals between REM sleep*.  This disruption of the natural REM cycle is what leads to the exhaustion, comparable to waking up every 20-30 minutes to watch TV.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fee raat ghatey huey REMs** (Decreasing REMs per night):  The passage doesn't say the *number* of REMs decreases, but the *duration* of each REM period is affected.
* **C: Khawab dekhney ko ujaagar karney parr inhesaar** (Dependence on inducing lucid dreams):  While the passage discusses lucid dreaming, it's the *effect* of the interrupted sleep, not a dependence on inducing the dreams, that causes the tiredness.
* **D: Fee raat badha hua REMs** (Increasing REMs per night):  The passage indicates the opposite - the REM cycle is disrupted, implying a change in the *timing* not a simple increase in REMs.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, rewaayati teemein aur majazai teemein eek jaisi keon hein?","The correct answer is **A: Dono teamon key baarey mein tawaqqo hay kehh eek hi satah parr kar kardagi karein gee (Both teams are expected to perform at the same level).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Majazi teamein jodat key unhein meyaron kee paband hain jinn kee maruf teamein"" which translates to ""Virtual teams are bound by the same standards as traditional teams.""  This indicates that both types of teams are *expected* to perform to the same standards – they have similar performance expectations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage explicitly states virtual teams have *more* autonomy than traditional teams.
* **C:** The passage describes *functional* teams (Gair maryee team) as reporting to a boss, not both traditional and virtual teams.
* **D:**  The passage highlights that virtual teams operate across different time zones, the *opposite* of working in the same region/time.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad par, jismaani aur majaazi teamon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Rewayati teamein aam tor parr eek ziyadah aal meyaar key liye banayi jaati hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the opposite of option A.** It says virtual teams (majazi teams) often *reduce* contact for their nearby physical groups. It doesn't say traditional teams are formed *for* more standardisation.  In fact, the passage implies virtual teams have less direct oversight and more autonomy.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: Majazi teamein aksar rewayati teamon key rabtah key noqtah key tor parr kaam karti hein:** The passage explicitly states ""Virtual team key arkaan aksar apnay qareebi maaddi group keliye raabtah kaa kam kartay hain."" (Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their nearby physical groups.)
* **C: Rewayati teamon mein majazi teamon ki banisbat kam khud mukhtaari hoti hay:** The passage says virtual teams have *more* autonomy (""Inn mein rewayati team key arkaan kee nisbat ziyadah khud mukhtari hoti hay""). Therefore, traditional teams have less.
* **D: Mukhtalif waqt key mintaqon sey majazi teamon ko faayedah pahunch sakta hay:** The passage states ""jo inn kee maqami intezamiya nahein samajh sakti"" (which their local management cannot understand), highlighting the benefit of being able to connect across different time zones.



Therefore, option A is the statement that is *not* supported by the text."
Darjah zail mein sey kon koyi aisi cheez nahein hay jiss parr mashmool key nazriyaat markooz hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Andaruni zaruriyaat (Internal needs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that motivational theories focus on *what people want and like*. It specifically mentions these theories explore needs and desires that are *discovered as people mature*.  While internal needs are *related* to motivation, the passage emphasizes the *discovery* of these needs through maturation and the influence of external factors. The theories aren't primarily *about* the internal needs themselves, but rather *how* those needs manifest and are influenced.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Bolughat mein amali bananey waali nayi khwahishein (New desires activated during maturity):** The passage directly states theories propose needs/desires are found *as people mature*.
* **B: Kaisey kisi shakhs ka mahaul uskey aamal ko motassir karta hay (How a person's environment affects their actions):** The passage explicitly states theories discuss environmental factors influencing behavior.
* **D: Logon ki pasandidgiyaan samajhnaa (Understanding people's preferences):** The passage opens by stating theories are ""marked by what people want and like.""



Therefore, the only option *not* directly mentioned as a focus of motivational theories within the given text is the existence of internal needs themselves, but rather the emergence and influence of those needs."
Darjah zail mein sey kon teesron key qaedon ka maful nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek tasweer key andar zindagi aur taqat bananaa (To create life and power within a picture)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the ""rule of thirds"" in photography. It states the rule helps maintain balance and create visual interest by dividing an image into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. This guides the placement of key elements.

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to the rule of thirds:

*   **A: Eek buniyaadi line banana jahan key liye faayel ko rakhaa jaa sakey (Creating a basic line where the file can be placed)** - This refers to the lines themselves that divide the image.
*   **C: Faayel ko makhsus aur moassir maqaam mein rakhnaa (Placing the file in a specific and effective location)** - The rule of thirds guides *where* to place important elements for maximum impact.
*   **D: Kisi tasweer mein tarteeb qayem rakhnaa (Establishing order in a picture)** - The rule of thirds inherently creates order and structure.

Option B, creating ""life and power,"" is a desirable *outcome* of good composition, but isn't a description of the *rule itself*.  The rule of thirds is a *technique* to help *achieve* that outcome, it's not the definition of the rule.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon 35mili meter ki shakal ki wazahat nahein kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Ismein bahut si aam shaklon ki banisbat eek mukhtalif pahlu ka tanasub hay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many common formats (like APS) are *similar to or approximate* the 3:2 aspect ratio of 35mm. This means 35mm is *not* a different aspect ratio than many common formats - it's quite standard.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Yeah abb bhi tayyaari mein hay** - The passage states ""Yeah aaj bhee tayyaar kee jaati hay"" (It is still manufactured today).
*   **B: Iski mowafiqat dijital camera ki shaklon sey hoti hay** - The passage says ""Iss kaa soorti tanasub digital camera tasveeri censor farmats say aaya hay"" (Its aspect ratio comes from digital camera image sensor formats).
*   **D: Yeah duniya mein sabsey aam shakal hay** - The passage begins ""Misal key tor parr, duniya mein sab say aam jaamid image photography farmat 35 milli meter hay"" (As an example, the most common static image photography format in the world is 35 millimeters).

Therefore, option C is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jabb tayyaar karney walon ney lens key masnuah key meyaar ko badha dety hein, to zoom lenso ko behtar kaisey kiya gaya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Unka tasveeri meyaar tay shudah focal lambayi waley lenson key momasil hota hay**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iss nay zoom lenses ko aisi meyari tasavir pesh karnay key qaabil banaya hay jokeh muqarrar kardah tool maaskah lenses say haasil kee jaaney waali tasavir key muqabilay kee hon."" 

This translates to: ""This has made zoom lenses capable of presenting images of a standard comparable to those obtained from fixed focal length lenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unmein lens ki ziyaadah raftaarein hoti hein** - The passage actually states zoom lenses *typically have a lower* maximum aperture (speed).
*   **B: Kam roshni ki surate haal mein unhein istemaal karnaa ziyadah aasan hay** - The passage states it's *more difficult* to use cheap zooms in low light.
*   **D: Ibtadayi lenson ki banisbat inmein kam focal uljhan hoti hay** - The passage explains focal complexity is actually a *drawback* of zoom lenses, not something improved by manufacturing standards.



"
"Ebarat mein malumaat ki buniyaad parr, zoom lens ko ibtadayi lens parr kabb tarjeeh dee jaa sakti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Agar aap mazeed focal uljhan ki talaash kar rahey hon** (If you are looking for more focal versatility).

Here's why:

The passage states that zoom lenses excel in providing a ""range of focal lengths"" that is significantly greater than fixed (prime) lenses. This ""focal pecheedgi"" (focal versatility) is a key advantage. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar aala ziyaadah sey ziyaadah suraakh tarjeeh ho** (If a larger aperture is preferred): The passage explicitly states zoom lenses generally have *smaller* maximum apertures compared to prime lenses.
* **B: Agar aap ko kam lens key anaasir chahiyein** (If you want fewer lens elements): Zoom lenses have *more* lens elements than prime lenses.
* **C: Agar aap ziyadah tareek tartibaat mein flash na istemaal karna chahtey hon** (If you want to avoid using flash in low-light situations): The passage says zoom lenses struggle in low light due to their smaller apertures, making flash *necessary* in those conditions.

Darjah zail mein sey kisko tasavvuf ki durust wazahat nahein samjha jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Barahe raast zaati tajrabah haasil karney parr takid bahut sey deegar mazhabi aqidah aur ebaadat ki shaklon sey qaabiley moznah hay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sufism *distinguishes itself* from other religious beliefs and forms of worship by its emphasis on direct, personal experience. Saying it's *comparable* to them contradicts this core idea presented in the text.

Let's break down why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A:** The passage mentions ""pur aman, sahib idraak, shadmani yaa yahaan tak keh haalat wajd"" (peaceful, conscious, joyful, even ecstatic states) as ways Sufism is expressed, showing it emphasizes experiences of peaceful and blissful awareness.
*   **B:** The passage states Sufis seek ""roohani sachayi"" (spiritual truth) and ""khudaa say aagahi"" (awareness of God).
*   **C:** The passage says followers ""ekhteyaar kar saktey hein jiss sey elahee haqeeqat mein unki baseerat ko parwarish paaney mein madad miley gee"" (adopt practices that help nurture their insight into divine reality).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon tasavvuf ka markaze tawajjoh nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Bedaari ki khush kun kaifiyat parr takid (Emphasis on the pleasant feeling of wakefulness)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Sufiyana Khayal (Sufism) as a pursuit of:

*   Identity/Reality
*   Ultimate Truth
*   Divinity
*   Spiritual Truth
*   Knowledge of God
*   Direct experience of divine reality/deities

It also mentions practices aimed at *cultivating* these experiences and emphasizes a focus on *personal, conscious experience* – often leading to states of ecstasy (wajd).

Let's look at why the other options *are* central to Sufism according to the text:

*   **A: Elahee haqeeqat mein wajdaan haasil karna (Achieving ecstatic experience in divine reality):** The passage explicitly mentions ""halat-e-wajd"" (states of ecstasy) as a way Sufism is manifested.
*   **B: Mushatarekah, firqah waraanah tajrabaat key zariyah baseerat ka taaqub karnaa (Pursuing insight through shared, trans-communal experiences):**  The text states Sufis seek insight through direct experience (""raast tajarbah"") and even hints at experiences beyond conventional understanding.
*   **D: Khuda key baarey mein bedaar aagahi ka taaqub karnaa (Pursuing awakened awareness of God):** The passage clearly states Sufism is about gaining ""khudaa say aagahi"" (awareness of God).

**Option C,** however, focuses solely on the *pleasant feeling of being awake*.  While a heightened state of awareness is *part* of the Sufi journey, the passage doesn't portray it as the *goal* itself. Sufism is about the *content* of that awareness – the divine, the truth, the ultimate reality – not just the feeling of being conscious.  It’s about *what* you awaken to, not *that* you are awake.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zaraati samaaj kis ney shuru kiya hogaa?","The correct answer is **B: Chatham jazayer ka Moriori**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Moriori people were a group *from* the larger Māori population who migrated to the Chatham Islands (Cheetham Jazeeraan). They then developed their own unique, peaceful culture *on* the Chatham Islands.  The text doesn't suggest the Moriori *started* a society in New Zealand, but rather *evolved* from a Māori group that left New Zealand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New Zealand ka Moriori:** The text indicates they *left* New Zealand, they didn't start a society there as described in the passage.
*   **C: Polynesia key Maori log:** While the Māori originated from Polynesia, the text focuses on the development of the Moriori *after* their migration.
*   **D: Barre aazam key Maori:** ""Barre aazam key Māori"" refers to the larger Māori group that the Moriori originated *from*, not the group who established a society.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, moas kaa shikaar karney waali jamaat kis jagah key pahley bashindey they?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

The passage states: ""Onneeswein aur beeswein sadee key doraan eek taweel arse tak yeah samjha jaataa rahaa keh **New Zealand key pehle baashinde maawari log they jo maawas naami baday parinday shikaar kartay they**."" (For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was understood that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Māori people who hunted the large moa bird.)

Therefore, according to the text, the group that hunted moas were the first inhabitants of New Zealand.



"
kiss manzarnaamah mein Pureland key origami key tariqah ka istemaal karney sey tah karney waley ko fayedah hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Tah karney waala yakbaargi mutaddid tahein bananey ko tarjeeh detaa hay (The folder prefers to make multiple folds)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a very simple origami model:**  It's designed for beginners or those with limited motor skills.  It can only be folded one way at a time, and has straightforward folds.
* **This limits complexity:** Someone who *prefers* making many complex folds would be frustrated by this model.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** Advanced motor skills aren't *needed* for this origami, making it unhelpful for someone who already has them.
    * **C:** The model *specifically* avoids complex, reverse folds.
    * **D:**  The design is for learning, not for someone who's only tried it a couple of times.



Therefore, the person who would benefit most from this specific origami style is someone who prefers making many simpler folds."
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr Pureland origami ka wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Iss tariqah mein ulti tahein shaamil hein** (This method includes reverse folds).

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that Pureland origami **does not** involve complex reverse folds. It emphasizes the simplicity of the folds and that only one fold can be made at a time. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Yeah tajarbah kaar tah karney waalon key liye matlub hay** (This is intended for experienced folders) - The passage states it was made for those with limited motor skills *or* inexperienced folders, so this is true.
*   **C: Tahon mein seedhi jaghon ka hona zaruri hay** (Straight positions in the folds are necessary) - The passage confirms all folds have straight positions.
*   **D: Mahdood motor ki maharatein waley Tah karney walon key liye yeah eek achha tariqah hay** (This is a good method for those with limited motor skills) - The passage directly mentions this as a purpose of the technique.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Konsi jagah sindh waadi ki tahzeeb key saath wabastah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Shumaal mashriqi Afghanistan key tamaam khittey**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Indus Valley Civilization (Waadi Sindh ki Tehzeeb) covered:

*   Most of modern-day Pakistan
*   Parts of northwestern India
*   **Northeastern parts of Afghanistan**

However, it specifically mentions the *northeastern* regions of Afghanistan.  The option states *all* regions of northeastern Afghanistan.  While some areas were included, the passage does *not* say the entire area was encompassed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappa:** The passage explicitly mentions Harappa as a site excavated in the 1920s and associated with the civilization (referred to as the ""Hadappa ahed"" or Harappan period).
*   **B: Sarasvati nadi:** The passage discusses the debate about whether to call it the ""Sindh-Sarasvati"" civilization because of potential sites in the dried-up Sarasvati river basin.
*   **D: Bahut saa jadid daur ka Pakistan:** The passage states the civilization covered a large part of modern Pakistan.



"
Ebarat mein bahas kardah Bronze Age ki tahzeeb key liye mumkanah naam key tor parr darjah zail mein kon mazkoor nahein hay,"The correct answer is **A: Harappan tahzeeb**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **Sindh waadi ki tehzeeb** (Indus Valley Civilization) - as the primary name.
*   **Sindh-Sarasvati tehzeeb** (Indus-Sarasvati Civilization) - as a proposed alternative by some scholars.
*   **Daryaaye Sindh ki tahzeeb** (Civilization of the Indus River) - describing where the civilization flourished.
*   The passage states that some call it **Hadappa ahed ki tehzeeb** (Harappa age civilization), but explicitly mentions *after* the Harappan age.

It *doesn't* directly mention ""Harappan tehzeeb"" as one of the names currently being discussed or debated for the Bronze Age civilization in question. It frames it as a name used *after* the Harappan age (Hadappa ahed key baad).

Therefore, **Harappan tehzeeb** is the name *not* listed as being considered for the civilization in the provided text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsi paidawaar taweel muddat tak faayedah deti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Deegar logon key saath taawun karnaa (Cooperating with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ummid hay keh ziyadah tar log mahsus karein gay keh inn kaa taweel muddati behtareen ekhtiyar doosron key saath mill karr kam karnaa hay."" This translates to ""It is hoped that more people will realize that their best long-term option is to work with others.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kisi key zaati mafaad ko tarjeeh denaa (Prioritizing one's own self-interest):** The passage actually *contrasts* this with the long-term benefit, suggesting short-term gains from selfishness are ultimately less valuable.
* **C: Iss parr zor denaa kehh aksariyat parr aqalliyat kiya fayedah pahunchey gaa (Focusing on what benefit the majority gains from the minority):**  The passage doesn't focus on this dynamic. It’s about overall cooperation, not majority/minority benefits.
* **D: Yeah shanakht karnaa kehh lalach fayedah mand ho sakti hay (Recognizing that greed can be beneficial):** While the passage acknowledges greed exists, it frames cooperation as the superior long-term strategy.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko koyi shakhs tarjeeh dey sakta hay agar uski tawajjoh fauri fawaayed parr hay?","The correct answer is **D: Khud garzi (Selfishness)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jahaan aksariyat faiz yaab hoti hay wohein mukhtasar meyaad mein khud gharzi say kam karkay hameshah ziyadah fayedah uthaya jaye gaa."" This directly translates to: ""Where most succeed, in the short term, by acting selfishly, they will always gain more benefit.""

Therefore, if someone is focused on *immediate benefits*, the passage suggests they will prioritize **Khud garzi (selfishness)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Be garzi (Selflessness):** The passage contrasts selfishness with long-term benefit through cooperation.
*   **B: Ishteraak (Collaboration):**  Collaboration is presented as the *better, long-term* option, not the one for immediate gains.
*   **C: Taawun (Balance):**  While the passage mentions balance, it's in the context of contrasting short-term selfishness with long-term cooperation, not as the priority for immediate benefit.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jang key ikhrajaat key ahem hissah ka kisney ihaatah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Filipini log**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Filpine parr fateh mein ameriki samrajiyat key jangi ikhrajat khud filpino afraad nay adaa kiye they."" This directly translates to: ""In the Philippine war of conquest, the war expenses of the American empire were paid by the Filipino people themselves.""

The passage further explains *how* they paid, but the core statement is that the **Filipino people** bore the cost of the war.



"
Templars key ahed sey pahley kiss waqt ka dor aaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Shuruaati qoroone wustaa (Early Middle Ages)**.

The passage states that the events surrounding the Templars took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, which was the *height* of the Middle Ages.  It then specifies that this came *after* the *early* Middle Ages. Therefore, the period before the Templars' time was the Early Middle Ages.
"
Templars key ahed key baad kiss waqt ka dor aaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Aala qoroone wustaa** (High Middle Ages).

The passage states: ""...Ibtadayi qoroone wustaa key baad **oonchi qoroone wustaa** aur uss key baad jadeed qoroone wustaa kaa daur..."" which translates to ""...after the Early Middle Ages came the **High Middle Ages** and after that the Late Middle Ages..."". 

The question asks what period came *after* the Templars' time, which falls within the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries – placing it in the High Middle Ages."
Konsa tibbee elaaj yaa tariqah kaar iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh usey roomi slatanat key doraan doctor aur jarraah istemaal kartey they?,"The correct answer is **A: Takleef key baad waali tanao ki kharaabi ka motaddid sokun aawar dawaon key saath elaaj karnaa** (Treating post-injury trauma with long-term calming medications).

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on acute, surgical interventions and pain management directly related to wounds and procedures.** It mentions opiates from poppy seeds and scopolamine from henbane, which were used for pain relief *during* procedures or immediately after.
*   **There's no mention of long-term treatment for trauma-related distress or psychological aftereffects.** The Romans were skilled at dealing with the physical aspects of injury, but the text doesn't suggest they had methods for ongoing psychological care.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Scopolamine key liye bhaang ki beejon key nichod ka istemaal karnaa** (Using hemp seed extract for scopolamine) - The passage *specifically* states scopolamine was extracted from henbane seeds.
*   **C: Sharyaano key anbaar waaley khoon key bahao ko raasta denaa** (Opening blocked arteries to allow blood flow) - The passage mentions cutting veins and arteries to maintain blood flow.
*   **D: Behosh marizon key liye kaat peet anjaam denaa** (Performing amputations on unconscious patients) - The passage details the skill of Roman surgeons in amputations to prevent complications.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Saltanate rome key doraan tibbee maidaan mein ki gayee taraqqiyaat ki taraf mansub nahein hay?","Correct answer: **C: Taleemi haspatalon ki tashkeel**

Here's why:

The passage mentions these advancements during the Roman Sultanate:

*   **A: Tibbee daston ki tashkeel (Formation of medical corps)** - The text states Augustus began hiring doctors.
*   **B: Saltanat ki jaarehanah foji policy (Sultanate's surgical military policy)** - The text details surgical procedures used after battles, including amputations to maintain blood flow, demonstrating a focus on military medical needs.
*   **D: Saltanat ki doctron ki takarruri (Sultanate's recruitment of doctors)** - Again, the text directly mentions Augustus starting the recruitment of doctors.

However, the passage does *not* mention the establishment of teaching hospitals. While medical advancements were made, there's no indication of institutions specifically designed for medical education.

Therefore, option C is the only one *not* supported by the text."
Kiss salahiyat parr inhesaar ko dekhnaa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Basari nizaam key aazaa** (Parts of the visual system).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Beenayi, yaa dekhnay kee salahiyat kaa inhesaar **basri nizam key hiss say mutalliq aazaa yaa aankhon parr** hota hay."" (Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the organs related to the parts of the visual system or the eyes.)

The question asks what the ability to see *depends on*. The passage directly answers this with the parts of the visual system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hayatiyaat ki zaruriyaat** (Life's necessities): While vision is important for survival, the passage doesn't say the *ability* to see depends on necessities of life.
* **C: Makhsus lahar ki lambayion key liye hassasiyat** (Sensitivity to specific wave lengths): This is *a characteristic* of the visual system mentioned in the passage, but not what the *ability to see* fundamentally depends on.
* **D: Tez nigaahi key mukhtalif darjey** (Different degrees of visual acuity): Again, this is a *feature* of vision, not the foundation of it.



"
Hayatiyaat keyn darmiyaan ankh ki saakht ka tanawwo kiss cheez parr munhasir hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Hayatiyaat ki zaruriyaat (Needs of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aankhon kee bahut see mukhtalif sakhtein hain jo jaandar kee zaruriyat parr inhesaar kartay hoay pecheedgi mein mukhtalif hadein rakhti hain.""  This directly translates to: ""Eyes have many different structures which, depending on the *needs of the organism*, have varying degrees of complexity.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toole mauj ki hassasiyat (Sensitivity to wave length):** While the passage *mentions* sensitivity to wavelength, it doesn't say that the *structure* of the eye is determined by this.
* **C: Tez nigaahi ki satah (Level of acuity):**  Acuity is a result of eye structure, but not the primary driver *of* that structure.
* **D: Hayatiyaat ki pecheedgi (Complexity of life):** The complexity of life influences eye structure, but the passage specifically says the eye structure adapts to the *needs* within that complexity.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sikh mazhab key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr mazhab ki tasveer kahsi nahein karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Sikh mazhab hindu rewayat key andar firqah ki ee tafreeq ka natijah thaa (Sikh religion was a result of sectarian differences within Hindu traditions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Sikh religion *developed* from ancient Hindu beliefs *through disagreement* (ikhtelaaf) in the 15th century.** It doesn't describe it as simply a *sectarian difference* *within* Hindu traditions.  It implies a more active separation and development *because of* those disagreements. While it acknowledges Hindu foundations, it emphasizes the deliberate distancing from Hindu beliefs to form a distinct religion.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Guru sikh mazhab key liye eek buniyaadi pahlu hay (Guru is a fundamental aspect of the Sikh religion):**  The passage clearly states that the concept of the Guru is central to Sikhism, even more so than in other Indian religions.
* **C: Naw guruon mazahab key baani, Guru Nanak key baad aaye (New Gurus followed the founder, Guru Nanak):** The passage explicitly mentions that other Gurus came after Guru Nanak.
* **D: Sikh mazhab ki makhsus rewayaton ki jadd hindu mazhab mein hay (The roots of Sikhism's specific traditions are in Hinduism):** The passage says Sikhs *acknowledge* their Hindu foundations and traditions.



Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't accurately represent the information presented in the text."
Ebarat key hisaab sey darjah zail mein sey kisko Sikh aqeedah key system ka markazi pahlu samjha jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Guru ka tasavvur (The concept of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""guru kaa tasavvur tamaam hindustani mazahib kaa eek bunyadi pehlu hay lekin sikh mat mein iss kee ahmiyat eek bunyadi aqeedah kee haisiyat say hay.""  This translates to ""The concept of the Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism its importance is that of a fundamental belief.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hindu rewayatein (Hindu traditions):** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism has Hindu foundations, it doesn't identify traditions as the *central* belief.
* **C: Deegar hindustani mazhabon ko tasleem karney sey inkaar (Refusal to acknowledge other Indian religions):**  The passage doesn't mention any refusal; it highlights the importance of the Guru, a common element *among* Indian religions.
* **D: Panjabi zubaan mein bolnaa (Speaking in Punjabi):** The passage doesn't discuss language at all.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Ebarat key hisaab sey, tawajjoh ki kami ki kharaabi waley bachhon key paas kiss cheez parr tawajjoh deney mein mushkil waqt hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Schooli kaam** (School work).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Add (tauajjoh khasarah izteraab) waale bachon ko aisi cheezon say, jaise keh school key kam parr tauajjoh markooz karnaa bahut mushkil hota hay**"" which translates to ""Children with ADD (attention deficit disorder) find it very difficult to focus on things like school work.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Games khelnaa** (Playing games): The passage says children with ADD *enjoy* and can focus *on* games.
* **C: Cartoon dekhnaa** (Watching cartoons):  Similar to games, the passage states they can focus on preferred cartoons.
* **D: Jiss kaam key karney sey wohh lutf andoz hotey hein** (Things they enjoy doing): This is too broad. While true, the passage *specifically* highlights difficulty with schoolwork.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tawajjoh ki kami ki kharaabi waley bachhey aam tor parr khatrnaak rawayyon mein keon masruf rahtey hein?","The correct answer is **D: Unkey dimaagh ki hausalh afzayi karnaa (To stimulate their brains)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""chonkeh unn kaa dimagh aam tareeqon say sokoon nahein paataa"" (because their brains don't find peace in normal ways).  It then explains they engage in risky behaviors (""jhagday karnaa aur qanoon naafiz karnay waale idaaron say Ulajhna"") ""takeh unn key dimagh ko sokoon milay"" (to give their brains peace/stimulation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ziyaadah faaliyat ko kam karnaa (To reduce excessive activity):** The passage describes *hyperactivity* as a symptom, not something they're trying to reduce through risky behavior.
* **B: Saathiyon key saath judney mein unki madad karnaa (To help them connect with peers):**  The passage states relationships are *difficult* because others don't understand their behavior.
* **C: Apney waldain sey tawajjoh haasil karnaa (To get attention from their parents):** While attention-seeking *can* be a factor in some cases, the passage specifically links the risky behaviors to the brain's need for stimulation.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon scaffolding ki misaal nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Eek aazad taleemi program (An independent learning program)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines scaffolding as temporary support to help someone learn something new – a ""step ahead"" facilitation. It explicitly mentions examples like a teacher or the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office (built-in help).  The key is the *temporary, guiding* aspect.

Let's look at each option:

*   **A: Computer game key shuru mein eek tutorial (A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game):** Tutorials guide you through the initial stages, providing help until you understand the mechanics – this *is* scaffolding.
*   **B: Eek SAT tutor (An SAT tutor):** A tutor provides personalized guidance and support, helping you improve specific skills – this *is* scaffolding.
*   **C: Eek aazad taleemi program (An independent learning program):** An independent program *provides* resources but doesn’t actively *guide* or support you in the moment. You're left to figure things out on your own, with no built-in assistance. This is learning, but not scaffolding.
*   **D: Eek chotey league ka coach (A little league coach):** A coach offers instruction, feedback, and encouragement, helping players develop their skills - this *is* scaffolding.

Therefore, an independent learning program doesn't offer the temporary, guiding support characteristic of scaffolding.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr scaffolding key tasavvur ki wazaht nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yeah tariqaye taleem ki banisbat taawun ziyaada hay (This method is more about support than education).**

Here's why:

* **Scaffolding** is *specifically* a method *within* education, not something *instead of* education. It's about providing support *to facilitate* learning, not simply offering support in a general sense. The passage clearly explains scaffolding *enhances* learning, making it easier and more engaging.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct descriptions of scaffolding based on the text:

* **A: Scaffolds majazi tor parr baahr ho sakta hay (Scaffolds can be figurative/abstract):** The text states scaffolds can be virtual (like the Microsoft Office paperclip) or real (like a teacher), indicating they don't have to be physical.
* **C: Yeah neez project parr mabni taleem key tor parr jaana jata hay (This is known as project-based learning):** The first sentence of the passage explicitly links scaffolding to making project-based learning easier and more interesting.
* **D: Scaffolds ka istemaal taleemi tajarbah key aaghaz mein himayat ki peshkash karney key liye hota hay (Scaffolds are used to offer support at the beginning of a learning experience):** The passage says scaffolds are designed to help students overcome challenges they might face *while* learning something new, implying support during the initial stages.



Therefore, option B misrepresents the nature of scaffolding and is the correct answer."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, MySpace ki kon si khosusiyat unn talabah ko faayedah pahuncha sakti hay jinhein padhney mein dushwari hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Takhsees (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iss ko padhnay mein aasaan bananay aur hasbe khwohish rang ko kam wo besh karnay key liye isay costomize kiya jaa sakta hay.""  This translates to ""It can be customized to make it easier to read and to increase or decrease the color to your liking.""  

This directly addresses students who have difficulty reading by allowing them to adjust the visual presentation of the site.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Blogz (Blogs):** While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn't mention how they specifically help students with reading difficulties.
* **C: Eek web patah (One web address):**  A simple web address is convenient for everyone, but doesn't directly address reading challenges.
* **D: 54 million profilein (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is irrelevant to reading ability.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon mazdoor key fasaadat parr Krushchev key jawaab ka hissah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Tankhawaah ki katautiyon ko badhanaa (Increasing wage cuts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the workers protested *against* wage cuts (ujrat kee takhfif key khelaaf). Krushchev responded by conceding *some* economic demands (kuch maashi mutalibat ko raah di), meaning he moved *away* from wage cuts, not towards increasing them.  

The passage explicitly mentions the other options as part of Krushchev's response:

*   **A: Naye wazire aazam ka taqarrur karnaa (Appointing a new prime minister)** - Gomulka was appointed.
*   **B: Order bahaal karney key liye tankon ka istemaal karnaa (Using tanks to restore order)** - Krushchev sent tanks.
*   **D: Kuch eqtesaadi motalibon ko tasleem karnaa (Conceding some economic demands)** - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Poland mein fasaadat ki wajah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka ki taqarruri (The appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the riots *led to* Gomulka being appointed Prime Minister, as a concession. He wasn't the *cause* of the riots. The riots were caused by:

* **A: Communism:** The passage says the riots ""later turned into a general protest against communism.""
* **B: Khaaney ki kamiyaan (Food shortages):**  The passage explicitly mentions ""ghazayi qillat"" (food shortages).
* **C: Tankhawaah ki karautiyaan (Wage cuts):** The passage explicitly mentions ""ujrat kee takhfif"" (wage cuts).

Therefore, Gomulka's appointment was a *result* of the unrest, not a cause.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiska USSR aur USA key darmiyaan talluqaat parr asar nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Saqafati ikhtelaafat (Cultural differences)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the clash of *nizam* (systems), *amal* (actions/practices), and *saqafat* (culture) led to the devastation of countries after WWII. However, it focuses on how Germany as a common enemy *created a path for cooperation* between the US and Russia, and then how the clash of systems and actions ultimately led to the Cold War.  

The text doesn't mention cultural differences being a *direct* driver of the US-USSR relationship or the Cold War itself. It presents them as one element of the overall post-war chaos.  The other options – differing views on Germany, conflicting actions, and disagreements over systems – are all explicitly mentioned as factors.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jarmani key baarey mein nazriyaat (Views on Germany):** The text says Germany being a common enemy *created a path* for cooperation.
*   **C: Motazaad amal kaariyaan (Conflicting actions):** The ""tasadum-e-amal"" (clash of actions) is directly linked to the post-war devastation and the rise of the Cold War.
*   **D: Nizamon key baarey mein tanazuaat (Disputes over systems):** The ""tasadum-e-nizam"" (clash of systems) is also directly linked to the post-war issues and the Cold War.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr aasab key tasalsul ko purey jism mein bhejney key maqsad ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Khoon key bahao ko aahistah karnaa (To slow down the blood flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the nervous system *maintains* blood flow while sending signals throughout the body.  It doesn't mention *slowing down* blood flow as a purpose of nerve impulses. In fact, maintaining adequate blood flow is *part* of what the nervous system does to support life.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Khoon key bahao ka bando bast karnaa (To stop blood flow)** – While not directly stated, controlling blood flow is related to maintaining bodily functions.  Sudden stops in blood flow are harmful, but the nervous system regulates it.
* **C: Hayatiyaat ko barqaraar rakhnaa (To maintain life)** - The passage explicitly states the nervous system ""barqarar rakhta hayatiyat"" (maintains life).
* **D: Mumkanah jismaani khatraat sey bachnaa (To protect against possible physical threats)** - The passage says nerve impulses are sent quickly to ""bachanay mein madadgaar saabit hoti hain"" (help protect the body).



"
Giza Plateau mein kiya mil sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Azeem ahraam**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Misar key waadi amwaat mein waaqa jezah plato, yaa """"jezah necropolis"""" mein mutaddid ahraam (jinn mein ahraam azeem sab say badaa hay), mutaddid chhote maqbaray, mutaddid muabid aur abu alhol shaamil hay.""  This translates to: ""Located in the Valley of the Tombs in Egypt, the Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"", includes multiple pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), multiple tombs, multiple temples, and the Sphinx.""

While the plateau *also* contains tombs and temples, the passage highlights the **Great Pyramid** as a key component found there. Option C is incorrect because the passage doesn't state all seven wonders are there, only the Great Pyramid which *was* one of the seven wonders.



"
Azeem ahraam ka maqsad kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Friron ki izzat afzayi karnaa** (To honor the Pharaohs).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Azeem ahraam ko firaun khufu kee takreem mein tameer kiya gayaa..."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...) and ""...murdah firaun key ehteram mein tameer kee gayein."" (were built in honor of the deceased Pharaohs).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duniyaa key saat ajayeb mein sey eek bananaa** (To become one of the seven wonders of the world) - While it *became* one of the wonders, that wasn't its original *purpose*.
*   **C: Ahem maqaam key tor parr khidmat denaa** (To serve as an important place) - The passage doesn't mention it serving a functional purpose beyond honoring the Pharaohs.
*   **D: Guzrey huey logon ki qabron ko bahaal karnaa** (To restore the tombs of past people) - It was built *as* a tomb, not to restore existing ones.



"
Mandir ko tabaah karney waley aatish zan key baarey mein hamaari jankari ka kon zimmah daar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Yunani muarrikh austribo nay baad mein uskaa naam darj kiya, jiski wajah say ham aaj usay jaantay hain"" which translates to ""Greek historian Strabo later recorded his name, which is why we know him today.""  This means Strabo is the source of our information about the arsonist (Herostratus).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ephesians:** The Ephesians were the inhabitants of Ephesus, where the temple was located. They *tried* to erase Herostratus's name, but didn't provide the information about him.
*   **B: Sikandare aazam (Alexander the Great):** Alexander offered to rebuild the temple, but wasn't the source of information about the arson.
*   **D: Artemis:** Artemis was the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not a historian or source of information about the event.



"
Artemis key mandir ki tameer nav key baarey mein konsa durust bayaniyah hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Iski tameere nav sikandare aazam key ahed key baad hui thee** (Its reconstruction happened after the era of Sikandar Azam).

Here's why:

* The passage states the temple was destroyed in 356 BC (before Sikandar Azam's reign) and rebuilt in 323 BC (after Sikandar Azam's death). 
* Sikandar Azam *offered* to rebuild it, but his offer was *rejected*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tameere nav ki adaayegi Sikandare aazam ney ki thee** (The offer for reconstruction was made by Sikandar Azam) - While true he *offered*, he didn't actually do the rebuilding.
* **C: Herostratus ko tameere nav ki qimaton ko pura karney ka hukum diya gayaa thaa** (Herostratus was ordered to pay the costs of the reconstruction) - The passage doesn't mention anything about Herostratus being involved in rebuilding. The inhabitants wanted his name erased, not to involve him further.
* **D: Iski tameere nav 320 qabl maseeh mein hui thee** (Its reconstruction happened in 320 BC) - The passage specifically states it was rebuilt in 323 BC.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sabsey pahley kabb hua thaa kehh parjatiyaan do pairon par chali theen?","The correct answer is **A: Saat million saalon pahley (Seven million years ago)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*celanthropus shayed saat million saal pehle hee donon qadmon parr chall padaa thaa*."" ( ...*celanthropus perhaps started walking on two feet even seven million years ago*). This indicates *celanthropus* was the earliest species mentioned to walk on two legs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Do million saalon pahley (Two million years ago):** This is when *homoviracts* (early humans) began walking upright, but not the *very first* time any species did.
*   **C: 3.9 million saalon pahley (3.9 million years ago):** This is when evidence of two-footed walking was found for *australopatics*, but again, later than *celanthropus*.
*   **D: 4.2 million saalon pahley (4.2 million years ago):**  Also related to *australopatics* and later than *celanthropus*.



"
Inmein sey konsi parjaatiyaan baqaedah do pairon parr chalti theen?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""insaanon nay homoviracts (yani seedha khadaa aadmi) kee namoodar honey key saath hee do million saal pehle seedha paidal chalna shuroo kardiya."" This directly links *Homo erectus* (which translates to ""upright man"") to walking on two legs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sahelanthropus:** The passage says *Sahelanthropus* ""shayed saat million saal pehle hee donon qadmon parr chall padaa thaa"" (may have walked on two legs seven million years ago) - implying it's not *definitely* established as a regular biped.
* **C: Do paya ki takhseesaat (Bipedalism):** This refers to the *trait* of walking on two legs, not a specific species.
* **D: Australopithecus:** The passage states they ""aadatan seedha nahein chalte they"" (usually didn't walk upright) and evidence of bipedalism is found in their fossils, but it doesn't mean they *regularly* walked on two legs like *Homo erectus*.



"
Jarmani ka bahriyah WWII key doraan kis cheez ko mokammal karney ki koshish kar raha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Bartaniyaah ko log aur saaman wosul karney sey rok raha thaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy (bahriyah) was trying to ""roknay uss traffic ko"" (stop that traffic) – which was the flow of people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain (Ameriki Bartaniyah).  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bartaniyah sey aaney waaley saamano ko rok rahaa thaa** - The text says they were stopping goods *going to* Britain, not coming from it.
* **C: Atlantic mein mawaad ka naqlo hamal kar raha thaa** - They weren't transporting materials; they were trying to *prevent* their transport.
* **D: Amerika ko log aur saaman wosul karney sey rok raha thaa** - While hindering supplies from America to Britain was a consequence, the primary goal was to stop Britain from receiving aid.



"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Shumaali Atlantic muhim key doraan bahri jang mein sabsey ziyadah kamiyabi kis key paas thee?","The correct answer is **B: Jarmani key log** (Germans).

Here's why:

The text states that German navy (using U-boats) was *trying to stop* the Allied efforts to send supplies and personnel across the Atlantic. While the text doesn't explicitly state who *won* the battle, it highlights the severe threat the German U-boats posed.  The text implies that if the Germans had succeeded, Britain would have fallen. This indicates that Germany was the more successful force *in the naval battle itself* – they were actively disrupting Allied shipping.  

The text emphasizes the importance of the Allies *not failing*, implying the Germans were close to succeeding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bartanavi aur Ameriki (British and Americans):** The text shows they were *under threat* and trying to maintain transport, not necessarily succeeding brilliantly in the naval battle itself.
*   **C: Jarmani aur bartanavi (Germans and British):**  While both sides were involved, the text emphasizes the German attempt to *block* the British/American efforts.
*   **D: Bartanavi (British):**  The text frames the Germans as the active disrupters, not the British as being significantly successful in combat.



"
Jabb ashuriyon ney Ghodwaar foj key istemaal ka nifaaz kiya thaa to kiya cheez mojud nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Zeenein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""zeen abhi tak eejaad nahein hoyee thee iss liye aashuri ghod sawaar ghodon kee nangay kamar parr baith key ladtay they"" which translates to ""Saddles had not yet been invented, so Assyrian cavalry fought sitting on the bare backs of horses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kamaanein (Bows):** The passage states they used bows and arrows (""jaan leva aadee kamaan say teer nikal karr"").
* **C: Rath (Chariots):** The passage mentions chariots being made lighter and faster *because* of cavalry development.
* **D: Zirah baktar (Armor):**  While not explicitly mentioned, the context of warfare implies armor would have been used, and its absence isn't the key point of the passage.



"
Ghodswari istemaal karney waali ladaiyaan kaisey ladi jaati hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Ghodon ki pusht parr** (On the backs of horses).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ghod sawaar fauj eek aisi fauj hay jo ghodon parr baith key ladti hay."" (A cavalry army is an army that fights while sitting on horses.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pairon parr** (On foot) - The passage describes *mounted* combat, not fighting on foot.
* **B: Zirah baktar key begair** (Without armor) - While the passage doesn't specifically say they had armor, it doesn't say they *didn't* have it either.  The defining characteristic is *how* they fought, not *what* they wore.
* **D: Kam fojiyon key saath** (With few soldiers) - The passage doesn't mention the size of the armies.

The text explicitly states: ""Harr mandir key andar eek khulaa ahatah hota hay aur uss key andar eek haram hota hay jis mein faqat parohit daakhil ho sakta hay."" (Every temple had an open courtyard and inside it a sanctuary where only the priest could enter.)

This means that ordinary people (like the ""awam"" or common people) were *not* allowed into the inner sanctuary (""haram"") to bring sacrifices.  They offered sacrifices in the open courtyard (""ahatah"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kisi mandir key sahan mein qurbaniyaan lekar aana** - The text says people *did* bring sacrifices to the courtyard.
* **B: Eek ibtadai mandir ki taqreeb mein shirkat karnaa** - The text describes early temples and rituals, implying participation was possible.
* **C: Mandir key sahan key meley mein** - The open courtyard was a place of activity and likely where festivals and gatherings occurred.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon khaas tor parr pujariyon key liye they?,"The correct answer is **B: Andruni pnaah gaahein** (Inner Sanctuaries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harr mandir key andar eek khulaa ahatah hota hay aur uss key andar eek haram hota hay jis mein faqat parohit daakhil ho sakta hay."" (Every temple had an open courtyard and inside it a sanctuary where only the priest could enter).  This directly indicates that the *haram* (inner sanctuary) was specifically for the priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tehwaar (Festivals)** - Festivals were occasions when priests *presented* needs to the gods, but the festivals themselves weren't *for* the priests exclusively.
*   **C: Taqribaat (Rituals)** - Rituals were performed *by* priests, but weren't a space limited to them.
*   **D: Ziggurat** - Ziggurats were towers built as part of temples, and the highest part was sacred *to* the god, not exclusively for priests.



"
Badshah Tutankhamun ko kabb badnami mili thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Unkey maqbarah ki daryaaft key baad** (After the discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tahum 1922 mein uss key maqbarah key ikteshaf key baad woh mashhur shakhsiyat ho gayaa."" (However, after the discovery of his tomb in 1922, he became a famous personality.)

This directly indicates that Tutankhamun gained fame *after* his tomb was discovered, not before or during his reign.  The passage also notes he wasn't considered important in ancient times.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unkey maqbarey mein dakah zani key baad** (After looting in his tomb) - The passage explicitly says his tomb was *protected* from looting.
* **B: Unkey ahed key doraan** (During his reign) - The passage says he wasn't considered important *during* ancient times.
* **D: Qadeem badshahon ki fihrist mein mazkoor honey key baad** (After being mentioned in the list of ancient kings) -  He wasn't listed among ancient kings, so this is incorrect.



"
Badshah Tutankhamun ko kis cheez ney misr ka mashhoor badshaah banaa diya?,"The correct answer is **A: Unkey bezarar maqbarey ki daryaaft** (The discovery of their intact tomb).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tahamm 1922 mein uss key maqbarah key ikteshaf key baad woh mashhur shakhsiyat ho gayaa."" (However, he became a famous personality after the discovery of his tomb in 1922).  It also highlights the tomb was untouched by looting, making its discovery particularly significant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qadeem badshaon ki fihrist parr unka darjah** (Their rank on the list of ancient kings) - The passage says he *wasn't* highly regarded or often listed among ancient kings initially.
* **C: Unkey maqbarey sey hazaaron namunon ki dakaiti** (The looting of thousands of artifacts from their tomb) - The passage specifically states the tomb was *protected from looting*.
* **D: Qadeem misr key auqaat key doraan unki ahmiyyat** (Their importance during the times of ancient Egypt) - The passage states he wasn't considered very important *during* his time.



"
Unani shayer Homer kiya karney key qaabil nahein thaa?,"The passage states Homer was a legendary blind poet who composed the epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey. This directly implies he was unable to *see*.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Dekhney (Seeing)**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sunaney (Hearing):** A poet needs to hear to create poetry.
*   **C: Chalney (Walking):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about Homer's ability to walk.
*   **D: Baat karney (Speaking):** A poet needs to speak or dictate their work."
Kon mashhoor unani adab key alawah kisi aur cheez key liye mashhoor thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Pythagorus was a famous Greek mathematician known for his theorem about the relationship of sides in right triangles. This is *besides* being part of Greek culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sophocles** - The passage states he's a popular playwright, solely relating to literature.
*   **B: Homer** - The passage mentions Homer is famous for his literary works (Iliad and Odyssey).
*   **D: Aristophanes** -  Like Sophocles, he's known only as a playwright.



"
Hebrew khandaan ney apnaa ziyadah waqt kahaan guzaara thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Khuli fazaa mein (In the open air)**.

The passage states: ""Ziyadah tar nasrani family khulee hawa meen rahaa karti thee."" (Most Christian families lived in the open air).  While the passage doesn't *specifically* mention Hebrew families, the context implies that similar living arrangements were common in the region, especially given the lack of affordable wood for building enclosed structures. Therefore, living in the open air is the most logical answer."
Hebrew khandaan key liye kiya cheez ziyadah ahem nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Unkey ghar** (Their homes).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mashriqe wustaa key garam maahaul mein ghar itnay ahem nahein they"" which translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, homes were not so important."" This directly answers the question about what was not important for families in the region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unki aabo hawaa** (Their weather) - While the weather is mentioned as *why* homes weren't as important, it wasn't what was considered unimportant *to the families*.
*   **B: Unkey store** (Their stores) - The passage describes the stores, but doesn't say they were unimportant.
*   **D: Unka pakwaan** (Their food) - The passage mentions cooking, but doesn't say food itself was unimportant.



"
Scandinavian mamalik key darmiyaan ekhtelaaf key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kiski wazahat nahein hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Zameen (Land)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while each country considers its place ""Scandy Neween"" (Scandinavian), differences exist in **history (tawarikh), customs (rewaaj), people (log), and officials/beliefs (hukkaam, aaraaf)**.  There is *no* mention of disagreements over the *land itself* within Scandinavia. The passage focuses on cultural and historical differences, not territorial disputes.

Therefore, the passage doesn't explain a difference in degree regarding **land** among Scandinavian countries.



"
Greenland mein sabsey pahley kon moqim huey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo qabail (Eskimo tribes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...katta nazar uss waqat schemo qabail pehle hee say vahan abad they"" which translates to ""...despite its discovery, at that time the Inuit tribes were already settled there.""  ""Schemo"" refers to the Inuit people (often called Eskimo historically).

While Erik the Red is mentioned as a later arrival, the passage clearly indicates that people were already living in Greenland before his arrival and the Norse sagas. Norwegians and Swedes came much later.



"
Konsi jamaat kusiyon key begair khaney ko tarjeeh deti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Gareeb romi khawateen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jahaan garib afraad aur khwateen apna khaana kursiyon parr baith karr khaatay they..."" which translates to ""where poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs..."". This directly indicates that poor women preferred eating *with* chairs, implying they didn't have the luxury of reclining while eating like the wealthy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maldaar romi aurat khawateen** - The passage states wealthy people (umaraa) preferred reclining, not sitting on chairs.
*   **B: Gareeb romi mard** - While poor men also ate on chairs, the passage specifically mentions women *along with* the poor.
*   **C: Maldaar romi mard** - Wealthy men preferred reclining.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon qadeem romi dawat ka hissah nahein hoga?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhuna hua turkii khana ki eek thaali**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans did *not* have turkey. It lists foods they *did* have (wild boar, peacock, etc.) and then specifically mentions foods they *didn't* have, and turkey (feel murgh) is among them.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible based on the text:

*   **A: Kursiyon par khaney waley gareeb mehmaan:** The passage states ""jahaan garib afraad... apna khaana kursiyon parr baith karr khaatay they"" (where poor people... ate their food sitting on chairs).
*   **B: Ghongon key bhukey:** While not explicitly stated, shellfish like snails were common in Roman cuisine.
*   **C: Raat key khaney key doraan letey huey maldaar mard:** The passage describes how ""umaraa ko mill kar aisi ziyafat kaa ehtemam pasand thaa jahaan woh khaana khaatay hoay karwat key bal leyt payein"" (nobles preferred banquets where they could recline while eating).



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiskey jaari asar rahney ka imkaan nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek choti saqafat (A small culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chhoti saqafatein aksar wo beshtar munasib tarikhi shahadat chhoday baghair naaped hojati hain aur mokammal tehzeeb key tor parr tasleem kiye jaaney mein nakaam rehti hain.""  This translates to: ""Small cultures often pass without leaving much significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a complete civilization.""

This directly implies that small cultures are *less likely* to have a lasting impact.

Let's look at why the other options are likely to have a lasting impact, according to the text:

*   **A: Eek samaaj (A society):** The entire passage discusses how *tehzeeb* (civilization) is adopted by a specific group within a society and how it defines a society.
*   **C: Eek shahar ki halat (The condition of a city):** The text traces the root of the word ""civilization"" back to Latin words relating to cities and city-states, indicating their importance.
*   **D: Eek tahzeebi saqafat (A civilized culture):** The passage defines a civilized culture as something that transmits knowledge and art across generations and establishes a cultural identity, implying a lasting impact.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mulk sey aagey badh kar kiya hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek tahzeebi saqafat (A civilized culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shahar- riyasatein mulk kee khabar rasaan hoti hain"" which translates to ""City-states are messengers of the country.""  And then it continues to explain that a civilized culture (tahzeebi saqafat) goes *beyond* simply being a country (mulk) – it involves transmitting knowledge and art across generations and establishing cultural landmarks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eek wahid saqafat (A unified culture):** While the passage mentions a unified culture as a starting point, it doesn't say it goes beyond a country.
*   **C: Eek shahar ki halat (The state of a city):** The passage states city-states *report* to the country, not that they go beyond it.
*   **D: Eek choti saqafatein (Small cultures):** The passage specifically says small cultures often fail to be recognized as full civilizations.



"
Drukgyal Dzong key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isko tibbat ki mongol fojon ki jeet ka jashan mananey key liye tameer kiya gaya thaa** (It was built to celebrate the victory of Tibetan Mongol armies).

Here's why:

The passage states: **""Aisa kahaa jaataa hay keh 1649 mein, zabdarang nigawang namgil nay tibbati mangol afwaj key khelaaf apni fateh kee yaadgaar key tor parr faseel kee tameer karwayi thee-""** (It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel had the fortress built as a memorial to his victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol armies).

Therefore, it was built to commemorate a victory *over* the Tibetan-Mongol armies, not to celebrate their victory.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

*   **B: Yeah Bhutan mein waqea hay** (It is located in Bhutan) - The passage implies this as it calls it a significant place in Bhutan.
*   **C: Eek aag ney qilah ki bahut si baqiyaat ko tabaah kar diya thaa** (A fire destroyed much of the fortress remains) - The passage clearly states, **""1951 mein aag lagnay say drikgiyal dzong key mahaz chand nawadir hee baaqi rahay""** (A fire in 1951 left only a few rarities of Drukgyal Dzong remaining).
*   **D: Isko Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ney banaya thaa** (It was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - The passage explicitly states he commissioned its building.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Drukgyal Dzong mein aag key natijah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Akeli bachi hui baqiyat Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal ki tasweer thee** (The only remaining remnants were the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""1951 mein aag lagnay say drikgiyal dzong key mahaz chand nawadir hee baaqi rahay, maslaan zabdring nigawang kee shabiah."" This translates to ""After the fire in 1951, only a few rarities remained of Drikgyal Dzong, such as the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibbat ki mongol fojein faateh theen** (Tibetan Mongol armies were victorious) - The text states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal won *against* them.
* **C: Kashish ki shohrat motassir nahein hui thee** (The attraction/fame was not affected) -  While the text says it became a ""sensational place,"" it's *because* of the fire and ruins, not in spite of them. The fire *changed* its appeal.
* **D: Isko Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ney mahfooz kiya thaa** (It was preserved by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - He built it originally, but the text says it was *protected after* the fire, not preserved by him before it.



"
Cambodia key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Cambodia ney 1772 mein Thailand parr hamlah kiya thaa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that **Thai people attacked Cambodia** and destroyed Nome Faine in 1772. It does **not** say Cambodia attacked Thailand.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Vietnami logon ney Phnom Phen ko tabah kiya thaa** - The passage mentions Vietnamese attacks on Cambodia in the late 18th century. While it doesn't *specifically* mention Phnom Penh, it's a reasonable inference that attacks would target major cities.
*   **C: 18vein sadee key aaghaz mein Vietnamiyon ney Cambodia parr hamlah kiya thaa** - The text confirms Vietnamese attacks occurred in the 18th century.
*   **D: Thai logon ney Phnom Phen ko tabah kiya thaa** - The passage states the Thai destroyed Nome Faine. While not Phnom Penh directly, it indicates the Thai were destructive during their attacks.



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah Cambodia key hamlah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Thai logon ney Cambodia parr kayi baar hamlah kiya thaa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""18vein sadee mein thayiyon nay kambodiya parr kayee baar hamlay kiyey"" (In the 18th century, the Thais attacked Cambodia many times).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vietnamiyon ney Cambodia parr motaddid baar hamlah kiya thaa** - While the passage mentions Vietnamese attacks, it says they occurred towards the *end* of the century, not consistently throughout.
* **B: Thai aur Veitnami logon ney Cambodia par 1772 mein halah kiya thaa** -  The passage states Thais destroyed Nom Penh in 1772, but doesn't mention a joint attack.
* **C: Vietnami logon ney Phnom Phen ko tabah kiya thaa** - The passage doesn't attribute the destruction of Phnom Penh to the Vietnamese. It says the Thais destroyed Nom Penh.



"
Dutch East India Company ney Taiwan mein apney waqt key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiya nahien kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Qing saltanat key liye Taiwan key cede control ki khawahish ki** (Desired to cede control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty).

Here's why:

The passage states the Dutch East India Company established a base in *southwestern* Taiwan (jonub maghribi taiwan) - option A is incorrect as it mentions southeastern Taiwan (jonub mashriqi hissah).  They *did* change local agricultural practices (option B) and employed Chinese laborers on their plantations (option C). However, there's no mention in the passage of the Dutch wanting to hand Taiwan over to the Qing Dynasty. In fact, the passage details the *Qing Dynasty eventually conquering* Taiwan from the Dutch.

Therefore, the Dutch East India Company did *not* desire to cede control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty."
Shimonoseki key moahedah ney kiya qayem kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiwan parr Japan ka iqtedaar** (Japan's authority over Taiwan).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""1895 mein, pehli cheen-japan jung (1894-1895) mein shikast key baad, chang hukumat nay shamonosiki muahide parr dastakhat kiye, jis key bamojib uss nay taiwan parr apnay iqtedar say japan key haq mein dastbardari kaa aiteraf kiya, jis nay uss jazeeray parr 1945 tak hukumat kee.""  (In 1895, after defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, whereby it acknowledged the transfer of its authority over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cheen Japan ki pahli jang mein Japan ki haar** (Japan's defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War) - The treaty was *a result* of Japan's victory, not their defeat.
*   **B: Qing saltanat key taht Taiwan ka eek subaey key tor parr darjah** (Qing dynasty ranked Taiwan as a province) -  The text states this happened *before* the treaty, in 1885. The treaty changed that.
*   **C: Taiwan ki apney saaheli elaqon waapas control haasil karney ki salahiyat** (Taiwan's ability to regain control of its coastal areas) - The treaty did the opposite; it ceded control *to* Japan.



"
Kisi kimiyaa ki pH satah ki paimaish kaisey ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kimiyayi mein Hydrogen ions ki miqdaar** (The amount of Hydrogen ions in the chemical).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Test kiyey gaye chemical mein ph level ko hydrogen aayoon kee miqdar (the h in ph) say zahir kiya jaataa hay.""  This directly translates to ""The pH level of the tested chemical is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kimiyayi jitnaa buniyaadi ya tezabi hota hay** (How basic or acidic the chemical is) - While pH *relates* to acidity and basicity, it's not *how much* basic or acidic, but rather the *concentration of hydrogen ions*.
* **B: Kimiyayi mein jitney proton hotey hein** (How many protons are in the chemical) - While hydrogen ions *are* protons, pH measures their *concentration*, not the total number of protons in a substance.
* **D: Kimiyayi mein jitney electron hotey hein** (How many electrons are in the chemical) - Electrons are important in understanding *why* hydrogen becomes an ion, but pH specifically measures hydrogen *ions*.



"
Hydrogen ions sey kisko hataya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Electron**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hydrogen barq paaray woh protoon hain jinn key electron unhein alag kartay hain (choonkeh hydrogen atoms mein eek protoon aur eek electron parr mushtamil hotay hain).""  This directly translates to: ""Hydrogen ions are protons that are separated by their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).""

Therefore, **electrons** are what were removed from the hydrogen atom to *create* the hydrogen ion.



"
Dajah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr sheron key fakhr ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Mozakkar sey moannas tak ka tanasub yaksaan hay (The ratio of males to females is equal)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a pride consists of ""approximately thirty females and cubs *with* one to three related adult males."" This clearly indicates the ratio of males to females is *not* equal; it's heavily skewed towards females.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Wohh kutton key jhund key momasil bartao krtey hein (They behave similarly to dog packs):** The passage explicitly states that lion prides function *like* dog packs.
*   **C: Mozakkaro moannas sab qareeb sey motallique hein (Males and females are all closely related):** The passage says the males are ""related"" to the females and that females are a large family of sisters and daughters.
*   **D: Wohh mohlik aur samaaji dono hein (They are both dangerous and social):** The passage highlights their social nature (prides, close family bonds) and their dangerousness as hunters.

Therefore, option B is the only statement *not* supported by the information in the passage.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr sheron key bartao ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Doosri badi billiyon key momasil unka bartao** (Their behavior is similar to that of other big cats).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that lion behavior is *different* from other big cats.** It points out that their social behavior and hunting style resemble canines (wolves/dogs) more than other felines.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Wohh bahut samaaji hein** (They are very social) - The passage directly says lions are the most social of the big cats, living in prides.
* **B: Unkaa bartao bhediyon key bartao sey motawazin hay** (Their behavior is similar to that of wolves) - The passage compares lion behavior to wolves/dogs.
* **C: Mozakkar aur moannas dono shikaar key liye bahut ziyaadah mohlik hein** (Both males and females are very dangerous hunters) - The passage states they are formidable hunters.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
Khargosh kis qism key shikaari key liye aam shikaar hota hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Darmiyanah size waali billiyan (Medium-sized cats)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Inn key taht darmiyana qadd kee billiyan hain jinn kee khoraak darmiyana qadd key shikaar hain khargoshon say leker...""  This directly translates to ""Among them are medium-sized cats whose food are medium-sized prey, from rabbits...""

Therefore, rabbits are typical prey for medium-sized cats.



"
Ziyadah choti billiyaan aam tor parr darjah zail mein sey kiska shikaar karti hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Choohey (Mice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bahut see chhote qadd kee billiyan bashomool ghareloo billiyon key jo bary taadad mein paaye jaaney waale keedon makodon aur **choohon** ko khaa jaati hain.""  This directly translates to ""...many small cats including domestic cats that eat a large number of insects, spiders and **mice**.""

The passage specifically mentions mice as the prey of many small cats, including house cats.  The other options (rabbits, deer) are prey for *larger* cats mentioned earlier in the text.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Billi jaisey janwaar key shikaar key tariqah ka hissah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Apney gardo nawah mein chalaang laganaa (Leaping into areas with tall grass)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the cheetah's hunting methods as:

*   **Following scent:** ""Medani cheetay khushbo kee benaa parr aur jis jagah rehte hain vahan sunghte hoay shikaar kaa peecha kartay hain"" (Cheetahs follow the scent and listen in the area where they live while hunting).
*   **Night vision and stealth:** ""Woh shabanah basarat key zariye tariki mein achhi tarah dekh aur chupke say aagay bhee badh saktay hain"" (They can see well in the dark with night vision and also move forward stealthily).
*   **Ambush and blend in:** ""medani cheeta apnay gird wo pesh key saath ghul mill karr apnay shikaar parr hamlay kartay aur inn ko pakadtay hain"" (Cheetahs blend in with the vegetation around them and attack their prey to catch them).
*   **Hunting smaller animals:** ""medani cheeta jinn janwaron kaa shikaar karta hay woh uss say kaafi chhote janwar hotay hain"" (The animals the cheetah hunts are much smaller than itself).

The passage **does not** mention cheetahs leaping into tall grass as part of their hunting strategy. While they use vegetation for camouflage, the text doesn't describe a *leap* into it.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon billi jaysey janwar ki durust tor parr wazahat nahein karta hay? ,"The correct answer is **C: Unkey sunghney ka hassah kamzor hay (Their sense of smell is weak)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that plains cheetahs *rely on their sense of smell* to track prey (""Science daanon ko lagtaa hay keh medani cheetay khushbo kee benaa parr aur jis jagah rehte hain vahan sunghte hoay shikaar kaa peecha kartay hain""). Therefore, saying their sense of smell is weak is a misrepresentation of the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Wohh raat mein achey sey shikaar karney key qaabil hein (They are capable of hunting well at night):** The passage states they can see well in the dark (""shabanah basarat key zariye tariki mein achhi tarah dekh saktay hain"").
* **B: Wohh khamushi sey chaltey hein (They move silently):** The passage mentions they move stealthily (""chupke say aagay bhee badh saktay hain"").
* **D: Wohh chotey janwaron ka shikaar karney ko tarjeeh detey hein (They prefer to hunt small animals):** The passage directly states they hunt smaller animals (""medani cheeta jinn janwaron kaa shikaar karta hay woh uss say kaafi chhote janwar hotay hain"").



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko tiger ki sabsey badi taaqat nahein samjha jaata hay?,"The passage states the cheetah is *not* good at climbing (""cheeta chadh (achhi tarah nahein)""). The other options - roaring, jumping, and pulling - are all things the cheetah *can* do, albeit sometimes differently than other big cats.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Chadhna (Climbing)**.
"
Darjah zail mein sey ko tigaron aur sheron key darmiyaan mukhtalif hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Unki dahaad ki awaaz (Their roar sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Cheeta kee dahaad sher kee bhar poor aawaz waali dahaad jaisi nahein, balkeh badd mezaji key saath cheekhe gaye alfaz say ziyadah moshabah hoti hain."" (Cheetah's roar is not like the deep, booming roar of a lion, but more resembles words shouted in a bad temper.) This directly highlights a difference in the sound of their roars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unki tairaaki ki salahiyat (Their swimming ability):** The passage states cheetahs *can* swim, but doesn't compare it to lions/tigers.
*   **C: Unkey kudney ka faslah (Their jumping distance):** The passage says cheetahs can jump well, but doesn't compare it to lions/tigers.
*   **D: Unkey khinchney ki taqat (Their pulling strength):** The passage says cheetahs are 5 times stronger than a strong human, but doesn't compare it to lions/tigers.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, deegar mahireene hayatiyaat sey pahley Robert Hooke ney keya kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Marey huey khaliyon ka moshahedah kiya** (Observed dead cells).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""woh pehla shakhs thaa jis nay murdah khalliyaat kaa moshahidah kiya."" (He was the first person to observe dead cells). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hayatiyaat ko dekhney key liye khurd been istemaal kiya** (Used a microscope to see biology) - While he *used* a microscope, the passage focuses on *what* he saw, not just the tool he used. Many biologists use microscopes.
* **C: Chotey morabbon ka moshahedah kiya** (Observed small squares) - He observed shapes *like* small squares, but the key point is he saw cells in cork, which were dead.
* **D: Hayatiyaat ki sabsey choti faal ekaayion ki daryaaft karna** (Discovering the smallest functional units of biology) - He didn’t *discover* cells as functional units; he was the first to *observe* them.  The passage doesn't credit him with understanding their function, only seeing them.



"
Lafze “cell” ki asal ka matlab kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Chota kamrah**.

The passage states: ""Cell ko laatini lafz celiya say lia gayaa hay, jis kaa matlab chhota kamrah hota hay"" which translates to ""The word 'cell' is derived from the Latin word 'celiya', which means 'small room'"". 

Therefore, the origin of the word ""cell"" means ""small room""."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, ziyadah tar janwaron mein keya karney ki salahiyat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Chalney** (Walking).

The text explicitly states: ""زیادہ تر جانور چل سکتے ہیں"" which translates to ""Most animals can walk.""

While the text mentions animals can dig, swim, and fly, it specifically highlights *walking* as the ability possessed by *most* animals."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh janwaron mein keya nahein hota hay?","The correct answer is **C: Dimaagh** (Brain).

The text explicitly states: ""Sirf janwaron key paas dimagh hay (garcheh tamaam janwaron key paas nahein hay; misal key tor parr jaili machli key paas dimagh nahein hay)."" This translates to: ""Only animals have brains (although not all animals have them; for example, jellyfish do not have brains).""

Therefore, some animals *do not* have brains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khaliye** (Cells) - The text doesn't mention cells. All living things are made of cells, so it's implied animals have them.
*   **B: Hazam karney ki salahiyat** (Ability to digest) - The text states animals ""hazm kartay hain"" (digest).
*   **D: Khaney ki salahiyat** (Ability to eat) - The text states animals ""khaatay hain"" (eat).



"
Photosynthesis key marhalah mein podon ki kiss sey moawanat hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Suraj (Sun)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Poday photocenthesis ke zariah apna khaana **dhoop mein** banatay hain."" (Plants make their food through photosynthesis in the **sunshine**.)

Photosynthesis *requires* sunlight as its energy source.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saayah (Shadow)** - Shadows are the *result* of plants, not something they use for photosynthesis.
* **B: Janwar (Animals)** - Animals benefit from plants, but aren't involved in the process of photosynthesis itself.
* **C: Gheza (Food)** - Plants *produce* food through photosynthesis, they don't need food to *do* photosynthesis.



"
Kiya cheez insaan saans sey chodtey hein jo podey saans sey letey hein?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Poday woh oxygen chhodte hain jisay insaan songhta hay, aur woh insaanon key zariah baahar chhoday gaye (sans key zariah baahar chhoday gaye) carbon dyoxide apnay andar jazb karta hay.""  This translates to: ""Plants release oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide released by humans (through breath).""

Therefore, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which plants take in.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsi misaal irteqaa key marhalah ki rokawat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Choti jamaat ka nayi jagah mein badheny mein nakaam hona** (A small group failing to establish itself in a new location).

Here's why:

The passage explains speciation (takhsis) as a process *following* isolation and adaptation to a new environment.  If a small group *fails* to establish itself in a new environment, the process of adaptation and eventual divergence *doesn't happen*.  It halts the evolutionary process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eek aabadi key hissah ka naye mahaul mein muntaqil hona** (A portion of a population moving to a new environment) - This is the *starting point* for speciation, not a roadblock.  It's the initial isolation.
* **C: Eek aabadi ki motabeqat karna, yeah eek naye mahaul mein mowafiqat hoti hay** (A population adapting, which is adapting to a new environment) - Adaptation is a *key part* of the evolutionary process and speciation, not an obstacle.
* **D: Eek aabadi ka hadsaati tor parr do ki tashkeel karna** (A population accidentally forming two groups) -  This is related to initial separation, but doesn't necessarily stop evolution; it can *lead* to it.



The passage clearly states that isolation *leads to* adaptation, and adaptation *leads to* divergence. If the initial establishment in the new environment fails, that chain is broken."
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah takhsees key marhalah ki durust tor parr wazahat karta hay? ,"The correct answer is **C: Yeah nayi parjatiyon ki tashkeel ka hawalah deta hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly defines takhsees (speciation) as ""sirf nayi parjatiyon kee tashkil hay"" (simply the formation of new species).** The entire paragraph describes the process *leading to* the formation of new species due to adaptation to different environments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeah uss waqt waqea hota hay jabb koyi nayi aabadi mowafiqat karney key qaabil na ho (This happens when a new population is unable to adapt).**  The passage describes adaptation *leading* to speciation, not failure to adapt.  It’s the *success* in adapting to a new environment that drives the process.
* **B: Yeah irteqaa key marhalah ka ahem pahlu hay (This is an important aspect of evolution).** While true, this is too broad. The passage isn’t just saying speciation is *part* of evolution, it's *defining* what speciation *is*.
* **D: Iska woqoo naguzer hay (Its occurrence is inevitable).** Again, true (stated in the passage), but doesn't specifically define *what* speciation is.  It describes *how* it happens.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the definition and explanation of *takhsees* provided in the passage."
Gardish system ka konsa hissah dil tak khoon ko pahunchata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ragein (Veins)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Khoon dill say eek aise tube mein jaataa hay jis ko arteries kehtay hain aur vahan say dill kee taraf eek aise tube mein aata hay jis ko vein kehtay hain.""  (Blood goes from the heart in a tube called arteries and comes back *to* the heart in a tube called veins.)

Therefore, veins are the tubes that carry blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sharyanein (Arteries):** Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **B: Bareek royein (Capillaries):** Capillaries are the smallest tubes, involved in exchange of substances with tissues, not directly bringing blood *to* the heart.
* **C: Aaza (Organs):** Organs are part of the circulatory system but don't *carry* blood to the heart.
"
Konsey tube gardish system mein sabsey chotey hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Bareek royein** (Capillaries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""sab say chhote tube ko kaapi lareez kehtay hain"" which translates to ""the smallest tube is called capillaries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sharyanein (Arteries):**  The passage says arteries carry blood *from* the heart, they are not the smallest tubes.
* **C: Ragein (Veins):** The passage says veins carry blood *to* the heart, they are also not the smallest tubes.
* **D: Aaza (Organs):** Organs are not tubes in the circulatory system.



"
Eek keedey ki apney paron ko waapas tah karney ki salahiyat darjah zail mein sey kisko badhati hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaghon ko chipana (Hiding places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beshtar keedon ko apnay parr yaa pankh wapas jism key saath joad saknay key ahal honey kaa fayedah milta hay. Yeah inn ko wahshi haiwanat say chhupnay key liye chhoti jaghon kaa eek badaa range fraham karta hay.""  

This translates to: ""Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back against their bodies. This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.""

Therefore, the ability to fold wings primarily *increases* their ability to hide.  Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Gheza ki farahami (Food availability):** While flying helps find food, folding wings doesn't directly relate to *finding* food, but to protection.
*   **C: Saathiyon ko talash karna (Searching for partners):** Again, flying aids in this, but folding wings doesn't.
*   **D: Udaan ki raftaar (Flight speed):** Folding wings doesn’t affect flight speed; it affects concealment.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon ebarat mein kisi aisi cheez key tor parr mazkoor nahein hay jo kisi keedey ki udney ki salahiyat sey motassir hoti ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Zindagi ki muddat (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on *how* flying ability affects a bug's life:**
    *   **Gheza ekattha karna (Gathering food):** The passage explicitly states flying helps find food more easily.
    *   **Kaar kardagi (Functionality/Action):**  Flying allows easier elimination of enemies.
    *   **Afzaishe nasal (Reproduction):** The passage implies finding mates is easier with flight (searching for companions).
*   **The passage *doesn't* mention how flying affects a bug's lifespan.** It doesn't say flying makes them live longer or shorter.

Therefore, lifespan is the only option not directly tied to the benefits of flight described in the text.



"
Darjah zail konsi khosusiyat aam tor parr dinosaur sey wabastah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankhein (Feathers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some believe dinosaurs survived and are now birds. It then points out that people *don't* readily accept birds as dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly. This implies feathers are the key difference people focus on when distinguishing birds from what they picture as dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pichley pair par chalna (Walking on hind legs):** The passage explicitly states birds walk on their hind legs ""like tea-racks."" This is a dinosaur-like trait.
*   **C: Andey dena (Laying eggs):** The passage states birds lay eggs, and this is also a dinosaur characteristic.
*   **D: Panjon walaa pair (Having claws/talons):** The passage mentions birds have claws/talons on their feet, another dinosaur-like feature.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko aam tor parr parindon aur dinosaur ki mushtarekah khosusiyat nahein samjha jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Udney kiu salahiyat (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people *don't* accept birds as dinosaurs because they fly. The passage highlights similarities like claws, laying eggs, and walking on two legs.  The ability to fly is presented as the primary difference used to argue *against* birds being dinosaurs. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Andey dena (Laying eggs):** The passage explicitly mentions birds lay eggs, a dinosaur-like trait.
*   **B: Chalney key liye pichley do pairon ka istemaal karna (Using two legs to walk):** The passage states birds walk on their hind legs like dinosaurs.
*   **D: Panjon waley pair (Clawed feet):** The passage specifically points out birds have claws and toes.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Khajoor ki tarah key podah ka konsa hissa eek Triceratops key liye khana mumkin hosakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Tez pattiyaan (Sharp leaves)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeah poday chhote palm key poday jaise hotay hain jinn key siray parr tez nokeeli pattiyan hoti hain."" (These plants were like small palm trees with sharp, pointed leaves at the ends.) and ""Tanaa khaaney say pehle patton ko utaarnay keliye sah qarni sosaar apni qawee chonch kaa istemaal karsakta thaa"" (The horned dinosaur could use its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the stem). 

Therefore, the Triceratops could potentially eat the sharp leaves of the palm-like plant. The passage also mentions roots (jad) being chewed, but focuses on the leaves as the initial part consumed.  The stem (tana) is mentioned *after* removing the leaves, implying it's not the primary edible part. Fruits (fal) are not mentioned at all.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko eek Triceratops key liye khana sabsey zaiyadah mumkin hay? ","The passage states Triceratops had incredibly strong teeth capable of chewing not only leaves but also branches and roots. It also mentions some scientists believe they ate cycads - small palm-like plants with sharp, pointed leaves.  It further notes that while some believe cycads were poisonous, *some* animals, like parrots (related to dinosaurs), can eat poisonous leaves and fruits.

Considering this, the most likely food for a Triceratops from the options provided is **B: Sakhat shaakhon walaa eek podah** (A plant with tough branches). 

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Eek sloth** - Sloths are animals, not food.
* **C: Eek totaa** - Parrots are animals, not food.
* **D: Zahreeley fal waala eek podah** - The passage casts doubt on Triceratops eating poisonous plants, even though some animals can.  The *most* likely food would be something they *could* easily eat, and tough branches fit that description.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsey darjah zail khel ko wasee paimaney parr Itly key sabsey shumaali khitton mein mashhoor hay?","The correct answer is **A: Football**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sarmayi khel shumali mintaqon mein ziyadah maqbool hain"" (Capital sports are more popular in the northern regions). And earlier, it mentions ""Maqbool khelon mein football, basket ball..."" (Among the popular sports are football, basketball...). Since capital sports are popular in the north, and football is listed as a popular sport, football is the most widely known sport in the northern regions of Italy according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Volleyball** - While listed as a popular sport, it isn't specifically linked to the northern regions.
*   **C: Baraf raani (Ice Skating)** - The text mentions *ice hockey*, and says ""atalvi log bain alaqwami khelon aur olympic key muqabilon mein hissah letay hain"" (winter athletes participate in international competitions and the Olympics). This implies winter sports are practiced, but doesn't state *ice skating* is widely popular.
*   **D: F1 motor ki daud (F1 motor racing)** - The text lists it as a popular sport, but doesn't connect it to the northern regions specifically.



"
"Ebarat mein di gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsey khel mein itly key liye aalami championship ki jeet haasil hui hay?","The correct answer is **A: Football**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Itly kee qomi football team...2006 mein fifa world cup kee champion thee."" (Italy's national football team...was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.)

Therefore, Italy achieved a world championship victory in **football**.
"
Kis waqea key baad Luxembourg key makhsus hissey Belgian ban gaye thay?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgian ka inqilaab (Belgian Revolution)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Belgium key aaj key dor key hissay maazi mein lagzambarg kaa hissah they lekin 1830 key inqilabi belgium key baad belgium mein shaamil ho gaye.""  This translates to: ""Parts of today's Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg but joined Belgium after the 1830 revolution in Belgium.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pahli aalami jang (World War I)** - The text says Germany occupied Luxembourg during both World Wars, but doesn't mention this leading to parts becoming Belgian.
*   **C: Doosri aalami jang (World War II)** - Same as above.
*   **D: European Union ki buniyaad (Foundation of the European Union)** - Luxembourg was a founding member, but this didn't cause it to lose territory to Belgium."
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Luxembourg ki gair jaanibdari ko motassir kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Jarmani ka qabzah (Germany's occupation)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lagzeemborg nay hameshah eek ghairjanibdar mulk rehney kee koshish kee hay magar uss parr jang azeem awwal aur jang azeem doim mein germani nay qabzah kiya thaa.""  This directly means that Germany's occupation *affected* Luxembourg's neutrality, even though they tried to remain neutral.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: European Union mein shaamil hona (Joining the European Union):** While significant for Luxembourg, the text doesn't say this *affected* its neutrality, only that it was a founding member.
*   **C: Belgian ka inqilaab (Belgian Revolution):** This happened *before* Luxembourg's modern independence and influenced Belgium, not Luxembourg's neutrality.
*   **D: Aazad mulk bananaa (Becoming an independent country):** Becoming independent is a step *towards* potentially being neutral, but doesn't directly affect the neutrality itself - it's the actions *after* independence that matter.



"
Turkii key kul elaaqah mein sey kitna morabbah kilometer Europe mein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage explicitly states: ""23764 morabbaa kilometer (9174 morabbaa meel) europ mein hay."" (23764 square kilometers (9174 square miles) are in Europe)."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, taqrban kitna meel lamba turkii hay?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Turki kaa raqbah 1600 kelometer (1,000 meel) say ziyadah lamba aur 800 kelometer (500 meel) chodaa hay."" (Turkey is more than 1600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 kilometers (500 miles) wide.)

Therefore, Turkey is approximately 1000 miles long."
Vatican shahar mein kiskey liye latini zubaan istemaal hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Mazhabi taqribaat**.

The passage explicitly states: ""laatini zubaan aksar mazhabi taqribaat mein istemaal hoti hay"" (Latin language is often used in religious ceremonies). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roz marrah ki mowasilat (Daily communication):** The passage states Italian is used for everyday communication.
* **C: Qanoon saazi (Lawmaking):**  The passage states Latin is used in lawmaking *and* official correspondence.
* **D: Daftari mowasilat (Official correspondence):** The passage states Latin is used in lawmaking *and* official correspondence. However, the question specifically asks about Latin use in Vatican City, and the passage states Latin is *often* used in religious ceremonies, making it the most direct answer.



"
"Vatican shahar mein, Itly zubaan kiskey liye istemaal nahein hoti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mazhabi taqribaat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""laatini zubaan aksar mazhabi taqribaat mein istemaal hoti hay"" (Latin language is often used in religious ceremonies).  This means Italian is *not* used in religious ceremonies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qanoon saazi** - The passage says Vatican City uses Latin for lawmaking (""Vatican city apni qanoon saazi mein atalvi zubaan istemaal karti hay"").
*   **B: Daftari mowasilat** - The passage also states Latin is used for official communication (""Vatican city apni daftari mawasilat mein atalvi zubaan istemaal karti hay"").
*   **D: Roz marrah ki mowasilat** - The passage says Italian *is* used for everyday communication (""Atalian bhee rozmarrah boli jaaney waali zubaan hay"")."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko umdah computeron parr aawaz khalt malt karney sey faayedah hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mosiqi (Music)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mausiqi ko omuman pechidah computers kaa istemaal karkay record kiya jaataa hay taakeh aawazon par mazeed kam kiya jaye aur unhein aapas mein milaya jaye.""  This directly translates to ""Music is generally recorded using complex computers so that sounds can be further worked on and mixed together.""  This means music benefits from the manipulation of sounds using computers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Harkat andaziyan (Animations):** While animations *are* made on computers, the passage doesn't specifically say they benefit from *mixing* sounds.
* **C: Tasaaveer (Pictures/Images):**  The passage mentions computers are used for *altering* pictures and videos, but not sound mixing within those images.
* **D: Tameer (Construction/Building):** The passage doesn't relate to construction at all.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss mahalle waqoo key aksar makanaat ki khosusiyat mein flush waley baitul khlaa they","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hadapah aur mohan jodaro key shehron key taqriban harr ghar mein flush baitul khala thaa...""  This directly translates to ""In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet...""

The other options are mentioned as having sewage systems or toilets, but not as universally present in *almost every house* like in Mohenjo-daro.



"
Darjah zail kiss mahalle waqoo mein taraqqi yaaftah naalon key nezaam paye jatey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hadapah aur mohan jodaro key shehron key taqriban harr ghar mein flush baitul khala thaa, jo eek taraqqi yaaftah sevage nizam say munsalik thaa."" (Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets, which were connected to an advanced sewage system).

The other options are mentioned as having sanitation practices, but not the *advanced* sewage systems found in Harappa.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon eek skater key mudney ki wajah hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Skate key blade key nichey thoda sa mudan** (The slight curvature at the bottom of the skate blade).

**Here's why:**

The passage explicitly explains *how* a skater turns:  ""Choon keh blade kaa bottom halka tedha hay lehaza jab blade eek yaa doosri samt jhukta hay to uss kaa kanarah jo barf key contact mein hay woh bhee tedha ho jaataa hay. Uski wajah say scatter kaa rukh murh jaataa hay..."" (Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade leans to one side or the other, the edge that is in contact with the snow also becomes curved. Because of this, the direction of the scatter changes...).

This directly links the *curve of the blade* and the *leaning of the skate* to the direction of the turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Stake key blade parr dohrey kinaarey** (Double edges on the skate blade) - The passage doesn't mention anything about double edges.
* **C: Skater ki tamaam maharat ki satah** (The skater's overall skill level) - Skill is important, but the passage focuses on the *mechanism* of the turn, not the skater's ability.
* **D: Baraf ka meyaar** (The quality of the ice) - Ice quality affects skating, but it's not the *direct cause* of turning as explained in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr jadid baraf key stake ki blade parr suraakh ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Jhuka hua (Angled/Inclined)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Choon keh blade kaa bottom halka tedha hay... (Because the bottom of the blade is slightly *tilted/angled*...)"". This tilt is the key to how the skate steers.  The passage explains that the angled blade causes the edge in contact with the ice to also become angled, changing the direction of the scatter (spray).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dohrey kinarey waala (Double-edged):** While skates *have* two edges, the passage doesn't focus on that feature as the explanation for steering.
*   **B: Muda hua (Blunt/Rounded):**  A blunt blade wouldn't allow for precise edge control and steering.
*   **C: Kamaan numa (Arched/Bow-shaped):** The passage describes a *tilt* or angle, not an arc in the blade's shape.



Therefore, **Jhuka hua (angled/inclined)** is the only option that accurately reflects the described feature of the new ice skate blade."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa tariqah kaar hay jo atoms ko roshni sey ziyadah energy ko khatam karney ki ijazat deta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Taabkari ka hausalah afzaa ikhraaj** (Stimulated Emission).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that atoms release energy gained from light by *producing a small particle of light called a ""photon""*.  The passage then defines this process as **""shuaa kaa mutaharrik ikhraaj""** which is translated to **""stimulated emission""**.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taabkari (Radiation):** While related, radiation is a broader term. The passage specifically discusses *how* atoms release excess energy, not just that they radiate it.
* **B: Photons ka hausalah afzaa ikhraaj (Stimulated Release of Photons):** This isn't the term used in the passage.
* **C: Photon:** A photon *is* the particle released, but it's not the *process* that allows the energy release.



Therefore, **Taabkari ka hausalah afzaa ikhraaj (Stimulated Emission)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Kis wajah sey eek atom photon ka ikhraaj karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah energy chodna (Releasing excess energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that atoms release photons to *get back to their previous energy level* after gaining energy from light. This implies they are releasing the *excess* energy they absorbed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chamakdaar roshni ki wajah sey moharrik (Motivated by bright light):**  Bright light *causes* the energy absorption, but isn't the reason for *releasing* a photon.
* **C: Gair mustahkam energy ki sathein (Unstable energy levels):** While gaining energy *puts* the atom into an unstable state, the passage focuses on returning *to* a stable state by releasing the energy.  It doesn't say the instability itself causes the release.
* **D: Taabkari ka eek manfi radde amal (A negative reaction of radiation):** The passage doesn't describe the process as a ""negative reaction"" or anything related to radiation specifically, but rather a natural return to a lower energy state.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, keya hadsati tor parr eek roshni key bulb key kaam karna band karney ki wajah ban jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **C: Bulb key andar key soot ka jal jaana** (The filament inside the bulb burning out).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sainkadon ghanton key operation key baad bulb kaa flament bilakhir jaal gayaa aur roshni key bulb nay mazeed kam karnaa band karr diyaa."" This directly translates to ""After hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb's filament finally burned out and the light bulb stopped working altogether.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Roshni key band ko sahi tariqah sey band na kiya ja rahaa ho** (Not turning the light switch off properly) - The passage focuses on the bulb *failing* after use, not on the switch being faulty.
* **B: Bulb ki dhaat ki buniyaad ko sirf juzwi tor parr socket mein rakhnaa** (Only partially leaving the metal base of the bulb in the socket) - This is mentioned as a *safety hazard* when *changing* the bulb, not as a cause of it failing.
* **D: Socket mein bijli key bahao ka nichey dikhana** (Showing a decrease in the flow of electricity in the socket) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the electricity flow decreasing.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon roshni key bulb ko badaltey waqt mumkanah tor parr chooney key liye khatarnaak ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Bulb ki buniyaad (Bulb's base)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""agar aap socket key andar yaa bulb key dhaati hissay ko juzwi tor par socket key andar baaqi rahte hoay hee chhoo lete hain to iss say aap ko bijli kaa shadeed jhatka lag sakta hay."" (If you touch the inside of the socket or the *metal part of the bulb* while it's still partially inside the socket, you could get a severe electric shock).  The base of the bulb is the metal part.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Soot (Thread)** - The thread is not a conductive part.
*   **B: Light ki button (Light switch)** - The switch controls the electricity, but you need to turn it OFF *before* changing the bulb, making it safe to touch after that.
*   **D: Cable (Cable)** - While a damaged cable is dangerous, the passage focuses on the immediate danger of touching the bulb and socket.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nucleus key motafarriq hotey waqt keya hota hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tawanayi chodi jaati hay (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tab nucleus ko dobarah taqsim karnay kee wajah say uss mein say kuchh tawanayi khaarij hoti hay."" This directly translates to ""then, due to the re-division of the nucleus, some energy is released.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Protons haasil hotey hein (Protons are formed):** The passage doesn't say protons are *formed* during the split, just that they exist within the nucleus.
*   **C: Atom gair mustahkam bann jaatey hein (Atoms become unstable):** The passage states *some* atoms *already* have unstable nuclei. The split is a result of instability, not the cause of it.
*   **D: Neutrons gum ho jaatey hein (Neutrons disappear):** The passage doesn't state anything about neutrons disappearing. It simply mentions they are part of the nucleus.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon lambi doori key zameen tak waapas aaney waali callz ki akkasi karta hay,"The correct answer is **B: Satellites**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jab aap kisee aise aadmi ko call kartay hain jo hazaar meel door hay to aap **settellite** kaa istemaal kartay hain."" (When you call someone who is a thousand miles away, you use **satellites**.)  It then describes how satellites receive and relay the signal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Door beenein (Telescopes)** - The passage mentions telescopes are used by scientists to *observe* space, not to relay phone calls.
* **C: Roshniyaan (Lights)** - Lights have nothing to do with long-distance calls.
* **D: Rockets** - Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, but don't handle the calls themselves.



"
Inmein sey kiska istemaal doorbeen ko khala mein rakhney key liye hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Rockets**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Satellite ko rocket key zariye khalaa mein bheja gayaa."" (Satellites are sent into space via rockets.)  It also mentions needing rockets to launch both satellites *and* telescopes (""Khalaa mein settelite yaa doorbeen ko chhodnay key liye 100 fit oonchayi key devhaikal rocket kee zaroorat hoti hay."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Roshni ki kirnein (Light rays):** The passage mentions light is *affected* by the atmosphere, but doesn't say it's used to launch anything.
* **C: Zameen ka mahaul (Earth's atmosphere):** The passage says the atmosphere *hinders* viewing, necessitating space-based telescopes, not that it's used for launching them.
* **D: 100 fit oonchayi parr satellites (Satellites at 100 feet high):**  The passage says 100 feet is the height the *rocket* needs to be, not where the satellite stays.



"
Waqt key guzarney ka suraag laganey key liye eek gardish waley waqea key baarey mein kis cheez ko note karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Takraar (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aap kisee chakkar waale waaqiye kee takraar kaa moshahidah karkay waqt guzarnay kee nishandahi aap khud karr saktay hain. chakkarwala waaqiah eek aisi cheez hay jo baar baar baqayedgi key saath hota hay."" 

This translates to: ""You can indicate the passage of time by observing the *repetition* of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens repeatedly with regularity.""

Therefore, to track the passage of time using a cyclical event, you need to note its **repetition** (takraar).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doraniyah (Duration)** - While duration is related to time, the passage specifically points to *observing the cycle itself* as the indicator.
*   **C: Asar (Effect)** - Effects are consequences, not the indicator of time's passage itself.
*   **D: Mushkil (Difficult)** -  The passage notes that understanding time is difficult, but it doesn't relate to *detecting* its passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi waqea ka konsa pahlu mowaznah key liye istemaal honey walaa waqt hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Tewalat (Duration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Waqt yeah bhee hay keh ham kiss tarah waaqiaat key doraniye (tewalat) kaa mawaznah kartay hain.""  This directly translates to ""Time is also how we measure the *duration* of events.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Takraar (Repetition):** While the passage *mentions* repetition as an indicator of time passing (with the example of a cyclical event), it's not what we *measure* with time.
*   **C: Tajarbah (Experience):** Experience is related to time, but isn't the aspect being compared *by* time.
*   **D: Asar (Effect):**  Effects are results of events, not the aspect of events measured by time.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko taaj key waris key liye aam samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **D: Foj mein shaamil honey sey pahley university janaa**

Here's why:

The passage states that previously, a royal heir would *directly* join the army after finishing school. However, Charles *went to university* (Cambridge) *before* joining the military. This was a departure from tradition and is presented as the new, common practice for the heir. The passage specifically highlights that Charles was the first royal family member to earn a degree. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 2:2 degree Haasil karna (Earning a 2:2 degree):** While the passage mentions his degree, it doesn't suggest this is the common thing for an heir to do. It focuses on *going* to university, not the grade achieved.
* **B: Foj mein shaamil honey key liye university chodna (Leaving university to join the army):** The passage implies going *before* the army, not leaving university *for* the army.
* **C: Tarikh padhna (Studying history):** Studying history is what Charles *did* at university, but it’s not the change in tradition being described.



"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Charles keya karney walaa pahla shakhs thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Eek degree haasil karna** (Earning a degree).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Charles bartanvi shahi khandaan kaa pehla member thaa jisay degree di gayee thee."" (Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: School khatam karney sey pahley foj mein shaamil hona** (Joining the army before finishing school) - The passage says previously heirs *went directly* to the army, but Charles *didn't* do that.
*   **B: Asaare qadeemah ki padhayi karna** (Studying archaeology) - He *did* study archaeology, but the passage highlights him being the first to get a degree, not the first to study that subject.
*   **D: Taslis college mein shirkat karna** (Attending Trinity College) -  He *attended* Trinity College, but the significant fact is *receiving the degree* from that college.



"
Trygvasson ka beda kis mulk ka thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text explicitly states: ""Uss beday kee qeyadat norway key baashinde aulf traguason nay kee..."" (That fleet was led by Aulf Trygvasson, a resident of Norway...). 

Therefore, Trygvasson's fleet was from Norway."
Tarikh mein kis waqt jarmani ney Estonia parr eek mazboot saqafati asar dala thaa?,"The passage states that German cultural influence was present in Northern Estonia ""15 vein sadee key aiss paas"" - which translates to ""around 15th century"". 

Let's estimate how many years ago the 15th century was:

* Current year is 2024.
* 2024 - 1500 = 524 years ago.

Therefore, the closest answer is **C: Taqriban 600 saal pahley** (Approximately 600 years ago). While not exact, it's the most accurate option given the information in the passage.



"
Estonia ki zubaan kiss cheez sey motassir hui thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Jarmani horrufe tahajji** (German alphabets).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah german horoof tahajji parr mabni thaa..."" (It was based on German alphabets...).  It goes on to say a special character ""o/o"" was *added* to these German letters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Harf Õ/õ (The letter Õ/õ)** - While the letter is mentioned, it's a *result* of the influence, not the source of it.
* **C: Jarmani rahib (German monks)** - The monks *used* the language, they weren't the language itself. They were the agents of influence.
* **D: Khuda (God)** -  The monks wanted to bring people closer to God, but God isn't a linguistic influence.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, madri hindi boney walon ki tadaad kis unsur ki buniyaad parr kamo besh hoti rahti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Agar hindi sey bahut momasil elaaqayi zubanon ko bhi shumaar kiya jaa raha hay** (If closely related regional languages are also counted with Hindi).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""بولنے والوں کی تعداد میں تفاوُت اس پر منحصر ہے کہ قریبی طور سے باہم مربوط لہجات کی گنتی کی جاتی ہے یا نہیں۔""  This translates to: ""The difference in the number of speakers depends on whether closely related dialects are counted or not.""

This directly supports option A.  The number of native Hindi speakers fluctuates depending on whether you include very similar regional languages (dialects) *as* Hindi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar urdu bolney walon ko shumaar kiya jaa raha hay** (If Urdu speakers are being counted): The passage states Hindi and Urdu speakers *understand* each other, but doesn't say the count of Hindi speakers varies based on counting Urdu speakers.
* **C: Agar zuban ko samajh paney waley logon ko shumaar kiya jaa raha hay** (If people who understand the language are being counted): The passage *does* give a number for those who *understand* Hindi (800 million), but it says the variation in speaker numbers is about dialects, not comprehension.
* **D: Agar zuban ko padh paney waley logon ko shumaar kiya jaa raha hay** (If people who can read the language are being counted): The passage doesn't mention literacy or reading ability.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon hindi aur urdu zubanon key baarey mein sahi bayaniyah hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Wohh rasmul khatt mein mukhtalif hoti hein (They differ in writing style)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zakhirahe alfaz key lehaaz say hindi aur urdu yaksaan hain lekin tarz tehreer judagana hay"" which translates to ""In terms of vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu are the same, but the writing style is different.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dono zubanon key bolney walon key darmiyaan aam tor parr eek inqetaa hota hay (There is generally a disconnect between speakers of the two languages):**  The passage states the opposite -  ""rozmarrah kee baat cheet mein, donon zubanon key bolnay waale eek doosray ko achhi tarah samajh saktay hain"" (in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can understand each other well).
* **C: Wohh zakhirah alfaaz aur rasmul khatt donon mein momasil hoti hein (They are similar in both vocabulary and writing style):** The passage specifically says writing styles differ.
* **D: wohh zakhirah alfaaz mein mukhtalif hoti hein (They differ in vocabulary):** The passage explicitly states they *share* the same vocabulary (""zakhirahe alfaz key lehaaz say yaksaan hain"").



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Hangeul horufe tahajji key baarey mein durust haqiqat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Isko Joseon saltanat key chotey badshah ney ijaad kiya thaa** (It was invented by a younger king of the Joseon dynasty).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** King Sejong was the *fourth* king of the Joseon dynasty, not a younger/smaller one.  It emphasizes his capability and respect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Isko badshah Sejong key ahed key aaghaz mein ijaad kiya gaya thaa** (It was invented at the beginning of King Sejong's reign) - The passage states it was invented in 1444 *during* his reign.
* **B: Horufe tahajji ka asal naam Hunan Jeongeum thaa** (The original name of the alphabet was Hunan Jeongeum) - The passage states the original name was ""Honmeen Jeongeum.""
* **D: Isko jaan boojh kar ijaad kiya gaya thaa** (It was intentionally invented) - The passage explicitly states it was ""qasdan eejaad kardah"" (intentionally invented).



"
Horufe tahajji Hunmin Jeongeum aakhir kaar kiss sey badal gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

Here's why:

The passage states that King Sejong originally named the alphabet ""Honmeen Jeongeum"" but it eventually became known as ""Hangeul."" The question asks what Hunmin Jeongeum (the original name) was *replaced* with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sejong** - King Sejong was the creator, not what the alphabet was renamed to.
*   **C: Joseon** - Joseon was the dynasty, not the new name of the alphabet.
*   **D: Jeongeum** - Jeongeum was part of the *original* name, not the final name.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi zubanein Sanskrit sey motssir hui theen?","The correct answer is **D: Hindustani zubanein (Hindustani languages)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sansikrit behad pechidah aur zarkhez zubaan hay, jis nay mutaddid jadeed hindustani zubanon key maakhaz key tor parr khidmat anjaam di hay..."" 

This translates to: ""Sanskrit is a very complex and fertile language, which served as the source for many modern Hindustani languages...""

While the text *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, it doesn't say Hindustani languages are derived from Latin. It clearly states Sanskrit is the source of Hindustani languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Latini zubanein (Latin languages)** - The text compares Sanskrit *to* Latin, but doesn’t say Latin was influenced by Sanskrit.
* **B: Europee zubanein (European languages)** -  While Latin (a European language) is mentioned in comparison, the text specifically focuses on Sanskrit’s influence on Hindustani languages.
* **C: Qadeem zubanein (Ancient languages)** - This is too broad.  The text is specific about *which* ancient language influenced others.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss wajah sey Sanskrit ka istemaal kam hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Pechidgi (Complexity)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""apnishdon kee tadween key baad, **mazhabi rehnumaon kee wajah say sanskrit kamzor ho gayee**"" which translates to ""After the compilation of the Apnishads, Sanskrit weakened due to religious leaders."" While the text doesn't directly state *why* religious leaders caused it to weaken, it precedes this statement with ""Sansikrit behad **pechidah** aur zarkhez zubaan hay"" meaning ""Sanskrit is a very **complex** and fertile language.""  The implication is that its complexity contributed to its decline, especially as religious leaders likely favored simpler languages for wider understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ariyon ki hijrat (Aryan migration):** The text mentions Aryan migration as a *theory of its origin*, not a cause of its decline.
*   **C: Latini zubanein (Latin languages):** Latin is mentioned as a *comparable* language, not a reason for Sanskrit's decline.
*   **D: Darjah bandi (Grading/Classification):** This isn't mentioned as a reason for the decline in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Io parr kashishe seql key motalliq durust bayaniyah hay?","The correct answer is **D: Zameen ki kashishe seql Io ki kashishe seql ki banisbat aap parr ziyadah khinchao rakhey gee**

Here's why:

The passage states that your weight on Io is *less* than your weight on Earth (200lbs on Earth vs. 36lbs on Io). This means Earth's gravitational pull is stronger – it's pulling on you more.  Therefore, Earth exerts more gravitational force on you than Io does.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Incorrect. The passage says Earth's pull is *stronger*.
*   **B:** Incorrect.  Lower weight on Io means *less* pull, not more, and wouldn't necessarily make it harder to stand.
*   **C:** Incorrect. Lower weight on Io means you would weigh *less*, not more.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah chaand key baahari parat ki durust tor parr wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Side key paas waley mein ziyadah mota crust hay** (The side near us has a thicker crust).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah crust nazdiki jaanib taqriban 70 kelometer dabiz hay aur doosri jaanib 100 kelometer dabiz hay."" (This crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.) This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ooncheyt hisson key taht crust ziyadah patla hota hay** (The crust is thinner under the high areas): The passage says the opposite - it's *thicker* under the highlands (""maariyah key neechey patla aur pahadi elaqon key neechey motaa hay"").
* **C: Door ki side mein kam maria ho skati hay** (There may be fewer maria on the far side): The passage doesn't discuss the *number* of maria, only the crust thickness.
* **D: Ooncheyt hisson key taht kam maria ho skati hay** (There may be fewer maria under the high areas):  Again, the passage doesn't discuss the relationship between maria and highlands.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, chaand ka crust sabsey mota kahaan hota hay?","The correct answer is **C: Ooncheyt hisson key taht (Under the mountainous regions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeah crust nazdiki jaanib taqriban 70 kelometer dabiz hay aur doosri jaanib 100 kelometer dabiz hay. Yeah maariyah key neechey patla aur pahadi elaqon key neechey motaa hay."" 

This translates to: ""This crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side. It is thin under the maria and thick under the mountainous regions.""

Therefore, the crust is thickest under the mountainous regions.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiss par kuch log yaqeen rakhtey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Doosrey sayyaron parr zindagi mojud hay** (Life exists on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kuchh logon kaa manna hay keh kisee doosray sayyarey parr shayed elions yaa doosri zindagiyan abad hon gee"" - which translates to ""some people believe that perhaps aliens or other life forms will inhabit another planet."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Insaano ney deegar sitaaron ka safar kiya hay** (Humans have traveled to other stars) - The passage talks about *dreaming* of such travel, not it having happened. It also suggests it's a very distant possibility.
* **B: Insaan deegar duniya ki daryaaft key qaabil nahein hein** (Humans are not capable of discovering other worlds) - The passage doesn’t state humans *can't* discover other worlds, but rather expresses doubt about the feasibility due to the vast distances.
* **D: Sitaron key darmiyaan trillion meelon sey kam hein** (The distance between stars is less than trillions of miles) - The passage explicitly states the opposite: the distances are *in the trillions of miles*.



"
Jitna ziyadah aap suraj key markaz sey door jaatey hein konsi cheez utni hi patli hoti jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agar aap sooraj key markaz say door jaatay hain to gas nisbatan patli ho jaati hay.""  This directly translates to ""If you move away from the center of the sun, the gas becomes relatively thinner.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Plasma:** While the sun *contains* plasma, the passage specifically mentions gas becoming thinner.
*   **B: Aag:** ""Aag"" (fire) is a result of the processes within the sun, not something that thins out as you move away.
*   **D: Crust:** The sun doesn't have a crust like Earth. It's made of gases.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, suraj ka konsa hissah zameen sey maryee hay?","The correct answer is **C: Roshni ka korah (Photosphere)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sooraj key jis khaariji juzw ko ham dekhtay hain woh photo isfair kahalata hay jis key maanee """"roshni kaa golah"""" key hain.""  This translates to: ""The outer part of the sun that we see is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'.""

The question asks which part of the sun is *seen* from Earth.  Therefore, the photosphere is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Crust:**  The sun doesn't have a crust like Earth.
*   **B: Plasma:** While the sun *is* made of plasma, it's not a specific layer we see directly. Plasma is throughout the sun.
*   **D: Markaz (Core):**  The core is the center of the sun and isn't visible from Earth.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey moshahedah ney falakiyaat key nazriyah ki tayeed karney madad kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Zuhrah key marahil (Phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Yeah fezez sirf iss liye roonuma hotay hain keunkeh zahrah (yaa chand kee) soraj kee jaanib eyaan honey waali mahaz eek jaanib roshan hoti hay."" (These phases only appear because Venus, like the moon, is only illuminated on the side facing the sun.)  This observation of Venus exhibiting phases – like the moon – *directly* supported the Copernican theory that planets orbit the sun. If Venus orbited the Earth, it wouldn't show a full range of phases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zuhrah ka oboor (Transit of Venus):**  While the transit of Venus is astronomically significant, the passage doesn't mention it as the key observation.
*   **C: Suraj ki zohrah sey momaslatein (Occultations of Venus by the Sun):** The passage does not discuss occultations.
*   **D: Suraj ki chaand sey momaslatein (Occultations of the Moon by the Sun):** The passage is about Venus, not the moon.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Galileo Galilei ney 1610 mein moshahedah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Zuhrah key marahil (The phases of Venus)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Taqriban teen hazaar saal key baad, san 1610 mein, atalvi mahire falkiyaat galileo gallely nay doorbeen kaa istemaal kartay hoay moshahidah kiya keh theek chand kee tarah zahrah key bhee marahil hain"" which translates to ""Approximately three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei observed using a telescope that like the moon, Venus also has phases.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Suraj ka samna karney walaa chaand ki eek jaanib (One side of the moon facing the sun):** While the passage explains *why* we see phases (because only one side is lit by the sun), Galileo didn't observe this directly, he observed the phases themselves.
*   **C: Sayyarah ka suraj key ird gird jaana (Planets orbiting the sun):** Galileo’s observations *supported* this idea (Copernicus’s theory), but he didn't directly observe the orbits themselves in 1610.
*   **D: Zuhrah ka oboor (Transit of Venus):** The passage mentions the observation of Venus's motion *later* in 1639 by Jeremiah Horrocks, not in 1610 by Galileo.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Amazon darya kahaan sey paani jamaa karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah choti daryayein** (Many small rivers).

The text states: ""uss mein hazaaron chhote driyaon say paani bah karr jamma hota hay."" which translates to ""It collects water from thousands of small rivers.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sabsey badi darya** (The biggest river) - The text mentions Amazon compared *to* the second biggest river, but doesn't say it collects water *from* it.
*   **C: Samundar** (Ocean) - The text states Amazon *flows into* the ocean, not that it collects water from it.
*   **D: Doosri sabsey badi darya** (The second biggest river) - Similar to B, the text focuses on comparison, not water collection.



"
Konsi tareef Amazon darya sey mansub nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeah sabsey lambi darya hay (It is the longest river)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amazon nadi doosri sab say lambi... (Amazon river is the *second* longest...)."" It explicitly says it's the *second* longest, not the longest.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Yeah doosri sabsey lambi darya hay (It is the second longest river)** - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **B: Yeah sabsey badi darya hay (It is the biggest river)** - The passage says ""zameen kee sab bary nadi hay"" (it is the biggest river on land) meaning in terms of water volume.
*   **D: Yeah sabsey choudi darya hay (It is the widest river)** - The passage states ""Amazon satah zameen parr sab say chaudaa daryaa bhee hay"" (Amazon is also the widest river on earth).



"
Earat mein mazkoor kaam ki konsi line Venezuela key logon ki sabsey kam tadaad ko kaam faraham karti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Tel**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""bawajood iskay tel kee sanaat mein sirf eek feesad log kam kartay hain"" which translates to ""despite its oil industry, only one percent of the population works in it.""

This clearly indicates that the oil industry employs the smallest percentage of the Venezuelan population compared to the other options mentioned:

*   **Zaraat (Agriculture):** 1/5 (20%) of the population
*   **Sanaat (Industry):** Approximately 1/4 (25%) of the population
*   **Khidmat (Service Sector):** 2/3 (approximately 67%) of the population

Therefore, the oil industry provides employment to the fewest people."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa shobaa Venezuela key logon ki sabsey ziyadah tadaad ko kaam faraham karta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Khidmat (Service)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Venzvela key do tehayi log service sector mein..."" which translates to ""Two-thirds of the people in Venezuela are in the service sector..."".  Two-thirds is the largest proportion among the options given.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zaraat (Agriculture):** The passage says ""panchwan hissah kashtkari kaa kam karta hay"" - a fifth (or 20%) work in agriculture.
*   **C: Sanaat (Industry):** The passage says ""taqriban eek chothayi sanaat mein"" - approximately a quarter (or 25%) work in industry.
*   **D: Tel (Oil):**  The passage specifically states ""bawajood iskay tel kee sanaat mein sirf eek feesad log kam kartay hain"" - only 1% work in the oil industry.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Imtezaaj sey sitaron ko keya karney ki ijaazat milti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah bhaari anaasir ki tashkeel karney** (Creating heavier elements).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Setaray roshni aur hararat uss energy kee wajah se kharij kartay hain jo hydrogen key zarraat key inzemam say saqeel anaasir kee takhliq say banti hay.""  This directly translates to: ""Stars release light and heat because of the energy that comes from the creation of heavier elements from the combination of hydrogen particles.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imtezaaj key reactor ki tameer karney** (Building a fusion reactor): The passage mentions scientists *trying* to build a reactor, but doesn't say fusion *allows* stars to do this.
* **C: Roshni aur garmi ko chod deney** (Releasing light and heat): This is a *result* of fusion, not what fusion *allows* stars to do.
* **D: Hydrogen key atom bananey** (Creating hydrogen atoms): Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko eek mofeed imtezaaj ka reactor banaye gaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Hydrogen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that light and heat are emitted because of the energy created by the *combination of hydrogen particles* to create heavier elements. Scientists are trying to build a reactor that works the *same way*.  Therefore, hydrogen is the key ingredient for a fusion reactor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sitarey (Stars):** Stars *use* fusion, they don't *become* fusion reactors. The passage refers to *building* a reactor.
* **C: Atom (Atoms):** Atoms are the building blocks, but hydrogen specifically is the fuel source for fusion.
* **D: Tawanayi (Energy):** Energy is *released* by fusion, but isn't the material used to create it.



"
Paani ki kimiyayi banawat keya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Do hydrogen atoms aur eek oxygen atom** (Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

The text explicitly states: ""morakkab paani hydrogen key do aur oxygen key eek atom say mill karr banta hay"" which translates to ""compound water is formed by combining two hydrogen and one oxygen atom.""
"
"Jabb paani ki shaklein tabdil ho jayein gee, to konsi cheez eek jaisi rah jaye gee?","The correct answer is **A: Salmaati saakht (Chemical structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Halankeh uski jismani haalat tabdil ho sakti thee, magar uski kimiyayi haalat waisi hee barqarar rahee"" which translates to ""Although its physical state can change, its chemical state remains the same.""  ""Kimiyayi haalat"" refers to the chemical structure (salmaati saakht).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kasafat (Density)** - The passage says liquid is *denser* than gas, meaning density changes.
* **C: Jismani kaifiyat (Physical state)** - The entire point of the passage is that the physical state *does* change (gas, liquid, solid).
* **D: Maye nitrogen (Liquid nitrogen)** - Liquid nitrogen is an example used to illustrate a point, not something that remains constant when water changes states.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, makhsus qanoon nafiz karney ki koshish kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kon tees mulkon ka masalah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mulk key hukkaam ki taraf sey bhaari nigraani (Heavy oversight by state officials)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the states *didn't* cooperate with enforcing the laws passed by Congress.  They ""often did not cooperate in enforcing its laws.""  This means the problem wasn't *too much* oversight by state officials, but rather a *lack* of cooperation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct problems described in the passage:

*   **B: Congress key andar power ki kami (Lack of power within Congress):** The passage explicitly states Congress lacked the power to tax.
*   **C: Mutaafeqah manzoori ki darkaar islahaat (Amendments requiring unanimous consent):** The passage mentions that unanimous consent from the states was needed to amend the Articles, and states were often absent, making change difficult.
*   **D: Eek gair mojud qomi executive (A non-existent national executive):** The passage notes there was no national executive or judiciary.

Therefore, heavy oversight by state officials was *not* a problem; a *lack* of cooperation from them *was* the problem.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa bayaniyah inqilaabi jang key doraan markazi hukumat ki kaifiyat ki akkasi durust tor parr karta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mulk key nomaindon ki mojudgi ki kami thee** (There was a lack of presence of national representatives).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""chunki yahaan koyee qomi majlis aamilah yaa adliah mojud nahein thee"" (because there was no national legislature or judiciary). This clearly indicates a lack of national representation and institutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Congress aur mulk key hukkam ney tax naafiz kiya thaa** (Congress and the country's rulers enforced tax) - The passage says Congress *lacked the power* to collect taxes.
* **B: Dafaat mein islahaat Congress ki zimmah daari parr munhasir theen** (Amendments to the articles were the sole responsibility of Congress) - The passage states unanimous consent from the states was required for amendments, meaning it wasn't solely Congress's responsibility.
* **D: Markazi hukumat do ahem ajzaa parr mushtamil thee** (The central government consisted of two important components) - While Congress was *part* of the government, the passage emphasizes its *weakness* and the absence of other crucial branches (legislature and judiciary).  It doesn't frame it as a functional government with distinct components.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the described state of the central government during the Revolutionary War period – a significant deficiency in national representation and governing bodies."
Azadi key elaan ki pusht parr alfaaz kaisey likhey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Ooper ki taraf nichey**.

Here's why:

The passage states: *""matan dastavez key neechey aur opri hissah parr zahir hota hay""* which translates to ""the text appears on the top and bottom of the document.""  This directly indicates the words are written above and below (top to bottom) on the back of the Declaration of Independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baday faant mein (In large font):** The passage doesn't mention font size.
*   **B: Code mein (In code):** The passage specifically states it is *not* a treasure map (which could imply a coded message). It clarifies it's the wording of the declaration itself.
*   **D: Chotey faant mein (In small font):**  Again, the passage doesn't mention font size.



"
Singapore darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye jaana jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Shahri sarsabzi (Urban greenery)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the founding of the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the island into a ""garden city.""  This directly relates to a focus on urban greenery. The mention of a national flower further reinforces this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Paidal safar (Hiking/Trekking):** The passage doesn't mention hiking or trekking.
* **C: Muhim joo khel (Important games):**  The passage doesn't mention sports.
* **D: Kaar kardagi key fan (Art of craftsmanship):** While Singapore may *have* craftsmanship, the passage focuses on its botanical and garden aspects.



"
Vanda Miss Joaquim kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek phool** (A flower).

The text states ""wanda miss jokeem...ko mulk kaa qomi phool muntakhab kiya gayaa"" - meaning Wanda Miss Joaquim was selected as the *national flower* of the country. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek jazeerah** (An island) - The text talks about Singapore being an island, but Wanda Miss Joaquim is *not* the island itself.
* **C: Eek hayatiyaati park** (A botanical park) - While the text mentions the botanical gardens, Wanda Miss Joaquim isn't the park itself.
* **D: Eek qomi yadgaar** (A national monument) -  It's a flower, not a monument.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Giza ahraamon key konsey meyaar parr misr ki nayi saltanat ko rashk karnaa mumkin nahein thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Unki size (Their size)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lekin jezah mein tameer hoay ahraam kaa unn key hajm aur tameer kee khoobi key lehaaz say koyee jawab nahein.""  This translates to: ""...but the pyramids built in Giza had no answer in terms of their *size* and the quality of their construction.""

The passage explicitly states that the new kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the pyramids, but *could not match their size*.  The passage doesn't say they couldn't match the era, stone usage, or construction techniques, only that Giza's size was unmatched.



Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, barishon key hosul mein sabzah khor janwar kahaan sey safar kartey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Shumaali pahadiyaan (Northern highlands)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Barishon keliye shumali pahadiyon say maaraa nadi ko obur kartay hoay, harr saal october key aas paas taqriban 1.5 millin chara khor maveshi shumali medanon kaa rukh kartay hain"" which translates to: ""For the rains, approximately 1.5 million herbivores cross the Mara River from the northern highlands every year in October, heading towards the northern plains.""

Therefore, the herbivores *start* their journey from the northern highlands.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aprel key aas paas baaz waqt kis elaqah sey sabzi khor janwar rawanah hotey hein?","The correct answer is **A: Serengeti khittah (Serengeti region)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*April key aas paas dobarah maaraa nadi ko obur kartay hoay* [in April, around, they cross the Mara river again]... *Sarangeti elaqon mein...shaamil hain* [The Serengeti regions include...]""  This clearly indicates that around April, the animals are leaving the area *around* the Serengeti (crossing the Mara River *from* the Serengeti) and heading eastward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jonubi maidaani elaqey (Southern plains regions):** The passage describes movement *towards* the plains, not *from* them in April.
* **C: Mara darya (Mara River):** The Mara River is a *route* they cross, not an area they depart *from*.
* **D: Maasai Mara qomi reserve (Maasai Mara National Reserve):**  While the Maasai Mara is mentioned, the passage describes the animals *leaving* the broader Serengeti region *towards* the east, including the Maasai Mara, not departing *from* the Maasai Mara itself in April.



"
Operation Sealion kiss mulk ka hamlah thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Garmani**.

The text clearly states: ""Germani nay uss hamlay ko """"operation sea lyon"""" naam diyaa."" (Germany named that attack ""Operation Sea Lion"").

Therefore, Operation Sea Lion was a German attack."
Bartaniyah parr hamely ko Jarmani ney keya naam diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Germani nay uss hamlay ko """"operation sea lyon"""" naam diyaa."" (Germany named that attack ""Operation Sealion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dunkirk** - Dunkirk was a *location* of an evacuation, not the name of the planned invasion.
* **C: Kriegsmarine** - Kriegsmarine is the *German Navy*, not the name of the operation.
* **D: Shahee bahriyah** - Shahee bahriyah is the *British Navy*, not the name of the operation.



"
Afriki momalik parr qabzah key itly key mansubah mein kisko zaruri qadam key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezaafi jahaaz banana**.

Here's why:

The passage states Italy built ""chaar nayey beday"" (four new fleets) at the very beginning of the war. However, it doesn't mention further shipbuilding as a *necessary* step in their plan for conquering African territories.  The focus is on needing a launchpad for troops and overcoming British presence in Egypt.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned as necessary:

* **A: Misr mein jahazon sey chutkarah paana (Gaining freedom from ships in Egypt):** The passage explicitly states Italy needed to ""chhutkarah haasil karnaa"" (gain freedom) from British holdings and ships in Egypt.
* **C: Eek foj launch karney ka pad qaayem karna (Establishing a troop launching pad):** The passage clearly states Italy needed a ""troop launching pad"" to attack Africa.
* **D: Bartanavi buniyaadon ko tabaah karna (Destroying British bases):** This is implied by the need to gain freedom from British ""addon"" (bases/installations) in Egypt.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisko Itly ki jang ka buniyaadi maqsad samjha jaata thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Afiriki mamalik parr qabzah karna** (Conquering African countries).

The passage explicitly states: ""Itly key bunyadi ahdaaf afriqi mamalik they."" (Italy's basic goals were African countries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eek mazboot foj aur bahriyah banana** (Building a strong army and navy) - The passage states Italy's army and navy were *weak*, not that building them was the primary goal.
* **C: Misri jahazon sey chutkara panaa** (Getting rid of Egyptian ships) - While freeing themselves from British holdings *in* Egypt was a necessity to reach their goal, it wasn't the goal itself.
* **D: Bartanavi buniyaadein qayem karna** (Establishing British bases) -  Italy wanted to *remove* British bases, not establish them.



"
Kisney halah aawaron key darmiyaan dostanah talluqaat qayem kiye they?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy Fransisi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""yeah francisi log they jinhon nay 1940 mein germani key saath aman qayem kiya thaa aur hamlah aawaron say ladnay kee bajaye unn key saath mill kirr kam kiya."" This directly translates to ""These French people who established peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.""  These people were the Vichy French.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarmani key log (German people):** The passage states the *French* established relations with Germany, not the other way around.
*   **C: Ameriki log (American people):** The Americans *fought against* the invaders, they did not have friendly relations with them.
*   **D: Aazad farnsisi (Free French):** The Free French actively *fought against* the Germans and Vichy French.



"
Operation Dragoon mein shaamil ittehaadi kon thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ameriki aur aazad fransisi (American and Free French)**.

The passage clearly states: ""Sirf do hafton mein **ameriki aur azad francisi afwaj** nay jonubi france ko azad karaa lia aur woh germani kee taraf rukh karr rahay they."" (In just two weeks, **American and Free French forces** liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vichy Fransisi aur Ameriki (Vichy French and American)** - The passage describes Vichy French as the collaborators *being fought against*, not allies in Operation Dragoon.
*   **C: jarmani key log aur fransisi (German people and French)** - Germany was the enemy in this operation.
*   **D: Ameriki aur jarmani key log (American and German people)** - Germany was the enemy in this operation.



"
Kiss taknik ki taraqqi ki wajah sey aabdozon ney paani key nichey safar karna shuru kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jaise hee radar tayyaar honaa aur ziyadah durust honaa shuroo huwa, aabdozein nazar mein aaney say bachnay key liye paani key neechey jaaney parr majboor hogayein.""  This translates to ""As radar became ready and more accurate, submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U-kashtiyaan (U-boats)** - This refers to *what* the German submarines were called, not the technology that caused them to submerge.
* **B: Shoot karney ki hadd (Firing range)** - This isn't mentioned as a reason for submarines going underwater.
* **C: Gashti (Patrol)** -  Patrols are an activity submarines perform, not a technology that forces a change in behavior.



"
Apney pahley istemaal key doraan kashtiyon mein kiss elaqah mein bahut mahdood range thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Shoot karney** (to shoot/attack).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pisse pusht unki raftaar bahut dheemi thee aur unn key **hamlah karnay dairah** kaafi mahdud thaa.""  This translates to ""...their speed was very slow and their **attack range** was quite limited.""

Therefore, the limited range referred to is specifically related to their ability to *shoot* or attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gasht karney** (patrolling) - While submarines patrol, the passage doesn't say their range *for patrolling* was limited.
*   **B: Safar karney** (traveling) - The passage mentions they could travel on the surface initially, so their travel range wasn't the limitation.
*   **D: Anjaam deney** (to accomplish/execute) - This is too broad and doesn't relate to the specific limitation described in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney moahedah ki khelaaf warzi ki thee? ","The correct answer is **D: Soviet key log** (Soviet people).

The text explicitly states that the Soviet Union violated treaties (like the Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact) by invading Poland's eastern territories. This is clear from the phrase: ""...Soviet Union red army key 800,000 say ziyadah afwaj daakhil hogayi aur reega aman muahidah, soviet- polish adm jaarhiyat muahidah, aur deegar bain alaqwami, dotarfah aur kasiruljahti muahidon kee khelaaf warzi mein poland key mashriqi khitton mein hamlay karnay ke baad..."" which translates to ""...the Soviet Union's Red Army entered with more than 800,000 soldiers, attacking Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties...""



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Surkh foj ney anjaam nahein diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Pul key sirey parr dobarah monazzam honaa (Reorganizing on Polish soil)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Poland was defeated and the *hope* was to regroup in Romania. However, this plan was abandoned when the Soviet Union invaded. This means the Red Army did *not* allow or facilitate a Polish reorganization on Polish soil.
* **The passage confirms the Red Army *did*:**
    * **A: Ukrainian ka front banana (Form the Ukrainian front):**  The passage explicitly mentions the creation of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
    * **B: Mashriqi khitton parr hamlah (Attack the eastern territories):** The passage directly states the Red Army attacked Poland's eastern territories.
    * **D: Eek moahedah ki khelaaf warzi (Violate a treaty):**  The passage specifies violations of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other treaties.

Therefore, the Red Army did not carry out the reorganization of Polish forces on Polish soil."
Itly ki dasvein foj key Engineer-in-Chief key saath keya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Usey bartanavi logon ney giraftaar kiya thaa** (He was arrested by the British).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bardiya key mashriq mein kameen lagaa karr british nay atalvi daswein army key engineer inchief general lastakchi ko giraftar karr lia."" which translates to ""Lying in ambush east of Bardia, the British arrested the engineer-in-chief of the Italian tenth army, General Lastakchi.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fort Capuzzo mein usey giraftaar kiya gaya thaa** (He was arrested in Fort Capuzzo) - While Fort Capuzzo was important, Lastakchi was arrested *near* Bardia, not *in* Capuzzo.
*   **B: Usey Tobruk mein qatal kar diya gaya thaa** (He was killed in Tobruk) - The passage doesn't say he was killed, only arrested.  Marshal Balbo was killed in Tobruk, not Lastakchi.
*   **D: Usey dosti ki aag ney qatal kar diya thaa** (He was killed by friendly fire) - This describes the fate of Marshal Balbo, not General Lastakchi.



"
Italo Balbo ko kahaan qatal kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""28 june ko libya key governor general aur masulini key bazahir waaris marshel atalo balbo, **tabrok** mein landing key doraan dostana firing say halak hogaye they."" (On June 28th, the Governor General of Libya and the apparent heir of Mussolini, Marshal Italo Balbo, was fatally hit by friendly fire **during a landing in Tobruk**.)

Therefore, Italo Balbo was killed in Tobruk.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Konsi darjah zail taknik Tibet key moraqbah ka ahem hissah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yoga ki harakaat mein maharat haasil karna (Mastering yoga postures)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions these techniques as central to Tibetan Buddhism's practices:

*   **Saans leney ki warzishein karnaa (Breathing exercises):** ""...sans kee mashq...""
*   **Mantaron ko dohrana (Repeating mantras):** ""...mantar...""
*   **Dewtaon ko tasavvur mein lana (Visualizing deities):** ""...mukhtalif dewataon key tasavvur...""

However, there's *no mention* of mastering yoga postures (yoga ki harakaat) as a key component of Tibetan meditation. While yoga can be part of Buddhist practice generally, this text focuses on *kundalini yoga*, visualization of deities, breathing exercises, and mantras as the core of Tibetan meditation.

Therefore, yoga postures are the only option not explicitly stated as a key technique in the given passage."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Tibet key moraqbah key “markaz” key doraan chakra kaisey faal huey?","The correct answer is **B: Dewtaon ko tasavvur mein lakar (By visualizing deities)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tibbati moraqabe kaa markazi noqtah devta yuga hay. mukhtalif dewataon key tasavvur say tawanayi key channels saaf hojatay hain, chakkar mutaharrik hojatay hain aur roshan khayal shouoor paida hota hay."" (The central point of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras become active, and luminous consciousness arises.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mukhtalif yoga harakaat key zariyah (Through different yoga movements)** - The text doesn't mention yoga movements as the central point.
*   **C: Mantaron ko dohrana (Repeating mantras)** - Mantras are *part* of the practice, but not the *central* point.
*   **D: Saans leney ki warzishein karnaa (Doing breathing exercises)** - Breathing exercises are also *part* of the practice, but not the *central* point.



"
Program key doraan doosra aqeedat mandanah gaana kisney pesh kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""gulukaar sanju sharma nay shaam kaa aaghaz kiya aur uss key baad jay shankar choudhari nay chhappan bhoj bhajan bhee gaya, gulukaar raju kandhelwal nay uss kaa saath diyaa.""  This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma started the evening and after that Jai Shankar Choudhary also sang the Chhappan Bhoj Bhajan, with Raju Khandelwal accompanying him.""

Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary was the second devotional song performer mentioned.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khana chadhaney key doraan kisney aqeedat mandanah gaana pesh kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakha Singh nay chhappan bhog bhajan bhee gaya."" (Lakha Singh also sang a bhajan during the Chhappan Bhog offering).  Chhappan Bhog *is* the food offering, so he sang a devotional song *during* the offering of food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He sang a bhajan earlier in the program, but not during the Chhappan Bhog offering.
* **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity being offered to, not a singer.
* **D: Sanju Sharma:** He started the program, but didn't sing during the Chhappan Bhog.



"
Shaam ki dusri aakhiri kaar kardagi kiya thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina aur Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Turki sahirah season akso nay atalvi tenor alisandro safinah aur yunani gulukaar haaris aliziyao key saath apnay funn kaa muzahirah kiya.""  This directly translates to: ""Turkish singer Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.""

This was the performance *before* the final act (""Fire of Anatolia""), making it the second to last performance of the evening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Anatolia ki aag (Fire of Anatolia)** - This was the *last* performance.
* **C: Cahkkar laganey waley Dervesh (Whirling Dervishes)** - The passage doesn't mention whirling dervishes.
* **D: Aqeedah Erkoç aur musalmaan Gürses (Aqeedah Erkoç and Musalman Gürses)** - While mentioned earlier in the passage, they weren't the second-to-last performance.
"
Alessandro Safina ki qomiyat kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Italy**.

The text states: ""atalvi tenor **alisandro safinah**"" -  ""atalvi"" means Italian, therefore Alessandro Safina is Italian. 

While the performance included Turkish and Greek artists, Safina himself is identified as Italian within the passage.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaat parr, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Santa Clara mein aag lagi thee** (There was a fire in Santa Clara).

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on heat and a stuck roller coaster.** It mentions the high temperature but *never* states there was a fire.
*   **B: Roller coaster parr log fans gaye thay** (People got stuck on the roller coaster) - This is explicitly stated in the passage (""roller coaster parr kisee bhee waqt phans jaana"").
*   **C: Mosaafiron ko paani diya gaya thaa** (Passengers were given water) - This is the first sentence of the passage.
*   **D: Sawari sey pahley shakhs ko utarney mein kam sey kam 60 minat lagey they** (It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person off the ride) - The passage states ""kam az kam eek ghantah lagaa thaa"" which means ""at least one hour"" or 60 minutes.

Therefore, option A is the only statement *not* supported by the text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bechain kaney waali garmi ki satah key baarey mein kisney tabsarah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Aag ka kaptaan (Fire captain)**.

The passage states: ""Fire captain Scot Konas nay kahaa, """"santa klara mein yeah bahut garam din thaa jab keh temprature 90 key range mein thaa."""" 

This directly translates to ""Fire captain Scot Konas said, """"It was a very hot day in Santa Clara when the temperature was in the 90s."""" 

Therefore, the fire captain commented on the heat level.



"
Sunami ki sargarmi ki wajah sey taaqat ki gair faaliyat kahaan thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Tonga mein koyee badaa noqsan yaa chot kee khabar nahein aayi lekin aarizi tor parr bijli chalee gayee thee..."" which translates to ""...No major damage or injuries were reported in Tonga, but the power went out temporarily..."".  This directly links the tsunami activity to the power outage in Tonga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Niue** - The text mentions activity *near* Niue (Paagoo Paagoo and New Key are near Niue), but doesn't say there was a power outage there.
*   **C: Hawaii key school** - The text mentions schools were closed in the Hawaiian Islands, but this was a *precautionary* measure due to the tsunami warning, not a direct result of power failure *because* of the tsunami.
*   **D: Pago Pago** - The text mentions tsunami activity near Pago Pago, but doesn't link it to a power outage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Tonga parr taaqat ki gair faaliyat ka kaisey asar hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Hukkam motalliqah tanbihaat wosul karney key qaabil nahein thay** (Officials were unable to receive related warnings).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*aarizi tor parr bijli chalee gayee thee, jis key baes mubaiyanah tor parr pi ti dabloo si key zariah jaari honey sonami warning tongayi hukkaam mosul nahein karr paaye.*""  This translates to ""...the electricity went out temporarily, because of which Tongan officials were unable to receive tsunami warnings issued via PTWC (Pacific Tsunami Warning Center).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchh noqsaan ki report mili thee** (Some damage was reported) - The text specifically states ""koyee badaa noqsan yaa chot kee khabar nahein aayi"" (no major damage or injuries were reported).
*   **B: Uthaye gaye tanbihaat key baarey mein hukkam ko khabar nahein mili thee** (Officials did not receive information about the issued warnings) - This is close, but the reason *why* they didn't receive the information is due to the power outage, making D more specific.
*   **C: Samunadar ki satah ki readingein motassir hui theen** (Sea level readings were affected) - The text says sea level readings *indicated* a tsunami, it doesn't say the readings themselves were affected.



"
Jonny Reid ki driving raftaar ka andazah lganey key liye police kabb apni radar banduqein istemaal karney key qaabil theen?,"The correct answer is **C: Jabb wohh 160 kailometer fee ghanta sey ziyadah parr chala raha thaa** (When he was driving over 160 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

The text states the police *had trouble determining* how fast Mr. Red was going *because* Black Beauty was so fast. They were only able to get a reading *when* his speed dropped *to* 160 kilometers per hour.  This implies they could only use their radar guns effectively when he was exceeding that speed initially, but before it dropped to a readable 160 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Jabb wohh 160 kilometer fee ghanta parr chala raha thaa (When he was driving at 160 kilometers per hour) - This is when they *got* a reading, not when they could *use* the guns.
*   **B:** Pul parr uskey satvein baar mein (On his seventh time across the bridge) - The number of times doesn't relate to their ability to read the speed.
*   **D:** Pul parr apney pahli baar mein (On his first time across the bridge) - Again, the specific time doesn't determine when the radar guns were usable.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, New Zealand police key liye Jonny Reid ki raftaar ka andazah lgana mushkil keon thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Car bahut aahistah thee** (The car was very slow).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""New Zealand police ko apni speed radar bandooqon kaa istemaal kartay hoay yeah jaannay mein preshani hoyee keh mister red kitni teezi say chal rehaa hay keunkeh black beauty kitni kam hay...""  This translates to ""New Zealand police had trouble using their speed radar guns to determine how fast Mr. Red was going because Black Beauty was so small."" 

Essentially, the car was *so fast* that the police's radar guns couldn't accurately track its speed.  The passage emphasizes the car's speed by saying he drove over 160 km/h *seven times*.  ""Aahistah"" (slow) is the opposite of what's happening, but it reflects the police's *perception* that the car's speed was undetectable because it was exceeding their instruments' capabilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh 160 kailometer fee ghanta key taht chala raha thaa** (He was driving under 160 kilometers per hour) - The passage says he *exceeded* 160 km/h.
*   **C: Usney sirf pul parr saat baar chalaya thaa** (He only drove on the bridge seven times) - The number of times he drove on the bridge doesn't explain the difficulty in measuring his speed.
*   **D: Auckland Harbour pul bahut puraana thaa** (Auckland Harbour bridge was very old) - The age of the bridge is irrelevant to the issue of measuring speed.



"
Butte key talluq sey zalzalah ka markaz kahaan thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 meel jonub** (40 miles south).

The text states: ""...aur beaut say taqriban 65 kilometer (40 meel) jonub thaa."" which translates to ""...and approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Butte.""
"
Abu Ghraib mein fasaad key doraan kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Qaidiyon ki badsoluki (Ill-treatment of prisoners)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the jail became infamous *after* abuses of prisoners were discovered following the American forces taking control. While the fire (D) is mentioned, it's a consequence of the situation, not the core issue that made the jail infamous. The passage focuses on the *reason* for the bad reputation, which was the mistreatment of prisoners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tala bandi (Lockdown)** - While likely a part of the jail's operation, it's not what caused the notoriety.
*   **C: Ameriki fojon ney control sanbhaal liya thaa (American forces took control)** - This is a fact mentioned in the passage, but not the *reason* for the jail’s infamy.
*   **D: Jail mein aag laga di gayi thee (The jail was set on fire)** - The fire happened *during* the unrest, but the unrest was triggered by the abuse.



"
Iraqi jail ko badnami keon mili thee? ,"The correct answer is **D: Qaidi ki badsoluki ki daryaaft** (Discovery of mistreatment of prisoners).

Here's why:

The passage states the jail became infamous *after* mistreatment of prisoners was discovered following the American forces taking control. While there was unrest (fasadaat) and the fire, those were events *leading to* the discovery of the mistreatment, not the reason for the bad reputation itself.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ismein aag laga di gayi thee** (It was set on fire) - The fire happened, but it wasn’t *why* the jail became notorious.
* **B: Ameriki fojon ney control ley liya thaa** (American forces took control) -  Taking control was a precursor to the discovery of the abuse.
* **C: Motaddid fasadaat huey thay** (There were continuous riots) - Riots were part of the context, but not the core reason for the jail's infamy.



"
Maui key jang key yaadgari Stadium mein kis qism ki taqreeb muaqid honi thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Mahfil**

Here's why:

The text says the show was for 9,000 people to *participate* in (shirkat karna). This implies an event for entertainment or gathering, which best fits the term ""mahfil"" (gathering/event). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jadu ka show (Magic show):** The text doesn't mention magic.
*   **B: Football match:**  A football match wouldn't typically be described as having people ""participate"" in it in this way. It's more of a spectator sport.
*   **D: Fund ekattha karney waali (Fundraising event):** While possible, the text doesn't explicitly state this. The focus is on the number of attendees.



"
Taqreeb ki mansukhi key baarey mein kisney aakhir kar wazahat faraham ki thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Band ki bast company**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Bands kee intezami company, ech key mangement incorporation, nay koyee ibtadayi wajah nahein batayi... magar unhon nay aglay din tak mantiqi wajuhaat ko elzaam diyaa."" This means the band's management company ultimately provided the explanation for the cancellation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Band** - The text says the *company* explained, not the band directly.
*   **C: Jang key yaadgari Stadium ka maalik** - The stadium owner isn't mentioned as having provided any explanation.
*   **D: Maddah** - The text mentions the band apologizing *to* the audience, but not that the audience explained the cancellation.



"
Bishkek key motaddid bashindagaan key khiyaal mein loot karney ka kon zimmah daar thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mozahereen (Protesters)**.

The text states: ""Bashkeek key mutaddid shahriyon nay iss laqanoniyat keliye jonub key muzahireen ko zimmah daar thehraya hay.""  This translates to: ""Many citizens of Bishkek blamed the southern protesters for this lawlessness.""

Therefore, the citizens of Bishkek believed the protesters were responsible for the looting."
Jonub key mozahereen parr loot karney ka kisney ilzaam lagaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek key bashindagaan** (Residents of Bishkek).

The text states: ""Bashkeek key mutaddid shahriyon nay iss laqanoniyat keliye jonub key muzahireen ko zimmah daar thehraya hay."" This directly translates to ""Numerous citizens of Bishkek blamed the southern protesters for this lawlessness.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qanoon nafiz karney waley afsaraan (Law enforcement officers):** The text says they *weren't* present, so they couldn't have laid the blame.
* **C: Inteshaar pasand (A spreader/promoter - doesn't fit the context):** The text doesn't mention anyone specifically spreading the blame, just that citizens did.
* **D: Logon key giroh (Crowd of people):** While citizens are a group of people, the text specifies *numerous citizens* (mutaddid shahriyon), making ""residents"" a more accurate translation.



"
Ring mein badhi hui kharidon ka tajarbah kabb hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: QVC parr zaahir honay key baad**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""2017 key aakhir mein saminof khareed wo farokht key tea wee channel **que wee see** parr haazir hoay. Ring nay musabiq security company adt corporation key saath apnay qanuni daway kaa tasviah bhee karr lia.""  This directly translates to ""In late 2017 Saminof bought and appeared on the sale TV channel **QVC**. Ring also settled its legal claim with competitive security company ADT Corporation.""

The passage specifically links the appearance on QVC with increased sales (""farokht"" meaning sales).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shark Tank parr zahir honay key baad:** While *Shark Tank* brought some attention, the passage states the panel *denied* funding, implying it wasn't a direct boost in sales at that time.
*   **B: 2013 mein fund mahfooz karney key baad:**  The passage states they *didn't* secure funding in 2013.
*   **D: ADT key saath moqddamah qayem karney key baad:**  Settling the legal claim with ADT is mentioned, but not connected to increased sales.



"
Jamie Siminoff ney Ring shurru karney ka kabb faisalah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Apneu darwazah ki ghanti ko nakaafi samajhney key baad** (After finding his doorbell insufficient).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iss say qabal ring key ci ei ow jaimi saminaaf nay tabsarah kiya thaa keh company uss waqat shuroo kee gayee thee jab inn key darwazay kee ghanti inn kee dukaan say gairege mein nahein sunayi deti thee."" 

This translates to: ""Before Ring, Jamie Siminoff mentioned that the company started when their doorbell wasn't audible from the shop.""  This clearly indicates the company was founded *because* he found his existing doorbell inadequate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eek nakaam Shark Tank key zohoor key baad** (After a failed Shark Tank appearance) - While the Shark Tank appearance is mentioned, it happened *after* the company was started, not before.
* **C: Fund mahfooz karney key baad** (After securing funds) -  The passage states they were *denied* funding on Shark Tank, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Eek kaamiyab QVC zohoor key baad** (After a successful QVC appearance) - The QVC appearance happened later in the company's history.



"
Motaleaah key qose qazah key har episode mein kiss cheez keliye bachon ki sifarishaat ki pesh kash thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Kitabein (Books)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harr programme unn kitaabon kee sifarish bhee karta hay jinhein bachon ko library mein jaatay waqt talaash karnaa chahiye.""  This directly translates to ""Each program also recommends books that children should search for when going to the library.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Television show:** The show *features* books, but doesn't recommend the show itself.
* **B: Maqami librariyaan (Local librarians):** While children are encouraged to go to the library, the show directly recommends *books* to find there.
* **C: Khiyaliye (Imagination):** The show uses stories to explore ideas, but the direct recommendation is for books.



"
Motaleaah key qose qazah key silsiley ki mansukhi mein kis sey taawun mila hoga?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakaafi fund haasil karnaa (Insufficient funding)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baaz log basohmool john grant key iss key qayel hain keh **funding kaa fuqdan** aur educational tea wee programming key falsafah kaa taqllub donon nay iss series key inqetaa mein hissah lia.""  (Some people believe, along with John Grant, that **lack of funding** and a shift in the philosophy of educational TV programming both contributed to the series' cancellation.)

The question asks what *contributed* to the cancellation of the reading series. The passage directly links insufficient funding as a key factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emmy inamaat ki kami (Lack of Emmy awards):**  The passage doesn't mention Emmy awards.
* **C: John Grant ka nazariyah (John Grant's theory):** While John Grant is mentioned, the passage says some *agree* with his assessment *including* lack of funding, it doesn't say his theory alone caused the cancellation.
* **D: Janaab Rogers key pados ki kamiyabi (Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood's success):** The passage mentions *Sesame Street* and *Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood* as comparisons for the show's duration, but doesn’t link their success to the show’s cancellation.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon darakht key baarey mein Amsterdam aur museum keliye afsaraan ney dalil de thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Yeah awaami sehat keliye khatrah hay** (It is a threat to public health).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Amsterdam and the museum officials said the fungus on the tree ""posed a threat to public health"" (sehate aammah kos khatra lahiq ho gayaa hay).  This is the direct reason they wanted to cut it down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeah naguzer tor parr gir jaye gaa** (It will fall down imminently) - While they *claimed* it was close to falling, the threat to public health was the main argument.
*   **B: Isko mahfooz hona chahiye** (It should be protected) - This is the opposite of what they were arguing.
*   **C: Yeah fungus sey aaludah hay** (It is infected with fungus) - This is a *fact* about the tree, but not the *reason* they gave for wanting to cut it down. They said the fungus created a health hazard.



"
"RSPCA key liye eek chief tahqiq kaar key motabiq, tahqiqaat ko darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye meyaari hona chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camerey**.

Here's why:

The passage states the RSPCA (and Animal Liberation) are demanding CCTV cameras be *installed in all slaughterhouses*.  The chief inspector states CCTV will ""signal to people who work with animals that animal welfare is a priority.""  This directly links the importance of CCTV to improved standards and monitoring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Janwaron key saath kaam krney waala koyi shakhs (Someone who works with animals):** While the inspector mentions people working with animals, the focus isn't on *them* being the standard, but on the CCTV cameras influencing their behavior.
* **C: Nigraani ki tansibaat (Monitoring organizations):** The passage discusses the *implementation* of monitoring (via CCTV), not the organizations themselves being the standard.
* **D: Mazbah khaney (Slaughterhouses):** The slaughterhouses are the *location* of the standard (CCTV installation), not the standard itself.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Australia key mazbah khanah key molazmeen keliye janwar ki bhalayi ki ahmiyat ko kiya thos bana sakti hay?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camerey ki tansib (Installation of CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the installation of CCTV cameras will ""signal to individuals working with animals that animal welfare is a priority.""  This directly demonstrates how it strengthens the importance of animal welfare for those working in slaughterhouses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: RSPCA key saath zaruri mulaqaatein (Mandatory meetings with RSPCA):** While the RSPCA is advocating for the cameras, the passage doesn't say meetings are the mechanism for reinforcing welfare.
* **C: Baqaedah mazbah khanah ki taftishaat (Regular slaughterhouse inspections):** Inspections are mentioned as a result of the monitoring, but the *cameras themselves* are what signal the priority.
* **D: ABC sey nigraani (Monitoring by ABC):** ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) is just the news outlet reporting on the story – they don't enforce welfare standards.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Giraftaar shakhs ka peshah kiya hay?","The correct answer is **A: Talib ilm (Student)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...molawwis eek aur **talib ilm** ko 21 march ko giraftar karr lia gayaa hay.""  This directly translates to ""...a cleric and a **student** were arrested on March 21st.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Minneapolis Star-Tribune key saath eek sayyaah (A tourist with the Minneapolis Star-Tribune):** The passage mentions the Star Tribune as a source of information, but the arrested individual isn't a journalist.
* **C: Qabaili sarbaraah (Tribal Chief):** While the passage *mentions* the tribal chairman (Flayed Jorden) is the father of the arrested person, the arrested person *is not* the chief.
* **D: Surkh jheel mein eek haakim (A ruler in Red Lake):** The passage doesn't indicate the arrested individual holds any position of authority.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jabb deegar giraftaari key baarey mein khabar fail rahi thee, to kitney motassireen ki akhiri rosumaat munaqid ki jaa rahi tee?","The correct answer is **B: Teen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jaif vice aur unn **nau mazlumin mein say teenon** kee aakhri rosumaat kee adayegi ke waqt..."" which translates to ""...Jaif Vice and three of those nine victims were having their final rites performed at the time...""

Therefore, the final rites for three victims were being conducted when the news of the arrest spread."
"Mozahiron key jawaab mein, konsa mulk apney dastakhat shudah ACTA moahedah key saath aagey nahein badha thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pichlay maah poland mein uss waqt bhaari ehtejaj huwa jab uss mulk nay ACTA parr dastakhat kiyey jis say police sarkaar ko sare dast muahidah kee tausiq ko mowajjal karnaa padaa."" This means Poland *did* initially sign ACTA, but heavy protests forced the government to postpone its ratification (moving forward with the agreement).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Germany:** The text states protests *happened in* Germany, but doesn't say they stopped the agreement.
*   **C: Scotland:** Protests occurred *in* Scotland, but it's part of the UK and the text doesn't mention the UK halting the agreement.
*   **D: Lithuania:** Protests occurred in Lithuania, but the text doesn't mention Lithuania halting the agreement.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail mulk ney ACTA mein shaamil honey key marhalah sey ikhtelaaf karney ka faisalah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""Latvia aur silwakiya donon nay acta mein shomooliyat key amal mein takhir kee hay."" (Latvia and Slovakia both delayed the implementation of joining ACTA.)

This means Latvia decided to postpone joining ACTA, indicating disagreement with the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia:** The text mentions protests in Estonia (Teelan) but doesn't state they delayed joining ACTA.
*   **B: Lithuania:** The text mentions protests in Lithuania (Vilivence) but doesn't state they delayed joining ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland:** The text mentions protests in Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow) but doesn't relate it to ACTA joining.



"
iPod key ziyadah garma honay key hadsaat key natijah mein kitney log zakhmi huey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...chaar log thoday jalay"" which translates to ""...four people were slightly burned."" This directly answers the question about the number of people injured due to the overheating iPods.



"
Kisney kaha thaa kehh ziyadah garam honey key hadsaat bahut sanjeedah nahein thay?,"The correct answer is **D: Seeb** (Apple).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pichlay haftay, em ayee tea aayi nay elaan kiya keh apple nay usay overheating yani ziyadah garmi key 34 waaqiaat say aagah kiya thaa, jisay company nay """"gair sanjidah"""" qaraar diyaa.""  

This translates to: ""Last week, EMTI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 cases of overheating, which the company termed as 'not serious'.""

Therefore, **Apple (Seeb)** is the one who called the overheating incidents ""not serious"".



"
"Apni taqreer key doraan, Steve Jobs ney kiya kahaa thaa kehh Apple dobarah ijaad karney jaa rahaa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""aaj apple nay **phone** ko dobarah nawabad kiya hay, aaj ham eek tareekh raqam karnay jaa rahay hain-"" which translates to ""today Apple has reinvented the **phone**, today we are going to make history.""

The question asks what he said Apple was going to reinvent. Therefore, the answer is ""phone"".



"
Steve Jobs ki do ghantah ki taqreer ka maqsad kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek naya phone launch karnaa** (To launch a new phone).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Steve Jobs unveiled a device *after* taking an iPhone out of his pocket. He also said, ""today Apple has reinvented the phone..."" This clearly indicates the purpose of his two-hour speech was to launch a new phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek naya tablet launch karnaa** (To launch a new tablet) - The passage focuses on a phone, not a tablet.
*   **B: Eek naya computer launch karnaa** (To launch a new computer) - The passage focuses on a phone, not a computer.
*   **D: Apney retire honay ka elaan karnaa** (To announce his retirement) - The passage describes a product launch, not a retirement announcement.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ney Argentinaa key cenima hall mein kiya elaan kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Apni sadarti ummidwari (Her presidential candidacy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maujudah senitor aur argentine kee khaatune awwal christina fernandeez dee kirchner nay guzashta shaam ko law plata, ju beunce ires say 50 kelometer door (31 meel) eek shahar hay, us mein apni sadarati ummidwariyat kaa elaan kardiya.""  This directly translates to: ""Current senator and former first lady of Argentina Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Senate key liye ladney ka apna iraadah (Her intention to fight for the Senate):** While she *did* launch a Senate campaign from the theater in 2005, the passage explicitly states she announced her *presidential* candidacy in La Plata.
* **C: Buenos Aires subey key wafad key liye apni muhim (Her campaign for the Buenos Aires province delegation):** The passage mentions her being part of the delegation in 2005, but not that she announced a campaign *for* the delegation itself.
* **D: Mojudah senator key tor parr apney istefaa deney ka mansubah (Her intention to resign as a current senator):** The passage doesn't mention anything about resignation.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ney ladney key paney iraadah ka kahaan elaan kiyaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Buenos Aires sey 31 meel door Argentinaa key Theatre mein**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mrs. Kachner nay sadarat key liye khadi honey kaa elaan argentine theater say kiya."" (Mrs. Kirchner announced her presidential candidacy from the Argentina Theater.)
* **It also states:** ""law plata, ju beunce ires say 50 kelometer door (31 meel) eek shahar hay"" (La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires).

Therefore, the theater is in Argentina and 31 miles from Buenos Aires.



"
Baday bhai key hawaley sey ACMA ki taqiqaat kiya theen?,"The correct answer is **A: Censorship key qanoon ki khelaaf warzi nahein ki gayi thee** (No violation of censorship law).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""internet parr video ko nashar kiye jaaney key bawajood, big baradar nay online mashmulat kee censorship key qawanin kee khelaaf warzi nahein kee thee"" (despite the video being published on the internet, Big Brother did not violate the censorship laws).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Media ko baday bhai ki website parr zakhirah kardah paya gaya thaa** (Media was found stored on Big Brother's website) - The passage states the *opposite* - the file wasn't stored on Big Brother's website.
* **C: Censorship key qanoon ki khelaaf warzi ki gayi thee** (A violation of censorship law occurred) - This directly contradicts the passage.
* **D: Mashmool ko jimsaani tor parr server parr sokunat karta hua paya gaya thaa** (The content was found physically residing on a server) -  The passage explains that physical storage on a server is *required* for the broadcasting act to apply, but doesn't say the content *was* found there. It emphasizes the lack of physical storage is *why* there was no violation.



"
Internet ka mashmool samjh jaaney key liye media ko kinn parameters key taht hona chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Isko jismani tor parr server parr rehaayesh pazeer honaa zaruri hay** (It is necessary for it to physically reside on a server).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...internet key mashmulat shumaar kiye jaaney key liye usay jismani tor say kisee server parr honaa chahiye."" ( ...for internet content to be counted, it must physically be on a server).  This means physical storage on a server is the defining parameter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isko internet parr stream hona lazmi hay** (It is necessary for it to stream on the internet) - Streaming doesn't necessarily mean it's *stored* on a server under the control of the entity being investigated.
* **C: Isey kisi website parr zakhirah nahein kiya ja sakta** (It cannot be saved on any website) - The passage actually explains why the ""big brother"" wasn't at fault - because the file *wasn't* saved on their website.  This is the opposite of the requirement.
* **D: Isy ICMA ki jaanib sey manzoori milnaa zaruri hay** (It is necessary to get approval from ICMA) - The passage doesn't mention any need for approval from ICMA.



"
Australia ki Liberal Party ka leader kon hay?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The passage states: ""...wazir aazam **John Howard** key jaan nasheen bannay key bahut ziyadah imkaan hain..."" ( ""...there is a very high chance of **John Howard**'s successor becoming...""). This clearly identifies John Howard as the current leader.

While Peter Costello is *likely* to *become* the leader, he isn't the leader *currently*.



"
Australia key paas pahley sey eek nuclear power sanaat keon nahein hay?,"The most logical answer, based on the provided text, is **B: Bahut ziyadah motanazaa (Too controversial)**.

Here's why:

* **The text highlights Peter Costello's *advocacy* for nuclear power.** He says Australia *should* consider it when it becomes commercially viable and states there are ""no principled objections"" to nuclear power. This implies a pre-existing debate and controversy surrounding nuclear power in Australia.  If it wasn't controversial, there wouldn't be a need for him to explicitly state there are ""no principled objections.""
* **The text doesn't offer information directly supporting A, C, or D.** While cost and safety *could* be factors, the passage doesn't mention them. There is no mention of a lack of public support either.



Therefore, the passage strongly suggests the main reason Australia doesn't have a nuclear power industry is because it’s a contentious issue."
Kis skier ney eek rahnuma ki madad sey moqabilah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

The text states: ""Poland key basri mazuri waale scare missiage kareezal aur guide **ainaa ogaranksa** nay super ji mein teerhawein position parr khatam kiya."" This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel competed *with a guide* (Ainaa Ogarzynska).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - Competed in the men's sitting super-G, no guide mentioned.
*   **C: Maciej Krezel** - While he competed, the text specifically names Ainaa Ogarzynska as his guide.



"
Kiss mulk ney khawateen key khada honey key darjah key liye Super-G mein daswaan mokammal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The text states: ""...Netherlands ko kul super jee mein womens standing cliss mein nawwaan maqaam haasil karnay waale ainaa jakamsan aur usee muqabilah mein daswaan maqaam haasil karnay waali finland kee katja sarinan key saath shaamil kiya.""  This translates to: ""...Netherlands included Ainaa Jakamsan who achieved ninth place in the overall Super-G in the women's standing class, and against her, Katja Saranin of Finland achieved tenth place.""

Therefore, the Netherlands achieved tenth place in the women's standing class Super-G."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Balke key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Usney hamlah ka eteraaf kar liya thaa** (He confessed to the attack).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Pesh karnay waala, jisay jaye waquah say giraftar kiya gayaa thaa, uss nay uss hamlay kee tardid kee**"" which translates to ""The defendant, who was arrested at the scene, *denied* the attack.""  He did *not* confess.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Wohh manzar parr giraftaar kar liya gaya thaa** (He was arrested at the scene) - The passage states, ""jisay jaye waquah say giraftar kiya gayaa thaa"" (who was arrested at the scene).
*   **C: Hamlah key doraan usney eek pole ka istemaal kiya thaa** (He used a pole during the attack) -  The passage states, ""us ne pool kaa istemaal tees afraad kee taraf say uss kee taraf phainki jaa rahee botalon say khud ko bachanay key liye kiya thaa"" (he used a pole to defend himself from bottles being thrown by thirty people).
*   **D: Uska dawaa thaa kehh uskey ooper botalein fenki gayi theen** (His claim was that bottles were thrown at him) - This is directly stated in the passage as mentioned above.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiya Blake key saath waqea nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Uss parr eek pole sey hamlah hua thaa (He was attacked with a pole)**.

Here's why:

The text states Blake *claimed* he used the pool cue (which could be translated as ""pole"") to *defend himself* from bottles being thrown at him by thirty people. It doesn't say he *was* attacked with a pole, only that he says he used it for defense.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Wohh insaaf key bigaad key liye mujrim paya gaya thaa (He was found guilty of perverting justice):** The text states he was ""also accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice."" While it doesn't explicitly say ""found guilty,"" the judge's statement about imprisonment being ""almost inevitable"" strongly suggests this.
*   **B: Usey giraftaar kar liya gaya (He was arrested):** The text explicitly states, ""jisay jaye waquah say giraftar kiya gayaa thaa"" (who was arrested at the scene).
*   **D: Usko bata diya gaya thaa kehh usey jail bhejey jaaney ka imkaan hay (He was told he was likely to be sent to jail):** The judge told Blake that being sent to jail was ""almost inevitable.""



"
U.N. ka aalami tapish ka fund kiskey liye istemaal nahein hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Faslon mein tanawwo karnaa (Diversifying crops)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the fund will be used for:

*   Flood-proof housing (Sailaab sey tahaffuz waley makanaat)
*   Improved water supply systems (aab rasaani key behatar nizam)
*   Crop **development** (faslon kee tanviee parr sarf kee jaye gee) - *not* diversification.

Diversifying crops (faslon mein tanawwo karnaa) isn't specifically mentioned as a use for the fund.  The fund focuses on *improving* existing crops, not necessarily growing a wider variety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mamalik ko taraqqi deney key liye taknik lanaa (Bringing technology to help countries develop)** - The passage mentions sharing technologies with developing countries *generally*, but doesn't state the fund will be used for this.
*   **C: Sailaab sey tahaffuz waley makanaat (Flood-proof housing)** - The passage explicitly says the fund will be used for this.
*   **D: Alami tapish key asaraat mein takhfif karnaa (Mitigating the effects of global warming)** - This is the overall goal, and all the listed uses of the fund contribute to this, making it too broad to be the *thing it won't be used for*.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, U.N. ko keya mahfooz karney ki ummid hay?","The correct answer is **A: Paisah, Taknik key ishteraak key zariyah** (Money, through the sharing of technology).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aqwam muttahedah bhee ummid karta hay global warming say mutissirah momalik kee madad key liye eek fund ko hatmi shakal dena chahiye...aur kam aaludgi key tareeqe say taraqqi karnay keliye taraqqi pazeer momalik key saath technologies kaa ishteraak karnay kaa mauzu shaamil kiya gayaa.""

This translates to: ""The United Nations also hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming...and the topic of sharing technologies with developing countries to progress in a less polluting way was included.""

Therefore, the U.N. hopes to secure funding *and* share technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Faslein (Crops)** - While the passage mentions investing in crop improvement, it isn't what the UN *hopes to secure*.
*   **C: Baaqi baarish key jangalaat (Remaining rainforests)** - Rainforest preservation is *part of the agenda*, but not what the UN specifically hopes to secure.
*   **D: Kharaab paani key bando bast sey log motassir ho gaye (People affected by settlements of bad water)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Albert Muchanga ney kisi aisi cheez key tor parr hawalah nahein diya thaa jiss parr abb bhi ittefaaq karney ki zarurat hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Aya Benin AfCTA mein shaamil hogaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states Albert Muchanga *announced* Benin's inclusion in AfCFTA. He didn't mention it as something still needing agreement. He clearly stated Benin *is* joining.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jis tarikh ko tejaarat shuru ho sakti hay** - He specifically mentioned 1 July 2020 as the potential start date.
* **C: Asal qawayed** - He directly said they haven't agreed on ""asli qanoon"" (core rules).
* **D: Tariff ki reaayatein** - He said they haven't agreed on ""mahsoolat kee moraat"" (tariff concessions/moratoriums).

Therefore, the only option that Albert Muchanga *didn't* present as something still under negotiation is Benin's membership.



"
Ebarat key hisaab sey tejarat July mein keon shuru ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Maqaam mein qawayed aur reaayaton ka kaafi framework hota hay** (There is a sufficient framework of rules and tariffs in place).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Commissioner nay kahaa, """"ham abhi tak asl qanoon aur mahsulaat kee moraat parr muttafiq nahein hoay hain, lekin jo bunyaadi dhancha hamare paas mojud hay woh 1 july 2020 say tejarat shuroo karnay keliye kaafi hay"""".""  This directly translates to ""The Commissioner said, 'We haven't yet agreed on the actual laws and tariffs, but the basic framework we have is sufficient to start trade from 1 July 2020.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Nigeria *intends* to join, the passage doesn't say July is a condition *of* joining. It says trade can *start* in July.
* **C:** The AU Commissioner simply stated the situation; he didn't explain *why* trade could start.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states they *haven't* agreed on the final rules and tariffs.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Atlanta Journal-ka dastur taleemi afsaraan parr kis cheez ka ilzaam lagay thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Suraagh shudah andruni masail key tor parr kaam na karna (Failing to act on discovered internal issues)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report revealed ""test key scores mein gair mamuli raftaar say izaafe"" (unusually rapid increases in test scores) and alleged that ""androoni satah parr school ko masail kaa idraak ho chukaa thaa taham unhon nay unn hqaieq parr kisee qism kee karrarwai nahein kee"" (the school was aware of the issues internally but took no action on those facts).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Journal-dastur ki report key saath ched chaad karnaa (Tampering with the Journal's report):** The report *revealed* issues, it didn't say the Journal tampered with it.
*   **B: Shahri taleem ki ikhteraa karney mein nakaam hona (Failing to invent urban education):** The passage focuses on test score manipulation, not a failure to create urban education.
*   **D: Kam jaanch key score ki report karnaa (Reporting low test scores):** The report showed unusually *high* scores due to manipulation.

Therefore, the Journal-Constitution accused the educational officials of knowing about problems with the test scores internally and failing to do anything about them.



"
"Ebarat mein di gayi maalumaat ki buniyaad parr, Atlanta Journal-key dastur ki report mein kiya mazkoor nahein thaa?","The correct answer is **C: 2013 ka saal ka qomi Superintendent jeetney waala**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the person won the National Superintendent of the Year award in 2009**, not 2013. It doesn’t mention winning the award *in* 2013.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gair mamuli jaanch key score ki behtari** – The passage explicitly mentions the report revealed an ""unusual rate of increase"" in test scores.
*   **B: Yeah shahadat kehh jaanch key kaghzaat key saath ched chaad ki gayi thee** – The passage states witnesses later revealed that the person ""altered test papers,"" which means there was tampering.
*   **D: Shahri taleem ki ikhteraa karney ki tajaaveez** – The passage states the person ""became known for pioneering urban education.""



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bab baari key baad kiya malumaat mashhoor thee?","The correct answer is **C: Aya ezaafi bam shaamil honay thay** (Were there additional bombs involved).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Do ghanton key darmiyan sarkari emaraton key qareeb mazeed teen bom dhamakay hoay."" (Within two hours, three more explosions occurred near government buildings.)

This directly answers the question of whether additional bombs were involved *after* the first explosion mentioned (""Eek bom governor general key daftar key baahar phataa"" - One bomb exploded outside the Governor General's office).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akhiri zakhm ka shumaar** (Final injury count) - The passage says the *confirmed* number is 30, but the *final* number is still unknown.
* **B: KInn imaaraton key paas bam phatey thay** (Near which buildings did the bombs explode?) - It only says ""near government buildings"" - it doesn't specify *which* buildings.
* **D: Maut ki sarkaari tadaad** (Official death toll) - The passage mentions reports of 8 deaths but confirms the official report states 30 injured, and the *final* death toll is unknown.



"
"2017 mein Manchester shahar sey judney key baad sey, Jesus ney kitney match kheley thay?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Uss waqt say, yeah brazili khiladi tamaam muqabilon mein club keliye 53 match khel chukay hain..."" which translates to ""Since then, this Brazilian player has played 53 matches for the club in all competitions...""
"
Kiss club sey judney key liye Jesus ney £27 million fees wosul ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The passage states: ""21 salah eisaa brazili club palmyras say 27 million dollar kee mubayyanah fees key ewaz guzashta saal januari 2017 mein manchester city mein shaamil ho gaye they."" This translates to: ""Gabriel Jesus joined Manchester City in January 2017 for a transfer fee of $27 million from the Brazilian club Palmeiras.""

Therefore, Jesus received the £27 million fee *from* Palmeiras when he joined Manchester City."
Hostel key mehmaanon key liye konsa bayaan sahi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Aksar mehmaan moqaddas shahar sey thay** (Most of the guests were from the holy city).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *most* of the hostel guests were from the **United Arab Emirates**, not the holy city of Makkah. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Mehmaan hajj key liye Makkah mein thay** (The guests were in Makkah for Hajj) - The passage explicitly states they were there ""on the occasion of the Hajj pilgrimage.""
*   **B: Kuchh mehmaan maqami shahri nahein thay** (Some guests were not local citizens) -  Since they were from the UAE, they were not local to Makkah.
*   **C: Hajj sey pahli raat tak mehmaan mojud thay** (Guests were present until the night before Hajj) - The incident happened *during* Hajj, implying they were there before the pilgrimage began.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi hay?","The correct answer is **C: Hajj ki ziyarat ki pahli raat tak mehmaan mojud thay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hajj kee ziyarat key moqaa parr uss emarat mein mutaddid aazmeen hajj moqeem they..."" which translates to ""At the time of the Hajj pilgrimage, many aspiring pilgrims were present in that building..."" This implies they were there *during* the Hajj pilgrimage, meaning they were present at least on the first night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koyi halakatein nahein hui theen** (No accidents happened) - The passage explicitly states a hostel collapsed, a very serious accident.
* **B: Tamaam mehmaan muttahedah arab imaraat sey thay** (All guests were from the United Arab Emirates) - The passage says *most* guests were from the UAE, not all.
* **D: Aksar mehmaan Makkah key maqami thay** (Most guests were locals of Makkah) - The passage specifically states the guests were *pilgrims* who came to Makkah for Hajj, implying they are not locals.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, tasaadum key baarey mein konsi malumaat yaqini nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Zameen parr tasaadum ka asar** (The impact on the ground).

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists are *still trying to determine* how the collision will affect the ground (""...woh log abb bhee iss baat kaa tayyun karnay kee koshish karr rahay hain yeah takkar kitni tez thee aur iss key zameen parr kiss tarah asar hoga.""). This means the impact on the ground is *not yet known*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tasaadum ki size** (Collision size) - The passage states the collision was a ""very big explosion"", implying a significant size.
*   **B: Tasaadum ki jagah** (Collision location) -  The passage clearly states the collision happened in space, 491 miles above the earth.
*   **D: Khandaraat ki jagah** (Debris location) - US Strategic Command is actively searching for debris. This means they are trying to *find* the location, not that it's unknown.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tasadum key baarey mein kis cheez ko motayyan hona zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **D: Takkar ka durust paimanah (The exact scale of the collision)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*woh log abb bhee iss baat kaa tayyun karnay kee koshish karr rahay hain yeah takkar kitni tez thee aur iss key zameen parr kiss tarah asar hoga.*"" (They are still trying to determine how fast the collision was and how it will affect the ground).  

This directly translates to needing to determine the *scale* or magnitude of the collision.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khandaraat ki suraagh rasani ko kaun sanbhale gaa (Who will handle the debris tracking)** - While debris tracking *is* mentioned (US Strategic Command is looking for debris), the passage doesn't state this is what needs to be *determined*.
*   **B: Tasadum key waqt satellites kitni tezi sey safar kar rahi theen (How fast were the satellites traveling at the time of the collision)** - The passage mentions the speed of the satellites *before* the collision, but determining the speed *at the moment of impact* is part of understanding the collision's scale.
*   **C: Kaisy saazish key tajziyaati natayej ka ishteraak kiya jaaye gaa (How will the conspiracy analysis results be shared)** -  This refers to *after* the investigation, how information will be released, not what needs to be found out.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Batten ney maldaar tareen amerikiyon ki fihrist mein kabhi konsey maqaam ka haamil thaa?","The correct answer is **C: 190vein**.

The passage states: ""Beaton 2008 key 400 ameer tareen amerikiyon kee fehrist mein 190 number parr thaa..."" which translates to ""Beaton was ranked 190th on the list of 400 richest Americans in 2008..."""
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Batten ney atiyah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Virginia ki University**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""woh 1950 mein university of verjiniya key college of arts and sciences say faarig huwa aur uss idaarah key mamtaz atiyah dehindgan mein say eek thaa.""  This directly translates to: ""He graduated from the University of Virginia's College of Arts and Sciences and was one of the distinguished alumni of that institution."" 

Therefore, Beaton gave back to (or was a distinguished alumnus of) the University of Virginia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maldaar tareen amerikiyon ki fihrist (List of the wealthiest Americans):**  The passage states he *was on* the list, not that he donated *to* the list.
*   **C: Edaaron ki ahem tadaad (Important number of institutions):** The passage doesn’t mention donating to multiple institutions.
*   **D: Fonun aur science key liye waqf Colleges (Colleges endowed for arts and sciences):** While he graduated from an arts and sciences college, the passage doesn't say he *endowed* it.



"
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ki dastakhat shudah bill ka kiya cheez hissah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: California key baahar nabalighon ko pur tashaddud video games ki frokht yaa kerayah parr pabandi.**

Here's why:

The passage states the bill *within* California requires labeling and fines for selling violent games to minors. It doesn't mention any restrictions on sales *outside* of California. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Purey California mein nabalighon ko pur tashaddud video games ki frokht yaa kerayah parr pabandi** - This is *part* of what the bill does, it restricts sales to minors *through* labeling and fines, effectively making it harder to sell to them.
* **B: Mujrimon key liye maliyaati fine** - The passage explicitly states a $1000 fine for violations.
* **D: Pur tashaddud games parr baaza zaruriyaat** - The ""18"" label is a labeling requirement (a type of market requirement).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss sey kahi janey waali batein choot gayi theen","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...main waaqaee nahein sun paya keh woh kiya kah rahaa thaa"" - meaning ""I really didn't hear what he was saying.""  This clearly indicates Miller missed hearing something someone said. The context is that Mike was talking *during* the meeting, and Miller was preparing for something else.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duvall key bachey (Duvall's children):** The passage mentions the children were *affected* by the situation but doesn't say they said something Miller missed.
*   **B: Mike:** Mike *said* something, but it was Miller who didn't *hear* it.
*   **D: Duvall:** Duvall is mentioned in relation to the children, but not as the person speaking that Miller failed to hear.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sunaney parr Miller key tajarbah key baarey mein darjah zail mein sey kiya sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Duvall ki kahani parr wohh gahri tawajjoh dey rahey thay.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Miller *didn't* really hear what Duvall was saying because he was getting ready. He says, ""...main tayyaar ho rahaa thaa, iss liye main waaqaee nahein sun paya keh woh kiya kah rahaa thaa"" (…I was getting ready, that’s why I really couldn’t hear what he was saying). This directly contradicts the idea that he was paying close attention to Duvall's story.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Sunaney key doraan Miller parr Duvall ney tassur dala thaa:** The passage implies Duvall was talking *a lot* during the meeting (""samaat key doraan mic bahut ziyadah baat karta hay"").  While not directly stated as an ""impression,"" it shows Duvall was dominant in the conversation.
*   **B: Tayyar hotey waqt woh tawajjoh nahein dey rahaa thaa:** This is a direct statement from Miller himself.
*   **C: Snaney key waqt Duvall key do bachon ney bahut baat ki thee:** The passage states ""Do baday bachay key waalid shaadi shudah dawaal key nay miller ko bahut ziyadah mutissir nahein kiya"" (The parents of two older children, married, didn't make things easy for Miller). This means the children were contributing to the distraction.



"
Kisney tajweez di thee kehh ‘Saaf Hawa ka Qanoon’ mein nazre saaniyaan karni hongi?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Leaton nay wazir aazam key saath mulaqat key doraan 'conservative party key mahuliyati bill ko ''puri tarah aur mokammal tor parr dobarah tehreer karnay kee maang kartay hoay conservative'mahuliyati bill mein tabdil karnay kaa mutalibah kiya thaa.""  This means Jack Layton (leader of the NDP) requested a review and rewriting of the bill, effectively suggesting it undergo further scrutiny. While Stephen Harper *agreed* to send it to a committee, it was Layton who initially proposed the review.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Howard:** He defended a different action (funding for a hospital) and wasn't involved in the proposal to review the 'Clean Air Act'.
*   **B: Qadamat pasand party (Conservative Party):** Layton was requesting changes *to* their environmental bill, not suggesting a review of it themselves.
*   **D: Stephen Harper:** He agreed to the review *after* Layton requested it.



"
Kisney iss baat sey inkaar kiya thaa kehh ‘Saaf Hawa ka Qanoon’ ka istemaal election sey pahley ki baazi key tor parr kiya jaa raha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek wazeere aazam (A Prime Minister)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Magar wazire aazam john howard nay kahaa hay keh yeah amal sirf hospital kee sahulaton kee hifazat key liye thaa..."" which translates to ""However, Prime Minister John Howard said that this action was only to protect the hospital's facilities...""

This directly indicates that the Prime Minister (John Howard) denied the claim that the action regarding the Mercy Hospital was politically motivated before the election. The question asks who denied it was a pre-election tactic, and the Prime Minister is the one who did.



"
Morakkabaat cyanuric acid aur melamine uss waqt kiya tashkil diya thaa jabb unhoney billi key peshaab mein eek deegar key saath radde amal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Billor (Crystals)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""donon morakkabaat ek doosray say mill karr cristal tashkil detay hain jo gurdah key amal ko rok sakti hay.""  This translates to ""both compounds combine to form crystals that can block kidney function.""  It also says crystals were *found* when melamine and cyanuric acid levels increased in the cat's urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gurdey (Kidneys):** While the crystals *affect* the kidneys, they aren't what's being *formed* by the reaction.
* **B: Paltu janwar ka khana (Pet food):** The contaminated food *contained* the compounds, but the formation happens in the urine.
* **D: Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR):** FTIR is the *method used to identify* the crystals, not the crystals themselves.



"
Tahqiq kaaron ney infrared spectroscopy ka istemaal kiss cheez ka moshahedah karney key liye kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Paltu janwar key peshaab mein billori morakkab** (Crystal compounds in pet urine).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jab infrared spectroascopy (FTIR) key zariah mowaznah kiya gayaa to unn cristal morakkabaat kaa mail mutissirah paltu janwaron key peshaab mein payee gayee cheez say huwa.""  This translates to: ""When compared using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the match for those crystal compounds was found to be what was found in the urine of affected pets.""

Therefore, the researchers used infrared spectroscopy to *identify and confirm the presence of the crystal compounds* in the pet urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gurdah key amal** (Kidney function) - The passage states the crystals *block* kidney function, but spectroscopy wasn't used to observe the function itself.
*   **C: Motassirah paltu janwar** (Affected pets) - Spectroscopy was used on the urine, not the pets directly.
*   **D: Paltu janwar ka aaludah khana** (Contaminated pet food) -  The food was the source of the problem, but spectroscopy wasn't used to analyze the food in this specific instance.



"
Kisney Luna ko “Intehaa pasand ki malekah” kaha thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer nay kahaa hay keh, Lona extreme kee pehli raani."" This translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first queen of extreme.""  While ""intehaa pasand ki malekah"" (queen of extremes) isn't a direct translation of ""first queen of extreme"", it's the sentiment Tommy Dreamer expressed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dustin Runnels:** He expressed sadness and fondness for Luna, but didn’t give her a title like “queen”.
*   **B: Xinhua:** Xinhua reported the discovery of the flight recorders - they didn’t comment on Luna.
*   **C: Luna ka manager:** The text says Luna’s first manager *was* Luna, not that they gave her a title.



"
Kisney Luna ko “Ajeeb” kaha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: """"Distin goldist"""" raneels nay tabsarah kartay hoay kahaa keh """"lona meeri tarah shoqeen thee...shayed mujh say bhee ziyadah..unn say badaa lagao thaa aur unn kee bahut yaad aayey gee...ummid hay keh woh behtar jagah parr hogi.""""  This translates to ""Dustin Runnels commenting said, 'Luna was as passionate as me... maybe even more... had a great connection with her and will miss her a lot... hope she is in a better place.'"" While ""shoqeen"" doesn't *exactly* translate to ""eccentric"" or ""strange"" (""ajeeb""), it implies a strong personality and passion, and Runnels is the one describing Luna in this way.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unkey maddaah (Her admirers)** - The text doesn't mention anyone calling Luna ""ajeeb"" generally.
*   **C: Hukumat key tafteesh karaan (Government investigators)** - They found the flight recorders, not discussed Luna's personality.
*   **D: Tommy Dreamer** - Tommy Dreamer mentioned Luna was the first queen of extreme, not her personality.



"
Takkar mein shaamil driver key saath kiya nahein hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Uskey sar parr chotein aayein theen (He received injuries to the head)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""taham, driver ko sarr mein gehri chot aayi hay"" which translates to ""however, the driver received a deep injury to the head.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ghar key andar key kisi log ko usney zakhmi nahein kiya thaa (He didn't injure anyone inside the house):** The passage states *no one* inside the house was injured, regardless of the driver's actions.
* **C: Usey Cambridge key haspataal sey Great Yarmouth key eek haspataal mien muntaqil kiya gaya thaa (He was transferred from a Cambridge hospital to a Great Yarmouth hospital):**  The passage states the *opposite* - he was transferred *to* Cambridge *from* Great Yarmouth.
* **D: Fauri khidmaat ney usko uski gaadi sey hataney mein madad kiya (Emergency services helped him out of his car):** While true, this isn't what *happened to* the driver; it's what was *done for* him.  The question asks about what *befell* the driver.

Rugby tournament key doraan jonubi Africa key gameplay key baarey mein khadi kiya cheez nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Tournament key aaghaz mein eek polish kardah kaar kardagi** (Poor performance at the start of the tournament).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Khel mein jonubi afriqah apni jonubi behnon key khelaaf intehayi kamzor lag rahee theen lekin jaise jaise tournament aagay badhta gayaa karkardagi behtar hoti chalee gayee."" (In the game, South Africa looked very weak against their southern sisters, but as the tournament progressed, their performance improved.)

This directly indicates their gameplay wasn't strong *initially*.  The other options are mentioned as strengths they *developed*:

*   **B: Gend sanbhalney ki salahiyat** (Ball handling skills) - The passage states they had ""umdah ball handling kee maharat"" (excellent ball handling skills).
*   **D: Defaayi maharatein** (Defensive skills) - The passage mentions ""manazzam defaa"" (organized defense).
*   **A: Motassir kun ijtemaai kaam** (Affected social work) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jonugbi Africa ka game kabb behtar hona shuru hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Jaisaa kehh tournament chalta gaya** (As the tournament progressed).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""jaise jaise tournament aagay badhta gayaa karkardagi behtar hoti chalee gayee"" - meaning ""as the tournament progressed, their performance improved.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Subah 10:00 bajey key aas paas** (Around 10:00 AM) - The game started at 10:00 AM, but the text doesn't say their *game* was better then, only that it was a good day for rugby.
*   **B: Defaa key sakht honay key baad** (After the defense became stronger) - While strong defense *contributed* to their improvement, it doesn't say this was *when* it started.
*   **C: Zambia sey haarney key baad** (After losing to Zambia) - They *won* against Zambia, not lost.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah Cheen ki maeeshat ki durust tor parr akkaasi nahein karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Cheen ney Jarmani key moqabley kabhi bhi ziyadah car baramad nahein ki hay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Pehli baar cheen nay pichlay saal germani say ziyadah carein export keen"" (For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany).  Therefore, option D is a direct contradiction of the information provided in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct reflections of the text:

*   **A: Islahaat karney key baad sey cheen ki maeeshat tezi sey badhi hay** (China's economy has grown rapidly since the reforms) - The passage states China's economic size has increased 90 times since the reforms.
*   **B: Cheen key paas Amerika ki banisbat car baramadgi ki ziyadah badi market hay** (China has a larger car export market than America) - The passage states China surpassed America in car manufacturing and exported more cars than Germany, implying a strong export market.
*   **C: Cheen key paas akhir kaar Amerika ki banisbat ziyadah badi GDP ho sakti hay** (China could eventually have a larger GDP than America) - The passage suggests a significant increase in China's GDP compared to America in the next two decades.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Cheen ki GDP Amerika ko kab obur kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Do dahayion mein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Agli do dahayiyon mein america key muqabilay mein cheen kee gdp mean bahut ziyadah izafah ho sakta hay."" (In the next two decades, China's GDP could increase significantly compared to America).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ziyadah maashi islahaat key baad (After more economic reforms):** While reforms are implied as ongoing, the passage doesn't state *when* it will surpass the US, only within a timeframe.
* **C: Jabb mulk nayi qeyadat key taht hoga (When the country is under new leadership):**  The passage doesn't mention leadership change as a condition for surpassing the US.
* **D: Teen dahayion key andar (Within three decades):** The passage specifically mentions *two* decades, not three.

Hu ney taraqqi pazeer mulkon ko kiya karney ki tajweez dee thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Aaludgi key puraney raaston sey bachein** (Avoid the old ways of pollution).

The passage states the speaker encouraged developing countries to **""pehle aaludgi phailao aur baad mein safayi kro key rujhaan say ehteraz karein""** which directly translates to ""avoid the trend of pollute first and clean up later."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unn zimmah daariyon ko nibhayein jo unki taraqqi key marhalah ka moharrik ho** (Fulfill the responsibilities that drive their stage of development) - While implied, this isn't the *direct* advice given. The speaker focuses on *what not to do* first.
* **B: Maashi natijah parr tawajjoh dein** (Focus on economic results) - The speaker mentions working based on China's economic results but doesn't advise developing countries to *focus* on them.
* **C: Apni mojudah zimmah daariyon key pichey bhaagein** (Chase after their current responsibilities) - This is not mentioned in the text.



"
Hu ney kiss cheez ka zikr nahein kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon key ikhraaj ki katautiyon ka eek aadado shumaar (A specific number for carbon emission reductions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Unhon nay katoti keliye koyee aadaad wo shumaar pesh nahein kiya"" which translates to ""He did not present any specific number for the reduction.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Katautiyon ki buniyaad (The basis of the reductions):**  The passage *does* mention the basis – working based on China's economic results.
* **B: Aaludgi key motalliq taraqqi pazeer mulkon ko mashwarah dein (Advice to developing countries regarding pollution):** The passage mentions he encouraged developing countries to ""avoid the trend of pollute first, clean up later.""
* **C: Jiss tarikh tak carbon key ikhrajaat ki ummid hay kehh katauti ho jaye gee (The date by which carbon emissions are expected to be reduced):** The passage states a timeframe: ""2005 kee satah say 2020 tak"" (from the 2005 level to 2020).



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye Veerman ney kaha thaa kehh haalat achhi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Richard Virman of Medicines Sans Frontieres said: """"Angola is facing its worst outbreak of the disease and the situation in **Angola** is very bad."""" "" 

Veerman specifically stated the situation is bad *in Angola*. The other options are either organizations or a misspelling (Mangola).



"
"Moqaddamah chalney ki wajah sey, Huhne ki kabinah ka uhdah kon legaa?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hohan nay isteefa day diyaa hay aur uss kee jagah kabinah mein rukn parliament aid devi lay gaa."" This directly translates to ""Hohn has resigned and member of parliament Aid Davey will take his place in the cabinet.""

Therefore, Davey will be taking over Hohn's cabinet position.



"
Moqaddamah key baad tejarati wazeer key kirdaar ko kaun sanbhaley gaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""tawaqqo kee jaarahi hay keh rukn parliament norman lamb wazir tejarat hongay"" which translates to ""it is being expected that member of parliament Norman Lamb will be the minister of commerce"".  This directly indicates Lamb will take on the role of the commercial minister (trade minister).



"
Kaar kardagi karney waley nazreen ki Camille Saint-Saens key opera key doraan kiya karney key liye hausalah afzaayi kartey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaar kardagi keliye stage parr unsey judnaa (To join them on stage for performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Natijah key tor parr adakaron nay mushtarkah tor parr stage parhashish pie, aur theater bazaat khud saameyin ko uss mein shareek honay kee hauslah afzayi kartay nazar aaya."" 

This translates to: ""As a result, the actors enthusiastically invited the audience to join them on stage, and the theatre audience appeared encouraged to participate in it.""

This directly indicates the audience is encouraged to *join the performance on stage*.  The other options are related to the opera's subject matter (drugs, Japan, dedicating life to passion) but not what the actors are inviting the audience to *do*.



"
Opera key doraan buniyadi tor parr kon mushtarekah smoking karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Fankaar (The Artist)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the story is based on ""an artist whose life is dedicated to drugs and a love for Japan.""  The phrase ""natijah key tor parr adakaron nay mushtarkah tor parr stage par hashish pie"" (as a result, the actors collectively smoked hashish on stage) directly links the smoking to the *artist* they are portraying.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fransisi nazreen (French audience):** The passage doesn't mention the audience smoking.
* **C: Kaar kardagi karney waaley (Workers):** This isn't mentioned in the context.
* **D: Camille Saint-Saens:** While the passage *starts* by mentioning Camille Saint-Saens, it's about a story *based on* an artist, not specifically about Saint-Saens himself.



"
Leonov key anjaam deney waaley “waqfah chalan” key liye eek deegar naam kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Khalyi daud (Space Walk)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Leonov performed ""pehli baar khalayi jehaaz say baahar aaney kee insani srgarmi (aiwa), yaa """"khalaa mein chalna"""""".  ""Khalaa mein chalna"" directly translates to ""walking in space"" which is commonly known as a spacewalk.  ""Khalyi daud"" is a suitable translation of ""spacewalk"" in Urdu/Hindi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apollo-Soyuz mission:** This was a mission Leonov *later* led, ten years after his spacewalk. It's not a name for the spacewalk itself.
* **C: Gair qanooni sargarmi (Illegal activity):** This is completely irrelevant to the text.
* **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is a nickname for Leonov, not the name of his spacewalk.



"
Leonov ney Soviet key kiss mission key hissah ki qeadat ki thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Das saal baad, unhon nay apolo- swewz mission key soviet hissay kee qeyadat kee..."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khalayi daud (Space Race)** - While Leonov was *part* of the Space Race, he didn't *lead* a mission called ""Khalayi daud"".
*   **C: Cosmonaut No. 11** - This is a nickname for Leonov, not a mission.
*   **D: EVA (Extravehicular Activity)** - This refers to his spacewalk, not a mission he led.



"
Takkar mein kon zakhmi hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""gibson ko eek hospital tak pahunchaya gayaa magar woh kuch der baad hee margaya"" which translates to ""Gibson was taken to a hospital but died shortly after."" This directly indicates Gibson was injured in the accident, although fatally.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eek garage ka molaazim (A garage worker)** - The worker witnessed the accident and described the scene, but wasn't *injured* in it.
* **C: Bachchey (Children)** - The children were scared and ran away, but the text doesn't say they were hurt.
* **D: Eek truck driver (A truck driver)** - The text explicitly states the truck driver was unharmed: ""64 salah truck driver ko uss tasadum key doraan koyee chot nahein aayi thee"" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured during the accident).



"
Haadsah mein shaamil logon key saath kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek zakhmi hua tha, eek mar gaya thaa** (One was injured, one died).

Here's why:

* **Gibson** was taken to the hospital but died shortly after - meaning he *died*.
* The **64-year-old truck driver** was not injured - meaning he was *injured* (or rather, *not* injured, but option B reflects someone being injured in the accident).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh dono mar gaye thay** (Both died) - Incorrect, only Gibson died.
* **C: Wohh cheenkh aur chilla rahey thay** (They were screaming and yelling) - This describes the *children* witnessing the accident, not what happened *to* the people involved.
* **D: Dono zakhmi huey thay** (Both were injured) - Incorrect, the truck driver was unharmed.



"
Progaram parr kaam kar rahey saensadaan darjah zail mein sey kiskey sabab honay waley asaraat ka moshahedah kaney ki ummid kar rahey thay?,"The correct answer is **D: Tareek moamilah (Dark matter)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*dark matter dosray dark meter parr usee tarah asar andaaz hotay hain jis tarah aam meter daaltay hain.*"" and ""...*kahkushan key ird gird mojud ziyadah tar seeyah maaddah eek haalay kee shakal mein kahkushan key ird gird mojud hay, aur yeah bahut say chhote zarraat parr mushtamil hay.*""  

This directly links the observed effects to dark matter and its interaction with other dark matter, mirroring the gravitational effects of ordinary matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baqaedah moamilah (Regular matter):** While the passage draws an analogy to regular matter, the *effects* being studied are specifically related to dark matter.
*   **B: Samundari taqatein (Oceanic forces):** The mention of tides is an *analogy* to explain the gravitational pull, but the study isn't about ocean forces.
*   **C: Chotey zarraat (Small particles):**  The passage says dark matter *consists* of small particles, but the observed effects are due to the *interaction* of dark matter itself, not just the particles themselves.



"
Saensadaan darjah zail mein kiskey moamilah ka moshahidah kar rahey thay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dakh kahkushaan aur Milky Way (Distant galaxies and the Milky Way)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the team was looking for effects ""between the dark meter of distant galaxies and the dark meter of the Milky Way.""  It compares this to the moon's gravitational pull on Earth and the Milky Way exerting force on galactic arcs. Therefore, the scientists were observing the interaction between distant galaxies and our own Milky Way galaxy.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, qadamat pasandon ney kiss parr tanqid nahein ki thee?","The correct answer is **B: Tameere naz key koshish ki kami** (Lack of effort in reconstruction).

Here's why:

The passage states the criticism revolved around *how* reconstruction spending was happening (""...imdaad aur baaz tameer parr hoay masarif kee baabat tanazuah thaa..."") and *who* was benefiting from it (""...mezahan """"bush kee new arlens deal"""" kaa unwaan diyaa..."" - implying accusations of favoritism and waste). It specifically mentions the focus of criticism is on awarding reconstruction contracts to employees settled in Washington D.C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raahat kharch karnaa** (Spending on relief) - The passage directly mentions spending *on* relief and reconstruction as the subject of the dispute.
* **C: Jisey tameere naz key moahedon sey nawazaa ja raha hay** (Those being rewarded by reconstruction contracts) - This is a core part of the criticism, as the passage states the issue is *who* is getting the contracts.
* **D: Tameere nav ka kharcha karnaa** (Spending on reconstruction) - The passage directly addresses the *spending* on reconstruction as the point of contention.

The passage *doesn't* suggest any criticism about a *lack of effort* in trying to reconstruct.  It's about *how* the reconstruction efforts were being managed and *who* was profiting from them.



"
Hurricane Katrina ki raahat koshishon keliye tameere nav key moahedaat ki kon tanqid kar rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Maali qadamat pasand (Fiscal Conservatives)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*jisay baaz maaliyaati qadamat pasandon nay mezahan """"bush kee new arlens deal"""" kaa unwaan diyaa.*"" ( ""...which some fiscal conservatives jokingly called """"Bush's New Orleans Deal"""").

This directly indicates that *fiscal conservatives* were critical of the reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Katrina, specifically regarding the spending involved.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aazad khiyaal (Liberals/Free Thinkers):** The passage doesn't mention liberals or free thinkers being critical.
* **C: Bush:** The passage implies criticism *of* Bush's actions (the ""deal"") *by* others, not Bush criticizing himself.
* **D: Washington key andruni log (Washington Insiders):** The passage mentions Washington-based employees receiving reconstruction contracts, but doesn't say they were critical of the efforts.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Stardust khalayi jahaaz sey roshniyaan kahaan sabsey pahley maryee hui theen?","The correct answer is **B: Shumaali California**.

The passage states: ""Capsule kaafi hadd tak aasmaan say guzartay hoay shahaabe saqib kee tarah nazar aayega... yeah shumali california key maghribi saahil key oper say guzray gaa aur california say lay karr wastee auregon aur phir newada aur adaho key asmaan ko roshan karta huwa yutah mein chala jaye gaa"".  

This directly translates to: ""The capsule will pass over the western coast of Northern California and then illuminate the skies from California to Oregon, then Nevada and Idaho before continuing to Utah.""

Therefore, the lights were first seen over Northern California."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Khalayi jahaaz darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye record qayem karey gaa?","The correct answer is **C: Zameen tak sabsey tez waapas aana (Returning to Earth the fastest)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Stardust zameen parr wapas aaney waali tez tareen khalayi gaadi honey kaa eek naya record qayem karay gaa"" which translates to ""Stardust will establish a new record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asmaan ki sabsey wasee range ko roshan karna (Illuminating the widest range of sky):** While the passage mentions the light show, it doesn't state this is a record being broken.
*   **B: Ziyadah tarr shaharon mein maryee honaa (Landing in more cities):** The passage doesn't focus on where it lands, but *how fast* it returns.
*   **D: San Francisco sey Los Angeles tak sabsey tez safar karna (Traveling fastest from San Francisco to Los Angeles):** This is mentioned as an example of the speed, but isn’t the actual record being broken.



"
Doctor Malar Balasubramanian ka Saroja Balasubramanian sey kiya rishtah thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Maan**

The text states: ""…53 salah Saroja Balasubramanium kee lash payee jo khoon aalud kambalon say dahki hoyee thee"" and earlier mentions ""29 salah doctor Millar Bala Subramanium…"".  This clearly indicates Saroja Balasubramanium was the mother of Dr. Millar Balasubramanium.



"
Sara Balasubramanian ki laash kahaan mili thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Car ki diggi mein** (In the car trunk).

The text states: ""Vahan unhon nay 53 salah saroja balasubramanium kee lash payee jo khoon aalud kambalon say dahki hoyee thee."" (There they found the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramanium, covered with blood-stained blankets *in the trunk*.)

While the incident occurred near Pittsburgh and involved a doctor from Cincinnati, the body was specifically found *in the car trunk*.  Therefore, options A, B, and D are incorrect.



"
eBay ney keya haasil kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states eBay acquired (bought) Skype. It's described as eBay's ""greatest acquisition"" and they hoped to leverage Skype's popularity in certain regions.

Therefore, eBay *haasil kiya* (acquired) **Skype**."
Hosulyaabi key saath eBay kiya haasil kar raha tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Naye elaqon mein tausee karnaa (Expanding into new regions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states eBay hopes to ""paida karay gee aur inn shoabon mein maqboliyat haasil karay gee"" (generate and gain popularity) in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil – where Skype is already strong. This directly indicates an effort to *expand into new regions*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iski aamadni ko mazboot karnaa (Strengthening its income):** While expansion *can* lead to increased income, the passage focuses on *where* they are expanding, not just increasing income.
*   **C: Iski profile ko badhana (Raising its profile):** Expansion can raise a profile, but that's a consequence, not the primary goal stated.
*   **D: Iskey shirkat kunindagaan ko mutmain karna (Reassuring its stakeholders):** The passage doesn't mention anything about reassuring stakeholders.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Unn qaidiyon key saath kisney taamul kiya thaa jo ladayi key baad sahan mein rah gaye thay?","The correct answer is **A: Mozakiraat kaar (Negotiators)**.

The text states: ""Mozakerah kaaron nay soorat hal kee islaah kee koshish kee..."" which means ""Negotiators tried to resolve the situation..."". This clearly indicates that the negotiators interacted with the prisoners who remained in the yard after the fight.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aag sey bachao key amaley (Firefighters)** - They only entered the yard *after* the fire started, to extinguish it.
*   **C: Afsaraan (Officers)** - They entered the yard *after* the fire and used tear gas. They didn't initially interact with the prisoners.
*   **D: Haspataal ka amalah (Hospital staff)** - They were involved with the *injured* prisoners, not those who stayed in the yard.



"
Darjah zail mein sey akhir kaar kiski wajah sey qaidi fasaad sey waapas shaant huey thay?,"The correct answer is **B: Aansu gas** (Tear gas).

Here's why:

The passage states that after the fire, ""hifazati saamaan say lais afsaran yard mein daakhil hoay aur makinon ko tear gas say muntashir kiya"" (officers equipped with protective gear entered the yard and dispersed the inmates with tear gas). This directly indicates that tear gas was used and led to the inmates being controlled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kamiyaab mozakiraat** (Successful negotiations): The passage specifically states ""qaidiyon key mutalibat waazeh nahein hain"" (the inmates' demands were not clear), implying negotiations weren't successful.
*   **C: Saathi zakhmi qaidi** (Injured inmate comrades): While the initial conflict started after wounded inmates were transferred, the passage doesn't suggest they caused the eventual calming of the situation.
*   **D: Eek aag** (A fire): The fire was *contained* by firefighters, it didn't calm the inmates down - it preceded the use of tear gas.



"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei key nazriyah mein, mulke Iran ko apney aap ko kis cheez sey aazad karana chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Tel parr inhesaar (Dependence on oil)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mulk key supreme leader, aayat allah alee khumaini nay 1979 mein iraan key islaami inqilaab say pehle key tel parr inhesaar ko """"eek jaal"""" qaraar diyaa hay aur kahaa keh mulk ko uss say khud ko azad karaana hoga."" 

This directly translates to: ""The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the dependence on oil before the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979 a ""trap"" and said that the country must free itself from it.""



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Irani maeeshat parr pabandi key asaraat ka kisney eteraaf kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Senior zaraaye** (Senior sources).

The passage states: ""Tellivision parr braah raast pehli dafah yeah tabsarah keh **eek ahem irani zaraye** nay yeah qabool kiya keh manzori key asraat hain.""  This directly translates to ""For the first time, it was reported that **an important Iranian source** acknowledged the effects of sanctions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC:** While OPEC reported the drop in oil exports, they didn't *acknowledge the effects of the sanctions* – they simply stated a fact.
* **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He criticized reliance on oil *before* the revolution, not acknowledged the current impact of sanctions.
* **D: European Union:** The EU *imposed* the sanctions, they didn't acknowledge their effects.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon France key voting amal ka hissah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ummidwaaron key nomaindon key zariyah vote giney gaye (Votes counted by representatives of the candidates)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *volunteers* count the votes under strict supervision and rules, not representatives of the candidates. While candidates *can* send representatives to oversee the *process* (option B), they don't actually do the counting themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are part of the French voting process:

*   **A: Saaf shaffaaf voting key boxes (Transparent voting boxes):** The passage explicitly states transparent ballot boxes are required since 1988.
*   **B: Ummidwaaron key bhejey gaye nomaindey (Representatives sent by candidates):** The passage says candidates have the right to send representatives to supervise.
*   **C: Voting roll mein dastakhat karna (Signing the voting roll):** The passage clearly states voters sign the voting roll after placing their ballot.



"
Vote deney waaley apney muntakhab ummidwar ka kahaan isharah kartey hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek pahley sey chapi hui kaghaza ki sheet parr** (On a pre-printed paper sheet).

The passage states: ""raaye dehindgan voting booth mein khud ko alag kartay hain, pehle say chhapi hoyee kaghaz kee sheet parr apni pasand key ummidwar ko nishaan zad karkay usay eek lifafay mein daal detay hain."" (Voters isolate themselves in the voting booth, mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed paper sheet, and then put it in an envelope.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek voting roll parr** - The voting roll is where they sign *after* voting, not where they indicate their choice.
*   **C: Eek lefafey parr** - They put their marked sheet *into* an envelope, but don't mark the envelope itself.
*   **D: Booth key andar eek machine parr** - The passage specifically describes a paper-based system, not a machine.



"
Konsi cheez Allen key liye Musashi ki aath salah talaash shuru karney ka baes bani?,"The correct answer is **C: Samundari daryaaft mein uski sarmayah kaari** (His investment in maritime discovery).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ailan nay mubayyanah tor parr apni ziyadah tar dolat samundari taftish mein kharch kee aur apni puri zindagi jang mein dilchaspi rakhnay kee wajah say mosashi ko dhoondnay keliye apni jadujehad kartay rahay.""  This directly translates to: ""Allen explicitly spent most of his wealth on maritime investigation and continued to strive to find Musashi due to his lifelong interest in war.""

While his wealth *enabled* the search (A), the **initial trigger** was his investment *in* the maritime discovery - the confirmation of the receipt (the discovery mentioned in the first sentence) led to the eight-year search *because* he had already invested in the underwater exploration. His interest in war is a reason *why* he wanted to find the Musashi, but the investment is what *allowed* the search to begin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uski daulat (His wealth):** Wealth was a *means* to the search, not the *cause* of starting it.
*   **B: Samundari farsh ki naqshah kaari mein uski dilchasi (His interest in seafloor mapping):** The passage mentions seafloor mapping as a *method* used to locate the ship, not the reason for the search itself.
*   **D: Jang mein uski dilchasi (His interest in war):** This explains his motivation for wanting to find the Musashi, but not what *started* the eight-year search.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Allen ney apney paisey ki ahem miqdaar kis cheez parr kharch ki thee?","The correct answer is **B: Samundari daryaaft (Maritime exploration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ailan nay mubayyanah tor parr apni ziyadah tar dolat samundari taftish mein kharch kee"" which translates to ""Ailan explicitly spent most of his wealth on maritime exploration.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Musashi ko bahaal karnaa (Restoring the Musashi):** While finding the Musashi *was* a goal, the passage says the money was spent on the *exploration* itself, not just restoring the ship.
*   **C: Eek ROV tameer karna (Building an ROV):** The ROV was a *tool* used in the exploration, not the primary expense.
*   **D: Samundari farsh ki naqshah kaari key baarey mein janana (Learning about seafloor mapping):**  Seafloor mapping was a part of the exploration, but not the entirety of the expenditure.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon mumkanah tor parr plant key andar aur ird gird key khatarnaak halaat ka baes hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Uranium eendhan (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Hukkaam andazah lagaa rahay hain keh iss say zahir hota hay keh site parr mojud johri eendhan waale dabbay phat gaye hain aur uss say rasao ho rahaa hay.""  This translates to: ""Officials estimate that this indicates the fuel rods at the site have ruptured and are leaking.""  ""Johri eendhan"" specifically refers to uranium fuel (nuclear fuel).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Radioactive caesium:** While caesium *was detected* as a result of the incident, it wasn't the *cause* of it. It's a byproduct of the fuel rod rupture.
*   **C: Safed dhuwaan (White smoke):** The white smoke is a *symptom* of the problem, not the cause.
*   **D: Iodine:** Like caesium, iodine was detected, but it’s a result of the fuel issue, not the initiating event.

Therefore, the rupture of the uranium fuel rods is the most likely cause of the dangerous situation described in the text.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon plant mein haadsah key baad maqaami bashindon ko tajweez kardah mahfooz nikaat mein sey eek nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Air condition ki ekayion sey bachein (Avoid using air conditioning units)**.

Here's why:

The passage states local authorities are advising residents to **turn off air conditioners** (airconditioner band karnay).  It *doesn't* say to avoid the units themselves, but rather to stop using them to prevent drawing in potentially contaminated air.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Andar qeaam karein (Stay indoors)** - The passage explicitly states residents are being advised to stay inside (gharon key andar hee rehney).
*   **C: Safed dhuwaan andar leney sey bachein (Avoid inhaling white smoke)** - The report describes white smoke and implies avoiding exposure.
*   **D: Tap ka paani piney sey baaz rahein (Refrain from drinking tap water)** - The passage says not to drink water from the tap (nall say paani nah pinay).



"
"Doctor Moll key hisaab sey, XDR-TB key baarey mein sabsey ziyadah fikar ki baat kiya hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yeah bahut halakat ki sharah hay (It has a very high mortality rate)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Doctor Moll said the new strain is ""bahut ziyadah preeshan kunn hay aur halakat kee sharah bahut ziyadah honey kee wajah say ziyadah khatarnaak hay"" which translates to ""very worrying and more dangerous because of the very high mortality rate."" This directly indicates that the high mortality rate is his biggest concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeah motaghayyar haspataal mein contact mein aa raha thaa (The variant was spreading in the hospital):** While the hospital is where it was *discovered*, the passage doesn't emphasize spread *within* the hospital as the primary concern.
*   **B: Motaghayyar ki dawaon sey mozahemat (The variant's resistance to drugs):** While XDR-TB *is* drug-resistant, Doctor Moll focuses on the *outcome* of that resistance – the high mortality rate.
*   **C: Eek motssirah shakhs jitney miqdaar key logon ko motassir kar sakta hay (How many people one infected person can infect):** The passage mentions this (10-15 people), but it's presented as a detail supporting *why* the situation is dangerous, not the primary worry itself.



"
Naye motaghayyar key saath contact mein aaney waaley kitney marizon key baarey mein sehat ki dekh bhaal key molazmeen key tor parr hui hay?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eek saal kee muddat mein eek mutissirah shakhs qareeb mein rehney waale **10 say 15 afraad** ko mutissir kar sakta hay."" (In a year, one infected person can affect approximately **10 to 15** people nearby.)

The question asks about how many patients healthcare workers *think* have been affected by the new variant. The passage directly states the estimate is 10-15 people per infected individual.



"
NextGen system kis qism ki taknik ka istemaal karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Satellite-parr mabni taknik** (Satellite-based technology).

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah settlite parr mabni technology kaa istemaal karta hay..."" (It uses satellite-based technology...).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sehat sey motalliq taknik** (Health-related technology) - The passage doesn't mention anything about health.
* **C: Zameeni-radar-parr mabni taknik** (Ground-radar-based technology) - The passage states NextGen *differs* from old ground-radar technology.
* **D: Carbon ikhrajaat ki taknik** (Carbon emissions technology) - While NextGen *reduces* carbon emissions, it doesn't *use* technology specifically for measuring or managing them; it uses satellite tech for flight paths.

NextGen fazayi traffic key controll kerney walon ko barahe raast kaisey fayedah pahunchata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah mukhtasar udaan key raastey (Shorter flight routes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that NextGen allows aircraft to fly on **""chhote raaston parr parwaz""** (shorter routes). This leads to fuel savings and reduced carbon emissions, but the *primary* benefit to air traffic controllers is the ability to direct planes along these more efficient paths.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct answers to the question:

*   **B: Ziyadah durust hawai jahaaz key mahallaate waqoo (More accurate aircraft locations):** While NextGen *provides* more accurate location data, the benefit to controllers is *using* that data to create shorter routes. It's a means to an end, not the end itself.
*   **C: Kam kiya hua carbon key ikhrajaaat (Reduced carbon emissions):** This is a *result* of NextGen, not a direct benefit *to* air traffic controllers.
*   **D: Kam eendhan (Less fuel):** Similar to carbon emissions, this is a consequence, not a primary benefit for controllers.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Moarrikhin ney kiss cheez parr tawajjo diya jaaney key liye FBI par tnaqid nahi ki hay?","The correct answer is **C: Fuhush nigaari key cason par ziyadah tawajjoh dena (Giving too much attention to pornography cases)**.

Here's why:

The passage states historians criticized the FBI for *focusing on easily solvable cases, like stolen cars*, to inflate their success rate. It also mentions Congress *mandating* the FBI dedicate resources to pornography.  The passage doesn't say historians criticized the FBI *for* focusing on pornography; rather, it states Congress *directed* them to do so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apni kamiyaabi ki sharah ko badha chadha kar batana (Exaggerating their success rate):** The passage explicitly states historians criticized the FBI for this.
*   **B: Aasani sey hal honey waaley jarayem key wasail ki takhsees karna (Prioritizing easily solvable crimes):**  This is directly stated as a point of criticism.
*   **D: Chori shudah car ke case (Stolen car cases):** These are used as an *example* of the easily solvable crimes the historians say the FBI focused on.



"
Fahhashi ki pahal FBI ko keya karney key liye majboor karti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Fahash nigaari key cason key liye agenton ko waqf karney** (To dedicate agents to pornography cases).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Congress nay maali saal 2005 mein fahhashi roknay key iqdamat kee maali eanat shuroo kee aur waazeh kiya keh F B I ko apnay 10 karindon ko balighon kee fahash nigaari roknay keliye waqf karnaa paray gaa."" (Congress began funding efforts to curb obscenity in fiscal year 2005 and clarified that the FBI would have to dedicate 10 of its agents to stopping adult pornography).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chori shudah car key cason key liye mazeed hawaley deney** (To refer more cases of stolen cars) - The passage mentions criticism of the FBI *for* focusing on easy-to-solve cases like stolen cars, not for needing to refer more.
*   **B: Agency ki kamiyaabi ki sharah ko badha chadha kar bataney** (To exaggerate the agency's success rate) - The passage says historians criticize the FBI, not that the FBI is trying to inflate its success rate.
*   **C: Jo jaraim aasan honay chahiyein unn parr tawajjoh deney** (To focus on crimes that should be easy) - This is what the historians *criticize* the FBI for doing, not what the obscenity initiative forces them to do.



"
39c jas grapin ki takkar ka jawaab deney waali aag ki gaadi key saath keya hua thaa? ,"The correct answer is **B: Wohh ludhak gayi thee** (It overturned).

The text specifically states: ""Maqami media nay bataya keh hawai adday kee eek aag bhujhanay waali gaadi karrwayi kartay waqt ulat gayee."" which translates to ""Local media reported that a fire engine at the airport overturned while operating.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh takra gayi thee** (It collided) - The text doesn't mention it colliding with anything *other* than the initial plane crash being responded to.
*   **C: Usmein dhamakah ho gaya thaa** (It exploded) - The text doesn't mention any explosion with the fire engine.
*   **D: Uski gas khatam ho gayi thee** (It ran out of gas) - This isn't mentioned in the text at all.



"
"39c jas grapin ki takkar key baad, airport ko kiskey liye band kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: tejarti parwazon** (commercial flights).

The text states: ""...jis key baes hawai adday kee **tejarti parwazein** band karni padeen"" which translates to ""...which led to the base airport having to **stop commercial flights**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aag ki gaadiyon** - While a fire truck *did* overturn, the airport wasn't closed *because* of the fire trucks, but because of the plane crash.
* **C: Maqaami media** - The local media *reported* on the event, but didn't cause the closure.
* **D: Squadron Leader** - The pilot's name is given, but he didn't cause the airport to be closed.



"
Irani inqilaab key doraan brazizensky nay kisko rahnumayi pesh kash ki thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states: ""Uss nay qomi salamati mosheer kee haisiyat say aalimi muamilat ko sfarti tor parr sanbhalne mein carter kee madad kee, jaise... irani inqilaab..."" 

This translates to: ""In his capacity as National Security Advisor, he helped Carter manage international affairs, such as... the Iranian Revolution...""

Therefore, Brzezinski advised **Carter** during the Iranian Revolution."
1977 tak kisney qomi salamati musheer ka uhdah sanbhala thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states: ""...1977 ta1981 tak hennry kasenger kee jagah qomi salamati mosheer (N S A) key tor parr apni khidmaat anjaam deen.""  This translates to: ""...from 1977 to 1981 he replaced Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor (NSA).""

Therefore, Kissinger held the position *before* Brzezinski took over in 1977."
Darjah zail mein sey kon partizan belgrade key saath bobeek key career ki durust tor parr akkasi nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Uney team key liye kheltey huey 468 sey ziyadah goal kiye thay**.

Here's why:

The passage states Bobeek scored **403** goals in 468 matches. Option A claims he scored *more* than 468 goals, which directly contradicts the information provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Usney kisi bhi deegar kheladi ki banisbat ziyadah goal kiye thay** - The passage states ""Babeek say ziyadah kabhi kisee aur nay nah to haaziri di aur nah hee club key liye goal banaye."" (No one has attended or scored more goals for the club than Bobeek).
*   **C: Usko team ki tarikh mein eek baar behtareen khelaadi chuna gaya thaa** - The passage states ""1995aa mein usay partizan kee tareekh mein behtareen khiladi qaraar diyaa gayaa"" (In 1995, he was named the best player in Partizan's history).
*   **D: Usney kisi bhee deegar khelaadi ki banisbat ziyadah gamon mein hissah liya thaa** - The passage states ""Babeek say ziyadah kabhi kisee aur nay nah to haaziri di aur nah hee club key liye goal banaye."" This implies he played in more matches than any other player.



"
Partizan belgrade key saath bobeek ki tarikh key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Usney 1995 tak Partizan keliye khela thaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Bobek played for Partizan from 1945 to 1958.  Option C claims he played until 1995, which is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Usney 1945 mein partizan keliye khelnaa shuru kiya** - The passage states, ""Unhon nay 1945 mein unn mein shomooliyat ekhtiyar kee"" (He joined them in 1945).
* **B: Uney partizan belgrade sey pahley Zagreb keliye khelaa thaa** - The passage states, ""Croshiya key darulhukumat zaghrab mein paida honey waale bobeek"" (Bobek, born in the capital Zagreb...). This implies he was associated with Zagreb before Partizan.
* **D: Usey Partizan ka betareen kheladi chuney jaaney key bad shurat haasil hui thee** -  The passage states, ""1995aa mein usay partizan kee tareekh mein behtareen khiladi qaraar diyaa gayaa"" (In 1995, he was named the best player in Partizan history).  While the passage doesn't *explicitly* say this led to fame, it's a reasonable inference.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi khosusiyat Hespronex ko velocroptor sey mkhtalif banati hay?","The correct answer is **B: Iska eek ziyadah badaa dusra panjah hai (It has a much larger second claw)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Uss kaa dosra panjah nisbatan badaa thaa, jokeh hespironex naam kee maqboliyat kaa baes banaa jis kaa matlab """"maghribi panjah"""" hota hay."" (Its second claw was relatively large, which was the basis for the acceptance of the name Hespronex, which means ""western claw"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iskey do pair hein (It has two legs):** The passage states Hespronex walks on two legs *like* velociraptors, meaning it's a similarity, not a difference.
*   **C: Iska puri tarah jis wala jism hay (It has a fully feathered body):** This is a characteristic *shared* with velociraptors, as the passage mentions they were considered fully feathered.
*   **D: Yeah garam khoon wala hay (It is warm-blooded):**  Again, this is a trait the passage ascribes to *both* Hespronex and velociraptors.



"
“Hespronex” ks matlab parjaatiyon ki kiss jismani khususiyat sey maakhuz hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Panjah (panjey)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...jokeh hespironex naam kee maqboliyat kaa baes banaa jis kaa matlab """"maghribi panjah"""" hota hay.""  This translates to ""...which was the basis for the acceptance of the name ""Hespronex"" which means ""western claw/paw"".""

Therefore, ""Hespronex"" is derived from a characteristic of the creature's **claw/paw (panjah)**.



"
Shoot karney key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Buffalo mein eek saal pahley iss jodey ki shaadi hui thee.**

Here's why:

The text states the couple got married *in Texas* a year ago, and *came to Buffalo* to celebrate with friends and family. It does *not* say they got married in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

* **A: Shohar aur biwi donon Texas sey thay** - The text explicitly states they got married in Texas.
* **B: Wahan paanch motassirin they** - Four died in the shooting, and the husband's wife was injured, making a total of five affected people.
* **D: Shoot karaa Buffalo mein waqea hua thaa** - The text clearly states the shooting incident happened in Buffalo.



"
Jahaan shooting hui thee wahaan ki taqrib key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Yeah jodey ki shaadi mein waqea hua thaa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the shooting happened at an anniversary celebration *of* a couple who got married the previous year.** It didn't happen *at* the wedding itself.
* **A** is correct: The event took place in Buffalo.
* **B** is correct: The organizers had scheduled a formal event for the anniversary.
* **C** is correct: The couple got married in Texas and came to Buffalo to celebrate.

Therefore, only option D is a misrepresentation of the information provided in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Luno key baarey mein afsaraan key dariyaan ibtadai tashweesh kiya thee?","The correct answer is **A: Khaad key samaan ki kami (Lack of cargo)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ibteda mein ahal kaaron ko khadsha thaa keh jahaaz say saamaan ubal jaye gaa"" which translates to ""initially, people feared that the cargo would spill from the ship."" This directly indicates their initial worry was about the *loss of the cargo*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lahrein aur tez hawayein (Waves and strong winds)**: While these *caused* the ship to wreck, they weren't the initial concern of the officials.
*   **C: Eendhan ka bahao (Fuel spill)**: The text mentions the fuel being present, but not that there was initial concern about it spilling.
*   **D: Amalah key araakin par mumkanah hamlah (Possible attack on crew members)**: This is not mentioned at all in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Luno ki toot key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tootney key waqt jahaaz mein 100 meter eendhan thaa.**

Here's why:

The passage states Lono had *160-120 cubic meters* of fuel when it broke down, not 100 meters.  

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Samaan uthaney sey pahley toot waqea hui thee** - The text says the ship was *going to* load cargo, implying the breakdown happened before loading began.
* **C: Amalah key barahh araakin mein sey, eek zakhmi hua thaa** - The text specifically states ""sirf eek shakhs kee naak tooti thee"" (only one person's nose was broken).
* **D: Jahaz ko sahili rukawat mein dhakel diya gaya thaa** - The passage clearly states ""tez hawa aur lahron nay uss ko saahil parr banny rokaat mein dhakel diyaa"" (strong winds and waves pushed it onto coastal reefs).



"
Kis dahaai mein Algeria ko aazadi mili thee?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 kee dahayi** (1960s).

The text states: ""1960 kee dahayi mein woh film direction kee tarbiyat denay kee gharz say naw azad aljazair ko wapas aaya."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he returned to newly independent Algeria to train in film direction.""  This clearly indicates Algeria gained independence *in* the 1960s.



"
Akhiri rosumaat ki taqrib keliye television screen kahaan set up nahein hui thee?,"The correct answer is **D: St. Peter key morabbah mein** (In St. Peter's Square).

Here's why:

The passage states that TV screens were set up *because* it wasn't possible for everyone to reach Saint Peter's Square for the funeral. This implies there were *no* screens *in* Saint Peter's Square itself – people had to watch on screens *outside* of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Purey rome mein** (Throughout Rome) - The passage explicitly says screens *were* set up in multiple locations in Rome.
*   **B: Itly key motaddid shahron mein** (In multiple cities in Italy) - The passage states screens were set up in other Italian cities.
*   **C: Poland key makhsus mahallate waqoo** (Specific areas in Poland) - The passage says a similar setup was made in Poland.



"
Akhiri rosum ki taqrib kahaan munaqid hui thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Rome key motaddid maqaamat mein** (At multiple locations in Rome).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rome key mutaddid maqamat parr mutaddid baray size key TV screen nasab kiyey gaye taakeh log taqrib ko dekh sakein.""  This directly translates to ""Multiple large TV screens were installed at multiple locations in Rome so that people could watch the ceremony.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Poland mein** - While Poland *also* had setups to watch, the ceremony itself was broadcast *to* Poland, not held there.
*   **C: St. Peter key morabbah mein** - The passage says it was impossible for everyone to reach Saint Peter's Square due to the large crowd, meaning the main event wasn't *only* there. It was broadcast *to* places like Saint Peter's Square.
*   **D: Pahley Rome mein, firr Itly key kisi deegar shahar mein** - The passage doesn't mention the ceremony happening in other Italian cities, only that it was broadcast to them.



"
"Dhamakah key baad, sangeen zakhmon key liye kiska elaaj kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Kam sey kam paanch log** (At least five people).

The text states: ""Kisee key ziyadah zakhmi honey kee ittelaa nahein thee, lekin dhamakay key waqat jaye waqoo parr mojud kam az kam paanch afraad kaa sadme kee alamaat keliye elaaj kiya gayaa thaa.""  This translates to: ""There was no report of anyone being seriously injured, but at least five people present at the scene at the time of the explosion were treated for symptoms of shock.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koyi nahein** (None) - The text explicitly states five people *were* treated.
* **C: Eek gas company ka afsar** (A gas company officer) - While a gas company officer was present, the text doesn't say *they* received treatment.
* **D: Eek padosi** (A neighbor) - The neighbor *reported* the leak, but wasn't mentioned as being treated.



"
Gas rasaai ki kisney ittelaa di thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaarat ka eek padosi** (A neighbor of the building).

The text states: ""Eek padosi kee taraf say phone key zariah gas leak honey kee khabar denay ke baad..."" (After a neighbor reported a gas leak by phone...). 

Therefore, a neighbor reported the gas leak.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, hamlah mein kitney log wafaat paa gaye thay?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""Haadsah mein 25 salah necolas elden, aur 21 salah cued back kee maut hogayi."" This translates to ""In the accident, 25 members of Nicolas Elden died, and 21 members of Cued Back died.""  Therefore, a total of 25 + 21 = 46 people died in the accident. 

However, the prompt states that ""25 salah necolas elden, *aur* 21 salah cued back kee maut hogayi."" which means 25 AND 21.

The prompt then states ""cudeback gaadi challa rahay they"" which means they were driving. This implies they were driving the vehicle that caused the accident. 

The text further details injuries to several individuals, but explicitly states the *deaths* of those 25 and 21.

Therefore, the prompt is looking for the initial number given.

**Therefore, the answer is 46.** However, since it isn't an option, we must go with the closest number and analyze the context.

The prompt could be tricking us. The prompt could be asking how many people are actually DEAD from the incident, aside from the initial 25 and 21. The prompt lists injuries to people like Edger, Christopher, Yuka, and Schneider. The prompt states that Schneider is in constant pain and permanently disfigured. But this doesn't necessarily mean he is dead.

If we go with the premise that the prompt is looking for the initial number mentioned, and assuming that the prompt is simply attempting to trick us and wants us to add 25 + 21 = 46. Given that 46 is not an option, it is likely that the prompt is referring to the immediate deaths from the prompt.

""Haadsah mein 25 salah necolas elden, aur 21 salah cued back kee maut hogayi""

If we simply focus on the prompt and the question, the answer is: **A: 4**. It could be a trick question.
"
Hamlah key doraan kisi moqaam parr kiska aslahaa chalney mein nakaam ho gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Jab uss nay panchwen shakhs key sarr parr usay taanaa to yuka kaa hathiyar fail ho gayaa."" This translates to ""When he taunted the fifth person on the head, Uka's weapon malfunctioned.""

Therefore, Uka's weapon failed during the attack."
Konsa darjah zail khel Olympic program sey baahar ho gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

The passage states: ""Scosesh, karaatey aur roller sports neez basket ball aur soft ball nay olympic programme mein daakhilah kee koshish kee, jo 2005 mein olympic games say khaarij karr diye gaye they.""  Softball is closely related to baseball and the text indicates both were excluded in 2005.

While karate is mentioned as *trying* to get back in, it hadn't been previously removed. Rugby is returning *to* the Olympics, not having been removed recently. Squash isn't mentioned at all."
Konsey darhah zail khelon ko aalami Olympic Committee ney khelon mein shaamil karney key liye vote kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The text specifically states: ""ragbi, khaas tor parr ragbi union, aur golf ko olympics mein shaamil karnay keliye deegar paanch khelon parr tarjih di gayee."" (rugby, especially rugby union, and golf were preferred over other five sports to be included in the Olympics.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rollersports** - The text says rollersports *tried* to get included, but were not selected.
*   **B: Baseball** - The text mentions basketball and softball, but not baseball.
*   **D: Softball** - While softball is mentioned, rugby union was specifically highlighted as being prioritized.



"
Arthur Guinness ney dar asal St James’ Gate Brewery ko kitney saal key liye lease parr liya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The text states: ""Ireland key doublin mein sant james get bravery keliye 9,000 saal key lease parr 24 setambar 1759 ko aarthar ganees nay dastakhat kiye.""  This translates to: ""Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease for St James' Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland on September 24, 1759.""

Therefore, Arthur Guinness leased the brewery for 9000 years."
Guinness har saal taqriban kitney billion dollar lekar aata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states Guinness's annual turnover is *more than* 14.7 billion American dollars. Therefore, the closest answer choice is 14 billion dollars.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 9** - This refers to the 9,000-year lease, not the revenue.
*   **B: 250** - This refers to the number of years that have passed since the lease was signed, not the revenue.
*   **D: 10** - This is the turnover in *euros*, while the question asks for the amount in *dollars*. The text specifically mentions 14.7 billion *American dollars*."
European Union key kitney mamalik mein H5N1 virus ki shanaakht hui hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Saat (Seven)**.

The text states: ""Austriya, germani, slovenia, belgharia, yunaan aur Itly key baad; france iss wires mein mubtala europi union kaa saatwaan mulk hay."" (Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Belgium, Greece and Italy, after which France is the seventh country in the European Union affected by this virus.)

Therefore, H5N1 has been identified in seven European Union countries."
H5N1 virus ka shanaakht kardah aakhiri case kahaan thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage states: ""Insaanon keliye mohlik bird flow h5n1 kee tasdiq peer ko france key mashriq mein waaqa leone key qareeb nashebi elaqah mein mutissirah jangli batakh kee maut say huyee hay."" This translates to: ""The dangerous for humans bird flu H5N1 was confirmed this week in France, in the east near Wacquemotte, following the death of a wild duck.""

Therefore, France is where the most recently confirmed case of H5N1 was identified.



"
Aman key daston ki wajah sey failao sey pahley Haaiti ka aakhiri baar bimaari sey saamna kabb hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ki dahaai mein (1800s)**.

The text states: ""Daston kee aamad say qabal, heaty ko attharvein sadee say bemari say mutalliq masail kaa saamna nahein huwa thaa."" which translates to ""Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not faced disease-related issues since the 18th century.""  ""Attharveen sadee"" means the 18th century, or the 1800s.



"
Kiss jagah ki gandagi ney beemari key failao mein taawun kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Artibonite daryaa (Artibonite River)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*jis kee wajah say heaty kee sab say bary artibo neat nadi kee shaakh mein jaraseem daakhil hogaye*."" ( ""...due to which germs entered the branch of the Artibonite River, Haiti's largest."")

This directly links the spread of the disease to contamination of the Artibonite River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: UN key derey (UN camps):** While the UN peacekeepers were *accused* of introducing the disease, the passage says the *result* of inadequate sanitation in the camp led to the contamination of the river.
* **C: 2010 key zalzalah ki site (2010 earthquake site):** The earthquake created the conditions for needing aid, but it wasn't directly the source of the disease spread.
* **D: Insaaf aur jamhuriyt ka Haitian edarah (Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy):** This organization commissioned a study, it wasn't the place where the disease spread *from*.



"
Ireland ki hukumat kiya karney ki mansubah bandi karr rahi hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Manshiyaat key imkaan parr mazeed kadey qanoon ka taaruf karana (Introducing stricter laws regarding drug use)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The Irish government is urging parliament to legislate quickly to correct the legal situation regarding drugs. They are concerned about both public health and criminal justice.
* **The Minister of Health's statement:** Expresses concern about those benefiting from temporarily legalized drugs *and* the penalties imposed since the recent legal changes. This implies a desire to revisit and likely *strengthen* the laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manshiyaat key mujrimin keliye saza ki yaqeen dahaani karaney (Ensuring punishment for drug criminals):** While the Minister is concerned about penalties, the overall focus is on *correcting the legal situation* which suggests changing the laws, not just enforcing existing ones.
* **C: Manshiyaat key imkaan parr qanoon ki choot dena (Loosening the law regarding drug use):** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.  They want to *correct* a situation that involved temporary legalization.
* **D: Manshiyaat ko jurm sey baahar karnaa (Decriminalizing drugs):** The passage clearly indicates a concern about the legal status of drugs and the penalties associated with them, suggesting they *aren't* looking to remove them from being a crime.



"
Ireland mein aarzi tor parr konsi cheez qanooni thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Manshiyaat** (Drugs).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...unn afraad kee behbood kee nisbat say jo **aarizi tor say qanoonan mubaah kee gayee manshiyaat** say mustafid ho rahay hain..."" This directly translates to ""...the improvement of those individuals who are benefiting from **drugs that were temporarily legally permitted**...""

The passage discusses concerns regarding people benefitting from temporarily legalized drugs and the penalties related to those drugs. Therefore, the answer must be drugs (manshiyaat).



"
Mushtabah mujrim key liye kiss cheez ki tafteesh ki jaarahi thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Tajawuz karney (Assault/Aggression)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the police are investigating whether the alteration of the signs (""o"" changed to small ""e"") relates to a ""mushtabah mard janayat kaar"" (apparently a suspect) and ""toad phod"" (which translates to assault/aggression, often a euphemism for sexual assault in this context - though without further context, ""assault"" is the safest interpretation).  The key phrase is ""bataya keh mushtabah mard janayat kaar say dakhle beja nah keh toad phod key baaray mein taftish kee jaa rahee hay"" - ""told that investigation is being done regarding an unwanted entry/intrusion by a suspect and assault.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jismaani noqsaan (Physical Harm):** While assault *can* cause physical harm, the passage specifically points to the *act* of assault/aggression being investigated.
* **C: Guda gardi (Chaos/Disorder):** This doesn't fit the context of a criminal investigation related to altered signs and a suspect.
* **D: Chori (Theft):** The passage makes no mention of theft.



"
"Nishaani ko tabdil kartey waqt, mustabah ney kiya nahein kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Iska eek harf tabdil kar diya** (One letter was changed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...balkeh yeah tabdeeli """"o"""" ko badal karr chhote haraf """"e"""" ko padhnay key liye...""  This directly translates to ""...rather, this change was made by replacing the letter """"o"""" with the lowercase letter """"e""""...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aman ki nishaani key saath isey mozayyan kar diya** (It was identified with Aman's symbol) - The passage mentions ""aman aur dill kee alamaton"" (Aman and Dill's symbols) were *used to make the change*, not to *identify* the symbol itself.
* **C: Jismaani tor parr usey noqsaan kar diya** (It was physically damaged) - The passage specifically states: ""Alaamat ko jismani tor parr badla nahein gayaa thaa"" (The symbol was not physically changed).
* **D: Ismein tarmeem karney keliye tirpaalon ka istemaal karein** (Use tarpaulins to repair it) -  The passage says tarpaulins were used to *make* the change (to obscure/alter how the symbol was read), not to *repair* it.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiss parr angrezi key tutor Karno ney ilzaam nahein lagaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Haqqe tabaat ki khelaaf warzi (Violation of copyright)**.

Here's why:

The text states Karno was *accused* of copyright violation in the past, but was never convicted (""lekin uss say qeemat nahein lie gayee"").  Modern Education accused him of unauthorized advertising (C) and spreading false information about being the chief tutor. The former student explicitly stated he used ""bazaari zubaan"" (vulgar language) in class (D) and taught ""dating karnay kee maharaton"" (dating skills) (B).

Therefore, Karno wasn't accused *by anyone in the text* of copyright violation, only that he *faced an accusation* in the past that didn't lead to punishment.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Rolando Mendoza ney kisko bnadhak nahein banay thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Photographer**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the photographers were *released* along with the children and elderly. It also mentions they *replaced* a hostage who went to the restroom. This indicates they were not held hostage themselves. The text clearly states Rolando Mendoza targeted the *Hong Kong tourists* (sayyahon) and engaged with *police officials* (police ahalkaar) during the standoff. He also initially held *children* (bacchey) hostage.

Therefore, photographers were not made hostages."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kiss bandhak ki tasdiqu bator jaldi chooeney key nahein hui thee?","The correct answer is **A: Sayyah (Tourist)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Filpine key daarulhukumat maneela mein hong kong key sayyahon ko unn kee bus kaa aghwa kartay hoay yarghumal banaa lia hay."" This means *tourists from Hong Kong* were the initial hostages. However, the text then specifically mentions that *photographers* replaced some of the hostages, including an elderly woman who went to the restroom. The text explicitly states that the *photographers* and *children* were released quickly.

The question asks which hostage group's *release was not confirmed quickly*. While the release of photographers and children IS confirmed quickly, the text doesn't explicitly say *when* the tourists were released (if at all). There are reports of casualties among the tourists, which suggests they were not all released quickly like the other groups.

Therefore, the text confirms quick releases for:

*   **Boodha (Elderly woman - replaced by photographers)**
*   **Photographer**
*   **Bachey (Children)**

But *not* for the **Sayyah (Tourists)** as a whole.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Brazil mein hamjins ki shaadi ki himaayat mein dastakhat ekattha kon kar rahaa thsaa?","The correct answer is **A: Mozahereen (Protesters)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Muzahireen nay ummid jatayi hay keh november mein national congress key saamney arzi dayer karnay ke liye unn key paas 1.2 millin darkhwastein jamma hojayein gee."" (Protesters are hoping to submit 1.2 million signatures to the national congress in November).  This directly indicates that protesters are collecting signatures in support of same-sex marriage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is currently holding the draft bill, but not collecting signatures.
*   **C: Unani Catholic Church:** The text explicitly states the church *opposes* legalizing same-sex marriage.
*   **D: Marta farahamahi:** She drafted the original bill but is not mentioned as currently collecting signatures.



"
Mozahereen ney apni pettion kisko di thee,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil ki qomi Congress**.

The passage states: ""Muzahireen nay ummid jatayi hay keh november mein national congress key saamney arzi dayer karnay ke liye unn key paas 1.2 millin darkhwastein jamma hojayein gee."" (Protesters hope to submit 1.2 million requests to the national congress in November.)

Therefore, the protesters are submitting their petition to the Brazil's national congress.



"
"Armand warsi key hisaab sey, bheed key mosam ka radde amal shuru karney sey pahley kiya hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Tez hawayein theen** (Strong winds were present).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Display mein paanch mint dekhnay key baad hawa andar daakhil honey lagi, eek minut baad hawa 70kilometer/ghantah kee raftaar say hawa pahunchnay lagi...""  This directly translates to ""After watching the display for five minutes, wind started entering, after one minute the wind reached 70 kilometers/hour.""

This happened *before* the heavy rain, the painful hail, and the panic.  Therefore, the strong winds were the first significant event Armand Warsi observed as the storm began.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zalah baari shuru hogayi thee** (Heavy rain started) - The rain came *after* the strong winds.
*   **B: Display paanch minat pichey chal raha thaa** (The display was running five minutes behind) - This is a detail about the display, not an event related to the storm's onset.
*   **D: Wohh khandaan key eek rukn ka suraag kho diya thaa** (He lost track of a family member) - Armand only mentions losing his sister and her friend *during* the chaos, not beforehand.



"
"Warsi key hisaab sey, sabsey tez hawayein kabb shurru huein?","The correct answer is **A: Display key shuru honay key kuch minat baad**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Display mein paanch mint dekhnay key baad hawa andar daakhil honey lagi, eek minut baad hawa 70kilometer/ghantah kee raftaar say hawa pahunchnay lagi...""  This directly translates to ""After watching the display for five minutes, wind started entering, after one minute the wind reached 70 kilometers/hour...""

Therefore, the strongest winds began shortly *after* the display started being watched.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Barish key baad** - The winds started *before* the rain.
*   **C: Uskey apni bahan ko kho deney key baad** - Losing his sister happened *after* the winds and rain started.
*   **D: Zalah baari sey pahley** - ""Zalah baari"" (hail) started *after* the winds and rain.



"
"Fred sey pahley, 35°W key mashriq mein kitney baday toofan record kiye gaye hein?","The correct answer is **B: Teen**.

The text states: ""Freed...yeah 35 deg dabliyo key mashriq mein abb tak key record kaa **teesra** badaa samundari toofan hay..."" This directly translates to ""Freed...is the **third** largest hurricane on record east of 35°W.""  If Freed is the *third* largest, that means two others were recorded before him.
"
"Jabb Fred Cape Verde jazeeron key paas waqea hua thaa, kiss samt mein yeah chal rahaa thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Shumaal maghrib** (Northwest).

The text states: ""Freed...is traveling towards the northwest."" This directly answers the question of which direction Fred was heading when near the Cape Verde islands."
Darjah zail mein sey kiski apney pesh rowon key moqabiley ziyadah tez raftaarein theen?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""802.11n raftaar maqool hadd tak apnay pesh row key muqabilay tez hay"" (802.11n speed is considerably faster than its predecessors).  It then goes on to mention a theoretical throughput of 600mbit/s. The other options (802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g) are mentioned as being *predecessors* to 802.11n, implying 802.11n is faster.
"
802.11b sey hamm aahang pichla honey key liye 802.11n ki khaatir kiya zaruri hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dohrey radioz**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah 802.11a, 802.11b our 802.11g key saath peeche kee taraf mutabiqat pazeer honey kee sahulat day gaa **bashartekeh iss base station mein dohra radio ho**.""  (It will facilitate backward compatibility with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g **provided the base station has dual radio**.)

To support older standards like 802.11b while also operating on the 5GHz band (and achieving the faster speeds of 802.11n), the base station *needs* to have two radios – one for the 2.4GHz band (for backward compatibility) and one for the 5GHz band.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ahmiyat key saath ziyadah tez raftaarein (Significantly faster speeds):** While 802.11n *is* faster, faster speeds aren't *required* for backwards compatibility.
*   **B: 802.11b keliye 5.0Ghz parr kaam karney ki salahiyat (Ability to work on 5.0GHz for 802.11b):**  802.11b operates on 2.4GHz, not 5GHz.
*   **C: 600Mbit/s ka eek thropat (A throughput of 600Mbit/s):** This is the *potential* speed of 802.11n, but not a requirement for compatibility with older standards.



"
Commonwealth khelon mein tairaaki ki wajah sey kitni taqribaat mein Olympic gold medal paaney waley thay?,"The correct answer is **B: Teen**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Olympic gold medalist **dolat mushtarikah khelon key teen railay** aur 100 meter aur 200 meter free style mein tairnay waale they..."" This directly translates to: ""Olympic gold medalist **three competitors** in the Commonwealth Games and swam in 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle.""

Therefore, the answer is three."
Olympic gold medal haasil karney walaa apney dard keliye dawa keon nahein ley raha thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Usko tashweesh thee kehh iss sey uski fitness parr manfi asar padey gaa** (He was worried it would negatively affect his fitness).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...*lekin inn kee shikayaton kee wajah say inn kee sehat mashkok ho gayee. woh unn dawaon ko leenay key qaabil nahein jinn ko usay dard key ezalah key liye lena chahiye kiyon keh woh dawayein inn khelon key doraan mamnua hain.*"" This translates to ""...but due to his complaints, his health was suspect. He was not able to take the medicine he needed for pain relief because those medicines were prohibited during the games.""

This clearly indicates the athlete *needed* pain medication, but couldn't take it because it was banned and he feared it would impact his performance/fitness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usko koyi dard nahein hua thaa** (He didn't have any pain) - The passage directly contradicts this, mentioning his *shikayatein* (complaints) and need for pain relief.
* **B: Iss sey wohh beemar padd gaya thaa** (It made him sick) - The passage doesn't say the medication made him sick, only that he couldn't *take* it.
* **D: Commonwealth khelon mein Iski ijaazat nahein hay** (It is not allowed in the Commonwealth Games) - The passage specifically mentions the *Olympic* games and the rules *during the games*, not the Commonwealth Games.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zalzalah ki sargarmi key baarey mein confusion ka keya baes hua hogaa?","The correct answer is **A: Kaaley badalon ki mojudgi (The presence of black clouds)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pahaad key daaman mein kisee aatish fashani srgarmi say gair mutalliqah gehrey baadlon kee ettelaa di gayee. Baadlon nay uljhan kaa imkaan paida kardiya keh aaya waaqaee aatish fashaan phat padaa thaa.""  This translates to: ""Reports of deep, dark clouds were given in the foothills, unrelated to any volcanic activity. The clouds created confusion as to whether the volcano had actually erupted.""

The confusion about the volcanic activity (and potentially a related earthquake) stemmed from the presence of these unrelated dark clouds, making it unclear if an eruption had occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iceland ki Meteorological office ki ittelaat (Information from Iceland's Meteorological Office):** The office *didn't* report any activity; it's the *lack* of information that's mentioned, not the information itself causing confusion.
*   **C: Aalami zalzalah ka naqshah (Global earthquake map):** The map showed no activity, so it clarified rather than caused confusion.
*   **D: Iceland key deegar elaqon mein ittelaa di gayi sargarmi (Activity reported in other areas of Iceland):** The passage only discusses activity near the volcano, not elsewhere in Iceland."
Ebarat key hisaab sey marhalay ki tabdili kabb waqea hui thee?,"The correct answer is **C: 10 march ko**.

The text states: ""Zalzalay kee ahem srgarmi jis key baes marhalay mein tabdeeli kee gayee thee, woh 10 march ko aatish fashaan key sarbarahi ijlaas caledra key shumaal mashriq kee jaanib mein waaqa huyee thee.""  This directly translates to ""The significant seismic activity that caused a stage change occurred on March 10th to the northeast of the Fagradalsfjall volcanic caldera.""



"
Chandrayaan-1 key qamari prob key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Prob ko launch karney waley madaar mein eek amalah thaa** (There was a crew in the orbit launching the probe).

Here's why:

The passage states that Chandrayaan-1 *deployed* (kharīj kiya) its moon impact probe. It doesn't mention a crew being involved in the launch/deployment from orbit.  It was an automated process.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

* **B: Prob mein ahem aalaat shaamil they** (The probe included important instruments) - The passage explicitly says ""Teen ahem sciency aalat ko laadnay key saath..."" (With three important scientific instruments...)
* **C: Prob ka ikhraaj kamiyaab thaa** (The probe's deployment was successful) - The passage states ""...kamiyabi say utar gayaa"" (...landed successfully).
* **D: Prob ki samton ko paint kiya gaya thaa** (The probe's surfaces were painted) - The passage says ""...chand key qomi parcham ko paint kiya gayaa thaa"" (...the national flag was painted).  This refers to the probe being painted.



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr qamari prob ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isney chaand key shumaali pole key paas lend kiya thaa** (It landed near the north pole of the moon).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""chand key jonubi qutub key qareeb kamiyabi say utar gayaa"" (it landed successfully near the *south* pole of the moon).  Option A contradicts this directly.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the passage:

* **B: lend kartey huey iski takkar kamiyaab thee** (Its impact was successful during landing) - The passage says ""kamiyabi say utar gayaa"" (landed successfully).
* **C: Iska eek insaani madaar sey ikhraaj kar liya gaya thaa** (It was ejected from a human orbit) - The passage states ""Gair insaan bardaar"" (non-human carrying) implying it was launched from an unmanned mission.
* **D: Yeah do ahem aalaat lekar jaa raha thaa** (It was carrying two important instruments) - The passage says ""Teen ahem sciency aalat ko laadnay key saath"" (carrying three important scientific instruments).  While it says *three*, the statement ""two"" isn't a direct contradiction like landing on the wrong pole.



Therefore, **A** is the only statement demonstrably false according to the provided text."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, beemari sey tahaffuz ka konsa paimanah akhir mein naafiz kiya jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **C: Encephalitis vaccines**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hukumat nay encephalitis key kayee million vaccine bananay kaa waadah kiya hay, jo aglay saal kee tayyari mein health agencies kee madad karein gay."" (The government has promised to make millions of encephalitis vaccines, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.)

While the passage mentions other measures like catching pigs, distributing mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides, the *final* measure being implemented for protection is the production and distribution of the vaccine.  The others are preventative or reactive, but the vaccine is the direct protection *against* the disease.



"
Beemari inssanon tak kaisey muntaqil hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Machhar** (Mosquitoes).

The passage states: ""Yeah marz pehle suwar mein paida hota hay phir **machhar** uss ko insaanon ko muntaqil kartay hain."" (This disease first originates in pigs, then **mosquitoes** transmit it to humans.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Keedey maar adviyaat** (Insecticides) - These are used to *control* the spread, not *transmit* the disease.
* **C: Suwarein** (Pigs) - Pigs are the *source* of the disease, but not how it reaches humans.
* **D: Suwar pakadney waley** (Pig catchers) - They are a response to the disease, not the method of transmission.



"
Doosrey jumlah ki nakaami kiss natijah ka baes ho sakti thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Hamm jins samaji jaaton ka mustaqbil ka haque (The future right of same-sex couples)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dosray jumley kee nakami, jo ham jinsi civil uninon parr pabandi aayed karnay kee tajweez pesh karta hay, mumkenah tor parr mustaqabil mein civil uninon keliye darwazay khol sakta hay.""  This translates to: ""The failure of the second clause, which proposed to impose restrictions on same-sex civil unions, could possibly open doors for civil unions in the future.""

Therefore, the failure of the second clause could lead to future rights for same-sex couples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: HJR-3 ka fauri jayezah (Immediate review of HJR-3):** While HJR-3 *will* be reviewed later, the immediate consequence of the clause's failure isn't a review, but the *potential* for future rights.
*   **C: Eek fauri qanoon saazi ka session (An immediate legislative session):** The passage doesn't suggest an immediate new session.
*   **D: Hamm jins samaji jaaton ki mamnuyiat (Prohibition of same-sex couples):** The failure of the clause goes *against* prohibition; it opens possibilities.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, doosrey jumlah ko kabb hazaf kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Qanoon saazi key session key doraan** (During the legislative session).

The text states: ""Iss qanoon saazi key session mein uss waqat eek tabdeeli runuma hoyee jab dosray jumley ko pehle aiwani numaindagaan kee jaanib say hazaf kiya gayaa..."" This directly translates to ""During this legislative session, a change occurred when the second clause was removed by the House of Representatives...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2011 mein** - While the overall bill passed in 2011, the removal of the second clause happened *during* the session, not necessarily in 2011 specifically.
* **C: Somwaar ko** - The text doesn't mention any day of the week.
* **D: 2015 mein** - 2015 is when the remaining part of the bill will be reviewed, not when the clause was removed.



"
Kiskey samney “Panama Papers” leak kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Press**.

The text states: ""taqriban das lakh dastawezaat ... jinhein 2016 key mausam bahaar mein **press** mein leak kiya gayaa thaa."" (approximately ten lakh documents... which were leaked to the **press** in the spring of 2016).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mossack Fonseca campany:** The papers *belonged* to Mossack Fonseca, but they weren't leaked *to* the company.
*   **C: Deutsche Bank:** While Deutsche Bank was involved as mentioned in the text, the leak wasn't *to* them.
*   **D: Iceland ki hukumat key sarbaraah:**  The text mentions the Icelandic Prime Minister resigned *as a result* of the papers, but the leak wasn't directly *to* them.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiskey baarey mein bartanavi press ka dawaa thaa kehh wohh dolat chupaney keliye istemaal honay waali bahut see companiyon ka bando bast kar raha thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bartanvi akhbaar the gargian nay kahaa keh aisa karnay waali 1200 sell companion key eek tehayi ko doiche bank control karta thaa.""  This translates to ""The British newspaper The Guardian said that one-third of the 1200 shell companies doing this were controlled by Deutsche Bank.""

Therefore, the British press claimed Deutsche Bank was controlling many of the companies used for hiding wealth.



"
Darjah zail konsey sayyarah haadsah mein sabsey ziyadah halakatein hui theen,"The correct answer is **A: Iran sey Armenia jarahey sayyarah ka rastah mein tasaadum** (The plane crash on the route from Iran to Armenia).

The passage states: ""Guzashta mahinay iraan mein pichlay kayee salon kaa sab say almanaak hawai haadsah pesh aaya jab 168 logon ko arminia lay karr jaaney waala hawai jahaaz haadise kaa shikaar ho gayaa."" (Last month, the most tragic air crash in Iran in many years occurred when a plane carrying 168 people crashed while traveling to Armenia.) This crash resulted in the highest number of fatalities (168).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Police helicopter ka tasaadum** (Police helicopter crash): This resulted in 3 deaths.
*   **C: Armenia sey Iran janey waley sayyarah ka rastah mein tasaadum** (Crash on the route from Armenia to Iran): The passage describes a flight *from* Iran *to* Armenia.
*   **D: Mashhad mein sayyarah ka tasaadum** (Crash in Mashhad): This resulted in 17 deaths, fewer than the Armenia-bound plane crash.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Iran mein waqea honany waaley fazaayi hadsaat ki bohtaat ki wajah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Naye sayyaron ki kharidaariyon ki ijaazat deney waley bajat ki kami** (Lack of budget to allow purchasing new aircraft).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states international sanctions prevent Iran from *buying* new aircraft.** It doesn't mention a lack of *budget* as the reason they can't buy them, only that the sanctions are the barrier.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reasons for the air accidents:

* **A: Shahri aur foji sayyron ka purana fleet** (Old civilian and military fleets) - The passage directly says Iran has ""old aircraft.""
* **C: Pabandiyaan jo naye sayyaron ki kharidaariyon sey baaz rakhti hein** (Sanctions preventing the purchase of new aircraft) -  This is explicitly stated as a problem.
* **D: Sayyron ki kharaab tariqah sey dekh bhaal ki jaaney waali fleet** (Poorly maintained fleets) - The passage says maintenance is not done well for both civilian and military aircraft.

Therefore, the only option not supported by the text is a lack of budget, as the issue is sanctions, not funding.



"
Iraq ki tahqiqi jaat ki report mein darjah zail mein sey kisko shaamill nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Yeah elaan kehh kuchh tadiliyon key saath, Iraq mein badhtey huey tashaddud sey bacha ja skata hay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the report warns **""koyee bhee guarantee nahein day sakta keh iraaq mein iss noqtah parr koyee bhee khuttah amal taaifi jang, mutnami unf, yaa aam khalfashar ko rok sakta hay""** (no guarantee can be given that any course of action can prevent sectarian violence, civil war, or widespread chaos in Iraq).  This directly contradicts option B, which claims the report announced that violence *could* be averted with modifications.

Let's look at why the other options *are* included in the report:

* **A: Mojudah policy ki tanqid (Criticism of current policy):**  The passage states the report ""noktah cheen hay...harr pehlu parr"" (is critical of every aspect) of the existing policy.
* **C: Iraq ki sarhadon ko mahfooz rakhney ki sifarishaat (Recommendations to secure Iraq's borders):** The first recommendation listed is specifically about securing the borders.
* **D: Ameriki ittefaaqe rayon ki darkhawast (Request for American consensus):** The report begins with an appeal for debate and consensus-building within the United States.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Iraq ki tahqiqi jamaat ki apni report mein nahein uthaya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeah kehh badhtey huey tashddud ko rokney ki garnatee ka elaan kiya jaye (That a guarantee to stop increasing violence will be announced)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the Iraq Study Group warned that **no guarantee can be given** that any action can prevent sectarian violence, civil war, or broader conflict in Iraq.  The question asks what wasn't *raised* in the report. Therefore, promising a guarantee to stop violence is the opposite of what the report said, and thus wasn't included as a point.

Let's look at why the other options *were* raised:

* **B: Hidaayat mein fauri tabdili (Immediate change in direction):** The passage says the report ""urges a swift change in direction.""
* **C: Khuli bahas ka istemaal (Use of open debate):** The report begins with an ""appeal for open debate and consensus building"" in US policy.
* **D: Nayi safarati pahal (New diplomatic initiative):** The first of 78 recommendations is to launch a new diplomatic initiative.



"
"Police key hisaab sey, kisko Provenzano ka dayan haath waala aadmi samjha jaata thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Police kaa kehna hay keh low picalo ko hee bartari haasil thee keunkeh woh palarmo mein pervenzano kaa daayan haath shumaar hota thaa**"" which translates to ""Police say that Lo Piccolo had superiority because he was considered Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Giovanni Falcone:** The passage mentions Falcone as someone Provenzano *claimed* to have killed, not as his associate.
*   **C: Ansa:** Ansa is mentioned at the beginning of the passage as the source of the information, not a person involved.
*   **D: Paolo Borsellino:** Similar to Falcone, Borsellino is mentioned as a victim allegedly targeted by Provenzano.



"
"Ebarat mein di gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Falcone ki maut ka sabab kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Usko saathi mafia jangaju Lo Piccolo ney qatal kar diya thaa** (He was killed by fellow mafia warrior Lo Piccolo).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...aur 1992 mein maafiya key saleebi jewani falcon aur pawlo borcelino ko halaak karnay daawa kiya thaa."" ( ""...and in 1992, mafia warrior Falcone and Paolo Borcelino were claimed to have been destroyed"").  It further states that Lo Piccolo was considered Provenzano’s right hand, and Provenzano was involved in ending the war against the state and claiming responsibility for Falcone and Borcelino's deaths.  This implies Lo Piccolo was involved in the killings, acting under Provenzano.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh Rina ki bhadkayi jang mein qatal kar diya gaya thaa** (He was killed in a war instigated by Rina) - While the text mentions a war against the state, it doesn't specifically say Falcone died *in* that war, nor does it emphasize Rina's instigation.
*   **B: Usey police ney qatal diya thaa** (He was killed by the police) - The passage explicitly points to the mafia as responsible.
*   **C: Lo Piccolo ko usey qatal karney ka hukum mila thaa** (Lo Piccolo was ordered to kill him) - The passage doesn't state an order was given, but implies Lo Piccolo was an active participant in the actions of Provenzano, who took responsibility for the deaths.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Hitoshi Saito ki taarifein nahein hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Do baar ka Olympic gold medal haasil karney waala**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hitoshi Saito was an Olympic gold medalist (not a *two-time* gold medalist). It *doesn't* specify he won multiple gold medals.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the text:

*   **A: Do baar ka aalami Champion** - The passage states he was a former world champion (aalimi champion).
*   **B: Tamaam Japan key Judo Federation ka cCommittee chairman** - The passage explicitly mentions he was the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee.
*   **D: Judo ka maahir** - Being an Olympic and world champion automatically implies he was a Judo expert (maahir).



"
Iwasaki halaf leney sey kahaan bach sakaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The passage states: ""nepal mein shaadi karnay say bach gayaa"" which translates to ""he escaped from getting married in Nepal."" 

Therefore, Iwasaki escaped *from* Nepal."
Kisney Iwasaki parr hamlah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek kutta** (A dog).

The passage states: ""eek dabang kuttay nay tibbat mein uss parr hamlah kiyaa"" which translates to ""a fierce dog attacked him in Tibet.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uski mumkanah biwi** (His possible wife) - The passage says he *avoided* marrying in Nepal, not that his possible wife attacked him.
* **B: Qazzaaq** (Qazaqs) - They looted him, they didn't attack *him* directly.
* **D: Police** - He was arrested by the police in India, not attacked.



"
Alonso ney apni daud kabb khatam ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Schumacher key apni daud khatam karney key baad**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael shomashir nay apni rees aalonso key kuchh der baad hee khatam karr di..."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Schumacher key uskey agley pahiyah ko noqsaan pahuchaney key baad** - While Schumacher's wheel *caused* Alonso to stop, the text doesn't say Alonso finished *after* the damage.
*   **B: Fisichella ka apney car parr control kho gaya thaa** - This refers to Jaine Carlo Faisi Shila, not Alonso.
*   **D: Badhat leney key baad** - The text doesn't mention Alonso ""taking the lead.""



"
Kiss wajah sey Schumacher ney apni daud jaldi khatam kar di thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Car key bekaar honay tak ka noqsaan** (Damage to the car until it became unusable).

Here's why:

The text states ""Michael Schumacher ney apni rees aalonso key kuchh der baad hee khatam karr di, race key doraan mutaddid muqabilon mein moattli key khasarah kee wajah say."" This translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, due to damage from multiple collisions during the race.""  This indicates the car sustained damage that forced him to retire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Usney apni car ka control kho diya thaa** (He lost control of his car) - While Jaine Carlo Fasi Shila lost control, this isn't stated about Schumacher.
*   **B: Alonso key saath tasaadum** (Collision with Alonso) - Schumacher finished *after* Alonso, and the text says the damage was from *multiple* collisions.
*   **C: Fisichella ki wajah sey pahiyah ka noqsaan** (Wheel damage due to Fisichella) - The text mentions Fisichella caused a wheel issue for *Alonso*, not Schumacher.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, giraftaaron keliye zamaanat karana kiska kaam thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Adalat ka commissioner (The court commissioner)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Commissioner Bill tartib deta hay agar manzoor hojaye aur giraftar kiye jaaney waale afsar kee jaanib say dayer kiye gaye elzamaat ko baqayedah shakal deta hay.""  This means the commissioner sets bail *if approved* and formally outlines the charges filed by the arresting officer. The passage also mentions the commissioner sets a date for a speedy hearing on the charges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Giraftaar kaney waala afsar (Arresting officer):** The arresting officer *files* the charges, but the commissioner *sets* the bail and outlines the charges.
* **B: Judge Glynn:** Judge Glynn issued a restraining order *against* the central booking facility, preventing them from releasing people without bail, but didn't directly set the bail.
* **C: Markazi book karney ki sohulat (Central booking facility):**  The central booking facility was *affected* by the situation, and was releasing people improperly, but didn't set the bail.



"
"Ebarat mein mazkoor aarzia pabandi waaley hukum key hisaab sey, giraftaar shudgaan ko 24 ghanton sey ziyadah qaid mein rahney keliye keya rakhney ki ijaazat honaa zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **D: Samaat (Bail)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the temporary restraining order issued by Judge Glynn concerned individuals ""released without posting bail"" who were held for over 24 hours and had not had bail set by a court commissioner.  This clearly indicates that *posting bail* is the requirement for being held longer than 24 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zamaanat (Bail)** - While this translates to bail, it's not what the order *requires* to be done. It's the *lack* of bail that triggers the release.
* **B: Giraftaar karney waley afsar sey mulaqaat (Meeting with the arresting officer)** - The passage mentions charges being formalized by the officer, but a meeting isn't the critical factor for continued detention.
* **C: Judge Glynn ki taraf sey jaari kardah rasmi charge (Formal charge issued by Judge Glynn)** - The order concerns *lack* of bail set by a commissioner, not charges issued by the judge.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, mansukh shudah runoff ki wazahat karne keliye kaun si wajah ka istemaal nahein hua tha?","The correct answer is **B: Dastur ka eek tazaad** (A conflict with the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage states that *previous* reports said canceling a runoff election would *violate* the constitution (""mutzad hay jinn mein kahaa gayaa thaa kehh dobarah intekhabat ko mansukh karnaa dastur key monafi hota"").  However, the current decision is based on ambiguities *within* the constitution (""afghan dastur mein itnay ibhamaat hain kehh run off election kee nobat nahein aayey gee"").

The passage *specifically* mentions security threats (Salamati ke Khatraat) and high costs (Ziyada ikhrajaat) as reasons given for the cancellation.  It also mentions constitutional ambiguities (Dasturi ibhaam) as the diplomats' rationale. 

Therefore, the *lack* of a conflict with the constitution (Dastur ka eek tazaad) is what the text indicates wasn’t used to justify the cancellation – in fact, previous reports suggested the opposite.



"
Akhir kaar diplomats runoff ko gair zarury keon samajhte they?,"The correct answer is **C: Dastur mein ibhaam thaa** (There were ambiguities in the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diplomats kaa kehna hay unn kee nazar mein afghan dastur mein itnay ibhamaat hain kehh run off election kee nobat nahein aayey gee."" (Diplomats say in their view there are so many ambiguities in the Afghan constitution that a runoff election will not come about).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yehh dastur ke khilaaf thaa** (It was against the constitution) - While the passage mentions previous reports said a cancellation would *violate* the constitution, it doesn't say the diplomats believed the runoff itself was unconstitutional, but rather that ambiguities *prevented* a runoff.
*   **B: Salamati ke khtraat they** (There were security threats) - The passage mentions security threats as *one* reason for considering cancellation, but the primary reason given for the diplomats' view is the constitutional ambiguity.
*   **D: intekhab bahut menhga thaa** (The election was very expensive) - The passage mentions the cost of the election, but doesn't state that this was the diplomats' reasoning.



"
Faata keliye adalati khidmaat kon faraham karata hey?,"The correct answer is **B: Seyasi agents**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah agent hazraat pakistani qanoon key article number 247 key taht hukumati aur adalati khidmaat farahim karnay key zimme daar hain."" (These agents are responsible for providing governmental and judicial services under Article 247 of Pakistani law).

Therefore, the *seyasi agents* are the ones providing judicial services in FATA.



"
Faata key “seyasi agents” key barey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach nahi hey?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh pakistan ke dastur ke paband they (They were bound by the constitution of Pakistan)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the Political Agents operate under Article 247 of the Pakistani law. However, Article 247 *exempts* FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas) from the direct application of the Pakistani Constitution.  This means the Political Agents operated largely *outside* the direct constraints of the constitution. They had a system of governance based on tribal customs and the laws specifically applicable to FATA, not the full Pakistani Constitution.

Let's look at why the other options are true, based on the passage:

* **A: Wohh adalati khidmaat faraham kartey hein (They provide judicial services):** The passage states they are responsible for ""hukumati aur adalati khidmaat"" (governmental and judicial services).
* **B: Pakistani sadar ney unka intekhab nahein kiya thaa (The President of Pakistan did not elect them):** The passage says the President *appointed* them (""muqarrar kiye hain""). Appointment isn’t the same as election.
* **D: Wohh makhsus elaqay mein mokammal control rakhte hein (They have complete control in the special area):** The passage states they have ""taqriban mokammal khudmukhtar control"" (almost complete autonomous control).



Therefore, the statement that they were bound by the Pakistani constitution is the inaccurate one."
Kis award keyliye Emma Stone ko namzad kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Behtareen adakarah**.

The text states: ""Gosling aur stone bittarteeb behtareen adakaar aur adakarah keliye namzad hoay."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively."" Since the question asks about Emma Stone's nomination, and she was nominated as ""adakarah"" (actress), the answer is Best Actress."
Iss film ko kon sey award ke liye namzad nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Behtreen visual effects**.

The text lists all the categories the film was nominated for:

*   Best Actor (Gosling)
*   Best Actress (Stone)
*   Best Picture
*   Director
*   Cinematography
*   Costume Design
*   Film Editing
*   Original Score
*   Production Design
*   Sound Editing
*   Sound Mixing
*   Original Screenplay
*   Best Original Song (two songs specifically named)

Visual effects are **not** mentioned in the list of nominations. Therefore, it's the category the film was not nominated for."
Darjahg zail mein sey konsa zalzalah ke baad eperation mein bacha rahh gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Niigata mein eek power plant** (A power plant in Niigata).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N H key nay yeah bhee report kiya kehh nayee gaata parry facture mein qayem kashiwazaki kariwa nuclear power plant mamool key andaaz mein kam karraha thaa.""  This translates to ""It was also reported that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata prefecture was operating normally.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hokuriku key Sheeka plant mein tamaam reactors** - The passage specifically states the Sheeka plant's reactors 1 & 2 were *shut down*.
*   **B: Isheeka kaa airport** - The passage states the area around Ishikawa airport was *closed*.
*   **C: Railway ki tamaam khidmat** - The passage says railway service was *disrupted*.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey konsey zalzalah ki wajah sey noqsan sey bach gaye they?","The correct answer is **B: Sheeka plant mein do reactors** (Two reactors at the Sheeka plant).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hoko recoalectric power corporation nay zalzalah say kisee tarah key noqsan kee ittelaa nahein di hay aur yeah kehh sheeka johri plant key number 1 aur 2 reactor ko band karr diyaa gayaa hay.""  This translates to: ""Hoko Recoalectric Power Corporation has not reported any damage from the earthquake and stated that reactors number 1 and 2 at the Sheeka Johri plant have been shut down.""

Shutting down the reactors was a *precautionary* measure *because* no damage was reported.  Therefore, the reactors themselves were not damaged by the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kuchh makanaat (some houses)** - The text says 9400 homes are *without water*, implying damage or disruption.
*   **C: kuchh sadkein (some roads)** - The text states ""Kuchh sadkon ko noqsan pahunch chukaa hay"" - some roads *were damaged*.
*   **D: Naato airport (Nato airport)** - The text states the area around Nato airport is *closed*.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, darjah zial konsa masalah dastavez mein shamil nahein hey?","The correct answer is **B: 1967 key jang ki wajah** (The reason for the 1967 war).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the document will refer to border disputes *based on* the borders before the 1967 war.** It discusses the *result* of the war in defining borders, but not the *cause* of the war itself.
* **Yarroshlam ka mustaqbil** (The future of Jerusalem) is explicitly mentioned as being included in the negotiations.
* **Waadi mein fauji maujoodgi** (Military presence in the valley) is a central point of contention - Israel wants 10 years, Palestinians want 5.
* **Sarhadon parr tanazo** (Border disputes) is the overall subject of the document.

Therefore, the reason *why* the 1967 war happened is not a topic addressed in the document as described.



"
Darjah zial mein sey konsa falastin ka motalebah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jordan ki waadi mein jari fauji maujoodgi** (Continued military presence in the Jordan Valley).

Here's why:

The text states Israel wants a 10-year military presence in the valley, while Palestinians only agree to 5 years. This highlights a *disagreement* on the duration of the presence, not a Palestinian demand *for* a continued presence.  Palestinians are, in fact, trying to *limit* the duration.

Let's look at why the other options are Palestinian demands mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Jang sey pahle ki suratehalaat parr mabni sarhadein** (Borders based on the pre-war situation): The text explicitly states the document will refer to borders based on the situation before the 1967 Middle Eastern war.
*   **C: Yarroshalam key mustaqbil ke hawale sey jawabaat** (Responses regarding the future of Jerusalem): The text mentions the future status of Jerusalem as part of the issues to be addressed.
*   **D: Jordan ki waadi mein paanch salah fauji maujoodgi** (Five-year military presence in the Jordan Valley): This is exactly what the Palestinians are proposing.



"
Maa ney kiss mulk mein qanoon ki padhayee ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hong kong mein paida honey waale maa nay **new york university aur harward key school baraye qanoon mein taleem haasil kee**..."" which translates to ""The mother born in Hong Kong received education in New York University and Harvard's school for law...""  Both of these universities are in the **Amerika** (America/United States).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cheen (China):** While the mother has ties to the Chinese mainland, the text specifies she studied law *outside* of China.
* **C: Australia:** The text doesn't mention Australia.
* **D: Hong Kong:**  She was *born* in Hong Kong, but received her legal education elsewhere.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, Maa ki intekhabi jeet mein kiss mulk keliye wakalat moavin bani thee?","The correct answer is **D: Cheen (China)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inn elzamaat key bawajood, maa nay asl cheeni sarzamin key saath qareebi talluqat kee wakalat karnay waale eek plate form parr aasani say kamiyabi haasil kee.""  This translates to: ""Despite these accusations, Maa easily succeeded on a platform advocating for close ties with the original Chinese mainland.""

This clearly indicates that Maa represented interests related to mainland China in the election.



"
"Ebarat ke bayaniyah key motabiq, Carolyn Wilson ney shahar chorney se pahle kiss keyliye kaam kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*unke kirayedaaron ney apnay saath honey waale waaqiaat share karna shuroo kiya, to uss key shikaar beshtar khandaanon ko achanak ehsaas huwa kehh oha key kirolan walasan ney unn key scurity deposit chori karr liye hain, aur shehar chhod karr faraar ho gayaa hay.*"" 

This translates to: ""...when tenants began to share their experiences, more and more families suddenly realized that Carolyn Wilson of OHA had stolen their security deposits and fled the city.""

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA before leaving the city.



"
Season ki baqi chaar race key saath Drivers Championship key chauthey maqaam parr kon thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kahne**.

Here's how we can determine that from the text:

*   The text states ""Teesre mein, hemlin bees points peeche hay, magar boyar kahnay say paanch points aagay hay..."" (Third, Hamlin is twenty points behind, but five points ahead of Bowyer Kahne).
*   This means Kahne is in fourth place.

Therefore, the answer is Kahne."
"Ebarat mein mazkoor race key baad, drivers championship Kahne ke pass kitney points hein?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""junior aur trokes 2,220 aur 2,207 points key saath bittarteeb panchwen aur chhatti position parr hain.""  It also says ""hemlin bees points peeche hay, magar boyar kahnay say paanch points aagay hay"". Since Boyar is stated to be 2,220 points, Hemlin is 2,220 - 5 = 2,215. It then states that ""hemlin bees points peeche hay"" meaning Boyar has 2,215 + 25 = 2,240. However, the passage states that Johnson is second with 2,243 points. This contradicts the information given, but since the question asks specifically about the points that Kahne has, we must look to the passage for Boyar's points which are 2,220.

Therefore, Boyar (Kahnay) has 2,220 points."
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, keitni baar logon ney girtey hue shahaabe saqib ka moshahidah kiya hay jinkaa baad mein mirrikhi ulasal honaa sabit huey?","The correct answer is **B: Paanch baar**.

The passage states: ""Yeah tareekh kaa **panchwan baar** samjha jaataa hay kehh logon nay qamri aur mirrikhi mawaad ko zameen parr girtay hoay dekha..."" which translates to ""This is the **fifth time** it has been understood that people have seen lunar and meteorite materials falling to the ground...""

Therefore, people have observed falling meteorites confirmed to be of extraterrestrial origin five times."
"Jaisa ke ebarat mein mazkoor hey, sachh mein konsey patrhar hein jinka mirrikhi ul asal hona paya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Unmein sey 34 they**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zameen parr girnay waale taqriban 24,000 malum shahaabe saqib mein say sirf 34 key mirrikhi ulasal honey kee tasdiq hoyee hay.""  This translates to: ""Of the approximately 24,000 known meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to be of extraterrestrial origin.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tamaam July key shahaabe saqib ke phuwar ke dauraan mili thieen** (All were found during the July meteor shower) - While 15 are *from* the July shower, the passage doesn't say *all* 34 were found during it.
*   **B: Unmein sey 24,000 they** (There were 24,000 of them) -  The passage says 24,000 were *observed* falling, but only 34 were confirmed as meteorites.
*   **C: Unki qimat $11,000 soney sey ziyadah they** (Their price was more than $11,000 than gold) - The passage mentions the price of *some* meteorites, but not the 34 confirmed ones specifically, and the price is per ounce, not a total value.



"
Shomakar kab retired hue they ?,"The correct answer is **B: Apni satvein championship ki jeet key baad** (After winning his seventh championship).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Shomakar, jo saat baar farmulah 1 champion ship jeetnay key baad 2006 mein retired hoay..."" (Schumacher, who retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times...).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** Felip Massa's accident happened *after* Schumacher was already retired.
*   **C:** Schumacher was going to *replace* Massa, not retire after replacing him.
*   **D:** The passage says he retired in 2006, not at the end of the 2009 season."
Massa kab zakhmi hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek bade prix key badey prix key baad** (After a Grand Prix).

Here's why:

The passage states ""2009 key hungireen grand purse key doraan girnay say..."" which means Massa was injured *during* the Hungarian Grand Prix. This translates to ""after a Grand Prix"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Farmulah 1 champion ship jeetnay key baad** - The passage mentions Schumacher winning championships, but doesn't link it to Massa's injury.
*   **C: Shomakar key retire honey ke baad** - Schumacher's retirement is mentioned as background, but isn't *when* Massa was injured.
*   **D: 2009 season sey pahle** - The injury happened *during* the 2009 season, not before it."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nazmo nasq kaisey AOL ko motassir karega?","The correct answer is **C: AOL ke sarifeen ki tadaad ko Yahoo aur Microsoft key sarifeen ki hareef hogi** (AOL's users will compete with Yahoo and Microsoft's users).

Here's why:

The passage states that the combination of Yahoo! and Microsoft services will *match* the number of AOL users. This implies a competition for users – AOL's user base will be challenged and potentially diminished as people migrate to the combined Yahoo/Microsoft offerings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: AOL key sarifeen ki tadaad mumkinah taur parr barhh jaye gi** (AOL's user base might increase) - The passage suggests the opposite; it implies a potential *decrease* in users.
*   **B: AOL IM bazaar mein tanha taraqqi yaftah company hogi** (AOL will be the only developed company in the IM market) - This is false. Yahoo and Microsoft are significant players.
*   **D: AOL Amrika mein abb mazeed istemaal nahein hogi** (AOL will no longer be used in America) - The passage doesn't say AOL will stop being used, just that its dominance is threatened.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon naye nazmo nasq key baad khatm ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL ki apne maqam parr bazaar ko taraqqi deney ki aazadi (AOL's freedom to advance the market in its position)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Iss jagah Iss intezam key saath, yeah aazadi khatam hosakti hay"" (With this arrangement, this freedom could end).  The ""this freedom"" directly refers to AOL's previous success in driving and developing the market due to its large-scale use in the United States.  The passage implies that the combination of Yahoo and Microsoft will challenge AOL's dominance, potentially ending its freedom to control and advance the market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amerika mein internet key wase failao ki taraqqi (The progress of widespread internet dissemination in America):** The passage doesn't suggest the *progress* of the internet itself will end, just AOL's role in it.
* **B: IM bazaar ka istemaal (The use of the IM market):** The passage mentions the IM market being advanced, not its use being eliminated.
* **D: Yahoo aur microsoft ki aazadi (The freedom of Yahoo and Microsoft):**  The passage focuses on the potential *loss* of AOL's freedom, not the freedom of Yahoo and Microsoft.



"
Hamlah mein mare gaye kitney log police officer nahein they?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

* **Total killed:** 2 police officers
* **Total injured:** Over 20, including 19 police officers.
* **Therefore:** The number of injured who were *not* police officers is over 20 - 19 = 1.  The passage states ""do police afsaran halaak hogaye"" (two police officers were killed).  Since the total killed was only two, and they were both police officers, zero non-police officers were killed. 
* The question asks about *killed*, not injured.

The question is asking about the number of people who *died* who were not police officers.  Since only police officers died, the answer is 2. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 2**.
"
Hamlah mein mashkook mulzim ki kisney report ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Police**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Police nay kahaa kehh unn kaa shakk hay kehh iss hamlay kaa zimah daar daesh (ISIL) kaa mubbayyanah dehshatgird hay.""  This translates to ""Police said that they suspect the perpetrator of this attack is a Daesh (ISIL) affiliated terrorist.""  Therefore, the police reported the suspicion regarding the perpetrator.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Governor ki office** - The Governor's office reported the *number* of injured, specifically that 19 were police officers, but not who was suspected of carrying out the attack.
*   **C: Reporter** - The text doesn't mention a reporter making any report.
*   **D: ghazyan tape ke elaqayie log** - The text doesn't mention local people reporting on the suspect.



"
Florida ki jitne waley ki tamaam riyasat hay ki haysiyat ki wajah se Mitt Romney ko kiysa award diya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Riyasat key tamaam mandoobeen** (All of the state's delegates).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chookeh fateh ko tamaam riyasaton say muntakhab kiya jaataa hay, florida nay romani keliye apnay pachaas mandubin ko nawaza hay...""  This directly translates to ""Because the winner is selected from all states, Florida has awarded its fifty delegates to Romney..."" 

Therefore, Romney was awarded *all* of Florida's delegates due to his win.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: riyasat key 32 mandoobeen** (state's 32 delegates) - The text mentions 50 delegates, not 32.
*   **B: Republican Party ki namzadgi** (Republican Party nomination) - While the win *helps* him towards the nomination, it doesn't *award* him the nomination directly. He's described as a ""front runner"" - meaning leading candidate.
*   **D: 46 feesad vote** (46 percent vote) - This is the *percentage* of votes he received, not what he was awarded.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, kitnaa feesad vote Gingrich ko buniyaadi intekhab mein mley they?","The correct answer is **B: 32 feesad**.

The passage clearly states: ""Ameriki aiwane numaindgaan key saabiq speaker newt gangrech 32 feesad key saath dosray maqaam parr rahay."" (Former Speaker of the American House of Representatives Newt Gingrich was in second place with 32 percent.)"
"Ebarat key hisaab se, kaakas ke natayej ke baad kisney chalanaa jari nahein rakha thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""August mein aims straw poll jeetnay waali, beak man nay, apni muhim key ikhtetam kaa faislah karr lia."" (The one who won the aims straw poll in August, Bachmann, decided to end her campaign.)

This directly means Bachmann *stopped* continuing her campaign after the Iowa results (implied by the context of the other candidates' actions).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gingrich** - The text says Gingrich praised Centorum and criticized Romney, implying he continued to be involved.
* **C: Perry** - Perry stated he would assess his path forward and then *did* decide to continue, fighting in the South Carolina primary.
* **D: Romney** - The text only mentions Gingrich criticizing Romney, not Romney stopping his campaign.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney kaakas ka natijah aane key baad eek deegar ummidwar key bary mein ziyadah baat ki thee?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Natijay aaney key baad gunrich nay centorum kee tareef kee, lekin romani keliye gunrich key khelaaf lava mein manfi ishtehaar keliye tanqeed kee.""  This translates to: ""After the results came in, Gingrich praised Centorum, but criticized Romney for negative advertising against Gingrich.""

This clearly indicates that Gingrich spoke *about another candidate* (Romney) after the results were announced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bachmann:**  The text states Bachmann *ended* her campaign, she didn't comment on others.
* **C: Romney:** Romney is the target of Gingrich's criticism, not the one doing the talking.
* **D: Perry:** Perry spoke about his future plans, but didn't focus on criticizing other candidates immediately after the results.



"
Konsi wo tanha jagah hay jahaan 2015 sey pahley show ko dikhaya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Apnay awail dinon mein yeah show sirf der tak chalnay waali internet radio site **TogiNet Radio** parr dikhaya gayaa..."" (In its early days, the show was only shown on the long-running internet radio site **TogiNet Radio**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: East Texas:** East Texas is where the voice actors are *from*, not where the show was broadcast.
*   **C: AstroNet Radio:** AstroNet Radio was established in late 2015, *after* the show's initial run.
*   **D: Maqami radio station:** The passage only says TogiNet Radio was ""marked"" on tock radio, meaning it was listed there, not that it broadcast *on* a local radio station.



"
Station show ki iss tor parr wazahat karta hay ke usmein kis qism ka ghumao hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Shauqiyah (Amateur/Hobbyist)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*yeah show mein asl mein shoqia aawaz key adakaar pesh keeye gaye*..."" which directly translates to ""...the show actually features **amateur/hobbyist voice actors**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Awaami (Public/Popular):** While the website *describes* it as ""awami"" (public/popular), the question asks about the *kind of actors* featured.
*   **C: Puraani (Old/Vintage):** The show is described as ""qadeem school radio theater"" (old school radio theater), but that refers to the *style* of the show, not the actors.
*   **D: Maqami (Local):**  The actors *are* local (from East Texas), but the question asks about the *kind* of actors - are they professional, amateur, etc.



"
David Headley ney kiya ekattha kiya thaa ke usse bilaakhir jangju jamaat key hamlah mein moawanat hui thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Malumat (Information)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dude Headley kee scouting aur **malumati ijtema** nay pakistani askariyat pasand group lashkar taibah key 10 bandooq bardaron ko operation chalanay mein madad farahim kee.""  This translates to ""David Headley's scouting and **information gathering** helped the Pakistani military-aligned group Lashkar-e-Taiba's 10 gunmen launch the operation.""

The question asks what David Headley gathered that aided the attack. The text specifically mentions he gathered *information*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Grenades** - While grenades were *used* in the attack, Headley didn't gather them.
*   **C: Bandooq bardar (Gunmen)** - Headley didn't gather the gunmen; he helped facilitate their operation.
*   **D: Automatic Aslahe (Automatic Weapons)** - Similar to grenades, he didn't gather the weapons themselves."
konsa amado raft ka zariyah jnagju jmaat ne Mumbai pahunchne mein istemaal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kashti** (Ship).

The passage explicitly states: ""Mumbai parr hamlah karnay waale eek **kashti** say 26 nomber 2008 ko aayey they."" (Those who attacked Mumbai came by **ship** on November 26, 2008.)"
Konsa bayaniyah durrust tor parr ebarat mein mazkoor naadal aur Raonic ke brusbin opne match key natijah ki akkasi karta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic ney Nadaal ko haraa diya** (Raonic defeated Nadal).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hall hee mein woh rawank key khelaaf brusbin open mein haar gayaa."" (He lost to Raonic in the Brusbin Open in the hall). This clearly indicates Raonic won the match against Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic ko net 88% points miley** (Raonic scored 88% net points) - The passage says Nadal scored 88% net points, not Raonic.
* **C: Nadaal ney Raonic ko haraa diya** (Nadal defeated Raonic) - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: Raonic ney 76 points score kiye** (Raonic scored 76 points) - The passage states Nadal won a match with 76 points, not Raonic. It doesn't mention Raonic's score in *that specific match*.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab se, nadaal aur raonic ki pahle serve key baad kia position thee?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic ko net 88% points miley** (Raonic scored 88% net points).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Peheli baari mein 76 points say jeetnay waale match mein nadaal nay %88 net points haasil kiye."" (In the first match won by 76 points, Nadal obtained 88% net points).  This means *Raonic* scored 88% of the net points (because it's describing the match where Nadal won).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nadaal ney 76 points haasil kiye** (Nadal scored 76 points) -  The text says Nadal *won* by 76 points, not that he *scored* 76 points total.
* **C: Score 7-2 thaa** (The score was 7-2) - This refers to Nadal's overall record *against* Canada, not the specific match being discussed.
* **D: Raonic ney Nadaal ko haraa diya** (Raonic defeated Nadal) - The text states Nadal won, and also mentions he lost to Rawank (likely a typo for Raonic) in the Brusbin Open – but this doesn't mean Raonic won *this* match.



"
Naked News ki teen nayi nashriyaat mein konsi zubaan ka programme shaamil nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Japani**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News *already* reports in English and Japanese. It's *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean.  Therefore, Japanese is not one of the *new* publications.

*   **Atalwai** (Italian) - is mentioned as a new language.
*   **Koreayi** (Korean) - is mentioned as a new language.
*   **Hispanawi** (Spanish) - is mentioned as a new language.
*   **Japani** (Japanese) - is an existing language for Naked News.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, naked news ki nayi nashriyaat kahan dastiyaab nahi hongee?","The correct answer is **C: Theaters**.

Here's why:

The passage states the new publications will be available on:

*   Television
*   Web (Internet)
*   Mobile devices (which includes cellphones)

It *doesn't* mention theaters as a platform for Naked News's new publications. Therefore, the new publications will not be available in theaters.



"
Kitney Moqabilaa karney walon ney jaaint salalom ko mokammal nahein kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jaaint salalom mein majmuyi 117 mein say 45 scares uss muqabilah mean koyee bhee darjah haasil karnay say qaasir rahay.""  This translates to ""In the giant slalom, out of 117 competitors, 45 were unable to achieve any rank in the competition.""  This means 45 competitors did not complete the giant slalom successfully.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 36** - This refers to the number of competitors with an ""incomplete race"" in the first slalom, not the giant slalom.
*   **B: 117** - This is the *total* number of competitors in the giant slalom, not the number who didn't finish.
*   **C: 4** - This refers to the number of women who failed to complete their range, which is a different detail from the question.



"
Konsey darjah zail bayaniye durust tor parr championship mein daud key natayej ki akkasi kartey hein?,"The correct answer is **B: 45 scares ney jaaint salalom mein apni daudein mokammal nahein ki thee.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""jaaint salalom mein majmuyi 117 mein say 45 scares uss muqabilah mean koyee bhee darjah haasil karnay say qaasir rahay"" - meaning 45 competitors failed to finish the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doosri daud mein, carpenado ney Hungry ki taraf sey eek scare sey pahle mokammal kiya thaa.** The passage states Carpenado was *slower* than the Hungarian competitor (Giongi Deny) by 1:09.02 minutes, not faster.
* **C: Salalom key moqabile mein ziyadah scares ney jaaint salalo mokammal kiya thaa.** The passage doesn't compare the number of finishers between the two events, only that 45 didn't finish the Giant Slalom.
* **D: Carpenado ney salalom mein daswan mokammal kar liyaa.**  While true, this refers to the *Giant Slalom* (jaaint salalom) not the initial Salalom where she had an ""incomplete race.""



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsa NBA ney moattal karney ka faisla kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Budh ko united states national basket ball issosiission (NBA) nay COVID-19 key hawalay say tafakkuraat kee benaa parr apna peshah waranah season muattal kardiya."" This translates to: ""On Wednesday, the United States National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its professional season due to concerns about COVID-19.""

The question asks *what* the NBA suspended. The passage clearly states it was the *basketball season*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Utah Jazz ka eek kheladi (A Utah Jazz player)** - While a Jazz player *tested positive*, the NBA didn't suspend *the player* – they suspended the season.
*   **C: COVID-19 ki jaanch mein musbat paaya gaya koyi khelaadi (A player who tested positive for COVID-19)** - Again, the positive test was the *reason* for the suspension, not what was suspended.
*   **D: Utah Jazz ki basketball team (The Utah Jazz basketball team)** - The team wasn't suspended; the league suspended the season.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, virus key baare mein NBA ki tashwishaat kaa baes kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Utah Jazz khel mein motaddid kheladi jaanch mein musbat paye gaye they** (Multiple players on the Utah Jazz team tested positive).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nba key iss faislay key baad yutah key jaaz kheladi kee covid-19 wires jaanch musbat payee gayee hay."" This translates to ""After the NBA's decision, a COVID-19 test of a Utah Jazz player came back positive.""  While it starts with *a* player, the implication is that it led to further testing revealing *multiple* positive cases, triggering the suspension.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: NBA key araakin ki jaanch musbat aayi thee** (NBA members tested positive) - This is too general. The passage specifically mentions the Utah Jazz.
* **C: Utah Jazz key eek kheladi ney jaanch mein musbat honay key baad kam karkardagi ki thee** (A Utah Jazz player performed poorly after testing positive) - The passage doesn't mention performance.
* **D: Utah Jazz key eek kheladi ki jaanch musbat aayi thee** (A Utah Jazz player tested positive) - While true, it doesn't fully capture the *reason* for the NBA's concern – it was the positive tests of *multiple* players that led to the suspension.



"
Khel mein Atlanta Thrashers key khilaaf Washington Capitals key liye khel ki jeet kaa goal kisney score kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raat mein uss kaa doosra goal, season kaa uss kaa 60van goal thaa..."" (His second goal of the night was his 60th goal of the season...).  It also clarifies that Ovechkin was the one who reached 60 goals, a feat not accomplished since Jagr and Lemieux in 1995-96.  The passage implies Ovechkin scored the winning goal as it highlights his performance in the 5-3 victory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nicklas Backstrom:** The passage mentions Backstrom *assisted* on Ovechkin's first goal, but didn't score the winning goal.
* **B: Jaromir Jagr:** The passage mentions Jagr as a point of comparison (the last to reach 60 goals *before* Ovechkin), not as the scorer of the winning goal in this game.
* **C: Mario Lemieux:** Similar to Jagr, Lemieux is mentioned for historical context, not for scoring the winning goal in this game.



"
Capitals bamoqabilah Thrashers game key dauraan season ka apna 60vaan goal kiss ney score kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Raat mein uss kaa doosra goal, season kaa uss kaa 60van goal thaa, jis say woh pehla kheladi bann gayaa jis nay 1995-96 say eek season mean 60 yaa zayed goal kiye...""  This clearly refers to Ovechkin scoring his 60th goal of the season during that game.

The text *also* mentions that Jagr and Lemieux reached that milestone in the 1995-96 season, but Ovechkin was the one who achieved it *in this game*.



"
Northern Rock bank ko kabb hukumat sey himaayat drkaar thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Rahan key bohraan key dauraan** (During the housing crisis).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: *""2007 key doraan sab prime qarzah jaati bohraan say saamna honey kee benaa parr northern rock ko himayat kee zaroorat thee.""*  This translates to: ""During 2007, due to the subprime mortgage crisis, Northern Rock needed support.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bank key qomi hojaaney key baad** (After the bank became nationalized) - It *received* support *before* being nationalized.
* **B: jabb bank asset management company sey judaa ho gaya thaa** (When the bank separated from the asset management company) - This happened *after* the need for support.
* **C: Warjan group key bank ko kharidney key baad** (After the Warjan group bid to buy the bank) - This happened *after* the need for support.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsey darjah zail bayaniye durust tor parr Warjan group ki Northern Rock bank key saath saudah baziyon ki wazahat kartey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Warjan group ney bank ko rahan key bohraan key baad fauri himaayat ki peshkash ki thee.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Sir richard branson key warjan group nay bank ko qomi milkiyat qaraar deenay say qabal mustarid kardah bank keliye boli lagayi thee."" (Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group bid for the bank before it was nationalized.) This indicates they offered support *before* the government took ownership, during the prime mortgage crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Warjan group ney bhee Northern Rock ki asset management company kharidee thee:** The passage explicitly states they *did not* buy the asset management company: ""Warjeen nay sirf naadran rock key 'achhay bank' ko kharida hay, nah keh isset mangement company ko."" (Virgin only bought the 'good bank' of Northern Rock, not the asset management company.)
*   **B: Warjan group ney bank ko uskey qomi milkiyat mein aane key baad kharid liyaa thaa:** The passage states they bid *before* nationalization, not after.
*   **D: Warjan group ki bank key liye pahli boli bank key qomi milkiyat mein aaney key baad lagayi gayi thee:** Again, the passage clearly says they bid *before* the bank was nationalized.



"
"Jaisa kehh ebarat mein bayan kiya gaya hay, konsa mulk Kyoto key mahaul moahedah parr dastakhat karney sey motassir hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Australia**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Australia kee saabiq conservatives hukumat nay cuto misaq parr dastakhat karnay say inkaar kiya thaa..."" which translates to ""Australia's former conservative government refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol...""

Therefore, Australia is the country mentioned as being affected by not signing the Kyoto Protocol. While the text also mentions India and China, it states they aren't bound by gas emission targets, not that they were *affected* by the Protocol itself. The US is mentioned as being the only developed nation *not* ratifying it, but Australia's refusal is directly stated as a past event impacting *them*.



"
Australia ki sabiqah hukumat ka khiyaal tha kehh Kyoto ki tausique kiss cheez ko noqsaan pahunchaaney kaa sabab hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Mulk ki maeeshat** (The country's economy).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Australia kee saabiq conservatives hukumat nay cuto misaq parr dastakhat karnay say inkaar kiya thaa iss benaa parr kehh yeah uss key **iqtesad key liye muzir** hoga...""  This translates to ""Australia's former conservative government refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol because it would be **harmful to its economy**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amerika** - The passage mentions the US being the only developed nation not ratifying, but doesn't state Australia's concern *was* about America.
*   **C: koyley key mahreen** - While the text mentions coal exports, the primary reason given for refusing to sign was the overall economic impact, not just coal miners.
*   **D: Mulk key ikhraaj key ahdaaf** - The passage doesn't say Australia was worried about meeting emissions targets, but about the *economic cost* of trying to do so.



"
Konsa programme trial mein shooter thaa jiskey liye bharti ki gayie thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Hunting programme ka sporting shooters issosiission**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""NPWS aur sporting shooters issosiission of australia (NSW) ink kee shirakat mein ahal razakaron o sporting shooters issosiission key **hunting programme** key taht bharti kiya gayaa thaa."" (Volunteers and sporting shooters were recruited under the hunting program of the sporting shooters association in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW)).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Australia program kaa sporting shooters issosiission** - The text doesn't mention a specific ""Australia program"".
*   **B: Park ka tahaffuz aur Heritage program** - While mentioned in relation to a director's role (Mak Ow Flynn), this isn't the program the shooters were *recruited for*.
*   **C: NPWS program** -  NPWS is a partner *in* the program, but the program itself is the hunting program.



"
konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr keeday control trial ki akkasi karta hey?,"The correct answer is **B: Shooters ney tarbiyat ki hidayat wosul ki gayee thee** (Shooters received training instructions).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""pehlay nishanah baazi key liye muntakhab kardah chaar nishanay baazon nay jaamaa hifazati aur tarbiyati hidayaat wasool keen."" (The four shooters selected for initial shooting received safety and training instructions.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chunkehh yehh program ka pahlaa trial thaa, isliye iskee qadr paimayee nahein kee gayee thee** (Because this was the first trial of the program, it was not evaluated) - The passage mentions the trial *is* monitored and its effectiveness *is* assessed, contradicting this option.
* **C: Shooters rengeron sey hairaan they** (Shooters were surprised by the rangers) - The passage doesn't mention any surprise or reaction from the shooters towards the rangers. It states they are *monitored* by them.
* **D: Chaar shooters muntakhab nahein kiye gaye they** (Four shooters were not selected) - The passage directly states ""pehlay nishanah baazi key liye muntakhab kardah chaar nishanay baazon"" (four shooters were selected for initial shooting).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tafreeq kahan milli thee?","The correct answer is **A: Rift waadi mein (In the Rift Valley)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yeah Ethiopia mein rift veeli research service parr eek mohqqaq..."" which translates to ""...this researcher from the Rift Valley research service in Ethiopia..."".  The context is about findings *within* the Rift Valley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eek fossil parr (On a fossil):** While fossils are likely *found* in the Rift Valley, the passage doesn't say the difference/discovery was *on* a fossil itself.
* **C: Salmaati shahadat mein (In safety evidence):**  The passage mentions ""shagaaf salmati shahadat"" (amazing safety evidence) but doesn't state the difference was *in* the evidence itself. It says the finding predates the evidence's dating.
* **D: Ethiopia mein (In Ethiopia):**  While the research is *based* in Ethiopia, the specific location of the difference/discovery is within the Rift Valley *in* Ethiopia.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez tawaqqo sey pahley waqey hui thee?","The correct answer is **A: Fossil ki daryaft (Fossil discovery)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Iss rukaaz kee bunyaad parr iss kaa matlab yeah hay kehh yeah shagaaf salmati shahadat kee jaanib say qayaas kiye gaye waqat say **kahein pehle hay**."" This translates to ""Based on this record, it means this is *before* the time estimated by the staggering safety evidence.""  

Barheen Asfaa then explains this means ""everything has to be put back.""  The context implies ""everything"" refers to the timeline of events. Therefore, the fossil discovery (the record being referred to) is older than the estimations based on the safety evidence/dating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tafreeque (Separation/Breakup):** The passage doesn't directly say the breakup happened before the dating.
*   **C: Salmaati shahadat ka tajziyah (Safety evidence analysis):** The passage states the record is *before* the time of this analysis.
*   **D: Rift waadi mein tahqique (Research in the Rift Valley):** The research is happening *now*, based on the existing record. It's not something that happened before the dating.



"
Video game key dauran eek kheladi ko harakaat key jod tod key liye kiss cheez ki darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Controller ko hwa mein hilayein**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Iss say game khelnay waale iss qaabil ho jayein gay kehh device ko hawa mein hilla karr video games key afaal wo harkat ko control karr sakein."" (This will enable players to control actions and movements in video games by waving the device in the air.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yaqinee banayein kehh controller key sensor ko console key qareeb position dee gayee hay:** While sensor positioning is *important* for the system to work, it's not the action the player needs to *do* to control the game.
* **B: Unki position ko tikoni banayein:** The passage doesn't mention anything about triangular positioning.
* **C: Unki television key qareeb sensor ko rakhein:**  This describes how the controller *works*, not what the player *does*.



"
Kisi television key remote key moshabah honay key liye kiss cheez ko design kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nintendo Revolution controller**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the controller ""is similar to a television remote"" and was designed *to be* like one. While the sensors (A) are *part* of how it achieves that similarity, the controller itself is the thing that was designed. Options C and D are related to the event, but not the design itself.
"
Xinhua khabar rasaan agency sey tazah tareen report mein kiya bayan nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Chiyarah Ürümqi mein lend kiya thaa** (The plane landed in Ürümqi).

Here's why:

The passage states the initial report said the plane was *not* allowed to land in Ürümqi and was turned back towards Afghanistan.  It doesn't say it *did* land there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chiyarah ko eek bomb ka kharah lahique hogya thaa** (The plane was found to have a bomb) - The passage mentions a bomb threat was made.
* **C: Chiyarah Afghanistan key liye mod diya gya thaa** (The plane was turned towards Afghanistan) - This is explicitly stated in the passage.
* **D: Chiyarah Kandahar mein lend kiya thaa** (The plane landed in Kandahar) - The passage states the plane landed in Kandahar.



"
Xinhua ki nayi agency ki sabsey pahli report mein kiya bayan nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Chiyarah ko fauri lend karney sey manaa karr diya gaya thaa** (The plane was denied immediate landing).

Here's why:

The passage states the *initial* report said the plane was turned back *after* being denied landing in Urumqi. It doesn't say the denial of landing was mentioned in the *first* report.  The first report simply stated the plane had been hijacked and then turned back towards Afghanistan. The reason for the turnback (denial of landing) came out *later* with more information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chiyarah hijack karr liya gaya thaa** - The passage clearly states the first report *did* mention the hijacking.
*   **C: Chiyarah ko wapas Afghanistan key liye mod diya gaya thaa** - The passage says the first report mentioned the plane being turned back to Afghanistan.
*   **D: Chiyarah ko eek bomb ka kharah lahique hogya thaa** - The passage states the bomb threat came *later* (""Baad mein...""), not in the initial report.



"
Radio program key dauraan Sara Danius ney kia elaan kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Committee Bob Dylan key saath rabetah karney key liye koshishein bnad kar dein gee** (Committee will stop trying to contact Bob Dylan).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sara Danius announced the committee had *given up* trying to reach Bob Dylan to deliver his Nobel Prize in Literature.  She said, ""filhaal ham kuchh nahein karr rahay"" (""currently we are doing nothing"") and described her attempts to contact him and receiving friendly responses, implying those attempts were now over.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Adab mein Nobel Prize jeentney walaa** (The winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature) - While the passage mentions the winner, the announcement *wasn't* about *who* won, but about the difficulty contacting the winner.
*   **B: Committee ko shareek kaaron sey koyi jawabaat mausul nahein hoyay they** (The committee received no responses from associates) - The passage states they *did* receive friendly responses.
*   **C: Adab mein Nobel Prize key liye 2016 key namzadgaan** (The nominees for the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2016) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Kiss tak pahuncha nahein jaa sakta?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Nobel committee has given up trying to reach **Bob Dylan** after being unable to make direct contact with him regarding his Nobel Prize in Literature. While they *have* contacted his closest associate (option A), the main issue is their inability to reach Dylan himself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bob Dylan key qareebi shreek kaar:** They *have* been contacted – the passage says the secretary called his closest associate.
*   **B: Sara Danius:** She is the one *making* the announcement, so she is clearly reachable.
*   **C: Swedish Academy:** The secretary is acting on behalf of the Swedish Academy, and they are aware of the situation.



"
kiss ney ahad parr “eek bada qadam” honey ka tabserah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bush key tarjuman **garden john daroye** nay shumali koriya key misaq kp """"koriyayi jazirah mein qaabil tasdiq johri hathiyaron kee takhfif say mutalliq hadaf haasil karnay kee samat mein eek badaa qadm"""" qaraar diyaa hay.""  

This directly translates to: ""Bush's translator **Gordon Johndroe** called North Korea's pledge """"a big step towards achieving goals related to the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula.""""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who made the statement about it being ""a big step.""



"
Słania ney motaddid mamalik key liye kitni mahrein banayi thee?,"The correct answer is **B: 1000**.

The passage states: ""unhon nay sweaden aur deegar 28 mamalik keliye 1000 stamp tayyaar kiye."" (They created 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.)

Therefore, the answer is 1000. The other options are incorrect as they suggest a higher number than what is explicitly mentioned in the text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tanki key vents sey mumkinah tor mosalsal rasao ki wajah kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Thermal tausee**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tanki key vents say rasao jaari thaa aur ghaliban uss kaa sabab tanki mean bahut ziyadah bhaap kaa jamao thaa."" ( ""...leaks were being released from the tank's vents and were likely caused by an excessive buildup of vapor in the tank."")

This indicates that the leaks are due to pressure build-up from vapor *inside* the tank. This vapor buildup is likely caused by **thermal expansion** (heat causing the oil to expand and create more vapor).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sanavi bharayi kaa raqbah salahiyat tak bhara ja rahaa hay** (Secondary filling area is being filled to capacity) - While mentioned, this isn't directly linked to the *reason* for the leaks.
*   **B: Aag key Hukm key system ki eek mamool ki jaanch** (A routine check of the fire command system) - The passage doesn't mention any checks or fire command systems being related to the leaks.
*   **D: Fort Greely key eek pump station mein aag** (Fire at a pump station at Fort Greely) - The passage doesn't connect any fire at Fort Greely to the tank leaks.



"
Rahat darichey kiyon khul gaye they?,"The correct answer is **A: Tankiyon key andar thermal tausee hui thee** (Thermal expansion occurred inside the tanks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tanki key vents say rasao jaari thaa aur ghaliban uss kaa sabab tanki mean bahut ziyadah bhaap kaa jamao thaa."" This translates to ""...liquid was being released from the tank vents and it was likely due to a buildup of too much vapor inside the tank.""  

Vapor buildup is a direct result of thermal expansion – the crude oil inside the tank heated up, causing it to expand and create more vapor pressure, which then vented out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: System ki jaanch key baad power ki nakaami hui thee** (Power failure occurred after the system check) - The passage doesn't mention a power failure.
* **C: Tankiyaan mokammal salahiyat mein theen** (The tanks were at full capacity) - The passage indicates the tanks *weren't* at full capacity, specifically mentioning the secondary containment area wasn’t filled.
* **D: Sananvi bharao ka raqbah kaafi barrel ka haamil nahein ho saka** (The secondary containment area could not hold enough barrels) - While the secondary containment wasn’t full, this doesn’t explain *why* liquid was venting from the tanks.

Filhaal nawwein ward mein paani kitna ooncha hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kamar ki oonchayi** (Waist-high).

The text states: ""Naeinth ward, jis nay qatrinah key toofan key doraan 20 fit oonche sailaab kaa saamna kiya, uss waqat kamar tak oonche paani mean hay keunkeh nazdiki band satah say buland thaa.""  This directly translates to: ""The Ninth Ward, which faced a 20-foot flood during Katrina, is currently waist-high in water because it's higher than the nearby closed surface.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 20 fit** - This was the height of the flood during Katrina, not the *current* water level.
*   **B: 6 inchein** - This is the amount of rainfall that could cause problems, not the current water level.
*   **D: 100 fit** - This refers to the width of the levee the water is spreading over, not the water level.



"
"Katrina toofan key doraan, nawein ward mein kiya hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Sailaab ka paani 20 fit ooncha thaa**.

The text specifically states: ""Naeinth ward, jis nay qatrinah key toofan key doraan 20 fit oonche sailaab kaa saamna kiya..."" (The Ninth Ward, which faced a 20-foot high flood during Katrina...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sailaab ka paani 100 fit choudaa tha** - The text says the water *spread* over 100 feet of levee, not that the water was 100 feet deep.
*   **B: Kamar tak ooncha paani satah sey ooper hogaya thaa** - This is true *at the time of the report* due to the current situation, but it doesn't describe what happened *during Katrina*.
*   **D: 6 inch baarish sey kharaab satah ki khilaaf warzi hui thee** - This refers to a potential future problem, not what happened during Katrina.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiskee Hammelton nay tasdiq nahein ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Jahaan mareez ney safar kiya thaa (Where the patient travelled)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hamilton confirmed the hospital admitted the patient in *stable condition* and followed *protocol to control infection*. It also mentions the patient *had been in Nigeria where some Ebola cases had emerged*.

However, Hamilton did **not** confirm *where* the patient had travelled, only *that* they had travelled to a region with Ebola cases. The focus of his confirmation was on the hospital's response, not the patient's travel history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Deegar mareez key virus sey moahidaah kaa imkaan (Possibility of infection from other patients):** The hospital's isolation protocol was implemented *to prevent* infection from other patients. Hamilton confirmed the protocol was followed, implicitly addressing this risk.
*   **C: Aaya Sahee protocol ki pairawee ki gayi thee (Correct protocol was followed):** Hamilton directly confirmed this.
*   **D: Mareez ki mojudah soorate haal (Patient's current condition):** Hamilton confirmed the patient was admitted in stable condition.



"
Kuchh aisee cheez kiya hay saiencedaan jiskee khakah bnana chahtey hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Protein kee tashkeel kaisey hoti hay (How proteins are formed)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions the possibility of ""damdaar setaray"" (massive stars) delivering materials to Earth, including ""namiyati maadday"" (complex matter) *that can build proteins and support life*.  The whole premise revolves around understanding how life's building blocks – proteins – could have originated.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Jabb damdaar Sitaraah Zameen key saath takraya thaa (When massive stars collided with Earth):** The passage discusses delivery *of* materials, not the collisions themselves. The focus isn't *when* it happened but *what* was delivered.
* **C: Jo namiyaati masalah hay (The complex matter problem):** While complex matter is mentioned, the passage isn't focused on *defining* the problem of complex matter, but rather its potential role in creating life.
* **D: Zameen ki tashkeel kaisey hui hay (How Earth was formed):** Earth's formation is a background context, but the core idea is about the origin of the *ingredients* for life, not the planet itself.

The passage is clearly interested in how the materials brought by these stars could have led to the formation of proteins – the fundamental component of life. Therefore, option B is the most direct answer to the question ""Kuchh aisee cheez kiya hay saiencedaan jiskee khakah bnana chahtey hein?"" (What is something scientists want to figure out?).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bandish mein maqami police ney kiya kirdaar anjaam diyaa thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Unhon ney deegar raston ki taraf rahnumayi ki thee** (They guided traffic towards other routes).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""aur motor sawaron ko lamba rasta ikhtiyar kartay hoay jaaney kee hidayat denay keliye 80 police ahalkaron kee madad lie gayee thee.""  This directly translates to ""and 80 police officers were used to guide motorists to take a longer route.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhon ney FBI parr bandish key liye dabao banaya thaa** (They put pressure on the FBI for the restriction) - The passage states the *land transportation authority* acted under FBI pressure, not the police putting pressure *on* the FBI.
* **B: Unhon ney bandish karney key faisalah kiya thaa** (They made the decision to impose the restriction) - The land transportation authority made the decision, again under FBI pressure.
* **D: Unhon ney motabadil rastah mein traffic takhiraat ki report ki thee** (They reported traffic delays on alternative routes) - The passage states there were *no reported* delays on the alternative routes.



"
Bandish key doraan tube key daakhli raaston key saath kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Unhein block kar diya gaya thaa** (They were blocked).

The passage explicitly states: ""Tube key daakhli raaston ko block karnay keliye bharay hoay turkon kaa istemaal kiya gayaa thaa..."" which translates to ""Filled trucks were used to block the inner routes of the tube..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unhein bator eek raastah istemaal kiya gaya thaa** (They were used as a route) - The passage says they were *blocked*, not used.
* **C: Unhein motor sawaron key liye khol diya gaya thaa** (They were opened for motorcyclists) - The passage states motorcyclists were *directed to take a longer route*, implying the tube routes were *not* open.
* **D: Bhaari traffic aagey barh rahi thee** (Heavy traffic was moving forward) - The passage mentions heavy traffic on alternate routes, but not within the tube routes themselves.  The tube routes were blocked.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, photographer key gaadi sey takraaney sey pahley kia nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Photographer ko Highway Patrol ki jaanib sey sadak parr waapass jaaney kaa hukum diya gaya thaa.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""…*uss say california high way patrol police key afsar nay jo trophic stop parr mamur thaa, uss ko hukam diyaa kehh woh do baar sadak paar karkay wapas aayey.*"" (…the California Highway Patrol officer stationed at the traffic stop ordered him to cross the road twice and come back). This clearly happened *before* the collision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Photographer ney apni gaadi photographer parr park ki thee** - The text says the photographer parked on the *opposite* side of Bieber’s vehicle.
*   **C: Photographer ney eek police stop ki tasaaveer lee thee** - The text says he *tried* to take pictures, but this was *before* he was ordered to cross the street.
*   **D: Potographer Bieber ki tasweer leney kaa ahal thaa** - While implied, the text doesn't directly state he was *intending* to photograph Bieber, just that he was near Bieber's vehicle.



"
Photographer gaadi sey takkar khaaney sey pahley kiya karney ki koshish karr rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek police stop ki tasaweer lenaa** (Taking pictures of a police stop).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tarfihi news site TMZ kaa manna hay kehh photo grapher nay supploveda balwaar kee doosri jaanib apni gaadi ko khadaa kiya aur sadak paar karnay aur aagay badhnay say pehle uss nay police stop kee picture lenay kee koshish kee.""  This translates to: ""Entertainment news site TMZ believes the photographer parked his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and before crossing the road and moving forward, he tried to take pictures of the police stop.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sepulveda Boulevard parr park karna** (Parking on Sepulveda Boulevard) - He *had* parked, but that wasn't what he was trying to *do* right before the accident.
* **C: Eek masroof highway ko paar karnaa** (Crossing a busy highway) - He was intending to cross, but the picture-taking happened *before* attempting to cross.
* **D: Eek police afsar ko manana kehh wohh usey shooting jaari rakhney ki ejaazat dey** (Convincing a police officer to let him continue shooting) - The text doesn’t mention anything about asking permission to continue shooting.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor par virus key liye jaanch mein musbat honey key baad ki sadar ki halat ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Unhein acchaa mahsoos nahein hota hay (They don't feel well)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the president felt *better* and expected to return to duties soon (""*main khud ko achhi aur behatar haalat mein mahsus karraha hon...peer key roz apni tamaam deutiyon parr wapas lotnay kee twaqqo karta hoon*""). This contradicts the statement that they didn't feel well.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Unhein galey ki sozish thee (They had a sore throat)** - The passage says ""*bukhaar aur kharab gulla honey*,"" which translates to fever and sore throat.
*   **C: Wo mustahkam halat mein they (They were in stable condition)** - The passage states ""*Sadar jamhuria kee haalat mustahkam hay*.""
*   **D: Unhein bukhaar thaa (They had a fever)** -  As mentioned above, the passage explicitly states ""*bukhaar...*"".

Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't align with the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sadar key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh itnaa accha hay kehh mowasilaati kaam kar sakta hay** (He is well enough to be able to do communication work).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bukhaar aur kharab gulla honey key elawah, main khud ko achhi aur behatar haalat mein mahsus karraha hon kehh telly commuting key zariye apna kam jaari rakh sakoon."" (Besides fever and a sore throat, I feel good and better enough to continue my work through telecommuting.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhein bukhaar nahein hay** (He doesn't have a fever) - The passage specifically mentions he *does* have a fever.
* **B: Kayi hafton tak wohh ghar parr hi rahein gay** (He will stay at home for many weeks) - The passage states he will be isolating for *a few days* (""kayee dinon tak"").
* **D: Usko sakht darjah ka virus hay** (He has a severe form of the virus) - The passage doesn't mention the severity of the virus, only symptoms like fever and sore throat.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Surtaani tofaan gona key kamzor hotey rahney ki tawaqqo kabb thee?","The correct answer is **B: Jabb hawayein taqriban 83 kelometer fee ghantah parr kam hojaye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aaj saweray hawaon kee raftaar taqriban 83 kelometer fee ghantah thee **aur ummid thee kehh kam ho jaye gee**.""  (This morning the wind speed was approximately 83 kilometers per hour **and there was hope that it would decrease**.)

This directly indicates the expectation of weakening *when* the winds were at 83 kilometers per hour. The passage doesn't mention expectations related to the other options (Maldives, reaching its peak, or 149 mph winds).



"
Surtaani tofaan gona ki chotti parr hawayein kitni tez theen?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilometer fee ghanta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""jisay maldeep kee zubaan mein khajoor key patton key thailay kaa naam diyaa gayaa hay, hawayein 240 kelometer fee ghantah (149 meal fee ghantah) kee raftaar say pahunch gayein.""  This translates to ""which in Maldivian is called the palm-leaf bag, winds reached speeds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).""

The question asks for the speed of the winds at its *smallest* intensity (chotti parr). The text gives 149 miles per hour as the equivalent speed when 240 kilometers per hour is reached. Therefore, 149 kilometer fee ghanta is the correct answer, as it is the lower speed mentioned.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko carinia brewees ka rawayya nahein samjha jata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Iska kaseer naam hay (It has a lot of names)**.

Here's why:

The passage states *Surkh jawaar bhaata, qudrati tor parr waaqea honey waale carinia brewees key waahid hayatiyati zindah wajood kee mamool say ziyadah ertekaz kee wajah say aata hay.*  This translates to: ""Red tide is caused by the excessive concentration of a single living organism, *Carenia brevis*, which occurs naturally."" 

The passage focuses on *Carenia brevis* as a **single** organism responsible for red tide.  Having ""a lot of names"" would contradict this specific identification.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Yehh tahaalib ki eek qism hay (It is a type of algae)** -  The passage indirectly implies this by describing *Carenia brevis* as a living organism which is a type of algae.
* **B: Yehh insaaan key aasab ko na ahal kar sakta hay (It can damage human nerves)** -  The passage explicitly states that the neurotoxins produced by *Carenia brevis* can affect the nerves of both humans and fish.
* **D: Yehh fitri tor parr waqea hota hay (It occurs naturally)** -  The passage directly states that red tide occurs ""naturally.""



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko carinia brewees nahein kar sakta?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisi bhee surate haal mein tadaad mein tezi sey barhh janaa (Increasing rapidly in number under any circumstances)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *carinia brewees* thrives and increases in number due to specific natural conditions (like red tide). It *doesn't* increase rapidly in *all* circumstances.  The passage says favorable conditions *allow* them to increase, not that they always do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Machli key aasab ko na ahal karna (Incapacitating fish nerves):** The passage clearly states *carinia brewees* produce neurotoxins that affect the nerves of fish.
*   **C: Paani ko motassir karna (Affecting water):** The passage discusses how these algae concentrate in water, and the resulting toxins affect the water quality.
*   **D: Neurotoxin paidaa karnaa (Producing neurotoxins):** The passage directly states that *carinia brewees* produce neurotoxins.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Fleshiya toofan key natijah key tor parr waqea nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Sadkon kaa sailaab (Flooding of roads)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""halankeh abhi tak, uss say kisee qism key noqsan yaa sailaab kee ittelaa nahein hay"" which translates to ""although so far, there is no report of any damage or flooding"".

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Fayeda mand barish (Beneficial rain):** The passage states 6.34 inches of rain was considered ""fayedah mand"" in Awaho.
*   **B: Garaj key saath barish (Rain with thunder):** The passage mentions ""Kuchh baarish key saath garaj aur bijli kee kadak bhee thee"" (There was also thunder and lightning with some rain).
*   **C: Mokarrar bijlee ki chamak (Frequent lightning):** This is part of the ""garaj aur bijli kee kadak"" mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, road flooding is the only event that the passage explicitly states *did not* occur as a result of the Fleshiya storm.



"
Fleshiya toofan key barey mein konsaa bayaniyah galat hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Categri 4 key toofan mein tabdeel honay sey pahley tropical depression key tor parr yehh pahli categri kardah hay.**

Here's why:

The passage states Fleshiya *was* a Category 4 hurricane but *weakened* to a tropical depression *before* making landfall. It doesn't say it *started* as a tropical depression and then became a Category 4. It went the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Natijah khez barish sey Oahu ko fayedah hua thaa:** The passage explicitly states the rain in Oahu was considered ""beneficial"" (6.34 inches).
*   **C: Ziyadah tarr jazeeron mein barish dekhi gayi:**  The passage states ""most islands experienced rain"" from the remnants of the storm.
*   **D: Kuchh barishein bijlee ki chamak key saath thee:** The passage mentions ""some rain was accompanied by thunder and lightning"".



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr 2009 key Grand Prix toofan key natijah ki akkasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Fernando Alonso ko waqea mein shaamil kar diya gaya thaa** (Fernando Alonso was involved in the incident).

Here's why:

The passage states that Piquet Jr. crashed *after* the safety car period and *while* Alonso was benefiting from it (getting ahead of other cars). This ultimately led to an investigation and Piquet Jr. being dismissed in 2009.  The implication is Alonso benefited from a deliberately caused incident, making him involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Piquet Jr. ney jeet liyaa thaa** (Piquet Jr. won) - The passage doesn't say Piquet Jr. won any race.
*   **C: Piquet Jr. ko uskey baad goli maar dee gayi thee** (Piquet Jr. was shot afterwards) - The passage contains no such information.
*   **D: Safety car ko eek waqea mein shaamil kar diya gaya thaa** (The safety car was involved in the incident) - The safety car was *present* during the incident but wasn't directly involved in *causing* it.  It was Piquet Jr.'s crash that was the incident.



"
Takkar kabb waqea hua?,"The correct answer is **A: Alonso key garhaa stop key fauran baad** (Immediately after Alonso's pit stop).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the collision happened ""fernando alwanso keliye eek ibtedayi put stop key foran baad"" (immediately after Alonso's initial pit stop).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jabb deegar caron mein tel bharaa ja rahaa thaa** (When other cars were refueling) - While refueling happened *after* the crash, it wasn't *when* it happened. The passage says Piquet moved ahead *as* other cars went to refuel.
*   **C: Safety car key aaney sey pahley** (Before the safety car came) - The safety car was already out when the incident happened.
*   **D: Piquet key tel key liye andar jaaney key baad** (After Piquet went in for fuel) - This is the opposite of what happened. Piquet crashed *before* going in for fuel.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zial mein sey kisko aslan tahqeeq kaaron yaqeen karney key moqabiley kam waqt lagaa thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Parjatiyon kaa irteqaa (Species evolution)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*fakat do naslon mein nayi anwaa kaa irteqaa huwa, go kehh khayal iss amal nay iss say ziyadah waqat lia*...""  This translates to ""...a new species evolved in just two generations, though it was thought this process would take much longer.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Parjatiyon ki tashkeel (Species formation)** - While related to evolution, the passage focuses on the *speed* of the evolutionary process, not simply the formation of a new species.
*   **B: Parjatiyon key barey mein report karna (Reporting about species)** - This is about the researchers *reporting* findings, not the time it took for the actual evolutionary change.
*   **C: Mukhtalif parjatiyon key darmiyaan afzaesh (Breeding between different species)** - The passage mentions breeding (of finches), but the key point is how *quickly* evolution occurred *after* that breeding, not the breeding itself.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiski tahqeeq kaaron ney report nahein ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Nayi parjatiyon ki kahaan tashkeel hui thee** (Where the new species were formed).

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states:

* **B: Irteqaa key amal ki lambayi** (Length of the evolutionary process) - it mentions it took only two generations.
* **C: Nayi parjatiyon ka naam** (Name of the new species) - it identifies them as a new type of finch, specifically *Geospiza fortis* and *Geospiza conerasters*.
* **D: Afzaesh mein shaamil parindey** (Birds involved in breeding) - it states the new species arose from breeding between local Darwin's finches and cactus finches.

However, the passage doesn't ask or answer *where* the new species were formed, only *that* they were formed on the Galapagos Islands. The question asks what wasn't reported by the researchers, so A is the correct answer.



"
Gayon ki parade kahaan hogi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest shahar mein** (Bucharest city).

The passage states: ""Yeah fankarana taqrib bhee bakharist city haal kee eek muhim kaa hissah hay..."" which translates to ""This artistic event is also part of a campaign of the Bucharest city..."". It also explicitly says Bucharest will host CowParade, the world's largest public art event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Motaddid roomaniyayee shahron mein** (In various Romanian cities) - The passage focuses specifically on Bucharest.
*   **C: Puraa jonub mashriqi europe** (All of Southeastern Europe) - While Bucharest is *in* Southeastern Europe, the parade isn't happening across the entire region.
*   **D: Europe key motaddid darul hokumati shahron mein** (In various capital cities of Europe) - The passage specifically mentions Bucharest as the host.



"
Konsa dajah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr gaye parade ki wazahat krata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Yehh duniya mein bahut badee awaami fan ki mahfil hay** (It is a very large public art festival in the world).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...jo kehh duniya kaa sab say badaa awami fankarana event hay"" (which is the world's largest public art event).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yehh sirf “takhliqi” samjhey jaaney waley shahron mein waqea hota hay** (It only happens in cities considered ""creative"") - The passage doesn't say it *only* happens in creative cities, just that Bucharest is *trying* to portray itself as one.
* **B: isey Bucharest shahar key hall kee jaanib sey banaya gaya thaa** (It was created by the Bucharest city hall) - The passage says the city hall is *using* it as part of a campaign, not that they *created* the CowParade.
* **C: Yehh eek fan ki mahfil thee jo garmi key mausam mein purey jonub mashriqi europe mein munaqid ki jaati hay** (It's an art festival that is circulated throughout Southeastern Europe in the summer) - The passage states Bucharest is the *first* city in Southeastern Europe to host it. It isn't circulated.



"
Kiss wajah sey roos ney II-76 key istemaal ko moattal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: koyi waqea (an incident)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""uss haadsah key baad roose nay aayi ail-76 tayyaron ko khidmat say bartarf kardiya"" - meaning ""after the accident, Russia removed the IL-76 aircraft from service."" 

The incident (haadsah) of the engine separating during takeoff on October 7th directly led to the grounding of the IL-76 fleet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Androoni faujein (Internal forces):** The text mentions the IL-76 being used *by* internal forces, but doesn't say they caused the grounding.
*   **C: Soviet fauj (Soviet army):**  While the IL-76 has a history with the Soviet army, the grounding happened *after* the event described, and is a direct response to *that* event, not a general issue with the Soviet army.
*   **D: Eek zer iltewa tafteesh (An ongoing investigation):** The investigation was *started* after the incident, it wasn’t the *reason* for the grounding. The grounding happened *because* of the incident, and the investigation is to determine what happened.



"
II-76 kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek hawayi jahaaz** (An airplane).

The text explicitly states ""Aayi ail-76 1970 kee dahayi say rusee aur soviet afwaj kaa eek badaa mukawwin rahaa hay..."" (IL-76 has been a major component of Russian and Soviet forces since the 1970s...) and describes it experiencing an incident while ""udaan bhartay hee"" (taking off). This clearly indicates it's a type of aircraft.



"
Simpsons key liye kisney tahreeri team ko kiraye parr liyaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Brooks**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1989 mein uss nay di sampsins wadh brooks and govening kee tashkil mein madad di aur iss show key liye likhnay waalon kee awwaleen team ko bharti karnay key liye zimmah daar thaa.""  This translates to: ""In 1989, he helped form The Simpsons with Brooks and Goveing and was responsible for hiring the first team of writers for this show.""

Therefore, Brooks was the one who hired the writing team for The Simpsons.



"
"Fluke key hisaab sey, kisney uskey musbat tabsarey aur masrufiyat ko bhej rahaa thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Mard w aurat dono afraad (Both men and women)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the positive messages and encouragement came *after* a large number of men and women accepted medical necessity for abortions. This indicates that both groups were sending these supportive messages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doctor (Doctor):** While doctors are involved in medical decisions, the passage focuses on the messages *received* after the acceptance of abortion as a medical need by a wider population, not just from doctors.
*   **B: Khawateen ki sehat ki sargarmi (Women's health activism):**  While this group likely played a role, the passage specifically mentions both men and women.
*   **C: Mard hazraat (Men):** The passage states *both* men and women, so this is incomplete.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab, kiss cheez key baarey mein kuchh log nahein chahtey they kehh khawateen baat karein?","The correct answer is **C: Khawateen ki sehat (Women's health)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some people tried to *prevent women from talking about women's health* (khwateen ko khwateen kee sehat key mutalliq bolnay say jabraan roknay key liye).  The whole point of the passage revolves around this topic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mard aftaad (Male fall)** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Tibbi qimatein (Medical values)** - While medical needs are mentioned later, the initial attempt to silence was *about the topic itself*, not the valuation of it.
*   **D: Fluke** - ""Fluke"" appears in the beginning of the passage, but it's part of a phrase (""Flock (fluke) likhta hay"") and isn't the subject being suppressed.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa sayyarawi jism sabsey ziyadah motaharrik hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Zameen (Earth)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""जहां तक हमें मालूम है टाइटन की सेवा सिर्फ एक ही कोकाब है जो हरकियत का इज़हार करता है और उस का नाम है ज़मीन।""  (Where as far as we know, Titan only serves one planet that exhibits activity, and that is Earth.)

This directly indicates that Earth is the most active celestial body mentioned in the passage.  Titan is presented *as serving Earth* because Earth is the one demonstrating activity.
"
Eek saaf shaffaaf sayyaal parr mushtamil nadiyon aur jheelon ki kiss sayyarawi jism parr shanakht ki gayi hay?,"The passage states: ""yeah paani kee tarah bartao karnay jaarha hay. yeah paani kee tarah shaffaf hay..."" (it is going to behave like water. it is like water, transparent...). It also mentions that Titan is the only other celestial body besides Earth known to exhibit liquids on its surface.

The question asks which celestial body is identified as having rivers and lakes of a clear, transparent liquid.  Since the passage links this description to Titan, the answer is **B: Titan**.
"
Inn mein sey konsi tahqiqi pankh daryaft kaa natijah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaanwar key aaraishee pankh ka rang** (The color of the animal's ornamental feathers).

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* state the researchers determined the feather color:** ""Science daanon kaa kehna hay kehh uss janwar kaa palmaj (purr) oper peelay pann key saath shahiblot bhura thaa yaa neechey crotinoid rang kaa thaa."" (Scientists say the animal's plumage was grayish-brown with yellow patches on top or crotinoid colored underneath). This *is* a result of the feather discovery.

Let's look at why the other options *are* results of the research:

* **B: Yehh samajh kehh Udaan mein pankhon ka istemaal nahein hua thaa** (Understanding that the feathers were not used for flight):  The passage explicitly states: ""Paron kee saakht say lagtaa hay kehh woh parwaz key liye istemaal nahein huway balkeh darjae hararat kee gardish yaa izhaar key liye istemaal huway hain."" (The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but for thermoregulation or display.)
* **C: Pankh key irteqaa mein baseerat** (Insight into feather evolution): The passage says: ""Yeah tehqeeq parindon mein paron key irteqaa kaa idraak bhee farahim karti hay."" (This research also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.)
* **D: Yehh tasdique kehh ziyadah tarr dinosaur key pankh they** (Confirmation that more dinosaurs had feathers): The passage begins by saying: ""Iss say nah sirf iss baat kee tasdiq hoti hay kehh kam az kam kuchh ddainasooron key pankh hotay thay, yeah nazariyah pehle hee say baday paimanay parr aam hay..."" (This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread...)



Therefore, the color of the feathers is *not* something the research revealed a *new* understanding of – it *was* something discovered and stated in the findings."
Dinosaur key pankhon mein kiya cheez nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek dandi** (A shaft).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Keunkeh ddaina soor kee pankh mein achhi tarah say tayaar shudah shaft nahein hota, jis ko dandi kahaa jaataa hay...""  (Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, which is called a dandi...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asselcha** - The text doesn't mention anything about ""Asselcha"".
*   **C: Baligh aareshi pankh** - The text states the sample *does* show mature feathers (""namunah baaligh parr dikhata hay"").
*   **D: Eek zard rang kaa zereen jaanib** - The text describes colors like ""peelay pann key saath shahiblot bhura"" and ""crotinoid rang kaa"", meaning yellow and brownish/reddish colors *were* present.



"
ZMapp key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yehh mojudah infection ka elaaj karney key qabil hay lekin maut sey bahcaney key qabil nahi hay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*abhi tak koyee bhee dawaa waazeh tor parr maujudah infection key elaaj keliye mozun nahein payee gayee hay*..."" (so far no medicine has been approved to treat the current infection).  It also says ZMapp *didn't* provide as much benefit in preventing death as hoped.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Yehh antibodies sey banaa hua hay** - The passage states ""Eek anti body koktel zemap..."" (An antibody cocktail, ZMapp...)
*   **C: Yehh PALM trial mein bator control khidmat anjaam deta thaa** - The passage explicitly states ""PALM trial mein zemap nay control kaa kam kiya..."" (In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control...)
*   **D: Tahqiqat sey zaahir hota hay kehh iskey fawayed shuru mein jo khiyaal zahir kiye gaye they ussey kam hein** -  ""...rasmi tehqeeq say patah challa kehh yeah itnaa fayedah mand nahein thaa jitna maut ko roknay keliye matlub thaa."" (official research showed it wasn't as beneficial as needed to prevent death).



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor par PALM trial ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek contrrol dawa ka mowaznah teen deegar elaajon sey hua tha, jinmein sey eek ZMapp thaa** (A control drug was compared with three other treatments, one of which was ZMapp).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""PALM trial mein zemap nay control kaa kam kiya, yaani science daanon nay iss kaa istemaal bees line key tor parr kiya, aur iss key deegar teen elaajon kaa mawaznah kiya."" (In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to three other treatments.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tahqiqaat sey zaahir hua kehh ismein sabeqah khiyaal sey ziyaadah fawayed ho saktey hein** (Research shows it may have more benefits than previously thought) - The passage says ZMapp *didn't* prove as beneficial as hoped.
* **C: ZMapp ka istemaal trial ki buniyaadi line key tor par hua thaa** (ZMapp was used as the basic line of the trial) - While used as a baseline (control), the passage states it was *compared to* other treatments, not the foundational element itself.
* **D: Mojudah surate haal ka elaaj karney mein Isey motassir dikhaya gaya thaa** (It was shown to be ineffective in treating the current condition) - The passage says it wasn't *as* effective as needed to prevent death, but doesn't state it was entirely ineffective.



"
Tahqiq kaaron key khiyaal mein nayi chip kahaan sabsey ziyaadah aham thee?,"The correct answer is **A: kam aamadni waley mamalik (low-income countries)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sarkardah mohaqqeen kehtay hain kehh iss say kam aamadni waale mamalik key mareezon mein cancer, tapp wo daq, HIV aur miliriya kaa jald patah chall sakta hay..."" (Leading researchers say this can help detect cancer, tuberculosis, HIV and malaria early in patients in low-income countries...).  

The passage highlights the potential impact on early detection in countries where access to healthcare and diagnostic tools is limited.



"
Tashkhisi tool ki tameer karney key liye konsa tariqah istemaal kiya jaye gaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Meyaari inkjet printer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yeah eek chhoti see printable chip hay jo ghaliban eek ameriki sent mein **meyari ink jait printers** kaa istemaal karr key tayyaar kee jaa sakti hay.""  ( ""...this is a small printable chip that can generally be made using standard inkjet printers in an American cent."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Har eek key liye eek amriki cent** - This refers to the cost aspect, not the *method* of construction.
*   **C: Print karney key qaabil chip** - This is *what* is being made, not *how* it's being made.
*   **D: Deegar tashkhissi tool** - This is too general and doesn't answer the specific question.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, goshah dar daagon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Unmein sey bahut sey chaand ki satah parr nahein miley they**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Chand kee satah parr jaa bajaa payee jaaney waali khayiyon say malum hota hay kehh woh kam mausam dedah hain."" (The canyons found on the moon's surface indicate they are sparsely distributed.) This means they *have* been found on the moon's surface, contradicting option D.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Unko bananey waley waqeaat mumkinah tor parr filhaal waqea hui thee.** (The events that formed them may have happened relatively recently.) - The passage states ""jinn geologic haadsaat say unn kee takhliq huyee woh bahut haaliyah zamana key hain."" (The geological events that created them are of relatively recent times.)
* **B: Unki mojudgi ka matlab hay kehh chaand mein arziyaati sargarmi ki kami nahein hay.** (Their existence means that the moon is not completely devoid of geological activity.) - The passage directly challenges the idea of complete geological inactivity: ""Yeah nazariyah iss daawa kee tardid karta hay kehh chand mokammal tor parr arziyati srgarmi say mahroom hay."" (This theory contradicts the claim that the moon is completely devoid of geological activity.)
* **C: Hosakta hay wohh chaand key sukadney ka natijah ban jaye.** (They may be a result of the moon shrinking.) - The passage identifies lobate scarps as formed ""chand key sukadnay kee wajah say"" (due to the shrinking of the moon).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zameeni shaklon key motallique konsa nazriyah iss baat ki nishaan dahi karta hay kehh chaand parr waqea honay wali arziyaati sargarmi mojud hay?","The correct answer is **D: Haal mein monasib tor parr zameen ki shaklein bani theen (Recently formed landforms)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the landforms (""lobet scarps"") appear to have formed *slowly* as the moon *cooled*. It also notes that the features indicate the *geologic events that created them are relatively recent*.  This directly supports the idea that there's been recent (geologically speaking) geological activity - thus, evidence of ongoing or recent internal activity on the moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chaand aahistah tor parr sukad raha hay (The moon is slowly cooling)** - While true according to the passage, this is *why* the formations exist, not the evidence of current activity.
*   **B: Zameen ki shaklein bahut pahley bani theen (The landforms were formed a long time ago)** - This contradicts the passage, which specifically states they are *relatively recent*.
*   **C: Chaand ki satah parr kam miqdaar ki zameeni shaklein hi mojud hein (There are only a few landforms on the moon's surface)** - The passage doesn't focus on the *quantity* of landforms, but their *age and origin*.



"
"Ebaarat key hissaab sey, kiya cheez farde jurm tak ki hadd sey ziyadah ki nahein hogi?","The correct answer is **B: Tasweer ki ishaatein (Sharing of images)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that courts in Scotland generally discourage the publication of images, and the Crown Office has warned journalists against *further sharing of images* (""koyee mazeed tabsarah nahein kiya jaye gaa kam az kam farde jurm aayed karnay tak""). This indicates that sharing images is what is being restricted until the formal charge (farde jurm) is filed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mazeed tabsrey (Further commentary):** While the Crown Office asks for no further comment, the main focus of concern is the images.
*   **C: Ainy shahadat key mobahissey (Discussions of legal evidence):** The passage mentions legal evidence being potentially compromised, but it's not the thing being actively *prevented* from going beyond the charge.
*   **D: Mazmoon ki ishaatein (Sharing of content):** This is too broad. The passage specifically focuses on *images*.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sealer key liye haaliyah masalah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Baraf ki miqdaar** (Amount of ice).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pitt meen key mutaabiq, peak ice kee miqdar aur motayi pichlay 15 salon mein abb tak mehr kunindgan key liye sab say badtareen rahee hay.""  This translates to: ""According to Pitt meen, the amount and thickness of peak ice has been the worst for fur traders in the last 15 years.""

While the thickness of the ice is *mentioned* alongside the amount, the primary problem for the sealers (mehr kunindgan - fur traders) is specifically described as the *amount* of ice being the worst in 15 years.  The bad weather is a contributing factor (mentioned in the first sentence), but the specific issue for the sealers is the ice itself.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sakht mosam ki surate haal** (Bad weather conditions) - This is a factor, but not the *direct* problem the sealers faced.
*   **C: Baraf ka motaapa** (Thickness of ice) -  The passage mentions thickness *with* amount, but doesn't single it out as the primary issue.
*   **D: Pighalta baraf** (Melting ice) -  The passage doesn't mention melting ice; it focuses on the *amount* and *thickness* of existing ice.



"
"Baraf key saath, bachao ki koshishon ko aur kiya cheez motassir kar rahi thee?","The correct answer is **B: Mosam ki surate haal (Weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*intehayi namuafiq mosami halaat* nay bachanay kee koshishon mein rukawatein paida kee hain"" (extremely unfavorable weather conditions have hindered rescue efforts).  It also mentions that conditions aren't expected to improve soon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samaan ki kami (Lack of equipment):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of equipment.
*   **C: Madad ki kami (Lack of help):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of help.
*   **D: Sealer:** This is irrelevant to the passage's context.



"
Kis aqeedah ki jawaz dahi karney sey Roberts ney parhez kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Zindagi ki shuruaat (The beginning of life)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Robbots nay iss baabat kuchh kahnay say saaf inkaar kiya kehh zindagi kab shuroo hoti hay..."" (Robbots clearly refused to say when life begins...).  This directly indicates he avoided expressing an opinion on when life starts, which is a crucial question in the ethics of abortion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cason parr bahas karney ki ikhlaaqiyat (The ethics of discussing cases):** While he said it would be unethical to give an opinion on *potential* cases, his primary refusal was about the fundamental question of when life begins.
* **B: Adaalatey Aaliyah key mosalsal faisalon ki ahmiyat (The importance of consistent Supreme Court decisions):** He *affirmed* the importance of Supreme Court rulings (""row wee weed hee """"mulk kaa muqarrarah qanoon"""" hay""), he didn't avoid expressing a belief about it.
* **D: Razdaari ka haque (The right to privacy):** He *confirmed* his belief in the right to privacy (""unhon nay bhee yeah tasdiq kee kehh woh razdari key haq key zaruri honey parr yaqeen rakhtay hain..."").



"
Konsa mauzu Roberts key ihsaas mein itna ikhlaaqi thaa kehh uss parr bahas nahein ki ja sakti?,"The correct answer is **D: Cason ki takhsisaat (Details of potential cases)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Robbots nay iss baabat kuchh kahnay say saaf inkaar kiya kehh zindagi kab shuroo hoti hay, jo isqaate hamal kee akhlaqiyat key zimn mein eek ahem sawaal hay. uss nay kahaa kehh **mohtamil cason kee moshakhkhas tafasil parr raaye zany gair akhlaqi hogi.**"" 

This translates to: ""Robots clearly refused to say anything about when life begins, which is an important question in the ethics of abortion. He said that giving an opinion on the **specific details of potential cases** would be unethical.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Adaalatey Aaliyah key faisalon ka tasalsul (The succession of Supreme Court decisions):** While Roberts affirms the importance of Supreme Court precedent (""row wee weed hee """"mulk kaa muqarrarah qanoon"""" hay""), he doesn't say discussing *that* is unethical.
*   **B: Roe v. Wade ka faislah (The decision of Roe v. Wade):** He acknowledges Roe v. Wade, but doesn't frame discussing it as unethical.
*   **C: Nafiz kardah razdaari ka haque (The enforced right to privacy):** He affirms the importance of privacy rights, but doesn't state discussing them is unethical.



"
Bijlee chamakney ki do kadiyaan kahaan hoti hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Aasmaan ki taraf** (Towards the sky).

The passage states: ""Do light beam aisi nasab kee gayee hain jinn kaa rukh raat bhar asmaan kee jaanib rehta hay."" This directly translates to ""Two light beams are installed whose direction remains towards the sky throughout the night.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shahar mein** (In the city) - While the event happens *in* the city, the beams are directed *out* of it.
* **C: Pahley tayyarah key hadaf parr** (At the first plane's target) - The passage mentions the time of the attack but doesn't say the beams are pointed *at* the target.
* **D: Yadgaar park key darmiyaan mein** (Between the memorial park) - The memorial park is near the location, but the beams are pointed upwards.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, uss maqam mein aasmaan key naye daagh kabb banaye kiye jaatey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Raat mein**.

The text states: ""Do light beam aisi nasab kee gayee hain jinn kaa rukh **raat bhar** asmaan kee jaanib rehta hay."" (Two light beams have been installed whose direction remains towards the sky **throughout the night**.)

Therefore, the new marks on the sky (presumably from the light beams) are made at night."
Konsi malumaat tajweez karti hay kehh saton bahnein gaar hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Darjaye hararat key motagayyaraat (Temperature variations)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that infrared images show the ""seven sisters"" exhibit temperature differences between day and night, *similar to caves*.  It explains they are cooler during the day and warmer at night than the surrounding surface. This fluctuating temperature behavior is a key indicator of cave-like structures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gaar key daakhli raaston ka diameter (Diameter of cave entrances):** The passage *mentions* the size of the entrances, but doesn't say this is *evidence* they are caves. It's a descriptive fact, not a supporting reason.
* **C: Arziyati Survery (Survey findings):** The mention of the USGS and Northern Arizona University team is about *interpreting* the data, not the data itself.
* **D: Zameen parr gaaron ki tasaaweer (Images of caves on Earth):**  The comparison to Earth caves is used to highlight the *difference* in temperature stability - the ""seven sisters"" don't hold temperature as well, suggesting a different structure.  It's not evidence *for* them being caves.



"
Saton bahnon key thermal rawayyey ka kaisey moshahidah kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: infrared tasaweer (infrared images)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Infraraid images say zahir hota hay kehh din aur raat key temperature key ikhtelafat zahir kartay hain kehh woh donon ghaaron key manind hain.**"" (Infrared images show the differences in day and night temperatures, revealing they are similar to both houses).

This directly indicates that the thermal behavior of the Seven Sisters is observed through infrared images.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zameen mein gahrey suraakh (Deep holes in the ground)** - While the passage mentions the holes are deep, it doesn't say that *observing* their thermal behavior happens through them. It says the holes *explain* the thermal behavior.
* **C: Gaaron ka diameter (Diameter of the houses)** - The diameter is mentioned as a size characteristic, not a method of observing thermal behavior.
* **D: Zameen parr gaaron key Survey (Survey of the houses on the ground)** -  The passage doesn't state a ground-based survey is used to observe their thermal properties. It highlights infrared imaging.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mushtabah key barey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Hukkaam uski nasal ko jaantey hein** (Officials know his ethnicity).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Uss fard kaa naam hukkaam key liye abb bhee naa malum hay agarcha unn ko malum hay kehh uss kaa taalluq awaighoor nasli garoh say hay.""  This translates to: ""The name of the person is still unknown to officials, although they know that he belongs to a white supremacist group.""  While they know *which* group he's affiliated with (white supremacist), they don't know his specific ethnicity/race.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Hamlah key doraan usney eek gaadi istemaal ki thee** (He used a vehicle during the attack) -  The text says he drove his three-wheeled vehicle into the crowd (""uss shakhs nay hasbe eddeaa dhamaka khaiz mawaad say lady apni teen pahiyon waali gaadi ko hojum mein ghusa diyaa"").
* **B: Mobaiyanah tor parr usney eek dhamakah kiya thaa** (He demonstrably carried out an explosion) - The text states ""hasbe eddeaa dhamaka khaiz mawaad"" (allegedly explosive materials) were used, implying an explosion occurred.
* **D: Wohh zakhmi nahein hua thaa** (He was not injured) - The text states, “Dhamakay mein zakhmi shakhs ko dhamaka karnay waale mashkook shakhs key tor parr heraasat mein lia gayaa hay.” (The injured person in the blast was taken into custody as a suspect in the explosion). This means *someone* was injured, but doesn't state the perpetrator was injured.



"
Hamlah ki babat kiss malumaat ki hukkaam ney tasdique ki hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Mushtabah ki nasal** (The suspect's ethnicity).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Uss fard kaa naam hukkaam key liye abb bhee naa malum hay agarcha unn ko malum hay kehh uss kaa taalluq awaighoor nasli garoh say hay."" This translates to ""The identity of the individual is still unknown to authorities, although they know he belongs to a white supremacist group.""

Therefore, the authorities *have confirmed* the suspect's ethnicity (his affiliation with a white supremacist group).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kisi sathiyon ki shanaakhtein** (Suspects' statements) - The text doesn't mention any statements from accomplices.
*   **C: Hamlah key pichey ka moharrik** (The motive behind the attack) - The text doesn't provide any information about the motive.
*   **D: Mushtabah ka pahla aur akhri naam** (Suspect's first and last name) - The text explicitly states the suspect's name is *not* known.



"
Ellis Park key match mein konsi teamein khelein gee?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa aur Australia** (South Africa and Australia).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Series kaa hatmi match aglay haftay johannesburg mein ails park mein hoga, jab spring boks australia key saath khelein gay."" (The final match of the series will be next week in Johannesburg at Ellis Park, when the Springboks play Australia).

*   ""Springboks"" is a nickname for the South African rugby team.
*   The passage explicitly mentions Australia as the opposing team in the Ellis Park match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tamaam siyaah faam aur Australia** (All Blacks and Australia) - The All Blacks already played their final match against South Africa.
*   **B: New Zealand aur South Africa** (New Zealand and South Africa) - This match already happened, and South Africa won.
*   **D: Springboks aur tamaam siyaah faam** (Springboks and All Blacks) - This match already happened, and South Africa won.



"
Springboks apna agla match kahaan kheley gee?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Series kaa hatmi match aglay haftay johannesburg mein ails park mein hoga, jab spring boks australia key saath khelein gay."" (The final match of the series will be next week in Johannesburg at Ellis Park, when the Springboks play against Australia.)



"
Mission key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiskey saath khalaayi station ko prishaani hui thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek gyroscope ko barqarar rakhnaa (Maintaining a gyroscope)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states ""Pehle khalayi station mission mein eek **jeero scope key noqsan** key bawajood..."" which translates to ""Despite a failure of **a gyroscope** in the first space station mission..."".  This means the space station experienced a problem *with* a gyroscope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thrusters sey sahee faasley ka nazm karnaa (Managing the correct distance with thrusters):** While the passage mentions altitude adjustment thrusters, it doesn't state they *caused* a problem. They were used to *correct* something.
* **C: Tayyarah ki faaliyat (Aircraft operation):** The passage only mentions ground control activating jet readiness, not that aircraft operation was a problem.
* **D: Aam rawayyah ko dobarah hasil karnah (Re-establishing normal attitude):** This was the *result* of fixing the problem, not the problem itself. The station *recovered* its attitude.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khalayi station key mission ka maqsad kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Eek khalayi chalat firat ko mokammal karnaa** (To complete a space journey/movement).

Here's why:

The passage states the space station ""maintained its attitude until orbital parameters were restored."" This means the mission was to *continue operating in space* despite a problem (the gyroscope failure), and to regain control of its orbit. This points to the overall goal being a space journey or operation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gumshudah gyroscope ko talaash kranaa** (To search for a missing gyroscope) - The passage mentions a *loss* of a gyroscope, not a search for one.
*   **B: Motabiqat key thrusters sey qreeb honaa** (To approach with alignment thrusters) - The thrusters were *used* to adjust altitude, they weren’t the goal of the mission.
*   **D: Tayyaron ko faal karna** (To activate preparations) - Activating preparations is part of the process, not the overall mission objective.



"
Case key barey mein konsa dajah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL ko charge kiya gaya thaa** (AOL was charged).

Here's why:

The passage states AOL *witnessed* the accusations (AOL kaa mustaqar hay aur jis nay inn ittehamat ko shah di) - meaning they provided testimony. It doesn't say AOL was charged itself. The case was filed in Virginia because AOL is headquartered there, a penalty was given (someone was convicted), and the case used the law against unwanted bulk email (spam).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Iss parr uss riyasat mein moqddamah chalaya gaya thaa jahaan AOL ka headquarter hay** (This was tried in the state where AOL's headquarters are) - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **B: Eek saza di gayee thee** (A punishment was given) - The passage says someone was convicted by the court, implying a punishment.
*   **C: Fozul email key baarey mein qanoon sazi ka case mein istemaal kiya gaya thaa** (Legislation about unwanted email was used in the case) - The passage explicitly states the case uses the 2003 law against spam.



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr case ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL ko gair matlub taqseem key saath charge kiya gaya thaa** (AOL was charged with unwanted distribution).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the case was filed against AOL, a major internet service provider, and that they admitted to the allegations. The allegations relate to sending unwanted bulk email (spam), which is ""gair matlub taqseem"" (unwanted distribution).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Case mein do sarkardah internet khidmat faraham kunindah shaamil they** (The case involved two major internet service providers) - The passage only mentions AOL.
*   **C: Case parr 2003 mein moqaddamah chalaya gaya thaa** (The case was tried in 2003) - The passage states the law was *passed* in 2003, but doesn't say the case was tried then.  It says this is the first conviction *under* that law.
*   **D: AOL ney case key moqaddamah kaa aagaz kiya thaa** (AOL initiated the case) - The passage says AOL *admitted* to the allegations, implying they were the defendant, not the initiator.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Vidal teen season pahley tak kis club key liye kheltey they?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states: ""28 salah vaidaal nay sevilla say teen season qabal barsa ko join kiya thaa"" which translates to ""28-year-old Vidal joined from Sevilla three seasons ago.""

Therefore, before joining his current club, Vidal played for Sevilla."
Barça key liye Vidal ney kitney game kheley hein?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states ""Catalin-capital ko muntaqil honey key baad wadaal nay uss club key liye 49 game khelay.""  ""Catalin-capital"" refers to Barcelona (often called Barça). Therefore, Vidal played 49 games for Barça."
Match mein mokhalif team kon thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states: ""Jaariq dunn key awwal hissay mein Itly key kofratshiyano mein waqat say pehle kee tarbiyat mein mashq karr rahay they... woh bolonia key khelaaf attwaar ko honey waale muqabilay say pehle team hotel mein qeyaam pazeer they.""  This directly translates to ""Jaariq Dunn was training with Italy's coaches... they were staying at the team hotel before the match against Bolonia on Sunday.""

Therefore, Bolonia is the opposing team mentioned in the passage.



"
Jarque hotel mein kion qiyaam kar rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Uskaa Itwaar ko eek match thaa** (He had a match on Sunday).

Here's why:

The passage states Jaariq and his team were ""qeyaam pazeer"" (staying) at the team hotel ""before the match against Bologna on Sunday."" This directly indicates the reason for their stay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Usney practice ki thee** (He practiced) - While he was *practicing*, the passage doesn't say practice was the *reason* for being at the hotel.
*   **B: Usney season sey pahley mulaqaat ki thee** (He had a pre-season meeting) - The passage doesn't mention anything about a pre-season meeting.
*   **D: Wohh Bolonia key saath tarbiyat ley rahaa tha** (He was training with Bologna) - He was training *before* the match *against* Bologna, not *with* them. They are opponents.

Jakarta ki geophysics agency keon koyi tanbih jaari nahein ki?,"The correct answer is **D: Usney zalzalah ki shiddat ki zarurat ko puraa nahein kiya thaa** (It did not meet the requirement of the earthquake's intensity).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sonami kee koyee warning jaari nahein kee jaye gee kiyon kehh zalzalah 6.5 magnitude kee shart parr pooraa nahein utarta."" (No tsunami warning will be issued because the earthquake does not meet the 6.5 magnitude requirement).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sunaami ka koyi khatrah nahein thaa** (There was no tsunami threat) - This is a *result* of why no warning was issued, not the reason *why* the agency didn't issue it.
*   **B: Bashindgaan key darmiyaan khauf sey bachney key liye** (To prevent fear among residents) - While reducing fear is a good thing, it's not the agency's primary reason for issuing (or not issuing) warnings. They base it on scientific data.
*   **C: Maqami karobaaron parr asar sey bachney key liye** (To avoid impact on local businesses) -  The agency's job is public safety, not protecting businesses.



"
Ebarat key hisaab sey zalzalah ki wajah sey kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Maqaami logon ko khauf mein daal diya thaa (Local people were frightened)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *despite* there being no tsunami warning, residents *became frightened* and started leaving their businesses and homes. The earthquake caused fear amongst the locals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eek sunaami ka khatrah (A tsunami threat):** The passage explicitly states there was *no* tsunami threat.
*   **C: Eek jaari kardah tanbih (An issued warning):**  The passage specifically says *no warning was issued*.
*   **D: Shiddat key paimaney parr eek 6.5 (A 6.5 on the intensity scale):** While the passage mentions the earthquake's magnitude was 6.5, it doesn't describe *what happened* because of it, only *why* a warning wasn't issued. The *effect* was fear.



"
Inmein sey kon suraj aur tamaam deegar sayyaron ki sargarmi ka moharrik hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Roshni aur plasma ka bahao (Light and plasma flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""nizam mein mojud tamaam setaron kee srgarmi kisee aur cheez say nahein, balkeh unn kee roshni aur gardish say mutissir payee gayee.""  This directly translates to: ""The activity of all stars in the system is not due to anything else, but is facilitated by their light and rotation/flow.""
* **Plasma flow (gardish)** is also linked to the ""Raasbi adad"" (Rossby number) mentioned in the text, which relates to magnetic activity driven by plasma movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gulaabi number, ghumao, aur shadeed baraksiyaan (Pink number, rotation, and severe contrasts):** ""Gulaabi number"" is not mentioned in the passage.  While rotation (ghumao) is relevant, ""severe contrasts"" are not.
* **C: Ghumao aur roshni (Rotation and light):** This is partially correct, but doesn't include the important component of *plasma flow* which drives the magnetic activity.
* **D: Roshni, Rossby number, aur ghumao (Light, Rossby number, and rotation):** While Rossby number *relates* to the activity, the passage states light and rotation/flow are the *drivers* of the activity, not simply components to measure it with.



"
Kisi sitaarey key Rossby number ka tayyun kaisey hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Roshni aur ghumao (Brightness and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Setaray key raasbi number kaa tayeen karnay key liye uss kee chamak aur gardish ko eek saath istemaal kiya jaataa hay...""  This directly translates to ""To determine a star's Rossby number, its brightness and rotation are used together.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Plasma bahao ki miqdaar (Amount of plasma flow):** While plasma flow *relates* to the Rossby number, the passage states brightness and rotation are *used to calculate* it.
* **C: Sargarmi ki satah (Level of activity):**  Activity is a *result* of the Rossby number, not used to calculate it.
* **D: Shdeed ulat palat ki miqdaar (Amount of intense fluctuation):** This is related to magnetic activity which is *affected* by the Rossby number, but isn't how it's determined.



"
Australia key fauri jamhuriyah bananey mein himaayat karney waaley servery kardah kitney feesad log they?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 feesad**.

The text states: ""Raaye sanji kee do intehayi hadon parr sarway kiyey gaye afraad kee **29 feesad taadad** kaa khayal thaa kehh jitni jald mumkin ho australia ko republic banaa diyaa jaye..."" 

This directly answers the question about the percentage of people surveyed who support Australia becoming a republic *as soon as possible*."
"Julie Gillard key hisaab sey, Australia ko jamhuri kabb banana chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Queen Elizabeth II key ahad key baad**.

The passage states: ""Oburi wazir aazam joliya glard nay 2010 key wafaqi intekhaab kee muhim key doraan daawaa kiya thaa kehh unn kaa manna hay kehh australia ko malkah elzabeth dom key dore hukumat key ikhtetam parr awami jamhuria bann jaana chahiye."" 

This translates to: ""During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believes Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth ends."""
Konsi tanzeen qanooni tafteesh ke taht hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mansubah band waldiyat (Suspended Waldiyat)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*jo tanzimon ko grant yaa maali kafalat mamnua hogi jo qanuni taftish key dairah mein hain.* Waldiyat kee mansubah bandi mein paison key kharch karnay aur uss kee report karnay say mutalliq zer eltawaa taftish kee wajah say comin kee policy nay mansubah band waldiyat ko na ahal qaraar day diyaa hay...""

This directly translates to: ""...grants or financial support will be prohibited to organizations that are under legal investigation. Due to the ongoing investigation regarding spending money and reporting within the suspended Waldiyat, Comin's policy has deemed the suspended Waldiyat ineligible...""

Therefore, **Mansubah band Waldiyat** is the organization under legal investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ghrelu energy aur iqtesaadi committee (House Energy and Economic Committee)** - This committee is *conducting* the investigation, not *under* it.
*   **B: Komen Foundation** - While mentioned in the passage, it's the entity initiating the policy change, not the one being investigated.
*   **D: Nigraani aur tafteeshaat ki zaili committee (Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee)** - Similar to option A, this committee is investigating, not being investigated.



"
Cliff Stearns kis committee key sarbarah they?,"The correct answer is **A: Ghrelu energy aur iqtesaadi committee** (House Energy and Commerce Committee).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Sterns iss baat kee tehqiqat karr rahay hain kehh aaya nigraan aur zeli taftishi committee key chairman jo **house energy aur commerce committee kee chhatri key taht** hain, kee haisiyat say unhon nay mansubah band waldiyat key zariah mahsulaat kaa istemaal isqaat hamal fund keliye to nahein kiya.""

This directly translates to ""Sterns is investigating whether, as chairman of the oversight and investigative committee **under the House Energy and Commerce Committee**, he used funds from restricted endowments for a pro-life fund.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Komen Foundation:** The passage mentions the Komen Foundation, but Cliff Stearns was not its head.
*   **C: Mansubah band waldiyat (Restricted endowments):** This is what Stearns was *investigating* regarding potential misuse, not the committee he led.
*   **D: Nigraani aur tafteeshaat ki zaili committee (Oversight and investigative committee):** While Stearns *chaired* this committee, it operated *under* the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  The broader committee is the correct answer.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Swiss khaatun key saath kiya nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Uska chori shudah samaan baziyaaft kia gaya thaa (Her stolen belongings were recovered)**.

Here's why:

The text states the police *recovered* stolen laptops and phones and arrested people for *assisting* a Swiss woman (""ismat rezi karnay"" implies assisting/involving her in something undesirable, likely a crime, but doesn't state *what* crime was committed *to* her).  It doesn't mention her being killed (B), sexually assaulted (C - ""ismat rezi"" is a complex phrase, but doesn't directly translate to sexual assault *being done to her*), or that her phone and laptop *were still* stolen (D - they were recovered).

The passage focuses on the recovery of the stolen items and the arrest of those involved in *helping* the Swiss woman, not on a crime *committed against* her directly.



"
2007 mein kis company ko Taiwan key Sustainable Award sey nawaza gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage states: ""Aawsis ko jamhuria cheen key executive yawaan key zariah 2007 taiwan payedar award diye jaaney key baad..."" which translates to ""ASUS was awarded the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award by the executive yuan of the Republic of China...""

Therefore, ASUS is the company that received the award in 2007.



"
ASUS Eee PC kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek laptop**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Aawsis ko ... laptop computer say judaa saarfin kaa bazaar yaksar mukhtalif aur tabdil shudah hoga."" (ASUS... the market for surfing with laptop computers will be drastically different and changed).  This clearly indicates that ASUS is related to laptop computers.  The passage also references the launch of an ASUS *computer* in 2007, which strongly implies a laptop.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek smartphone** - The passage doesn't mention smartphones.
*   **C: Eek tablet** - Tablets weren't as prevalent in 2007 as laptops.
*   **D: Eek pager** - Pagers were already becoming obsolete in 2007.



"
Gumshudah post ki dastavezaat key liye kon zimmah daar thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek ladka** (A boy).

Here's why:

The passage states the boy printed over 600 postal documents, including 429 old postcards that hadn't reached their recipients. This is the direct cause of the missing/delayed post.  While the post office apologized, the *reason* for the problem was the boy's actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Post key karkunaan** (Postal workers): They apologized for the issue, but weren't the cause of it.
*   **B: Obanazawa bashindagaan ki eek jamaat** (A group of Obanazawa residents): They *complained* about the missing cards, they didn't cause them to go missing.
*   **D: Media:** The media simply reported on the issue.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, gumshudah dastavezaat key baarey mein kisney maazerat jaari ki thee?","The correct answer is **D: Obanazawa ki post office**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kal dak khane nay shahriyon aur media key saamney apni muazirat pesh kee.""  This directly translates to ""yesterday, the post office presented its apologies to the citizens and media."" 

Therefore, it was the post office that apologized for the missing documents.
"
Del Potro ko apney kandhey ki prishani ka kabb saamna karna padaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Doosrey set key doraan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Potro nay iss noqtah parr apnay shanah kaa elaaj karaya lekin khel key maidan mein wapas aaney key qaabil ho gayaa."" (Potro had his shoulder treated at this point but became capable of returning to the field of play.) This happened *after* he reached 6-6 in the second set and needed a tie break. Therefore, his shoulder issue occurred *during* the second set."
Pahley tie break kaa natijah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Yehh Murray ney pahley set mein gum kar diya thaa** (Murray lost it in the first set).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baad iss key kehh donon afraad nay seat key harr eek serve ko jeet lia, tie break key natijah mein **maray pehla seat haar gayaa**.""  This translates to ""After this, both players won every serve in each set, but Murray lost the first set in the tie break.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says Del Potro *received treatment* for his shoulder, not that he lost the tie break *because* of it.
* **C & D:** The passage clearly states Murray lost the *first* tie break, not that either player won the second.



"
"Jaisa kehh ebarat mein bayan kiya gaya hay, kisko, khaas tor parr, eek mareez key samney beneqaab kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Bachchey (Children)**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"aaj hamein malum huwa kehh baaz school jaaney kee umar key bachay uss mareez say raabtay mein paaye gaye hain.""""  This directly translates to ""today we learned that some school-aged children were found to have been in contact with the patient."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Governor:** The governor is *reporting* the information, not being exposed.
*   **C: Texas key afsaraan (Texas officials):** The text doesn't say officials were exposed.
*   **D: Maqami shahri (Local citizens):** While the governor is reassuring citizens, the specific exposure mentioned is to children.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, governor ney Texas key shahriyon ko khitaab kartey waqt kiya yaqeen dahaani karayee thee?","The correct answer is **A: System achchey sey kaam kra rahaa hay** (The system is working properly).

Here's why:

The passage states: “yaqeen rakhein hamara nizam isee tarah kam karr rahaa hay jis tarah usay karnaa chahiye.” This directly translates to ""Rest assured, our system is working the way it should.""  This is the governor's reassurance to the citizens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Logon ka tahaffuz bachaney key liye kaam kiye jaa rahey hein** (Work is being done to protect people) - While true (mentioned in the first sentence), this isn’t the *specific* reassurance the governor gave in the quoted statement.
* **C: Challenge ko puraa karney key liye unhein lais kiya gaya thaa** (They were equipped to complete the challenge) - The governor said some places were *better prepared* for the challenge, not that they were equipped.
* **D: Case sanjeedah nahein hay** (The case is not serious) - The governor explicitly said the situation was ""sanjiidah hay"" (serious).



"
Khabar ka konsa parody zariyah do saabiq UW talabah ney takhlique kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Piyaaz (The Onion)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hack and jaansan... imagined a publication that would satirize the news—and news reporting... The Onion, from its inception, became a real arbiter of satirical news...""  It goes on to describe The Onion's growth and influence.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Colbert Report:** The passage mentions the authors *influenced* shows like Colbert Report, but they didn't create it.
*   **Intekhaabi College:** This refers to the Electoral College and is mentioned as part of a satirical headline *within* The Onion, not as the source itself.
*   **Rozanah ka show (The Daily Show):**  Similar to Colbert Report, it's mentioned as being influenced by the authors, not created by them.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon piyaaz ki khabron key parody sultanat mein shaamil nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek film** (A film).

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions these elements as part of The Onion's empire:

*   **Eek aalami atlas** (A global atlas) - ""aur hall hee mein shuroo kiya gayaa aalimi atlas""
*   **Eek website** - ""uski web site jis nay october maah mein 5,000,000 munfarid zaireen""
*   **Eek chapayi ki tadween** (A print edition) - ""Apnay aaghaz say hee aawneen print edition""

The text *doesn't* mention The Onion producing films. It focuses on print, web, atlas, podcast and a 24-hour news network.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, police kiss cheez ki hifaazat kar rahi thee?","The correct answer is **C: Neechey jaati galee ka dakhli rastah** (Downing Street's internal road).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wazir aazam kee sarkari rehaish gah key daakhli raastay key saamney police kee hifazat waale downing street key white haal parr..."" which translates to ""In front of the Prime Minister's official residence's internal road, police were guarding Downing Street's White Hall..."".  This clearly indicates the police were guarding the access road to the Prime Minister's residence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Trafalgar morabbah (Trafalgar Square)** - The protest *passed by* Trafalgar Square, but the police weren't guarding it initially.
* **B: Spring Forum** - The protest eventually *went towards* the Spring Forum, but it wasn't what the police were initially guarding.
* **D: Azeem Connaught kmaron ka hotel (Grand Connaught Rooms Hotel)** -  Similar to B, the protest went *to* the hotel, not what was being guarded initially.



"
Kiss waqt police ney mozahereen sey tarteeb sey chalney ko kahaa thaa takehh mazeed traffic ki tameer sey bacha ja sakey?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 bajey**.

The text states: ""11:20 bajay police nay ehtejajiyon say kahaa kehh woh sadak chhod karr foot paath parr muntaqil ho jayein kiyon kehh unhein ehtejaj key haq aur badhti huyee traffic key maa bain tawazun qayem karnay kee zaroorat hay.""  This directly translates to ""At 11:20, the police asked the protesters to leave the road and move to the sidewalk because they needed to balance the right to protest and the increasing traffic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 11:00 key aas paas:**  The protest *started* around 11:00, but the police request came later.
* **B: 11:29 bajey:**  At 11:29, the protest had *moved* towards White Hall, not when the police asked them to move.
* **C: 11:00 sey pahley:** The police request happened *after* 11:00."
Dr. Ehud Ur ki jaanib sey ki gayi tahqiq key baarey mein kiya sahee hay?,"The correct answer is **B: kuchh sabiqah diabetes waaley choohey abb mazeed diabetes waaley nahein hein** (Some previously diabetic mice are no longer diabetic).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""unhon nay mazeed bataya kehh, """"abb hamare paas gair ziyabis waale 4 mahinay kee umar key choohay hain jinhein shoogar hojaya karta thaa."""" (They further explained that, ""now we have non-diabetic 4-month-old mice who used to have sugar [diabetes]."") This directly indicates that mice *previously* with diabetes are now *without* diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yehh natayej pahley sey mojud type 1 diabetes key mareezon keliye fayedah mand ho saktey hein** (These results may be beneficial for patients already with type 1 diabetes): The passage specifically states the results *don't* align with people who already have type 1 diabetes (""iss baat ko note kartay hoay kehh inn nataij .kee aise logon say koyee mutabiqat nahein hay jo pehle say type 1 diabetas mean mubtala hain"").
* **C: Wohh pur ummid hay kehh tahqiqaat eek elaaj kaa sabab ban skati hay** (He is hopeful that the research could lead to a cure): Dr. Ur is actually *skeptical* about a cure (""unhein iss baaray mein shakk hay kehh aaya diabetes kaa elaaj kiya jaa sakta hay"").
* **D: kuchh gair diabetes waaley choohey abb diabetes waaley hein** (Some non-diabetic mice are now diabetic): The passage indicates the opposite – previously diabetic mice are now non-diabetic.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Dr. Ur Shakki key baarey mein kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Elaaj key baarey mein deegar mahereen key nazriyaat** (The opinions of other experts regarding treatment).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuchh doosray mahireen kee tarah say, unhein iss baaray mein shakk hay kehh aaya diabetes kaa elaaj kiya jaa sakta hay..."" (Like some other experts, he doubts whether diabetes can be cured...). This directly refers to Dr. Yuaar's skepticism aligning with the views of *other* experts regarding a potential cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agar tahqiqaat type 1 diabetes waley logon key liye mtalliqah hein** (If the research is relevant for people with type 1 diabetes) - The passage explicitly states the results don't align with those *already* having type 1 diabetes.
*   **B: Agar koyi elaaj mumkin ho** (If a cure is possible) - Dr. Yuaar *doubts* a cure is possible, not that it *is* possible.
*   **D: Agar gair diabetes waaley choohey usee trah baqi rahein** (If non-diabetic mice remain the same) - The passage doesn't focus on what happens to non-diabetic mice. It's about diabetic mice and the skepticism around a cure.



"
Konsa darjahg zail bayaniyah durust tor parr parwaaz CG4684 key tasaadum ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Sayyarah key tabaahi key maqaam ki talaash mosam sey motassir hui thee** (The search for the crash site was affected by the weather).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Usee kharab mausam kee wajah say jo landing key mansukhi kaa sabab banaa talashi key kaam mein khalal padaa."" (The bad weather that caused the landing to be cancelled also hindered the search effort.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mosam ki wajah sey sayyarah asal mein lend karney key qabil nahein thaa** (The plane wasn't actually able to land due to the weather) - While the weather *caused* a cancelled landing, it doesn't explain the ultimate crash. The plane attempted to land multiple times.
* **B: Sayyarah eek bahut door key mahalley waqoo mein girkar tabaah hua thaa** (The plane crashed in a very remote location) - The passage does mention the remoteness making rescue difficult, but this isn't the *explanation* for the crash itself.
* **C: Tabaah honay sey pahley sayyarah ney teen baar lend karney ki koshish ki thee** (The plane attempted to land three times before crashing) - The passage only states it was attempting a landing and was ""rocked"" before, but doesn't say how many attempts were made before disappearing.



"
kiss wajah sey parwaaz CG4684 ney apni lending ko saaqit kar diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Mosam ki surate haal kharab thee** (The weather conditions were bad).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Usee kharab mausam kee wajah say jo landing key mansukhi kaa sabab banaa talashi key kaam mein khalal padaa."" which translates to ""The same bad weather that caused the landing to be cancelled also hampered the search efforts."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lend karney ka mahalley waqo naqabile rasayi thaa** (The landing area was inaccessible) - While true *after* the crash, this wasn't the *reason* for the initial aborted landing. It's a consequence, not a cause.
*   **B: CG4684 sey pahley deegar motaddid parwaazein theen** (There were other delayed flights before CG4684) - The passage doesn't mention any other flights.
*   **C: Parwaaz ka rasta Kokoda ki taraf badal diya gayaa thaa** (The flight path was changed to Kokoda) - The passage states the flight *was trying* to land in Kokoda, not that its path was changed.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, Franciszek Kowal key tajrabah key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee hay?","The correct answer is **B: Bilaakhir usko noqsan nahein pahuncha thaa** (He ultimately wasn't harmed).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Zindah bach jaaney waale franceszeek koval nay bataya..."" (The surviving Franciszek Kowal said...). This directly implies he *survived* the event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usney kisi tarah darichah ko tod diya thaa** (He somehow broke the window) - The text says *a* window eventually broke, but doesn't say Franciszek Kowal broke it.
* **C: Bahar nikalney ki koshihs ke doraan usney eek kursi tod dee thee** (He broke a chair while trying to get out) - The text says *people* were hitting the window frames with chairs, not Franciszek Kowal specifically.
* **D: Eek darichah ko todney ki koshish key doraan wohh zakhmi ho gaya thaa** (He was injured while trying to break a window) - The text doesn’t mention any injuries to Franciszek Kowal. It only states he survived.



"
Surataani toofan Danielle key mumkanah asar ki paimaesh karna challenge ka kaam keon thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Toofan landfall sey door hay**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chonkeh toofan land fall say bahut door hay, iss liye riyasathaye muttahedah yaa caribean key mumkanah asraat kaa andazah lagana mushkal lag rahaa hay.""  (Because the storm is far from landfall, it is difficult to estimate the possible effects on the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the prediction of strengthening is relevant, it doesn't explain *why* assessing impact is difficult.
* **B:** The passage doesn't say scientists are uncertain about the wind speeds, only that they *are* at 40 mph.
* **D:** The distance from Miami is a fact about the storm, but it's the distance from *landfall* that makes impact prediction challenging.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, surtaani toofan Danielle key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniya sahee naein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yehh landfall sey qareeb hay (It is close to landfall)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chonkeh toofan land fall say bahut door hay, iss liye riyasathaye muttahedah yaa caribean key mumkanah asraat kaa andazah lagana mushkal lag rahaa hay."" (Because the storm is very far from landfall, it is difficult to estimate the possible effects on the United States or the Caribbean.)

This directly contradicts option D, which claims the storm is *close* to landfall.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Caribbean parr iska asar na maloom hay (Its impact on the Caribbean is unknown):** The passage says it's difficult to estimate impacts on the US *or* the Caribbean due to the distance from land.
* **B: Iski tashkeel Bahre Atlantic mein hui thee (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage states ""Saal 2010 key auqianoos samundari toofani mausam kaa denial naami chotha istewai toofan mashriqi bahar auqianoos mean tashkil paya hay."" (In 2010, the oceanic stormy season, a tropical storm named Danielle formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean).
* **C: Yehh eek samundari toofan mein badal sakta hay (It can develop into a hurricane):** The passage states ""National huricane centre key sciencedanon nay pesh goyee kee hay kehh denial toofan budh key roz thak mazboot hokar samundari aandhi bann sakta hay."" (Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that the Danielle storm could strengthen and become a hurricane by Wednesday).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aalimi wabaa paida karnay say pehle beemari key saath kiya honay ki tajweez dee gayee hay?","The correct answer is **A: Isey lazmi tor parr kam mohlik hona zaruri hay** (It is necessary to make it less lethal).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*kuchh mutaliat batatay hain kehh iss beemari ko aalimi wabaa paida karnay say pehle lazmi tor parr kam jaan leva honaa chahiye*.""  This directly translates to ""some studies suggest that this disease must be made less lethal before it causes a global pandemic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alaamaton ka motadil rahna zaruri hay** (Symptoms need to be moderate) - The passage doesn't say symptoms *need* to be moderate, it focuses on reducing the disease's severity (lethality).
* **C: Mazeed logon ke motassir hona zaruri hay** (More people need to be affected) - The passage warns *against* further spread.
* **D: Bachchey lazmi tor parr alaamaton ka samna karein gay** (Children will inevitably face symptoms) - The passage focuses on the disease's potential to become a pandemic, not specifically on children experiencing symptoms.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, toofan Fujian sey kitna door thaa?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilometer**.

The passage states (P) that the storm was approximately 70 kilometers from the Fujian province (foziyan). 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 9 kilometer** - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **B: 11 kilometer** - This refers to the storm's speed (11 kilometers *per hour*), not its distance from Fujian.
* **D: 77 kilometer** - The text says ""taqriban sattar kilometer"" which means *approximately seventy kilometers*. 70 is closer to the exact number mentioned.



"
George W. Bush key Asia pahuchney parr kisney unko mobarkbaad dee thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng aur Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The passage states that George W. Bush was welcomed by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng *and* had talks with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  Therefore, both welcomed/greeted him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wazeere aazam (Prime Minister)** - Only mentions Lee Hsien Loong, not the full welcoming party.
*   **B: Eek naazir (A minister)** - Too vague; the passage specifically names the Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister.
*   **D: Nayeb wazeere aazam (Deputy Prime Minister)** - Only mentions Wong Kan Seng, not the full welcoming party.



"
Asia kee tejarati tausee key baarey mein sadar ney kabb baat ki thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Apni wast muddati intekhaab ki haaron key baad** (After his midterm election defeat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Darmiyani madad key intekhabat mein haftay bhar shikast khaaney key baad, bush nay nazireen ko asia mein tejarat mein tausee karnay key baaray mein bataya."" This directly translates to: ""After suffering a defeat in the midterm elections, Bush told viewers about expanding trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Singapore pahunchney parr** - While he *did* arrive in Singapore, the passage doesn't say he talked about trade expansion *upon arrival*.
*   **B: Wong Kan Seng key saath** - He discussed trade and terrorism *with* Wong Kan Seng, but the passage doesn't state he *initiated* the conversation about trade expansion then.
*   **D: Asia key apney haftey bhar key purey daurey mein** - The passage indicates the talk happened *specifically* after the election results, not generally throughout the tour.



"
"Ebarar key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey konsa hukumat ka majmooyi maqsad hay?","The correct answer is **D: Zarurat sey ziaydah gaadiyon ki bheed ko kam karna** (To reduce the congestion of excess vehicles).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the government's aim is to alleviate congestion (""bheed bhaad ko rafaa karnay"")**.  They are buying more coaches (vehicles) *in order to* reduce this congestion.
* Option A is too narrow - it just mentions funding, not the *reason* for funding.
* Options B and C focus on the *number* of vehicles, but the core purpose isn't simply acquiring vehicles, it's solving a problem.

Therefore, the overall goal is to reduce overcrowding.



"
Hukumat ney kiya elaan kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Unka ezafi 1,300 gaadiyon ko fund karney ka mansubah hay** (Their plan is to fund an additional 1,300 vehicles).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mazeed 300 coach kee khareed say bheed bhaad ko rafaa karnay key liye khareede gaye dabbon kee mizaan 1300 ho gayee."" (With the purchase of an additional 300 coaches, the number of vehicles purchased to alleviate congestion has reached 1300.)
* This directly indicates the government's plan to fund 1300 vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unka ezafi 300 gaadiyon ko fund karney ka mansubah hay** (Their plan is to fund an additional 300 vehicles) - This only mentions the latest addition, not the total.
* **B: Gaadi key masalah sey raahat paaney ka unka azam hay** (Their aim is to get relief from the vehicle problem) - This is a general statement about their goal, not the specific announcement.
* **D: Zarurat sey ziyadah bheed ka masalah March tak hal ho jaye gaa** (The problem of excessive congestion will be solved by March) - The passage doesn't state a timeline for *solving* the problem, just that funding is increased.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi malumaat malum hay?","The correct answer is **C: Eek hamlah ki tawaqqo hay (An attack is expected)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Us nay kahaa,""""iss baat kee tajweez dena koyee aqalmandi nahein kehh eek hamlah fori tor parr mutawaqqa hay.""  This directly translates to ""He said that it is not wise to propose something when an attack is immediately expected.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khatrey ki satah kam ho gayi hay (The level of threat has decreased):** While the statement *mentions* reducing the severity of the threat level, it doesn't say the level has *gone down*. It says reducing the severity doesn't mean the threat is gone.
* **B: Abb aur koyi khatrah nahein hay (There is no threat now):**  The passage explicitly states the opposite - even reducing the severity doesn't eliminate the threat entirely.
* **D: Intelligence ney tasdeeq ki hay kehh hamlah sakht hogaa (Intelligence has confirmed the attack will be severe):** The passage doesn't mention intelligence confirmation or the severity of the attack, only that an attack is expected.



"
Mozaheron key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sadarati commisssion mozaheron ka jawaab thaa** (The presidential commission was a response to the protests).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""October mean shuroo honey waale hukumat mukhalif muzahiron parr marteli kaa radde amal commission thaa."" This translates to ""Martelly's reaction commission was to the government-opposing protests that began in October.""  This means the *commission was a reaction *to* the protests, not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

* **B: Zaruri intekhabaat sey mozaherey bhadkey they** (Protests were fueled by necessary elections) - The passage states, ""Intekhabat karaaney mean nakami nay waqti pur tashdduad muzahiron ko bhadkaya, kuchh intekhabat 2011 say zer eltawa they."" (Failure to hold elections fueled tense protests, some elections were pending since 2011.)
* **C: Mozaheron mein saabiq CEP key istefaa kaa motalebah thaa** (The protests demanded the resignation of the former CEP) - While not explicitly stated, the context of repeated CEP failures and calls for new elections strongly implies this was a demand.
* **D: Mozaherey baaz auqaat purr tashaddud ho jatey they** (Protests sometimes became violent) - The passage says ""waqti pur tashdduad muzahiron"" (tense/violent protests).



Therefore, option A is the only statement *not* supported by the provided text."
Akhri CEP key istefaa ki kisney tajweez dee thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Sadarati commission ney**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Guzashta maah sadarati commission nay mulk ko nayey intekhabat kee jaanib lay jaaney key liye iqdamat key package key juzw key tor parr cep kee qabal az waqat subukdoshi kee tajweez dye.""  This translates to: ""Last month, the presidential commission proposed the premature resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to take the country towards new elections.""

Therefore, the presidential commission proposed the resignation of the last CEP.



"
"Bayaniyah ke hisaab sey, Ameriki Gymnastics ney khelaadiyon key saath Nassar ki badsoluki key baad kiskee moawanat nhein kee thee?","The correct answer is **C: Tanzeem mein zaruri tabdeeliyaan** (Necessary changes in the organization).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ameriki gymnastics uss key iss biyaan say muttafiq hain kehh hamare khiladiyon aur unn key kalbon key mufadat kee behatar takmeel iss soorat mean ho sakti kehh hamm apni tanzeem hain baa maanee taggaiurat laayein beh nisbat iss key kehh certification ko laghu kiya jaye.""

This translates to: ""American Gymnastics agrees with this statement that the best fulfillment of the interests of our athletes and their well-being can be achieved if we make substantial changes in our organization rather than reducing certification.""

This indicates that American Gymnastics initially resisted making necessary changes within the organization *after* the abuse by Nassar came to light. They preferred to consider reducing certification instead, implying a reluctance to address the deeper systemic issues that allowed the abuse to occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Adame tasdeeq** (Adam's confirmation) - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Eek ba ekhtiyaar mahaul banana** (Creating an empowered environment) - While they *aim* for this, the passage focuses on what they *didn't* do initially.
*   **D: Eek aazad tafteesh** (An independent investigation) - They *support* an investigation *now*, but the question asks what they didn't do *after* the abuse.



"
"Bayaniyah key hisaab sey, Ameriki Gymnastics aur Ameriki Olympic Committee dono key aagey badhney ka asal maqsad kia hay?","The correct answer is **D: Kheladiyon key liye eek mahfooz mahaul farog denaa (To promote a safe environment for athletes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ameriki gymnastics aur USOC kaa eek hee hadaf hay- gymnastics aur deegar khelon ko aithleton keliye mumkanah hadd thak mahfuz banana, taakeh woh apnay khwabon ko mahfuz, musbat aur baa akhtiyar maahaul mean sharmindah taabir karsakein.""  This directly translates to ""American Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes, so that they can fulfill their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Larry Nassar ki badsoluki parr roshni dalnaa (To shed light on Larry Nassar's misconduct)** - While the passage *mentions* the need to investigate how the abuse went undetected for so long, it's a step *towards* the overarching goal of safety, not the goal itself.
*   **B: Adame tasdeeq ka taaqub karnaa (To pursue Adam's certification)** - The passage discusses the possibility of changes to certification, but it's framed as a means to improve athlete safety, not the goal itself.
*   **C: Eek niji tafteesh ka taaqub karnaa (To pursue a private investigation)** - Similar to A, the investigation is a *method* to achieve the goal, not the goal itself.



"
Hadsah key waqea honay key waqt jahaaz kiss traf pesh qadmi karr rhaa thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""yeah jahaaz palawan mean pewarto prencisa mean apnay safar parr gamzan thaa."" This translates to ""the ship was engaged on its voyage from Palawan to Puerto Princesa.""  Therefore, at the time of the incident, the ship was heading *towards* Palawan (or was in the vicinity of Palawan on its way to Puerto Princesa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amerika (America)** - The text mentions the US Navy's Seventh Fleet, but doesn't say the ship was heading *to* America.
*   **B: Puerto Rico** - Puerto Rico is mentioned as the ship’s destination, not its location at the time of the incident.
*   **D: Japan** - Nagasaki, Japan is the ship's home port, not where it was when the incident occurred.



"
Ebarat mein mazkoor jahaaz key baarey mein konsee sahee haqiqat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Yehh Puerto Princesa ki taraf apney raastey mein thaa (It was on its way towards Puerto Princesa)**.

Here's why:

The text states the ship was ""palawan mean pewarto prencisa mean apnay safar parr gamzan thaa"" - meaning it was *engaged in its voyage from Palawan towards Princessa* (likely referring to Puerto Princesa).  However, the text doesn't state it *was* on its way to Puerto Princesa at the time of the incident. It was simply describing its recent journey. This makes option A a misinterpretation of the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the provided text:

* **B: Iskee bunyaad Palawan mein hay (Its base is in Palawan)** - The text explicitly states ""jahaaz palawan mean pewarto prencisa mean apnay safar parr gamzan thaa,"" implying Palawan is its operational area.
* **C: Yehh kaan kuni ka insedaad iqdamaat ka jahaaz hay (It is a ship for Kan Kuni incident operations)** -  ""Eek avenger cliss mine jehaaz ko jawabi tadbir deti hay"" indicates it's involved in responding to the Kan Kuni incident.
* **D: Isey Ameriki bahriyah key saatvein bedaa ko tafweez kiyaa gayaa hay (It was assigned to the American Navy's Seventh Fleet)** - The text states ""uss ko US neevi key saatwein bedah say munsalk kiya gayaa hay,"" meaning it was detached/assigned from the US Navy's Seventh Fleet.



"
Kisney Ameriki faujiyon key baarey mein bayan diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Press secretary**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tawaar key dinn key aakhir mean, amerika key sadar donald trump nay **press secretary key zariah** eek biyaan mean elaan kiya kehh ameriki fauj shaam chhod den gee."" 

This directly translates to: ""At the end of the day, the American president Donald Trump, **through the press secretary**, announced in a statement that the American army would leave Syria.""

While Donald Trump *made the decision*, the *announcement* was delivered *through* his press secretary.



"
"Bayaan ke hisaab sey, kiss mulk ney qaidee ladaakon ki nigraani ka zimmah liya hay?","The correct answer is **D: Turkee**.

The text states: ""Turki ISIS key unn giraftar jang baazon ko bhee guard karay gaa jinn ko europi aqwam nay wapas lenay say inkaar kiya.""  This directly translates to ""Turkey will also guard the captured fighters that European countries refused to take back."" 

Therefore, Turkey has taken responsibility for guarding the prisoners."
Yaqeeni tor parr tasaadum ki kiya wajah hay?,"The most likely answer is **B: Dushmani ki aag (Enemy fire)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""manna jaataa hay kehh dushmanon kee taraf say kee gayee goli baari kaa natijah hay"" which translates to ""it is believed to be a result of firing by the enemy."" This directly points to enemy fire as the cause of the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Sakht khittah (Difficult terrain):** While the terrain *complicates* the search, it's not stated as the *cause* of the crash.
* **C: Pahaadi khittah (Hilly terrain):** Similar to A, this describes the environment, not the cause of the crash.
* **D: Kharaab mosam (Bad weather):**  Bad weather also *hinders* the search, but isn't presented as the reason for the crash itself.



"
Kiss qism key khittah mein tasaadum waqea hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Pahaadi** (Mountainous).

The text specifically states: ""Haadsah oonchi pahadiyon key beach pesh aaya..."" which translates to ""The accident happened near high mountains..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dushmani** (Enemy) - While the text mentions enemy fire *as a possible cause*, it doesn't describe the *type of terrain*.
*   **B: Sakht** (Difficult/Harsh) - This describes the *conditions* of the terrain, not the terrain itself.
*   **C: Ittehaad** (Alliance) - This refers to the forces involved, not the location.



"
Sailaab key natijah key tor parr afsaraan kiya ummid thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandbarz kee bahaali (Restoration of sandbars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""afsaran ko tawaqqo hay kehh yeah dhaar mean behh gaye ret key todah ko behaal karnay keliye kaafi hoga"" which translates to ""officials expect this will be enough to disrupt the sediment buildup in the channel.""  Disrupting the sediment buildup directly relates to affecting the sandbars. The passage earlier explains that sandbars are crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Saahiley samundar banana (Creating coastlines):** While sandbars *contribute* to coastlines, the passage doesn't say officials expect new coastlines to form.
*   **C: humpback chubs ki ezaafi tadaad (Increased number of humpback chubs):** The passage states humpback whales are *threatened*, not that chubs will increase.
*   **D: Jangali zindagi ki ziyaadah rehaaesh gahein (More wildlife habitats):** The passage says habitats were *already* provided by the sandbars, and these habitats are now threatened.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiss parr dam ki tameer mustaqil asar pada thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandbarz**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the *telchhat* (which the dam caused) were **necessary for forming sandbars and coastlines**.  The dam's alteration of the river flow impacted the formation of these sandbars.  The passage goes on to detail how *this* change then affected wildlife and fish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Humpback chubs:** While humpback chubs are *affected* by the dam, they aren't what the dam directly impacted. Their decline is a *result* of the change to the sandbars.
*   **C: Jangali zindagi ki rehaaesh gahein (Wildlife Habitats):** Habitats were affected, but the *direct* impact was on the physical structures (sandbars) that created those habitats.
*   **D: Telchat ka failao (Spread of Telchhat):** The dam *caused* the spread of the telchhat.  The question asks what the dam impacted, not what it created.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney America ko mumkanah khatraat key baarey mein suraag diya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Eek giar Zahir Zariyah** (An undisclosed source).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""U.S. key mutabiq usay eek poshidah zariye say malumat mosul hoyee hain..."" which translates to ""According to the U.S., it received information from an undisclosed source..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Somaliya key shiddat pasand (Somali extremists):** The passage states the warning *is about* Somali extremists, not that they *provided* the information.
* **B: Ethiopia ka safarat khaanah (Ethiopian embassy):** The passage mentions the embassy, but not as the source of the warning.
* **D: Kenya ka eek zariyah (A Kenyan source):** While Kenya is mentioned in the warning, the source is described as undisclosed, not specifically Kenyan.



"
Darjah zail bayaniyah mein sey kon durust tor parr shiddat pasandon key mobaiyyanah hamlah key mansubah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Do mamaalik mein aham maqamat parr bam dhamakey** (Bomb blasts at important locations in two countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kenya aur etheopia mean intehari bom hamlay karnay kee planing karr rahay hain"" (They are planning suicide bomb attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia).  It also mentions targeting ""numayan elaqon"" (prominent areas/locations) – implying important places.
* **Option A** only mentions one country.
* **Option B** simply states bomb blasts in two countries, but doesn't specify *where* the blasts would occur.
* **Option D** only mentions one country.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information presented in the passage about planned bomb attacks at important locations in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia.



"
Darjah zail logon mein sey kon wakeel nahein hay,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Petros Mantouvalos:** The text explicitly states he is a lawmaker (""rukn parliman aur qanoon daan""). However, he was removed from office due to corruption linked to lawyers and legal dealings, suggesting involvement *with* the legal profession, not *as* one.
* **Sakis Kechagioglou:** The text directly identifies him as a lawyer (""Mashhur yunani wuklaa..."").
* **George Nikolakopoulos:**  Also directly identified as a lawyer (""...aur jorge nikolapolis ko..."").
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos:** The text identifies him as a *journalist* (""journalist maakis triantafipolos nay ittelaat ko shaye kiya""). He reported on the scandal, he didn't participate in it as a lawyer.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only person listed who is not a lawyer.



"
Yunani qanooni community mein scandal kaa hissah honay key tor parr logon ki kiss jamaat kaa tazkarah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: solesters**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions the following groups being involved in the scandal over the past years:

*   **Jajon** (Judges)
*   **Wukalaa** (Lawyers)
*   **Attorneez** (Attorneys)

It also specifically mentions a **journalist** (Maakis Triantafipolos) and a **judge** (Aiwanjalos Colosis) being directly involved in recent revelations and consequences.

However, **solesters** (solicitors) are *not* mentioned anywhere in the text as being part of the scandal.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Hindustan ney kitney wicket khoye they,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Leakin captain kee wicket garnay key baad india nay faqat 36 runn banaa karr **7 wiktein gunwa karr** innings kaa khaatima kiya.""  (After the captain's wicket, India made only 36 runs and **lost 7 wickets** to end the innings.)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, uss paari ka sabsey ziyadah score kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: 70 run**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Raabin Uthappa nay sirf 41 gaindon mean 70 runn key saath inning kaa sab say badaa score banaya."" (Raabin Uthappa made the highest score of the innings with 70 runs off 41 balls).

The other options refer to scores made by other players or after the captain's wicket, but none of them are the *highest* score of the innings."
Darjah zail mein sey kon Adam Cuerden ki mayoosi ki wajah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jinsi mashmool key baarey mein site ki nayi policy**

Here's why:

The passage clearly states Adam Cuerden is upset about:

*   **Wales (Wells) lying from the beginning:** ""...*uss [wells] nay darr asl shuroo say hee ham say jhoot bolaa*."" (Wells actually lied to us from the beginning.)
*   **Wells acting legally then deleting content:** ""...*sab say pehle to iss tarah key aqdaam karkay jaise yeah qanuni wajuhaat say ho. dosray number purr, yeah zahir karkay kehh woh hamaari baat sun rehaa hay, bilkul apnay hazaf karnay key funn kee tarah.*"" (First, taking actions as if they were legally justified. Second, pretending to listen to us, like an art of deletion.)
*   **Wells not listening:** ""...*Wales key zariyah na sunaa janaa*."" (Not being heard through Wales).

The passage *mentions* a policy being created regarding sexually explicit material due to community complications, but it **doesn't state that this policy is the cause of Adam Cuerden's frustration**.  He is upset with the actions and dishonesty of ""Wells"".

Therefore, the policy is the only option that isn't directly linked to Cuerden’s disappointment as described in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, site sey kiya hazaf kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: jinsi mashmool (explicit material)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...maqaam key liye jinsi mawaad key hawalay say aisi policy tayaar karnay kee maujudah koshishein hoyein..."" and ""...yeah hamaari baat sun rehaa hay, bilkul apnay hazaf karnay key funn kee tarah.""  This indicates that the site was removing explicit material (""jinsi mawaad"") and the speaker is upset about the way it's being handled – as if they're just pretending to listen while actually deleting it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fan:**  The passage doesn't mention fans being removed.
*   **C: Eek policy ka mosawwadah (A draft of a policy):** The passage discusses *attempts to create* a policy, but not the removal of a policy draft itself.
*   **D: Niji milkiyat waali media (Privately owned media):** The passage mentions media hosted on the platform, but doesn't say that media itself was removed.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiskee Amir Khan himayat nahein kartey?","The correct answer is **A: Olympics mein khawateen ladakon ko shaamil karnaa (Including women fighters in the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Amir Khan believes ""khwateen ko ladna nahein chahiye"" (women should not fight).  This directly translates to him not supporting the inclusion of women fighters in the Olympics.  While he says he'll support British competitors *in* the Olympics, that doesn't mean he supports the principle of women competing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bartanavi hareef (British competitors):** He *does* say he will support British competitors.
* **C: Khawateen key nazriyaat (Women's viewpoints):** The passage doesn't focus on his view of women's *opinions*, but their participation in fighting.
* **D: London ka Olympics ki mezbaani karna (London hosting the Olympics):**  The passage doesn't mention his opinion on London hosting.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiskee apney zaati nazriyah key bawajood Amir Khan himayat kar rahey hongein?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 Olympics**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his personal belief (""zaati tor parr mera khayal hay kehh khwateen ko ladna nahein chahiye""), Amir Khan will support British competitors in the 2012 Olympics in London. This clearly indicates he will be supporting the **2012 Olympics** and the athletes participating in it, even though he doesn't personally agree with women competing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khawateen ladakey (Female fighters)** - He explicitly states he doesn't think women *should* fight, so he wouldn't be supporting them.
*   **B: 2004 key Olympics key unkey saathi hareef (His fellow competitors from the 2004 Olympics)** - The passage doesn't mention any support for his past competitors.
*   **D: Deegar chaandi key medal yaftagaan (Other silver medalists)** - The passage only mentions his own silver medal, not any intention to support other silver medalists.



"
Peter Lenz ki wafaat kabb hui thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Aspataal mein** (In the hospital).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...jahaan baad mein woh wafaat pagaya"" which translates to ""...where later he succumbed to his injuries/passed away."" This clearly indicates he died *after* being taken to the hospital.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Warm-up daurah key doraan (During the warm-up lap):** He fell during the warm-up lap, but didn't die *during* it.
* **B: Apni bike sey girney key baad (After falling off his bike):** He fell, then collided, then was taken to the hospital.  The fall itself wasn't the cause of death.
* **D: Jabb wohh track parr tibbi amalah key saath thaa (When he was on the track with the medical team):** The medical team provided initial care *on* the track, but he died at the hospital.



"
Zeveer ziyaat kon hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek deegar daud laganey walaa** (Another racer).

The text states: ""...apnay muqabilah karnay waale saathi zeveer ziyaat say takra gayaa."" which translates to ""...collided with his competitor Zeveer Ziyaat.""

Therefore, Zeveer Ziyaat is another racer.



"
Eek sayyarah key dakhli kaamon ko samajhney sey mumkanah tor parr fayedah haasil karney walaa prishaan parwaaz karney walaa kis haalt mein hoga?,"The correct answer is **B: Aya udaan ka unkaa darr namaloom cheez key darr key aas paas markooz hay**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help people control their fear, *which is based on the unknown or a feeling of lack of control*.  Option B directly addresses this point – that the passenger's fear of flying is rooted in a fear of the unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aya mosaafir unkey darr sey sharmindah hein:**  The passage explicitly says there's *no shame* in being afraid to fly.
* **C: Aya mosaafir tamaam qism key transportation key khilaaf hein:** The passage focuses specifically on fear of *flying*, not all forms of transportation.
* **D: Aya takleef dahh hadsaat sey tanee unki parishaani udaan sey motalliqah nahein hay:**  The passage discusses fear even in the absence of a prior traumatic incident. It acknowledges a previous bad experience *could* contribute, but the fear can exist independently.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kisey qimat sey aagah mosaafir ko akhir mein karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Airline ki website check karey**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...aur booking say pehle mutaliqah air line kee web site ko zaroor dekhein"" (and definitely check the relevant airline's website before booking).  This means the final step a price-conscious traveler should take is to check the airline's website directly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Motaddid travel companiyon ki peshkashon ko talaash karey (Search offers from multiple travel companies):** The passage suggests *comparing* results, not just searching through travel companies.
* **B: Brahe raast airline sey book karey (Book directly with the airline):** While potentially a good idea, the passage emphasizes checking the price *on* the airline's website *before* booking, not just booking directly.
* **C: Motaddid travel companiyon key darmiyaan qimaton ka mowaznah karey (Compare prices between multiple travel companies):** The passage mentions comparing search results, but highlights the *airline's website* as the crucial final check.



"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, mosaafiron ko behtareen mumkanah parwaaz ki qimaton ko mahfooz karney key liye sabsey pahley kiya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Mukhtalif jamaa kunindagaan key darmiyaan qimaton ka mowaznah karein (Compare prices across different aggregators)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baaz auqaat eek hee flight kee mukhtalif web site parr bahut mukhtalif qeematein ho sakti hain aur eek fayede kee baat yeah kehh search nataij kaa mowaznah karein..."" (Sometimes the same flight can have very different prices on different websites and a good thing is to compare search results...).

While checking the airline's website directly is *also* advised (and mentioned in the passage as something to do *after* comparing), the first step for getting the best price is to *compare* prices across different sites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Airline ki website check karey (Check the airline's website):**  The passage says to do this *after* comparing results, not first.
*   **C: Brahe raast airline key zariyah book karein (Book directly through the airline):** The passage warns against blindly booking directly without comparing.
*   **D: Brahe raast kisi travel agent key saath book karein (Book directly with a travel agent):** The passage doesn't mention travel agents at all.

Kabb kisi saathi ko kisi tarseel key saath jaana darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Jabb cheezein check kardah samaan key tor parr bheji jaa rahi hon** (When items are being sent as checked baggage).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Usay jaldi say haasil karnay kaa waahid rasta yeah thaa kehh usay registered saamaan key tor parr bheja jaataa."" (The only way to get it quickly was to send it as registered baggage.)  It also explains that airlines won't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger. Therefore, to ensure speed, the item *must* be sent as checked baggage, meaning someone needs to accompany it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jabb cheezein maal bardaar jahaaz key zariyah bheji jayein** (When items are sent by cargo ship) - The passage specifically points out that cargo ships are *slow* and cause delays.
* **B: Jabb company apney khud key sayyarey istemaal karey** (When a company uses its own vehicles) - This isn’t mentioned as requiring accompaniment.
* **D: Jabb tarseel ko koyi badi company sanbhaal rahi ho** (When a large company is handling the delivery) - While large companies might have established routes, the passage identifies the speed issue for *all* routes not using those established systems, not specifically relating to large companies.

"Ebaarat ki buniyaad parr, kisi ittehaad mein aksar parwaaz karney waali kisi airline ka intekhaab kartey waqt, darjah zail mein sey kisko tarjeeh dena chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Sabsey ziyadah points peshkash karney waali airline**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while it might *feel* natural to choose the airline you fly most often, you should actually consider which airline offers the **most advantageous rewards** (points) within the alliance.  It points out that frequent flyer points can differ between airlines within the same alliance and that a different airline might offer *more* beneficial rewards for the same amount of flying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baday ittehaad waali airline:** The size of the alliance isn't the focus; it's the benefits *within* the alliance.
* **C: Jiss airline sey aap bahut ziyadah safar kartey hein:** The passage warns *against* solely relying on this factor.
* **D: Wohh airaline jsmein ezaafi reaayaton ka shaamil honaa mumkin ho:** While extra benefits are good, the passage specifically highlights the *points* offered as the key consideration for maximizing value within an alliance.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kon ziyadah tarr parwaaz karney waley ki points ki peshkash kar sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mukhtalif ittehaad mein aapki sabsey ziyadah safar ki jaaney waali airline**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yeah kehh ziyadah safar karnay waalon key point eek hee air line ittehad key taht kisee doosri air line key ziyadah fayyazana ho saktay hain."" 

This translates to: ""...that the points of frequent flyers can be more rewarding with a different airline *within a different alliance* than with the airline they fly most often *within the same alliance*.""

This directly indicates that a different airline **within a different alliance** can offer more points to frequent flyers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mukhtalif ittehad mein eek mukhtalif airline** - While true, the passage emphasizes frequent flyer points, not just any different airline.
*   **B: Usi ittehaad key taht aapki sabsey ziyadah safar ki jaaney waali airline** - The passage specifically says this might *not* be the most rewarding option.
*   **D: Usi ittehaad andar eek mukhtalif airline** - The passage compares airlines *across* different alliances, not within the same one.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail hawaas mein sey kon bahut ziyadah sharaab key istemaal sey maazoor ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Dekhna (Seeing)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sharabi noshi kee kasrat say mumkanah tor purr pesh aaney waali taweel muddati sehat kee kaifiyat mean jigar ko noqsan pahunchna aur yahaan thak kehh **basarat say mahrumi** aur maut shaamil ho sakti hay.""  This translates to ""Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to long-term health issues, including liver damage and even **loss of sight** and death.""

Therefore, sight (seeing) is directly mentioned as a potential casualty of excessive alcohol use. The other options (hearing, tasting, smelling) are not mentioned in the passage as being affected by alcohol abuse."
"Ebarat mein bayan karney key motabiq, sharaab key noqsan dahh asaraat ko maharat key saath kiya cheez kam kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Etedaal key saath sharaab noshi karna (Drinking alcohol in moderation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Alcohal kee mashrubaat motadil tor parr pijiye"" (Drink alcohol in moderation). It then goes on to detail the long-term health consequences of *excessive* drinking.  Therefore, moderation is presented as the key to mitigating the harmful effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sharaab noshi methanol key saath karna (Drinking alcohol with methanol):** The passage specifically warns *against* this, stating methanol is a dangerous contaminant that can cause blindness or death.
*   **B: piney sey mobayyanah tor parr roohein tayyar hoti theen (Having clear spirits prepared beforehand):** This is not mentioned in the text and irrelevant to the discussion of harm reduction.
*   **D: Mukhtalif logon key saath pinaa (Drinking with different people):** The passage does not suggest that drinking with others affects the harm caused by alcohol.



"
Amsterdam ki aala key darmiyaan property ki qadrein kahaan hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Kanaal Zilaa (Canal District)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Amsterdam key binancetod key gard nawah kaa kanal zilaa (ditch: greachtengordale) 17vein sadee kaa mashhur zilaa hay...""  This establishes the Canal District as a prominent area of Amsterdam.
* **The passage also links the Canal District to high value:** ""...Puray zilaa say uss kee munfarid saqafati aur tarikhi ahmiyat key liye eek unisco aalami saqafati warsah site key tor parr namzad kiya jaataa hay, aur uss kee khaasiyat mulk kee aala aqdaar mean say eek hay.""  This means its unique cultural and historical significance, and its nomination as a UNESCO site, contribute to its high value.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: UNESCO ki aalmi warsah site key tor parr tay shudah kisi bhi jagah mein:** While being a UNESCO site *contributes* to value, it doesn't mean *every* place within a UNESCO site is high value. The passage specifically highlights the Canal District.
* **C: Binnenstad sey hataye gaye elaaqey:**  The passage doesn't mention areas removed from the city center.
* **D: Tarikhi aqdaar wali jaghein:**  While historical value is important, the passage points to the *Canal District* specifically as a high-value area.



"
Keon kanal zilaa ko UNESCO key aalami warsah site key tor parr namzad kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Yehh tarikhee aur saqafati qadar hay** (It is historical and cultural value).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...Puray zilaa say uss kee **munfarid saqafati aur tarikhi ahmiyat** key liye eek unisco aalimi saqafati warsah site key tor parr namzad kiya jaataa hay..."" (The entire district is nominated as a UNESCO world cultural heritage site due to its **unique cultural and historical importance**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yehh munfarid khosusiyaat hein** (These are unique features) - While true, it doesn't specifically answer *why* it's a UNESCO nominee.  The *importance* of those features (historical and cultural) is the key.
* **C: Binnenstad key gard nawah ka mahalley waqoo hay** (It is located in the garden neighborhood of Binnenstad) - This is a geographical detail, not the reason for UNESCO consideration.
* **D: Aala khosusiyat ki qasar hay** (It is a palace of high qualities) - This is inaccurate; the passage doesn't mention a palace.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon qabiley qasar Phnom Krom ka daurah karata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap parr nzarah** (A view of Tonle Sap).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mandir kaa udaas maahaul aur tonlay seep jheel kaa balayi nizarah pahadi kee chadhayi ko qaabil deed banata hay."" (The sad atmosphere of the temple and the beautiful view of Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the hill worthwhile).  This directly highlights Tonle Sap as a key attraction when visiting Phnom Krom.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Angkor Pass ka safar karna** (Traveling with an Angkor Pass) - While the passage *mentions* needing an Angkor Pass, it's a requirement for entry, not the main reason to visit.
* **C: Siem Reap dekhna** (Seeing Siem Reap) - Siem Reap isn't specifically mentioned as the reason for visiting Phnom Krom.
* **D: Jheel ka kashti ka safar** (A boat trip on the lake) - The passage says a boat trip *facilitates* the visit, but the view itself is the primary draw.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Phnom Krom mein dakhil honay keliye daurah karney walon ko kiya darkaar hay?","The correct answer is **C: Angkor Pass parr pahunchnaa** (Having an Angkor Pass).

The text explicitly states: ""Mandir mean daakhil honey key liye angcor paas zaruri hay."" which translates to ""An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yasovarman mandir parr chadhna** (Climbing the Yasovarman temple) - The text mentions Yasovarman as the king who built the temple, but doesn't say climbing is required.
* **B: Siem Reap key ird gird safar karna** (Traveling around Siem Reap) - The text focuses specifically on Phnom Krom, not Siem Reap in general.
* **D: Tonle Sap key ird gird kashti ka safar karna** (Taking a boat trip around Tonle Sap) -  The text says a boat trip *makes it easier* to visit, but isn't a requirement for entry.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Antarctica ka daurah karney sey kisi sayyaah ko darjah zail mein sey kon rok sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Bahut ziyadah safar ka bajat (Very high travel budget)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Syahoon key doray mahnge hain"" (Tours are expensive). This directly indicates that the cost of travelling to Antarctica is a significant barrier for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ross Sea ko daryaaft karney ki tanha dilchaspi (Only interest in discovering the Ross Sea):** The passage doesn't mention anything about specific areas of interest preventing travel.
* **C: Kaam ki eek miqaat bandi jiss sey December aur janwari mein safar karney ki ijazat milti hay (A work schedule that allows travel in December and January):** The passage states tours are *only* possible in November-February, but doesn't imply a work schedule is the limiting factor.
* **D: Mahdud jismaani naqlo hamal (Limited physical transport):** While the passage mentions physical fitness is *required*, it doesn't say limited transport *prevents* a tour. It focuses on the need for fitness *to participate* in the tours.



"
Pahaad chadhney mein dilchaspi rakheny wala eek sayyaah Antartica key kiss hissey ka daurah kar sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Jazeerah numaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jismani tandruasti kaa taqazah kartay hain, aur woh sirf november- farvori key mausam garma mean hosaktay hain, aur woh bhee **jazirah numma elaqay**, jazeeray aur raas samundar key elaqay thak mahdud hain.""  ( ...require physical fitness and can only happen in the November-February warm season, and are limited to **peninsular areas**, islands, and coastal regions.)

Since mountain climbing (pahaad chadhney) requires physical fitness and is an activity done on land, the *jazirah numma elaqay* (peninsular areas) are the most likely place a tourist interested in mountain climbing could go in Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ross Sea:**  The Ross Sea is a coastal *sea* area, good for research stations and potentially viewing wildlife, but not for mountain climbing.
*   **B: Zameen key andar ka elaqah (Inner region):** The passage describes the inner region as a barren plateau covered in thick ice – unsuitable for climbing.
*   **D: Jazeerey (Islands):** While islands are mentioned as accessible, they aren't specifically linked to mountain climbing in the text.



"
Tajdid sey pahley ki rasad gaah kam az kam kahaan waqea ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Assani sey qabiley rasayi mahalley waqoo mein (In easily accessible neighborhoods)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inn kee sokoonat aise shehron yaa hozaat mean hay jahaa in thak baasani pahuncha jaa sakta hay"" which translates to ""These are located in cities or areas where they are easily accessible.""  This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kisi shahar key markaz mein (In the center of a city):** The passage implies they are *not* in the modern, bustling centers of cities.
* **C: Kisi door key mahalley waqoo mein (In a distant neighborhood):** The passage emphasizes *easy* access, not distance.
* **D: Kissi college key campus parr (On a college campus):** While the passage mentions ""taleemi maqamat"" (educational institutions), it specifies these observatories are now remnants or curiosities, not actively used places.



"
Jadid tahqiq ka telescope mumkanah tor parr kahaan rakhaa hua hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Eek badi sahulat mein (A big facility)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Door daraaz elaqon mean beshtar jadded tehqiqi doorbeen kee maahaul dost halaat key saath zabardast sahuliyaat mojud hain."" (In remote areas, modern research telescopes have excellent facilities with environmentally friendly conditions).

This directly implies that new telescopes are located in **big facilities** (sahuliyaat) in remote areas, optimized for research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek museum mein (In a museum):** The passage says old observatories are *becoming* like museums, not that new telescopes are *in* museums.
*   **B: Eek university campus parr (On a university campus):** While universities do research, the passage emphasizes remote locations with specific environmental conditions for *new* telescopes.
*   **C: Eek taleemi maqaam mein (In an educational institution):** This is too broad. While related to research, it doesn't specifically pinpoint the type of location described in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek khamush sahiley samudar key dinn key liye konsa elaqah sabsey behtar hay?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baaz auqaat yeah femli shawati bheed bhaad waali hoti hain aur samandar kinaray bary taadad mean dokanein payee jaati hain. yahaan terna mahfuz hay."" (Sometimes these family beaches get crowded and there are many shops on the beach. Swimming is safe here). While this applies to multiple locations, the passage implies St Heliers is a central and accessible option within Auckland.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable for a *quiet* beach day:

*   **B: Mission Bay:** The passage explicitly mentions Mission Bay being alongside Tamaki Drive and being busy.
*   **C: Shumaali Harbor zilaa:** The passage describes it as a long stretch of beach, but doesn't imply quietness.
*   **D: Waitemata Harbor:** This is a general area encompassing several beaches, not a specific quiet location.

Therefore, based on the information provided, **St Heliers** is the most likely answer for a relatively quieter beach experience.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tairaaki ki sharaaet mumkanah tor parr sabsey ziyadah mahfooz kahaan hein?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""woh taqriban saare reteelay saahil hain jo teraki key liye mahfuz hain..."" referring to the northern coast stretching from a long bay to Devonport.  This directly states the beaches in that area are protected for swimming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shumaali Harbor zilaa (Northern Harbour district):** While the northern coast *is within* the Northern Harbour district, the text doesn't say the entire district is protected for swimming, only the coastline stretching to Devonport.
* **C: Markazi Auckland (Central Auckland):**  Saint Heliers is in central Auckland, but the text mentions it's sometimes crowded and doesn't specifically emphasize safety.
* **D: Taweel khaleej (Long Bay):** The text mentions Long Bay as the *start* of the protected coastline, but doesn't focus on its safety specifically.



"
Ebarat mein wazahat kardah mahalley waqoo ka daurah kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kisko namonasib samjha jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mazaaq karnaa (Making fun of)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""holocaust yaa naaziyon kaa mazaaq nah banayein"" (Do not make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis). This directly identifies making fun of the events as inappropriate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adakari ki pokhtagi (Acting respectfully):** The text *encourages* respectful behavior.
* **B: Site key ird gird kisi jagah ki nishandahi ko chod denaa (Leaving a marker at a place around the site):**  The text doesn't mention anything about leaving markers, just about not defacing the site.
* **D: Kisi saakhat ko khurachnaa (Scratching a structure):** While the text does forbid defacing the site (and scratching would fall under that), making fun of the Holocaust is presented as a more serious and direct offense.

Therefore, the passage specifically warns against **making fun of** the Holocaust and Nazism, making it the inappropriate behavior.



"
Inmein sey kon lingua frank zubanon ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Masnooyi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Augzelery zabanein, *masnuyi* yaa tamiri zabanein hain jo logon key darmiyan guftagu ko sahumat deenay key maqsad key saath takhliq kiye gaye hain..."" (Artificial or constructed languages were created with the purpose of facilitating communication between people...)
* **Lingua Franca** are *specifically* constructed or adopted for communication between groups who don't share a native language.  ""Masnooyi"" directly translates to ""artificial"" or ""constructed"", aligning perfectly with the definition of a lingua franca in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gair fitri (Unnatural):** While lingua francas aren't always ""natural"" in the sense of evolving organically, this doesn't define *what they are*.
* **C: Tamiraati (Repairing/Fixing):**  This refers to languages that emerge due to the dominance of other languages. It describes *mixed languages*, not lingua francas themselves.
* **D: Namiyaati (Representative/Typical):** This refers to natural, organically developed languages – the opposite of what a lingua franca usually is.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr moavin zubaano ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Yehh aisi takhliqi zubanein hein jo Mukhtalif zubano key bolney walon key darmiyaan gaalib hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that constructed languages (like Esperanto) are *distinct* from mixed languages that arise when one language dominates communication between speakers of different languages.** Option D describes exactly what constructed languages are *not* - languages that dominate due to other reasons.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A:**  This aligns with the passage’s description of constructed languages being designed for communication.
* **B:** The passage states these languages are both natural *and* constructed.
* **C:** This accurately reflects the purpose of creating these languages – to improve communication in difficult situations.



Therefore, option D is the only one that misrepresents the passage's explanation of constructed languages."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko kiss cheez ki padtaal karni chahiye agar cruise mausam sarmaa mein ho?","The correct answer is **C: Sharaet (Conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""crows key musafiron ko visa key taqazon say istisna haasil hay (sharaet kee padtaal karein)."" This translates to ""passengers on the crows (cruises) have an exemption from visa requirements (check the conditions).""

Therefore, if a traveler is on a cruise in winter, they need to check the *conditions* under which their visa exemption applies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabin ka mahalley waqoo (Cabin location):** The passage doesn't mention anything about cabin locations.
*   **B: Visa ki zaruriyaat (Visa requirements):** While the passage mentions visa exemptions, it specifically says to *check the conditions* of that exemption, not the requirements themselves.
*   **D: Jitnaa waqt shahar mein guzaraa gaya (How much time was spent in the city):**  The time spent in St. Petersburg is mentioned as a pleasant activity, but not as something needing checking.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar mosaafir ka cruise mosame garmaa mein ho, to wohh kiss sey bachney key qabil ho saktey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Baraf mein janaa (Going into the ice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the chilling sound comes from ships passing through the ice in the winter (cold weather).  If the cruise is in the summer, they will avoid traveling through ice, and thus avoid that frightening sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar mein waqt (Time in the city):** The passage mentions spending leisure time in Saint Petersburg, but doesn't connect this to avoiding anything.
* **C: Visa ki zaruriyaat (Visa requirements):**  Crows (cruise passengers) are *exempt* from visa requirements, not avoiding them.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:**  The passage talks *about* Saint Petersburg, but doesn't suggest avoiding it.



"
Catalan ko aksar Barcelona mein alaamaton aur elanaat key liye keon istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yehh Barcelona mein tarjihee zubaan hay (It is the preferred language in Barcelona)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""taqriban nisf log kataalan bolnay ko tarjih deetay hain... Taham ziyadah tar nishanon kee taraf sirf katalani zubaan mean esharah kiya gayaa hay, keunkeh yeah zubaan qanoon key zariah pehli sarkari zubaan key tor parr tasleem kee gayee hay.""  (Approximately half the people prefer to speak Catalan... However, most signs refer only to the Catalan language, because this language has been officially recognised as the first official language by law.)

This clearly indicates Catalan is the *preferred* language and is given prominence due to its official status.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isko haspanavi sey ziyadah wasee paimaney parr samjha jataa hay (It is understood on a wider scale than Spanish):** The passage says *more* people understand Spanish, not Catalan.
*   **B: Yehh shahar ki pahli daftari zubaan thee (It was the city's first official language):** The passage says it's the first official language *now*, not historically.
*   **D: Metro aur deegar awami sahuliyaat ka ziyadah tarr Catalan bolney waaley shahri akasar w beshtar istemaal kartey hein (More Catalan speakers primarily use the metro and other public facilities):** While Catalan speakers might use them, the passage doesn't state this is *why* Catalan is used for announcements and signs.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsi zubaan Barcelona key Metro system key zariyah baqaedah elanaat key liye istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The passage states: ""Metro mean aam ailanat sirf kataalan mean kiye jaatay hain"" which translates to ""Public announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan.""

Therefore, Catalan is the official language used for regular announcements in the Barcelona Metro system. While other languages are used for specific, unplanned announcements, Catalan is the primary language for routine communication.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsi sahuliyat ko mumkanah tor parr aala sirey ka bistar aur nashtah key zariyah tarjeeh nahein dee jaati hay?","The correct answer is **D: Tez WiFi**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *experience* of luxury bed and breakfasts. It highlights:

* **High-quality bedding:** ""nehayat hee purtayyush bistar"" (extremely comfortable bedding) – handmade quilts, rare linens.
* **Local, special breakfasts:** ""elaqay kee mosami soghatein yaa mezban kaa khususi pakwan"" (local seasonal delicacies or the host's special dishes).
* **Atmosphere & Aesthetic:** ""naadir saamaan aaraish, saaf suthray lawn aur swiming pool say mozayyan eek tarikhi puraani emarat"" (a historic building characterized by rare decorations, clean lawns, and a swimming pool).

While these B&Bs are undoubtedly comfortable, the passage *doesn't* mention modern conveniences like fast WiFi. The emphasis is on a more traditional, sensory experience.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned or implied:

* **A: Khosusiyat key menu ki ashyaa (Specialty menu items):**  The passage directly mentions special breakfasts.
* **B: Munfarid qadeem furnishings (Unique antique furnishings):** The passage references ""naadir saamaan aaraish"" (rare decorations) and a ""tarikhi puraani emarat"" (historic building).
* **C: Achchey se sanbhaali gayi bahari khali jagnein (Well-maintained outdoor spaces):** The passage specifically mentions ""saaf suthray lawn"" (clean lawns) and swimming pools.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kon purtayyush B&Bs key darmiyaan moqaabilah key asal point mein sey eek nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Asree sajawat (Contemporary decoration)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that B&Bs primarily compete on **bedding (alaa sirey ki bistar saazi)** and **breakfast (season waley nashtah ki peshkashon ki eek hadd / maqami tor parr zariyah shudah khanaa aur pinaa)**. It also mentions luxurious bedding like handmade quilts and local, seasonal breakfast items or the host's specialty dishes. 

While the passage *describes* B&Bs often being in historic buildings with beautiful grounds and pools, it doesn't say *contemporary decoration* is a key competitive point between them.  The emphasis is on quality of bedding and food, not a particular decorating style.

Therefore, contemporary decoration is the only option that isn't directly mentioned as a primary area of competition."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah mein sey kisko 2022 mein Beijing mein munaqid nahein kiya jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng ki ski elaqah ki waqeaat (Skiing events in the Taizicheng ski area)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that skiing events will be held in *Zhangjiakou's Taizi Ching sky area*, not specifically *Taizicheng*.  While Taizicheng is likely part of that area, the text doesn't mention events being held *in* Taizicheng itself.

The passage explicitly states:

*   **Iftetaahi taqribaat (Opening ceremony)** will be held in Beijing.
*   **Ikhtetaami taqribaat (Closing ceremony)** will be held in Beijing.
*   **Andruni baraf key waaqeaat (Indoor ice events)** will be held in Beijing.
*   **Skiing events** will be held in Zhangjiakou's Taizi Ching sky area.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiss ki 2022 mein Beijing mezbaani karegaa?","The correct answer is **C: Mosame sarmaa ka Olympics (Winter Olympics)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cheen kaa shehar beijing 2022 key olympic **winter games** kee mezbani karnay waala shehar ho gaa..."" (Beijing will be the city to host the 2022 Olympic **Winter Games**...).

While the passage also mentions Beijing hosted both summer and winter games, the question specifically asks what Beijing will host *in 2022*. The answer is the Winter Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mosame garma ka Olympics (Summer Olympics)** - The passage explicitly states Beijing is the *first* city to host *both* summer and winter, but doesn't say it's hosting the Summer Olympics in 2022.
*   **B: Andrune khanaa baraf key waqeaat waqea ho rahey hein (Indoor ice events are taking place)** - This is a *part* of what Beijing is hosting, but not the overarching event.
*   **D: Ikhtetaami taqribaat (Closing ceremony)** - This is also a *part* of the event, not the whole event itself.



"
Kiskey andar avian influenza key moahedah key aala tareen khatraat hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Murgee key kaam** (People who work with chickens).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ziyadah ther logon nay aise afraad ko shaamil kiya hay jo **murghi khaanah mean kaam kartay hain**"" (Most cases have included individuals who **work in chicken farms**). This directly identifies them as a high-risk group.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Prindon parr nazar rakhney waley** (People who watch birds): While bird watchers *could* be exposed, the passage doesn't highlight them as a primary risk group.
*   **B: stan dariyon key saath kaam karney waaley log** (People working with rivers): This is irrelevant to avian influenza.
*   **D: Jo log pahley sey motassir hein** (People who are already infected): This describes individuals *with* the illness, not those at highest risk of *getting* it.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durrust tor parr bard flu ki wazahat kartaa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Parindon ki nigraani karney waley motassir honay key khatrey parr hein (Bird watchers are at risk of being affected)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ziyadah ther logon nay aise afraad ko shaamil kiya hay jo murghi khaanah mean kaam kartay hain, leakin mahireen toyoriyaat ko bhee kuchh khatra lahiq hay."" (More people have included those who work in chicken farms, but bird experts are also at some risk.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sirf murgee key kaam ney flu ka moahidah kiyaa hay (Only chicken farm workers have contracted the flu):** The passage specifically says *both* chicken farm workers *and* bird experts are at risk.
* **B: Parindon key moqabiley insaano mein mazeed cas ki report ki gayi hay (More cases have been reported in humans compared to birds):**  The passage states the opposite – cases in humans are *less than a thousand* while it affects both birds *and* mammals.
* **D: Insaano mein report kiye gaye tamaam cas muhlik ho gaye hein (All reported cases in humans have been fatal):** The passage says *some* cases have been fatal, not all.



"
Safed samundar–Baltic Canal kiss sey rabetah kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic samundar aur Baltic samundar** (Arctic Ocean and Baltic Sea).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Safed samandar - jheel onega, jheel ladoga aur Saint Peter's Burg key zariah, ziyadah ther driyaon aur jhelon key zariah baltak kinaal bahirah arctic ko bahirah baltak say jodti hay"" - which translates to ""The White Sea - through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, and many other rivers and lakes connects the Arctic Sea to the Baltic Sea.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Siyaah samundar aur Caspian samundar** (Black Sea and Caspian Sea) - The text doesn't mention these.
*   **B: Jheel Onega aur dariya Volga** (Lake Onega and Volga River) - While the text mentions these as *part* of the route, they aren't the ultimate connection points.
*   **D: Jonubi samundar aur surkh samundar** (Southern Sea and Red Sea) - The text doesn't mention these.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism ki gaadi parr passport iss trah jamaa nahein kiya jaatey hein jaisey mosaafir ko modakhilat naa karnaa ho?","The correct answer is **B: Raat ki soney waali trainein (Night sleeper trains)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Raat kee sleeper trainon mean, passport conductor jamma lay sakta hay taakeh aap kee neend mean khalal nah paray."" This translates to ""In night sleeper trains, the passport can be collected by the conductor so as not to disturb your sleep.""  This means passports *are* collected on night sleeper trains to avoid interrupting passengers.

The passage implies that on other types of trains, this doesn't happen - the passport is checked while you're awake and need to present it yourself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sayyarey (Planes)** - The passage mentions planes as a starting point for needing identification, but doesn't discuss passport collection during the journey.
*   **C: Jahaaz (Ships)** - Same as planes, it's mentioned as a mode of transport requiring ID, but not passport collection.
*   **D: Sarhad paar ki trainein (Border crossing trains)** - The passage states passports are *checked* on border crossing trains, implying passengers need to have them readily available.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh sarhad paar ki trainon parr aapki ID ki kabb jaanch ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Chalti train parr**.

The passage states: ""Kuchh sarhad paar rail gaadiyon mean chalti train mean muainah kiya jaataa hay aur inn rail gaadiyon mean say kisee parr bhee sawaar honey say pehle aap key paas durust shanakhat honey chahiye."" 

This translates to: ""On some cross-border trains, inspection is carried out on the moving train and before boarding any of these trains you should have valid identification.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Train sey utarney key baad (After getting off the train)** - The passage says immigration check is *usually* the first stop *after* disembarking, but doesn't say ID is checked then on these specific trains.
*   **B: Aap key sonay key waqt (While you are sleeping)** - The passage mentions the passport conductor *collecting* passports while you sleep, not checking ID at that time.
*   **C: Iski jaanch nahein hoti hay (It is not checked)** - The passage explicitly states ID *is* checked on some cross-border trains.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey masalah ko Singapore key ziyadah garam elaqon mein qeaam key waqt bahut mumkanah tor parr uthaana hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Garam thakan jhelnaa (Experiencing heat exhaustion)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions facing ""hiddat (intense heat) and sakht dhoop (harsh sun)"" in the ""oonche elaqon"" (higher areas) of Singapore. This directly relates to the possibility of suffering from heat exhaustion (garam thakan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ghusaa hua honaa (Feeling suffocated):** While humidity *can* be a factor in Singapore, the passage focuses on heat and sun.
*   **B: Dukano tak rasaayi na hona (Not having access to shops):** The passage states you can buy anything after arriving in Singapore, implying easy access to shops.
*   **D: Gumm honaa (Getting lost):** The passage doesn't mention anything about getting lost.



"
Kon Germani pastry khaaney sey bachney key liye chahat rakh sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sakht nut allergy walaa koyi shakhs (Someone with a severe nut allergy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Germani kee bahut see bake kardah ashyaa mean badam, akhrot aur deegar darkhaton key giri daar mewe bhee shaamil hotay hain."" (Many of Germany's baked goods also include almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts).  

Therefore, someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ziyadah umdah sahraon ko tarjeeh deney walaa koyi shakhs (Someone who prefers more exquisite desserts):** The passage *describes* German pastries as rich and varied, not necessarily less exquisite than others.
*   **C: Chocolate napasand karney walaa koyi shakhs (Someone who dislikes chocolate):** The passage mentions coffee pairing well with cakes, but doesn’t imply chocolate is a core ingredient in *all* German pastries.
*   **D: Laziz zayeqon parr meethey zayeqon ko tarjeeh deney walaa koyi shakhs (Someone who prefers savory flavors over sweet flavors):** The passage focuses on the sweetness and fruit content of the pastries, but doesn’t suggest they lack savory elements altogether.



"
Kis juzw ko Germani pastry kaa season walaa unsur samjhaa jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Seb** (Apples).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fruit pastries aam hain, jinn mean tamaam saal pastries mean **seb shaamil kiya jaataa hay**..."" (Fruit pastries are common, and **apples are included** in pastries throughout the year...)

This clearly indicates that apples are considered a seasonal element in German pastry because they are used year-round. The other options (hazelnuts, berries, almonds) are mentioned as ingredients *in* pastries, but aren't specifically identified as a defining seasonal component.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kon eek bajat parr safar karney key liye sifaarish kardah noktah hogaa?","The correct answer is **D: Khaaney aur rehaaesh jaisey ikhrajaat ko kam karnaa (Reduce expenses like food and accommodation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that one way to travel on a budget is to ""try to reduce your expenses."" It then goes on to detail that low-cost travelers are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and the ability to earn money to *minimize* their travel costs.  Reducing expenses like food and accommodation directly aligns with this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apney asfaar key doraan taaq kaamon ko karney keliye talaash karein (Look for odd jobs during your travels):** The passage mentions working *during* travel as a way to fund it, but focuses more on cost reduction.
* **B: Apney aaram ki satah key saath naram rahein (Be flexible with your comfort level):** While sacrificing comfort is mentioned, it's *in service of* reducing costs, not the primary recommendation.
* **C: Logon sey paisa mangein (Ask people for money):** The passage *specifically warns against* begging (""bheek nah maangein"") as an unethical way to travel cheaply.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baut kam bajat parr safar karney mein kiskey paas mushkil waqt rahaa hogaa?","The correct answer is **A: Kisi challenge ka isteqbaal karney walaa koyi shakhs (Someone who accepts a challenge)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that those willing to sacrifice ""comfort, time, and the ability to earn money"" to minimize expenses are those who travel on a very low budget.  Accepting a challenge *implies* a willingness to endure hardship and sacrifice, aligning with the description of low-budget travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sakht waqt ki rokawaton key begair walaa koyi shakhs (Someone without hardship obstacles):** This is the opposite of who would travel on a very low budget.
* **C: Safar key doraan baeed tor parr kaam karney ka mansubah bananey walaa koyi shakhs (Someone planning to work extensively during travel):**  While working during travel *can* help with budget, the passage highlights sacrifice of comfort & time as the defining factor for *very* low budget travel.
* **D: Safar namah ki pairawi sey lutf andoz honey walaa koyi shakhs (Someone enjoying following a travelogue):** This has nothing to do with budget constraints.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Point Marion aur Fairmont key darmiyaan chalaaney ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Door key mulk ki sadak taweel failao hay** (Rural roads are long and winding).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Point Marion our fairmount key darmiyan phailao key sabab bafilo-patsburg highway purr alag thalag androni jungli elaqay key darmiyan say kasrat say guzartay hoay gaadi chalana mushkil bharaa kaam hota hay."" This directly translates to the difficulty of driving due to the winding and remote nature of the road between Point Marion and Fairmont.  ""Taweel failao"" (long and winding) best captures this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Galiyaan tang hein** (The passages are narrow): While the passage mentions ""tang lean"" (tight curves), it doesn't focus on the overall narrowness of the passages themselves.
* **C: Raftaar ki hadd ko shaaz w naadir manaa jataa hay** (Speed limits are rarely observed): The passage actually stresses the *importance* of adhering to the low speed limits.
* **D: Cellphone ki khidmat ko masalah nahein banana chahiye** (Cellphone service shouldn't be a problem): The passage states cellphone service is *good* on this route, not that it should be relied upon.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Buffalo-Pittsburg highway parr safar karney waley driveron key liye inmein sey kon asal tashweesh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Bahut raftaar sey tezi sey murnaa (Sharp, sudden turns at high speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...inn raaston mean oonch neech, tang lean aur **achanak tez mood** ziyadah hotay hain."" (These roads have ups and downs, narrow lanes, and **sudden sharp turns**). It also emphasizes the importance of adhering to the lower speed limits (35-40 mph) because of these conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhaari traffic mein fansna (Getting stuck in heavy traffic):** The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion.
*   **B: kaafi cellular khidmat ki kamee (Lack of sufficient cellular service):** The passage actually says cellular service is *good* on this route, especially compared to other areas like Pennsylvania forests.
*   **D: Aksar sadak key kaam kaa samnaa karnaa (Frequently encountering road work):** The passage does not mention road work.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko khayi khudaayi shuru karney ki darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Thodi miqdaar ki tarbiyat (A little bit of training)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Canyoning mean teraki, chadhayi, aur koodnay key anaasir mujtama hain -- **leakin iss ko shuroo karnay liye nisbatan mamuli training aur jismani shape kee zaroorat hay**...""  This translates to ""Canyoning includes elements of progression, climbing, and jumping -- **but to start it requires relatively little training and physical shape**..."".

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Tairaaki karney ki salahiyat (Ability to swim):** While helpful, the passage doesn't emphasize swimming as a *requirement* to start.
*   **B: Aala jismaani surate haal (Excellent physical condition):** The passage states it requires *relatively little* physical shape, making ""excellent"" condition too strong.
*   **C: Kudney ki salahiyat (Ability to jump):** Jumping is *part* of canyoning, but not the primary skill needed to *begin*.



"
Darjah zial mein sey kon eek kamiyaab khayi khudayi safar key liye zaruri ho saktaa hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Tairaaki ki salahiyat (Swimming ability)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states canyoning involves elements of swimming.** It mentions descending through canyons that *can be full of water*. Therefore, being able to swim is a fundamental requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Aala khelaadi waali salahiyat (High athletic ability):** While helpful, the passage says canyoning requires *relatively* little training compared to activities like rock climbing or alpine shipping. It doesn't demand elite athleticism.
* **B: Scuba gotah khori walaa saabiq tajrabah (Previous scuba diving experience):**  Canyoning isn't scuba diving. While both involve water, the techniques and equipment are different.
* **C: Khayi khudayi key silsiley mein eek tasdiq naamah (A certification in canyoning):** The passage doesn't mention a certification being *required* to start, only that it needs relatively little training.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi key liye apney car mein camp karney ki mansubah bandi key liye kiya madadgaar ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Neechey letney key liye seaton ki ijaazat deney waali eek gaadi** (A car with seats that allow you to lie down).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Car camping Usee soorat mean mumkin hay jab tumhare paas mini vein yaa sport utility vehicle yaa seeden yaa station vegan jis mean aisi seetein hone jinn purr aadmi lait sakay.""  This translates to: ""Car camping is only possible if you have a minivan or sport utility vehicle or sedan or station wagon which has seats that a person can lie down on.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apni gaadi ki hodud mazboot samajh (Strong understanding of your car's limits):** While the passage mentions knowing your car's limits, it doesn't say this *enables* car camping - it just makes the journey safer.
* **C: Eek tent (A tent):** The passage suggests car camping is an alternative *to* traditional camping (and therefore potentially tent use).
* **D: Camp karney key liye niji jaedaad (Private property for camping):**  The passage mentions attracting unwanted attention by camping on private property or in small towns, implying it's not necessary for car camping.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, car camp karney waley agar radaar key taht qeaam karney key liye dekh rahey hein to wohh kiss sey bachna chahtey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Shahar yaa kisi niji jayedaad parr koyi tent set karnaa** (Setting up a tent in a city or on private property).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kisee private property parr yaa jis bhee hajm key town mean khema lagana gair matlub tauajjah ko jalb karnaa hay.""  This translates to: ""Setting up a tent on private property or in any sized town attracts unwanted attention.""

Therefore, car campers, if they are looking to stay *under the radar*, want to avoid drawing that unwanted attention by camping in those places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: SUV yaa minivan jaisi, kisi badi gaadi ko chalanaa** (Driving a large vehicle like an SUV or minivan): The passage actually *suggests* these types of vehicles are *necessary* for car camping, not something to avoid.
* **B: Ziyadah lamba sadak ka safar karnaa** (Taking a very long road trip): The passage celebrates the simplicity and enjoyment of road trips.
* **D: Unki istemaal karney waali gaadi key saath manusiyat ki kami karnaa** (Lacking humanity with the vehicle they are using): This doesn't relate to the idea of staying under the radar.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney Casablanca ko dobarah fir sey tameer kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Marakash ka sultaan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Marakash key sultan nay iss shehar ko daar albadiyah key naam say dobarah tameer kiya..."" (The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Daar Al-Badiyah...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Portugaali:** The text says the Portuguese *destroyed* it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but then *abandoned* it after the earthquake.
*   **B: Hispaanavi taajir:** The Spanish traders later named it Casa Blanca but didn't initially rebuild the city.
*   **C: Merenids:** The Merenids used it as a strategic port long ago, but didn't rebuild it in the context of the question.



"
Casablanca key jadid shahar ko eek qudrati tabaahi key baad kisney khaali kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Portugaali**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Purtagali nay uss ko tabaah karr diyaa aur kaasa branka key naam say usay dobarah tameer karwaya, sirf 1755 key zalzalay key baad usay chhodnay key liye.""  This translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.""

Therefore, the Portuguese abandoned the newly rebuilt city *after* a natural disaster (the earthquake), not *caused* by one. The text doesn't mention Romans, Spanish (Hispanavi), or Phoenicians abandoning the city due to a natural disaster.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bairuni logon key darmiyaan Sintra ney kaisey pahchaan haasil ki thee?","The correct answer is **C: Lord Byron key musbat jayezey (Lord Byron's positive reviews)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""jo lord byron key zariah darj kee gayee apni shaan wo shokat key eek roshan majmuay key baad gair mulkiyon key liye mashhur huwa"" - which translates to ""which, through Lord Byron's registration, became famous for foreigners after a bright collection of glory and sadness.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca:** This is a geographical location mentioned in relation to Sintra's accessibility, not its fame.
*   **B: Marian ki zaaheri shaklein (Marian apparitions):** While the text mentions a famous Marian shrine, it doesn't say this is *how* Sintra initially gained recognition among foreigners.
*   **D: Yehh ishqiyah taarikh hay (This is a romantic history):**  The text hints at a romantic aspect, but doesn't state this *caused* its fame with foreigners.



"
Armenia ney kisko tasleem nahein kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Naya jamhuriyah** (The new republic).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...however, no Muslim country - even Armenia itself - **does not recognize it**.""  ""It"" refers to the new republic formed with Armenian support in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nagorno-Karabakh khittah** - The passage says the *republic* isn't recognized, not the region itself.
*   **B: Azeri logon key khilaaf jang** - The passage mentions the war, but doesn't say Armenia doesn't recognize it.
*   **C: Azerbaijan ki safarati bahsein** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Azerbaijan aur Armenia key darmiyaan talluqaat ko konsi cheez mosalsal motassir karti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Nagorno-Karabakh khittah**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""disputed differences regarding that region [Nagorno-Karabakh] continue to spoil relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""  The entire conflict stems from the dispute over this territory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Azerbaijan mein rahney waley Armeniyayi log** - While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is *part* of the context, it's the *dispute over the land* they live on that's the core issue.
*   **B: 1994 ki jang** - The 1994 war is a *result* of the conflict, not the ongoing cause. The underlying issue of Nagorno-Karabakh still exists.
*   **C: Safarati bahsein** - The passage mentions diplomatic disagreements, but these are *caused by* the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, not the cause itself.



"
Charlotte mein taxi letey waqt konsi cheez ezaafi charge ka sabab ban sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Teen mosaafiron ka haamil honaa** (Having more than three passengers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""2 say ziyadah musafir rakhnay parr jurmanah hay, lehaza yeah intekhaab zaroorat say ziyadah mahnga padsakta hay"" which translates to ""There is a fine for having more than 2 passengers, therefore this option can be more expensive than necessary."" This directly indicates that exceeding the passenger limit will result in an extra charge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kisi deegar elaaqah mein sokunat ikhtiyaar karnaa** (Choosing to live in another area): The passage doesn't mention any extra charges related to location.
*   **C: Shahar tak janaa** (Going to the city): The passage doesn't discuss charges for traveling *to* the city.
*   **D: Khandaan dostanah banana** (Being family-friendly): The passage highlights Charlotte's family-friendliness as a positive, not something that incurs extra costs.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bachchon key saath Charlotte mein rahney key liye kisey kam tarr samjha jataa hay?","The correct answer is **B: taxi lenaa (taking taxis)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aam tor parr sharlet mean taxian istemaal nahein hotein, agarcha kuchh halaat mean istemaal hotein hain. 2 say ziyadah musafir rakhnay parr jurmanah hay, lehaza yeah intekhaab zaroorat say ziyadah mahnga padsakta hay."" (Generally, taxis are not used in Charlotte, although they are used in some cases. There is a fine for carrying more than 2 passengers, so this option can be more expensive than necessary.)

This directly indicates that using taxis is considered less favorable/more expensive when staying in Charlotte, especially with children (implying more passengers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ghar ki qimatein (House prices):** The passage doesn't say house prices are unfavorable. It highlights Charlotte's good options for families.
*   **C: Deegar elaqon key bashindagaan (Residents of other areas):** The passage says people *move* to Charlotte *because* of its family-friendly environment.
*   **D: Shahar sey lutf andoz honay ki koshish karna (Trying to enjoy the city):** The passage says it's easy to imagine enjoying the city *with children*.



"
Haspaniyon ki aamad sey pahley kon Chile key shumaali hissah ko control karta thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""16th century onwards, when Spanish arrived in southern Chile, the *Inca* had a government in northern Chile before the arrival of the Spanish.""

While the Mapuche are also mentioned as a significant indigenous group, they came *after* the Incas in controlling the region prior to Spanish arrival. Araucaniyayi refers to the region, not the rulers, and ""Ameriki log"" is too broad.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, dajah zail mein sey kon 1810 mein kiya waqea hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Chile ney aazadi ka elaan kar diya thaa** (Chile declared its independence).

The text states: ""Agarcha chili nay apni aazadi kaa elaan 1810 mean kiya (nipoliyayi jangon key doraan jab span mean chand salon taak koyee kaarkun markazi hukumat baaqi nahein rahee thee)..."" which translates to ""Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic wars when there was no functioning central government in Spain for several years)...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Markazi hukumat ki gair mojudgi thee** (There was no central government) - While true *during* that time, the text says this *happened* when Chile declared independence, not that it *was* the event of 1810.
* **B: Chile ney span parr fatah haasil ki thee** (Chile conquered Spain) - The text specifically says the final victory over Spain wasn't achieved until 1818.
* **C: Napoleon ki jangein ladi jaa rahi theen** (Napoleonic wars were being fought) - Again, this is a circumstance *of* the event, not the event itself.



"
Log Liguria key khittah mein door draaz key gaon tak kaisey pahunch saktey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Train yaa kashti key zariyah** (Train or by boat).

Here's why:

The text states: ""guzar gaahein, trainein, aur kashtiyan nawazaat ko jodti hain aur baahir say kaarein inn thak pahunch nahein saktein.""  This translates to ""paths, trains, and boats connect the villages and cars from outside cannot reach them.""

Therefore, the only ways to reach the villages are by train or boat.



"
Itli ki istelaah ‘Cinque Terre’ ka matlab kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanch gaon** (Five villages).

The passage explicitly states: ""Sink teeray, jaiska matlab paanch zaminein hain...paanch chhote saheli gaon parr mushtamil hay"" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means five lands...comprising five small coastal villages.""

Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" means five villages."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism ki kashti mumkanah tor parr fislan waley mosamey sarmaa ki surate haal keliye mauzoon hay?","The correct answer is **A: Tang heels waali kashtiyaan (Low heels)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Heals ko nichla aur chodaa honaa chahiye."" which translates to ""Heels should be low and broad.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Juday huey saazo saamn waali kashtiyaan (Separate soles and uppers)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the construction of the shoe, only the heel and sole.
* **C: Oonchey heels waali kashtiyaan (High heels)** - The passage directly contradicts this, saying heels should be *low*.
* **D: 1/5 inchi gahrey namooney key bagair kashtiyaan (Shoes without a 1/5 inch deep tread)** - The passage states the tread should be *at least* 5mm (1/5 inch) deep.



"
Inmein sey kon Mosame sarmaa key halaat key doraan baraf ki sadkon parr krishn ko behtar bananey mein madad nahein karegaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Paani (Water)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that sand, gravel, or salt (calcium chloride) are *scattered on roads and walkways to improve traction*.  Water, however, is the *cause* of slippery conditions (ice and slush) and therefore would *not* improve traction. It's the problem the other materials are trying to solve.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Namak (Salt)** - The passage states salt (calcium chloride) *is* used to improve traction.
*   **B: Bajri (Gravel)** - The passage states gravel *is* used to improve traction.
*   **C: Rayt (Sand)** - The passage states sand *is* used to improve traction.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Hawaii aur Cook jazeeron key darmiyaan durust momasil hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh eek hi waqt key mintaqah ka ishteraak kartey hein** (They share the same time zone).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hawai kee hee tarah eek hee time zone waale yeah jazeeray kabhi kabhaar """"hawai down under"""" tasavvur kiya jaataa hay."" (Like Hawaii, these islands which have the same time zone are sometimes imagined as ""Hawaii down under"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unn dono mein bahut sey badey hotel hein** (They both have many large hotels) - The passage says Cook Islands lacks the large hotels Hawaii has.
* **B: Unn dono key paas riyaasat ka darjah nahein hay** (They both don't have state status) - This isn't directly mentioned in the text. The passage focuses on the *political standing* of Cook Islands relative to Hawaii.
* **D: Unn donno mein koyi shahar nahein hein** (Neither of them has cities) -  The passage specifically states Cook Islands doesn't have cities (""Cock jazair mean koyee shehar nahein hay""). However, it doesn't state this is *also* true for Hawaii.  The question asks for a similarity.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr Cook jazeeron ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Asal shahar Rarotonga aur Aitutaki hein** (The main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""inn mean ahem rartonga aur aayito taaki hain"" which translates to ""among them, Rarotonga and Aitutaki are important."" This directly identifies them as key locations within the Cook Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yehh Hawaii sey chotta hay** (It is smaller than Hawaii) - While the passage *mentions* it's smaller than Hawaii, it's not a defining characteristic presented as a key detail.
* **B: Yehh eek jazeerah numa hay** (It is an island) - The passage states it's a *group* of 15 islands (""15 mukhtalif jazeeron kaa majmuah""), not a single island.
* **D: Jazeerah walaa mulk Hawaii ki tarah eek hi waqt key mintaqah ka ishteraak karta hay** (The island nation shares the same time zone as Hawaii) - The passage says it's *often considered* ""Hawaii down under"" *because* it has the same time zone, but doesn't state this as a primary characteristic or defining feature.



"
Darjah zail ranger station mein sey kon do qism key rehaaeshi ikhteyaraat ki peshkash karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Serena is a single ranger station that offers both camping *and* shared dormitory rooms for overnight stays...""

The other options are described as offering only camping:

*   **Los Patos** and **San Pedrillo** offer camping ""without food service.""
*   The passage doesn't mention **La Leona** at all.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, credit key bajaye raqam istemaal karney keliye agar aap chahtey they to park ki ijazat ko aap kahaan mahfooz kar saktey they?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pewarto jamineez mean ranger station say baraah raast park permits haasil karnaa mumkin hay, magar woh credit cards qabool nahein kartay"" which translates to ""Park permits can be obtained from the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards.""

This directly answers the question – if you want to use cash instead of credit, you need to go to Puerto Jiménez to get your park permit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirena:** Sirena is mentioned as offering lodging and camping, but doesn't specify anything about accepting only cash.
*   **C: CafeNet El Sol:** This is mentioned as a place for booking, but doesn't relate to getting permits with cash.
*   **D: La Leona:** This isn’t mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism ki skiing ko ziyadah steep khittah mein kiya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Alpine andaaz (Alpine style)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*aakhir alzikar ko dhalwan khittay mean kiya jaataa hay aur iss mean ziyadah sakht aiski aur jootay kee zaroorat parti hay.*"" (…ultimately it is done in steep areas and requires more difficult skis and boots).  It then clarifies that this is *not* typical ""alpayan style"" (Alpine style) touring or mountaineering. This implies the steep area skiing *is* the more difficult, specialized kind, which aligns with the description of needing tougher equipment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski ka paidal safar (Ski touring)** - The passage specifically contrasts this type of skiing *with* the steep area skiing.
*   **B: Mulk ki himayat yaaftah skiing (Back country skiing)** - The passage *defines* this type of skiing at the beginning, but it isn’t specifically tied to steep terrain in the way the question asks.
*   **D: Ski key zariyah Backpacking (Ski key zariyah Backpacking)** - This isn’t discussed in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mulk key himayat yaaftah ski karney walon ki kia cheez madad kar sakti hay jo mazeed ziyadah raftaaron tak pahunchna chahtey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Achchey halaat (Good conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Achhi haalat mean aap chehal qadmi key bajaye kisee bhee tarah ziyadah doori tay karr payein gay"" which translates to ""In good conditions, you can cover much more distance than 40 steps.""  This directly links good conditions to achieving greater speed/distance in backcountry skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sakht jootey (Sturdy boots):** While sturdy boots *are* necessary for backcountry skiing, the passage says they are a *requirement* of the activity, not something that helps you go *faster*.
* **B: Eek bhaari package (A heavy package):** A heavy package would likely *hinder* speed and distance, not help it.
* **D: Tayyar track (Prepared track):** The passage specifically contrasts backcountry skiing with skiing on prepared tracks, stating you can't achieve the same speed on prepared tracks.



"
Dobarah dakhil honey waley sadmah ka samnaa karney waley musaafiron key paas kiya krney key liye sakht waqt hota hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Apni ghareloo saqafat sey az sirey naw mowafiqat karnaa (Readjusting to one's home culture from scratch)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that returning travelers often find it *difficult to re-adopt their own culture* after easily adapting to a new one. They feel detached from their home culture and accustomed to the foreign one.  This means they have to essentially learn to live in their own culture *again*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nayi jagah ki saqafat sey mowafiqat karna (Adapting to a new culture):** This describes the *initial* stage of culture shock, not the re-entry shock being discussed.
* **B: Saabir aur samajhdaar rahnaa (Being patient and understanding):** While patience and understanding are helpful, the passage says *others* need to be patient with returning travelers, not the travelers themselves needing to *do* this.
* **C: Bairune mulk safar karnaa (Traveling abroad):** This is the cause of the problem, not what the travelers need to *do* to cope with the re-entry shock.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, dobarah dakhil honay walaa sadmah khaas tor parr kis qism key mosaafir key liye mushkil ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Bairune mulk rahney key waqt fauri tor parr motabiqat karney waley mosaafir hazraat (Travelers who quickly adapt when living abroad)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""woh sayyaah jinhein nayey tehzeeb wo tamaddun akhtiyar karnaa waqat key lehaaz say aasaan rehaa ho kabhi kabhaar unhein apni tehzeeb ko dobarah akhtiyar karnaa mushkil hojata hay.""  This translates to: ""Those travelers for whom it was easy to adopt a new culture and civilization sometimes find it difficult to re-adopt their own culture.""

The passage highlights that *ease* of adaptation to a new culture can ironically make *re-adaptation* to one's home culture difficult.  This directly corresponds to option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions ""tehzeebi sadmah"" (cultural shock) generally, but doesn't specifically say it's *bad* cultural shock that makes re-entry hard. It's the *easy* adaptation, not necessarily a traumatic one.
*   **C:** ""Suhaag raat key marhalah"" (honeymoon phase) is used metaphorically to describe the initial positive feelings, and the passage says this phase is *shortened* with re-entry shock, not that it's the type of traveler experiencing it.
*   **D:** While patience and understanding are mentioned as being *needed* by others, the passage doesn’t say that *less patient* travelers have more difficulty. It focuses on the traveler’s adaptation *speed*.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiya kaam logon ko moose key saath karney sey bachna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **D: Unkaa door sey moshahedah karnaa (Observe them from a distance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people who don't see moose as dangerous get too close and put themselves at risk.  This implies the best course of action is to *keep your distance* and observe them safely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apni mojudagi ko nazar andaaz karnaa (Ignoring your presence)** - This is dangerous!  You need to be *aware* of a moose, not pretend it's not there.
* **B: Bahut aahistah pahunch haasil karnaa (Slowly approaching)** - The passage warns against getting close at all. Slow doesn't make it safe.
* **C: Apney mumkanah khatrah ki satah ko kam karnaa (Reducing your potential threat level)** - While good advice generally, the passage specifically says the problem is getting too close, not *how* you present yourself.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, moose key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Wohh fitri tor parr jaarehanah janwar hotey hein (They are naturally aggressive animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mus (jinhein ailak bhee kahaa jaataa hay) woh zaati tor parr jarhana fitrat nahein rakhtay"" which translates to ""Moose (also called elk) do *not* have a naturally aggressive nature.""  

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Unhein baaz auqaat mumkanah khatrah nahein samjha jataa hay (They are sometimes not considered a possible threat)** - This is directly stated: ""Jo log ameriki mous ko khatarnaak nahein samajhte"" (Those who do not consider American moose dangerous...).
* **C: Qreebi qurbat key andar key logon ney unhein motaharrik kiya jaa saka (People within close proximity have provoked them)** -  The passage implies this by saying people get too close and put themselves at risk.
* **D: Agar zaruri hua to wohh khud difaa karein gay (If necessary, they will defend themselves)** - This is also directly stated: ""magar woh apna defaa zaroor karein gay agar unhein eek khatray kaa ehsaas ho"" (but they will certainly defend themselves if they sense a threat).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon eek sahrayi mosaafir key liye kam az kam khatarnaak hoga?","The correct answer is **A: Eek thandi raat ko garam kapday ki kami (Lack of warm clothes on a cold night)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even the hottest deserts can become extremely cold at night and that without warm clothes, *hypothermia is a real danger*.  This is presented as a direct and immediate threat.

Let's look at why the other options are less immediately dangerous *compared to hypothermia*:

*   **B: Paani ka dhokah denay waley saraab ko dekhanaa (Seeing a deceptive mirage of water):** While a mirage is a problem, simply *seeing* it isn’t immediately life-threatening.
*   **C: Saraab ka taaqub kartey waqt taqat zayah karnaa (Wasting energy chasing a mirage):**  Wasting energy is bad, but not as acutely dangerous as freezing.
*   **D: Saraab ka taaqub kartey waqt paani zayah karnaa (Wasting water chasing a mirage):** Wasting water is serious in the desert, but the passage emphasizes the *immediate* risk of hypothermia on cold nights.

Therefore, the most immediate and potentially fatal danger listed in the passage is a cold night without warm clothes.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko sahrayi mosaafiron key liye eek mumkanah khatrah key tor parr zikr kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Saraab**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Dinn kee garmi mean, musafiron ko nazar kaa dhoka hosakta hay jo paani (yaa doosri cheezon) kaa bharm deta hay. Agar musafir saraab kaa peecha karay to yeah khatarnaak hosaktay hain..."" This directly identifies *saraab* (mirage) as a danger to desert travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

*   **A: Paani ki kami (Lack of water)** - While implied as a consequence of chasing a mirage, it's not directly mentioned as an initial threat.
*   **C: Hypothermia** - The passage mentions hypothermia, but as a danger of *cold* nights, not as an initial threat faced during the day.
*   **D: Suraj ki sozish (Sunburn)** - The passage doesn't specifically mention sunburn, although the heat is discussed.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, daryaaft kunindagan ki aamad key baad kis jamaat ki aabadi ziyadah motassir hui thee?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Europe kaa khoj karnay waalon kee aamad key chand saal baad say hee hispanvi fateheen kee taraf say taayi nose kee aabadi mean waazeh tor parr kamee waaqa ho gayee thee"" (Shortly after the arrival of European explorers, the population of the Taíno clearly decreased due to the Spanish conquerors).  It further details that Spanish conquerors killed approximately 100,000 Taíno people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haisiyon:** This group isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Caribian:** While the passage mentions Caribs as early inhabitants, it focuses on the *decline* of the Taíno population after European arrival.
*   **D: Hispanavi:** This refers to the Spanish (the conquerors), not a group whose population decreased.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Caribian log konsi zubaan boltey they?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""carebase arawakin zubaan bolnay waale log they jo kehh 10,000 bce key qareeb yahaan aayey they."" (The Caribbean people spoke the Arawakan language who came here around 10,000 BCE.)
"
Dobarah takhliqi sargarmi key tor parr skiing ko mashhoor karney ka credit kis ko diya ja sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Norwey key log** (Norwegian people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1861 mean pehla tafrihi sky club norway key baashindon nay australia mean khola thaa."" (In 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by the residents of Norway). This indicates that the Norwegians were instrumental in popularizing skiing as a recreational activity, establishing the first club dedicated to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski pithein** (Ski paintings) - The passage mentions ancient ski paintings, but these show the *history* of skiing, not its re-popularization as a recreational activity.
*   **C: Gaar mein rahney waley log** (Cave dwellers) - The ancient paintings are connected to cave dwellers, but again, this is about the origins, not the recreational revival.
*   **D: Australia key log** (Australian people) - Australians *hosted* the first recreational ski club, but they weren't the ones who initiated or popularized the activity. It was the Norwegians who brought it to Australia in that form.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss waqt key ird gird khel key tor parr skiing ko sabsey pahley taslim kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: 17vein sadi (17th century)**.

The text states: ""Down hill skiig khel kaa rewaj kam wo baish 17vein sadee mean shuroo huwa..."" which translates to ""The tradition of downhill skiing began around the 17th century...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 18vein sadi (18th century):** The text specifically mentions the 17th century.
* **B: 5000 BC:** This refers to the earliest *depictions* of skiing, not when it was practiced as a sport.
* **C: 1861:** This is when the first recreational ski club was opened, not when skiing was first adopted as a sport.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon aam tor parr mashriqi afriqi saahil key sabsey baday jazeerey key saath wabastah hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Jangali zindagi (Wildlife)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Madagaskar intehayi badaa hay, aur jab baat jungli hayat kee aatee hay to woh bazaat khud eek barre aazam hay."" (Madagascar is extremely large, and when it comes to wildlife, it is truly magnificent).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Europe ke logon ka asro rosukh (European influence):** While European influence is mentioned in the passage, it's not specifically tied to the *largest* island.
*   **B: Islami khittah (Islamic region):** The passage mentions the introduction of Islam to the Comoros and Mayotte, but doesn't connect it specifically to the largest island, Madagascar.
*   **D: Pur tayyush resort (Luxury resorts):** The passage mentions smaller islands being known for luxury resorts, not the largest one.



"
Ziyadah chotey mashariqi afriqi jazeeron ki kiya khosusiyat nahein hay? ,"The correct answer is **B: Bahut sey pur tayyush resort (Many luxurious resorts)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peshtar chhote jazair azad mulk hain yaa france say waabistah hain aur inn ko lagzari beach resorts key unwaan say jaana jaataa hay.""  This translates to: ""Previously, smaller islands were independent countries or associated with France, and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: France sey rabetah (Association with France):** While some are associated with France, the text doesn't highlight this as a *defining* characteristic of *all* the smaller islands.
* **C: Jangli zindagi ki shohrat (Fame for wildlife):** The text specifically says Madagascar is famous for its wildlife, not the smaller islands.
* **D: Deegar mamalik sey aazadi (Independence from other countries):** The text states some are independent, but others are *associated* with France, meaning not all are free.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh khaas tor sey rewayati churchon ki jaanib sey Easter kaisey manaya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sanichar ki eek raat ki nigraani ki mezbaani karnaa** (Hosting a vigil on Saturday night).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aksar taqlidi church easter kee taateel mean shanbah kee raat shab bedari kartay hain, aadhi raat hotay yee tamaam ibadat guzaar maseeh key dobarah zindah honey kaa jashan manatay hain.""  This translates to: ""Often traditional churches hold a vigil on Saturday night during the Easter holiday, and at midnight they celebrate the resurrection of Christ through worship.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek zarkhezi ki rewayat ka haamil honaa** (Being a bearer of a fertility tradition) - The passage *suggests* a possible pre-Christian origin, but doesn't state churches *practice* this.
* **C: Jamaat key liye eek bahaar party karnaa** (Hosting a spring party for the congregation) -  The text focuses on worship, not a party.
* **D: Toluey aaftab dekhnaa** (Watching the sunrise) - While the passage mentions watching the sunrise as part of an older custom, it doesn't say churches specifically do this as part of their Easter celebration.



"
"Makhsus zaruriyaat sey bachney key liye Ecuador mein dakhil hotay waqt, Cuba key eek shahari ko sabsey pahley kiya haasil karnaa zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek qanooni dawat namah ka khat (A legal invitation letter)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ekwador chahta hay kehh cuba key baashinde ekwador mean daakhil honey say qabal bain alaqwami airports yaa sarhadi daakhli maqamat key zariye eek **dawat namah vasool karein**."" (Ecuador wants Cuban residents to obtain a **letter of invitation** before entering Ecuador through international airports or border entry points).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek passport safar ki tarikhon key baad 6 mahiney ba jawaaz rahta hay (A passport valid for 6 months after the travel dates):** While a valid passport *is* required, the passage highlights the invitation letter as the *first* thing needed.
*   **C: Qeaam ki lambayi ko sabit karney keliye do tarfah safar ka ticket (A roundtrip ticket to prove length of stay):** This is a requirement *in addition to* the invitation letter, not the first step.
*   **D: Ameriki sabz card (American green card):** The passage mentions green card holders can *apply for an exemption* but don't automatically have access; they still need to contact the Ecuadorian consulate.



"
Ecuador key safar ki zaruriyaat kia hein jiskey liye usey design kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek monazzam muntaqili key bahao ko bahaal karnaa** (To restore organized migration flows).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the requirements are ""waza kee gayee hain taakeh donon mulkon key maabain mohajireen kee aamad wo raft ko monazzam kiya jaa sakay"" - meaning they are designed to organize the flow of migrants between the two countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kam az kam key liye mosaafiron ki tadaad ko barqaraar rakhnaa** (To maintain a minimum number of travelers) - The text doesn't mention a minimum number of travelers, only organization.
*   **C: Kisi mosaafir key taharney ki tewaalat ki tasdiq karnaa** (To confirm a traveler's duration of stay) - While proof of onward travel *is* required, the primary goal isn't simply confirming the length of stay, but controlling migration.
*   **D: Passport key jawaz ki yaqeen dahani karnaa** (To ensure passport validity) - Passport validity is *a part* of the requirements, but not the overarching reason for them. The goal is broader than just checking passports.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon watan key moqabiley mein kisi doosrey mulk mein ziyadah qimati ho sakti hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Aala asal key framez** (High-quality original frames).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text states: ""Iss tarah key elaqon mean dastiyaab aala brand key naam key fremon mean do dushwari hosakti hay kuchh dastak band ho saktay hain, aur asl daraamadaat baraamadaat karnay waali jagah say ziyadah mahngi hosakti hain.""  This translates to: ""In areas, available high brand name frames may be difficult to find, some may be closed, and can be more expensive than the original importing place.""

This directly indicates that high-quality, branded frames can be *more expensive* in foreign countries, especially those with lower labor costs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aankh ki janchein** (Eye tests) - The text suggests eye tests might be *cheaper* abroad, especially if insurance covers them.
*   **C: Nazar ki yaqeen dahani** (Contact lenses) - The text doesn't mention contact lenses at all.
*   **D: Gair brand naam waley frame** (Non-brand name frames) - The text implies these might be cheaper due to lower labor costs in other countries.



"
Kisi khariji mulk mein aala asla key framez khareedney kaa kiya mumkanah khatrah bann sakta hay?,"The most likely risk of buying high-end frames in a foreign country, based on the provided text, is **C: Wohh naqli ho saktey hein (They might be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions difficulty in availability of established brands (""dastiyaab aala brand key naam key fremon mean do dushwari hosakti hay"")** and suggests they might be more expensive than the original source (""asl daraamadaat baraamadaat karnay waali jagah say ziyadah mahngi hosakti hain""). This strongly implies the risk of encountering fakes.
* The text also hints at price discrepancies due to labor costs.  Counterfeit goods often exploit price differences.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely *based on the provided text*:

* **A: Eek ezaafi aankh ki jaanch darkaar ho sakti hay (An extra eye exam might be needed):** The text *suggests* getting an eye exam at home before buying, but doesn't state a *need* for an extra one due to buying abroad.
* **B: Makhsus framez key liye tashkhees ho sakta hay jayez na ho (A diagnosis might not be valid for specific frames):** The text doesn't mention anything about diagnoses and frame compatibility.
* **D: Yaqeen dahaani ho sakta hay qimat ka ehaatah na kar sakey (Confidence might not be able to cover the price):** While price is mentioned, the core concern seems to be authenticity, not just affordability.



Therefore, **C** is the most reasonable answer given the information in the passage.



"
Falklands mein currency key istemaal key baaey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah dururst nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Stanley tanha eek aisi jagah hay, jahaan ameriki dollar qobool kiye jaatey hein**.

Here's why:

The text states that American dollars are *often* accepted, not that Stanley is the *only* place they are accepted.  It doesn't limit acceptance to just Stanley.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

* **A: Sir credi card aur bartanawi pound ko bahari jazeeron parr qobool kiya jaata hay:** The text confirms British pounds are generally accepted on outer islands and credit cards *can* be accepted.
* **C: Jazeerey chodney sey pahley Falkland key pound ka tabadalah honaa chahiye:** The text explicitly states it's almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, so exchange them before leaving.
* **D: Falkland pound sey qata nazar, bartanavi pound aam tor parr ziyadah maqbool currency hay:** The text says British pounds are commonly called for and accepted on credit cards, implying they are more widely accepted than Falkland pounds.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, America sey Falklands mein safar kartey waqt, kahaan credit car ki ba nisbat adayegi ki deegar shakal khaas tor parr mofeed ho sakti hay?","Correct answer is **C: Bairuni jazeeron mein**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Baheri jazeeron key credit card ghaliban tasleem nahein kiye jayein gay, halankeh bartaniah, europe aur ameriki currency lie jasakti hay..."" This means that on the outer islands, credit cards are *not* usually accepted, but other currencies (like American dollars) *are* more likely to be. Therefore, carrying cash (like US dollars) would be particularly useful when traveling to the outer islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: FIC key magribi store mein:** The text mentions the exchange bank is *near* the FIC West store, but doesn't suggest it's the best place to use alternative payment methods.
*   **B: Tamaam jazeeron mein:**  This is incorrect because the text says credit cards are generally accepted in the ""jazair"" (presumably meaning towns/Stanley)
*   **D: Stanley mein:** The text mentions British Pounds and Steenlay credit cards are accepted in Stanley.



"
Konsa waqea mandir key teohaaron key jashan key saath wabasta nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek haathi ki paidaesh (The birth of an elephant)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals often celebrate:

*   The temple's anniversary.
*   The birthday of the presiding deity.
*   Other significant events associated with the temple.
*   It also mentions decorated elephant processions as *part* of the festivals, but not the *reason* for them.

The birth of an elephant is not mentioned as a reason for celebration in the passage. It is an element *within* some celebrations, but not a core reason for the festival itself.

Therefore, option A is the event not directly associated with temple festival celebrations according to the text."
Mozayyan haathiyon ko kahaan dekhaa ja sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandir key tehwaron key jolus mein (In the processions of temple festivals)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Keral key dilchasp mandiron key melay dekhnay key laiq hain, iss mean **sajaye hoay haathiyon kaa joloos nikala jaataa hay**...""  This directly translates to ""The interesting fairs of Kerala's temples are worth seeing, in which **decorated elephant processions are taken out**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: November key ikhtetaam sey mayi key wast tak kahein bhee (Anywhere from the end of November to May)** - The passage states the festivals *happen* during this time, but doesn't say elephants are everywhere during those months.
*   **B: Mandiron mein (In temples)** - While elephants are *associated* with temples, the passage highlights them in the *processions*.
*   **D: Kerla ki sadkon parr (On the streets of Kerala)** - While processions are on the streets, the key detail is they are *part of the temple festivals*.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon karobaar yaa pahely darjah key hawyi keraye parr paisah mahfooz karney key kaa sabsey ziyada mumkanah tariqah hay?","The correct answer is **A: Apni company mein isko kharch karnaa (Have your company pay for it)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yeah khulaa rasta yeah hay kehh iss imtiyaz key liye zarr key eek motee gaddi nikal phainko (yaa **behatar hoga kehh aap apni company key zariah iss kee adayegi karayein**).""  ( ""...the open path to this privilege is to dig into your hefty savings (or **it's better to have your company pay for it**)."")

The passage explicitly suggests having your company cover the cost as a way to afford business or first class. The other options are not supported by the text:

* **B: Karobaar key bajaye pahley darjah ki booking karna (Book first class instead of business)** - The passage states first class is *much* more expensive (11x economy).
* **C: Eek bilwastah pahley darjah ki parwaaz book karnaa (Book a direct first class flight)** - The passage indicates direct flights are not cheaper.
* **D: Koyi reaayat talaash karnaa (Look for discounts)** - The passage doesn't mention discounts as a viable strategy.



"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, makhsus keraye ke darjon ko book karnay key waqt ko talaash krney key liye ziaaye waqt kiaa hogaa?","The correct answer is **C: Reaayatein (Discounts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Aam baat karein to karobar yaa eek jagah say doosri jagah keliye braah raast parwazon key frist cliss keliye chhoot parr ghor karnay kee bhee wajah nahein hay.""  This translates to ""Generally speaking, there's no reason to even look for discounts on first class for direct flights for business or travel from one place to another."" 

The question asks what you *won't* find when looking for special fares - and the passage explicitly says you *won't* find discounts on first class direct flights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Braahe raast parwazein (Direct Flights):** The passage *mentions* direct flights, but doesn’t say you won't find fares for them. It says you won't find *discounts* on them.
*   **B: Karobaari darjah (Business Class):** You *can* find fares for business class; the passage explains how much more expensive they are.
*   **D: Pahla darjah (First Class):** You *can* find fares for first class; the passage explains how much more expensive they are.

Duniya bharr key kerayah key saath Africa kull kerayah key iqtebaas ka mowazenah kartey waqt kiss cheez ko shaamil karney zarurat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Africa mein rawangi key taxon ki qimat**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states to include ""izaafi wezay, rawangi mahsulaat, zamini naql wo hamal waghairah key izaafi ikhrajat"" (additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, and handling charges) *when comparing African travel costs to global travel costs*.  

Therefore, departure taxes *within* Africa are already part of the baseline African travel cost and don't need to be *added* when making the comparison.  The comparison focuses on the *additional* costs of reaching destinations *outside* of Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Africa sey bahar key maqamat key liye ezaafi vison ki qimat (The price of additional visas for destinations outside of Africa):** The passage explicitly says to include extra visa costs for non-African locations.
* **C: Africa key visa ki qimat (The price of African visas):**  The passage implies you need to account for visa costs relevant to the *overall* journey, which would include any African visas needed.
* **D: Africa key baahar mahallate waqoo key liye zaminee transportation ki qimat (The price of ground transportation for locations outside of Africa):**  The passage explicitly states to include ground transportation costs for non-African locations.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, supermarket kiss cheez key mazeed motanawwah intekhaab ki peshkash shuru kar rahey hein?","The correct answer is **A: Tayyar khana (Ready-made food)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Taksiri andaaz mean super markets tayaar shudah khaaney key bahut see qasmein farokhat kartay hain"" which translates to ""Supermarkets offer a wide variety of ready-made food.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Microwave choolhey (Microwave ovens):** The passage mentions supermarkets *providing facilities to heat food* (like microwaves), not selling the ovens themselves.
*   **C: Site parr resturaan (On-site restaurants):** While the passage mentions some supermarkets having restaurants, it says this is in *some countries or certain types of stores* – it’s not a general offering of supermarkets.
*   **D: Sasti qeematein (Cheap prices):** The passage mentions restaurants being ""sastaa"" (cheap), but doesn't say supermarkets generally offer cheap prices - just a wider selection of ready-made food.



"
Baaz supermarket ki jaanib sey faraham kardah konsi sahulat saarif ko tayyaar khana kharidney key liye ubhaarti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Eek microvave choolha** (A microwave oven).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...super markets tayaar shudah khaaney key bahut see qasmein farokhat kartay hain- yahaan thak kehh khaana garam karnay keliye kuchh to micro view aween yaa deegar wasail bhee farahim kartay hain.""  This directly translates to ""supermarkets offer many types of ready-made food - even providing microwaves or other means to heat the food.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Site parr resturaan (Restaurant on site):** While the passage *mentions* restaurants within or near some supermarkets, it doesn't present this as a facility *provided by* the supermarket to encourage buying ready-made food.
*   **B: kam motanawwah intekhaab (Limited selection):** The passage says supermarkets offer *many* types of ready-made food, the opposite of a limited selection.
*   **C: Kachcha khana (Raw food):** The passage focuses on *ready-made* food, not raw ingredients.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsi baat fransisi bolney waley belgium aur swiss key logon ki jaanib sey ho sakta hay kehh nahh samjha gaya ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Meaari fransisi number walaa system (Standard French number system)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Belgian and Swiss French speakers learn *standard* French in school to ensure they can be understood. It also highlights differences in pronunciation and some vocabulary.  However, it doesn't mention any misunderstanding regarding the *number system* in standard French. The passage focuses on regional variations *within* the French language, not issues with fundamental aspects like numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ajeeb fransisi alfaaz (Strange French words):** The passage mentions ""addi nizam chand mamuli khususiyat"" and different vocabulary, suggesting unfamiliar words could be a source of misunderstanding.
*   **C: Fransisi alfaaz key khaas talaffuzaat (Specific pronunciations of French words):**  The passage directly states that pronunciation differs.
*   **D: France mein ziyadah tarr fransisi bolney waley (More French speakers in France):** This is irrelevant to the question of what Belgians and Swiss might *not* understand.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon france mein usy tarah nahein hay jaisaa kehh wohh belgium aur Switzerland mein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tamaam alfaaz ka talaffuz (The pronunciation of all words)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*baaz alfaz kaa talaffuz bhee mukhtalif hay* (the pronunciation of some words is also different).""  This means pronunciation *differs* in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Number walaa system (Number system):** The passage doesn't mention anything about different number systems.
* **C: Skulon mein padhayi janey wali meyaari fransisi zubaan (Standard French taught in schools):** The passage states that all French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland *learn* standard French in school, implying it *is* taught and understood, just like in France.
* **D: Kuchh fransisi alfaaz ki hijjey (Some French words):** While the passage mentions differences, it says they are slight enough for mutual understanding, and doesn't claim entire words are missing or different – just pronunciations and some minor peculiarities.



"
Kiss manzar namah mein aap ko mumkanah tor parr sog key kerayah ki peshkash nahein ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Agar aap Lufthansa ko paris sey America tak udaa rahey hein.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Lufthansa only offers bereavement fares for flights *originating* from the US and Canada. It doesn't mention any bereavement fares for flights originating from Paris to America.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar aap magribi tayyarah udaa rahe hein** (If you are flying westward) - The direction of travel isn't mentioned as a limiting factor in the passage.
* **B: Agar aap freeqe saalis ki khidmat key bajaye airline sey brahe raast book karney ki koshish kartey hein** (If you try to book directly with the airline instead of through a travel agent) - The passage states you *must* book directly with the airline.
* **D: Agar aap Delta ko udaa rahey hein** (If you are flying Delta) - Delta *does* offer bereavement fares, according to the passage.



"
Sog key kerayon key barah mein kiya durust hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Unhein lazmi tor parr baraahe raast phone key zariyah airline sey book karnaa hogaa.**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Tamaam muamilon mean, aap co laazman air line say phone key zariah braah raast book karwana chahiye.""  (In all cases, you must book directly with the airline by phone.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh janaazah key safar ki qimat ka ihaatah kartey hein** (They cover the cost of funeral travel) - While the travel is *for* a funeral, the text doesn't say they *cover* the cost, just offer discounted fares.
*   **B: Unhein baraahe raast airline ki website parr book karnaa zaruri hay** (They must be booked directly on the airline's website) - The text says the opposite; they must be booked *by phone*.
*   **C: Wohh aakhiri minute key safar ki qimat ka ihaatah kartey hein** (They cover the cost of last-minute travel) -  They offer discounts *on* last-minute travel, they don't ""cover"" the cost.



"
Standalone GPS aalah ka istemaal kabb GPS gashti app sey ziyadah aasan hogaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Jabb aap hadd sey bahar ja rahey hon (When you are going out of range)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a GPS navigation app's functionality is *limited or unavailable* when you don't have a data connection or are out of cellular range. A standalone GPS device doesn't rely on a data connection, so it would be more useful in those situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jabb aap paisa bachaney ki koshish kar rahey hein (When you are trying to save money):** The passage states the app *saves* you money compared to buying a device or renting a car, so this is the opposite.
*   **B: Jabb aap ko yaqeen ho kehh aap key paas data connection hogaa (When you are sure you will have a data connection):** The app works best *with* a data connection, but a standalone GPS isn't dependent on it.
*   **D: Jabb aap kisi aalah ko kerayah parr lenaa chahtey hon (When you want to rent a device):** The app saves you from *renting* a car, so this is incorrect.



"
GPS gashti app istemaal karney key liye konsi achchi wajah nahein hay is tor parr kehh wo standalone aalah key khilaaf ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Data connection key baarey mein parishaan honey ki zarurat na honaa**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that the functionality of GPS navigation apps is limited or unavailable when you *don't* have a data connection or are out of communication range.  This means relying on the app *requires* worrying about data connection – it's a drawback, not a benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Paisa bachanaa (Saving money):** The passage says GPS apps *save* money by avoiding the cost of new maps or a dedicated GPS device.
* **C: Kerayon sey bachna (Avoiding rentals):** The passage mentions saving money by not needing to rent a car.
* **D: Naye naqshon ko kharidney ki zarurat na honaa (Not needing to buy new maps):**  The passage highlights this as a cost saving benefit of using the app.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aap kaisey yehh garanty dey saktey hein kehh aap monasib jahaaz key moshabah hein?","The correct answer is **C: Galapagos key safar mein takhsis haasil karney waley kisi agent key saath book karna** (Booking with an agent specialized in Galapagos travel).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""**Aap yaqeen karein kehh jis agent say aap book karwatay hain woh goalpagoz kaa maher hay jis key paas bahut qism key jehaazon kee achhi malumat hay.** Yeah iss baat co yaqeeni banaye gaa kehh aapki khususi dilchaspiyan aur / yaa rukawatein unn keliye sab say mozoon jehaaz key saath mel khaa gayee hain."" (Make sure the agent you book with is a Galapagos expert who has good information about many types of ships. This will ensure that your specific interests and/or limitations are matched with the most suitable ship.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Momasil dilchaspiyon waley 8+ mosaafiron ki jamaat mein book karnaa** (Booking in a group of 8+ travelers with similar interests) - The text doesn't mention this as a way to *guarantee* a suitable ship.
*   **B: Kam season key doraan book karnaa** (Booking during the low season) -  This is suggested for availability (ships get full during peak season), but doesn’t guarantee the *right* ship for *you*.
*   **D: Bahut peshgi book karnaa** (Booking far in advance) - Similar to the low season, this helps with availability but doesn't guarantee the *best* fit.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon mehmaano key juwaa khelney ko barqaraar rakhney key harbah key tor parr istemaal nahein hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Qudrati roshni ki kasrat** (Abundance of natural light).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states casinos *avoid* windows (and thus natural light) to make it harder for guests to leave and to maintain a specific atmosphere. It *does* mention:

*   **B: Concert key muft ticket jaisee muraat** (Free concert tickets like incentives) - as special offers for entertainment.
*   **C: Taarifi mashrubaat** (Complimentary drinks) - as a way to keep guests in good spirits and staying at the location.
*   **D: Ghadiyon ki gair mojudgi** (Absence of clocks) - as a tactic to disorient guests and make them lose track of time.

Therefore, abundance of natural light is the one thing the passage states casinos *don't* use to encourage gambling.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez sey eek maahir juwari ko bachna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Bahut ziyadah sharaab pinaa (Drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""taham, sharab noshi faislah saazi co kharab karti hay aur tamaam achhay joey baaz hosh mean rehney kee ahmiyat co jaantay hain"" which translates to ""however, drinking alcohol spoils decision-making and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober."" 

The passage warns that excessive alcohol consumption impairs judgment, which is crucial for a skilled gambler to avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Koyi muraat qobool karnaa (Accepting a bribe)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about bribes.
* **C: Divaar yaa haath ki ghadiyaan istemaal karnaa (Using wall or hand watches)** - The passage notes the lack of clocks, but doesn't suggest avoiding them if they were present.
* **D: Qareeb tareen khoruj key baarey mein tafteesh karnaa (Investigating the nearest exit)** - While casinos make it difficult to leave, the passage doesn't suggest a skilled gambler should avoid knowing the exit.  It implies the difficulty is *because* they're kept in a desirable state.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kalaam ka konsa hissa jumlah key darmiyaan bada horoof hota hay?","The correct answer is **B: Asmaa (Nouns)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aap key liye lafz saiye key saath tamaam **asmaa**, hamishah kisee capital haraf say shuroo hoti hain yahaan thak kehh kisee jumley key vast mean bhee.""  This directly translates to ""For you, all **nouns** with the definite article 'the', always start with a capital letter here, even within a sentence.""

The passage is describing a rule where nouns are capitalized.  The other options – verbs (afaal), adjectives (sifaat), and auxiliary verbs (muavine afaal) – are not mentioned as being capitalized in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez asmaa key bady horoof honey ko ziyadah mushkil bana sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Likhna (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...halankeh tehriri tor parr yeah bahut mushkil hay kehh yeah malum kiya jaa sakay kehh kisee fel yaa sifat co bunyadi shakal mean istemaal kiya jaataa hay yaa nahein."" 

This translates to: ""...however, in writing it is very difficult to know whether a verb or adjective is used in its basic form or not.""

This directly implies that *writing* is what makes determining whether a word is a proper noun (and therefore capitalized) more difficult.  While reading *can* be challenging, the passage specifically highlights the difficulty *in writing*.



"
Malaysia key dehee hisson mein kis isharay ka matlab “Aaiye” hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Haath hilanaa**.

The passage states: ""Leakin maleshiya, yaa cum az cum dehati malayayiyon key darmiyan, iss key maanee """"aa jaiye"""" key hain."" which translates to ""But in Malaysia, or among some rural Malaysians, it means 'come here'.""  And it specifically refers to the gesture of waving/hand shaking (""haath hilla kirr"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Esharah ki unglee ko mornaa** (Flicking the index finger) - The passage mentions this gesture but associates it with a different meaning (similar to showing the middle finger in Western cultures).
* **C: Aala paanch karna** (High five) -  The passage doesn’t mention this gesture.
* **D: Angutha dikhana** (Showing the thumb) - The passage doesn't mention this gesture.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss esharey ka matlab “wapas aaiye” ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Hatheli andar ki taraf dikha kar esharah karna** (Showing a palm facing inwards).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*maleshiya, yaa cum az cum dehati malayayiyon key darmiyan, iss key maanee """"aa jaiye"""" key hain.*"" (…in Malaysia, or among some rural Malay people, it means ""come back"").  It then explains this is done by gesturing with the palm facing inwards, similar to how the index finger is used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esharah ki unglee ko mornaa (Bending the pointing finger):** The passage doesn’t mention this gesture.
* **C: Hatheli bahar ki taraf dikha kar esharah karnaa (Showing a palm facing outwards):** The passage specifically warns *against* this gesture in Spain, as it can be mistaken for saying goodbye.
* **D: Sar hilanaa (Nodding the head):** This is a general gesture for agreement or acknowledgement, not specifically mentioned in the context of ""come back.""



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, shagafon ki kiya wajah ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Girtey baraf key gaar (Falling ice caves)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Barf key ghaaron kee chhatein our dewarein girsakti hain aur daraaden band ho sakti hain."" This directly translates to ""The roofs and walls of ice caves can collapse and canyons can be blocked."" This means the collapse of ice caves *causes* the shagaaf (canyons/ravines).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baraf key pul (Ice bridges):**  While glaciers have ice, the passage doesn't mention ice bridges causing shagaaf.
*   **B: Gair mustahkam glacier (Unstable glacier):** The passage describes *effects* of glacial movement (like blocks breaking off) but doesn't directly state an unstable glacier is the cause of the shagaaf.
*   **D: Dheeley block (Loose blocks):** While loose blocks fall from glaciers, the passage specifically links the *collapse of ice caves* to the formation/blocking of shagaaf.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inn mein sey kisko baraf key pul key zariyah chupaya ja sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Daradein (Ravines)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Barf key ghaaron kee chhatein our dewarein girsakti hain aur **daraaden band ho sakti hain**.""  This directly translates to ""The roofs and walls of ice caves can collapse and **ravines can be blocked**."" This means ravines can be covered/hidden by ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Baraf key gaar (Ice caves):** The passage says these *collapse*, they aren't covered up.
*   **C: Deewarein (Walls):**  Similarly, the walls of ice caves *collapse*.
*   **D: Baday block (Large blocks):** These *fall* and *break off*, but aren't hidden *by* ice.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kiss mahalle waqoo ka daurah karney sey pahley mosaafiron ko ezaafi ehteyaat karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Nyiragongo aatish fashaan (Nyragongo volcano)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the area *outside* Goma, towards the North Kivu province, has ongoing conflict. It also mentions Goma serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, but implies that traveling *to* and *around* the volcano requires investigation due to the conflict. Therefore, extra caution is needed before visiting the volcano area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Goma key gardo nawah key elaqey (Goma's surrounding areas):** While the text notes conflict *outside* Goma, it doesn't specifically highlight extra precautions for the surrounding areas of the city itself.
* **C: Shahar ka markaz (City Center):**  The text states Goma is ""reasonably safe"" which indicates less need for extra caution *within* the city center.
* **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as being near Goma, but the text doesn’t say anything about needing extra precautions when going to Rwanda.



"
Darjah zail mein kon Goma mein kisi sayyah keliye achcha noktah nahein ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Shumaali Kivu ki ladayiaan tafreeh faraham kar rahi hein** (The fighting in North Kivu is providing entertainment).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that outside of Goma, there is ongoing conflict in North Kivu province and that *investigation is needed to understand the situation*.  It doesn't suggest this conflict is something a tourist should seek out or find enjoyable. In fact, it implies the opposite - it’s a safety concern.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* the correct answer:

*   **B:** The passage says Goma is a base for tracking mountain gorillas.
*   **C:** The passage mentions 'boda boda' (motorcycle taxis) as a means of getting around.
*   **D:** The passage states Goma is a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.



"
Agast mein ibtedayi dinn key liye mulk ki himayat yaaftah ijazat kabb dastiyaab hogi?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 Janury**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iss tor mayee mean ibtada kee kisee bhee tareekh key liye beak contry permit 1 januri say mohayya hogi."" (In this way, permits for any starting date will be available from 1 January).

Therefore, regardless of when you plan to start your hike (even in August), the permit becomes available on January 1st of that year.



"
Wadi ka tahaffuz karney key liye konsi policy jagah parr hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ejazaton ki eek mahdood tadaad** (A limited number of permits).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Permits kee eek mahdud taadad walk inn darkhwaston key liye reserve hay..."" (A limited number of permits are reserved for walk-in requests). This directly indicates a policy of limited permits for the protection of the canyon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek pahley aao, pahlaa mahfooz ijazat ka system** (First come, first served permit system) - This is *part* of the system for walk-in permits, but it's not the overarching policy for *conservation*.
* **B: Ijazatein sirf 1 januri ko dastiyab hein** (Permits are only available on January 1st) - The passage states permits become available *up to* four months in advance, with a starting point of January 1st for initial dates, not that they are *only* available then.
* **C: Ijazatein sirf darkhawast lekar jaaney key zariyah haadil kiya ja sakta hay** (Permits can only be obtained by submitting a request) - While applying is necessary, it doesn't explain the conservation policy.  The limitation on *how many* permits are given is the key element related to conservation.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon kam az kam mumkanah tor parr ebarat mein bayan kardah hotlon ki qism mein paaya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek cocktail bar**.

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels with a history of luxury, frequented by the wealthy and famous, with a vibrant nightlife.  A cocktail bar would be a *very* common and expected feature in such hotels, especially those from the ""Golden Age"" described. It fits the description of ""umdah khaaney khaatay aur raat kee zindagi guzartay they"" (ate fine food and spent the nightlife).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Eek site parr petoo resturaan (A casual on-site restaurant):** The passage emphasizes *luxury* and ""umdah khaaney"" (fine dining), making a casual restaurant less likely to be highlighted.
* **C: Aisey saathi mehmaan jo qabiley shanakhat key liye mashhoor hein (Famous companions):** While the passage mentions famous people staying at these hotels, it doesn't focus on them *bringing* companions. It's about the hotels attracting them directly.
* **D: Jadid aala darjah waley tajdid shudah haaliyah kamrey (Modern high-end renovated living rooms):** The passage notes a *blend* of old-world charm and modern amenities, but also mentions ""kuchh khaas shandar pairanah kee kamee bhee unkay kirdaar key hisssay hain"" (a lack of some especially grand features are also part of their character), suggesting they aren't always completely modern and renovated.



"
"Ebarat mein pesh kardah malumaat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail pesh kashon mein sey kisko hotel key mehmaan kam az kam mumkanah tor parr tarjeeh dengey?","The correct answer is **B: Eek mumataaz bawarche walaa returaan (A superb chef restaurant)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that these hotels are known for being places where ""mashur zamana aur ameer log rukaa kartay they, aur aksar umdah khaaney khaatay aur raat kee zindagi guzartay they"" (famous eras and wealthy people used to stay, and often ate fine food and enjoyed nightlife). This directly emphasizes the importance of *high-quality dining* to the typical guest of these hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Puri jayedaad mein qadeem furnishings (Antique furnishings throughout the property):** While the hotels have ""qadeem tarz kee lawazmaat"" (antique-style decor), the passage doesn't suggest this is the *primary* draw for guests. It's part of the character, but not the main selling point.
*   **C: Eek raat ki tafreeh pesh karney walaa lounge (A lounge offering nightly entertainment):**  Nightlife is mentioned, but as *one* aspect of the experience, not necessarily a defining feature that guests will prioritize.
*   **D: Sastey kamron ki qimatein (Inexpensive room rates):** The passage describes guests with ""bahut ziyadah raqam"" (a lot of money). These are luxury hotels catering to the wealthy, so price is unlikely to be a primary concern for their target clientele.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Mosaafiron key Greenland ka daurah karney sey kis cheez sey bacha ja sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah jarayem ki sharah key liye mashhoor makhsus elaqey** (Areas known for high crime rates).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aam tor parr green land mean gher mulkiyon key saath, jurm, aur gher munsifana rawayyah, amli tor parr namalum hay. Thanda mausam shayed woh waahid haqeeqi khatra hay jis kaa saamna ghairtiyar fard co karnaa paray gaa. Thaka kehh qasbon mean bhee, koyee """"bray elaqay"""" nahein hain."" 

This translates to: ""Generally, crime and unfair treatment towards foreigners are practically unknown in Greenland. The cold weather is perhaps the only real danger a visitor will face. Even in settlements, there are no """"bad areas.""""

Therefore, the passage indicates that visitors *don't* need to worry about areas known for high crime rates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage explicitly states you need *warm* clothes because it's cold, not hot.
* **C:** While the passage mentions potential internet issues, it doesn't say you need to avoid expecting to work.
* **D:** The passage advises *against* using the term ""Eskimo"" as it's considered offensive.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Greenland ka daurah karney waley gair tayyar mosaafiron key liye ziyadah mumkanah tor parr masalah walaa hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mosam (Weather)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""**Thanda mausam shayed woh waahid haqeeqi khatra hay jis kaa saamna ghairtiyar fard co karnaa paray gaa.**"" (Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger a non-local will face.)  It further elaborates on needing warm clothes in winter and potential health issues from long summer days.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Nordic machchar (Mosquitoes):** The text mentions mosquitoes, but says they *don't* carry disease, only cause annoyance.
* **B: Jurm (Crime):** The text states crime is ""practically unknown,"" even in settlements.
* **D: Maqami log (Local people):** The text advises avoiding certain language when speaking to locals, but doesn't indicate they pose a danger to travelers.



Therefore, the text clearly identifies the weather as the most significant potential problem for unprepared travelers."
Markazi plaza key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kisko abb istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Jamaat**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yeah abb markazi plaza key toor purr com karta hay..."" which translates to ""It now serves as the central plaza.""  And the beginning of the passage identifies the place as ""Jarden day law union"" (likely a mis-transcription of *Jardín de la Jamaa* or *Jardín de la Plaza* – a garden/plaza).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kiss ka rastah (Callejon del Beso)** -  The text specifically describes *Callejon del Beso* as a narrow alley with a love story, *not* the central plaza.
* **C: Templo de San Diego** - The text says this is a remaining building *similar in style* to the original structure, but not what the central plaza is *now* used for.
* **D: Callejon del Beso** - As explained above, this is an alley, not the plaza.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Jardín de la Jamaat mein nahein payaa jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek purani convent ki emaarat (An old convent building)**.

Here's why:

The text states the space *was* made on the site of a 17th-century convent atrium, but it now functions as a central plaza. It doesn't say the original convent building *still exists* there. It was transformed.

Let's look at why the other options are present:

*   **A: Mahafile mosiqui walaa markazi gazebo (Central gazebo with musical performances):** The text specifically mentions free concerts are frequently presented from the central gazebo.
*   **B: Purani ishqiyah kahaani kaa ghar (Home of an old love story):** ""Callejon del beso"" is described as the home of a love story.
*   **C: Baagh ka samnaa karta resturaan (Restaurant facing the garden):** The text says ""several restaurants are around the garden.""

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, dinn key paidal safar key baarey mein darjah zail mein sey konsa bayaniyah na durust samjha jayegaa?","The correct answer is **D: Dinn ka paidal safar bachchon waley khandaano key liye eek monasib bahari sargarmi nahein hay** (A day hike is not a suitable outdoor activity for families with children).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chhote bachon waale ahal khaanah cow ziyadah tayariyon kee zaroorat padsakti hay, leakin bachon our pre-school key bachon key saath bhee eek rozah out doors aasani say mumkin hay."" (Families with small children may need more preparation, but a day outdoors with children and pre-school children is easily possible).

This directly contradicts option D.  The passage supports the idea that day hikes *are* a suitable activity for families with children, albeit potentially requiring more preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Aasaan pagdandiyon parr dinn key asfaar keliye thodi tayyari ki zarurat hay** (A little preparation is needed for day trips on easy trails) - The passage mentions ""thodi see tayariyon kee zaroorat hay"" (a little preparation is needed).
*   **B: Fasley motanawwaa hotey hein, lekin unkaa matlab hota hay kehh eek dinn ki muddat mein unkaa ehaatah kiya jaye** (Distances vary, but the intention is to cover them in a single day) - The passage describes hikes as covering ""cum fasilay say lay kirr ziyadah lambay fasilay"" (distances ranging from moderate to long) which can be completed ""ju eek dunn mean tay kiya jaa sakay"" (which can be covered in a day).
*   **C: Motadil satah ki fitness waley log aam tor parr iss sargarmi ka lutf uthaaney key qabil hongey** (People with a moderate level of fitness will generally be able to enjoy this activity) - The passage states ""koyee mutadil toor purr sehat mand insaan inn say lataf andoz hosakta hay"" (any moderately healthy person can enjoy these)."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek din key paidal safar ko bahut kam tayyari ki kabb zarurat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Jabb paidal safar karney walaa jismani tor parr fit ho (When the hiker is physically fit)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...our koyee mutadil toor purr sehat mand insaan inn say lataf andoz hosakta hay."" This translates to ""...and a moderately healthy person can enjoy these.""  This directly implies that a physically fit person needs very little preparation for a day hike.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jabb ismein ziyadah aasan pagdandi shaamil ho (When it includes a very easy trail):** While an easy trail helps, the passage doesn't say it *reduces* preparation.
* **C: Jabb bachchey paidal safar parr jaa rahey hon (When children are going on the hike):** The passage specifically says families with young children *need more* preparation.
* **D: Jabb paidal safar eek mazeed qudrati mahaul mein ho (When the hike is in a more natural environment):** The environment doesn't affect the amount of preparation needed, only the enjoyment.



"
Norway key baaqi ki banisbat Rogaland yaa Agder key plateau key baarey mein mukhtalif kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Unkaa aksar heather mein ehaatah hota hay** (They are often surrounded by heather).

Here's why:

The passage states that in Rogaland and Agder, these plateaus (""hayee"") are described as treeless moorlands ""often seen from a distance"".  Heather is a common plant found in moorlands. The passage contrasts this with the general Norwegian landscape of deep places and valleys.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unmein darakht hein** (They have trees) - The passage specifically states these areas are *treeless*.
* **B: Koyi fjords nahein hein** (There are no fjords) - The passage doesn't mention fjords.
* **C: Plateau ziyadah tar taaq hotey hein** (The plateaus are more powerful) - The passage does not discuss the *power* or strength of the plateaus. It focuses on their appearance and vegetation.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Norway keliye aam nahein hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Jangalaati plateau**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Norway is characterized by:

*   Deep places and valleys that suddenly rise into high, elevated surfaces.
*   Plateaus (""wadday"") which are *wide, open spaces without trees*.
*   ""Hayee"" in Rogaland and Agder, meaning treeless moorlands.
*   Fjords are implied by the description of deep places and valleys rising into heights.

Therefore, a *forested* plateau (Jangalaati plateau) contradicts the description of Norwegian plateaus as being treeless and open.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Zameen ki khuli tausee (Open land expanse):** The description of ""wadday"" and ""hayee"" points to large open spaces.
*   **C: Khadee fjords (Steep fjords):** The passage mentions deep places and valleys rising to high surfaces, which is characteristic of fjords.
*   **D: Moorlands:**  Specifically mentioned as ""hayee"" in certain regions of Norway.



"
Skiing mein dilchaspi rakhaney waaley sayyaon ko pahadi station kaa daurah kabb karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Mosame sarmaa key doraan (During the winter season)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""bahot say hill steshon mean achhi barf baari hoti hay our vahan skiing our snowboarding kee sargarmiyan arooj purr hoti hain"" (in many hill stations there is good snowfall and the activities of skiing and snowboarding reach their peak) during the winter season ( *mosame sarmaa*). 

Therefore, someone interested in skiing should visit during winter.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aam tor parr kabb ziyaadah tarr sayyah pahadi station parr hotey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Hindustani mosame garma key doraan** (During the Indian summer).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hill stations purr seyahat kaa mausam aam toor purr hindustani mausam garma mean arooj purr hota hay."" This directly translates to ""Hill station travel is most popular during the Indian summer.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhaari baraf baari key jhamelon key doraan** (During the commotion of heavy snowfall) - The passage mentions snowfall is beautiful in winter, but doesn't say it's *when* travel is most popular.
*   **B: Purey snowboarding season key doraan** (During the entire snowboarding season) - Snowboarding is mentioned as an activity *during* winter, but not as the peak travel time.
*   **D: Purey mosamey sarmaa key mahinon mein** (During the entire winter months) - While winter has its own beauty, the passage specifically highlights summer as the busiest season.



"
agar aap madad ki talaash karney waali kashti milney ki tawaqqo karr rahey hein to aap ko kiya karney sey bachna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **D: Saathi kashti ka safar karney walon ko nazar andaaz karnaa (Ignoring fellow ship travelers)**.

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states: ""**Jahaan thak mumkin how ziyadah say ziyadah logon say baat karnay kee koshish karein**"" - ""Try to talk to as many people as possible.""  Ignoring fellow travelers would be the opposite of what you should do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dock sey ooper aur neechey chalnaa (Walking up and down the dock)** - The passage doesn't mention avoiding this; it focuses on communication.
*   **B: Kaptanon ka dost banana (Making friends with captains)** -  While not directly stated, building rapport with those in charge is implied by seeking information.
*   **C: Apni khidmaat ka ishtehaar karnaa (Advertising your services)** - The passage directly mentions announcing your availability for assistance (""aap elaan lagayein gay"").



"
Madad ki darkaar kisi kashti ko talaash kartey waqt aap ko marinas key gardo nawah mein kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Jahaaz raano key saath rabetah karein (Contact the ship captains)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically mentions: ""...*baar mean jehaaz raanon say raabtah karnay kee koshish karnay waghairah*..."" which translates to ""...try to contact the ship captains, etc..."".  This directly relates to what you should do in a marina while searching for a distressed vessel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: radar key taht qaem rahein (Stay under the radar):** The passage emphasizes *actively* seeking information, not hiding.
* **C: Logon key apney yaat ko saaf karney key waqt sirf unn tak pahunchney ki koshish karein (Only try to reach people while they are cleaning their boats):**  The passage says to reach *as many people as possible*, not just those cleaning boats.
* **D: Saathi safar karney walon sey bachein (Avoid fellow travelers):** The passage encourages speaking to *everyone* to gather information.



"
Jazeerah key samraaji taarikh mien dilchaspi rakhney waley kisi sayyah keliye konsa mahalle waqoo dilchasp hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Shumaali saahil (Northern shore)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah woh jagah hay jasay bartanvi samrajiyon nay apna banaa lia thaa our asee tarah agar aap elaqah key nawabadiyati maazi kaa sobut talaash kirr rahay hain, too iss kee sharoaat karnay key liye yeah eek achhi jagah hay.""  (This is the place the British empires made their own, and if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.) This directly refers to the **Shumaali saahil (Northern shore)** as the area where the British established themselves and where remnants of that colonial history can be found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kowloon waterfront:** While a significant area, the passage doesn't specifically link it to the colonial past.
*   **C: Hong Kong ka nichlaa shahar (Hong Kong's lower city):** The passage doesn't mention this area in relation to colonial history.
*   **D: Victoria Harbor:** Victoria Harbor is a landmark, but the passage focuses on the *land* around it where the colonial history is found.



"
Shaandar manazir ko tarjeeh deney waley kisi sayyah key liye konsa mahalle waqoo dilchasp hogaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hong Kong ka behtareen nazarah karnay key liye jazirah co chhodo our iss key bilmaqabil colon water front purr jaao."" (To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite colonial waterfront.) 

The Kowloon waterfront is described as offering a stunning view of the city's skyline, especially with the lights reflected in Victoria Harbour. The passage emphasizes it as *the* place to go for the best views.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Victoria Harbor:** While beautiful, the passage suggests going *to* the waterfront to *see* Victoria Harbor, not that the harbor itself is a neighborhood to explore.
*   **B: Hong Kong kaa munaasib:** This option doesn't exist in the text.
*   **C: Hong Kong jazeerah:** The passage explicitly says to *leave* the island to get the best views."
Rukaab mein fansey ksisi sawaar key pair key khatrey ko kam karney mein madad karney walee kuch zeenon mein kiya hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Hifaazati salaakhein (Safety bars)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""baaz zeenon bilkhusus english zeenon mean seifty baar lagi hoti hay jasay agar garnay waala sawaar peeche say kheenche to rakaab kaa chamda zeen say alga hokar gurr jaataa hay."" This translates to ""some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars fitted so that if the rider is pulled back, the stirrup leather detaches from the saddle and falls away.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tang talvey (Tight ankles):** While the passage mentions tight-fitting boots, this isn't a feature *of the saddle* itself, but of the rider's attire.
*   **C: Chamdey ki rukabein (Leather stirrups):** The passage discusses the *detaching* of stirrup leather, not the stirrups themselves being made of leather.
*   **D: Azeem tarr istehkaam (Greater stability):** While stirrups *provide* stability, this isn't a safety feature designed to prevent a rider's foot from getting stuck.



"
Sawaar honey waley jutah ki konsi khosusiyat sawaar ki hifaazat ko rukaab istemaal kartey waqt badhaney mein madad karti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek khurdura, tang talva** (A rough, tight sole).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that good riding boots should have a ""lambi eedhi how, hamwaar how, kaafi tang how our tanha how"" which translates to ""long heel, smooth, quite tight and single"".  ""Tang"" means tight, and the passage implies a textured/rough sole helps prevent slipping within the stirrup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chamdaa (Leather):** While stirrups and often boots *are* made of leather, the passage doesn't say leather specifically improves safety within the stirrup.
* **C: Eek aedi (A heel):** The passage mentions a long heel, but the safety benefit isn't simply *having* a heel, but the heel's specific characteristics.
* **D: Eek chodaa talva (A studded sole):**  The passage mentions a *smooth* sole, not a studded one.



"
Mehmaan nawazi tabadlah ke network key zariyah mosaafiron ko kiya pesh kash ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Maqami mezbaano key saath rehaeshein** (Accommodation with local hosts).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the hospitality exchange network connects travelers with locals offering accommodation (""*musafiron co inn shehron key mahli baashindon say marbut kurti hay jinn kee woh seyahat karnay jaa rahay hain*"").  The whole premise of the network, as exemplified by the founding story of Couchsurfing, is finding free or low-cost lodging with local people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sasti parwazein** (Cheap flights) - While the founder *found* a cheap flight, the network itself doesn't *offer* cheap flights. It focuses on lodging.
* **C: Maqami rahnumaon key zariyah karaye gaye daurey** (Tours arranged by local guides) - The passage doesn't mention guided tours.
* **D: Eek hi manzil ka daurah karney waley deegar mosaafiron key saath raabtey** (Connections with other travelers visiting the same destination) -  While reviews from other travelers are mentioned, the primary offering isn't connecting travelers *to each other*, but to *hosts*.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, mehmaan nawazi key tabaadlah network key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahee nahi hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mosaafiron ko hamesha maqami mezbaano key hawaley faraham kiye jaatey hein (Travelers are always provided with references to local hosts)**.

Here's why:

The text states that a *list* of available hosts is provided, *and sometimes includes references/reviews from other travelers*.  It doesn't say that references are *always* provided. It's possible a host doesn't *have* references yet.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Kuch network mein mosaafiron ki ezaafi tasdeeq darkaar hoti hay (Some networks require additional verification of travelers)** - The text mentions ""kachh neat works izaafi tausiq kee paishkash kartay yaa chahte hain"" (some networks offer or require additional verification).
*   **C: Mosaafiron ko manzil shahar mein dastiyaab mehmaan nawazon ki eek fihrist faraham ki jaye gee (Travelers will be provided with a list of available hosts in the destination city)** - This is directly stated: ""dastiyaab mezbanon kee eek fehrist print shakal mean our / yaa aan line farahim kee jaati hay"" (a list of available hosts is provided in print or online format).
*   **D: Baaz auqaat mosaafiron key liye maqami mehmaan nawazon key jayezey dastiyaab hotey hein (Reviews of local hosts are sometimes available to travelers)** - The text states ""baaz auqaat dosray musafiron key hawalay our tajziye darj hotay hain"" (sometimes references and reviews from other travelers are included).

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism ka mehmaan kam az kam mumkanah tor parr kisi hotel key mushtarekha kamrah mein paya jata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Unkey shuruaati bees ka eek mehmaan** (A guest in their early twenties).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hostels bilkhusus naujawanon - bees salah umar waale khaas mahmanon kee mezbani kartay hain..."" (Hostels especially cater to young people - guests in their early twenties...). This indicates that guests in their early twenties are the *most common* type of guest found in hostels, and therefore the most likely to be found in a shared room.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Akelaa safar karney walaa eek mehmaan** (A solo traveler) - While hostels *do* get solo travelers, the passage doesn't highlight them as the primary demographic.
* **C: Chotey bachchon key saath safar karney walaa eek mehmaan** (A guest traveling with young children) - The passage specifically says families with children are *rare* in hostels.
* **D: Unkey darkiyaani tees kaa eek mehmaan** (A guest in their late thirties) - The passage focuses on young people in their early twenties.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, hastal mein kiskey thaharney ka bahut ziyadah imkaan hay?","The correct answer is **B: Teen 22-saalah safar karney waley eek saath**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states hostels *specifically* cater to young people.** (""Hostels bilkhusus naujawanon - bees salah umar waale khaas mahmanon kee mezbani kartay hain"")
* A group of 22-year-olds fits this demographic perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Naw molood key saath safar karney walaa eek jodaa (A couple traveling with a newborn):** Hostels are generally not geared towards families with very young babies.
* **C: Apney 70vein mein eek jodaa (A couple in their 70s):** While not *excluded*, hostels primarily target a younger crowd.
* **D: Apney bachchon key saath safar karney waley do khandaan (Two families traveling with their children):** The passage states families are *rare* in hostels (""Bachon key saath khandaan shaaz wo naadir dekhnay co miltay hain""), although some offer private rooms that *may* accommodate them.  This isn't the primary clientele.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsaa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr boomerang fenkney ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Sirf kuch boomerang waapas honey key qaabil hein** (Only some boomerangs are capable of returning).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""to iss baat co yaqeeni banayein kahh aap key paas aisa bomerang ho ju waps aaney key mozon ho"" (make sure you have a boomerang that is capable of returning).  It also mentions many boomerangs found in Australia don't return. This directly supports the idea that *not all* boomerangs return, only certain ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar sahee sey fenka jaye to yehh hamesha aap key haath mein waapas aaye gaa** (If thrown correctly, it will always return to your hand) - The passage doesn't guarantee a return *even if* thrown correctly, only that the boomerang *must be capable* of returning.
* **B: Sayyahon key moqabiley maqami logon mein yehh ziyadah mashhoor hay** (It is more popular among locals than tourists) - The passage doesn't discuss the popularity of boomerangs among different groups.
* **C: Australia mein bahut ziyadah boomerang dastiyaab nahein hein** (There are not many boomerangs available in Australia) - The passage states the opposite - ""Ziyadah boom rengs australia mean payee jaati hain"" (Many boomerangs are found in Australia).



"
Buniyaadi tor parr darjah zail mein sey kon Javanese kaana mein istemaal hoti hein?,"The text states: ""...specially Javanese coconut sugar (cheeni (khaas tor purr jawiyani key naril kee cheeni))...""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Nariyal ki shakkar (Coconut sugar)**."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, koyi motaddi beemari kaisey failti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mutaadi marz wah bemari hay ju marz key awamil kee wajah say hoti hay, jaise wires, bacterium, fungus yaa deegar tafili jaraseem."" 

This translates to: ""A contagious disease is one that occurs due to the factors of the disease, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasitic germs.""

Therefore, a contagious disease (mutaddi beemari) spreads because of **pathogens** (the disease-causing agents like viruses, bacteria, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Motassirah log (Affected people)** - Affected people *spread* the disease, but they aren't *how* it spreads.
*   **C: Bacterium** - Bacterium is *a type* of pathogen, but the text lists multiple types of pathogens, so it's not the broad answer.
*   **D: Vaccination** - Vaccination *prevents* disease, it doesn't explain how it spreads.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi motaddi beemari key sabab bananey key liye kiya mashhoor nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Vaccination**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a *mutadi marz* (contagious disease) is caused by:

*   wires (viruses)
*   bacterium (bacteria)
*   fungus
*   deegar tafili jaraseem (other parasitic germs)

Vaccination *prevents* contagious diseases, it doesn't *cause* them. Therefore, it's the only option not listed as a cause.



"
kis manzar naamah mein zaati VPN parr kisi web proxy ka intekhaab karnaa saarif key liye kaafi hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Saarif ko censorship aur jahaan tak mumkin ho jasusi sey bachney ki fikar hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that private VPNs are best for bypassing political censorship, commercial IP-based filtering, and improving security.** It highlights their encryption and difficulty to spy on.
* **Option B directly reflects these concerns:** censorship and avoiding surveillance/spying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saarif tamaam traffic ka rastah badalna chahata hay:** While VPNs *do* change all traffic routes, this isn't the primary *reason* to choose a VPN over a web proxy, as the passage explains.  Proxies often only handle HTTP traffic.
* **C: Saarif buniyaadi tor parr http traffic ka rastah badal rahaa hay:**  A web proxy is sufficient for basic HTTP traffic redirection, so a VPN wouldn't be necessary.
* **D: Saarif ki sargarmi ko aala satah bandwidth parr eek motadil ki darkaar hay:** The passage mentions VPNs generally offer better bandwidth, but this isn’t the defining reason to *choose* a VPN over a proxy.  Bandwidth needs don't automatically necessitate a VPN.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, VPNs aur web proxy key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: VPNs sirf http traffic ka rastah badal sakta hay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""wah [VPNs] sarf each tea tea pie http kaa hee nahein, balkah internet key tamaam traffic kaa naya rasta banatay hain.""  This means VPNs *do not* only change the route of HTTP traffic, but *all* internet traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: VPNs aam tor parr web proxy sey ziyaadah aala bandwidth ki pesh kash karta hay** - The passage says VPNs ""aam toor purr aaliya bendoth our khadmat kaa behtarmayar pesh kartay hain"" (generally offer higher bandwidth and better service).
* **B: Web proxy tamaam web traffic ka rasta nahein badal sakta** - The passage states web proxies only change the route for HTTP traffic.
* **C: Web proxy mein VPNs ki ba nisbat kam tarr khidmat ka meyaar hota hay** - This is also supported by the statement about VPNs offering a *better* standard of service.



Therefore, option D directly contradicts the information provided in the passage."
Apney fauri elaqay sey baahar kisi phone ki company ka istemaal karney kissi shakhs ko kiya ijazat deti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Internet key raastey waali calein (Calls over the internet)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Chonkeh calls internet key raastay jaati hain, lahaza jahaan aap rehte hain yaa safar kartay hain vahan mojud kasee phone company key istemaal kee zaroorat nahein hay"" - meaning Chonkeh calls go over the internet, so you don't need to use a local phone company where you live or travel.  The rest of the passage details *how* you can achieve this (satellite internet, choosing a number from a different location) but the *permission* to use a phone company outside your immediate area comes from using internet-based calls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aalami phone key number (International phone number)** - While the passage mentions buying an international number, it's a *result* of needing to use a different location, not the permission itself.
* **C: Satellitein (Satellites)** -  Satellites are a *method* of getting internet access, which then *allows* for internet calls, but are not the permission itself.
* **D: PSTN key phone (PSTN phone)** - PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone system. The passage explains how to *avoid* needing to use it.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, makhsus kalein wosul karney keliye kis cheez ki zarurat ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek aalami number kharidein (Buy an international number)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aksar aap cow eek aalimi number alga say kharidna padta hay ju aap key liye pie ees tea een phone say call karnaa mumkin banata hay."" (Often you have to buy an international number separately which allows you to make calls from a PSTN phone.)

This directly indicates that to access certain connections (like making calls via a PSTN phone when in a remote area), you might *need* to buy an international number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eek maqami phone company istemaal karein (Use a local phone company):** The passage specifically says you *don't* need a local phone company.
* **C: Apni maqami community sey eek number haasil karein (Get a number from your local community):**  The passage explicitly says getting a local number isn't a requirement.
* **D: Eek PSTN phone khridein (Buy a PSTN phone):** The passage says you need a number *to use with* a PSTN phone, not to buy the phone itself.

Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr itli zubaan key alfaaz key talaffuz ki wazahat nahein karti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ziyadah tar alfaaz ka talaffuz darjah zail horooge ellat ki buniyaad parr mukhtalif hota hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Italian zubaan kaa talaffuz nisbatan aasaan hota hay keunkah ziyadah ther alfaz balkal asee tarah bolay jaatay hain jis tarah likhay jaatay hain."" (Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because many words are spoken almost exactly as they are written.) This directly *contradicts* the statement in option D that most words are pronounced differently based on the following letters.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

* **A: Eek doharey r ka talaffuz wahid r sey mukhtalif tor parr hota hay** (The pronunciation of a double 'r' is different from a single 'r') - The passage explicitly mentions the difference between 'ar' and 'rr'.
* **B: Aksar alfaaz ka talaffuz usi tarah hota hay jaisey unhein likhaa jaata hay** (Often, words are pronounced as they are written) - This is the main point of the passage!
* **C: Horoof c aur g waley alfaaz mushkil ho saktay hein** (Words with the letters 'c' and 'g' can be difficult) - The passage mentions 'see' and 'jee' as letters needing special attention, implying they can be tricky.



Therefore, only option D presents information *not* supported by the text, and in fact, is contrary to the text’s core message."
Izmir ki darjah zail konsi khosusiyaat jadid zamaanah sey pahley paida hui theen?,"The correct answer is **A: Wasee boulevard (Wide boulevards)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yahaan key kashadah balwaar...yeah sub iss shehar co meady trainin europ kee nah kahh rawayati tarki kee fazaa ataa kartay hain."" (Here, the wide boulevards... all of this gives the city a blend of modern European and traditional Turkish atmosphere.)

This implies the wide boulevards existed *before* the modern elements and contributed to the city's original character. 

The other options are clearly modern developments:

*   **B: Samaney sheeshey ki khosusiyat waali emaratein (Buildings with glass facades)** - These are modern architectural features.
*   **C: Kharidari key marakiz (Shopping centers)** - Shopping centers are a modern invention.
*   **D: Surkh tile waali chatein (Red tiled roofs)** - While not *extremely* modern, these are more associated with newer constructions alongside modern designs, not the original historical fabric of the city.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Izmir ki durust Khosusiyat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Aap jadid kharidari key maraakiz aur puraney church dono ko talaash kar saktey hein** (You can find modern shopping centers and old churches both).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yahaan key kashadah balwaar, saamney say sheesha lagi emaraat, our modern shopping centres...18 vein sadee kaa bazaar, praani masjadein..."" (Here, spacious boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, modern shopping centers...18th-century bazaars, historic mosques...)

* This clearly says there are *masjids* (mosques), not *churches*.  The passage highlights the traditional Turkish elements, and churches wouldn't fit that description in the context of Izmir as described.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Shahar eek baday khaleej ko gherey huey hay** (The city is surrounded by a large bay) - The passage says ""ju eek bury khaleej key gird hay"" (which is around a large bay).
* **B: Mahaul rewayati turkii ki akkasi karta hay** (The atmosphere reflects traditional Turkey) - The passage states it ""ataa kartay hain meady trainin europ kee nah kahh rawayati tarki kee fazaa"" (gives a space that is not a training ground for Europe but a traditional Turkish atmosphere).
* **D: Iss mein turkii ka doosra sabsey bada port hay** (It has Turkey's second-largest port) - The passage says ""istambul key baad doosri bury bandargah"" (second largest port after Istanbul).



"
Hanami lafz kiss cheez key nazarah kaa hawalah deta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry khilti hay** (Cherry blossoms bloom).

Here's why:

The passage states that Hanami originated from a tradition in China where *plum blossoms* were the chosen flowers, but then developed in Japan around *cherry blossoms* (cheery blasam). The whole practice revolves around viewing and celebrating these blooming flowers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Japan ki ashrafiyat** (Japanese aristocracy): While the passage mentions early Hanami parties were limited to the emperor and court, Hanami itself isn't *about* the aristocracy.
* **C: Plum khilta hay** (Plum blossoms bloom): Plum blossoms were part of the *origin* of the tradition, but Hanami in Japan specifically focuses on cherry blossoms.
* **D: Raaj shaahi darbaar** (Royal court): The royal court was involved in the *early history* of Hanami, but it's not what the word ""Hanami"" refers to.



"
Cherry key khilney ka nazarah karney key liye waqf pahli dawaton ki mezbaani kisney ki tee?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan key shahanshah** (The Emperor of Japan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Japan mean pehli cheery blazam partiyon kee ziyafat shahanshah faqat apnay liye our shahanshahi darbar key gird woo pesh key arkaani ashrafiya key liye karta thaa."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the Emperor only for himself and the elite members of the imperial court.""

Therefore, the first feasts to view the cherry blossoms were hosted by the Emperor of Japan.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, yrroshalam ka darjah zail konsa marhalah kam az kam seyahat ki targeeb deney key liye mumkin hay?","The correct answer is **A: Shahar ki mazhabi ahmiyat (The city's religious importance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah shaharteen tauheedi mazahib yauni yahudiyat, masihiyat, our islam key layemuqads hay, our iss kaa maqaam eek rohani, deeni, our saqafati markaz kaa hay."" (This city is holy to the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and its status is that of a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.)  This directly highlights the religious importance as a key draw for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate as the *primary* reason for tourism promotion based on this text:

*   **B: Israel key darul hokumati shahr ka iska darja (Its status as Israel's capital city):** While mentioned, the passage also notes that many countries do *not* recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, making it a potentially divisive point for promotion.
*   **C: Iski saqafati pesh kashein (Its cultural presentation):**  The passage does mention culture, but it's framed *within* the context of religious significance.
*   **D: Bahut sey tarikhee maqamat (Many historical sites):** While true, the passage links the historical sites back to the city's religious and cultural importance.



Therefore, the most direct and emphasized reason for travel promotion, according to the provided text, is the city’s religious importance."
Darjah zail mein sey konsa ebarat mein iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh kiss cheez key liye yarroshalam mashhoor hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Seyasi asaro rosukh (Political influence)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:**
    * **Dilkash tareekh (Fascinating history):** ""Jodd yaa kee pahadi kaa yeah qadeem shehar apnay peeche hazron saal kee dilchasp tareekh rakhta hay."" (This ancient city on the hill of Zion has a fascinating history of thousands of years behind it).
    * **Mazhabi ahmiyat (Religious importance):** ""Yeah shaharteen tauheedi mazahib yauni yahudiyat, masihiyat, our islam key layemuqads hay..."" (This city is holy for the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam...).
    * **Saqafati maqamat (Cultural sites):** ""Eroshulam mean bhat see tarikhi, asree, our saqafati sites hain."" (Jerusalem has many historical, modern, and cultural sites).

* **Political influence (Seyasi asaro rosukh)** is *not* directly mentioned as a reason for Jerusalem's fame in the passage.  While the passage *does* mention the political dispute over its status as Israel's capital (being unrecognized by many countries), it doesn't state that this political influence *is what* makes the city famous. It's presented as a *context* surrounding the city.



Therefore, **B** is the answer because it's the only option that isn't specifically highlighted as a reason for Jerusalem's renown in the provided text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism key mosaafir ko jangali card kharidney sey fayedah nahein hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Eek mosaafir jo sirf Kruger qomi Park ka daurah karr raha hay (A traveler who is only visiting Kruger National Park)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Wild Card is beneficial for those who plan to visit *either* a selection of SANParks *or* *all* of South Africa’s national parks.  If someone is *only* visiting Kruger, the cost of the Wild Card wouldn't be worth it as it's designed for multiple park visits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The Wild Card *specifically* facilitates visiting many SANParks, so this traveler *would* benefit.
* **C:** The passage mentions the entrance fee is a consideration, but the Wild Card addresses this by offering a cost-effective solution for frequent visitors.
* **D:** This traveler *would* benefit, as the Wild Card covers multiple parks.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Kruger qomi Park ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yehh jonubi Africa key qomi parkon mein sabsey chota hay**.

Here's why:

The passage states Kruger National Park covers 19,500 square kilometers. It also mentions it's one of the most important of the South African National Parks (seen parks). This implies it's *not* the smallest. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Issey jonubi Africa ki asal kashish samjha jaata hay** - The passage states, ""Yeah janubi afriqah kee bunyaadi purkashish jighon mean say eek hay"" (It's one of South Africa's fundamental tourist attractions).
* **B: Park key bahut sey ecozone mein jangli zindagi mukhtalif hoti hay** - The passage says it's divided into 14 different ecological areas, each suitable for different wildlife.
* **D: Yehh jangali card kharidney key zariyah aaney walon key liye qabile rasayi hay** - The passage mentions the benefit of a ""wild card"" for access to South African parks, including Kruger.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon pahad key ziyadah khadey hisson parr chadhney walon key liye sabsey ziyadah khatarnaki ki wajah bananey ka imkaan hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tarr surate haal (Slippery conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...toqaa cro kahh tumhara sans leena mashkal hoga our bhegi haalat mean ziyadah chhachlay hasoon mean utarnay say ahtiyaat karein kiyon kahh yeah alee alfoor khatarnaak ho sakta hay.""  This translates to ""...expect that your breathing will be difficult and be careful descending slippery slopes, because it can be very dangerous.""  

While the other options present challenges, the passage *specifically* warns about the danger of slippery conditions, especially when descending.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *most* dangerous:

* **B: Patthar key qadam (Stone steps):** While challenging, steps are a built feature to *aid* climbing.
* **C: Chotey gaar (Small cave):** The passage describes this as narrow and low, more of an inconvenience than a major danger for those already climbing.  You have to *go through* it, but it doesn't directly impact the climb itself.
* **D: Steel key taar (Steel cables):** These are *assisting* devices for the climb, providing support.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah ebarat mein wazahat kardah Machu Picchu pahaad ki chadhaayi ki durust tor parr akkaasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Neez fit chadhney walon ki bhee saans band honaa mumkin hogaa** (Even fit climbers might find themselves short of breath).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""itnaa kahnay key baad, toqaa cro kahh tumhara sans leena mashkal hoga"" (after saying all this, be aware that your breathing might become difficult).  This directly supports the idea that even fit people will struggle with the climb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ziyadah khaday hisson mein koyi handrail nahein hein** (There are no handrails in the steep sections) - The passage *does* mention steel cables as aids for hands in the steep sections (""steel key taar maawin daston kaa kaam kartay hain"").
* **C: Aap ko choti par kisi gaar key zariyah guzarna zaruri hay** (You have to pass through a cave near the peak) -  The passage mentions a very small, low cave that *should* be avoided (""choti key qareeb eek chhota saw ghar mojud hay jasay abur kiya jaana zaruri hay""). It's not a necessary passage.
* **D: Tarr honay key waqt ziyadah khadey hissey khatarnaak ho jaatey hein** (Steep sections become dangerous when wet) - The passage mentions being careful when descending on wet, slippery slopes (""bhegi haalat mean ziyadah chhachlay hasoon mean utarnay say ahtiyaat karein""). While true, it's about *descending*, not generally about the steep sections themselves.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon Majorcan khana ka asal staple nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Anaaj**

Here's why:

The passage describes Majorcan cuisine as featuring bread, vegetables, and meats (especially pork), using olive oil. It specifically mentions *roti* (flatbread) as a common part of meals.  It also mentions vegetables as being used in dishes. Meat is prominently highlighted as well (especially pork).

However, **anaaj (grains)** isn't specifically mentioned as a staple *in itself*. Bread (made *from* grains) is mentioned, but not grains as a primary food item. The focus is on what goes *into* the bread or is served *with* it.

Therefore, anaaj is the least likely to be considered a core staple based on the provided text.



"
"Ebarat ki malumaat ki buniyaad parr, hangi khanon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Geothermal hangi bartan garam karney key liye aag sey garam pattharon ka istemaal kartey hein.**

Here's why:

The text states that *either* hot stones heated by fire *or* geothermal heat are used to heat the hangi. It doesn't say geothermal hangi *use fire-heated stones*.  Geothermal hangi rely on the earth's natural heat.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Hangi ka garam patthar istemaal karnaa Wellington mein dastiyaab nahein hay:** The text specifically mentions examples of hangi stones being taken from Christchurch and Wellington, implying they *are* used there.
* **C: Bhuna hua raat ka khana aksar hangi istemaal kartey huey pakaya jaata hay:** The text states, ""Rawayati angithi tarz purr raat kaa khaana pakanay keliye aksar haingi kaa istemaal kiya jaataa hay"" (Traditionally, hangi is often used to cook dinner).
* **D: Geothermal hangi ko Rotorua mein paya ja saktaa hay:** The text says, ""Rotovrah mean mutadid maqamat zamini haandi pesh kartay hain"" (Rotorua has several geothermal areas presenting hangi).



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko hangi bartan garam karney key liye aam tariqah key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Gas**.

Here's why:

The passage states that food is cooked in underground ovens heated by:

*   **Hot stones (Garam Pathron)** - explicitly mentioned.
*   **Geothermal heat (Geothermal Garmi)** - explicitly mentioned.

The passage also mentions using an *angithi* (traditional hearth) for cooking, but doesn't specify *how* that hearth is heated – it doesn’t mention gas. While an angithi *could* be heated with gas, it's not mentioned as a traditional method *in this passage*.

Therefore, **Gas** is the only option not mentioned as a traditional way to heat the cooking vessels.

**Note:** Options B and D are the same (Garam Patthar/Hot Stones). This is likely a mistake in the question, but the correct answer remains A."
Kis cheez ki wajah sey kisi rahib ya raahibah ki taraf sey khosusi shanakhat hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek chamakdaar dhanka hua lehaaf odhna (Wearing a brightly colored covering)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...agar aap apni chaadar, khaas tor purr chamakdar rangon waali laatay hain, to darwazay purr rahib yaa rahibah maskarahat key saath aap kaa kheer muqadam karay gee.""  This directly translates to: ""...if you bring your own shawl, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun will greet you with a smile at the door.""  This implies the bright shawl *causes* the special recognition from the monk/nun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apney kandhon ko dhanknaa (Covering one's shoulders):**  While covering shoulders is *required* for women, it's standard practice and doesn't result in special treatment.
* **C: khanqaah sey eek lehaaf udhaar lenaa (Borrowing a shawl from the khanqah):** The text mentions borrowing shawls are available for those who don't bring one, but it doesn’t indicate this leads to special recognition.
* **D: Ghutno key oper sey kati eek skirt pahanana (Wearing a skirt cut above the knees):** This is a requirement for women, not something that earns special attention.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey kapday ki ashyaa mumkanah tor parr kisi khanaqaah sey udhaar leney key liye dastiyaab nahein hay? ,"The correct answer is **B: Short**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states women are required to wear skirts that go *below the knees*. It also states men need to wear trousers (pyjama). It mentions women can borrow shawls (chaadrein) and men can borrow coverings (lehaaf). However, it *doesn't* mention shorts being available for either men or women. In fact, the requirement for women to cover their shoulders and wear below-the-knee skirts implies shorts would be inappropriate and therefore not provided.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

*   **A: Skirt:** The passage states skirts are *required* for women, and may be available to borrow.
*   **C: Trouser:** Trousers (pyjama) are *required* for men and may be available to borrow.
*   **D: lehaaf:** The passage specifically mentions men can borrow a covering/shawl (lehaaf).



"
Antarctic elaqon ka daurah kartey waqt kabb eek mosaafir key paas sitaron ko dekhney key liye sabsey ziyadah mawaqey hotey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosame sarmaa key mahino key doraan (During the winter months)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that during the polar night (which happens in the winter months in the Arctic and Antarctica) the sun doesn't rise above the horizon, resulting in consistently dark skies. This darkness provides the best opportunity to see the aurora borealis and enjoy stargazing due to the lack of sunlight and (as the passage notes) typically low light pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mosame garma key mahino key doraan (During the summer months)** - The passage says the *opposite* is true; summer has more sunlight.
*   **B: Jabb elaqah aabadi walaa na ho (When the area is uninhabited)** - While less populated areas *help* with stargazing, the key factor described in the passage is the darkness of polar night.
*   **D: Jabb roshni ki aaludgi ki satah kam ho (When the level of light pollution is low)** - Again, while true, the passage emphasizes the *cause* of dark skies - the polar night - rather than simply low light pollution.



"
Kabb koyi satellite phone kisi cell phone kaa qabile amal badlah nahi hogaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Agar iska baahar mein istemaal hota hogaa** (If it is used outdoors).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*aap cow eek phone call karnay key liye satellite key saamney waazah line key saath baahir honaa zaruri hay*."" (…you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call).  This means a satellite phone won't be a viable substitute for a cell phone when you *need* to be outdoors for it to function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar satellite ki taraf jaaney wali nazar ki line ruki ho sakti ho** (If the line of sight to the satellite could be blocked): This is *a* problem for satellite phones, but the passage doesn't say it makes them unusable *compared* to cell phones. It's a limitation of the technology itself.
* **B: Agar mahalle waqoo bahut door ho** (If the local situation is very far): Distance is the entire *point* of using a satellite phone - they work where cell towers don't reach.
* **D: Agar kisi muhim ko makhsus data ki zaruriyaat darkaar ho** (If a mission requires specific data needs): The passage focuses on voice and basic communication, not specific data requirements.



"
Kabb kisi satellite phone ko cell phone parr tarjeeh di jaye gee?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisi kashti key safar key doraan (During a voyage on a ship)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are often used by ""shipping bashmol tafrihi kashti nez muham jowon"" (shipping, recreational boats, and adventurers) who need communication in remote locations. This directly relates to being on a voyage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar mein chutti manatey waqt (While on vacation in the city):**  The passage says satellite phones are *not* a substitute for mobile phones when coverage is available. Cities have cell phone coverage.
* **C: Jabb door ka data zaruri na ho (When remote data is not necessary):** The passage highlights the use of satellite phones *when* remote communication (data and voice) is needed.
* **D: Jabb mumkanah tor parr aap key paas kaafi cell phone coverage ho (When you have sufficient cell phone coverage):** This is the opposite of when you'd need a satellite phone.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiss parr tanazo Transnistria jamhuriyah key bananey ka baaes bana?,"The correct answer is **A: Eqtesaad (Economy)**.

Here's why:

The text states that political negotiations failed, but *economic ties* between Moldova and Transnistria have been re-established. This implies a key driver of the conflict and the creation of Transnistria was related to economic factors. The text doesn't mention ethnic, linguistic, or religious conflicts as the *cause* of Transnistria's formation, though it acknowledges Moldova as a multi-ethnic republic. It focuses on the political outcome (Transnistria declaring independence) and the subsequent re-establishment of economic links.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Transnistria jamhuriyah mein hay jo Moldova key baaqi sey mukhtalif hay?  ,"The correct answer is **C: UN ka tasleem karna** (UN recognition).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...jis kee apni hukumat our currency hay leakin asay kasee bhee un member milk kee jaanib say tasleem nahein kiya gayaa hay.""  This translates to ""...it has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member states.""  This is the key difference between Transnistria and the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zubaan (Language)** - The passage states Romanian is the official language of Moldova, but Russian is widely used. Transnistria also uses Russian, so it's not a *defining* difference.
*   **B: Mazhab (Religion)** - The passage says Christianity is the predominant religion in Moldova; it doesn't provide information about the religion in Transnistria making it not a defining difference.
*   **D: Currency** - While Transnistria *has* its own currency, the passage indicates Moldova also has economic ties with Transnistria, implying currency exchange happens, so it's not a fundamental distinction.



"
"Agar wohh hawadaar surate haal sey bachney ki ummid kar rahey hein to Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko Montevideo ka kabb daurah karnaa chaiye?","The correct answer is **A: Shumaali Hemisphere key mosame sarmaa key mahino key doraan (During the winter months of the Northern Hemisphere)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jib shamali nasf kuray mean sardi hoti hay our asee tarah mukhalif bhee aisa hee hota hay"" which translates to ""when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and the opposite is also true."" This means Montevideo experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter, and vice versa.

The passage also says Montevideo has hot summers (over 30 degrees Celsius) and surprisingly cold winters (sometimes below freezing, *feeling* even colder due to wind and humidity).

Therefore, to avoid the hot and humid weather, a traveler should visit during the Northern Hemisphere's winter months.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Montevideo key khushk season key doraan (During Montevideo's dry season):** The passage states there's no specific dry season; rainfall is consistent throughout the year.
*   **C: Shumaali Hemisphere key mosame garmaa key mahino key doraan (During the summer months of the Northern Hemisphere):** This would be Montevideo's summer - the hottest time to visit.
*   **D: Montevideo key mosame sarmaa key mahino key doraan (During Montevideo's winter months):**  This would be the coldest time to visit, and the passage indicates it can be quite harsh."
"Agar wohh ziyadah thandey mosam key liye janibdaar hein to ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi mosaafir ko Montevideo ka daurah kabb karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Jabb Montevideo mein mosame garmaa ho** (When it is summer in Montevideo).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Monte video zeeli madareen mean hay; garmiyon key maheenon mean, 30 degree senti grade say zayed darjehahrarat aam hain."" (Montevideo is in the southern latitudes; during the summer months, temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common.)

And it also contrasts this with: ""Mausam surma hairat angez toor purr thanda hosakta hay…"" (The weather in winter can be surprisingly cold…)

The question asks for the best time to visit *if someone prefers warmer weather*.  Therefore, visiting during Montevideo's summer is the logical choice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jabb Shumaali Hemisphere mein mosame garmaa ho** - The passage specifically links Montevideo's weather to being in the *Southern* Hemisphere, and how its seasons are opposite to the Northern Hemisphere.
* **C: Jabb yehh Montevideo ka barish ka season ho** - The passage states rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year. It doesn’t suggest a specific rainy season that would be preferable.
* **D: Jabb shumaali Hemisphere mein mosame sarmaa ho** -  This would be Montevideo's summer (opposite seasons), but the question asks for a time someone *who prefers warm weather* would visit.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon eek mustahkam graffiti fankaar sey wabastah is tor parr wabastah hogaa kehh wohh gunda gardi key khilaaf ho?","The passage discusses unwanted sculptures or writings (graffiti) and how they are often associated with vandalism, especially by youth damaging public and private property. It contrasts this with the artistic aspect, acknowledging graffiti *can* be a natural expression. However, the *perception* leans towards it being linked to destructive behavior.

The question asks which term would be most associated with a graffiti artist *opposed* to vandalism. Let's break down the options:

* **A: Graffiti taqribaat (Graffiti approximations):** This sounds vague and doesn't inherently suggest anti-vandalism.
* **B: likhawat (Writing/Calligraphy):** While graffiti *involves* writing, this term is too broad and doesn’t link to an opposition to damaging property.
* **C: Awami jayedaad parr gair matlubah deewarein (Unwanted walls on public property):** This *describes* the problem, not a solution or a stance against vandalism. It's a negative description of graffiti itself.
* **D: Najayez tagz (Illegal tags):** This refers to the *act* of vandalism - creating unwanted markings - and is the opposite of what we're looking for.

Considering the passage's overall tone, and seeking the option suggesting an artist *against* vandalism, **B: likhawat (Writing/Calligraphy)** is the closest.  The passage acknowledges graffiti *can* be a form of artistic expression, and 'likhawat' highlights the skill of writing which suggests a potentially more artistic, less destructive approach. While not perfect, it's the least negative and most artistically inclined option.



Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
Mosiqee tehwaron key konsey zawiyah ko kuchh shorakaa tajrabah ka aham hissah samajhtey hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Site parr camp karnaa (Camping on site)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agar aap action co balkal qareeb say dekhna chahte hain to aap co mausiqi key qareeb camping key maqaam purr jagah paaney keliye jaldi jaana hoga."" (If you want to see the action up close, you'll need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.)  It explicitly states that many attendees *considered the experience of camping* a big part of the festival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chotey bachchon ko lanaa (Bringing small children):**  While the passage mentions family areas, it doesn't say this is *considered a key part of the experience* by many attendees.
* **C: Derr raat mosiqee chalanaa (Late night music):** The passage mentions music continuing late into the night, but doesn't imply attendees *seek it out* as a central experience.
* **D: Jaldi sey aana (Arriving early):** Arriving early is *necessary* to camp, but the camping itself is the experience being highlighted, not the early arrival.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar eek tehwaari shareek mosiqee sey qareeb camp karnaa chahey to ussey kiss cheez ko tarjeeh deni chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Jaldi sey aana (Coming early)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agar aap action co balkal qareeb say dekhna chahte hain to aap co mausiqi key qareeb camping key maqaam purr jagah paaney keliye **jaldi jaana hoga**.""  This directly translates to ""If you want to see the action up close, you will have to **come early** to find a place to camp near the music.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Derr raat janaa (Coming late at night)** - The passage explicitly says to come *early*, not late.
*   **B: Khandano key liye eek elaqah mein qiyaam karnaa (Staying in an area for families)** - While the passage mentions areas for families, it doesn't suggest this is necessary for camping near the music.
*   **C: Site sey alag camp karna (Camping away from the site)** - The passage specifically states wanting to camp *near* the music."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Shumaali New Mexico mein raat ki zindagi haasil kartey waqt daurah karney walon ko kahaan sey bachna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Chotey shahron key baar** (Small town bars).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Khabardar: chhoti bastion key baar yaa zarabgahein pardesiyon key liye aaney our bethnay key liye hamishah achhi jaghein nahein hotein."" This translates to ""Beware: small town bars or roadside places are not always good places for outsiders to come and sit.""  The text explicitly warns against these places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The text mentions Pueblos are far away, but doesn’t warn against them specifically.
*   **C: Maall:** Malls aren’t mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Casino:** The text states casinos *offer* drinks and are generally accessible.



"
Ebarat key hisaab sey shumaali New Mexico mein mashhoor tafreeh ko eek daurah karney keliye panaa kitnaa mumkin hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Sante Fe key paas eek casino mein** (A casino near Santa Fe).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tahim, oper fehrist kardah taqriban tamaam casino mashrubaat farahim kartay hain, our unn mean say aksar naami brand tafrih laatay hain (bunyadi tor purr bury waali ju fouri albaqarqo our santa fay kaa gherao kurti hain).""  This translates to: ""Therefore, almost all of the listed casinos provide drinks and many offer well-known brands of entertainment (primarily those near Albuquerque and surrounding Santa Fe).""

This directly implies that casinos near Santa Fe are a common source of entertainment in Northern New Mexico.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Albuquerque sey do ghantey ki doori parr eek casino mein** (A casino within two hours of Albuquerque) - While casinos are mentioned near Albuquerque, the passage focuses on entertainment in *Northern* New Mexico, linking it specifically to Santa Fe.
* **B: Eek door key pueblo mein** (A distant pueblo) - The passage mentions pueblos are far away and you can't experience nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
* **D: Eek chotey shahar key baar mein** (A small town's bar) - The passage *warns* against small town bars, stating they aren't always good for tourists.

Bajat sey bedaar mosaafiron ko kiss qism key mashroob sey bachney ki chahat ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia ki sharaab (Australian wine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pinay key liye bhat see francisi sharabein mojud hain, tahim newzi land our australia kee sharabein behatar safar kirr sakti hain.""  This translates to ""There are many French wines available in Penang, however New Zealand and Australian wines travel better.""

This implies that Australian wines are a good option *for travel*, but not necessarily the *best* choice for budget-conscious travellers - potentially meaning they are more expensive. The question asks what budget travellers might want to *avoid*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kashti walaa paani (Ship water):** The passage discusses tap and bottled water, not ship water.
* **C: Maqami beer (Local beer):** The passage describes local beers positively (""khushgawar our taazgi bakhash"" - pleasant and refreshing).
* **D: Fal ka juice (Fruit juice):** The passage says fruit juice is expensive (""mahnga"") but good (""khoob hay""), not that it should be avoided by budget travellers.



"
"Ebarat mein wazah elaqah ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsey mashroob key order ko eek server key zariyah mashkuk honey ka imkaan hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek flat safed** (A flat white).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Australiyayi baashindon keliye """"fleet kaafi"""" kaa tasavur gher manoos hay."" This translates to ""For Australian residents, the concept of a 'flat white' is unfamiliar.""  This directly implies that a server might question an order for a flat white because it's not commonly known in that region.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be questioned:

* **A: Eek mukhtasar siyaah (A short black/espresso):** The text *defines* ""short black"" as espresso, so a server wouldn't be confused.
* **B: Eek number walaa (A number one):** The text introduces ""number one"" as a local beer and describes it. A server would likely understand this is a request for that beer.
* **C: New Zealand ka eek Sauvignon Blanc (A New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc):** The text mentions New Zealand wines are good for travel and readily available, indicating they would be understood.



"
"Teeno mulkon key liye barqaraar rahtey huey, samraaji zamanah kiss jamaat ney shuru kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""16vein sadee eiswi pragway jasay pehle """"dye giant prons aaf dye indies"""" kahaa jaataa thaa, kaa janam maqami desi jamaaton key saath spiny fateheen key saath ladayi key natijah mean wajood mean aaya thaa. Spiniyon nay mustaariyat ahed kaa aaghaz kiya ju then sadee thak barqarar rehaa."" 

This translates to: ""The 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as ""the giant provinces of the Indies,"" came into being as a result of a battle with the native indigenous communities and the Spanish conquerors. The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted until the 19th century.""

Therefore, the Spanish (Spiniyon) started the colonial period which persisted for three countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Payaguá:** The text mentions Payaguá as one of the local tribes existing *before* colonization.
*   **B: Guaycurú:**  Similar to Payaguá, Guaycurú were a local tribe.
*   **C: Guaraní:** Guaraní are also identified as a native group existing before and alongside the Spanish, not the initiators of colonization.



"
"Ebarart key hisaab sey, paris key kisi bashindey ko aap key liye warm up kareny kaa behtareen tariqah kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mohazzab amal karnaa (Polite behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...peers mean jaaney kaa sub say behtareen tariqah achhaa royah pesh karnaa our aise shakhas kee tarah amal karnaa hay jis kee prorish achhi hoyee ho.""  This translates to: ""...the best way to get along with Parisians is to present good manners and act like someone who was well-bred.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Paris key bashindey key rawayyah ki taqleed karney ki koshish (Trying to imitate the behavior of Parisians):** While understanding their style is helpful, the passage focuses on *your* behavior and presenting good manners. It doesn't suggest mimicry.
* **B: Etemaad nikalnaa (To trust):** Trust is important, but the passage doesn't mention it as a primary way to make a good impression.
* **D: Kharijee soluk ki nomaesh karnaa (Demonstrating rude behavior):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage recommends.  The passage implies Parisians might be perceived as arrogant, but advises against responding in kind.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Paris key logon ki daqyanoosi sifat samjhaa jaata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ghamand (Arrogance/Pride)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Paris key baashinde khud gharz, gher mahzab our **maghrur** honey kee haisiyat say shahrat rakhtay hain."" (Paris residents are known for being self-centered, non-religious and **arrogant**). 

The passage directly identifies *maghrur* (arrogant/proud) as a characteristic Parisians are known for. *Ghamand* is the Urdu translation of arrogance/pride.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Badtamizee (Rude behavior/Ill-manners):** While the passage suggests a need for good manners to navigate Paris, it doesn't *define* rudeness as a core trait of Parisians.
*   **C: Khelwaad (Playfulness/Fun):** The passage doesn't mention playfulness.
*   **D: Khalal andazi (Disruption/Interference):**  This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Cape Town ki MetroRail parr pahley darjah ka fayedah kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Coach train key samney hay** (Coach is at the front of the train).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metro pulse coaches *hamishah keep town key qareeb tareen train key aakhir mean hotay hain*."" This translates to ""Metro pulse coaches are *always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town*.""  Since ""keep town"" is Cape Town and the end of the train is the front, this means the first class (Metro Pulse) coaches are at the front of the train.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bahut sey log nahein hein (There aren't many people):** The passage doesn't mention passenger numbers.
* **C: Yehh teesrey darjah sey kam manhgaa hay (It is cheaper than third class):** The passage states Metro Pulse is *more expensive* than Metro (third class).
* **D: Iskaa Metro ticket key jitnaa hi kerayaa hay (Its fare is the same as a Metro ticket):** The passage states it's *more expensive* than a typical European metro ticket, implying it's also more expensive than the standard Metro ticket in Cape Town.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Cape Town ki harr mosaafir train mein kiya hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **D: Pahley aur teesrey dono darjey key coach** (Both first and third class coaches).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harr eek rail gaadi mean metro pulse our metro donon hee dabay hotay hain"" which translates to ""Each train has both Metro Pulse and Metro coaches.""  Metro Pulse is described as the first class and Metro as the third class.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek kam tar bheed walaa Metro coach** (A less crowded Metro coach) - While Metro Pulse *is* less crowded, the passage doesn't say *every* train has a less crowded Metro coach, only that Pulse is less crowded.
*   **B: Dono darjon key liye eek hi ticket ki qimat** (The same ticket price for both classes) - The passage says Metro Pulse is more expensive.
*   **C: Teen mukhtalif darjey** (Three different classes) - The passage only mentions two classes: Metro Pulse and Metro.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko eek janwar ka keeda keliye karnaa mumkin nahein hay?,"The passage states that powerful injuries caused by animals are ""generally not considered epidemics."" Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Taqatwar zakhamon ki wajah banana (Causing powerful wounds)**

Here's why:

* **A: Didora ki wajah banana (Causing irritation):** The passage explicitly mentions insects can cause inflammation.
* **B: Jalan wali allergy (Causing an allergic reaction):** Inflammation is a type of allergic reaction, and the passage links insects to causing inflammation.
* **C: Infection failanaa (Spreading infection):** The passage states insects can transmit infections.
* **D: Taqatwar zakhamon ki wajah banana (Causing powerful wounds):** The passage specifically excludes injuries from being considered epidemics, differentiating them from insect-borne diseases and issues.



"
Pesh adaegi phone key card ko kahaan kharidaa ja saktaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mod ki dukaano mein (Small shops/stores)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rehaishi elaqon kee harr chhoti dukaan mean paishgi adayegi kardah phone cards kee preshan kunn safon kee bharmaar hay...""  This directly translates to ""In every small shop in residential areas, there is a plethora of readily available pre-paid phone cards...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makhsus mamalik mein (In specific countries)** - The passage doesn't limit purchase to specific countries.
*   **B: Train stationo parr (At train stations)** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Phone ki adaegi karney mein (In phone payments)** - This doesn't make sense as a place to *buy* a phone card.



"
Kuchh rasaayi yaaftah cardon ney behtar call ki qimaton ki peshkash kaisey ki hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Toll free number key zariyah** (Through toll-free numbers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inn khidmaat thak rasayi aksar toll free telefon number key zariah hoti hay jis purr beshtar baghair balance charge key phone say call kee jasakti hay.""  This directly translates to ""Access to these services is often through toll-free numbers, where you can often make calls without a balance charge."" This explains *how* some cards offer better call rates - by using toll-free access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unn tak sirf makhsus mamalik mein rasaayi haasil ki jaa sakti hay** (They can only be accessed in specific countries) - The passage mentions some cards have *preferred rates* for specific countries, but doesn’t say access is limited to those countries.
* **C: Mod key store parr** (At the store) - The passage mentions the cards are *available* at stores, but doesn’t explain how they offer better rates.
* **D: Adaegi ka phone aur eek ezaafi phone ka charge istemaal kareky** (Using a payphone and an extra phone charge) - This contradicts the passage which implies the cards are *avoiding* extra charges.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa darakht Plitvice jheelon key qomi park mein kam aam hay?","The correct answer is **A: Sahile samundar (Seashore/Coastal trees)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the park's forests primarily consist of **beech (safeda), pine (sanobar), and oak (chid)**. It also mentions a unique combination of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  Coastal trees (sahile samundar) are not mentioned as being part of the park's vegetation.

* **Fir (C)** and **Spruce (D)** are types of pine/conifer trees and are mentioned as being present (""sanobar"").
* **Baloot (B)** is the Urdu word for Oak, which *is* mentioned (""chid"").

Therefore, seashore trees are the least common type of tree within Plitvice Lakes National Park, based on the provided text.



"
Darjah shaaz janwaron mein sey kon Plitvice jheelon key qomi park mein paya jaa sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nayaab haiwanat jaise kahh europi bhuray bhaalo, bhediye, baaz, aloo, lanks, jungli billy **our capreli** bahut say dosray aam aqsaam key saath dekhay jaa saktay hain.""  ""Capreli"" is the Urdu word for Capercaillie.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Turkey:** While turkeys exist, the passage doesn't mention them specifically being found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
* **B: Honey Badger:** Honey badgers are not native to this region of Europe.
* **C: Cassowary:** Cassowaries are found in Australia and New Guinea, not Europe.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Elaaqayi code asal mein kiskey saath taawun kartey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Bazaar ka control**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the real goal of media companies is to gain ""ziyadah control deena hay"" (more control in the market/bazaar). It argues that regional codes have *no* effect on illegal copying and are a smokescreen for this true intention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Disk naqal karnaa (Disk copying):** The passage *says* regional codes don't stop copying.
*   **C: Qazzaki ki rok thaam (Preventing piracy):** The passage argues this is a *lie* - they pretend it's about stopping piracy but it isn't.
*   **D: Gair qanooni naqal karnaa (Illegal copying):**  Again, the passage states regional codes don't affect illegal copying.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Khittah key code key baarey mein eek jhoot hay, jo media companiyon ney barqaraar rakha hay?","The correct answer is **B: Wohh gair qanooni naqal sey bachney mein madad kartey hein (They help in preventing illegal copying)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Media companiyan iss key maqsad say mutaliq lagatar jhoot bolti hain kahh yeah 'razdari roknay' keliye hay. Darr haqeeqat, gher qanuni kaapi karnay purr elaqayi code kaa qatyi koyee asra nahein hota hay.""  This translates to: ""Media companies constantly lie about the purpose of this, saying it's to 'prevent piracy.' In reality, regional codes for illegal copying have absolutely no effect.""

Therefore, the claim that these codes prevent illegal copying is the lie perpetuated by media companies, according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mazeed bazar control haasil karney key liye wohh zaruri hein (They are necessary to gain more market control)** - The passage *suggests* this is the *real* purpose, not a lie.
*   **C: Paisa katayi waley key liye wohh mofeed hay (They are beneficial for money launderers)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Qazzaki sey bachney mein wohh shaazo nadir madad kartey hein (They rarely help in preventing fraud)** - The passage doesn't discuss fraud prevention.



"
"Apney watan mein pahunchney key waqt, konsa marhalah aam tor parr gair rasmi hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Muntaqilee padtaalein (Transit inspections)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Jib aap apnay watan pahunchtay hain to immigration chek aam tor purr nahein hota yaa mamuli hota hay, leakin custom control mean aap co tang kiya jaa sakta hay..."" (When you reach your home country, immigration checks are usually not thorough or are minimal, but you can be questioned at customs control).

* This implies that *immigration checks* (which are part of the initial arrival process, often including a quick assessment of travel documents) are often less strict.  ""Muntaqilee padtaalein"" (transit inspections) falls into this category – it's often a quick look at your documents to confirm your identity and reason for entry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ashyaa ka elaan karnaa (Declaration of goods):** This is a *formal* requirement and part of customs, where you *will* be scrutinized.
* **C: Ashaya ki qanooni hodud (Legal limits of items):**  Knowing these limits is important, but it doesn't describe a stage of the process that is often informal.  In fact, exceeding these limits leads to *more* scrutiny.
* **D: Custom control:** The prompt specifically states that customs control is where you *can* be questioned - it's not informal.



"
Darjah zail mein kisko apney watan mein pahunchney sey pahley aap ko janana chahiye?,"The most accurate answer is **B: Agar aap ko qanooni hodud parr ashyaa ka elaan karney ki zarurat ho** (If you need to declare items at the legal limits).

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes knowing what you *can* and *cannot* legally bring into the country, and declaring items within legal limits.** This directly relates to understanding declaration requirements.
* While A, C, and D *could* be true, they are consequences of the core issue: knowing what you are legally allowed to bring and declaring it.  The passage focuses on being *prepared* to declare and stay within the law.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Agar wahan muntaqili checkpoint hoga (If there is a transfer checkpoint there):** Checkpoints are common, but the key point isn't *if* there is one, but what you need to do *at* it.
* **C: Agar custom control hogaa (If there is customs control):**  Similar to A, the *presence* of customs control isn't the main issue; it's knowing your obligations within that control.
* **D: Agar kisi ashyaa ko aap laa rahey hon to uski ejaazat na ho (If you are bringing an item that is not allowed):** This is a consequence of not knowing the rules, not the proactive step of being informed.

Therefore, option B best captures the essence of the passage's advice: **be sure you know what you can legally bring and declare it properly.**



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez ki kasrat chadhney waley ko mustaqil tor parr Cochamó waadi key andar naye raaston ko daryaaft karney ki ijaazat deti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Deewarein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""duniya key tamaam elaqon key koah paima muslisil iss kee dewaron key lamtanahi silsilon key darmiyan nayey raastay bananay key liye koshaan hain.""  This translates to: ""Climbers from all over the world are striving to create new routes between the endless chains of its walls.""

Therefore, it's the **walls** (deewarein) that provide the opportunity for climbers to discover new routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manazir (Views)**: While the views are mentioned as beautiful, they don't *allow* for route discovery.
*   **B: Sarbarahi ijlaas (Head start)**: This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Chotiyaan (Peaks)**: The passage mentions peaks are *part* of the scenery, but it's the walls that are being climbed on.



"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Jonubi Hemisphere mein ziyaadah tarr crossing kaa kon ehaatah karta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Albatah, star alayens tamaam elaqon kaa ahatah karta hay maaswaae Santiago dee chalee say tahiti thak mashriqi janubi behralkahil key, ju kahh latam oneworld flight hay.""  

This translates to: ""However, Star Alliance covers all areas except from Santiago to Tahiti across the eastern South Pacific, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.""

Therefore, Star Alliance covers the *most* crossings in the Southern Hemisphere, with the single exception noted being covered by LATAM Oneworld.



"
Konsey airline ka ettehaad Jonubi Hemisphere mein samundar crossing ki kam az kam miqdaar ka ehaatah karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""star alliance tamaam elaqon kaa ahatah karta hay maaswaae Santiago dee chalee say tahiti thak mashriqi janubi behralkahil key, ju kahh latam oneworld flight hay."" 

This translates to: ""Star Alliance covers all regions except the area from Santiago to Tahiti in the South Pacific, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.""  

This means Star Alliance has the *least* amount of ocean crossings required to circumnavigate the Southern Hemisphere, as it covers everything *except* that one specific route. The other alliances require more crossings overall.



"
Konsi daurah ki tanzeem alami dauraey karaney wali ki janasheeni ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Daurah karatey rahnaa (Keep running tours)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Global running tours kaa jansheen, **go running tours** key paas chaar baraazmon mean darjanon saait running providers kaa neat work hay."" 

This directly translates to: ""The successor to Global Running Tours, **Go Running Tours** has a neat work of dozens of running providers in four continents.""

Therefore, **Go Running Tours** is the successor.  ""Daurah karatey rahnaa"" is the translation of ""Go Running Tours"" in Urdu.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, daurah karatey rahnaa kitni mukhtalif nazarah waali tanzeemon sey rabetah karney mein madad karti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Darjano (Dozens)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...go running tours key paas chaar baraazmon mean **darjanon** saait running providers kaa neat work hay."" 

This directly translates to ""go running tours has a neat work of **dozens** of running providers in four continents.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chaar (Four):** While four continents are mentioned, the question asks about *organizations* or *providers*, not continents.
*   **B: 200:** The text mentions 200 *tours* are happening, not 200 organizations.
*   **D: Teen (Three):** This number isn't mentioned in relation to the number of organizations.



"
Sabsey ziyadah saaf shaffaaf mumkanah cheetah key nazarah ki agar koyi sayyah ummid kar raha hay to usey kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Doorbeen istemaal karein** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sher, cheetay our taindwe aam toor purr sharmile hotay hain our aap unn co durbeen say ziyadah behatar deekh sakein gay.""  This translates to ""Lions, cheetahs and leopards are generally shy and you can see them better with binoculars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Safari key eek paidal safar parr jayen** (Go on a walking safari) - While walking safaris exist, the text specifically says cheetahs are shy and *harder* to see without assistance.
* **B: Eek jhaadi ki chahal qadmi parr jayen** (Go to a bush within 40 steps) - This is not mentioned in the text and isn't a reliable way to see cheetahs.
* **D: Eek car lein aur meyaari saazo saaman istemaal karein** (Take a car and use quality equipment) -  The text mentions cars are good for seeing elephants and giraffes (animals that come closer), but *binoculars* are better for shy animals like cheetahs.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kis qism key janwar ka mumkanah tor parr eek daurah karney waley ko kisi gaadi mein safari ki muhim key doraan samnaa karna padey gaa?","The correct answer is **B: Jiraaf**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kachh janwar, jaise **haathi our jiraaf**, kaaron key qareeb aajate hain our mayari saamaan key zariah achhi tarah say dekhay jayein gay."" (Some animals, like **elephants and giraffes**, come close to cars and can be seen well with good equipment.)

While the passage mentions lions, cheetahs, and leopards are generally shy and better seen with binoculars, it specifically states giraffes (jiraaf) and elephants are likely to be seen *near* the vehicles during a safari.

Therefore, a tour participant is most likely to encounter giraffes during a vehicle safari based on the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi safar ki kam tar qimat kiya hogee?","The correct answer is **B: Chaar logon ki eek jamaat ko talaash karna** (Searching for a group of four people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bary jamaaton keliye seyahati safar kafayati hota hay lehza agar aap sarf khud yaa eek dost key saath hain too, dosray logon say milnay kee koshish karein our fee sakhs kafayati sharah keliye chaar say chhah logon kaa group banayein.""  This translates to: ""Travel is cheaper for large groups, so if you are only going with yourself or a friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people for an affordable rate per person.""

Therefore, forming a group of four is specifically mentioned as a way to make the trip more affordable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Khud sey jaana** (Going alone) - The passage implies this is *less* affordable.
*   **C: Eek deegar shakhs key saath jaana** (Going with another person) - While better than going alone, the passage recommends finding more people.
*   **D: Chah yaa ziyadah ki eek jamaat ko talaash karnaa** (Searching for a group of seven or more) - While a larger group *could* be cheaper, the passage specifically recommends aiming for 4-6 people."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Mumkanah tor parr behtareen safar key daurah ko kaun mahfooz karegaa?","The text suggests that traveling in groups of 4-6 people is most cost-effective. It also warns that tours often try to fill vehicles by convincing people they should pay more. Therefore, the safest and most cost-effective way to travel, according to the text, is to form a group.

The best answer is **D: Paanch logon ki eek jamaat (A group of five people)**. 

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly recommends groups of 4-6 for affordability.
*   Five falls within that range.
*   The other options are less ideal:
    *   A: Focuses on a negative tactic (shuffling cars)
    *   B: Three people is less optimal than 4-6.
    *   C: Two people doesn't leverage the group discount suggested.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, San Francisco ki aalami shanakht mein kiss cheez ney taawun kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Fan aur media ki mukhtalif shaklon mein aksar mojudgi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: *""iss kee mausiqi, film, adab our awami culture mean matwatar tasveer kashee say yeah shehar our iss key mualim saree duniya mean maruf how gaye.""* (Its music, film, literature and popular culture through frequent depictions have made this city and its landmarks famous all over the world.)

This directly indicates that San Francisco's global recognition is due to its frequent presence in various forms of art and media.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aalaa nishaan waley convention ki sahuliyaat** (High-profile convention facilities) - While San Francisco has these, the passage says they *support* the tourism economy, but don't directly contribute to its global *recognition*.
*   **C: Eqtesaadi tanawwo** (Economic diversity) - The passage mentions economic diversity as a characteristic of the city, but not as the reason for its global fame.
*   **D: Eek oper aur aaney waley ashiayi khaney ka manzar** (A thriving and coming culinary scene) - The passage mentions good food options, but focuses on San Francisco being *among* the best for various cuisines, not that the food itself is what made it globally known.



"
Ebarat key hisaab sey San Francisco key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Eqtesaad ka puri tarah seyahat parr bharosah bharosa hay** (The economy completely relies on tourism).

Here's why:

The passage states that San Francisco's economy is *linked* to tourism, but also explicitly says it is *diverse* (matnua). It lists several major employment sectors *besides* tourism: financial services, government, finance, business, and tech.  Therefore, the economy is *not* completely reliant on tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

* **A: Isko aksar filmon aur kitabon mein nomayan kiya gaya hay** (It is often depicted in films and books) - The text says its music, film, literature, and popular culture have made the city and its landmarks famous worldwide.
* **B: Asiayi khana morawwajah hay** (Asian food is popular) - The passage mentions it as one of the best places for Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese cuisine.
* **C: Hotel aur convention key bahut sey maraakiz** (Many hotels and convention centers) - The text specifically states San Francisco has established a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and high-quality convention facilities.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism key mosaafir ko safar key agent ki khidmaat ka istemaal karney sey fayedah honaa mumkin nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek mosaafir jo booking safah key saudon ko tarjeeh detaa hay (A traveler who prefers the convenience of booking platforms)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kisee bhee tarmimaat yaa darkhwaston co travel agent kee maarifat arsaal kiya jaye, nah kahh braah raast hotel co."" (Any amendments or requests should be sent *through* the travel agent, not directly to the hotel).  This implies someone who *prefers* to deal directly with booking platforms (and thus make changes themselves) wouldn't benefit from a travel agent.  They'd find the agent an unnecessary middleman.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek gair faisalah kun mosaafir (An indecisive traveler):**  Travel agents can *help* indecisive travelers by presenting options and making recommendations.
* **B: Besaakhtagi ka shikaar eek mosaafir (A traveler suffering from inflexibility):** The passage describes travel agents handling arrangements like transportation and meals, suggesting they *provide* flexibility.
* **C: Eek mosaafir jisney abhi apna visa mahfooz nahein kiya hay (A traveler who hasn't yet secured their visa):** The passage states agents can *help* with documents like visas.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko ebarat mein safari agent key zariyah booking key fayedah key tor par zikr naein kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tezz safar key dastavezaat (Fast travel documents)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions these benefits of using a travel agent:

*   **Hotel key saudey (Hotel deals):** ""Travel agents key paas aksar makhsus hotels kee deals yaa paishkashen hoti hain...""
*   **Tamaam jamaa package (Complete packages):** ""...aise pekach aafar kartay hain ju nashta, air port say jaaney aaney key liye naql wo hamal key intezamat yaa mushtarkah tor purr hotel our jehaaz key bhee pekaj hotay hain.""
*   **Eek reservation ka haamil honaa (Having a reservation):** ""...wah log aap kaa reservation bhee rock saktay hain."" and ""...kisee bhee tarmimaat yaa darkhwaston co travel agent kee maarifat arsaal kiya jaye""

However, the passage **does not** mention travel agents helping with *speeding up* travel documents (like visas). It only says they can help *consider* documents like visas and can make reservations related to them, but not that they make the process faster.

Therefore, **A** is the correct answer.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Haqiqi waqt key matan key motarjim ki darkhawastein kiss cheez key qaabil nahein hein?","The correct answer is **D: Waqt ka 100% durust tor parr tarjumaa karnaa (Translating 100% accurately in real-time)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Translation anjanon mean dramayi tor say behtari aayi hay our abb wah cum wo baish darsat tarjumah day rahay hain (our gich pitch naadir hay), leakin phir bhee ehtiyaat laazim hay kiyon kahh wah abb bhee saare kaa saara ghalat kirr saktay hain.""  This translates to ""Translation has improved dramatically in recent years and is now around 80% accurate (and glitches are rare), but caution is still needed because they can still make completely wrong translations.""

This directly indicates that real-time text translators are *not* capable of 100% accurate translation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bairuni zubaano mein alamaat ka tarjumah karnaa (Translating signs in foreign languages):** The passage states these apps *can* translate signs using your phone's camera.
*   **B: Matan key mokammal tabqaat ka tarjumaa karnaa (Translating complete segments of text):** The passage says they are capable of translating ""entire segments of text.""
*   **C: Smartphone key zariyah smaano parr matan ka tarjumaa karnaa (Translating text on objects via smartphone):** The passage explains this functionality - pointing your phone at objects.



"
Offline tarjumey karney ki kiss cheez sey ijazat milti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Zubaan key data ko download karnaa** (Downloading the language data).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ju matlubah zubaan kaa deta down load karnay key baad iskaa off line tarjumah kirr deta hay"" - ""...which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Behtar kardah arjumaa key engin (Improved translation engine):** While a good engine is *necessary*, it doesn't *allow* offline translation. It's the data that makes it possible.
* **B: Smartphone:** A smartphone is the *device* used, but doesn't provide the ability for offline translation itself.
* **D: Haqiqi waqt key tarjumaa key zumrey mein darkhawastein (Requests in the real-time translation category):** This is a general description of the app type, not what enables offline functionality.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon barfaani todey kaa moharrik nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Chaspaan baraf (Packed snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that packed snow *needs* a jolt to start falling, and can *cause* more snow to fall. It doesn't *initiate* the avalanche itself.  It's a condition that makes avalanches possible, not a trigger.

The passage explicitly lists the following as triggers:

*   **Insaan (Humans):** ""Aksar koyee insaan"" - Often a human.
*   **Dhoop (Sun):** ""Baaz auqaat asl moharrik waaqiah barf co garma denay waala sooraj hota hay"" - Sometimes the main driver is the sun warming the snow.
*   **Ezaafi baraf baari (Excessive snowfall):** ""Kabhi kabhi kachh ziyadah barf baari hoti hay"" - Sometimes there's excessive snowfall.

Therefore, packed snow is a *condition* contributing to avalanches, not a *cause* or trigger."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon barfaani todey ki tarah neechey aata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Chaspaan baraf jo tahrik shudah nahein hay (Packed snow that hasn't been disturbed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mushkil yeah hay kahh barf chapki hoyee hay, iss liye iss co neechey giranay key liye kachh jhatka laganay kee zaroorat hay...""  This translates to ""The difficulty is that the snow is packed, so it needs some shock to fall down...""

This directly describes packed (chaspaan) snow that hasn't been moved (tahrik shudah nahein) needing a trigger to release and fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Begair baraf key khadi dhalwaanein (Slopes without snow)** - The passage is *about* snow falling, not slopes without it.
* **C: Khadi dhalwaano parr ziyadah baraf ka hajam (Large volume of snow on slopes)** -  While the passage mentions large amounts of snow, it's focusing on how *packed* snow falls, not just the volume.
* **D: Insaano ney baraf ko achoot chod diya (Humans left the snow untouched)** - The passage mentions humans as *sometimes* being a trigger for avalanches, but doesn’t state that untouched snow falls.  In fact, it implies packed, undisturbed snow needs *intervention* to fall.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, saalan kon sey ajzaa key ird gird mabni hay?","The correct answer is **B: jadee booti aur masalah (herbs and spices)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Curry masala our nabatat key saath gosht yaa sabzi say banayi jaaney waali eek dish hay."" This directly translates to ""Curry is a dish made with spices and herbs with meat or vegetables."" The passage then goes on to describe variations in *liquid* ingredients (yogurt or coconut milk) but the core of the dish is built around the masala (spice blend) and herbs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dahee aur paani (Yogurt and water):** While yogurt is mentioned as an ingredient in some regions, it's not the *foundation* of the dish.
*   **C: Nariyal ka dhoodh aur gosht (Coconut milk and meat):** These are ingredients used in *specific regions*, not the overall basis.
*   **D: Sabziyaan aur doodh (Vegetables and milk):**  Milk isn't mentioned in the passage, and while vegetables are used, they aren't the central component defining the dish.



"
"Makhsus khitton mein, nariyal ka doodh baaz auqaat eek mulk mein kiss juzw ki jagah istemaal hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Dahee**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shumali hind our pakistan key androni elaqon mean dahi co omuman kadhi mean istemaal kiya jaataa hay; jonubi hind our barsaghir key deegar saheli elaqon mean omuman narial kaa doodh istemaal kiya jaataa hay.""

This translates to: ""In North India and inland areas of Pakistan, yogurt (dahi) is commonly used in curry; in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.""

This directly indicates that coconut milk is often used *in place of* yogurt (dahi) in certain regions.



"
Transantarctic pahaadon key gardo nawah mein eek ghumao kiya hota hay jisey plateau key andar janey ki dar kaar hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: McMurdo Station aksar band rahta hay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...chunancha trial co plato purr aaney key liye trans interact mountain key ird gird taweel chakkar lagana padta hay."" (Therefore, to reach the plateau, one has to take a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains).  This detour is *because* McMurdo Station (the starting point near the Ross Sea) is often closed, forcing travelers to find an alternative route *through* the mountains rather than a direct path *to* the plateau.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: compact baraf khatarnaak hota hay (Compact snow is dangerous):** While compact snow might be dangerous, the passage doesn't mention this as the reason for the detour.
* **C: Makhsus tractor furteeley hotey hein (Special tractors are agile):** The passage actually states the opposite – ""Yeah sub bahut phurtele nahein hain"" (These are not very agile).
* **D: Ross Sea key zariyah safar karney sey yehh ziyaadah aasan hay (Traveling via the Ross Sea makes it easier):** The passage implies it's *more difficult* due to the need to detour.



"
"Jonubi Pole Traverse key kinaarey, kiss cheez ko jhandon sey nishaan zadd kiya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Baraf sey pack shagaafein (Crevasses in the ice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""iss key those barf mean gadhay karkay nishan key tor purr jhanday lagaa diay jaatay hain"" which translates to ""flags are placed along it to mark the buried crevasses in the ice."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo Station ki pagdandi (The path to McMurdo Station):** The passage mentions McMurdo Station as the starting point, but the flags aren't marking *the path to* it, they're marking something *on* the route.
* **B: Tel ley jaaney waley tractor (Tractors carrying fuel):** The tractors use the road, they aren't what's being marked.
* **D: Pahaadon key gardo nawah mein khatarnaak moad (Dangerous turns in the mountains):** While the route avoids mountains, the flags are specifically for marking dangers *in the ice*, not mountain turns.



"
Ebarat mein kiya iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh kiss cheez sey Jonubi Africa ki daryaaft kartey waqt sayyahon ko aagah rahnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Mukhtalif mamalik mein Visas key liye motanawwah zaruriyaat hoti hein** (Different countries have varying requirements for visas).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Veza key taqazay our ikhrajat qaum darr qaum mukhtalif hain our aap key rehaishi mulk key lehaaz say asrandaz ho saktay hain."" (Visa requirements and expenses vary from country to country and may depend on your country of residence).  This directly addresses the need for travellers to be aware of visa needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage *mentions* rough roads and the benefit of a 4x4, it doesn’t say travellers *should be aware* of this as a necessary precaution. It's more about making the trip possible.
* **C:** The passage explicitly states the opposite: ""tahim eek 4x4 kee shaded salah dye jaati hay our bhat say maqamat 4x4 key bees waale pahiyon key saath hee qaabil rasayi how saktay hain."" (However, a 4x4 is recommended and many locations are only accessible with a four-wheel drive.) The passage states ""bhalay hee janubi afriqah mean istehkaam ho leakin tamaam padosi mamalik mean istehkaam kaa maahul nahein hay."" (although South Africa is stable, the neighbouring countries are not.)
* **D:** This is *recommended* but not something travellers *need to be aware of* - the passage suggests it, but doesn't frame it as a critical piece of information.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, car sey jonubi Africa ko daryaaft karney ko dekh rahey sayyahon key liye kisko bura mashwarah samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Agarcheh 4x4 ki sifarish ki jaati ho, ziyadah tar mahallaate waqoo eek aam gaadi key saath qaabile rasaayi hay.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tahim eek 4x4 kee shaded salah dye jaati hay our bhat say maqamat 4x4 key bees waale pahiyon key saath hee qaabil rasayi how saktay hain."" (However, a 4x4 is recommended, and many locations can only be reached with a 4x4 vehicle). 

Option B directly contradicts this by saying most areas *are* accessible with a standard car. This misleads tourists into thinking they don't need a 4x4 when the passage clearly states many locations *require* one.  The passage recommends 4x4 *specifically* because some areas aren't reachable otherwise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage *supports* the idea of needing specific emergency items due to local laws (""Harr mulk key kuchh munfarid qawanin bhee hotay hain ju taqazah kartay hain kahh gaadi mean konsi hungami cheezein rakhnay kee zaroorat hay"").
* **C:** The passage encourages exploring beyond typical routes (""Jonubi afriqah mean kaar say daakhil honaa uss khitah kee zeebai kaa dedaar karnay key liye neez inn maqamat thak pahunchnay mean hairatnaak hay ju tourist root say pray hain"").
* **D:**  The passage warns about instability in neighboring countries, making it a valid point, not bad advice.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon ebarat mein iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh aapkey bagon ko chodney ka mumkanah khatrah ko nazar andaaz kar diya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Aap anjaaney mein manshiyaat ley jaaney waley ban saktey hein (You could unknowingly become a drug mule)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tum paao gay kahh tumhare ilm key baghair tum co drigg career qaraar day diyaa gayaa hay"" which translates to ""You might find that you have been made a drug carrier without your knowledge."" This directly addresses the risk of unknowingly transporting drugs in your luggage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ho sakta hay unki chori ho gayi ho (They might get stolen):** The passage *does* mention theft (""Lawaris bags choron key nishanay purr hotay hain"" - Unclaimed bags are targets for thieves), but it's framed as a general risk, not a disregard for the possibility.
* **C: Wohh kisi aur sey shak mein padd saktey hein (They might fall under suspicion from someone else):**  While possible, the passage doesn't focus on suspicion from others, but rather on the *actual* risks of carrying something illicit or being targeted.
* **D: Ho sakta hay kehh zimmah daar unhein eek mumkanah bam key khartah key tor parr dekhtey hon (Officials might see them as a potential bomb threat):** The passage *does* mention bomb threats (""bom key khatraat say choknehkam kee uss taraf nigaah padsakti hay""), but it's a consequence of security checks, not a disregard for the possibility of your bag being perceived as a threat.



Therefore, option B is the only one directly tied to a specific danger mentioned in the passage—the possibility of unknowingly becoming involved in drug trafficking."
Manshiyaat ley jaaney key talluq sey ebarat mein kiyaa mazkoor nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Notice key begair manshiyaat soonghney waley kutton ka istemaal kiya jaa sakta hay** (Notice without drugs sniffing dogs can be used).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""iss mean waiting line bhee hoti hay, iss liye kahh baghair kisee ettelaa key soonghne waale kutton kaa kisee bhee waqat istemaal kiya jasakta hay.""  This directly translates to ""This also includes waiting lines, therefore drug-sniffing dogs can be used at any time without notice.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baaz mamalik mein pahli baar mujrimeen ko maut ki saza dee jaye gee** (Some countries will give the death penalty to first-time offenders) - The passage says *some countries have* very harsh punishments, including the death penalty, but doesn't say they *will* be given.
* **B: Aalami safar kartey waqt ezaafi ehteyaat karnaa chahiye** (Extra precautions should be taken while traveling internationally) - While the passage *implies* this by warning about bag checks, it doesn't directly state it. It focuses on keeping an eye on your bags.
* **D: Zimmah daar aapkey bagon ko zabt kar saktey hein agarcheh aap manshiyaat na ley jaa rahey hon** (Authorities can confiscate your bags even if you are not carrying drugs) - The passage says you might find items in your bag you weren't aware of, leading to trouble, but doesn't say authorities will confiscate bags *even without drugs*.



"
Kiss qism key mashroob ko iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay kehh qiyaam key doraan ghar parr koyi cheez bananey ki koshish karna hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Beer**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **Coffee (Kaafi)** for the morning (""Apnay ghar mein subah co eek bharpur kaafi..."")
*   **Tea (Chaye)** for the evening (""...raat mean kuch pursokoon babunah chaye..."")
*   **Juice (Mashroob)** as something you might easily make to incorporate back into your routine (""Shayed aap koyee aasaan mashrub driyafat karein gay ju aap apnay roz marah key mamool mean waps aakar asay nashta banasakte hain."")

Beer is mentioned in the context of visiting bars/pubs *outside* the home (""Agar aap eek mukhtalif qism key pinay kee tehzeeb waale shehar mean baste hain, to hamsaye mean aise baarz yaa pubs mean jayein jahaan aap matwatir nahein jaatay."") but is *not* suggested as something to make *at home* during a staycation.



"
Aap qeyaam key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiska daurah karnaa chahtey hein agar aapka shahar piney ki saqafat keliye mashhoor ho?,"The passage strongly suggests exploring places you don't usually go to during a staycation, and specifically mentions bars/pubs you *don't* frequent if your city has a drinking culture. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Sharaab khaaney jahaan aap aam tor parr ziyadha nahein jatey hein (Wine places where you don't usually go)**.

Here's why the other options are less fitting:

* **A: Aap key pados key baahar kafee ki dukaanein (Coffee shops outside your neighborhood):** While exploring is good, the passage leans towards trying something *different* than your usual routine, not just a different location for something you do regularly.
* **B: Juice yaa halkey samaano ki dukaanein (Juice or light goods stores):** This focuses on healthy options mentioned as a return to routine, not exploration.
* **D: Chamomile chaye bananey waley resturaan (Chamomile tea making restaurants):** This refers to a relaxing evening activity *at home*, not going out to explore.



"
Faakhtah key mojassamey kahaan waqea hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Church key sahan mein** (In the church courtyard).

The passage states: ""Cleasa key sahan mean kachh maqbaron purr sing marmar say banay fakhtaon dilchasp mujasme hain."" which translates to ""In Cleasa's courtyard, interesting statues made of white marble are found among some tombs.""

Therefore, the statues are located in the church courtyard."
Kis qism key visa ko kaafi maliyaati taawun ka soboot faraham karney key liye kisi shakhs ki darkaar hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Talabah ka visa (Student Visa)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ziyadah ther mamalik mean jahaan aap taleem haasil karnaa chahte hain vahan key idaarey say aafar later our cum say cum khud keliye pehle taleemi saal key ikhrajat key waastay fund key sabut kee zaroorat hogi.""  This translates to: ""In most countries where you want to study, the institutions will require proof of funds for your tuition fees and living expenses for the first academic year.""

This clearly indicates that a student visa requires proof of financial support.  The passage doesn't mention financial proof requirements for business or tourist visas, only that student visas do.
"
Bahut ziyadah mumkanah tor parr tausee shudah visa ki kisko darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek aalami talabah (An international student)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*leakin eek been alaqwami talib alam kee haisiyat say vahan jaaney key liye aam tor purr vahan mahaz eek tafrihi seyaah key bator jaaney say kahein ziyadah taweel qayaam kee zaroorat hoti hay.*"" (But as an international student going there requires a longer stay than just going there as a recreational tourist.)

It also mentions specific requirements for students, like proof of funds for the first year of study.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek baqaedah sayyah (A regular tourist):** The passage states tourists don't *need* extended visas for short trips.
*   **B: Eek season walaa mosaafir (A seasonal traveler):** This isn't specifically addressed in the passage.
*   **D: Eek karobari mosaafir (A business traveler):** The passage mentions business travelers needing visas, but doesn't specify they need *extended* visas as a rule.



"
Machcharon ki aapko khaas tor parr kabb yaad aani chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Barish key jangalaat mein (In rainy jungles)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states you need to be careful about mosquitoes *if* you decide to cycle through dense jungles, *especially* if passing through a subtropical rainforest. It highlights the risk of them entering with you when you open doors even for a few seconds.  This directly connects mosquito awareness to rainy jungles.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mosame garma key mahino key doraan (During summer months):** While mosquitoes are more prevalent in summer, the passage focuses on a specific environment, not just the season.
*   **B: Paidal safar parr (On foot travel):** The passage specifically mentions *cycling* through the jungle.
*   **D: Chalatey waqt (While driving/moving):**  The passage is about entering a space (the jungle), not just the act of moving.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, barish key jangal mein drve kartey waqt machcharon sey bachney key liye kiya karney sey aapko ruknaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Bahut der tak gaadi key darwazon ko khula chodna** (Leaving the car doors open for a long time).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that even opening the door for a *few seconds* in a subtropical rainforest is enough time for mosquitoes to enter the car.  Therefore, leaving the doors open for a *long* time would significantly increase the risk of mosquitoes getting in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mosame garma key doraan drive karnaa** (Driving during the hot season) - The passage mentions the hot season as a time when mosquitoes are present, but doesn't suggest avoiding driving then.
* **C: Zaili tropical elaaqon mein drive karnaa** (Driving in subtropical regions) -  The passage points out this *is* where mosquitoes are a problem, but doesn’t suggest avoiding these areas.  It focuses on how to deal with them *if* you're there.
* **D: Paidal safar key doraan gaadi ko nazar andaaz chod dena** (Ignoring the car during a walking trip) - The passage talks about driving, not walking.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Sundarbans key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Iskey kul elaqah mein sey aadha daldal mein fansa hua hay** (Approximately half of its total area is submerged in marshland).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sundarban 3,850 km2 elaqay kaa ahatah karta hay, jis mean eek tahayi paani/dildali elaqay hain."" (Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is water/marshland).
* **One-third is not half.** Therefore, the statement that half the area is marshland is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **A: Yehh bahut kam bach jaaney waley taqatwar janglon mein sey kuchh ko nomayan karta hay** (It represents some of the very few remaining powerful forests) - The text says ""unn mean azeem janglaat kee aakhri baaqi kuch patiyan shaamil hain jis nay eek baar gangetic maidan kaa ahatah kiya huwa thaa"" (includes the last remaining leaves of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plains).
* **C: Yehh duniya ka sabsey bada mangrove belt hay** (It is the largest mangrove belt in the world) - The first sentence clearly states this.
* **D: Yehh bengal key tigaron sey ziyadah chitkabrey hirano ka ghar hay** (It is home to more spotted deer than Bengal tigers) - The passage states ""abb 400 bengali cheetay our 30,000 key qareeb chitkabray hirran mojud hain"" (approximately 400 Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer are found in this area).  30,000 is much larger than 400.



"
Jangal ka konsa hissah Hindusani elaqah mein padta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans ka qomi Park** (Sundarbans National Park).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""bhaarti elaqay mean mojud jungle kaa hissah sundarban national park kahalata hay."" (The portion of the jungle located in the Indian region is called Sundarbans National Park.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jangali zindagi ki panah gaah (Wildlife Sanctuary):** While Sundarbans *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the passage specifically states the *part* in the Indian region is the National Park.
*   **C: Duniya ki morusi site (World Heritage Site):** The entire Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but this doesn't specify the Indian portion.
*   **D: Ganga key plain (Ganga's plain):** The passage mentions the forest once covered the Gangetic plain, but doesn't say the Indian part *is* the plain.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiskey paas bahut mumkanah tor parr angrezi zubaan ki kam az kam mahdud samajh hay?","The correct answer is **B: Kam umar key log (Younger people)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...*aap toqaa kirr saktay hain kahh hattayi kahh iss say ziyadah key paas mahdud ilm hota hay, khaas tor purr chhoti umar key log.*""  This translates to ""...you can imagine that many have limited knowledge of it, especially younger people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kam az kam do deegar zubanein bolney waley log (People who speak at least two other languages):** The passage doesn't specifically link multilingualism to limited English understanding.
*   **C: Toronto ka safar karney waley log (People traveling to Toronto):** The passage uses Toronto as a setting, but doesn't state that visitors have limited English comprehension.
*   **D: Ziyadah umar key log (Older people):** The text directly points to younger people as having limited knowledge.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiska talaffuz karnaa mushkil ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mumtaaz lahjon waley alfaaz (Excellent accents/dialects)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*yeah bilkhusus khatabat purr sadiq hay jinn kaa durust talaffuz aksar dushwaar hota hay.*""  This translates to ""…especially speeches/talk that are truthful, whose correct pronunciation is often difficult."" The passage is talking about how accents (and therefore, the way people *speak* words) can be hard to understand, not written words or local languages in general.  The context specifically points to the challenge of understanding different *accents* and dialects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Patey (Letters):** The passage explicitly states that written words are *more* understandable than spoken words.
*   **C: Likhey huey alfaaz (Written words):**  As above, written words are easier to understand.
*   **D: Maqami boli (Local languages):** While different languages can be challenging, the passage's emphasis is on the difficulty of understanding variations *within* a language (accents).

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, andrune zilaa station sey bus leney ka mansubah bananey waley kisi mosaafir key liey konsa manzar naamah nomunah ban sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Mosaafir Bumthang ki taraf aagey badh raha hey aur 7 tak usey chod kar jaaney ki zarurat hay**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""wah ju mashriq our jakar/bumthang kee taraf jaati hain wah 06:30 our 07:30 bajay key darmiyan rakhsat hoti hain."" (Buses going east towards Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30).
* Option B directly reflects this information – the traveler is going to Bumthang and needs to leave by 7:00.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't specify the traveler *already* has a ticket. It *recommends* buying one in advance.
* **C:** The passage mentions Paro taxis (and their price) but doesn't say anything about buses going to Paro and a departure time of 11:00.
* **D:** While ""purab"" (east) is mentioned, the passage doesn't specify a departure time as early as 6:20. It gives a window of 6:30-7:30.



"
Andarune zilaa bus station sey mashriq ki taraf safar karney ko dekhney waley kisi sayyah key liye kiya cheez eek achcha noktah ho sakta hay?,"The best answer is **B: Peshgi ticket kharidein (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Choon kahh azlaa key darmiyan chalnay waali basein aksar bhari hoti hain lehza behatar ho gaa chand dunn pesh ther ticket khareed lia jaye."" (Because the buses running between districts are often full, it is better to buy tickets a few days in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 8:30 key baad sirf basein rawanah hoti hein (Only buses depart after 8:30):**  The passage states buses to the east *leave* between 6:30 and 7:30.  It doesn't say they *only* leave after 8:30.  There are buses running all day.
* **C: Bahut see basein dinn bhar rawanah hoti hein (Many buses depart throughout the day):** This is true, but doesn't give advice to a traveler, it just states a fact. The question asks for a *good point* for a traveler.
* **D: Eek mushtarekah taxi mein safar key sabsey ziyadah smart wasayel ho saktey hein (A shared taxi might be the smartest way to travel):** While the passage mentions taxis are faster and more comfortable for shorter distances, it doesn't suggest they are the ""smartest way"" overall, and the question specifies travel *to the east*.



Therefore, the most relevant and helpful advice for a traveler is to **buy tickets in advance** due to the buses often being full."
Darjah zail mein sey kon Timbuktu ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yehh sayyarah sey na qaabile rasaayi hay** (It is inaccessible from the planet).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iss key banisbat naqabil rasayi purr mushtamil """"tumbto"""" kaa naam gher mulki, door daraaz elaqay key istearay key toor purr istemaal hota thaa.""  This translates to ""The name 'Timbuktu' was formerly used as a metaphor for a remote, inaccessible place.""  However, the passage *then* goes on to say it *now* has an airport and is a tourist destination.  So, it's *no longer* inaccessible.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ismein mulk key baaqi zubaano ki banisbat Arabi ka ziyadah asaro rosukh hay** (It has more influence of Arabic than other languages of the country) - The passage explicitly states this: ""Yeah shehar milk key baqiyah tamaam shehron say makmal tor purr mukhtalif hay, iss liye kahh iss mean afriqi key bajaye ziyadah ther arabi mezaaj zoq paya jaataa hay.""
* **B: Yehh gurbat zadah hay** (It is impoverished) - While not directly stated, the passage mentions being included on a list of ""world heritage sites threatened by desert sand"" implying economic and environmental vulnerability, often linked to poverty.
* **D: Ismein motajassis sayyahon key liye kashish baaqi hay** (It still holds attraction for inquisitive tourists) - The passage says it has a ""tourist appeal"" and is one of the important places seen during Henry Louis Gates' PBS African journey.



Therefore, **C** is the only statement that doesn't align with the information presented in the text."
Timbuktu key baarey mein konsi darjah zail haqeeqt sahee hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Ismein gardo nawah key shaharon ki banisbat kam tar Afriki zayeqah hay** (It has less African flavor compared to other desert cities).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeah shehar milk key baqiyah tamaam shehron say makmal tor purr mukhtalif hay, iss liye kahh iss mean afriqi key bajaye ziyadah ther arabi mezaaj zoq paya jaataa hay.""  This translates to ""This city is completely different from all other cities in the country, because instead of African, a more Arab taste is found here.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar sayyarah sey qaabile rasaayi hay** (The city is accessible by plane) - While the passage *mentions* Timbuktu has an airport, it doesn't state it's the defining characteristic or that it was previously inaccessible.
* **B: Yehh gareeb sey ziyadah gair mulkee hay** (It is more remote than poor) - The passage describes it as a ""nadaar elaqah"" (remote area), but doesn't focus on poverty as its primary characteristic.
* **D: Yehh shahar sayyahon key liye mazeed pur kashish nahein hay** (This city is not more attractive for tourists) - The passage says ""iss kee sakha asay eek seyahati dilkashi say bharpur elaqah banaati hay"" (its branches create a region full of travel attraction).  It implies it *is* becoming a tourist destination.



"
Mosame garma key Olympics ki asal mein kabb miqaat bandi ki gayee thee? ,"The correct answer is **D: Julayi 2020**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...*Olympic co mansukh karnay kaa faislah kiya gayaa thaa* (the Olympic committee made the decision to cancel) *July 2020 thak*.""  This means the decision to postpone (effectively cancel and reschedule) the games was made by July 2020.

While the games *took place* in August 2021 and ended September 2021, the original scheduling/cancellation decision happened in July 2020.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss noqtah chimney toofan ban jaati hay?","The correct answer is **D: Zameen ko chooney key baad (After touching the ground)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inn kee sharoaat toofani baadlon say nikalnay waale gaalon jaisi hoti hay leakin zameen co chhoote hee wah """"aandhi"""" bunn jaatay hain.""  This translates to: ""They start like funnels coming out of stormy clouds, but as soon as they touch the ground, they become a 'tornado'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jabb hawayein 100 meel fee ghantah key aas paas pahunchti hein (When the winds reach around 100 miles per hour):** While the passage mentions wind speeds, it doesn't say *that* is when it *becomes* a tornado, but rather a *characteristic* of a tornado.
*   **B: Hawa key kalamon ki jabb katayi ki jaa rahi ho (When the columns of air are being cut):** The passage doesn't describe air columns being ""cut"".
*   **C: Toofan key baadalon sey neechey utartey waqt (While descending from storm clouds):** The passage says it *starts* as a funnel from the clouds, but doesn't become a tornado until it reaches the ground.



"
Inmein sey kon toofan ki durust khosusiyat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh zameen chooney key baad wohh chimniyaan bann jaati hein** (They turn into chimneys after touching the ground).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes tornadoes (toofan) as becoming ""aandhi"" (storms/winds) after touching the ground, not chimneys.** This is a clear misrepresentation of what the passage says.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **A: Wohh hameshaa 100-200 meel fee ghantah key aas paas ki hawayein paida karti hein** (They always produce winds around 100-200 miles per hour) - The passage *states* winds are ""aksar 100 say 200 meal fee ghantah kee raftaar"" (often 100 to 200 miles per hour). While ""always"" is strong, it's closer to the description than option C.
* **B: Wohh akasar bhaari zarraat lekar chalti hein** (They often carry heavy particles) - The passage mentions they ""toofani aandhi bhaari ashyaa cow apnay saath adaa lay jaati hay"" (carry heavy objects with them).
* **D: Wohh baahar hawa ko dhakelney waley kalmon ki katayi kar rahey hein** (They are doing the cutting of pens that push outside air) – This describes the funnel shape and inward pull of air, which is accurately described in the passage: ""ju ard gird kee hawa co andar kee taraf our oper kee taraf khainchta hay"" (which pulls the surrounding air inwards and upwards).



Therefore, **C** is the only option that *contradicts* the information provided in the passage."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko apney manzil shahar mein kahaan sey seyaasi halat key baarey mein mashwarah haasil karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Khud apni hukumat sey (From their own government)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aap apni hukumat key elawah doosri hukumaton kaa mashurah bhee leena chaah saktay hain..."" (You can also take advice from other governments in addition to your own government...).  However, it *immediately* follows this with a warning that other governments' advice is geared towards *their* citizens, not necessarily yours.

While you *can* consult other governments, the passage implicitly prioritizes seeking information from **your own government** as the primary source.  The passage also mentions that governmental advice is a ""brief statement of a country's political situation,"" indicating it's a starting point, and you should likely supplement it, but *begin* with your own government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uss mulk ki hukumat sey jiska wohh dorah kar rahey hein (The government of the country they are visiting):** The passage doesn’t suggest directly asking the host country’s government for political situation advice.
*   **B: Safar ki advisory mein pesh kardah nazaron sey (From the views presented in the travel advisory):** The passage states advisories are general and simplified.
*   **C: Jis mulk ka wohh daurah kar rahey hein uskey shahriyon sey (From the citizens of the country they are visiting):**  This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Safar ki advisory key pasey manzar mein, khaarji shahriyon ko kiss cheez ka samnaa karna namumkin hay?","The correct answer is **D: Mulk ki seyaasi surate haal key baarey mein tafseeli malumaat** (Detailed information about the political situation of the country).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hukumati salah kisee mulk kee seyasi haalat kaa mahaz mukhtasir bayaniah hay. Pesh kiyey gaye khayalat aksarsarsari, omumi our bahut ziyadah saadah hain beh nisbat inn tafsili malumat key ju doosri jaghon purr milti hain."" (Government advice is just a brief statement of a country's political situation. The ideas presented are generally, common and very simplistic compared to the detailed information found elsewhere.)

This means that travelers will *not* be able to get detailed information about a country's political situation from travel advisories. The other options (impact on health insurance, cancellation insurance, and simplistic summaries) *are* things travelers might experience.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism key safar ko kisi safar key agent sey booking ka taawun haasil karna kam az kam mumkin hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek shahar mein kaam ki conference ka safar jiska mosaafir ney iss sey pahley daurah kiya ho (A trip to a city for a work conference that the traveler has visited before)**.

Here's why:

The passage states travel agents are most helpful when guiding travelers *beyond* their previous experience, particularly regarding natural scenery, culture, language, or income-generating countries.  A trip to a city *already* visited for a work conference doesn't fall into that category; the traveler already has experience with it.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Eek bahut hi khaas bajat mein do haftey ka safar (A two-week trip on a very specific budget):**  The passage says agents often specialize in budget limitations.
* **C: Eek safar jiss sey zubaan ki rukawat pesh aayegi (A trip where a language barrier will be encountered):**  Agents can help with trips involving language and cultural differences.
* **D: Eek mosafir ka bairune mulk ka pahla safar (A traveler's first trip abroad):** This is a prime example of needing guidance *beyond* prior experience, as mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss manzar naamah mein safari agent ki madad sey eek mosaafir ko sabsey ziyaadah faaedah haasil hota hay?","The correct answer is **B: Jabb mosaafir ko pahli baar khususi safar ko book karney mein dilchaspi ho** (When a traveler is interested in booking a special trip for the first time).

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents ""guide a traveler beyond their previous experience with regard to natural scenery, culture, language or income-generating countries.""  It also mentions agents often specialize in ""specific types of travel, budget limits or destination."" This strongly suggests a traveler benefits *most* from an agent when venturing into unfamiliar territory or planning a complex, specialized trip – like a first-time special journey.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A:** Booking round-trip flights is a standard transaction and doesn't necessarily require the expertise of a travel agent.
*   **C:** Knowing the local language is helpful, but doesn't necessitate an agent.
*   **D:** Familiarity with cultural differences would lessen the need for a travel agent's guidance.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, naye maqamaat ka daurah kartey waqt eek mosaafir ko mayoosi sey bachney mein kiya cheez madad kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Jahaan key hein ussi tarah key qanoon ko manana** (Following the laws of the place you are in).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...tor wo tareeqe, qawanin, khuraak, aamad wo raft, rehan sehan, mayaar, zubaan our asee tarah kee cheezein kasee hadd thak iss waqat say mukhtalif how nagay jib aap they.""  This means customs, **laws**, food, etiquette, standards, language, etc., will be *different* than what you're used to.  And it continues with ""...tham mayusi say our ghaliban mahalli logon key tor tareeqon purr nagwari say ijtanaab kro."" - avoid disappointment and negatively criticizing local customs.

Therefore, respecting and following the local laws is key to avoiding disappointment and frustration (mayusi) when traveling to a new place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh log jahaan sey hein usee tarah key meyaar ki tawaqqo karnaa** (Expecting the same standards as where you are from) - The passage *warns against* this! It emphasizes things *will* be different.
* **B: Eek gair maanus khaano ko aazmaaney ki chaahat** (A desire to try strange foods) - While being open-minded is good, the passage doesn't mention this as a way to *avoid* disappointment.
* **D: Qiyaam parr sabiqah tahqiq sey bachna** (Avoiding prior research on the place) - The passage doesn't suggest avoiding research, it suggests accepting that things will still be different than what you learn.



"
"Ebarat mein malumaat ki buniyaad parr, kis qism key shakhs ko kisi kharijee maqam ka safar kartey waqt mayusi ka saamna ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Band dimaagh shakhs (Close-minded person)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travelers should avoid criticism of local customs (""mahalli logon key tor tareeqon purr nagwari say ijtanaab kro"").  It emphasizes that things *will* be different from home – customs, laws, food, language, etc.  A close-minded person, someone unwilling to accept differences and stuck in their own ways, is the most likely to experience disappointment and frustration (mayusi) when faced with these differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gair mulki khanon ko pasand karney walaa shakhs (Someone who prefers foreign foods):**  This person might actually *enjoy* the experience of trying new things.
* **B: Tabdeeli parr pinapney walaa shakhs (Someone who embraces change):** This person is likely to adapt well and avoid mayusi.
* **D: Taleem sey lutf andoz honey walaa shakhs (Someone who is educated):**  Education doesn't inherently preclude someone from being open-minded, and could even foster it.



Therefore, a close-minded individual is most susceptible to mayusi when traveling to a foreign place because they are unlikely to accept or adapt to the differences they encounter."
Darjah zail mein sey kon pahli baar taraqqi pazeer mulk ka daurah karney waley mosaafiron key sifaarish kardah mashwarah hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Jabb aap pahley pahunchey to eek meyaari hotel mein sarmaya karein** (When you first arrive, invest in a standard hotel).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly recommends spending liberally on Western-style hotels, food, and services for the initial days to adjust. This is specifically suggested to avoid sleeping on the ground or being unprepared for local wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zameen parr sonay sey pahley maqami janwar ko janana** (Knowing the local animals before sleeping on the ground) - While knowing local animals is mentioned, it's in the context of *avoiding* sleeping on the ground altogether.
*   **B: Apney pahley chand dinon key doraan khana parr nomaaesh sey bachna** (Avoiding extravagance with food during the first few days) - The passage suggests the opposite - spending liberally on food.
*   **C: Agar baahar camp kana ho to eek plang yaa jhoola ki sifarish ki jaati hay** (A cot or hammock is recommended if camping) - This is advice for camping, but the initial focus is on *avoiding* the need to camp right away by staying in hotels.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya jaata hay kehh kisi cheez parr taraqqi pazeer mulk sey mowafiqat key waqt nomaesh karna hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Camp karney key liye toshak aur pad (Mattresses and bedding for camping)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions adapting to local customs in developed travel destinations, and suggests spending liberally on Western-style hotels, food, and services *initially* to ease the transition. It also advises bringing a cot or hammock for camping to avoid sleeping on the ground and potential dangers. 

However, it *doesn't* mention needing to compromise or adapt regarding mattresses or bedding when camping. It advises *bringing your own* for safety and comfort, rather than trying to adjust to local options.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the context of adaptation:

*   **A: Magribi andaaz ka khaana (Western-style food):**  The passage suggests spending freely on Western food in the beginning to help adjust.
*   **B: Meyaari khidmaat (Standard services):** Similar to food, standard services (like those found in Western hotels) are suggested for initial comfort.
*   **D: Meyaari hotel (Standard hotels):** The passage directly recommends spending on standard hotels to ease into the new culture.

"Darjah zail konsa ikhteyaar eek policy key haamil shakhs key liye behtareen hay jo apni policy ki eek majazi naqal hoti hay, lekin ho sakta hay kehh uss mein internet tak rasaayi na ho?","The best option for a policyholder needing a copy of their policy without relying on internet access is **C: Apney laptop ki memory mein store kardah eek naqal ko barqaraar rakhein (Maintain a copy stored in your laptop's memory)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Agar lap top yaa tablet key saath safar kirr rahay hain to, usky memory yaa disk (baghair internet qabil rasayi) kee eek kaapi store kirr lain."" (If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in its memory or disk (accessible without internet).)

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Eek safar key saathi ko eek naqal denaa (Giving a copy to a travel companion):** While helpful, it relies on *another person* having the copy, and isn't a direct solution for the policyholder's access.
* **B: Khud ko eek naqal email karnaa (Emailing a copy to yourself):** This requires internet access, which is the scenario being avoided.
* **D: “Cloud” mein eek naqal ko store karein (Storing a copy in the ""cloud""):**  This *also* requires internet access.



Therefore, **C** is the most directly recommended solution within the given text for having a copy available offline."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko policy parr dikhney ki zarurat nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Policy key haamil shakhs ka email patah** (The email address of the policy holder).

Here's why:

The text states you need to show the insurance company's email and international phone number for claims and power of attorney/authorization. It *doesn't* mention needing to show the policy holder's email address.  

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dawaa karney key liye aalami phone number** (International phone number for claims) - The text *explicitly* states this is required for claims.
* **B: Yaqeen dehindah ka email patah** (Insurance company's email address) -  The text *explicitly* states this is required for claims.
* **C: Ijazat dahi key liye aalami phone number** (International phone number for authorization) - The text *explicitly* states this is required for power of attorney/authorization.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa manfi size ziyadah tarr istemaal honey wali film ki wazaa ki akkaasi karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 milimeter manfi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""meyari 35 aim aim film (36 bayee 24 aim aim manfi) sub say aam hay"" which translates to ""Standard 35mm film (36 by 24mm negative) is the most common.""

While the text *mentions* 6x6cm and 56x56mm negatives, it clearly identifies 36x24mm as the *most common* size.



"
Darjah zail film ki wazaoon mein sey kon aisi qaraar daad ki peshkash karta hay jo DSLR key momaasil hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Darmiyaani wazaa ki film (Medium format film)**.

Here's why:

The text states that medium format film (6x6 cm, typically using 56x56mm negatives) provides approximately *four times* the resolution of 35mm film.  This higher resolution is comparable to that offered by DSLR cameras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 35 milimeter ki film (35mm film):** The text explicitly states this has *less* resolution than medium format, and doesn't match DSLR resolution.
*   **C: 56 x 56 milimeter ki film (56x56mm film):** This *is* a size of medium format film, but the question asks what *type* of film offers DSLR-like resolution.
*   **D: 6 x 6 centimeter ki film (6x6 cm film):**  Similar to C, this *is* a format within medium format, but isn't the answer to the question about resolution equivalence.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon karobaar ko likhney walaa eek safar shuru karney key silsiley mein aakhiri qadam hogaa?","The correct answer is **C: Apni niji website tameer karein (Build your own website)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jib aap web purr formatting our editing key aadi hojayein too phir baad mean aap apni web saait khud banaa saktay hain.""  This directly translates to ""Once you become proficient in formatting and editing on the web, then later you can build your own website.""  

This indicates building your own website is the *final* step *after* gaining skills on existing platforms (like a well-established travel blog).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Web ki wazaa kaari ki mashq karein (Practice web crafting)** - This is a step *leading up* to building a website, not the final step.
*   **B: Qabiley shuhrat safar key blog key liye motaddid mazaamin likhein (Write numerous articles for a famous travel blog)** - This is an initial step to *gain* skills and experience, not the final one.
*   **D: Apni tadween kaari ki maharaton ko nikharein (Hone your writing skills)** -  Like option B, this is about developing skills needed *before* the final step.

"Karobaar likhney waley eek safar shuru kartey waqt, darjah zail konsi salahiyat mumkanah tor parr sabsey pahley nikhaara janaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Blog likhnaa (Blog writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Safri tehreer likhnay kee tajarat sharoo karnay kaa aasaan tariqah yeah hay kahh kasee mustahkam travel blog web saait purr apni salahiyaton cow nikharein."" (The easiest way to start a travel writing business is to showcase your skills on a strong travel blog website.)

This directly indicates that the *first* skill to hone is writing travel blogs.  You need content (blogs) before you can effectively showcase yourself.  

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *first* skill:

*   **B: Web wazaa karnaa (Web designing)** - While useful eventually, you can start with an existing platform and learn web design *after* you're comfortable with the content.
*   **C: Tadween karnaa (Editing)** - Editing is important, but you need something to edit *first* - the blog posts!
*   **D: Website banana (Website building)** -  The passage says you can build your own website *later* once you're comfortable with formatting and editing - which comes after writing the blog posts.



"
Kiss qism key mosam mein aanton waley masayel paye jaatey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Garam aabo hawa (Hot and humid weather)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Garam ab woo hawa our jism key baahir donon hee jighon mean bacteria ziyadah teezi say phailta hay our ziyadah arse thak zindah rehta hay..."" (Hot and humid weather causes bacteria to spread more quickly and survive longer...).  It then links this to digestive issues (""aanton waley masayel"") by analogy to breathing problems in cold air.

Therefore, the passage directly identifies hot and humid weather as being associated with digestive problems.



"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, baqaedah beneqaabi kis cheez ki quwwate modafeat ka sabab ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Maqami jaraseem (Local germs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ghar mean elaqayi jaraseem key saath muslisil raabtay kee wajah say mashkalaat ziyadah hain jinn say aap pehle madafat key qaabil hain.""  This translates to: ""Problems are more prevalent due to continuous contact with local germs in the home than you were previously susceptible to.""

The passage directly links increased susceptibility to problems with contact with *local germs*.  The rest of the passage elaborates on how warm, humid environments facilitate the spread of bacteria (and thus problems related to germs).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aanton key masayel (Intestinal problems):** While the passage mentions issues like ""Delhi belly,"" these are *results* of germs, not the cause of increased susceptibility.
* **C: Saans key masayel (Breathing problems):** The passage mentions breathing problems relating to cold air, but not as a cause of increased susceptibility to problems overall.
* **D: Dilli ka pet (Delhi belly):**  This is a specific illness mentioned as an example, not a fundamental cause of increased vulnerability.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Schengen mintaqah key andar safar kaa faayedah hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaseer visa darkhawaston sey bachnaa (Avoiding numerous visa applications)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Asee tarah, eek shingan wezay kaa haamil honey say aap cow harr shingan rakan milk key wezay key liye alaihdah alaihdah darkhwast deenay kee zaroorat nahein..."" (Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply separately for visas for each Schengen member country...). This directly points to avoiding multiple visa applications as a key benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Paisa bachanaa (Saving money):** While saving on visa costs is *a* benefit, the text highlights avoiding the *process* of multiple applications as the primary advantage.
*   **C: Kaseer passport control key checkpoint sey bachnaa (Avoiding numerous passport control checkpoints):** The text *does* mention reduced passport control, but it's presented as a consequence of the Schengen area, not the main benefit.
*   **D: Koyi passport ki zarurat nahein hay (No passport is required):**  This is incorrect. The text states you still need a passport (""pissport""), just fewer visa requests.



"
Tutankhamun key maqbarah mein kiya cheez abb aur nahein payi jaa sakti?,"The correct answer is **D: Daulatein (Treasures)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Maqbaray kee mashhuri zamana qeemati ashyaa mazeed iss mean mojud nahein, balkah inhein qahirah key masri ajayeb khaaney mean muntaqil kirr diyaa gayaa hay.""  This translates to: ""The fame of the tomb no longer contains valuable things, rather they have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchh aaraesh (Some adornments):** The passage states the tomb has *limited* decoration, but doesn't say it's completely gone.
*   **B: Maan ka sarr (Head of the mummy):** The passage mentions the head *is* visible.
*   **C: Maan key kandhey (Shoulders of the mummy):** The passage mentions the shoulders *are* visible.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Vancouver ki konsi manzil qimat sey bedaar mosaafiron keliye kam az kam jaazib hogee? ","The correct answer is **C: Bowen jazeerah**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wahsalar (ju woo yankovar say 1.5ghantay key drive purr hay) kharchila hay leakin 2010 key sarmayi olympic kee wajah say khoob maruf hay.""  This translates to ""Whistler (which is a 1.5-hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive but became well-known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.""

The passage also mentions Bowen Island as a charming escape accessible by ferry from downtown Vancouver and describes it as a ""genuine community"" with various activities. There's no mention of price specifically for Bowen Island, but implicitly, it's presented as a more accessible option *compared* to the explicitly expensive Whistler.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Granville jazeerah (Granville Island):** The passage only says it's where the ferries to Bowen Island depart, not that it's affordable.
*   **B: Samundar sey aasman tak ki rahdari (Sea to Sky Highway):** This is the route to Whistler, which is stated to be *expensive*.
*   **D: Seeti bajaney walaa (Whistler):** The passage explicitly calls Whistler ""kharchila"" (expensive).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi manzil bahut mumkanah tor parr mosaafiron ko eek tausiqi Vancouver tajrabah ki peshkash karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen jazeerah**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes Bowen Island (Bowen jazirah) as:

*   A popular destination for kayaking, hiking, shopping, restaurants, and a relaxing getaway.
*   Having a ""genuine community feel"".
*   Being accessible by ferry from Vancouver.
*   Offering beautiful sunsets.

The passage highlights its unique appeal and positions it as a place for an authentic Vancouver experience. The other options aren't central to the description:

*   **Seeti bajaney walaa** (Whistler) is mentioned but described as expensive and primarily known for skiing.
*   **Vancouver shahar ka nichlaa hissah** (Downtown Vancouver) is simply a starting point to reach Bowen Island.
*   **Granville jazeerah** (Granville Island) is the origin of the ferries *to* Bowen Island, not the destination itself.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar mosaafir bila rok tok waley manazir haasil kar rahey hein to unhein kabb Falls ka daurah karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Jabb paani ki miqdaar oonchi ho** (When the water level is high).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baarish key mausam (nomber say march) mean paani kee satah buland hogi our aabshaar bhee bhat dramayi hone gay."" (During the rainy season - November to March - the water level will be high and the waterfall will be even more dramatic.)

The question asks when to visit for *uninterrupted views* (implied by ""bila rok tok waley manazir"").  While high water can obscure the full falls, the text emphasizes that it’s *more dramatic* during this time.  The text also says you *will* get wet, implying the best (most immersive) experience is during peak flow.

Let’s look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: March key zariyah novambar:** This is a time *range*, but doesn't specifically address the best views.
*   **B: Seyahat waley season key doraan:**  The text doesn't say the travel season guarantees the best views.
*   **D: barish waley season key baahar:** The text implies the falls are *less* dramatic outside the rainy season.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, navambar aur march key darmiyaan Victoria Falls ka daurah karney ka ultaa kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Falls key daramayi manazir (Dramatic views of the Falls)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baarish key mausam (nomber say march) mean paani kee satah buland hogi our aabshaar bhee bhat dramayi hone gay."" (During the rainy season - November to March - the water level will be high and the waterfall will be *very dramatic*.) 

Therefore, visiting during November to March means you'll experience the most dramatic views of Victoria Falls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Falls key gair wazeh manazir (Obscure views of the Falls):** While the passage mentions the falls can be obscured by mist (""atnaa paani hay kahh asl aabshaar kaa nazrah tumhari aankh say aujhal how jaataa hay""), the primary description of this period is of heightened drama, not obscurity.
*   **B: Chand sayyaah (Some tourists):** The passage doesn't focus on the number of tourists.
*   **D: Barish waley season sey bachna (Avoiding the rainy season):** The passage describes the benefits *of* visiting during the rainy season, not avoiding it.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiski film key liye drone istemaal kartey waqt sifaarish ki jaati hay?","The correct answer is **C: Ijazaton ki tahqiq karnaa (Investigating permissions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap drone istemaal kartay hain too pehle hee achhi tarah jaanch kirr lain kahh aap cow kunn cheezon kee film bananay kee ajazat hay our kunn ajazat naamon...""  This translates to: ""If you use a drone, first thoroughly investigate what things you are allowed to film and what things are not allowed...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peshgi yehh padtaal karnaa kehh aap ko film key liye ijazat hay (First check that you have permission to film):** While true, it's *part* of the investigation, not the whole recommendation.
* **B: Ezaafi license haasil karnaa (Obtaining an extra license):** The passage mentions needing extra licenses *if* required, but doesn't recommend getting one proactively.  It's about knowing what's needed.
* **D: Sirf bheed bhaad waley elaqey mein film karna jahaan ko dekha na jaa sakey (Only filming in crowded areas where you can't be seen):** The passage explicitly warns *against* flying drones over airports or crowds, regardless of legality.



Therefore, **C** is the most comprehensive and accurate reflection of the recommendation made in the passage."
"Ebarat key hiaab sey, eek drone istemaal kenrtey huey film key liye behtareen maqamaat kahaan hein?","The correct answer is **D: Aisey elaqon mein jis keliye aap nein pahley sey ijazat ley rakhi hay** (Areas for which you have already obtained permission).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap drone istemaal kartay hain too pehle hee achhi tarah jaanch kirr lain kahh aap cow kunn cheezon kee film bananay kee ajazat hay our kunn ajazat naamon..."" (If you use a drone, first thoroughly check what you are allowed to film and what is not allowed...).  This directly supports the idea of filming *only* in locations where you have prior permission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aisee bheed key paas jo drone ki mojudgi sey parishaan nahein hoti hein** (Near a crowd that is not disturbed by the presence of a drone) - While avoiding disturbance is good practice, it doesn't address the *legality* of filming.  You still need permission.
* **B: Aisey elaqon mein jahaan baqaeddh photography ki ijazat nahein hay** (In areas where regular photography is not allowed) - The passage specifically says *don't* even think about video recording if photography isn't allowed.
* **C: Masruf jaghon mein jahaan drone kam maryee hota hay** (Busy places where drones are rarely flown) -  Busy places are often restricted (like airports mentioned in the passage) and lack of other drones doesn't mean it's legal.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad, visa amal ki registory ki zarurat key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee naein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tamaam mamalik ko maqami hukkaam sey inderaaj karanaa zaruri hay** (All countries require registration with local authorities).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that registration is an *additional requirement in **some** countries* ( *kachh mamalik mean*). It doesn't say it's required in *all* countries.  It also highlights variations in how registration is done – sometimes with police, immigration, or hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Agar aap sayyah ki rehaaesh gaahon mein qiyaam kar rahey hein to ho sakta hay aap ko inderaaj karney ki zarurat na ho** (If you are staying in tourist accommodations, you may not need to register) - This is supported by the statement that hotels might handle registration in some countries.
*   **C: Muntaqili office mein janey ki zarurat ho sakti hay** (You may need to go to the immigration office) - The text mentions going to the immigration office as a possible requirement.
*   **D: Kuch maqamaat mein maqami hotel inderaaj ko sanbhaal saktey hein** (In some places, local hotels can handle registration) - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon eek aisi jagah nahein hay jahaan inderaaj ko sanbhaalney key liye eek sayyah ko janaa ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek maqami post office (A local post office)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

* **The text states:** Registration (Wezah key proces) *might* require going to local police stations or immigration offices. It *also* mentions hotels *might* handle registration in some countries.
* **Therefore:** Police stations, hotels, and immigration offices are all possibilities for registration.
* **The text does NOT mention post offices** as being involved in the registration process for travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek maqami police station (A local police station)** - Explicitly mentioned in the text.
* **B: Jiss hotel mein wohh tharey huey hein (The hotel they are staying in)** -  The text says hotels *might* handle registration.
* **D: Muntaqili officein (Immigration offices)** - Explicitly mentioned in the text.



"
Safar karney key doraan kisko razakaranah kaam karney fayedah nahein hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaafi tankhawah ki talaash karney walaa koyi shakhs**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many volunteer positions *do* provide room and board and a small stipend, but it's not a substantial salary. It's presented as a way to potentially make a place affordable, not as a high-paying job. Someone looking for a significant income would not benefit from volunteering abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naye dost bananey ki ummid rakhney waley kisi shakhs ko bairune mulk janaa hoga:** The passage highlights meeting new people as a benefit of volunteering.
*   **C: Nayee maharat haasil karney ki ummid rakhney walaa koyi shakhs:** The passage specifically mentions gaining new skills as a benefit.
*   **D: Koyi aisa shakhs jo ho sakta hay kehh kamrah ya bairune mulk mein dilchaspi na rakhta ho:** Volunteering abroad inherently requires *some* interest in being in a different place, so someone without that interest wouldn’t volunteer in the first place.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bairune mulk hotey huey razakaranah kaam karnaa kisi bajat waley mosaafir key liye fayedah mand kaisey hay?","The correct answer is **C: Kamrah aur board ki baaz auqaat pesh kash ki jaati hay (Room and board are sometimes provided)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...kayee razakarana mulazimatein rehaish our khaana farahim kurti hain..."" which translates to ""...many volunteer positions provide accommodation and food..."". This directly addresses how volunteering abroad can help someone on a budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eek tankhawah taqriban hamesha faraham ki jaati hay (A salary is almost always provided):** The passage states ""chand mukhtasir tankhwah bhee deeti hain"" (a small salary is also given), implying it's *not* always provided.
*   **B: Yehh omuman rozgaar key mawaqea ka baaes hota hay (It usually leads to employment opportunities):** The passage doesn't mention employment opportunities.
*   **D: Yehh noqtaye nazar ka mafhoom haasil karney mein aap ki madad karta hay (It helps you gain a sense of perspective):** While true, this is a general benefit of travel and volunteering and isn't specifically related to being on a budget.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the text in relation to a budget traveler.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez ko Walt Disney duniyaa key motawassit safar eek aam samjhaa jaa skata hay?","The correct answer is **C: Disney ki jayedaad parr mokammal safar guzaarna** (Spending a full trip on Disney property).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*taqriba eek hafta guzarna, our waps ghar lotna shaamil hay.*"" (spending approximately a week, and returning home is included).  It then specifically mentions staying at a Disney-owned hotel (""*ddezni malkiyat cow turk kiye baghair taqriba eek hafta guzarna*"").  This highlights that the typical trip involves being *fully* immersed in the Disney experience - on their land, in their hotels, for the duration of the week.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Parkon ki daryaaft karney walaa haftah guzaarna** (Spending a week exploring the parks) - While park visits *are* part of the trip, the passage emphasizes the entire experience, including lodging.
* **B: Site sey baahar hotel mein qiyaam karnaa** (Staying in a hotel off-site) - The passage specifically notes staying in a Disney-owned hotel as part of the typical trip, making this incorrect.
* **D: Airport sey hotel tak bus lenaa** (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel) - This is a small detail of the trip, not the overall average understanding of it.



"
Walt Disney duniya key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Airport sey jayedaad tak ley jaaney key liye busein dastiyaab hein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Misali doray mean aurlendo been alaqwami tairaan gah purr parwazein,aan saait ddezni hotel mean masrufiyat..."" This translates to ""Typically involves flights from international airports, and staying at Disney hotels...""  It mentions flights and hotels, but *doesn't* mention buses from the airport to the property.  It's implied you'd likely fly and then go to a Disney hotel, but the text doesn't confirm bus transportation.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Paark ki ummid rakhney waley ticket deegar mosaafiron keliye qabiley mutaqili nahein hein** - The passage explicitly states ""ticket qaabil manqali nahein hain"" (tickets are not transferable).
* **B: Site parr rehaaesh dastiyaab hay** - The passage mentions staying at ""ddezni hotel"" (Disney hotels), indicating accommodation is available on site.
* **D: Kaseer ayyam key ticket aksar boli ki websiton parr paye jaatey hein** - The passage states ""Lamahdud ikhtelafi baatein mumkin hain, leakin yahee baat rah jaati hay ju """"dazni world jaaney"""" kee baat kartay hoay ziyadah ther logon kee maraad hoti hay. Nilami kee web sites jaisakah ebay yaa craigslist key zariye aan line farokhat kiye gaye bhat say tickets jazwi toor purr istemaal kardah milti day hopper tickets hain."" (Many variations are possible, but this is what most people mean when they say ""going to Disney World."" Used tickets are often found online on auction sites like eBay or Craigslist).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsey masalah ka bahut mumkanah tor parr peshah waranah tarbiyat key class yaa ishaaton mein ehaatah nahein kiya jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Jangali zindagi ki baqaa (Survival in the wilderness)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses heavily on training for a ""war-torn region"" (""jung zadah elaqah"") and specifically mentions survival related to *that* context. It details training like first aid (""frist aid""), weapon handling (""hathiyaron kee training""), and references books and materials related to war zones (""jangi elaqon say mutaliq matbuaat""). 

While survival skills are *part* of preparing for a war zone, the passage doesn't suggest broader wilderness survival training. The focus is on urban/conflict survival.  

Let's look at why the other options are covered:

* **B: Pahley taawun ki tayyaari (First aid preparation):** Explicitly mentioned (""bhat say frist aid"").
* **C: Jang key mintaqah ki tayyaari (Preparation for a war zone):** This is the central theme of the passage.
* **D: Kirdaar adaa karnaa (Role playing):** Mentioned as a component of the curriculum (""role play"").



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsey mauzu ka eek peshah waranah tarbiyat ki class mein ehaatah kiya jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Jangali zindagi ki baqaa (Survival in wilderness)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * ""Veeranay kee baqaa"" (survival in wilderness)
    * ""Jang zadah elaqah tasavur kiya jasakta hay"" (imagining a war-torn area - implying survival skills in harsh environments)
    * ""frist aid"" (first aid - a key survival skill)
    * ""hathiyaron kee training"" (weapons training - often part of survival training)
    * Books and resources on wilderness survival are common, but materials on war zones are scarce.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Pahla taawun (First Aid):** While first aid *is* included in the training, it's only *one part* of a larger survival curriculum.
* **B: Jang key mintaqey (War Zones):** The passage mentions war zones, but primarily as a scenario for training, not as the central focus of the course. The availability of resources on war zones is stated to be limited.
* **D: Muanedanah mahaul (Adverse Environment):** This is too broad. While the training prepares for adverse environments, it's specifically geared towards *survival* in those environments.



Therefore, the overall context of the passage points to a professional training class focused on **survival skills**, with elements drawn from wilderness and potentially war-zone scenarios."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mumkanah aaludah paani sey bacchney key liye behtareen ikhteyaar kia hay?","The correct answer is **B: Botal ka paani kharidein (Buy bottled water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*too phir aap eek qaabil bharosah company say eek mehr band bottle mean aap cow paani khareedne purr ghoor karnaa chahiye*."" (…then you should carefully consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reliable company).  This directly recommends bottled water as a reliable option when you are concerned about water contamination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kayi minton tak paani ubaalein (Boil water for many minutes):** The passage mentions boiling for *either* one minute *or* several minutes, depending on the location, but doesn't specify *many* minutes as the *best* option.
* **C: eek minat paani ubaalein (Boil water for one minute):** This may be sufficient in *some* areas, but the passage implies it's not always enough.
* **D: Makhsus khatraat key liye paani ka andazah karnaa (Assess water for specific threats):**  The passage mentions assessing threats but doesn't present this as the *best* way to avoid contaminated water. It suggests taking precautions *after* realizing the potential threats.



"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez qareebi tor parr mumkin ho sakti hay neez maahir tairaakon key liye?","The correct answer is **C: Bahao key khilaaf tairnaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ziyadah ther amwaat paani key dhaar key khalaaf ternay kee koshish, ju shayed naa mumkin hay, kee wajah say paida honey waali thakawat key natijay mean hoti hain.""  This translates to: ""Exhaustion results from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.""

While the passage acknowledges the difficulty and potential impossibility, it *specifically mentions* attempting to swim against the current as something that happens, implying it's at least *tried* by skilled swimmers, even if not successfully.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qareebi qurbat sey chatano tak mein tairnaa (Swimming close to rocks):** The passage mentions currents ending at shores often with pebbles or similar things, but doesn't focus on swimming *to* the rocks.
*   **B: Gahrey paani mein tairnaa (Swimming in deep water):** The passage notes deep water can have strong currents but doesn't suggest skilled swimmers *seek* it out.
*   **D: lahron key ird gird tairnaa (Swimming around waves):** The passage focuses on the current (dhaar) more than the waves (lehron).



"
Agar aap bahao mein fans jayein to aap ko kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Doosri samt ka maqsad lekar bahao sey nikalney ki koshish karnaa, fir aam andaaz mein waapas saahil tak tairnaa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ziyadah ther amwaat paani key dhaar key khalaaf ternay kee koshish, ju shayed naa mumkin hay, kee koshish, ju shayed naa mumkin hay, kee wajah say paida honey waali thakawat key natijay mean hoti hain."" (Excessive effort trying to swim *against* the current leads to exhaustion, and may be impossible).  This rules out B and C.
* **The passage also suggests:** Trying to escape the current (""Jaise hee tham dhaaray say nikal aaogay..."") and then swimming back to shore (""waisay hee teraki hasbi mamool aasaan nahein how jaye gee."") implies aiming for a point *beside* the current to get out, and *then* swimming to shore.
* **D (Swimming underwater) is not mentioned** and would be dangerous without knowing the current's dynamics.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss mahalle waqoo mein kisi mahal ka daurah eek qabiley qadar chutti ka safar hogaa?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine waadi mein**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""jehaaz say daryaae danob key kinaray dilchasp shehron kee seyahat"" (travel by boat along the banks of the Danube and visit interesting cities) and ""airy nehar say kashti kaa safar"" (boat trip on a canal).  The Rhine Valley is known for its beautiful river scenery, castles, and charming towns – fitting the description of a good place for excursions by boat or visiting castles, similar to the Danube examples given.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Danube key atraaf eek shahar:** While the Danube is mentioned, the passage talks about *areas around* dairy farms, not just cities *on* the Danube.
* **B: Erie Canal key saamney:** The Erie Canal isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Kisi bhi andaruney zameen paani ka wasilah key qareeb:** This is too broad. The passage focuses on specific types of excursions (castles, river travel) and isn't simply about *any* inland waterway.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon uss elaqah mein safar karney wali khawateen key liye sifarish kardah noktah hogaa?","The correct answer is **B: Iss baat sey aagah rahein kehh saqafati ekhtelafaat maqaami logon key taaqatwar rawayyah ko uksaa saktey hein** (Be aware that cultural differences can provoke strong reactions from locals).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Khwateen cow yeah adraak honaa chahiye kahh saqafati tafriq kaa natijah yeah nikal sakta hay kahh wah kasee aam baat cow haraa saanee shamaar kirr bethein, kasee kaa peecha karnaa, isko baazo say pakadna waghairah koyee mamool key barkhalaaf baat nahein hay."" (Women should understand that as a result of cultural differences, something normal to them could be considered harassment, pursuit, or an inappropriate touch.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mawaad ki haalat sey bachna** (Avoid material conditions) - The passage mentions avoiding *ostentatious* jewelry, but it doesn't focus on avoiding material conditions in general.
* **C: Chamakdaar zewar pahananey sey bachein** (Avoid wearing shiny jewelry) - While mentioned, this is a specific detail *supporting* the broader idea of understanding cultural differences. It isn’t the main recommendation.
* **D: Jabb zarurat ho sakhti ka istemaal karein** (Use firmness when necessary) - The passage *does* say men should be firm, but the core recommendation *for women* is to be *aware* of the potential for misinterpretation due to cultural differences.



Therefore, the main point for women traveling to this region, according to the text, is to be aware of how their actions might be perceived differently due to local cultural norms."
Ebarat mein wazahat kardah elaqah ki buniyaad parr khawateen mosaafiron key liye madadgaar noktah kiya hogaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Gair matlubah taraqqiyon ki surat mein thukraaney waley mardon key saath saabit qadam rahein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mardon cow manaa karnay key baaray mean sakht rahoo our apnay moaqif purr datay rehney say math draw(saqafati tafriq how yaa nah how, yeah use sahih nahein banata!)""  This directly translates to ""Be firm in refusing men and don't back down from your position (whether there is a cultural difference or not, it doesn't make it right!)."" This means women should be assertive and stand their ground against unwanted advances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanakht karein kehh iss ki pairawee karnaa aam nahein hay (Recognize that following this is not common):** While the passage acknowledges potential cultural differences, it doesn't advise women to *recognize* it's uncommon, but rather to *not be swayed by it*.
* **B: Martial haalat ki alaamat bataney key liye eek badi anguthi pahnein (Wear a large ring to signal marital status):** The passage *mentions* wearing a ring, but primarily to indicate marital status, not as a direct defensive measure. It also specifies it shouldn't be *just* a very expensive ring.
* **C: Samjhein kehh saqafati ekhtelafaat iss baat ki tajweez kartey hein kehh aap apni zameen parr khadey honey sey bachein (Understand that cultural differences suggest you avoid standing your ground):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises. It specifically says cultural differences *do not* justify unwanted behavior and women should hold firm.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kis manzar naamah ko darkaar hay kehh eek jangali zindagi ka photographer eek khaas lens ka istemaal karey?","The correct answer is **A: Agar wohh khaas tor parr chotee makhluqaat ki tasweer ley rahey hon** (If they are specifically photographing small creatures).

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Wild life photography mean aksar eek lambi telly photo lens ke zaroorat hoti hay, halanki parindon key jhund yaa ek chhoti makhluq jaisi cheezon key liye dosray lens kee zaroorat hoti hay."" (Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, *however*, other lenses are needed for things like flocks of birds or **small creatures**.)

This directly connects the need for a *different* (specific) lens to photographing small creatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar tasweerein eqtesaadi maqasid key liye istemaal ki jaa rahee hon** (If the pictures are being used for economic purposes) - The passage mentions commercial photography rules in parks, but doesn't link this to needing a specific lens.
* **C: Agar tasweer liye jaa rahey janwar sharmiley hon** (If the animals being photographed are shy) - Shyness is a challenge, but doesn't dictate a particular lens choice.
* **D: Agar park mein jangali zindagi ki photography key baarey mein khaas qanoon hon** (If there are specific laws about wildlife photography in the park) - Similar to B, laws are a logistical consideration, not a reason for choosing a specific lens.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska ebaarat mein jangali zindagi key photographer key liye mumkanah challenge tor parr zikr nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jarehaanah janwaron key saath bartao karnaa (Dealing with aggressive animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the challenges of wildlife photography, including:

*   **Difficulty in finding wild animals:** (implied in ""Gher milki janwaron kaa panna bhat mashkal hay"")
*   **Needing the right lenses:** (""Wild life photography mean aksar eek lambi telly photo lens ke zaroorat hoti hay..."")
*   **Working in challenging environments:** (""maahul surd, garam, yaa basurati deegar mukhalifana how sakta hay."")

However, the passage *doesn't* mention the photographer actively *interacting* with or ""dealing with"" aggressive animals. It notes they can be shy or aggressive, but focuses on the difficulties of *capturing* them, not managing interactions.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Makhsus gair mulki janwaron ki talaash karnaa (Searching for specific exotic animals):** This is implied by the difficulty in finding wild animals generally.
*   **C: Matlubah lens ki qism ko Source karnaa (Sourcing the desired type of lens):** The passage specifically states the need for long telephoto lenses and other lenses for different subjects.
*   **D: Mumkanah mokhaalefanah mahaul mein kaam karnaa (Working in potentially challenging environments):** The passage explicitly mentions harsh, hot, or other adverse weather conditions.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon mumkanah tor parr pahaadi guzar gaahon mein safar kerney waley kisi driver key liye kam az kam masayel ki wajah bann sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Hadd sey ziyaadah kasafat (Excessive fog)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Barf garnay yaa adnay say yaa gaadi kee khadkiyon purr kasafat yaa barf key honey kee wajah say bhee kachh dikhayi nahein deeta"" (Due to snowfall or fog, or due to fog or snow on the car windows, nothing can be seen). This directly links fog/kasafat to visibility issues, which are a major problem for drivers.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely based on the passage:

* **A: Bhaari traffic (Heavy traffic):** The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion.
* **B: Kam ragad (Low friction):** The passage *does* mention low friction (""Barfilay our olay waale raaston purr ragad cum hoti hay our aap gaadi nahein chilla saktay""), but frames it as a consequence of the ice and snow, not a primary cause of problems *in itself*. It's what happens *because* of the snow/ice.
* **D: Kam kardah mariyat (Low courtesy):**  The passage doesn't discuss driver behavior or etiquette.



"
Mukhtalif mamalik mein aamdani tax key baarey mein kisko mustaqil rahnaa mumkin hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Bracketein (Brackets)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...mukhtalif mamalik mean income takes kaa khaakah mukhtalif andaaz mean tayaar kiya jaataa hay our **eek milk say dosray milk key takes kee sharah our brackets** baday paimanay purr mukhtalif hotay hain."" 

This directly translates to ""different countries prepare income tax schemes in different ways and **the rates and brackets** of tax differ greatly from one country to another.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qimatein (Values):** While tax *values* change, the passage focuses on the structure of how taxes are determined.
*   **B: Saakht (Structure):** While the structure is *mentioned* as differing, the specific element highlighted as being different is the brackets.
*   **C: Jahaan aap darj kartey hein (Where you register):** Registration location affects *where* you pay, but not the *amount* or *structure* of the tax.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...aam toor purr berun milk mean kaam karnay kaa matlab yeah hay kahh aap jis milk mean maqeem hain vahan aapko income takes jamma karnaa paray gaa.""  This translates to: ""...generally working abroad means you will have to pay income tax in the country where you are residing.""

The passage directly links working abroad to paying taxes in the *country where you are working/residing*.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jahaan aapki aam tor parr buniyaad hoti hay (Where your general base is)** - The passage doesn't mention a ""general base.""
* **B: Amrika mein (In America)** - The passage only uses America as an example of a country with federal and local taxes.
* **D: Jahaan fees sabsey kam ho (Where the fees are lowest)** -  The passage doesn't mention choosing a country based on tax rates, only that rates *differ*.

Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr eek duniya key meley ki wazahat karta hay?,"The best answer is **B: Nabataati nazaron ko fankaranah aur taleemi nazaron key saath dikhaya jaye** (Botanical displays are shown with artistic and educational displays).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions:** ""Been alaqwami baghbani kee numaish keliye khususi taqribaat munaqid kiye jaatay hain jis mean phulon kee numaish, nabatiyati baghat our podon say mutaliq kayee cheezon kee numaish kee jaati hay."" (Special events are organized for international horticulture displays, in which flower exhibitions, botanical gardens and many things related to plants are displayed.)  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nazarey eek mulk ki tareekh aur saqafat ko dikha sakti hay** (Views can show a country's history and culture) - While the passage *mentions* countries displaying their culture and history, it's not the *defining* characteristic of a world fair. It's *one* aspect.
* **C: Taqribaat chah mahinon tak jaari rah sakti hein** (Events can last for six months) - The passage states events ""amuman then say chh maah thak jaari rehte hain"" (usually last from three to six months), but this is a characteristic of the *duration* not the definition of the event itself.
* **D: Mulkon ko shirkat karney ki zarurat nahein hay** (Countries do not need to participate) - The passage begins by saying ""Shirkat karnay waale mamalik..."" (Participating countries...), clearly indicating participation *is* required.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text."
Darjah zail mein sey kon duniya key melah yaa aalami nomaesh qanoon hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Nazaron ko mulk ki tareekh aur aalami masayel dono ko dikhanaa zaruri hay** (It is necessary to show both the country's history and global issues to the viewers).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Shirkat karnay waale mamalik nay aalamgir masail yaa apnay milk kee saqafat our tareekh cow ajagar karnay key liye qomi povilienz mean fankarana our taleemi mazahire pesh kiye."" (Participating countries presented artistic and educational exhibits to highlight global issues or their country's culture and history).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Salanah buniyaad parr eek hi mulk taqribaat ki mezbaani nahein kar sakta** (A single country cannot host the event on an annual basis) - The passage says they *can* happen annually, but are not *always* held annually, and doesn't mention hosting restrictions.
* **C: Taqribaat ko chah mahinon tak jaari rahna zaruri hay** (The event must last for six months) - The passage states they *usually* last 6 months, but doesn't say it's a requirement.  It says ""amuman then say chh maah thak jaari rehte hain"" (usually last from three to six months).
* **D: Melah key muaqid honey key liye, tamaam mamalik ko shirkat karna zaruri hay** (All countries must participate for the fair to be valid) - The passage doesn't state that *all* countries must participate.

Darjha zail mein sey kiya karney sey kisi janwar key hamlah ka imkaan kam ho jayegaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Camp ki site sey kudaa hatanaa (Removing trash from the campsite)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mazeed iss baat kaa khayal rahaiye ki badbudar khaana reechh our dosray jungli janwaron cow raghib karta hay. chunancha badbudar khaana laanay yaa pakanay say graze karein our camp cow saaf rakhein."" (Also keep in mind that smelly food attracts bears and other wild animals. Therefore, graze and keep the camp clean by not bringing or cooking smelly food.)  Removing trash eliminates the smell that attracts animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khusbudaar jadi buti lekar janaa (Bringing fragrant herbs):** The passage warns *against* bringing things with strong smells.
* **C: Bhediyon sey 25 gaz faselah rakhnaa (Staying 25 gaz away from wolves):** The passage says to stay 100 guz/meters from deer and wolves, and 25 guz/meters from *other* wild animals. This is a correct distance, but not the *most* effective way to reduce attack risk overall (keeping the camp clean is more preventative).
* **D: Khaney key tukdey ki madad sey janwaron ko roknaa (Stopping animals with food scraps):** This is extremely dangerous and the opposite of what the passage advises! You should *never* feed or try to interact with wild animals.

Darjah zail mein sey kiska ebarat mein jangali zindagi key hamlon ki mumkanah wajah key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Insaanon key saath gair maanus janwar** (Interaction with non-human animals).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **B: Fasalah barqaraar rakhney mein nakaam** (Failing to maintain a safe distance) - The text states visitors are injured ""keun kah wah munasib dori nahein rakhtay"" (because they don't maintain a suitable distance).
    * **C: Jangali janwar ko khilanaa** (Feeding wild animals) - The text warns against ""kachh khilana chahiye nah inn cow chhedna chahiye"" (you shouldn't feed or bother them).
    * **A: Tez boo** (Strong odor) - The text specifically states ""badbudar khaana reechh our dosray jungli janwaron cow raghib karta hay"" (smelly food attracts deer and other wildlife).

* **D: Insaanon key saath gair maanus janwar** (Interaction with non-human animals) - While the passage *implies* interaction can be dangerous, it doesn't specifically state that general interaction *causes* attacks. It focuses on specific behaviors like getting too close or feeding them.
