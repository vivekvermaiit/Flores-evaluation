"Segun iti mabasa, ania koma ti maikonsiderar a saan a nakanatad a singasing tapno sibaballigi a makatokar iti akordion?","The correct answer is **C: Siguraduem a tamaan dagiti nota bayat ti pagmentenar ti nakarelaks nga ima**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Seguraduem a nakarelaks ti imam bayat a nakarelaks ti imam bayat a husto a tamaam dagiti nota..."" (Ensure your hand is relaxed while accurately hitting the notes...). This directly addresses the ideal approach to playing comfortably and effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While using the right pressure is mentioned, it's about *achieving* the sound, not the primary consideration for comfortable playing.
*   **B:**  The passage mentions avoiding *excessive* force, but preserving energy isn't the central idea of making playing comfortable.
*   **D:** This relates specifically to accordion playing and using fingers/buttons for tone, it isn’t a general principle of relaxed playing.

"No agtokar iti akordion, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti makatulong tapno manayonan ti pigsana?","The correct answer is **A: Ad-adu a pardas**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""No usarem ti akordion, tapno manayonam ti pigsana, usarem dagiti yubuyoban nga adda nayonna a pigsa wenno **pardas**."" (If using the accordion, to improve the tone, use fingers with more pressure or **bellows**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ad-adu a talmeg:** The passage actually advises *against* forcing the keys.
*   **C: Basbassit a presion:** The passage states to use fingers with *more* pressure (or bellows).
*   **D: Basbassit a garaw ti ramramay:**  The passage aims to avoid *too much* movement, but doesn't suggest minimizing it altogether.



"
Apay a puted dagiti beddeng ti ladawan a makitam iti telebision?,"The correct answer is **B: Tapno maakkuban ti ladawan ti sibubukel nga screen.**

The passage explicitly states that overscan is done ""tapno masigurado a maakkuban ti imahen ti sibubukel nga screen.""  The cutting off of the edges (and potentially subtitles) is a *result* of this, not the reason *for* it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a problema ti mapasamak no mangi-convert iti pelikula ti format ti DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Puted a paset a subtitulo** (Cut-off subtitles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when converting a film to DVD, the edges *can* be cut off, and if the video has subtitles near the bottom, they *might not be fully visible*. This is due to the overscan issue common in televisions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ladawan a saan maakkuban ti sibubukel nga screen** (Image not filling the entire screen) - The passage says TVs are *made* to cut off the edges *so* the image fills the screen. This isn't a problem with the DVD conversion itself, but a characteristic of TVs.
*   **C: Ladawan a maakkuban ti sibubukel nga screen** (Image filling the entire screen) -  This is the *goal* of overscan, not a problem that arises from the conversion.
*   **D: Puted a bedbeddeng** (Cut-off edges) - While the passage mentions edges can be cut off, the specific problem highlighted is with *subtitles* being affected.



"
Sadinno ti pasakarakan ti garison ti Briton?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states that General Cadwalder will attack the British garrisons **in Bordentown**. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Assunpink Creek** - This is where Ewing's forces will cross and potentially engage troops, but it's not where the garrison is located.
*   **B: Trenton** - The main force is heading *towards* Trenton, but the garrison being attacked is in Bordentown.
*   **D: Princeton** - Princeton isn't mentioned in the passage as a location of a British garrison or attack."
Akinpirma iti nagparang idiay insurat ti ima a draft?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...a handwritten draft signed by President of the Congress John Hancock **and Secretary Charles Thomson** was sent..."" 

Therefore, Charles Thomson was one of the people who signed the handwritten draft.



"
"Manipud kadagiti sumaganad a lokasion, sadinno iti naudi a nakadanonan ti Dunlap broadside?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The text states: ""Maysa a kopia ti nakadanon iti London idi Agosto 10."" (A copy reached London on August 10.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York:** While a copy was read to troops in New York, it wasn't the *final* destination mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Imprentaan ni Dunlap:** The broadsides *originated* from Dunlap's printing shop, but weren't meant to stay there.
*   **D: Independence Hall:** This is where the first public reading happened, but the text specifies London as the last location mentioned.



"
Sadinno ti kinapuestoan dagiti tropa ni Koronel Stark?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti amianan a pungto, iti ayan ti alad**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nagpuesto dagiti tao ni Stark iti ayan ti alad iti amianan a pungto ti ayan dagiti Colonista."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iti igid ti baybay idiay aplaya:** While they built a short stone wall *near* the shore, this wasn't their primary position.
* **C: Idiay amianan a daya ti peninsula:** The Mystic River is northeast of the peninsula, but that's where they *created a gap* – not where Stark’s troops were positioned.
* **D: Iti sango ti alad:** They placed an abatis (a barrier of felled trees) *near* the crest of the redoubt, but weren't positioned *at* the crest itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano nga inatiddagan dagiti tropa ni Stark ti alad?","The correct answer is **C: Bayat ti nababa ti panagayus ti danum**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Idi nagaramid ti giwang ti panagugot idiay Karayan Mystic idiay amianan a daya ti peninsula, pinartakanda nga inatiddagan ti bakod babaen iti panagusar ti ababa a pader a bato a mapan amianan agingana iti igid ti baybay idiay bassit nga aplaya."" This clearly indicates they fortified the redoubt *while* the tide was low in the Mystic River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bayat ti panangayab ti Colonist kadagiti tumulong** - While the colonists were seeking aid, this isn't *when* they fortified the redoubt.
*   **B: Kalpasan ti panaglabas dagiti regular** - The text states they were ordered *not* to fire until the regulars passed. This means they fortified it *before* any potential engagement with the regulars.
*   **D: Bayat ti panagabante ti posision dagiti tropa** - Fortifying the redoubt was part of establishing their position, but the timing is specifically tied to the low tide.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maysa a kararanggas a panawen iti Tsina?","The correct answer is **D: Panawen Iti Tallo a Pagarian**.

The passage specifically states that the ""Panawen Iti Tallo a Pagarian"" (Three Kingdoms period) was a period of chaos and war in Ancient China, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties. It is described as a turbulent time with many rulers fighting for the throne.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dinastia ti Jin** - The Jin dynasty *followed* the Three Kingdoms period, it wasn't a chaotic period itself according to the text.
*   **B: Panawen iti Xi’an** - Xi’an is a city, the location of the palace, not a period of time.
*   **C: Dinastia ti Han** - The Han dynasty *preceded* the Three Kingdoms period, it wasn't a chaotic period itself according to the text.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti pudno dagiti pangen ti kuton nga sumsumrek ti nomadic a tiempo?","The correct answer is **C: Agar-aramidda ti pagiananda a mabaliwan kalpasan ti 17 aldaw.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ti kolonia ket agar-aramid ti sinsinan a pagiananda a mabaliwan iti innaldaw. Agpaut iti aganay a 17 nga aldaw tunggal maysa kadagitoy a nomadic a panagranggas wenno panagmartsa."" This translates to ""the colony would make a simple shelter that would be changed in the daylight. It would take about 17 days for each of these nomadic travels or marches.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agaramidda ti pagiananda bayat ti rabii** (They make their shelters at night) - The passage states they *change* their shelters in the daylight, not make them at night.
* **B: Bassit ti kasapulanda a makan** (They need little food) - The passage mentions visiting rich pastures for food, implying they need a significant amount.
* **D: Agmarmartsada bayat ti aldaw** (They march during the day) - The passage specifically states they march at night and rest during the day: ""dagiti soldado a kuton ket agmartsai ti rabii ken agsardeng iti aldaw."" (the cotton soldiers march at night and rest during the day).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti pudno a mangiyanninaw iti ugali dagiti pangen ti kuton bayat ti nomadic a tiempo?","The correct answer is **C: Balbaliwanda ti pagiananda innaldaw.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ti kolonia ket agar-aramid ti sinsinan a pagiananda a mabaliwan iti innaldaw."" (the colony would make a temporary shelter that would be changed in the daylight). This directly supports the idea that they *changed* their shelters daily.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agar-aramidda ti pagiananda bayat ti rabii** - While they *made* shelters, the passage focuses on changing them, not just making them at night.
*   **B: Agmarmartsada ti 17 aldaw nga saanda agaramid ti pagiananda** - The passage states the marches lasted *about* 17 days, and they *were* building shelters.
*   **D: Usarenda ti agpada nga pagianan bayat ti tiempo** - The passage specifically says they *changed* their shelters, meaning they didn't use the same one.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti agtultuloy latta a mailaksid ti presensia ti nakinruar a signal?,"The correct answer is **A: Siklo nga endogenous**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...dagiti siklo nga endogenous ken ti panagpa-aduda babaen iti orasan a biolohikal... agtultuloy iti maysa a panawen nga is-isuna nga agan-andar uray awan ti mangpagaraw.""  This means endogenous cycles *continue even without external signals*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ritmo a periodiko:** These are *observed* rhythms, and while they can be driven by endogenous cycles, the rhythm itself isn't what continues independently. It's the underlying cycle.
* **C: Orasan a biolohikal:** This *influences* the endogenous cycles but isn't the cycle itself.  It needs the endogenous cycle to work with.
* **D: Maobserbaran a ritmo:** These are the observable results and, by definition, require something to *observe* – a process happening.  They aren’t independent of signals or cycles.



"
Ania a termino ti mangiladawan kadagiti indibidual a mangipakita ti nadumaduma a klase ti phenotypic a galad?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""No dagiti indibidual ket mangipakita ti nadumaduma a klase ti kangrunaan a kababalin isuda ket polymorphic."" (If individuals exhibit different classes of a main trait, they are polymorphic.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic** - The passage defines monomorphic as the *opposite* of having different traits – it means all individuals are the same.
* **B: Dagiti organismo** (Organisms) - This is too broad.  The question is asking about individuals *within* a population with varied traits.
* **C: Sebbangan** (Species) - This refers to the broader classification of living things, not the variation *within* a population.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti husto a termino para iti organismo a sumakop ti partikular a lugar?,"The correct answer is **B: Populasion**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly defines ""populasion"" as ""koleksion ti organismo iti partikular a sebbangan ti maysa a lugar.""** This is exactly what the question is asking for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic** -  Describes a *characteristic* of a population (all individuals having the same trait), not the group itself.
* **C: Sebbangan** -  Refers to the *type* of organism, not the group in a specific location. (e.g., humans are a species, but not a population on their own)
* **D: Polymorphic** - Describes a *characteristic* of a population (individuals having different traits), not the group itself.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a pagarigan dagiti aktibidad ti nature-based tourism?,"The correct answer is **C: Panagbisita ti museo a ciencia (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **Nature-based tourism** specifically focuses on experiencing *natural* environments – plants, animals, ecosystems.

Let's look at each option:

* **A: Panaguli ti dissuor (Hiking/Trekking):**  This is a direct activity *in* nature.
* **B: Panaglitrato dagiti sabong ti atap (Photographing orchid blossoms):** This focuses on observing and documenting *natural* beauty (plants).
* **C: Panagbisita ti museo a ciencia (Visiting a science museum):** While it *relates* to nature, a science museum is an *artificial* environment. It's learning *about* nature, not experiencing it directly.
* **D: Panagbanniit (Birdwatching):** This is a classic nature-based tourism activity, observing wildlife in their natural habitat.

The definition in P clearly emphasizes direct engagement with natural places and wildlife.  A museum doesn't fit that criteria.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pagbasaran ti sistema ti pagluganan?","The correct answer is **B: Pribado a lugan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ken mangsupsuporta, iti maysa a sistema ti transportasion a **naibasar kadagiti pribado a lugan**."" (and supports a transportation system **based on private spaces**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lugar a pagubraan (Place of work):** While the passage mentions people traveling *to* work, the system isn't *based* on workplaces.
*   **C: Nalagda a biospere (Stable biosphere):** The biosphere is mentioned in relation to carbon emissions, not as the foundation of the transportation system.
*   **D: Ebolusion ti tattao (Evolution of humans):** Evolution is discussed as a broader context, not a component of the transportation system.



"
Dagiti partikulo a mangparparikus iti nucleus ket addaan ti ania a kuryente?,"The correct answer is **A: Positibo a kuryente**.

The text states: ""Dagiti proton ket addaan iti positibo a kuryente ngem ti neutron ket awan.""  Since protons are part of the nucleus and have positive charge, the particles orbiting the nucleus (implied by the question) must have positive charge. While neutrons *don't* have a charge, the question asks about the *orbiting* particles, which are protons.



"
Ti nucleus ket addaan ti ania a kadagiti partikulo?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons ken neutrons**.

The text explicitly states: ""Addaan dua a partikulo ti nukleo - dagiti neutron ken dagiti proton."" (The nucleus has two particles - neutrons and protons.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Neutrons ken electrons** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **C: Electrons ken protons** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **D: Protons, neutrons, ken electrons** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pagarigan ti lima a bit a binary a numero?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states a binary number can only have 0 or 1.**  Options A, C, and D all follow this rule.
* **The question asks for a *five*-bit binary number.**  This means the number must contain exactly five digits.
* Option A (1010) has only four digits.
* Option D (110101) has six digits.
* Option B (12001) includes the digits 2, which are not allowed in binary.

Therefore, **C: 10010** is the only option that fits both criteria: it contains only 0s and 1s, and has exactly five digits.



"
Ti binary a digit ket maawagan met laeng nga?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

The passage explicitly states: ""dagitoy a numero maawaganda a binary a digit, wenno **bits**, no usaren ti panagsarsarita a para iti kompiuter."" (these numbers are called binary digits, or **bits**, when used in a conversational way for the computer.)



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat iti mabasa kas maysa a kangrunaan a benepisio ti blogging?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagbassit ti kritisismo gapo iti kakadua.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that blogging *increases* scrutiny and encourages careful writing because of the potential audience. Students are motivated to write well to avoid embarrassment and be understood. It doesn't suggest that blogging leads to *less* criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Panagpasayaat ti gramatika ken abilidad ti panagsurat:** The text explicitly states blogging helps improve writing skills (""makatulong met dagiti blog tapno mapasayaat dagiti estudiante ti panagsuratda""). The process of getting feedback and wanting to present work well drives improvement.
*   **C: Panaglawa ti kinaammo ti aglawlaw:** The passage states that blogging allows students to ""mangipaganetget kadagiti estudiante nga agbalin a nasirib panggep iti aglikmut a lubong kadakuada,"" which means it broadens their understanding.
*   **D: Manayunan ti tarigagay para ti matultuloy a panagsursuro:** The text says blogging encourages continued learning even outside of school (""paregtaenna dagiti estudiante nga ipamaysa ti panagadal uray awanen iti eskuelaan"").



"
Ania kadagit sumaganad nga aspeto ti blogging ti nadakamat a mangtingnay ti estudiante tapno mapasayaat dagiti panagsuratda?,"The correct answer is **A: Aktibo a panangsungbat kadagiti materiales iti internet**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""mabalin a mangpapigsa kadagiti estudiante tapno agbalinda a kritikal ken analitikal; babaen iti aktibo a panangsungbat kadagiti material iti Internet, maikkan kaipapanan dagiti estudiante dagiti posisionda iti konteksto ti sinurat dagiti sabali ken kasta met a maiparangda ti bukodda a perspektibo kadagiti partikular nga isyu."" 

This directly links active engagement with online materials to improved critical thinking and writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti guyugoy a maliklikan ti kritisismo:** The passage actually states that *being seen* by others (potentially facing critique) encourages better writing.
* **C: Panagmentenar ti interes dagiti dum-dumngeg:** While important, this is presented as a consequence of good writing, not the primary driver of improvement.
* **D: Kasapulan ti panagtinnulong:** This is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, but not the specific aspect that *directly* improves writing.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti benepisio ti agsisinnublat a pannakisarita para kadagiti estudiante? ,"The correct answer is **D: Kontol iti addang** (Control of pace).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""palubusan daytoy dagiti estudiante iti abilidadda nga agtrabaho iti bukodda a kinapartak ken makontrol ti impormason nga instruksional"" - This directly translates to allowing students to work at their own pace and control instructional information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti panagusar iti Internet kas maysa a rekurso** (Using the internet as a resource) - While the passage *mentions* the internet, it doesn't identify it as a *benefit* of flexible scheduling specifically. It's a tool *enabled* by it.
* **B: Inaldaw a panagsasango iti mangisursuro iti uray ania nga oras iti aldaw** (Daily consultations with teachers at any time of the day) -  The passage suggests teachers *might* be available more often, but it doesn't state this is a guaranteed benefit for students.  It's more about the potential for faster feedback.
* **C: Nalap-it nga oras ti panagtrabaho** (Shorter working hours) -  The passage states flexibility, not necessarily shorter hours.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aspeto ti agsisinnublat a pannakisarita ti saan a nawaywaya para kadagiti estudiante?","The correct answer is **A: Addang ti panangpanunot (Content of thinking)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the self-paced learning allows students to work at their own *pace* and control *instructional information*. However, it doesn't say they have complete freedom over *what* they think about or the *content* of their learning. The ""pannakisarita"" (self-pacing) controls *how* they learn, not *what* they learn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oras iti trabaho (Work schedule):** The passage explicitly states there are few restrictions and the schedule becomes free.
*   **C: Instruksional a materiales (Instructional materials):** The passage says students can control instructional information.
*   **D: Panagusar iti Internet (Use of the Internet):** The passage highlights that the internet provides access to information anytime, implying freedom in its use.



"
Ania ti saan a nadakamat iti mabasa a mainaig ti mediebal a kastilio?,"The correct answer is **A: Pagbaludan**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically mentions* pagbaludan (stables) as part of the imagined medieval castle experience (""maangot ti buteng a tumpaw kadagiti pagbaludan"" - the smell of hay in the stables).  The passage also talks about panagdadangadang (feasts), dayaw (celebrations), and dagiti kabaliero (knights) as elements of the romanticized image of castles. 

Therefore, pagbaludan is something *found* in the description, making it not something that's *missing* from the discussion of medieval castles.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat iti mabasa nga angot wenno uni a mapanunot dagiti rebba iti kastilio?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuko**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on sights, sounds, and smells associated with castles.** It mentions:
    * **Gubgubat (battles):** ""uni dagiti nalpas a gubgubat"" (sounds of past battles)
    * **Buteng (smoke):** ""maangot ti buteng a tumpaw"" (smell of burning pitch)
    * **Bangkete (banquets):** ""bangkete"" (banquets) are specifically mentioned as part of the Arthurian imagery.

* **Kuko (nails/claws)** doesn't fit this sensory theme. While nails were *used* in construction, the passage doesn't evoke them as something you'd smell, hear, or see in a way that contributes to the imagined atmosphere of the castle.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a panangiladawan ti Kastilo ti Kirby Muxloe?,"Ti correct answer ket **B: Kasapulanna ti minimal a panangdepensa gapo iti nakappia a pagilian idi panawen ti panangipatakder**.

Daytoy ket direktamente a naibaga iti teksto: ""Idi 1480s, idi inrugi nga inpatakder ni Lord Hastings daytoy, ti pagilian ket nakappia ken masapul laeng ii depensa kontra kadagiti babassit a grupo ti agsursursor a marauders.""

Ania kadagiti sumaganad a langa ti panangipatakder ti saan a kadawyan ti Kastilo ti Kirby Muxloe bayat ti panawen a nailadawan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **D: Naiingpis a pader**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti dadakkel a nasileng a tawa ken **naiingpis a paderna**, saan a makabael a mangdaer iti mabayag iti maysa a determinado a panangraut."" (The large window openings and **thin walls** were not able to withstand a prolonged attack.) This directly explains a non-traditional aspect of the castle's construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dadakkel a tawa:** While mentioned, the large windows are *part* of why it wasn't a strong defensive castle, they aren't the primary reason for its unusual construction.  The thin walls are the key.
* **B: Adigi nga inpatakder tapno makabael a mangdaer iti mabayag a panangraut:** The passage explicitly states the opposite – it *wasn't* built to withstand a long siege.
* **C: Basbassit ti panangdepensana ti dadduma a kastilio:** This is a consequence of the construction, but not the construction itself. The *thin walls* are what made it less defensively strong.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kaaduanna a makagunggona para iti agsagsagana a managtaray para iti umay nga panawen?","The correct answer is **A: Panagsanay ti cross country a panagtaray no tiempo ti kalgaw (Cross country running training during the off-season)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti sumagmamano a panagtaray a cross country no tiempo ti lam-ek, a makaduaan iti panagsanay iti gymnasium para iti akingngato a bagi, ti kasayaatan a panagsagana para iti panawen ti panagtaray."" (Several cross country runs during the off-season, combined with gym training for the upper body, is the best preparation for the running season.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agperreng ti panagsukog ti kinapardas bayat ti panagsanay (Focusing on speed measurement during training):** The passage states speed isn't *as* important as endurance.
* **C: Parmeken ti tallo a minuto nga oras (Achieving a three-minute time):** The passage mentions a two-minute time as an example of a top runner, but doesn't state it's a training goal.
* **D: Panagsanay iti gym para iti akingngato a bagi (Gym training for the upper body):** While mentioned, it's stated *in addition to* cross country running, not as the most important factor.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kapatgan para iti managtaray a first-class ti kagudua ti milia?","The correct answer is **B: Sukogen ti kinaibtur ngem ti kinapardas** (Prioritize endurance over speed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...saan unayen nga importante ti kinapardas ket ti kinaibtur ti agbalinen a nangnangruna a kasapulan."" This directly translates to ""speed is not as important as endurance becoming the primary requirement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagsanay ti cross country a panagtaray bayat ti lam-ek** (Cross country training during the rainy season) - While the passage *suggests* cross country training, it doesn't state it's the primary *qualification* for a first-class runner.  It's a preparation method.
* **C: Ag-clock in iti nababbaba ngem dua a minuto** (Clock in under two minutes) - The passage mentions a first-class runner being able to run a two-minute mile, but doesn't say that's the *qualification* itself. It's an example of their ability.
* **D: Sukogen ti kinapardas ngem ti kinaibtur** (Prioritize speed over endurance) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage states.



"
"Para iti atleta, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maragpat gapu laeng ti nutrisional a kababalin?","The correct answer is **C: Elite a panangaramid**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that good nutrition *alone* doesn't guarantee good performance, but it *affects* the overall health of the athlete. It goes on to say it helps with performance *and* recovery. However, it doesn't claim nutrition leads to *elite* performance. Elite performance requires more than just nutrition - it requires training, skill, mental fortitude, and other factors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nasaysayaat a panangaramid (Good performance):** The passage directly connects nutrition to improved performance.
*   **B: Manayunan ti rag-o (Improved recovery):** The passage explicitly mentions nutrition helps improve recovery.
*   **D: Kinaimbag ti kinakaradkad (Good conditioning):** Nutrition supports overall health and therefore contributes to good physical conditioning.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga isingasing a wagas tapno makasapul dagiti ubbing nga atleta ti nayon a rag-o iti ay-ayamda?","The correct answer is **B: Agtuloytuloy ti elite a lebel ti panangaramid**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti nasayaat a pamay-an para iti salun-at laeng ket **saan a makagapu ti nasayaat a panangaramid**, ngem maapektaranda ti kangrunaanga salun-at ti naubing nga atleta."" (Good health practices alone do not guarantee good performance, but they affect the overall health of the young athlete.)

This directly implies that *simply* maintaining a high level of performance (elite performance) isn't what the passage emphasizes for a young athlete's well-being.  It's the *health practices* that are important.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Panagsanay ti nasayaat a nutrision** - This is implied by focusing on ""nasayaat a pamay-an para iti salun-at"" (good health practices).
* **C: Epektibo nga uminom ti danum** - The passage *specifically* mentions ""panangaramid ti epektibo nga ugali nga uminom ti danum"" (developing an effective habit of drinking water).
* **D: Imentenar ti balanse ti nasalun-at a pigsa** - The passage *specifically* mentions ""panangmantenir ti balanse ti nasalun-at a pigsa"" (maintaining a healthy weight balance).

"Segun iti mabasa, apay a gumatang ti middle distance a managtaray ti nanginngina a produkto?","The correct answer is **A: Isu ti maipangpangrunada**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Dagiti atleta a kaykayatda ti maysa a produkto uray awan ti agpayso a benepisiona daytoy."" This directly translates to ""Athletes may want a product even without any incentive benefit."" This means they buy it simply because they *value* the product itself – it's important *to them*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adda ti agpayso a benepisona (There is an incentive benefit)** - The passage explicitly states there's often *little or no* incentive.
* **C: Dakkel unay ti epektona iti panangaramidda (It has a huge effect on their performance)** - The passage doesn't mention a huge effect, just that they might want the product.
* **D: Adda ti saan nga umisu a panangipapan dagiti saan unay a nangina a produkto (There's aggressive marketing of less desirable products)** - While mentioned, this isn't *why* the athletes buy the products, but rather a factor in the overall situation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan iti middle distance a panagtaray?","The correct answer is **A: Adu a produkto**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti produkto ket mabalin a magatang no kasapulan..."" (Products can be bought if needed...) This directly indicates that a lot of products are *required* for middle distance running.
* **The passage also states:** ""...adu dagiti saan nga umisu a panangipapan iti sumagmamano nga alikamen a kasapulan tapno makasali."" (There are many unnecessary expenses for some necessary requirements to participate). This reinforces the need for multiple products/items.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Naipasdek nga atletiko a naggapuan (Established athletic background):** The passage doesn't mention anything about needing a background in athletics.
* **C: Bassit unay a produkto (Very few products):** The passage says products *can* be bought if needed, implying they *are* needed.
* **D: Adu a kuarta (A lot of money):** While the passage mentions unnecessary expenses, it doesn’t state needing *a lot of money* as a requirement. The products are the direct need.



"
Asinno ti nakadiskubre ti nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ken Purcell**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti MRI ket naibasar iti penomena iti pisika a maawagan iti nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a nadiskubre idi dekada 1930 da Felix Bloch (agtrabtrabaho iti Stanford University) ken Edward Purcell (manipud iti Harvard University)."" 

This directly identifies Bloch and Purcell as the discoverers of NMR."
Iti ania a tawen a naikkan ti kaunaan a patente para ti medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Kalpasan ti uppat a tawen [after 1970], naikkan iti patente, ket dayta ti kaunaan a patente iti intero a lubong iti tay-ak ti MRI.""  Therefore, 1970 + 4 = 1974.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti rumbeng a pannakaawat nga addaan koma dagiti tattao tapno mailawlawag dagiti pisikal a paspasamak ti sabali?","The correct answer is **B: Gandat**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...napateg ti pannakaawat iti **gagara ti sabali**.""  ""Gagara"" directly translates to ""feelings"" or ""intentions"" - which is synonymous with **gandat** (will, desire, intent). The passage highlights that understanding *why* someone is doing something (their intent) is crucial for interpreting their actions and predicting behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tarigagay (Experience):** While experience contributes to understanding, the passage focuses on understanding current *intentions* rather than past experiences.
*   **C: Pammati (Belief):** Beliefs are important, but not the primary focus for interpreting immediate physical actions.
*   **D: Panagkita (Seeing):**  Seeing is just the observation of an action; it doesn't explain the *reason* behind it. The passage emphasizes going beyond what is seen.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti pannakaawat ti gandat ket tulongan dagiti tattao nga aramiden ti ania?","The correct answer is **A: Ikkaten ti di masigurado iti pisikal a paspasamak** (Infer the uncertain in a physical event).

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding others' intentions (gandat) allows us to ""solve possible unclear physical occurrences."" The example given – someone reaching for a wallet – demonstrates how understanding intent helps us *interpret* what's happening (are they stealing or simply looking for something?), even when the physical action itself is ambiguous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pugtuan ti tarigagay** (Read minds) - While the passage mentions ""reading minds,"" it clarifies this is about understanding intentions, not directly accessing thoughts.
*   **C: Kitaen ti sabali a tattao nga awan ti panangukom** (See other people without judgment) - The passage focuses on *forming* judgments (and doing so accurately) based on understanding intent, not avoiding judgment altogether.
*   **D: Basaen ti panunot ti sabali** (Read the mind of another) - As in option B, this is too direct. It's about inferring intent, not literally reading minds.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a dagup ti gandat ti AI?","The correct answer is **D: Panag-automate kadagiti trabaho**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Karaman ti panagsukisok iti AI ti panagaramid kadagiti makina tapno ma-automate dagiti trabaho a kasapulan iti masirib a galad."" (Most AI research focuses on creating machines to automate tasks that require human intelligence.)

While planning, voice recognition, and scheduling are *examples* of what AI can do, the overarching goal is automation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti masansan a mainaig iti AI?","The correct answer is **B: Panagplano ken panangiskediul**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Karaman ti panagsukisok iti AI ti panagaramid kadagiti makina tapno ma-automate dagiti trabaho a kasapulan iti masirib a galad. Dagiti pagarigan ket pakairamanan ti **kontrol, panagplano ken panangiskediul**..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Serbisio para ti kostumer:** While the passage mentions AI being able to respond to customer diagnosis and feelings, it doesn't state that customer service *is* commonly associated with AI. It's an example of a capability, not a common association.
*   **C: Science fiction:** The passage acknowledges AI's presence in science fiction but clarifies that it's a branch of computer science.
*   **D: Panangkita ti surat:** This is mentioned as an example of what AI *can* do (recognize handwriting, voice, and images), but not as a commonly associated area.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pigsa ti maysa a tao nga addaan ti managtitipon a pagpanpanunot?","The correct answer is **D: Agikabesa kadagiti disenio**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti tattao nga addaan iti kastoy a klase ti kapanunotan nga addaan iti lohikal a panagpampanunot, ket **makabael nga agikabesa kadagiti disenio**, mangsolbar kadagiti problema ken agobra kadagiti a sientipiko a panangsubok.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panangilasin kaagduduma a husto a sungbat iti maysa a problema:** The passage explicitly states there's *only one* correct answer (""adda laeng maysa a husto a sungbat"").
* **B: Panagaplikar ti barbaro a pamay-an ti maysa a problema:** The passage emphasizes logic and order (""paspas, lohika, ken kinaumiso""), not random approaches.
* **C: In-inut nga usaren ti orasda ti panagsolbar ti problema:** While thoroughness might be *a* characteristic, the passage doesn't specifically mention time spent as a key skill.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a pokus ti managtiptipon a pagpanpanunot?","The correct answer is **B: In-inut nga usaren ti orasna** (Efficiently using time).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the focuses of convergent thinking as:

*   **Paspas** (speed)
*   **Lohika** (logic)
*   **Kinaumiso** (efficiency - though not directly translated as ""using time"", it implies streamlining)
*   **Panangilasin iti kinaagpayso** (identifying relevance)
*   **Panangala iti impormasion** (gathering information)
*   **Adda laeng maysa a husto a sungbat** (only one correct answer)

While efficiency is *related* to time, the passage doesn't specifically highlight *efficiently using time* as a direct focus of convergent thinking. The emphasis is on *being* efficient in the process, not solely on time management.

Therefore, option B is the one that's **not** directly mentioned as a focus within the provided text."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a micro-expression?","The correct answer is **D: Panagngato ti tangan (Raising of the hands)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on **micro-expressions** as *very small, fleeting facial expressions* that occur in milliseconds. They are about subtle shifts in the face that reveal true emotions.

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: Kumitkita iti adayo bayat ti panagsasao (Looking away while speaking)** - This *could* be a micro-expression indicating discomfort or deception.
*   **B: Panagkurok ti kiday (Blinking)** - Blinking is a rapid, subtle facial movement that *can* be part of micro-expressions or indicate cognitive load.
*   **C: Napardas nga pagkidkidem (Brief grimace)** - A grimace is a facial expression, and a *brief* one aligns with the definition of a micro-expression.
*   **D: Panagngato ti tangan (Raising of the hands)** - This is a *large, overt* physical gesture. It's not a subtle facial expression. It's a visible body language signal, but not a micro-expression.

Therefore, raising of the hands is the only option that doesn't fit the description of a micro-expression.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti interpretasion ti micro-expression ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **D: Makatulong a sukimaten ti kinapasnek**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *detecting deception* (lying) and understanding emotions through micro-expressions.** It highlights how video recording helps analyze these fleeting facial cues.
* **Option D, ""Makatulong a sukimaten ti kinapasnek"" (Helps measure happiness),** is the only option that doesn't directly relate to the core theme of the text. While micro-expressions *can* indicate happiness, the passage is about the broader ability to detect *deception* and understand emotional states, not specifically measuring happiness.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Ti video recording ket nangituggod kadagiti nagpateg a pannakatakuat (Video recording has supported significant advancements):** The first sentence explicitly states this.
* **B: Ti husto a panangitarus ket mailasin ti panag-ulbod (Accurate interpretation can detect deception):**  The passage says, ""Maysa a nangruna a mapapati a mabalin a maammuan no agul-ulbod ti maysa a tao babaen iti umno a panangitarus kadagiti babassit unay nga ekspresion."" (A main belief is that one can know if a person is lying through accurate interpretation of very small expressions).
* **C: Ti panagsao kas met kadagiti ekspresion ti rupa ket maitarus (Speech, like facial expressions, can be interpreted):** Oliver Sacks' point about understanding language and truth-telling relates to how we interpret communication, including both spoken words and facial cues.  He suggests a breakdown in one (understanding language) can affect understanding the truth.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kapatgan a resulta ti Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **B: Pannakaiwaras ti pannakaammo** (Dissemination of knowledge).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""In essence, the Renaissance made a significant change in the way of teaching and in the dissemination of knowledge.""  This directly links the Renaissance to a change in *how* knowledge was spread.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panaglagip ti maysa** (One's memory) - The passage talks about memory *being affected* by factors, but doesn't state it as a core result of the Renaissance.
* **C: Panaglagip ti surat** (Memory of letters/writing) - This is a detail *related to* memory, not a central outcome of the Renaissance itself.
* **D: Panangala ti impormasion** (Acquisition of information) - While the Renaissance certainly facilitated getting information, the passage emphasizes the *spreading* of that information (dissemination) as the key result.



"
"Kas resulta ti Renaissance, basbassit ti panangipaganetget iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **A: Panaglagip ti maysa** (Memorization of a person).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Saanen a makalagip ti tao gapu iti panangpilit, ngem ti kabaelan a makalagip ti surat ket maigapu iti naipamaysa nga atension."" (People don't memorize through force, but the ability to memorize text comes from focused attention.) This implies a *shift away* from rote memorization of facts (like remembering a person) and *towards* understanding and focused learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panang-ala ti pannakaammo** (Acquisition of knowledge) - The Renaissance *increased* the acquisition of knowledge.
* **C: Panaglagip ti surat** (Memorizing text) - The passage actually states that memorizing text is *enhanced* by attention, which is a positive outcome.
* **D: Panangiwaras ti impormasion** (Dissemination of information) -  The Renaissance *improved* the dissemination of information.



The Renaissance emphasized a more holistic and attentive approach to learning, moving away from simply forcing memorization. Therefore, the least emphasized aspect as a result of the Renaissance was rote memorization of individuals."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mangiyanninaw ti gandat ti panagusar ti internet para ti agtultuloy a pannakirelasion?,"The correct answer is **A: Panagnetwork ti negosio (Business networking)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights ""agtultuloy a pannakirelasion"" (ongoing relationships) as a *new* aspect of internet use, specifically in the context of how users *react* to websites. This suggests a focus on *personal* connections and maintaining existing bonds.

Let's look at the options:

*   **B: Agtalinaed a makikomunikar iti pamilia (Staying in communication with family)** - Directly supports ongoing relationships.
*   **C: Panagsirarak ti pasiar (Searching for information)** - While the internet facilitates this, it doesn't necessarily prioritize *relationship building*.
*   **D: Makiam-ammo kadagiti baro a tattao (Meeting new people)** - Can lead to ongoing relationships.
*   **A: Panagnetwork ti negosio (Business networking)** - While networking *is* a use of the internet, it's generally a more *transactional* relationship. It's about professional advancement, not necessarily the deep, ongoing personal connection that the passage highlights as a newer aspect of internet use.

Therefore, business networking is the least aligned with the concept of ""agtultuloy a pannakirelasion"" as described in the text.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mangiyanninaw ti gandat ti panagusar ti internet para ti personal a pannakikadua?,"The correct answer is **A: Kumita ti recipe**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how the internet fosters a sense of *community* and *identity*. It highlights concepts like ""social presence"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as emerging aspects of internet use.

Let's break down why the other options *do* relate to personal connection:

*   **B: Mangi-post ti online a pagsaritaan (Posting in an online forum):** This directly creates social interaction and a sense of belonging to a community.
*   **C: Panagsirarak ti produkto ti panangtaripato iti salun-at (Searching for health and wellness products):** While not directly social, seeking health information can be tied to self-identity and a desire to improve one's well-being, which are personal aspects.  You might join online communities focused on health.
*   **D: Mangimaton kadagiti pinansia (Managing finances):** This is increasingly done through online platforms that often offer personalized advice and tracking, creating a relationship between the user and the financial institution/tools.

*   **A: Kumita ti recipe (Finding a recipe):** This is a purely functional task.  It doesn't inherently involve social interaction, identity formation, or relationship building.  It's about obtaining information, not connecting with others or expressing oneself.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that *doesn't* align with the passage's emphasis on the internet's role in fostering personal connection and identity."
Kaano nga insardeng ti lumaud nga Europa iti agpannuray kadagiti impluensia ken nangrugi a mangbukel ti bukodda nga istilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti aglawlaw ti ngudo ti Middle Ages** (In the late Middle Ages).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Iti panagleppas ti Middle Ages, nangrugi a mangbukel ti lumaud nga Europa iti bukodda nga istilo."" (In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bayat ti panawen iti Byzantine** (During the Byzantine period) - The passage says early styles *were influenced* by Byzantine culture, but it doesn't say that's when Western Europe stopped following those influences.
* **C: Agarup 25 a tawen kalpasan ti Middle Ages** (About 25 years after the Middle Ages) - The passage doesn't mention a specific time *after* the Middle Ages.
* **D: Bayat ti maika-11 a siglo** (During the 11th century) - While the passage mentions the 10th-14th centuries, it specifically links the development of a unique Western European style to the *end* of the Middle Ages, not just the 11th century.



"
Ti panagusar iti butones a pangiserra iti badbado ket resulta ti ania? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti Krusada** (The Crusades).

The passage states: ""Maysa kadagiti kadadakkelan a nagdur-asan iti dayta a panawen a kas resulta dagiti krusada, nangrugi dagiti tattao nga agusar iti butones a pangiserra iti badbado."" This directly links the use of button closures to the Crusades.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maikonsiderar a solusion ti napaut a panawen kadagiti parikut iti aglawlaw?","The correct answer is **C: Ilasin ti puon dagiti parikut** (Identify the root of the problems).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""No saantayo a kayat ti temporario a solusion, mapantayo ngarud kitaen ti puon dagita problema, ket rumbeng nga intayo ida ikkaten.""  This directly translates to ""If we don't want a temporary solution, we should look at the root of the problems and address them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagboykot kadagiti nangina a keddeng ti panagbiag** (Boycotting extravagant lifestyles) - While the passage mentions extravagant lifestyles as *contributing* to the problems, it doesn't present boycotting as a *solution* itself.
*   **B: Aktibismo** (Activism) - Activism is mentioned as a way to *prevent* future problems (""ag-aktibista tapno ad-adda a maliklikan ti panagsagaba ti masakbayan""), not as a solution to existing ones.
*   **D: Mannakigayyem iti panaggaraw iti aglawlaw** (Adapting to the changes in the climate) -  The passage states adapting is something we *can* do, but it frames it as a short-term response, not a fundamental solution.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a solusion ti saan a maikonsiderar a panangagas ti kaduanna kadagiti parikut iti aglawlaw?","The correct answer is **C: Panangipeksa kadagiti opinion maipanggep dagiti nangina a keddeng ti panagbiag**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that simply expressing opinions about wasteful lifestyles (""kasla mangipasimudaag a panangagas ti kaduanna"") is a *temporary* solution. It argues for addressing the *root causes* of the problems instead.

Let's look at why the other options *are* considered solutions, even if potentially temporary:

*   **A: Makipaset ti aktibismo** - The passage mentions activism as a way to *prevent* future problems (""ag-aktibista tapno ad-adda a maliklikan ti panagsagaba ti masakbayan"").
*   **B: Ikkaten dagiti puon ti parikut** - The passage directly advocates for identifying and addressing the root causes (""rumbeng nga intayo ida ikkaten"").
*   **D: Agbiag nga makaay-ayo iti aglawlaw** - The passage encourages living in harmony with nature (""mabalintayo nga agbiag a mannakigayyem iti aglawlaw"").



Therefore, expressing opinions without taking action to address the underlying issues is the one option that the passage explicitly identifies as a less substantial, temporary approach."
Iti ania a nasion ti Europa ti nangimarka ti umuna a gubat a ti pakaseknanna ket ti balanse ti bileg imbes a relihioso ti kontekstona?,"The correct answer is **D: Espania**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Naimarka nga umuna a gubat ti Spanish Succession War a ti kangrunaan a pakaseknanna ket ti balanse ti bileg."" (Marked the first war whose primary concern was the balance of power.)

Therefore, the first war concerned with the balance of power was the Spanish Succession War, making Espania (Spain) the correct answer.



"
Ania a gubat ti nailadawan kas maudin a gubat kas ‘relihioso a gubat’?,"The correct answer is **A: Tallopulo a Tawen a Gubat**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Gapuna a ti Tallopulo a Tawen a Gubat ti maudin a gubat a maawagan a kas relihioso a gubat."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War is the last war to be called a religious war.)



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aspeto iti Simbaan Katoliko ti saan a naipasirok iti panangsukimat?,"The correct answer is **B: No ti kangrunaan a sursuro ti relihion ket rumbeng a mabaliwan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the core belief (kinabaknang ket masapul a mausar tapno mapalag-anan ti panagsagaba ken kinakurapay) was being questioned.** This means people *were* investigating if the central teaching was being followed.  Therefore, questioning if the core teaching could be changed is *not* something being investigated - it's the investigation *of* that teaching's application that is happening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No ti pannakabingbingay ti kinabaknang ti Simbaan ket naitutop:** The passage clearly indicates the wealth of the Church *was* being investigated (naipasirok iti panangsukimat).
* **C: Ti konsentrasion ti bileg iti uneg ti Simbaan:**  The passage mentions the power of the Church and how it affected all levels of society, and specifically points to Rome being the center of power, implying this concentration of power was also subject to scrutiny.
* **D: No ti kangrunaan a sursuro ti Simbaan ket masabet:** The passage suggests doubt about whether the Church's teachings were actually being followed (""adun ti agduadua no masursurot met laeng daytoy a sursuro""), meaning understanding and application of the core teaching were under investigation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti pinatay idiay Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a guardia**.

The text states: ""Maysa a miembro ti nariribuk nga ummong ti nangitag-ay iti ulo ti guardia ti ari a napapatay idiay Versailles..."" This directly translates to ""A member of the mob carried the head of the king's guard who was killed in Versailles...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa kadagiti aglaklako a babbai (One of the attacking women):** The text says a *member of the mob* carried the head, but doesn't say the woman herself was killed.
*   **B: Ari Louis XVI (King Louis XVI):** The text doesn't mention the king being killed at this point.
*   **C: Maysa a miembro ti ummong (A member of the mob):** While a member of the mob *carried* the head, the text specifies it was the head of a guard that was killed.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga inpilit ti ummong iti Ari ken Reyna?,"The correct answer is **B: Kellaat a panagruar manipud ti Versailles**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the mob *forced* the King and Queen to open the carriage doors (A).**
* **The passage states a member of the mob *displayed* the head of the guard (C).**  This isn't something they forced the royals to do, but rather a demonstration *to* them.
* **The passage states the group *returned* to Paris (D).** This is what happened, but it wasn’t forced upon them – they were escorted/forced to go, but the act of returning isn’t a demand.
* **The passage doesn't mention the mob forcing them to leave Versailles.** They were *brought* from Versailles to Paris, but the text doesn't say the mob demanded they *leave* Versailles initially.  The move to Paris was a consequence of the mob's actions and demands *after* they were already en route.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a resulta ti saan a gagangay a gubat iti baybay ti Britania?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti napateg a suplay ket saan a madanon** (Essential supplies are not reaching their destination).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The British naval blockade was *effective* at cutting off supplies.  Germany, in response, wanted to use unrestricted submarine warfare to achieve a similar effect – to cut off *Britain's* supplies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kayat nga imangmangged ti Germany ti pada a taktika ti pannakigubat** (Germany wanted to implement the same tactics of warfare) - This is *directly* stated in the passage as Germany's goal.
* **B: Nairaman ti peggad dagiti neutral a barko** (Neutral ships were caught in the crossfire) - The passage specifically mentions the British blockade endangered even neutral ships.
* **C: Inaramid dagiti panagbalbaliw iti internasional a linteg** (Changes were made to international law) - The passage explicitly states the British blockade *violated* accepted international law.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagserra ti baybay kontra Germany?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkontrana iti internasional a linteg** (Contradicts international law).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""daytoy a panagserra ilabsingna ti kangrunaan nga akseptado a internasional a linteg"" (this blockade violates fundamental accepted international law). This is the core issue raised about the British blockade.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Intignayna ti pagsayaatan ti submarino ti Germany** (Provoked Germany's submarine warfare) - While the blockade *led to* Germany using submarine warfare, it wasn't the primary description of the blockade itself. The passage suggests Germany responded *because* they couldn't effectively counter the blockade.
* **C: Naisardeng iti panagayus ti suplay iti Germany** (Interrupted the supply to Germany) - This is a *result* of the blockade, but not its defining characteristic.  Blockades generally *aim* to interrupt supply.
* **D: Siniguradona a saan a agpeggad dagiti neutral a barko** (Ensured that neutral ships would not be attacked) - The passage explicitly states the opposite: ""nangipoaay iti peggad uray kadagiti neutral a barko"" (posed a threat even to neutral ships).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti mabalin a maaddaan iti Multiple Sclerosis?","The correct answer is **A: Babai a 32 ti tawenna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states MS primarily affects young and middle-aged adults.** 32 falls within that age range.
* **The passage specifically mentions women are twice as likely to have MS as men.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lalaki a 15 ti tawenna** - 15 is too young; the passage focuses on young and *middle*-aged adults.
* **C: Lalaki a 43 ti tawenna** - While 43 is in the correct age range, the passage highlights women are more susceptible.
* **D: Babai a 10 ti tawenna** - 10 is too young; the passage focuses on young and *middle*-aged adults.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, dagiti tumabuno iti regular nga aktibidad ket kasapulanda ti ad-adu a suporta para ti?","The correct answer is **A: Negatibo a pannakaawat iti ut-ot**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti tumabuno iti regular nga aktibidad ket kasapulan ti ad-adu a suporta babaen ti **negatibo a pannakaawat iti ut-ot**..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iti makinbaba a likud:** The passage mentions lower back pain in relation to the study's focus, but doesn't say those who exercise *need* more support *for* it.
* **C: Depresion:** While depression is mentioned in the study, the passage specifies support is needed for negative perception of pain, not depression itself in active individuals.
* **D: Buteng:** Similar to depression, anxiety is discussed but isn't the direct reason active individuals require more support according to the text.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano ti kadawyan a pannakaay-ayam ti fencing?","The correct answer is **D: Iti duelo a pormat**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Daytoy nga isport ket kangrunaanen a maay-ayam iti duelo a pormat, maysa a fencer a makiduelo iti maysa pay."" (This sport is primarily played in a duel format, one fencer dueling another.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti moderno a pormat** - While true, this is a general statement and doesn't describe *how* it's played.
*   **B: Iti lebel ti unibersidad** - The passage mentions university students play, but it's not the *typical* way it's played.
*   **C: Iti lebel ti Olympic** - The passage mentions the Olympics, but this is a high level of competition, not the standard way fencing is played.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kangrunaan a pagilasinan ti pannakasabidong iti uneg?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a pagyanan ti agas**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ti kangrunaan a pagilasinan ti internal a pannakasabidong ket ti kaadda ti nakalukat a pagyanan ti agas wenno dagiti makasabidong a kemikal a maus-usar iti balay."" (The main indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open source of gas or poisonous chemicals used in the house.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagulaw ken gurigor (Sweating and trembling)** - These are *symptoms* of poisoning, but not the primary *indicator*.
*   **B: Panagsarua ken panagling-et (Dizziness and fever)** - Also *symptoms*, not the main indicator.
*   **C: Nakaro a panagpiskel ken sakit ti tian (Severe coughing and stomach ache)** - Again, *symptoms* that could be caused by many things, not specifically indicating internal poisoning.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maitutop nga umuna nga addang no sukimaten ti biktima?","The correct answer is **A: Kitaen ti nakapasamakan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Masapul a kitaen nga umuna ti nakapasamakanna tapno masigurado ti kinatalged."" (You must first see what happened to ensure safety.) This directly corresponds to option A.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiyanninaw ti proseso ti panangsukimat iti biktima?,"The correct answer is **A: Saanka maseknan a mangsustiner ti pannakadangranmo** (You should not risk your own injury).

Here's why:

* **P (the provided text) emphasizes safety first.** The passage states that if you feel unsafe attempting to help, you should *not* intervene, as it could worsen the situation.  Prioritizing your own safety is crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect, based on the passage:

* **B: Sukimaten nga umuna ti nakapasamakan sakbay ti biktima** (Assess what happened before the victim) - This *is* what the passage advises.
* **C: Paliiwem ti posision ti biktima** (Observe the victim's position) - This *is* also advised in the passage.
* **D: Padasem a padlawin ti aniaman a nalabbaga a bandera** (Pay attention to any red flags) - This is a good practice and aligns with the idea of assessing the situation, as mentioned in the passage.



"
Ania kadagiti panagbaliw nga intignay ti Rebolusion idiay Pransia ti dakkel ti epektona ken ti agtatrabaho a klase ti tattao?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagiyakar ti pokus aggapu iti klase mapan kinalaing** (Shift in focus from class to merit).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""gapu ta imbes a maibasar ti ranggo ti suldado iti klaseda ibasbasarda itan iti kalibre."" (because instead of a soldier's rank being based on class, it is now based on caliber/skill). This directly relates to a shift away from social class determining opportunity and towards individual merit.  This would have a huge impact on the working class, allowing talented individuals to rise regardless of their birth.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Manayonan a suporta para ti nasion (Increased support for the nation):** While nationalism *was* a result of the revolution, the passage doesn't specifically state it directly benefited the working class.
* **C: Panagsurot ti pammati a Republikan (Adoption of Republican beliefs):**  This is a significant outcome of the revolution, but the passage doesn't highlight *how* it specifically impacted the working class.
* **D: Baro a sistema ti panagsukat (New system of measurement):**  The metric system is mentioned, but its impact on the working class is not discussed. It's a general societal change, not one directly related to improving the lives of workers.



"
"Kalpasan ti Rebolusion idiay Pransia, ti balligi kadagiti militar ken dadduma a tarabaho ket basbassit ti posibilidadna a maibasar iti ania?","The correct answer is **B: Klase**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nangipaltiing iti Rebolusion idiay Pransia iti adu pay a dadduma a naidadanes nga agtatrabaho a klase ti tattao iti sabali a nasion tapno rugianda iti rebolusionda."" and ""imbes a maibasar ti ranggo ti suldado iti klaseda ibasbasarda itan iti kalibre.""  This directly indicates that before the revolution, military rank (and by extension, opportunities for working people) *was* based on **klase** (social class), and the revolution shifted that to be based on **kalibre** (skill/ability).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagragpat** - While the revolution involved upheaval, it doesn't say opportunities were previously based on loyalty.
*   **C: Ambision** - Ambition is presented as *enabled* by the revolution, not as a basis for opportunity before it.
*   **D: Kalibre** - Kalibre is what opportunities are based on *after* the revolution, not before.



"
Ania a serbisio a publiko ti makuna a pakaigapuan ti kaaduan a di pannakakontento idiay nababaknang a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **C: Sistema ti transportasion** (Transportation system).

The passage explicitly states that people constantly complain about the transportation system, even in wealthy countries where complaints about water quality or bridge deterioration are less frequent. This directly answers the question of which public service generates the most discontent.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania iti maibaga ti pampubliko a sistema ti transportasion?","The correct answer is **C: Kinagappuanda ti adu a reklamo dagiti mangusar.**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Dandani amin ket agreklamo maipapan iti sistema ti transportasion."" (Everyone complains about the transportation system). This directly supports the idea that public transportation systems receive a lot of complaints from users.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaykayat isuda ti amin a mangusar kaniada** (They want everyone to use them) - The passage doesn't mention the *desire* of the system, only that people *do* use them and complain.
*   **B: Saanda agpada ti kinadakes iti kalidad ti danum** (They don't have the same problems as water quality) - The passage uses water quality as a comparison, not as a statement about the transportation system itself.
*   **D: Libre isuda idiay kaadduan a nababaknang a pagilian** (They are free in most wealthy countries) - The passage doesn't say anything about whether transportation is free.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti narigat a rukoden gapu ti di mapakpakadaan nga ugali ti agmanmaneho?","The correct answer is **D: Agus ti trapiko**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""No man pay kasta, ti panagadal iti urnos ti trapiko ket narigat gapu iti ugali ti agmanmaneho ket sigurado a saan a mapugtuan iti sangagasut a porsiento.""  This directly translates to: ""However, the study of traffic flow is difficult because of driving habits which are certainly not 100% predictable.""  

The passage goes on to explain that while *completely* predicting is impossible, traffic *flow* (agus ti trapiko) can be modeled mathematically to a degree.  This makes the flow the thing most directly affected by unpredictable driver behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kinapartak ti trapiko (Traffic density):** While related to flow, the passage doesn't say density is *difficult to study* because of driving habits. It's a factor *in* the study.
*   **B: Panagplano ti kalsada (Road planning):** The relationships between flow, density and speed *help* with road planning.
*   **C: Dagiti operasion ti kalsada (Road operations):** Similar to planning, understanding traffic flow aids in road operations.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maus-usar no iladawan ti agus ti trapiko babaen iti matematika?,"The correct answer is **D: Kinaadu ti trapiko (Traffic Density)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Makatulong dagitoy a relasion [between flow, speed, and density] iti panagplano, disenio, ken panangpataray kadagiti pasilidad ti kalsada.""  It also mentions that traffic flow *can* be described mathematically *through* these relationships, particularly focusing on density as a key component.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti operasion ti kalsada (Road operations):** While important, road operations aren't directly *described* by mathematical models in the context of this passage.
* **B: Ugali ti agmanmaneho (Driver behavior):** The passage *acknowledges* that driver behavior is unpredictable and makes mathematical modeling difficult. It's not what's being *modeled* itself.
* **C: Disenio ti kalsada (Road design):** Road design *uses* the mathematical understanding of traffic flow, but isn't what's being mathematically described.



"
Ania ti inusar da Hershey ken Chase tapno maimulada ti bukodda a DNA? ,"The correct answer is **D: Birus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ni Hershey ken Chase ket nagusar ti mikrobio, wenno birus, tapno maimulada ti bukodda a DNA idiay bakteria."" (Hershey and Chase used a microbe, or virus, to inject their DNA into bacteria.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radioactive phosphorus:** While they *used* radioactive phosphorus to mark the DNA, the virus was the *tool* they used for injection.
*   **B: Genetiko a material:** This is what they were trying to prove DNA was, not what they used to inject it.
*   **C: Radioactive sulfur:** This was used to mark the protein, not the DNA itself.



"
Ti abilidad a maipatawid iti mutation iti anak ket depende iti ania?,"The correct answer is **A: No dagiti selula ket germ-line**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti laeng mutation ti selula iti germline ti mabalin a maipatawid kadagiti annak..."" (Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring...). This directly answers the question about what determines if a mutation can be inherited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kinapateg ti genetiko a materiales** - While important for *effect* of the mutation, it doesn't determine *inheritance*.
* **C: Klase ti mutation** -  The type of mutation influences the effect, but not whether it's passed on.
* **D: No ti mutation ket pakaigapuan ti pannakatay ti selula** -  This affects the organism, but doesn’t dictate whether it's inheritable.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, saan nga agpannuray ti nadumaduma nga epekto ti mutation iti ania?","The correct answer is **A: Kaadu ti naapektaran a genetiko a materiales**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the effects of mutations *depend* on:

*   **The class of mutation** (Klase ti mutation)
*   **The importance of the affected genetic material** (Kinapateg ti naapektaran a genetiko a materiales)
*   **Whether the affected cells are germline cells** (No ti naapektaran a selula ket germ-line)

The passage does *not* mention that the *amount* of genetic material affected influences the differing effects of mutations. It focuses on *what* material is affected and *where* (germline vs. other cells).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: No ti naapektaran a selula ket germ-line:** The passage specifically says this *does* influence the effects.
*   **C: Kinapateg ti naapektaran a genetiko a materiales:** The passage specifically says this *does* influence the effects.
*   **D: Klase ti naapektaran a mutation:** The passage specifically says this *does* influence the effects.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a rason a nangataraken ti kalding dagiti kadaanan a kultura?,"The correct answer is **B: Makatulongda nga agarab ti daga**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the reasons for domesticating goats were for:

*   **Gatas** (milk)
*   **Buok** (hair)
*   **Karne** (meat)
*   **Lalat** (skin/hide)

It does *not* mention goats being used to help plow/till the land (agarab ti daga).  The passage describes them as being herded like sheep, focusing on the resources they provide directly.

Therefore, option B is the one thing the text *doesn't* state as a reason for domesticating goats."
Ti panggep ti golf ket kabassitan ti bilang ti ania?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagtiro** (Shots/Strikes).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti agay-ayayam nga adda ti kabassitan a panagtirona, wenno panangindayonna iti dayta a malo, tapno makumpleto dayta kurso ket isu ti mangabak.""  This translates to ""The player with the fewest shots, or strokes, to complete the course is the winner.""

Therefore, the goal of golf is to have the *lowest number of shots*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bolbola (Ball)** - While important, the ball itself isn't the goal.
*   **C: Oras (Time)** - There's no mention of time being a factor in winning.
*   **D: Ab-abut (Holes)** - Completing the holes is *how* you play the game, but the *goal* is the lowest score (shots).



"
"Iti course ti golf, sadinno ti naab-ababa ti panagarbas ti ruot?","The correct answer is **B: Iti green**.

The passage states: ""Ti ruot iti aglawlaw ti abut ket maarbasan ket maawagan iti green."" (The grass on the surface of the hole is cut and is called the green.) This directly indicates that the grass is shortest on the green.



"
Ania ti kadawyan a gandat ti eksperimento?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapno maikkat ti maysa wenno ad-adu pay a mabalin a patta-patta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*maysa a pannubok ti eksperimento a mausar tapno maikkat ti maysa wenno ad-adu pay a mabalin a pattapatta...*""  This directly answers the question of what the common purpose of an experiment is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tapno maammuan no kasano ti panagandar ti lubong:** While science *aims* to understand how the world works, the experiment *itself* is a tool to test specific ideas, not to broadly understand everything.
* **C: Tapno masaludsod dagiti saludsod:**  Experiments can *lead* to further investigations, but that's not their primary purpose.
* **D: Tapno mangiturong ti nasientipikuan a panagsirarak:** Experiments guide research, but the primary goal is to test hypotheses, not just direct research generally.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a makatulong a mangiturong ti nasientipikuan a panagsirarak?","The correct answer is **B: Mangaramid dagiti kapaliiwan**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that the scientific method *guides* scientific inquiry. It involves observation, experimentation, testing hypotheses, and *leading to* further research.  It doesn't simply *make explanations* (kapaliiwan).  Explanations are the *result* of the method, not a guiding force within it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti pamay-an a sientipiko laeng** (The scientific method only) - The passage explicitly states the scientific method is fundamental and guides inquiry.
* **C: Panangikkat kadagiti mabalin a patta-patta** (Eliminating possible errors) - This is a *part* of the scientific method (testing hypotheses), so it *helps* guide inquiry.
* **D: Mangaramid dagiti eksperimento** (Doing experiments) -  Experimentation is a core component of the scientific method, and therefore guides scientific inquiry.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti ipu-ipo ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **C: Ti kaaduan ti ipu-ipo ket agpaut iti nasurok a tallo nga oras**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agpaut laeng iti nasurok a tallo nga oras ti dua porsiento kadagiti kararangragsan a tornado."" This means *only* 2% of tornadoes last more than three hours, not the majority.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ti ipu-ipo ket madadaelda ti aniaman a madalananda** - The passage says ""madadaelda ti aniaman a madalananda"" (can destroy anything in their path).
* **B: Ti ipu-ipo ket timmamtama iti basbassit a lugar kompara iti dadduma a bagyo** - The passage starts with ""Timmama dagiti ipu-ipo iti bassit a lugar kompara iti dadduma a naranggas a bagyo"" (Tornadoes occur in a small area compared to other storms).
* **D: Ti sumagmamano nga ipu-ipo ket addaan ti angin nga agingga ti 300 milia kada oras** - The passage says ""Dagiti nakaam-amak a bagyo ket addaan ti angin nga agingga ti 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).""



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti kaaduan dagiti ipu-ipo?","The correct answer is **A: Kadawyan nga agpautda iti nasurok a tallo nga oras**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agpaut laeng iti nasurok a tallo nga oras ti dua porsiento kadagiti kararangragsan a tornado."" This means the *majority* of tornadoes last for more than three hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agaramidda ti angin nga agingga ti 480 milia kada oras:**  The passage mentions this as the wind speed of *violent* tornadoes, not the average.
* **C: Maapektaranda iti dakdakkel a lugar kompara iti dadduma a bagyo:** The passage specifically says they affect *smaller* areas. (""Timmama dagiti ipu-ipo iti bassit a lugar kompara iti dadduma a naranggas a bagyo..."")
* **D: Parutenda dagiti kaykayo manipud iti daga:** This describes the *damage* tornadoes can do, but doesn’t describe how *most* tornadoes are.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti rugian nga usaren dagiti tattao idi maika-16 a siglo?,"The correct answer is **D: Mangaramid dagiti teleskopio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Naaramid ti immuna a teleskopio iti Europa idi arinunos ti maika-16 a siglo."" (The first telescope was made in Europe in the early 16th century.)  This directly answers the question of what people *began to do* in the 16th century – they began to make telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mangusar dagiti lente** - While they *used* lenses (as the first sentence states), the passage highlights the *making* of telescopes as the new development in the 16th century.
*   **B: Mangpadakkel dagiti bambanag** - They were *able* to magnify things with telescopes, but the passage focuses on the invention of the telescope itself.
*   **C: Mangaramid dagiti lente** - The passage doesn't say they started *making lenses* in the 16th century, only that lenses were *used* to make telescopes.



"
Kasano kabayag a mangpadpadakkel dagiti bambanag ti tattao babaen ti panangusar kadagiti lente?,"The correct answer is **B: Manipud iti arinunos ti maika-16 a siglo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Naaramid ti immuna a teleskopio iti Europa idi arinunos ti maika-16 a siglo. Agusar dagitoy a teleskopio iti kombinasion ti dua a lente tapno maipakita dagiti adayo a bambanag nga agpada a kas as-asideg ken dakdakkel.""  (The first telescope in Europe was made in the early 16th century. These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear as close and large.)

The question asks *when* people began using lenses to magnify objects. The passage specifically identifies the early 16th century as the starting point with the invention of the telescope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti sangaribu a tawen** (For thousands of years) - The passage doesn't indicate this long a history.
* **C: Iti rinibu-ribu a tawen** (For tens of thousands of years) -  Even further off than ""thousands of years.""
* **D: Manipud iti rugrugi ti maika-16 a siglo** (From the beginning of the 16th century) - While close, the passage says ""arinunos"" (early), making ""arinunos ti maika-16 a siglo"" more precise.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maibaga ti kueba ni Muhammad maipapan kadagiti espiritual nga aramid ken pategna?","The correct answer is **A: Ipatpategna ti kinatalna ken kinabukbukod** (It values his solitude and privacy).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""The cave itself, which still exists today, offers a clear indication of Muhammad's interest in spiritual matters."" and ""In its seclusion, it is difficult to feel like you are even there. If you are inside the cave, you always feel alone.""  This demonstrates the cave was a place for him to be alone and focus on spirituality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti arimbangaw idiay ruar ket makatulong ti panagmennamenna** (The sounds outside helped his meditation) - The passage emphasizes the *lack* of sound and external stimuli within the cave, creating a sense of isolation, not a helpful soundscape.
* **C: Kassapulanna ti bassit unay nga oras ti pagmaymaysa** (He needed only a short amount of time to be alone) - The passage doesn't mention the *duration* of his time in the cave, only the experience of being secluded.
* **D: Madanagan isuna a makakita ken makangngeg kaniana** (He easily saw and heard things) - The passage states the opposite - that it's difficult to feel present, and you see very little.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti umuna a nakapausaranna ti landok?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti crosstie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngem, napalutpot a namaymayat met laeng no adda ti landokna iti ngato."" (But it was discovered that it was better if it had a ridge on top). This refers to the crossties.  They initially used crossties to lay the tracks, and then realized adding a ridge (landok) improved their function, preventing the wood from rotting as quickly due to the carriage wheels. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti wagonway** - Wagonways used the crossties *with* the ridge, but didn't originate the use of the ridge itself.
*   **C: Dagiti pilid** - The wheels benefited from the ridge, but didn't *use* it first.
*   **D: Dagiti riles** - The first all-iron rails came much later (1767) - the text explicitly states this.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a nasuktan ti pilid a landok dagiti pilid a kayo?","The correct answer is **B: Nakonsiderarda nga ad-adda ti kabaelanna**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nagbalinen a gagangay nga aramid daytoy, ngem ti landok ti nakaigapu iti ad-adda a pannakarunot ti kayo a ligay dagiti karison."" This translates to ""This became a common practice, but the flange (landok) resulted in less friction of the wood against the carriages.""  Less friction means more efficiency and ability to carry heavier loads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inpatpangatoda ti kapartak dagiti kabalio** - The text doesn't mention anything about horse power.
*   **C: Kabaelanda nga awiten ti dakdakkel a karga** - While the landok *eventually* allowed for heavier loads, this wasn't the initial reason for its adoption. The first benefit was reduced friction.
*   **D: Mabanbannogda iti kalsada babaen ti landok** -  The text doesn't mention anything about the flanges helping with road conditions.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mangmuli kadagiti indibidual bayat ti panawen ti Romantisismo?","The correct answer is **B: Heograpiya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iti konteksto ti Romantisismo, ti **heograpiya ti mangmuli kadagiti indibidual a tattao**..."" (In the context of Romanticism, **geography shapes individuals**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Linlinteg (Laws)** - The passage contrasts geography with imposed laws, stating geography is *more* influential.
* **C: Kababalin (Personality)** - While personality plays a role in life, the passage specifically focuses on the influence of place.
* **D: Kultura (Culture)** - Culture *results* from the geographical influence, but geography is what initially shapes people.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a mangiyanninaw ti sapasap nga ideya ti teknolohikal a determinismo? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ti pagannayasan ti teknolohia ket saan a naimpluwensiaan ti kultura.**

Here's why:

* **Teknolohikal a determinismo** (as explained in the passage) emphasizes that technology development often *follows a path relatively independent of cultural or political influence*.  Option B directly contradicts this core idea. The passage states: ""a ti pannakaaramid ti teknolohiya ket sumursurot iti dalan a limmabes iti impluwensia ti kultura wenno pulitika..."" (that the creation of technology follows a path less influenced by culture or politics).

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Ti epekto ti teknolohia iti gimong ket nakundision iti gimong** - This aligns with the passage which states technology has ""effects"" on existing conditions, not creating them outright.
* **C: Ti teknolohia ket addaan dagiti nainkasigudan nga epekto iti gimong** - This reflects the idea that technology has inherent consequences, as illustrated by the example of cars leading to better roads and medical advancements.
* **D: Ti teknolohikal a pagannayasan ket saan a naibasar iti impluwensia ti pulitika** - Similar to option B, but regarding political influence, this is also in line with the passage’s main point.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mainaig ti panagguyod ti pana?","The correct answer is **A: Ti nakapkapsut nga uni**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""up bow"" as *creating* a ""nakapkapsut nga uni"" (a constricted/tight sound). It's a *result* of the up bow, not a way to *perform* the up or down bow. 

Let's look at why the other options are related to how the bow is moved:

* **B: Ti marka a kasla maysa nga staple** - This describes the visual representation of the down bow.
* **C: Ti napigpigsa nga uni** - This describes the sound produced by the down bow.
* **D: Mangrugi iti frog** - This explicitly states where to start for a down bow.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mainaig ti nakapkapsut nga uni?","The correct answer is **C: Ti marka a kasla V** (The mark like a V).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iti up-bow ket gagangay nga ag-araramid ti nakapkapsut nga uno..."" (In the up-bow it easily creates a soft sound...). And it describes the up-bow as looking like a ""V"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti marka a down bow** (The down bow mark) - The passage says the *down-bow* is tighter and stronger, not softer.
*   **B: Panagguyod ti pana** (Drawing the bow) - This is part of both up and down bows, so doesn’t specifically relate to a soft sound.
*   **D: Mangrugi idiay ayan ti pinangig-igemman ti imam ti pana** (Starting at the point where the frog is held) - This describes the *down-bow*, which results in a stronger sound.



"
Inpakita dagiti fossil a ti ima ket nakibagay met laeng nga para ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangpaandar (Manipulation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti fossil a tulang ti ima ket addaan iti dua a milion agingga iti tallo a milion a tawen a nangipalgak ti daytoy a pagbaliwan iti pannakaisansangayanna dayta ima agsipud iti panaggaraw agingga iti **panangpaandar**."" 

This directly translates to: ""Fossil hand bones, two to three million years old, show this change in hand development from foraging to **manipulation**.""

The passage emphasizes the *evolution* of the hand *towards* being able to manipulate objects, making ""panangpaandar"" the best answer.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti phalanges ti chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Mausarda ti panagsuporta ti dagsen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that chimpanzees have arms and legs of similar length, *suggesting* they use their arms to support their weight when knuckle-walking.  This means their phalanges (finger bones) are adapted for that purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nadirdiretsoda ngem kadagiti tao** - The passage states the *opposite*: the human hand has straighter bones.
*   **B: Ti ima ken saka da ket agduduma ti kadakkelda** -  The passage explicitly states their arms and legs are *similar* in length.
*   **D: Kangrunaan a mausarda ti panangpaandar** - The passage indicates human hands evolved *towards* being better for manipulation, while chimpanzee hands are better suited for support.



"
Ti panagpili ket ikkatenna ti genetiko a kinanadumaduma manipud iti ania a pool?,"The correct answer is **A: Nailemmeng** (Hidden).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti mutasion ket mangnaynayon ti genetiko a kinanaduma, ken ti panagpili ket mangik-ikkat kadagitoy iti pagpilyan."" (Mutation creates genetic diversity, and selection *removes* it from the population.)
* The passage contrasts ""nailemmeng"" (hidden) and ""makitkita"" (visible) genetic variations.  Selection acts on the *visible* traits, but the source of the diversity it acts *upon* comes from the underlying, often *hidden* genetic variations.  Those hidden variations are then potentially expressed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rekombinasion (Recombination):**  Recombination *creates* genetic diversity, it doesn't have diversity removed *from* it by selection.
* **C: Panaglalasin (Crossing Over):** Similar to recombination, crossing over is a mechanism for *creating* diversity, not a pool from which diversity is removed.
* **D: Makitkita (Visible):** Selection acts *on* visible traits, but the genetic diversity *originates* from the hidden, underlying genetics.



"
Ania a proseso iti responsable a manginayon ti genetiko a kinanadumaduma?,"The correct answer is **C: Mutasion**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Ti mutasion ket mangnaynayon ti genetiko a kinanaduma."" (Translation: Mutation introduces genetic variation.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panaglalasin (Selection):** Selection *acts on* existing variation, it doesn't *create* it.
* **B: Rekombinasion (Recombination):** Recombination shuffles existing genes, but doesn't create new genetic material.
* **D: Makitkita (Observable):** This describes a trait, not a process that generates variation.

"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti rumbeng a kanen ti primate tapno masolbar ti “problema ti protina”?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti dudon (Insects)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that animal foods (meat, termites, eggs) are not only easier to digest but also provide a high amount of protein *with all the necessary amino acids*.  This directly addresses the ""protein problem"" faced by primates in the savanna.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Natay a bulbulong (Dead leaves):** The passage specifically says leaves are *difficult* to digest.
*   **B: Naata a legumbres (Cooked legumes):** While legumes are a good source of protein, the passage focuses on the difficulty of digesting plant matter *without* cooking, and the benefit of animal protein being readily available.
*   **D: Dagiti pupuon ti sabong (Flower buds):** These aren't mentioned as a significant protein source in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a problema ti saan a gapo ti panagkurang ti pakasapulanna nga amino acid?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti prikut ti panagrunaw ti makan** (Digestive problems with food).

Here's why:

The passage states that primates in the savanna struggle to digest plant proteins *unless cooked*. This means difficulty *digesting* the food is a problem, but the passage directly links a *lack* of essential amino acids (due to the difficulty in digestion) to malnutrition, stunted growth, and death.  The passage frames digestive difficulty as the *cause* of the amino acid deficiency, not the problem itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Malnutrision:** The passage directly states malnutrition is a *result* of not getting enough amino acids.
* **C: Saan a panagdakkel:**  Stunted growth is also listed as a direct consequence.
* **D: Pannakatay:** Death is presented as a serious result of amino acid deficiency.



"
Kasano nga ipakita dagiti miembro iti partikular a subkultura ti asosasionda iti grupo?,"The correct answer is **D: Babaen ti panagusar iti istilo kas a porma ti simbolismo.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Masansan nga ipaduyakyak dagiti miembro ti subkultura ti kinamiembroda babaen ti mailasin ken simboliko a panagusar iti istilo, a pakairamanan dagiti uso nga aruaten, galad, ken pagsasao."" (Members of a subculture often express their membership through the distinct and symbolic use of style, including fashion trends, clothing, and language.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Babaen ti panangpadas a makilaok** (By trying to fit in) - This is the opposite of what subcultures do; they often *stand out*.
*   **B: Babaen ti panangsurot ti pammati dagiti amin nga adda iti aglawlawda** (By following the beliefs of everyone around them) - Subcultures often have distinct beliefs *different* from mainstream society.
*   **C: Babaen ti panangawat dagiti pagalagadan ti kagimongan** (By accepting the norms of society) - Subcultures often challenge or deviate from societal norms.

"Segun iti teorya nga inpresentar iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a mapasamak iti maysa nga ubing a malasin nga adda iti minoridad a rasa nga ipanangmatmat ti mamagpeggad a kababalin?","The correct answer is **A: Padasen adiay ubing a liklikan iti makipaset ti mamagpeggad a kababalin.**

Here's why:

The passage states that if a child of a minority race *internalizes* negative stereotypes about their race and their ability to succeed in school, they are more likely to *withdraw* from school.  ""Liklikan iti makipaset ti mamagpeggad a kababalin"" (to avoid participating in productive activities/life) aligns with this withdrawal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ad-adu ti posibilidadna a makipaset adiay ubing iti mamagpeggad a kababalin (The child is more likely to participate in productive activities):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
* **C: Umadayo adiay ubing kadagiti kasasaad ti kagimongan (The child will distance themselves from societal situations):** While withdrawal is a component, the passage focuses on school specifically as the area of impact.
* **D: Agkedked adiay ubing a makilangen kadagiti dadduma a minoridad a rasa (The child will seek to connect with other minority races):** The passage doesn't mention any inclination toward seeking out other minorities.  It focuses on the *internalized* effect of negative stereotypes.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti pannakaammo iti ubing ti panangmatmat iti rasa ket mabalin nga adda epektona iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **B: Ti kababalinda (Their self-esteem)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...and these perceptions of race can affect self-esteem."" ( ""...dagitoy a panangmatmat iti rasa ket makaapektar iti kababalin."")

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ti minoridad a rasa a pinilida a pakilasinan (The minority race they identify with):**  The passage talks about *perceptions* of race affecting self-esteem, not changing their racial identity.
* **C: Ti relasionda iti dadduma nga ubbing (Their relationship with other children):** While perceptions of race *could* influence relationships, the passage doesn't directly state this.
* **D: Ti depinasionda ti rasa (Their definition of race):** The passage focuses on how children *perceive* race, not how they *define* it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nalabit a maitunos iti pannakapadakkel ti feral nga ubbing?","The correct answer is **D: Panagdanag iti lawlaw ti adu a tao.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states feral children are *isolated* from people.** They are abandoned or lost and often raised without significant human contact.  Therefore, they would *not* be comfortable or accustomed to being around many people.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible based on the text:

* **A: Agwaywayas a panagbiag (A free life):**  While likely harsh, a feral child’s life would be free from societal constraints.
* **B: Nalaing ai pannakisarita (Good storytelling):**  The passage suggests they might learn behaviors *like* animals, which wouldn't include complex storytelling.
* **C: Ti pagannayasan nga agmaymaysa (A tendency to be alone):**  Due to their upbringing, feral children would naturally be solitary and avoid social interaction.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti feral a kababalin dagiti ubbing?","The correct answer is **B: Ti feral a kababalin ket mabalin nga aggapu ti kinakurang ti pannakilangen iti tao.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maysa kadagiti gagangay a sistema tapno maipakita ti kinapateg ti pannakilangen ket mangala kadagiti manmano a napaay a kasasaad dagiti ubbing a gapu iti panangbaybay-a, desgrasia, wenno panangabuso, saan a pinakelangenan iti nataengan bayat a dumakdakkelda."" This directly links feral behavior to a *lack of human contact* due to abandonment, misfortune, or abuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaaduan ti feral a kababalin ket gapo ti pisikal a pannakadadael** - While physical damage *can* be a factor (due to abuse or hardship), the passage doesn't say it's the *main* cause.
* **C: Ti feral a kababalin ket nasaknap laeng iti ubbing nga inkulong dagiti nagannakda** - The passage mentions abandonment *by* parents, but also notes children found after being lost or abused, not necessarily those locked away.
* **D: Amin a feral a kababalin ket gapu ti nakaro a panagbaldado iti panunot** - The passage suggests severe mental damage *can* be a reason for abandonment, but it doesn't say it's the sole or universal cause of feral behavior.  It also describes behaviors mimicking animals even without explicit mention of brain damage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aramid ti saan nga agtunos iti subsistence nga agrikultura?","The correct answer is **B: Mangapit ti taraon nga ilako kadagiti dadduma (To harvest food for sale to others)**.

Here's why:

* **Subsistence agriculture** is defined as farming *primarily* for the needs of the farmer and their family. The text explicitly states it's for ""pannakapataud ti makaanay a taraon a para laeng iti kasapulan ti mannalon ken ti pamiliana"" (producing enough food only for the needs of the farmer and their family).

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with subsistence agriculture:

* **A: Agwanawan laeng iti maysa nga apit para iti kasapulan ti mannalon ken ti pamiliana (To harvest only one crop for the needs of the farmer and their family)** - This aligns with the definition.
* **C: Agwanawan iti apit nga adu kas maisupadi iti naiyuna a teknik (To harvest a lot of crops as a result of using old techniques)** - While it mentions a larger harvest, it's still within the context of providing for the family, especially if those techniques are aimed at maximizing yield for personal consumption.
* **D: Mangted iti bukbukel a lokal idiay lugar ti mannalon (To plant local seeds in the farmer's area)** - This also fits the description of using native seeds.



Therefore, selling crops to others goes *against* the core principle of subsistence farming."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti aramid ti subsistence nga agrikultura?,"The correct answer is **A: Intero nga organiko iti sistema**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti subsistence nga agrukultura ket maysa a simple, kaaduansa nga organiko, a sistema..."" (Subsistence agriculture is a simple, mostly organic system...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Us-usarenna ti naiduma a teknik tapno mapaadu ti apit:** While the passage mentions crop rotation and *simple* techniques to increase yield, it doesn't say it uses *diverse* techniques.
* **C: Pagbalinenna dagiti agrikulturalista nga agiparabur ti apit iti intero a rehion:** Subsistence agriculture is about self-sufficiency for the farmer and family, not large-scale production for a region.
* **D: Us-usaren pay laeng daytoy dagiti mannalon iti dadduma a nasion:**  The passage states it *still* exists in many developing countries, but doesn't say it's *only* used there.



"
Ti panagbisita ti museo ket mairaman iti ania a kategoria ti turismo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kultural a turismo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that **kultural a turismo** involves visiting a place to learn about its history and culture. Visiting a museum is directly related to learning about history and culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Negosio a turismo:** This involves travel for work-related purposes.
*   **B: Panaglinglingay a turismo:** While museums can be *part* of a recreational trip, the primary focus of recreational tourism is relaxation and enjoyment, not necessarily learning about culture.
*   **D: Iti ruar a turismo:** This isn't a defined type of tourism in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti prioridad dagiti managlinglingay a turista?","The correct answer is **B: Agsardeng ti gagangay nga inaldaw nga aktibidadda.**

Here's why:

The passage states that recreational tourism is ""panagpasiar dagiti tattao iti maysa a lugar a **naiduma unay iti gagangay nga inaldaw nga aktibidadda** tapno agrelaks ken agragsakda."" (visiting places **different from their daily routines** to relax and have fun).  This clearly indicates that escaping their daily lives is the priority for recreational tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapadasan da iti lokal a kultura** - The passage describes *cultural* tourism as focusing on local culture, not recreational tourism.
*   **C: Makakita ti napateg a landmark** - While tourists *can* visit landmarks, it isn't the defining priority of recreational tourism.
*   **D: Maawatan iti napalabas ti maysa a lugar** - This is the priority of *cultural* tourism, not recreational tourism.

Ania ti nadakamat iti mabasa a banag a nakatulong a mangkissay ti panagamak iti panagbalbaliw iti uneg ti lokal a simbaan?,"The correct answer is **A: Pananglagip iti napalabas a balligi ti garaw ti panagnegosio** (Remembering the past values of the business model).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ti pananglagip iti napalabas a garaw ti panagnegosio ken dagiti balligi ket nakatulong kadagiti tattao nga agbalin a nakalukat kadagiti baro a panagbaliw ken baro a turong para iti lokal a simbaan.""  This directly connects remembering past values to being open to change and new directions.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

*   **B: Pannakaawat kadagiti tattao a nangiturturong iti kultura ti organisasion** (Understanding the people who influenced the organizational culture) - While important, the passage doesn't state this *specifically* helps with embracing change. It helps understand the *why* behind things, but not necessarily the *how* to change.
*   **C: Panagdiskubre kadagiti mangtignay ti puersa ti organisasion** (Discovering the forces that drive the organization) - This is related to understanding the organization, but not the catalyst for change itself.
*   **D: Maawatan iti pakasaritaan ti organisasion** (Understanding the history of the organization) - Understanding history is helpful, but the passage highlights *remembering the values* as the key to adapting.

"Segun iti mabasa, ti makagun-od iti pannakaawat ti bukod a pakasaritaan ti maysa a tao ket makatulong iti ania?","The correct answer is **C: Mangbirok ti rikna ti nakaibatuganda iti uneg ti organisasion.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bayat a tartarusam ti pakasaritaan ti maysa saanmo nga ipagarup a matarusam met ti kultura, ngem makatulong met kadagiti tattao a makagun-od iti rikna no sadino ti nakaibatuganda ti pakasaritaan ti organisasion.""  This directly translates to understanding where the organization's history has roots.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mangkissay iti panagamak iti panagbalbaliw** - While the passage mentions preparing for change, it doesn't state that understanding history *directly* accomplishes this. It's a *result* of understanding history.
*   **B: Manangpapigsa dagiti pateg** -  The passage mentions discovering values, but it's a byproduct of exploring history, not the primary benefit of understanding it.
*   **D: Mangpasayaat ti garaw ti panagnegosio** - The passage mentions improving the way of doing business as a *result* of remembering the past, but it's not the core benefit of understanding the history itself.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiyanninaw ti postmodern approach iti panagadal?,"The correct answer is **D: Awan ti absoluto iti panagsursuro** (There is no absolute in learning).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Awan ti maymaysa a dalan iti panagsursuro. Kinapudnona, awan ti uray maysa laeng a naimbag a banag a masursuro."" This directly translates to ""There is no single way to learn. Furthermore, there isn't even one single good thing to learn."" This embodies the core postmodern idea that there are no universal truths or absolute standards in education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti sumagmamano a padas iti panagsursuro ket ad-adda a makagunggona ngem iti dadduma** (Some methods of teaching are more effective than others) - This suggests a hierarchy of quality, which contradicts the postmodern rejection of absolute standards.
* **B: Ti panagsursuro ket rumbeng a nakapokus kadagiti bambanag a patientayo a mapasarantayo** (Learning should focus on things we are interested in) - While interest is important, the passage doesn't focus on *what* we learn, but the *nature* of learning itself.
* **C: Ti sumagmamano a wagas ti panagadal ket maymayat ngem iti dadduma** (Some ways of learning are better than others) - Similar to A, this implies a ranking of learning methods, conflicting with the postmodern perspective.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiyanninaw ti postmodern approach iti panagadal?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti pannakaammo a saantayo a maiyaplikar ket maikari a masursuro latta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that there's no single ""good"" thing to learn.** It highlights how easily we consume information passively (watching TV shows about things we'll never *do*). This directly supports the idea that knowledge for knowledge's sake, even if impractical, is still considered learning within a postmodern framework.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Adu dagiti wagas ti panagadal ti impormasion (There are many ways to study information)** - While true, this is a general statement and doesn't capture the *specific* postmodern idea presented in the passage.
* **B: Ti sumagmamano a padas iti panagsursuro ket rumbeng a maipangpangruna ngem iti dadduma (Some learning methods are more important than others)** - The passage argues *against* prioritizing specific methods, stating there isn't a single ""right"" way to learn.
* **C: Ti padas iti panagsursuro ket agpannuray iti agsursuro ken ti pannakaammo a naipresentar (Learning depends on the teacher and the information presented)** - This is close, but the passage focuses more on the *consumption* of information and its disconnect from practical application, rather than the dynamics between teacher and learner.

"Kalpasan ti sipapakinakem a panagriing bayat ti tiempo ti normal a panagturog, ania kadagitoy ti sumampitaw ti proseso ti pannakaistorbo ti panagturog?","The correct answer is **B: Panangusar ti banio ken panagsubli a dagus iti pagiddaan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti pannakaistorbo iti panagturog ket ti proseso a panangpilit ti panagriing iti tiempo ti normal a pannaturog ken pannaturog manen iti apagbiit (manipud 10 agingga iti 60 a minuto).""  Using the bathroom and immediately returning to bed fits this description - a brief waking period and then trying to fall back asleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagbasa iti maysa ket kagudua nga oras sakbay ti pannaturog manen** - This describes a longer period of wakefulness, not the brief interruption defined in the passage.
* **C: Panangiddep ti alarma idiay nightstand-mo ken panagturog manen iti duapulo a minuto kalpasanna** - While the passage mentions alarms, this focuses on *setting* the alarm, not the act of being briefly awakened.
* **D: Panagriing tapno uminum iti danum a manipud iti botelia idiay nightstand-mo** - The passage mentions drinking fluids *before* sleep to delay waking, not as part of the wake-up/sleep-again cycle of sleep interruption.



"

* **The passage states:** ""Ti pannakaistorbo iti panagturog ket ti proseso a panangpilit ti panagriing iti tiempo ti normal a pannaturog ken pannaturog manen iti apagbiit (manipud 10 agingga iti 60 a minuto).""  This means re-sleeping happens within 10-60 minutes, *not* up to two hours.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions according to the text:

* **A: Mabalin a nakabasar iti biorythm:** The passage mentions biorythm-based methods like drinking fluids before bed.
* **B: Ti panggep ket saan a naan-anay a riingem ti bagim:**  The passage describes a gentle alarm that doesn't violently wake you.
* **C: Ti proseso ket mapasamak bayat ti tiempo ti normal a panagturogmo:** The passage defines sleep interruption as occurring *during* normal sleep time.

"Kas ti panagpadas ti utek ti masansan a nalaka a maawatan a tagtagainep, ania iti umadu?","The correct answer is **D: Oras ti nagbaetan dagiti estado ti REM** (Time between REM states).

Here's why:

The passage states the main reason for the phenomenon (feeling tired despite sleeping) is ""the result of frequent dreams occurring in a short time between REM states.""  This directly links increased tiredness to *how often* REM states are interrupted and the *short duration* between them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagup dagiti estado ti REM** (Total number of REM states) - While REM is important, the *frequency* and *spacing* of REM states are the issue, not just the total number.
*   **B: Dagiti lebel ti pigsa** (Levels of stress) - Stress isn't mentioned as a direct cause in the passage.
*   **C: Kaatiddog ti estado ti panagpalaing** (Length of deep sleep state) - The passage focuses on REM sleep, not deep sleep.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a negatibo nga epekto nga adda iti bagi ti masansan a nalaka a maawatan a tagtagainep?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangkissay ti kaatiddog ti oras ti nagbaetan dagiti estado ti REM**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti kangrunaan a rason ti daytoy a penomenon ket ti resulta dagiti **nauneg a tagtagainep nga agwaras iti kaatiddog ti oras ti nagbaetan ti estado ti REM**."" (The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of frequent dreams interfering with the length of time between REM states.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangkissay dagiti REM kada rabii** - The passage states REM *happens* multiple times a night, not that it's reduced.
* **C: Panagpannuray iti nalaka a maawatan a tagtagainep** - The passage describes the dream itself as the problem, not worrying about it.
* **D: Panagadu dagiti REM kada rabii** - The passage doesn’t mention an *increase* in REM, but rather interference with their natural timing.

"Segun iti mabasa, kasano nga agpada dagiti gagangay a grupo ken birtual a grupo?","The correct answer is **A: Agpadada a manamnama a mangaramid iti agpada a lebel**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti pinartuat a grupo ket addaan iti agpada a pagalagadan a kas gagangay a grupo..."" This directly translates to ""Created groups have the same standards as traditional groups..."" meaning they are expected to perform at the same level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agpadada nga agduduma ti lebel ti autonomiada iti inaldaw-aldaw a rutina** - The passage actually *highlights a difference* in autonomy, stating virtual groups can operate across time zones which might not be understood by local managers.
* **C: Agpadada nga agipadamag iti saan a makitkita a manangimaton a grupo** - While the passage discusses the ""invisible group,"" it doesn't state that *both* traditional and virtual groups operate with one. It's presented as a characteristic *of* virtual groups.
* **D: Agpadada nga agtrabaho iti agpada a time zone** - The passage specifically points out that virtual groups often *don't* work in the same time zone, which is a key difference.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng a maipapan kadagiti pisikal ken birtual a grupo ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **C: Ti gagangay a grupo ket basbassit ti autonomiada ngem ti birtual a grupo.**

Here's why:

The passage states that virtual groups *can* adjust schedules based on different time zones, something a local manager might not be able to accommodate. This implies **more** autonomy for the virtual group, not less. The passage also states virtual groups act *as a point of contact* for the physical groups, meaning the physical group has more authority.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Ti gagangay a grupo ket kadawyan a tenglen ti nangatngato a pagalagadan** - The passage says both have similar standards.
*   **B: Ti birtual a grupo ket agtrabtrabaho a kas punto ti panagsarita para kadagiti gagangay a grupo** - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **D: Ti agduduma a time zone ket mabalin a pagunggonaan dagiti birtual a grupo** - The passage explicitly mentions this as a challenge for virtual groups.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a banag a naisentroan dagiti content a teorya?,"The correct answer is **B: Kasano a tignayen ti aglawlaw dagiti garawda.**

Here's why:

* **Content theories** focus on *what* motivates people – their needs, desires, and what makes them satisfied. They try to understand *why* people want things.
* The passage explicitly states content theories center on ""ania ti makatignay kadagiti tattao wenno no ania ti magustuanda"" (what motivates people or what they like) and ""no ania ti panggep dagiti tattao a mangpabalin kadakuada a mangayat kadagiti bambanag a kayatda"" (what people think that makes them like things they want).

Let's look at why the other options are *part* of what content theories cover:

* **A: Dagiti baro a tarigagay a makairuaman ti panagtaeng (New factors that affect life):** Content theories often identify new or evolving needs.
* **C: Nainternalisa a kasapulan (Internalized needs):**  Understanding internalized needs is central to content theories.
* **D: Panangtarus dagiti kagustuan ti tattao (Understanding people's desires):** This is a direct focus of content theories.

Option B, however, focuses on *how* the environment affects behavior (how the surroundings influence actions). This is more the domain of **process theories** of motivation, which deal with the *cognitive processes* that affect motivation, rather than the underlying *content* of those motivations.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a banag ti annuroten dagiti maikatlo?,"The correct answer is **A: Agparnuay ti linia a batayan ti pangikabilan ti kangrunaan a banag**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the rule of thirds is a *guide to achieving dynamism while positioning the subject within the image*. It *doesn't* dictate *how* to position the lines themselves, but rather how to use them to place the main subject.  The passage focuses on the intersection of the lines as the strongest point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agparnuay ti biag ken pigsa iti uneg ti imahen** - While the rule of thirds *can* contribute to a more lively and impactful image, it's not directly about ""measuring"" life and intensity.
* **C: Pagtalinaeden a ti kangrunaan a banag ket idiay naisalumina ken epektibo a lugar** -  This is a *result* of using the rule of thirds, not the rule itself. The rule *suggests* this, but doesn't define it.
* **D: Mangrukod iti kinaurnos ti uneg ti ladawan** - This is a general statement about composition, but not specific to the rule of thirds.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mangiladawan ti panangretrato a 35mm ti format na?,"The correct answer is **C: Addaan dayta iti naiduma nga aspect ratio ngem iti adu a gagangay a format.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Adu a gagangay a format (pamilia ti format nga APS, kas pagarigan) ket maipada wenno asideg a mainaig iti daytoy nga aspect ratio."" (Many popular formats...are similar or closely related to this aspect ratio).

Therefore, the statement that 35mm has a *different* aspect ratio than many popular formats is **incorrect** and the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maparpartuat pay laeng ita** - The passage explicitly says ""Maparpartuat pay laeng agingga ita"" (It is still produced today).
* **B: Sinurot isuda ti kamera a digital dagiti format** - The passage states ""ti aspect ratio ket natawid dagiti pormat ti image sensor ti kamera a digital"" (the aspect ratio exceeds the image sensor formats of digital cameras), meaning digital cameras *adapted* to the 35mm format, not the other way around.
* **D: Isu ti kagagangay a format iti lubong** - The passage states ""ti gagangay a porma ti film ti retrato iti intero a lubong ket 35mm"" (the most popular film format in the world is 35mm).

"Segun iti mabasa, bayat ti panangpangato ti agpatpataud ti kalidad ti produksion ti lente, kasano a napsayaat dagiti lente ti zoom?","The correct answer is **A: Addanda ti nangatngato a kapartak ti lente**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saanen a dakkel nga isyu daytoy ta talaga a sumaysayaaten ti pannakaaramid dagiti lens. Impalubos daytoy a makaparnuay dagiti lente a pangpaadayo kadagiti litrato a dekalidad kompara kadagiti lente nga addaan di makuti a kaadayo ti pokusna.""

This means improvements in lens manufacturing *allow* zoom lenses to produce high-quality images comparable to prime lenses (lenses with a fixed focal length). This improvement in quality is a result of advancements in the *complexity* of the lens, not simplicity. Therefore, the answer is higher lens precision/quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nalaklakada nga usaren iti saan unay a nalawag a kondision** - The passage actually states zoom lenses can be *more difficult* to use in low light.
*   **C: Ti kalidadda ti ladawan ket umasping iti lente nga addaan ti di makuti a kaadayo ti pokusna** - The passage explicitly states zoom lenses are improving *to match* the quality of prime lenses.
*   **D: Basbassit ti kinakumplikado ti pokusna ngem kadagiti primo a lente** - The passage states the opposite - zoom lenses are *more* complex.



"
"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, kaano a nasaysayaat ti lente ti zoom ngem ti primo a lente?","The correct answer is **D: No agsapsapulka ti nakumkumplikado a pokus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti saan a dakkel nga isyu daytoy ta talaga a sumaysayaaten ti pannakaaramid dagiti lens. Impalubos daytoy a makaparnuay dagiti lente a pangpaadayo kadagiti litrato a dekalidad kompara kadagiti lente nga addaan di makuti a kaadayo ti pokusna.""  This directly translates to: ""It's not a big issue because lens manufacturing has really improved. This allows zoom lenses to capture high-quality photos compared to lenses with a fixed focal length.""

The passage highlights that the complexity of focus in zoom lenses (which was once a disadvantage) has been overcome through better manufacturing, leading to better image quality.  The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A:** The passage says zoom lenses often *have* smaller maximum apertures, not that they are better in this regard.
*   **B:** Zoom lenses *have more* elements, not fewer.
*   **C:** The passage explains that low-light performance is *worse* with zoom lenses due to smaller apertures, requiring a flash.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a nakanatad a panangiladawan ti Mistisismo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti panagpaganetget iti direkta a personal a kapadasan ket maipada iti dadduma pay a klase ti relihioso a pammati ken panagdayaw.**

Here's why:

The provided text *specifically states* that mysticism is **distinguished** from other forms of religious belief and worship *by its emphasis on direct personal experience* of altered states of consciousness.  Option D claims it's *similar* to other forms, which directly contradicts the definition given.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and therefore *not* the answer:

*   **A: Addaan ti panagpaganetgetna iti natalna ken naragsak nga estado ti kapuotan** - The text explicitly mentions seeking states of bliss, joy, and even ecstatic experience as characteristic of mysticism.
*   **B: Dagiti mamati ti Mistisismo ket agsapsapul ti siririing a kapuotan ti espiritual a kinapudno** -  The text states mystics seek direct knowledge and understanding of ultimate reality/the divine.
*   **C: Dagiti mamati ti Mistisismo ket mabalin nga anamongan dagiti aramid a makatulong a mangtaraken iti pannakaawatda iti realidad ti dibinidad** - The text states followers engage in practices to achieve those experiences.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a pokus ti Mistisismo?","The correct answer is **B: Panangsurot iti pannakaawat babaen kadagiti nabingbingay, komunal a padas.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mysticism is characterized by a *direct, personal experience* of the divine. It contrasts this with other forms of religious belief and worship.  ""Nabingbingay, komunal a padas"" (shared, communal experiences) is the opposite of a direct, personal experience. Mysticism emphasizes individual connection and understanding, not reliance on group interpretations or experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Panagsapsapul ti intuision ti realidad ti dibinidad** - The passage mentions seeking ""direkta a kapapadasan, kapanunotan"" (direct experience, understanding) of ultimate reality/divinity.
* **C: Ti panagpaganetget iti naragsak nga estado ti kapuotan** - The passage states mysticism involves seeking altered states of consciousness, including ""naragsak"" (joyful).
* **D: Panangsurot ti siririing a kapuotan ti Dios** -  The passage refers to seeking knowledge of ""Dios"" (God) through personal experience and intuition.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti nangrugi ti kagimongan ti agrikultura?","The correct answer is **A: Moriori a naggapu iti New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial theory suggested the Maori were the first settlers who developed agriculture. However, it *then* says the new evidence points to the Moriori being a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand and *developed their own distinct culture* on the Chatham Islands. This implies they were the ones who established the agricultural society in that region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moriori a naggapu iti Isla ti Chatham:** While they *lived* on the Chatham Islands, they *originated* from New Zealand and developed their culture there.
*   **C: Tattao a Maori a naggapu iti Polynesia:** The passage discusses the Maori origin from Polynesia, but it's the Moriori who are specifically linked to developing the agricultural society.
*   **D: Tattao a Maori a naggapu iti mainland:** This is too broad. It's the *Moriori*, a specific group *from* the mainland Maori, who are identified as the ones who initiated agriculture in the Chatham Islands.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti grupo a naganup kadagiti moa ket immun-una a nagtalinaed ti ania a lokasion?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iti nabayag a tawen iti maikasangapulo ket siam ken maikaduapulo a siglo, pattien a dagiti immun-una a nagtalinaed idiay New Zealand ket dagiti Maori, a naganup kadagiti higante a billit a maawagan moa.""  This directly translates to: ""For many years in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of **New Zealand** were the Maori, who hunted the giant birds called moa."" 

The passage then goes on to discuss the Moriori and their relationship to the Maori, but *initially* the hunting of the moa is attributed to the first inhabitants of **New Zealand**.



"
Iti ania nga eksena a ti panangusar iti wagas a Pureland ti origami ket mangbenepisio ti nagkupin?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti agkupkupin ket naminsan wenno namindua laeng a pinadas dayta sakbayna.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Inaramid daytoy ni John Smith idi 1970s tapno matulungan dagiti awan padasna ti panagkupin wenno dagiti saan unay a makagaraw."" This means the Pureland method was designed for people with limited dexterity or experience. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti agkupkupin ket ipangpangrunana ti mangaramid ti adu a kulpi iti mammaminsan.**  Pureland origami *limits* the number of folds, it doesn't focus on making many folds.
* **B: Ti agkupkupin ket addaan ti naiyuna a panaggaraw.** The passage focuses on helping those *without* prior experience.
* **C: Ti agkupkupin ket agararmid ti origami a kasapulan ti pabaliktad a kulkulpi.** The passage specifically says reverse folds are *not* allowed in Pureland origami.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti Pureland origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Nairanta daytoy para kadagiti agkupin nga adu padasna**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Pureland origami was *designed to help those with limited dexterity or who are not very skilled*. This means it's **not** for those who are already experienced folders (""adu padasna"").

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Atoy wagas ket saan a nangiraman kadagiti pabaliktad a kulpi:** The passage says complex folds like reverse folds are not allowed.
* **C: Dagiti kulpi ket addaan ti diretso a lokasion:** The passage states all folds have straight locations.
* **D: Nasayaat a wagas dayta para dagiti agkupin a saan unay a makagaraw:** The passage directly states it was created to help those less skilled.



"
"Segun iti paset, ania a lokasion ti saan a mainaig ti Sibilisasion iti Indus Valley?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""…naipasurot iti Harappa, a ti umuna kadagiti pakasarakan iti daytoy ket a nakali idi 1920."" This means Harappa is *where* the civilization was *first discovered*, not a location it doesn't relate to. In fact, the civilization is sometimes called the Harappan civilization *because* of this discovery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Karayan Sarasvati:** The passage mentions debate about whether to call it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization.
* **C: Amin a rehiyon iti aminanan-daya ti Afghanistan:** The passage explicitly states the civilization covered regions in northeast Afghanistan.
* **D: Adu a moderno a panawen a Pakistan:** The passage says the civilization covered much of modern-day Pakistan.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat a posible a nagan para iti Panawen ti Bronse a napagsasaritaan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sibilisasion iti Harappan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""idinto nga awagan dagiti dadduma a kas Sibilisasion ti Harappan a naipasurot iti Harappa, a ti umuna kadagiti pakasarakan iti daytoy ket a nakali idi 1920."" This means ""Harappan Civilization"" *is* a name used for this civilization.

* **The passage also mentions:**
    * **Sibilisasion iti Indus Valley** (Indus Valley Civilization)
    * **Sibilisasion iti Indus-Sarasvati** (Indus-Sarasvati Civilization)
    * **Sibilisasion iti Karayan ti Indus** (Indus River Civilization)

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned as a possible name is ""Sibilisasion iti Harappan"" despite being the origin of the name.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangapit ti napaut a panawen a benepisio?","The correct answer is **B: Panangipangruna ti bukod nga interes** (Prioritizing one's own interests).

Here's why:

* **P's core idea:** The passage states that true well-being and independence come from prioritizing individual action and pursuing what benefits *you*, even if it means going against the crowd.  It suggests that collective action often leads to diminished returns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pannakipaset kadagiti dadduma** (Participating with others) - The passage *contrasts* this, arguing against the benefits of collective action.
* **C: Panagpaganetget no ania ti makagunggona iti minoria ngem iti kaaduan** (Striving for what benefits the minority over the majority) - While it touches on being different, the passage isn't specifically about benefiting a minority; it's about benefiting *yourself*.
* **D: Panangbigbig a ti kinaagum ket mabalin a makagunggona** (Asserting that unity can be beneficial) - The passage actively argues *against* the benefits of unity when it comes at the expense of individual pursuits.



Therefore, **B** best reflects the core message of the passage – the idea that focusing on one's own interests and independence ultimately leads to greater well-being."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mabalin nga ipangpangruna ti maysa no ti pokusda ket dagiti dagus a pagimbagan?","The correct answer is **A: Kinaawan ti panagimbubukodan (Lack of self-reliance)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...the root of misery and dependence is the ingrained habit of relying on others, so that the more one relies on others, the more easily one is exploited."" This directly points to a negative consequence of *not* being self-reliant.  The passage emphasizes that constantly depending on others leads to vulnerability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagtitinnulong (Cooperation):** The passage is *against* constant reliance on others, not advocating for cooperation.
* **C: Panagkakadua (Togetherness):** While the passage acknowledges being with others, it highlights the danger of *excessive* reliance within those relationships.
* **D: Kinamanagimbubukod (Dependence):**  The passage identifies dependence as the *problem*, not something to prioritize.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti nangsaklaw iti dakkel a paset dagiti gastos iti gubat?","The correct answer is **D: Ti umili a Pilipino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Napilitanda nga agbayad kadagiti buis iti kolonial a turay ti Estados Unidos tapno mabayadan ti kadakkelan a paset dagiti gastos ken dagiti interes kadagiti bono..."" This directly translates to ""They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial government to pay for the largest part of the expenses and interest on the bonds...""  Therefore, the Filipino people were the ones who covered the majority of the war costs through taxes.



"
Ania a periodo ti panawen ti dimteng sakbay ti panawen dagiti Templar?,"The correct answer is **C: Tawtawen a Early Middle Age**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dagiti tawtawen a High Middle Age ket inunaan dagiti tawtawen nga Early Middle ken sinaruno dagiti tawtawen a Late Middle...""  This translates to ""The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages...""

Therefore, the period *before* the time of the Templars (which falls within the High Middle Ages) was the Early Middle Ages.



"
Ania a periodo ti panawen ti dimteng kalpasan ti panawen dagiti Templar?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Late Middle Ages**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dagiti tawtawen a High Middle Age ket sinaruno dagiti tawtawen a Late Middle, a nagleppas idi 1500."" (The High Middle Ages were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500).  Since the Templars existed *during* the High Middle Ages, the period that came *after* would be the Late Middle Ages.

Ania a medikal a panangagas wenno pamay-an ti saan a nadakamat ti paset kas us-usaren dagiti doktor ken siruhano bayat ti Imperio ti Roma?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangagas iti post-traumatic stress disorder babaen ti nadumaduma a sedatives**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *physical* medical procedures.** It details surgeries (amputations, blood vessel tying), pain management *during* procedures (morphine, scopolamine), and dealing with physical ailments like gangrene.
* **Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a *psychological* condition.** While the Romans used sedatives, the passage doesn't mention any systematic attempt to address the psychological trauma of war or injuries – only to manage pain.  The concept of PTSD as we understand it today wasn't developed at that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangusar kadagiti extract ti bukel ti herbane para iti scopolamine** - The passage *specifically* states they used scopolamine from henbane.
* **C: Pananglapped iti panagayus ti dara babaen kadagiti pangipit ti urat** - The passage explicitly mentions using ligatures (tying blood vessels) to control bleeding.
* **D: Panangaramid kadagiti pannakaputed ti bagi para kadagiti pasiente a gangrene** - The passage mentions amputation to prevent gangrene, which would involve cutting *through* the flesh.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The passage mentions Emperor Augustus starting salaries for doctors and forming the first Roman Medical Corps for treating soldiers. It also details surgical practices and the use of sedatives.
* **It *doesn't* state:** The passage does **not** mention the construction of dedicated, established hospitals during the Roman Empire. While medical treatment was provided (especially to soldiers), it wasn't within formalized hospital structures as we understand them today.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ti pannakabukel ti Medical Corps** - The passage explicitly states Augustus formed the first Roman Medical Corps.
* **B: Ti agresibo a pagalagadan ti militar ti Imperio** - The passage starts by stating the militaristic nature of the Roman Empire helped advance medical practice, specifically for treating war wounds.
* **D: Ti panangabang ti Emperador kadagiti doktor** - The passage mentions Augustus starting salaries for doctors.



"
Ania ti pagdependian ti abilidad a makakita?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti organ a pangrikna ti sistema**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""TI panagkita, wenno ti pannakabalin a makakita ket **nakadepende iti organ a pangrikna ti sistema bisual wenno dagiti mata**."" (Sight, or the ability to see, **depends on the sensory organ of the visual system or the eyes**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti kasapulan ti maysa nga organismo** - While an organism's needs *influence* the complexity of its vision, the ability to see itself is fundamentally dependent on the sensory organ.
*   **C: Maysa a sensibilidad iti sumagmamano a wave-length** - Sensitivity to wavelengths is a *characteristic* of how eyes work, but not the fundamental dependency.
*   **D: Agsasabali a digri ti katadem** -  Different degrees of acuity are also a *characteristic* but not the core dependency.



"
Ania ti agpannuray ti panagduduma ti istruktura ti mata iti nagbaetan dagiti organismo?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti kasapulan ti organismo** (The needs of the organism).

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Adu ti agduduma a pannakaaramid dagiti mata, **nakadepende ti kinakomplikadona iti kasapulan ti organismo**."" (Many different functions of the eyes, **the complexity of which depends on the needs of the organism**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sensibilidad ti wavelength** (Wavelength sensitivity) - While the passage mentions wavelength sensitivity as *a result* of differences, it's not the *reason* for the differences in eye structure.
*   **C: Lebel ti kinasiglat** (Level of agility) - This isn't discussed in the passage.
*   **D: Ti kinarikut ti organismo** (The complexity of the organism) - While related, the passage specifically points to the *needs* driving the complexity of the eye, not just general organism complexity.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ti guru ket pundamental nga aspeto ti amin a relihion idiay India ngem ti Sikhismo innalana ti kinapateg a mangporma iti tengnga ti pammati ti Sikh."" (The guru is a fundamental aspect of all religions in India, but Sikhism elevated its importance to form the center of Sikh faith.) This means the importance of the guru *distinguishes* Sikhism, rather than being a commonality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti Sikhismo ket resulta ti sektariano a panagsisina iti uneg ti tradision dagiti Hindu.** - The passage directly states this is how Sikhism *originated*.
*   **C: Siamna a guru ti simmaruno kalpasan ti nangipasdek iti relihion, ni Guru Nanak.** - The passage confirms this fact.
*   **D: Ti sumagmamano a tradision ti Sikhismo ket nairamut iti Hinduismo.** - The passage specifically says Sikhs acknowledge their roots in Hinduism and its customs.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maibilang a kangrunaan nga aspeto ti sistema ti pammati dagiti Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Ti konsepto ti guru**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ti guru ket pundamental nga aspeto ti amin a relihion idiay India ngem ti Sikhismo innalana ti kinapateg a mangporma iti tengnga ti pammati ti Sikh."" (The guru is a fundamental aspect of all religions in India, but Sikhism elevated its importance to form the center of Sikh faith.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti tradision dagiti Hindu:** While the text mentions Sikhism arose from within Hinduism and acknowledges its roots in Hindu customs, it doesn't say these traditions are *central* to their belief system.  They see it as a distinct religion.
* **C: Ti panagkedked a mangbigbig iti dadduma a relihion dagiti Indian:** The text doesn't support the idea that Sikhism focuses on criticizing other Indian religions.
* **D: Panagsao iti pagsasao a Punjabi:**  While ""Gurmat"" is defined as a Punjabi term, the language itself isn't the core of their belief system, but rather the name for their path.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a marigatan nga ipamaysa dagiti ubbing nga addaan iti Sakit iti Panagkurang iti Atension?","The correct answer is **A: Trabaho idiay eskuela**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti ubbing nga adda ADD na ket marigatan nga agpokus kadagiti banbanag a kas iti **trabaho idiay eskuela**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagay-ayam kadagiti ay-ayam:** The passage says they *can* focus on things like playing games.
* **C: Panagbuya kadagiti cartoon:** The passage says they *can* focus on things like watching cartoons.
* **D: Dagiti banag a magustuanda nga aramiden:**  The passage implies they can focus on things they *enjoy*, which is the opposite of difficulty.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...addaanda kadagiti napeggad a galgalad, makiramramanda kadagiti panagaapa, ken karitenda ti autoridad” tapno maparegtada ti utekda, ta saan a maparegta dagiti utekda babaen iti normal a panglakagan.""  This directly explains that engaging in risky behaviors is a way for children with ADD to stimulate their brains because their brains don't regulate themselves through normal means.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tapno maksayan ti hyperactivity** - While hyperactivity *is* a symptom of ADD, the text doesn't say the risky behaviors are to *relieve* it.
*   **B: Tapno matulonganda a makikonektar kadagiti kapatadanda** - The text doesn't mention anything about connecting with siblings.
*   **C: Tapno makagun-odda iti atension manipud kadagiti nagannakda** - While attention-seeking *can* be a behavior associated with ADD, the text specifically links the risky behaviors to brain regulation, not just getting attention.



"
"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti saan a pagarigan ti andamio?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a bassit a coach ti liga (A little league coach)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines scaffolding as *support* given to learners when tackling new tasks. It explicitly mentions examples like a teacher and the help features within software (like a paperclip in Microsoft Office). 

Let's look at the options:

* **A: Maysa a tutorial iti rugi ti ay-ayam iti kompiuter (A computer startup tutorial)** - This *is* a form of support for a new task - a good example of scaffolding.
* **B: Maysa a SAT tutor (An SAT tutor)** -  A tutor provides direct support and guidance – a clear example of scaffolding.
* **C: Maysa nga independiente a programa ti panagadal (An independent study program)** - While helpful, an independent program doesn't *provide* support *during* the learning process; it's something you do on your own.  It's more of a result of scaffolding than scaffolding itself.
* **D: Maysa a bassit a coach ti liga (A little league coach)** - A little league coach focuses on developing skills *over time* through practice and general encouragement. While helpful, it doesn't provide the *immediate, temporary support* for a *specific new challenge* that defines scaffolding as described in the text.

The key is that scaffolding is temporary support *while learning something new*.  A little league coach builds skills in the long run, but isn't necessarily providing support for a *specific new task* the way a tutorial or tutor would.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti konsepto ti andamio?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabalin nga adda dagiti birtual nga andamio**.

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly states* that scaffolding can be virtual (""Dagiti Virtual Scaffold ket naipauneg iti software...""). This makes option A a description *of* scaffolding, not something it is *not*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions of scaffolding, according to the text:

*   **B: Ad-adda a tulong daytoy ngem maysa a wagas ti panagadal** - The text states scaffolding is ""saan a wagas ti panagadal no diketdi maysa a tulong.""
*   **C: Pagaammo met daytoy kas nakabasar iti proyekto a pannakasursuro** - The first sentence of the passage connects scaffolding to project-based learning.
*   **D: Mausar dagiti andamio a mangitukon iti suporta iti rugi ti padas ti panagsursuro** - This aligns with the definition of scaffolding as providing support for new experiences.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a langa ti MySpace ti mabalin a makagunggona kadagiti estudiante a marigatan nga agbasa?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a direksion ti web**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Mabalinmo a sukatan tapno nalaka a basaen wenno adda ti ad-adu wenno basbassit a kulay no kayatmo.""  This refers to the ability to customize the page for easier readability, and the text directly links this to the benefit of ""maysa a direksion ti web"" being easy to remember and type for students who struggle with typing or spelling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panangibagay (Customization)** - While customization *allows* for easier reading, it's the *way* it's achieved (through a simple web address) that's the key benefit for struggling students.
*   **B: Dagiti blog (Blogs)** - Blogs are just one feature of MySpace, and the text doesn't highlight them as being helpful for students with reading difficulties.
*   **D: 54 milion a profile (54 million profiles)** - The number of profiles is just a statistic about the site's popularity and doesn't directly address reading accessibility.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a paset ti sungbat ni Khrushchev kadagiti riribuk dagiti trabahador?","The correct answer is **C: Paaduen ti kaltas iti sahod**.

Here's why:

The passage states the workers protested *against* low wages (""kaltas iti sahod""). Khrushchev's response included economic concessions (""dawat a pang-ekonomia""), but it doesn't say he *increased* wages. In fact, the original protest was *because* of low wages.  The other options are all explicitly mentioned as part of his response:

* **A: Mangdutok iti baro a primero ministro** - The passage says he ""immanamong iti pannakaisaad ti nalatak a tao a ni Wladyslaw Gomulka kas baro a primero ministro.""
* **B: Usaren dagiti tangke a pakigubat tapno maisubli ti urnos** - The passage states ""nangibaon ni Krushchev kadagiti tangke a pakigubat tapno mapasubli ti talna.""
* **D: Bigbigen ti sumagmamano a kalikaguman ti ekonomia** - The passage says he ""pinatganna met dagiti dawat a pang-ekonomia.""



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakaigapuan ti riribuk idiay Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Pannakaidutok ni Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev *responded* to the protests by installing Gomulka as prime minister. This means Gomulka's appointment was a *result* of the unrest, not a *cause* of it.

The passage explicitly states the unrest was triggered by:

*   **A: Komunismo** (the protests became against Communism)
*   **B: Kaawan ti makan** (lack of food)
*   **C: Kaltas iti sahod** (low wages)



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nangapektar iti relasion ti USSR ken USA?","The correct answer is **B: Opinion maipapan iti Germany**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that disagreements in **systems, processes, and culture** led to conflict between the USSR and USA after WWII. It also mentions Germany being a former adversary that contributed to the alliance between the USSR and USA, but *doesn't* say their opinions *about* Germany caused tension *between* them after the war.  The tension came from their differing ideologies and ways of doing things.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Dagiti pinagdumaanda iti kultura** - The passage directly states cultural differences contributed to the conflict.
*   **C: Dagiti agduduma a proseso** -  The passage mentions disagreements in ""processes.""
*   **D: Dagiti panagsusupiat maipapan kadagiti sistema** - The passage explicitly states disagreements in ""systems"" were a cause of the conflict.

Here's why:

* **P** clearly states the nervous system *maintains* blood flow and ensures it *doesn't stop*.  Slowing down blood flow is the opposite of what the passage describes.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Panagpabannayat ti pannagna ti dara (Increasing blood flow):** While not directly stated, maintaining blood flow implies the system can adjust it, potentially increasing it when needed.
* **C: Panagtalinaed ti homeostasis (Maintaining homeostasis):**  The passage describes a vital function of the nervous system – keeping the body functioning – which *is* homeostasis.
* **D: Panangliklik kadagiti mabalin a pangta ti bagi (Protecting the body from potential harm):**  Keeping the body ""alert"" to potential dangers is a direct consequence of the rapid nerve impulse transmission described.



"
Ania ti masarakan idiay Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti Dakkel a Piramid**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ti Giza Plateau...addaan iti sumagmamano a piramide (a ti naindaklan a piramide ti kadakkelan), sumagmamano a babassit a tantanem, sumagmamano a temtemplo, ken ti naindaklan nga Sphinx."" While tantanem and temtemplo are *also* there, the passage highlights the Great Pyramid as a key feature of the Giza Plateau.  It doesn't say all seven wonders are there (C), and it doesn't just mention tantanem (A) or temtemplo (B) in isolation.



"
Ania ti panggep ti Dakkel a Piramid?,"The correct answer is **B: Tapno mapadayawan ti maysa a Faraon**.

The passage specifically states: ""Iti dakkel a piramida ket naaramid tapno mapadayawan ni Parao Khufu..."" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the pyramid *is* one of the seven wonders, that's a result of its construction, not its *purpose*.
* **C:** Being a landmark is a consequence, not the initial reason for building it.
* **D:** The passage mentions the ""Valley of the Dead"" and tombs, but the pyramid itself was for honoring the Pharaoh, not simply burying people.



"
Asinno ti makagapu iti pannakaammotayo iti nangpuor a nangdadael iti templo?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Idi agangay, insurat ti Griego a historiador a ni Strabo dayta a nagan kas pagaammotayo itan."" (In the end, the Greek historian Strabo wrote that name so we know it today.)

This directly indicates that Strabo is the reason we know the name of the person who burned the temple.  The Ephesians *tried* to erase his name, Alejandro offered to rebuild (but didn't), and Artemis is a goddess - she wouldn't know who burned her temple!"
Ania ti umiso a keddeng maipapan iti pannakaaramid manen ti templo ni Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Naaramid manen dayta kalpasan ti panagturay ni Alejandro a Dakkel**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Idi kuan, kalpasan a matay ni Alejandro a Dakkel, naaramid manen ti templo idi 323 BCE."" This directly supports the idea that the rebuilding occurred *after* Alexander the Great's reign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti pannakaaramid manen ket binayadan ni Alejandro a Dakkel** - The passage says he *offered* to pay, but it wasn't accepted.
* **C: Nabilin ni Herostratus a mangsakup kadagiti gastos iti pannakaaramid manen** - Herostratus destroyed the temple, he didn't pay for its rebuilding.
* **D: Naaramid manen dayta idi 320 BCE** - The passage specifically states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano ti kaunaan a mabalin a nagna ti maysa a sebbangan iti dua a saka?","The correct answer is **A: Pito milion a tawen ti napalabas**.

The text states: ""uray no ti Sahelanthropus ket mabalin a nagna iti dua a sakana iti kas kasapa a pito a milion a tawen ti napalabas."" (even if Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dua milion a tawen ti napalabas:** This refers to *Homo Erectus*, not the earliest possible bipedalism.
*   **C: 3.9 milion a tawen ti napalabas:** This is a timeframe for *Australopithecus*, which is later than the potential earliest bipedalism.
*   **D: 4.2 milion a tawen ti napalabas:** This is also a timeframe for *Australopithecus*, still later than the potential earliest bipedalism.



"
Ania kadagitoy a sebbangan ti regular a magmagna iti dua a saka?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti tao ket nangrugi a nagnagna a nakatakder dua a milion a tawenen ti napalaban ti panagurar ti Homo Erectus (kayatna sawen nakatakder a tao)."" This directly states *Homo Erectus* were the first to regularly walk upright on two legs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sahelanthropus:** The passage says *Sahelanthropus* *may* have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago, but it doesn't state they *regularly* did.
* **C: Dagiti bipedal nga espesialisasion:** This is too general. The passage is about specific species.
* **D: Australopithecus:** The passage states *Australopithecus* did *not* regularly walk upright like humans, but evidence suggests some *ability* to do so.  They weren't the first to *regularly* walk upright.



"
Ania ti padpadasen nga aramiden ti armada ti Germany bayat ti WWII?,"The correct answer is **A: Pananglapped kadagiti tagilako nga aggapu idiay Britania**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ti German ga navy, nga agus-usar laeng ti bangka nga U, ket padpadasenna a pasardengen daytoy a trapiko."" This directly translates to ""the German navy, using only U-boats, attempted to intercept this traffic.""  ""Traffic"" refers to the American ships carrying men and materials *to* Britain, meaning the German navy was trying to sink the ships *from* Britain (or heading towards Britain).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says the German navy was *intercepting* traffic to Britain, not attacking Britain directly for receiving goods and people.
* **C:** The passage states the *Americans* were traveling across the Atlantic with materials, not the Germans.
* **D:** The German navy was intercepting ships heading *to* Britain, not attacking America.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, asinno ti kaaduan ti balligi iti gubat ti naval bayat ti Kampanya iti Amianan nga Atlantika?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti Briton ken Dagiti Amerikano**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Americans were working to transport men and materials *to help* Britain. It also says the German navy (U-boats) were *attempting to stop* this traffic. This clearly indicates the British and Americans were working together and were the primary actors trying to *succeed* in the campaign, and therefore were the ones ""winning"" the naval battle (even though it was a constant struggle).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti German** - The passage states they were *attempting to hinder* the Allies, not win the overall naval battle.
*   **C: Dagiti German ken Dagiti Briton** - While both were involved, the passage focuses on the British and Americans working *together* against the German efforts.
*   **D: Dagiti Briton** - The Americans played a crucial role in transporting supplies, making it a joint effort.



"
Ania ti awan idi impatungpal dagiti Assyrian ti panagusar iti cavalry?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti silla** (Saddles).

The passage explicitly states: ""Saan pay idi a naimbento ti pagtugawan iti likud ti kabalio..."" which translates to ""Saddles were not yet invented..."" This means the Assyrian cavalry did not use saddles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pana a krus (Crossbows):** The passage doesn't mention anything about crossbows.
* **C: Dagiti karuahe (Chariots):** The passage actually *mentions* chariots being used and becoming less effective, meaning they *did* use them.
* **D: Kabal (Horses):**  The passage is *about* the use of horses in cavalry! They clearly used horses.



"
Kasano a malabanan dagiti gubat nga agus-usar iti calvary?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakasakay iti kabalio** (Riding horses).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""dagiti Asiriano ti damo a nangiyussuat iti panagsakay iti kabalio bayat ti pannakigubat."" (The Assyrians were the first to extensively use horse riding in warfare.) and ""Ti cavalry ket dagiti mannakigubat a nakakabalio a makilaban."" (Cavalry are warriors who fight on horseback.)
* The question asks how battles were fought *using* cavalry.  The defining characteristic of cavalry is fighting *on* horses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti saka** (On foot) -  This is the *opposite* of how cavalry fights.
* **B: Awan ti kabal** (Without horses) - Cavalry *requires* horses!
* **D: Iti basbassit a suldado** (With few soldiers) - The number of soldiers isn't specifically related to *how* cavalry fights.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti saanmo a pakasarakan iti gagangay nga umili ti Babilonia?","The correct answer is **D: Panangiyeg kadagiti isakripisioda iti akin-uneg a santuario.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""dagiti laeng padi ti makaserrek [iti akin-uneg a santuario]"" (only priests can enter the inner sanctuary).  This means regular citizens *could not* offer sacrifices in the inner sanctuary.
* **Options A, B, and C** all describe activities that happened in the *outer* areas of the temple, accessible to the people.

Therefore, offering sacrifices in the inner sanctuary is the one thing the passage indicates a regular citizen of Babylonia would *not* be able to do.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti espesipiko a nairanta para kadagiti papadi?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti akin-uneg a santuario** (The inner sanctuaries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dagiti laeng padi ti makaserrek"" (only the priests could enter) into the inner sanctuary. This clearly defines a specific privilege *for* the priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti piesta (The festivals)** - The passage says priests *conduct* ceremonies *during* festivals, but doesn't state festivals are specifically *for* them.
*   **C: Dagiti seremonia (The ceremonies)** - Like festivals, priests perform ceremonies, but it's not exclusive to them.
*   **D: Dagiti ziggurat (The ziggurats)** -  Ziggurats are part of the temple complex, but the passage doesn't say priests have special access or responsibility regarding them specifically.



"
Kaano a nakagun-od ti kinalatak ni Ari a Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalpasan ti pannakatakaw ti tanemna** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The passage explicitly states: ""nagbalin isuna a nalatak gapu iti pannakadiskobre iti tanemna idi 1922"" (he became famous because of the discovery of his tomb in 1922).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bayat ti panagturayna** (During his reign) - The passage states he wasn't considered important *during* his time.
*   **C: Kalpasan ti pannakatakuat ti tanemna** (After the looting of his tomb) - The passage states his tomb was remarkably well-preserved, not looted.
*   **D: Kalpasan a nadakamat kadagiti kadaanan a listaan ti ari** (After being recorded in ancient lists of kings) - The passage states he *wasn't* recorded in ancient lists.



"
Ania ti namagbalin ken Ari a Tutankhamun a nalatak nga ari ti Ehipto?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti pannakatakuat iti di nariribuk a tanemna** (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""nagbalin isuna a nalatak gapu iti pannakadiskobre iti tanemna idi 1922"" (he became famous because of the discovery of his tomb in 1922). It also highlights the incredibly well-preserved state of the tomb and its contents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti kasasaadna kadagiti kadaanan a listaan ti ari** (His presence in ancient lists of kings) - The passage actually says he *wasn't* included in ancient lists of kings.
* **C: Ti pannakatakaw ti rinibu nga artifact manipud iti tanemna** (The theft of thousands of artifacts from his tomb) - The passage mentions artifacts were *found* in his tomb, not stolen.
* **D: Ti kaipapananna bayat dagiti kadaanan a panawen ti Ehipto** (His importance during ancient Egyptian times) - The passage states he wasn't considered important during his own time.



"
Ania ti saan a kabaelan nga aramiden ti Griego a mannaniw a ni Homer?,"The correct answer is **A: Makadenggeg (To hear)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Homer is a ""legendario a bulsek a mannaniw"" - a legendary blind poet.  ""Bulsek"" means blind. Therefore, he couldn't hear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Makakita (To see)** - The text explicitly states he was blind, so he couldn't see. However, the question asks what he *couldn't* do, and being blind is his defining characteristic as presented in the text.
* **C: Makapagna (To write)** - As a poet, he would have needed to dictate his works, but the text doesn't say he couldn't create the stories.
* **D: Makasarita (To speak)** - As a poet and storyteller, he would definitely have been able to speak.



"
Ania a nalatak a Griego ti pagaammo gapu iti sabali malaksid iti literatura?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maysa pay a mapadpadayawan nga Griego a matematiko ni Pythagoras, mabigbigbig para iti sikat a theorem a panggep ti relasion dagiti igid ti trianggulo."" (There is also a celebrated Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, famous for the popular theorem about the relationship of the sides of a triangle.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sophocles** - The passage identifies him as a playwright (literature).
* **B: Homer** - The passage identifies him as a poet (literature).
* **D: Aristophanes** - The passage identifies him as a playwright (literature).

The question specifically asks for someone famous *besides* literature, and Pythagoras is presented as a mathematician.



"
Sadinno ti nangbusbosan ti Hebreo a pamilia iti kaaduan a tiempoda?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti awanan linong**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kaaduan iti panagbiag dagiti Hebreo a pamilia ket napasamak ti awanan linong"" (Most of the lives of Hebrew families happened without roofs/outdoors). This means they spent most of their time outdoors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iti kalsada** - While they used simple tables on the streets, the passage doesn't say they *lived* there.
* **C: Iti paraangan** - The passage mentions trees being sparse, not gardens.
* **D: Iti balay** - The passage states they didn't spend *most* of their time in their homes.



"
Ania ti saan unay a napateg iti pamilia Hebreo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti klimada (The climate)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ti nabara a klima iti Tengnga a Daya, ti balay ket saan unay a nasisita."" This directly translates to ""The hot climate of the Middle East, the house is not very important.""  This implies that the climate was a significant factor in how they lived, and houses weren't prioritized because of it.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti istoriada (Stories):** The passage doesn't mention stories.
* **C: Ti pagtaenganda (Their dwellings):** The passage *describes* their dwellings, but says they weren't highly valued *because* of the climate.
* **D: Ti panaglutoda (Their cooking):** While cooking is mentioned, it isn't presented as something unimportant.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nailadawan a nagdumaan dagiti pagilian ti Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti daga**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while ""Scandinavian"" is used as a general term, there are *many differences* in history, people, and customs between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. It *doesn't* mention any differences in the land (daga) itself. 

Therefore, the passage doesn't describe the land as a differing factor between the Scandinavian countries.



"
Asinno ti immuna a nagnaed idiay Greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti tribo ti Eskimo**.

The passage states: ""Uray awan ti pannakadiskubrena, dagiti tribo ti Eskimo ket agtaltalinaed idiayen idiay a kanito."" which translates to ""Even before its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there."" 

While Erik the Red later explored and named Greenland, the Eskimo tribes were there *first*.
"
Ania a grupo ti kaykayat a mangan nga awan ti tugaw?,"The correct answer is **C: Nabaknang a lallaki a Romano** (Wealthy Roman men).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti makmakan ti kadaanan a Roma ket mabalin a saan a pakairamanan dagiti makan a napan iti Europa a naggapu iti Amerika wenno naggapu iti Asia idi naud-udi a siglo... dagiti baknang a lallaki ket kayat da nga adda bangketeda a mabalin a sala a pagurayan idiay igid bayat a mangmanganda.""  This translates to ""The diet of ancient Rome may not have included foods introduced from Europe after the Americas or Asia in recent centuries... wealthy men wanted to have couches where they could recline while eating.""

This directly states that wealthy men desired couches (bangket) for reclining *while eating*, implying they didn't have a standard seat/table arrangement. The text doesn't mention anything about other groups wanting or needing this.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a paset ti maysa a piesta dagiti nagkakauna a Romano?,"The correct answer is **D: Maysa a plato ti naituno a pabo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""saan a pulos nakaramraman iti pabo dagiti nagkakauna a Romano."" (Turkeys were not included in the meals of the early Romans).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakurapay a sangaili a mangmangan kadagiti tugaw** - The passage mentions ""dagitoy pobre a tattao ken dayta babae ken kinnanna daydiay makanda agdama a nakatugaw iti tugawan,"" (these poor people and that woman and they ate what they had while seated) indicating this was part of the feast.
*   **B: Maysa a pangpangan ti birurukong** - The passage mentions ""birruruko"" as being part of the feast.
*   **C: Nabaknang a lallaki a nakaidda bayat ti pangrabii** - The passage describes ""dagiti baknang a lallaki ket kayat da nga adda bangketeda a mabalin a sala a pagurayan idiay igid bayat a mangmanganda."" (wealthy men wanted to have couches to recline on while eating).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nalabit nga addaan iti mataginayon nga epekto?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a minoria a kultura**.

Here's why:

The passage states that minority cultures ""masansan a mapukaw... saan ida a mabigbig a kas naan-anay a sibilisasion"" (are often lost... and are not considered as typical civilizations). This implies they *lack* a lasting impact compared to the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa a kagimongan (A society)** - The passage defines civilization *as* a society, implying it has a lasting effect.
*   **C: Maysa a siudad-estado (A city-state)** - The passage states city-states were the first to evolve into countries, demonstrating their historical significance and lasting impact.
*   **D: Maysa a kultura ti sibilisasion (A civilization's culture)** - The passage specifically highlights that civilization's culture is about the transmission of knowledge across generations, which *is* a lasting effect.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti umun-una ngem ti maysa a nasion?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a siudad-estado**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti siudad-estado dagiti immuna a nabangon a nagbalin a pagpagilian."" (City-states were the first to arise and become countries.) 

This directly answers the question of what came before a nation. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Maysa a kultura ti sibilisasion** - While civilization is important, the text says city-states came *before* nations.
*   **B: Maysa a singular a kultura** - The text doesn't emphasize a single culture, but rather how civilizations preserve and pass on culture.
*   **D: Maysa a minoria a kukultura** - The text states minority cultures are often overlooked and not considered ""full-fledged"" civilizations.



"
Ania a keddeng maipapan iti Drukgyal Dzong ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **A: Naaramid dayta tapno maramrambakan ti balligi dagiti puersa ti Tibet-Mongol.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kunada nga idi 1649, ni Zhabdrung Ngawag Namgyel ket nangaramid ti baluarte tapno **malagip ti pannakaparmek ti puersa ti Tibetan-Mongol**."" (It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress **to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces**.)  This means it was built to *remember* the victory, not to *launch attacks* against them.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Masarakan dayta idiay Bhutan** - The passage states it's in the Paro District *of Bhutan*.
* **C: Dinadael ti uram ti adu kadagiti relikya ti sarikedked** - The passage states ""...maysa nga uram ti nangigapu a dadduma laeng kadagiti reliko iti Drukgyal Dzong ti naibati..."" (a fire caused some of the relics in Drukgyal Dzong to be lost.)
* **D: Daytoy ket inaramid ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The passage explicitly states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it.



"
Ania a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan iti nagbanagan ti uram idiay Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti laeng nabati a relikya ket ti ladawan ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Idi 1951, maysa nga uram ti nangigapu a dadduma laeng kadagiti reliko iti Drukgyal Dzong ti naibati, kas ti imahe ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" This directly answers the question of what *wasn't* saved from the fire - everything except the image.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nagballigi dagiti puersa ti Tibet-Mongol:** The passage mentions the dzong was *built* to commemorate a victory *over* Tibetan-Mongol forces, not that they started a fire.
* **C: Saan a naapektaran ti kinalatak ti atraksion:** The passage states the dzong *remained* a major attraction *after* the fire, but this isn't what the fire *destroyed* or what wasn’t saved.
* **D: Daytoy ket napreserba babaen ken ni Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the dzong initially, but the passage doesn't say he preserved it *after* the fire.  It states the fortress itself was preserved.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan iti Cambodia ti pudno?,"The correct answer is **D: Dinadael dagiti Thai ti Phnom Penh**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Niraut dagiti Thai ti Cambodia iti mano nga ulit idi ika-18 a siglo ken idi 1722 dinadaelda ti Phnom Phen."" (The Thai raided Cambodia many times in the 18th century and in 1722 they sacked Phnom Penh).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dinadael dagiti Vietnamese ti Phnom Penh:** The passage states the Vietnamese raided Cambodia *later* in the 18th century, but doesn't mention them sacking Phnom Penh.
*   **B: Rinaut ti Cambodia ti Thailand idi 1772:** The passage only mentions a raid/sacking in 1722.
*   **C: Ti Cambodia ket rinaut da dagiti Vietnamese idi rugi ti maika-18 a siglo:** The passage states the Vietnamese raids happened towards the *end* of the 18th century, not the beginning.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti panagraut ti Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Namin-adu a rinaut dagiti Thai ti Cambodia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Niraut dagiti Thai ti Cambodia iti mano nga ulit idi ika-18 a siglo..."" (The Thai raided Cambodia many times in the 18th century...). This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Namin-adu a rinaut dagiti Vietnamese ti Cambodia:** While the passage mentions Vietnamese raids, it doesn't state they raided *more* than the Thai.
* **B: Dagiti Thai ken Vietnamese rinautda ti Cambodia idi 1772:** The passage mentions raids throughout the 18th century and specifically states the Thai sacked Phnom Penh in 1722, not 1772.
* **C: Dinadael dagiti Vietnamese ti Phnom Penh:** The passage states the *Thai* sacked Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga inaramid ti Dutch East India Company bayat ti kaaddada idiay Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **D: Situtulok nga ited ti panangtengngel ti Taiwan iti dinastia ti Qing**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Dutch East India Company *established* a base in southwestern Taiwan (A).**
* **The passage specifically mentions they *altered* the livelihood of the indigenous people (B) and *employed* Chinese workers (C).**
* **The passage does *not* say the Dutch willingly gave control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty *conquered* the western and northern coasts from the Dutch in 1683.**

Therefore, option D is the only action the Dutch East India Company did *not* do, according to the provided text."
Ania ti impasdek ti Katulagan ti Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti autoridad ti Japan iti Taiwan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kalpasan ti pannakaabak iti Umuna a Gubat a Sino-Japanese (1894-1895), pinirmaan ti gobierno ti Qing ti Katulagan ti Shimonoseki, a **nangisuko iti soberania ti Taiwan iti Japan**, a nangituray iti isla agingga iti 1945.""

This directly means the treaty ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, giving Japan authority over the island.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the treaty *resulted* from Japan's victory, the treaty itself didn't *equal* the victory. It was the consequence of it.
*   **B:** The treaty *changed* Taiwan's status, taking it *away* from the Qing dynasty, it didn't confirm its status *as* a Qing province.
*   **C:** The treaty didn’t give Taiwan any ability to regain coastal areas. It lost sovereignty.



"
Kasano a maammuan ti lebel ti pH iti kemikal?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti dagup dagiti ion ti Hydrogen iti kemikal**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Maammuan ti nibel ti pH babaen kaadu ti bilang dagiti ion ti Hydrogen (ti H iti pH) iti naamiris a kemikal.""  This directly translates to ""The pH level is known by the number of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kasano kabasiko wenno kaasido iti kemikal** - While pH *indicates* acidity or basicity, it doesn't *define* how pH is measured.
*   **B: Kasano kaadu dagiti proton iti kemikal** - The passage states ions of Hydrogen *are* protons, but pH is measured by the *number* of these ions, not just knowing they exist.
*   **D: Kasano kaadu dagiti elektron iti kemikal** - The passage mentions electrons in relation to how ions are formed, but pH is not directly measured by counting electrons.



"
Ana iti inikkat gapu dagiti ion ti Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti elektron**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dagiti ion ti hydrogen ket dagiti proton a naawanan iti elektron..."" (Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron...). This directly answers the question of what is taken *from* hydrogen ions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti proton** - Ions of hydrogen *are* protons, but the question asks what is *removed* to *make* them ions.
*   **B: pH** - pH is a measure *of* hydrogen ions, not something taken from them.
*   **C: Alkalino** - Alkalino (basic) describes a type of chemical, not something removed from hydrogen ions.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti grupo iti leon?,"The correct answer is **C: Amin dagiti lallaki ken babbai ket asideg nga agkakabagian**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kaaduanna a dagiti babbai dagiti asideg nga agkakabagian, kas maysa a dakkel a pamilia dagiti agkakabsat a babbai ken annak a babbai."" This means *mostly* the females are closely related, not all lions (both male and female).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Mangtignayda nga umasping kadagiti aso** - The passage explicitly states this: ""Agtignay dagiti grupo ti leon a kas met laeng kadagiti grupo dagiti lobo wenno dagiti aso.""
* **B: Ti annugat ti lalaki ken babai ket saan a agpagisu** - The passage states there are 1-3 males and up to 30 females and cubs, implying a difference in number.
* **D: Pada a makapapatay ken nasayaat ti pannakikaduada** - The passage says they are ""aynayup a makapasiddaw a kapada dagiti leon"" and ""napeggad pay unay para kadagiti biktimada,"" meaning they are effective predators.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagtignay iti leon?,"The correct answer is **C: Agpada dagiti lallaki ken babbai ket makapapatay unay iti kanenda.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agtignay dagiti grupo ti leon a kas met laeng kadagiti grupo dagiti lobo wenno dagiti aso...ken napeggad pay unay para kadagiti biktimada."" This means they hunt *like* wolves or dogs, and are very effective predators.  It *doesn't* say both males and females are equally dangerous to their prey. It implies the group as a whole is dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Nasayaat ti pannakikaduada** – The passage explicitly states lions are successful hunters (""dagiti kasasayaatan ti pannakikaduana"").
* **B: Ti panagtignayda ket maipumadpad iti kadagiti lobo** – The passage directly compares their hunting style to that of wolves (""Agtignay dagiti grupo ti leon a kas met laeng kadagiti grupo dagiti lobo"").
* **D: Ti panagtignayda nga umasping kadagiti dadduma a dadakkel a pusa** – The passage mentions they hunt similarly to other big cats (""ay-ayup a makapasiddaw a kapada dagiti leon"").



"
Dagiti kuneho ket kadawyan a kanen ti ania a klase a manangraut?,"The correct answer is **A: Babbabassit a pusa**.

The passage states: ""...ngem kadakuada a mangmangan iti babbabassit a klase ti ayup a kas iti kuneho..."" (but they eat small animals like rabbits...). This directly links rabbits as prey for small cats.



"
Ti babbabassit a pusa ket aganup ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **A: Ut-utot**.

Here's why:

The passage states that small cats (agraman - likely meaning feral or wild cats) eat ""adayo ken ad-adu a babassit nga animal a kas insekto, utot, alutiit, ken billit"" (and many more small animals like insects, **ut-utot** - which translates to frogs - lizards, and snails).

The other options (kuneho, antelope, ugsa) are mentioned as prey for *larger* cats, not the small ones.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a paset ti pamay-an ti panaganup iti ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: Surutenda ti kanenda bayat iti rabii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Makakitada a nalaing iti kasipngetan gapu iti pannakakitada iti rabii, ken makapaggunayda a sililimed."" (They are good at seeing in the dark because they can see at night, and they hunt in the shadows). This means they *hunt* at night, not *search for* prey at night.  The passage focuses on their ability to *see* in the dark to aid hunting, not actively searching by sight.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **A: Ag-camouflageda iti aglawlawda** - ""Aganup dagiti ocelot iti taraonda babaen ti panagtagilingedda iti aglawlawda sadanto seppegen ti biktimada."" (Ocelots hunt by blending into the foliage to surprise their victims.) - This is a clear hunting tactic.
* **B: Surutenda ti angot ti kanenda** - ""Panunoten dagiti sientipiko a dagiti ocelot surutenda ken biruken dagiti animal a kanenda (prey) babaen ti angot, agsinglot iti no ayanna da iti daga."" (Scientists note that ocelots track and find the animals they eat (prey) by scent, sniffing to see if they are on the ground.) - This is directly stated.
* **D: Kanenda laeng ti ayup nga basbassit ti kadakkelna** - ""Dandani amin nga ay-ayup a tiltiliwen ti ocelot ket basbassit nga amang ngem iti daytoy."" (All the animals hunted by ocelots are smaller than them.) - This is a description of their prey.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ti riknada ti angot ket nakapsut** (Their sense of smell is weak).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Panunoten dagiti sientipiko a dagiti ocelot surutenda ken biruken dagiti animal a kanenda (prey) babaen ti angot..."" (Scientists note that ocelots track and find the animals they eat by scent...). This directly contradicts option C, indicating their sense of smell is *strong*, not weak.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Makaanupda a nalaing iti rabii** (They can hide well at night) - The passage says ""Makakitada a nalaing iti kasipngetan..."" (They are good at hiding in the darkness...)
* **B: Makagunayda a sililimed** (They can jump silently) - The passage states ""makapaggunayda a sililimed"" (they can jump silently).
* **D: Kaykayatda nga aganup iti babassit nga ayup** (They like to hunt small animals) - The passage starts with ""Magustuan dagiti ocelot ti mangan kadagiti babassit nga ayup"" (Ocelots like to eat small animals).



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a kadakkelan a pigsa iti tigre?,"The correct answer is **A: Panag-agdaranudor**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagitoy nga uppat a pusa laeng ti agdaranudor"" (Only these four cats roar). This means roaring *is* a characteristic of tigers, and therefore a type of strength/ability.
* **The passage also mentions:**
    * **Panaguli (Climbing):**  ""makakauli (ngem saan unay)"" - tigers can climb (but not very well).
    * **Panaglagto (Swimming):** ""makalangoy"" - tigers can swim.
    * **Panagguyod (Strength):** ""mangguyod ti maminlima a puersa ti napigsa a tao"" - tigers can drag five times the strength of a strong man.

Therefore, all options *except* panag-agdaranudor are explicitly mentioned as capabilities showcasing the tiger's strength.  While roaring can be impressive, the passage doesn't frame it as a *physical* strength in the same way as the others.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania iti subang a nagbaetan dagiti tigre ken leon?","The correct answer is **B: Ti uni ti daranudorda** (The ability to roar).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ti tigre ket mairaman iti pada a grupo (Genus Panthera) kas iti leon, leopard ken jaguar. Dagitoy nga uppat a pusa laeng ti agdaranudor."" (The tiger is included in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that roar.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti kabaelanda nga aglangoy** (Their ability to swim) - While the passage states tigers *can* swim, it doesn't mention if lions can or compare their swimming abilities.
* **C: Ti distansia ti panaglagtoda** (The distance they can jump) - The passage mentions tigers can jump far, but doesn't say anything about lions jumping.
* **D: Ti pigsa ti panagguyodda** (Their strength in dragging) - The passage states a tiger can drag five times the strength of a strong man, but doesn't compare this to a lion's strength.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti inaramid ni Robert Hooke sakbay ti dadduma a biologo?","The correct answer is **A: Nangpaliiw kadagiti natay a selula**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Isuna ti kaunaan a tao a nangpaliiw kadagiti natay a selula."" (He was the first person to observe dead cells.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nangusar ti mikroskopio tapno kitaen ti organismo** - While he *did* use a microscope, the passage focuses on *what he observed* (cells) rather than just the act of using the microscope. Many biologists use microscopes.
* **C: Nangpaliiw kadagiti babassit a kuadrado** - He observed ""babassit a kuadrado,"" but the important part is that he identified these as *cells* - the first observation of cells.
* **D: Nakadiskubre ti kababassitan nga adda usarna a yunit iti organismo** -  The passage says a cell *is* the smallest unit, but it doesn't say Hooke *discovered* that fact. It states the definition of a cell.



"
Ania ti kayatna a saoen ti naggapuan ti sarita a “selyula”?,"The correct answer is **B: Bassit a kuarto**.

The passage states: ""Iti selula ket naggapu iti sao Latin a *cella* a kayatna sawen **bassit a kuarto**."" (The cell comes from the Latin word *cella* which means **small room**.)



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaaduan ti ayup ti addan ti abilidad nga ania?","The correct answer is **B: Aggaraw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaaduan nga ayup ket **makagaraw**."" (Most animals can breathe.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agtayab (Fly):** While some animals fly, the passage doesn't say *most* animals can fly.
*   **C: Aglangoy (Swim):** The passage says animals swim in the sea, but not that *most* can.
*   **D: Agkali (Walk):**  The passage says animals walk on land, but not that *most* can.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti awan ti sumagmamano nga ayup?","The correct answer is **C: Ututek**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dagiti ayup laeng ti adda utekna (nupay saan nga amin nga ayup ketdi; kas pagarigan ti jellyfish, awan utekna).""  This directly translates to ""Animals are the only ones that have a brain (although not all animals do; for example, jellyfish do not have a brain).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Selselyula (Cells):** The text states animals *are made of* many cells.
* **B: Ti abilidad a mangrunaw ti makan (Ability to digest food):** The text states animals ""tunawenda iti unegda"" (digest inside them), meaning they *have* this ability.
* **D: Ti abilidad a mangan (Ability to eat):** The text implies this as part of digestion.



"
Ania ti mangtulong kadagiti mula ti proseso iti photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Init**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agpartuat dagiti mula iti taraonda manipud iti init babaen iti photosynthesis."" This translates to ""Plants produce their food from sunlight through photosynthesis."" 

Therefore, sunlight (init) is essential for the process of photosynthesis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Linong (Light)** - While light *is* involved, the passage specifically mentions *sunlight* as the source of energy for photosynthesis. Light is a general term.
*   **B: Ay-ayup (Animals)** - Animals benefit *from* plants, but don't help *with* photosynthesis.
*   **C: Makan (Food)** - Plants *produce* food through photosynthesis, they don't need food to perform it.



"
Ania ti iruar dagiti tao a lang-aben dagiti mula?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""agalada iti carbon dioxide nga iruar dagiti tao (dayta ket paruar a panangyanges)."" This translates to ""take in carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is exhalation)."" 

Therefore, plants take in the carbon dioxide *that people breathe out*.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagarigan ti mangabbeng ti proseso ti ebolusion?","The correct answer is **B: Ti paset ti maysa a populasion nga umakar ti baro nga aglawlaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that speciation (a key part of evolution) begins when a *small group* from a larger population becomes isolated in a new environment.** This isolation (moving to a new habitat) is the trigger for the changes that eventually lead to a new species.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti bassit a grupo ket saan a nakabiag a nasayaat iti baro a lokasion:** While a new location presents challenges, the passage doesn't say *failure* to thrive initiates evolution. It's the *difference* in the environment and the need to adapt that drives the process.
* **C: Ti populasion a mangmangibagay ti pakairuamanda iti baro nga aglawlaw:** Adaptation is a *result* of the process, not the initiating event. The passage describes the need to adapt *after* isolation.
* **D: Maysa a populasion a nangbukel iti dua:**  This is the *outcome* of speciation, not the beginning of the process. The passage explains how a single population *eventually* splits into two distinct ones.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti proseso iti panag-sebbangan? ,"The correct answer is **A: Isu ti mapasamak no ti baro a populasion ket saan a nakairuaman.**

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""kasapulan ti baro a populasion dagiti nadumaduma a galad wenno pannakairuam tapno agbalin a napigpigsa a makisalisal."" (the new population needs different genes or adaptations to become better at surviving).  If a new population *isn't* adapting, it won't diverge and speciate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isu ti napateg a aspeto ti proseso ti ebolusion:** The passage states, ""saan a maliklikan a resulta ti speciation ket maysa daytiy a napateg unay a paset ti ebolusion."" (speciation is an unavoidable result and a very important part of evolution).
* **C: Saoenna ti pannakabukel ti baro a sebbangan:** The passage defines speciation as ""ti pannakabukel ti baro nga species."" (the formation of a new species).
* **D: Ti pasamakna ket saan a maliklikan:** The passage states, ""saan a maliklikan a resulta ti speciation."" (speciation is an unavoidable result).



"
Ania a paset iti sistema ti panagbalikuskos ti mangiyeg ti dara papan ti puso?,"The correct answer is **D: Veins**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ti dara ket pumanaw aggapo iti puso idiay tubo a maawagan nga arteries ken **agsubli iti puso manipud iti tubo a maawagan a veins**."" (The blood goes from the heart through tubes called arteries and **returns to the heart from tubes called veins**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Arteries** - Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart.
*   **B: Capillaries** - Capillaries are the smallest tubes and are where exchange of materials happens, they don't directly return blood to the heart.
*   **C: Or-organo** - This translates to ""organ"" and is too general. While the heart is an organ, it's not the tube that carries blood *to* the heart.



"
Ania ti sangkabassitan a tubo ti sistema ti panagbalikuskos?,"The correct answer is **A: Capillaries**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti sangkabassitan a tubo ket maawagan a capillaries."" (The smallest tube is called capillaries.) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Arteries** - The passage says arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, not that they are the smallest tubes.
* **C: Veins** - The passage says veins carry blood *to* the heart, not that they are the smallest tubes.
* **D: Or-organo** - This doesn't relate to the question about tubes.



"
Ti abilidad ti insekto a mangkupin kadagiti payyakda a mangisubli a paurnos ket mangpaadu ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti espasio ti paglemmengan** (Sleeping spaces).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mangted daytoy kadakuada ti nalawlawa a lugar tapno makalemmengda kadagiti mabalin a mangan kadakuada."" This translates to ""This gives them a wider area to hide from potential predators.""  The ability to fold their wings provides *more space to hide* – essentially, more sleeping/hiding spaces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Suplay ti makan (Food supply):** While flying helps *find* food, the wing-folding itself doesn't increase the *amount* of food.
*   **C: Panagsapul ti kapareha (Finding a mate):**  The passage doesn't link wing-folding to mating.
*   **D: Kapartak ti tayab (Flight efficiency):** The passage states wing-folding helps with hiding, not necessarily with the *efficiency* of flight itself.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat ti paset kas a banag nga apektado iti abilidad ti insekto a tumayab?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangpaganak (Reproduction)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how flying ability aids insects in survival:** escaping predators (kalabanda), finding food (makan), and having a wider range to find mates (kapareha).
* **Panangpaganak (Reproduction)**, while important for insect survival, isn't *directly* addressed as being *affected* by the ability to fly. The passage mentions finding mates, which *facilitates* reproduction, but doesn't say flying *changes* the act of reproduction itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kabayag ti biag (Lifespan):**  Flying helps insects avoid predators, thus *affecting* how long they live.
* **C: Panagsapul ti makan (Finding food):** The passage explicitly states flying helps insects ""epektibo a makasapul ti makan"" (effectively find food).
* **D: Kabaelan (Ability):** This is too broad. The passage is *about* the ability to fly and how it impacts various aspects of an insect's life.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a kababalin ti saan a gagangay a nainaig kadagiti dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Akinlikud a magmagna** (Using two hind legs).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...addaan kadagiti billit a kapadpada dagiti dinosaur...magnada nga usarenda ti dua nga akinlikud a sakada a kas ti T-Rex."" This *describes* dinosaurs using two hind legs (like the T-Rex) as a characteristic *they* have, not something *unique* to them.  The passage implies other creatures also do this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dudutdot** (Warm-bloodedness) - The passage mentions people don't recognize dinosaurs ""because of their warm blood and feathers,"" linking this to dinosaurs.
* **C: Panagitlog** (Laying eggs) - The passage specifically states ""agitlogda"" (they lay eggs) as a dinosaur characteristic.
* **D: Nagkuko dagiti saka** (Having claws on their feet) - The passage states they have claws and talons, indicating claws on the feet.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a gagangay a maibilang a nabingbingay a kababalin dagiti billit ken dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti abilidad nga agtayab (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Adu kadagiti tattao a saanda panunoten a dinosaurda gapu ta adda iti dutdotda ken makatayabda."" (Many people don't realize they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.) This implies that *flying* is a characteristic that often hides the dinosaur connection from people.  It's the trait specifically mentioned as causing confusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagitlog dagiti itlog (Laying eggs):** The passage explicitly states dinosaurs lay eggs (""agitlogda"").
* **B: Usaren ti dua nga akinlikud a saka tapno magna (Using two hind legs to eat):** The passage mentions the T-Rex using its two hind legs to eat (""magnada nga usarenda ti dua nga akinlikud a sakada a kas ti T-Rex"").
* **D: Saka nga addaan kuko (Claws on feet):** The passage states they have claws (""siksik ken karamut"").



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a paset ti mula a cycad ti mabalin a kanen ti Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti natangken a bulong** (The tough leaves).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Mabalin nga inusar ti Triceratops ti napigsa a sippitna tapno ikkaten dagiti bulbulong sakbayna a kanen ti sanga."" (Triceratops might have used its strong beak to scrape the leaves before eating the branches.)

The other options are incorrect because the text doesn't mention the Triceratops eating the trunk (puon), roots (ramot), or fruit (bunga) of the cycad plant. It focuses on the leaves.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kaaduan a mabalin a kanen ti maysa a Triceratops? ","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a mula nga addaan kadagiti natangken a sanga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti ngipen ti triceratop ket mabalin a makabael a mangparpar saan laeng a bulong no di ket uray dagiti natangken a sanga ken ramot."" (The teeth of a Triceratops were able to tear not only leaves but also tough branches and twigs.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a sloth:** The passage *mentions* sloths as an example of an animal that eats tough leaves, but a Triceratops wouldn't eat a sloth.
* **C: Maysa a parrot:**  Parrots are mentioned as being related to dinosaurs and eating tough plant matter, but the passage doesn't say Triceratops ate *parrots*.
* **D: Maysa a mula nga addaan iti makasabidong a prutas:** The passage discusses the possibility that cycads (the plants Triceratops might have eaten) were poisonous and that modern animals that eat tough plants *also* eat things that aren't poisonous, but it doesn't say Triceratops ate fruit.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti nalabit a nasaknap a nalatak kadagiti makin-amianan unay a rehion ti Italia?","The correct answer is **C: Snowboarding**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kalalatakan dagiti isport a pang-winter kadagiti Umamianan a rehion..."" (Winter sports are popular in the northern regions...). While the text doesn't *specifically* mention snowboarding, it's a winter sport and therefore the most logical answer among the options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Football** - The text states football is popular *generally* in Italy, not specifically in the north.
*   **B: Volleyball** - Like football, volleyball is listed as a popular sport in Italy as a whole, not just the north.
*   **D: Karera ti motor ti F1 (Motor racing F1)** - This is listed as a generally popular sport, not one specific to northern Italy.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti nangabak iti kampeonato ti lubong para iti Italia?","The correct answer is **A: Football**.

The text specifically states: ""ti nailian a grupo ti football ti Italy... ket isuda dagiti kampeon iti FIFA World Cup idi 2006"" (the Italian national football team... and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006).  This means Italy won the world championship in football.

The text only *lists* other sports as popular in Italy, but doesn't mention Italy winning world championships in water-polo, basketball, or cycling."
Kalpasan ti ania a pasamak a nagbalin a Belgian ti dadduma a paset ti Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti Rebolusion ti Belgium**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti agdama a parte ti Belgium ket parte ti Luxembourg idi un-unana ngem nagbalin a parte ti Belgium kalpasan ti rebolusion idiay Belgium idi 1830."" 

This directly links the shift of those areas from Luxembourg to Belgium with the Belgian Revolution.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangapektar iti neutralidad ti Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti panangsakup dagiti German** (The occupation by the Germans).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kanayon a padpadasen ti Luxembourg nga agtalinaed a neutral a pagilian ngem naparmek isuna ti Germany iti agpada a Gubat Sangalubungan I ken Gubat Sangalubungan II."" This directly indicates that German occupation *affected* (and violated) Luxembourg's neutrality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pannakikadua iti European Union** (Joining the European Union) - This happened *after* the periods of neutrality were challenged, and actually signifies a shift *away* from strict neutrality.
* **C: Ti Rebolusion ti Belgium** (The Belgian Revolution) - While the revolution led to Luxembourg losing territory, it didn't directly impact Luxembourg's *neutrality* itself.
* **D: Agbalin nga agwaywayas a pagilian** (Becoming an independent country) - Independence in 1839 set the stage for neutrality, but didn't *affect* it - it was a prerequisite *for* attempting neutrality.



"
Mano a kilometro kuadrado ti dagup a kalawa ti Turkey idiay Europa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""23,764 kuadrado a kilometro (9,174 sq mi) ket adda idiay Europe."" (23,764 square kilometers are in Europe).



"
"Segun iti paset, agarup mano a milia ti kaatiddog ti Turkey?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Ti teritoryo ti Turkey ket nasurok a 1,600 kilometro (1,000 milya) kaatiddog..."" which translates to ""The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long...""
"
Para iti ania ti panagusar ti Latin a pagsasao iti Siudad ti Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti relihioso a seremonia**.

The passage states: ""Latin met ti masansan a mausar kadagiti relihioso a seremonia."" (Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.)



"
"Iti Siudad ti Vatican, ania iti saan a pagusaran ti Italian a pagsasao?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti relihioso a seremonia**.

Here's why:

The passage states that **Latin** is frequently used in religious ceremonies, not Italian.  The other options are all explicitly stated as uses of Italian within Vatican City.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangbenepiso gapu ti panaglalaok ti uni ti sopistikado a kompiuter?","The correct answer is **A: Musika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti musika ket masansan a mairekrekord babaen kadagiti narikot a kompiuter tapno iproseso ken paglaokenna dagiti uni."" (Music is often recorded by sophisticated computers to process and enhance sounds.)

This directly links sophisticated computers to the benefit of improving music/sounds.  The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not as things *benefitting* from the computer processing of sound.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, agarup amin a balbalay iti ania a lokasion ti addaan iti mai-flush a kasilias?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The text states: ""Addaan iti mai-flush a kasilias iti **agarup amin a balbalay kadagiti siudad ti Harappa ken Mohenjo-daro**..."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Persia:** The text mentions kasilyas *in* Persia, but not that *all* homes had them.
*   **C: Santorini:** The text says Santorini had drainage systems in *houses*, not necessarily flushing toilets in all houses.
*   **D: Tsina:** The text mentions kasilyas *in* Tsina, but not that *all* homes had them.



"
Ania iti sumaganad a lokasion ti panagsarakan ti naiyuna a sistema ti pagrugitan?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage states: ""Addaan iti mai-flush a kasilias iti agarup amin a balbalay kadagiti siudad ti Harappa ken Mohenjo-daro..."" which translates to ""There were flushing toilets in almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro..."" This indicates Harappa (and Mohenjo-daro) had early toilet systems.

While the passage mentions toilet systems in other locations (Santorini, Egypt, Persia, China, Rome), it specifically states Harappa *had* flushing toilets, implying it was one of the earliest, if not *the* earliest, to have such a system.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pakaigapuan ti panagturong ti skater?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti bassit a kurbada iti baba ti tadem ti skate** (The slight curve at the bottom of the skate blade).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gapu ta iti baba ti tadem ket apagapaman a nagkurba, agirig ti tadem iti maysa a bangir wenno iti sabali a bangir, agkurba met ti ikingna a maitama iti yelo. Isu ti gapuna daytoy nga agturong dagiti skater."" (Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, the blade leans to one side or the other, causing the edge to dig into the ice. That is why skaters turn.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti dua nga igid ti tadem ti skate** (The two edges of the skate blade) - While the two edges *allow* for turning, the passage states it's the *curve* that initiates the turn by digging into the ice.
* **C: Ti pakabuklan a lebel ti paglaingan ti skater** (The skater's overall skill level) - Skill is important, but the passage focuses on the *mechanism* of turning, not the skater's ability.
* **D: Ti kalidad ti yelo** (The quality of the ice) - Ice quality affects skating, but it's not the primary reason for turning as described in the text.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a mangiladawan iti abut iti tadem ti moderno nga ice skate?","The correct answer is **B: Nagkurba**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gapu ta iti baba ti tadem ket **apagapaman a nagkurba**, agirig ti tadem iti maysa a bangir wenno iti sabali a bangir..."" (Because the bottom of the blade is **always curved**, the blade tilts to one side or the other...). This curved bottom is what allows skaters to turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dua a igid** (Two sides) - While the blade has two sides, the passage focuses on the *shape* of the bottom edge, not just the presence of sides.
*   **C: Concave** - While ""concave"" describes a curve, the passage doesn't specifically use that term to describe the blade.
*   **D: Nagkiling** (Slanted) -  The blade *becomes* slanted when it tilts, but the fundamental characteristic is its curve.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti proseso a mangipalubos kadagiti atomo a mangikkat iti sobra nga enerhia manipud iti lawag?","The correct answer is **D: Natignay a panangiruar ti radiasion**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Awagan dagiti sientista daytoy a proseso a “natignay a panangiruar ti radiasion” gapu ta dagiti atomo ket natignay bayat ti nalawag a silaw..."" (Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"" because atoms are excited by light...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radiasion:** While radiation *is* involved, it's not the *process* itself. It's a broader category.
* **B: Natignay a panangiruar dagiti photon:** This describes *how* the process happens (atoms emit photons), but not the name of the process.
* **C: Photon:** A photon is a particle of light, not the process of releasing energy.



"
Ania ti mangigapu iti atomo a mangiruar ti photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagtignay gapu iti nalawag a silaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dagiti atomo ket natignay bayat ti nalawag a silaw, paggapuan ti iruruar ti photon iti silaw..."" This directly links the emission of photons to the *excitation* of atoms by light. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panangiruar iti surok nga enerhia** - While the passage mentions needing to release excess energy, it doesn't say this *causes* the photon emission, but rather is what *happens* during the process.
*   **C: Di natalged a lebel ti enerhia** - The passage discusses returning to a previous energy level, not a non-excited state as a *cause* of emission.
*   **D: Maysa a dakes a reaksion iti radiasion** - The passage describes a natural process of atoms interacting with light, not a dark/negative reaction to radiation.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti pakaigapuan inton agangay nga agbalin ti bombilia?","The correct answer is **C: Ti filament iti uneg ti bombilia a mapupuoran**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalpasan ti ginasut nga oras ti operasion ti linabag ti bombilia, agangay a mapuoran ket saanen nga agbalin ti silaw a bombilia.""  This directly translates to ""After hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb's filament will burn out and the bulb will no longer light up.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saan nga umiso ti pannakaiddep ti fixture iti silaw** (The fixture isn't properly grounded) - The passage talks about grounding as a *safety* precaution against shock, not as the *reason* the bulb stops working.
*   **B: Ti kaadda ti metal a base ti bombilia iti paset laeng iti sulbongan** (The presence of a metal base of the bulb in only part of the socket) - This describes a dangerous situation, but not *why* a bulb burns out.
*   **D: Agbannayat ti panagayus ti kuriente iti sulbongan** (The current flow in the socket is decreasing) - While current flow is *necessary* for a bulb to work, the passage doesn't say a decrease in current *causes* it to burn out, but rather that the filament itself fails.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mabalin a napeggad a sagiden bayat ti panangsukat iti bombilia?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti base ti bombilia (The base of the bulb)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the metal parts of the bulb base can give you a severe electric shock if touched while the switch is on or the bulb is still connected. The warning focuses on the base being a potential source of electrical current.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti filament (The filament):** While the filament is essential for the bulb to work, the passage doesn't warn about touching it directly causing a shock.
*   **B: Ti switch ti silaw (The light switch):** The passage mentions turning the switch *off* as a safety precaution, but doesn't say the switch itself is a shock hazard to touch.
*   **D: Ti kable (The cable):** The passage mentions disconnecting the cable as a safety measure, but the primary warning is about the bulb base itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mapasamak no mabingay ti nucleus?","The correct answer is **B: Mangiparuar iti enerhia** (Releases energy).

The passage states: ""Ti panangsina manen iti nucleus ket mangiparuar iti dadduma kadagita nga enerhia."" which directly translates to ""Splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magun-od dagiti proton** (Protons are obtained) - While protons *are* part of the nucleus, the passage doesn't say they are *obtained* when it splits.
*   **C: Agbalin a di natalged dagiti atomo** (Atoms become unstable) - The passage doesn't mention instability as a result of fission.
*   **D: Mapukaw dagiti neutron** (Neutrons are lost) -  While neutrons can be released during fission, the primary point of the passage is the *release of energy*.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangipakita kadagiti atiddog a distansia nga awag nga agsubli nga agpababa iti Daga,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti sattelite**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti sattelite iti law-ang ti mangala iti awagmo sa insigida nga ibatona met laeng iti daga."" (The satellite in space receives your call and immediately transmits it to Earth). This directly links satellites to long-distance calls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti teleskopio (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used to *observe* light, not transmit calls.
* **C: Dagiti lawag (Lights):** Light is what can be obscured by the atmosphere, but doesn't facilitate communication.
* **D: Dagiti rocket (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, but aren't involved in the actual communication process.



"
Ania kadagitoy ti mausar a mangikabil iti teleskopio iti law-ang?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti rocket**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Naipan ti satellite iti law-ang babaen ti maysa a rocket."" (Satellites are launched into space by a rocket.) And it also mentions that telescopes are launched similarly: ""Kasapulan ti higante a rocket a nasurok a 100 kadapan ti katayagna tapno makaipan iti satellite wenno teleskopio iti law-ang."" (A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti silnag ti lawag (Rays of light)** - Light is *observed* by telescopes, not used to launch them.
*   **C: Ti atmospera ti lubong (The Earth's atmosphere)** - The atmosphere *interferes* with telescopes, which is why they are placed in space.
*   **D: Dagiti sattelite a nasurok a 100 feet ti kangatona (Satellites over 100 feet tall)** - While satellites are launched, they aren't the *tool* used for launching telescopes. Rockets are.



"
Ania ti rumbeng a maipalagip maipapan iti sikliko a pasamak tapno masurot ti panaglabas ti panawen?,"The correct answer is **B: Panangulit-ulit** (Repetition).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti siklikal a pasamak ket isu kanayun a maulit-ulit a pasamak."" (A cyclical event is one that repeatedly happens.)  This directly links cyclical events to the idea of *repetition* as a way to mark the passage of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kinabayag** (Duration) - While duration is *related* to time, the passage defines cyclical events *as a method to measure* duration, not what defines a cyclical event itself.
*   **C: Affect** (Affect) - This is unrelated to the definition of a cyclical event.
*   **D: Rigat** (Difficulty) - The passage mentions time being difficult to understand, but this doesn't define a cyclical event.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga aspeto ti maysa a pasamak ti mausar ti panawen a mangidilig?","The correct answer is **A: Kaatiddog**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti oras ket no kasano met nga iyasping ti kinabayag (kaatiddog) dagiti mapaspasamak."" This directly translates to ""Time is how we measure the duration (length) of events."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangulit-ulit (Repetition):** While the passage *mentions* cyclical/repeating events as a way to *observe* the passage of time, it doesn't say repetition *defines* how time is measured.
* **C: Kapadasan (Similarity):**  The passage doesn't discuss similarity.
* **D: Affect (Impact):** The passage mentions time *affects* everything, but doesn't say impact is how it's measured.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maibilang a gagangay para iti agtawid iti trono?","The correct answer is **D: Mapan iti unibersidad sakbay a sumrek iti militar**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kas kadawyan, ti agtawid iti trono ket mapan a diretso iti militar no malpasnan ti ageskuela."" (Normally, those in line for the throne go directly into the military after finishing school.)
* **Then it contrasts this with Charles:**  ""Ngem, napan ni Charles iti unibersidad..."" (But Charles went to university...) This highlights that *going to university first* was a departure from the usual path.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** A 2:2 degree isn't presented as a requirement. It's just Charles's grade.
* **B:** The passage states the *usual* path is *not* going to university first.
* **C:** Studying History is not presented as a requirement for inheriting the throne.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ni Charles ti immuna a nangaramid iti ania?","The correct answer is **C: Mangala iti digri**.

The passage specifically states: ""Ni Charles ti umuna a miembro ti Royal a Pamilia a Briton a nakaawat iti digri."" (Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to earn a degree.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sumali iti militar sakbay a malpas ti panageskuela** - The passage states the *usual* path is to go directly to the military, but Charles did *not* follow that path.
*   **B: Mangadal ti Arkeolohia** - While he *did* study Archaeology, the question asks what he was the *first* to do.
*   **D: Agadal iti Trinity College** - Again, he did study there, but it wasn't a first for a royal family member.



"
Ania a pagilian ti naggapuan ti bunggoy ni Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text explicitly states: ""Daytoy a bunggoy ket indauluan ni Olaf Trygvasson, maysa a Norwegian nga adda ambisionna..."" which translates to ""This force was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambition..."" 

Therefore, Trygvasson came from Norway.



"
Iti ania a tiempo iti pakasaritaan a nangipaay ti Germany iti napigsa nga kultural nga impluwensia ti Estonia?,"The correct answer is **A: Agarup 200 a tawenen ti napalabas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the influence was in the 15th century.**  The 15th century was roughly 600 years ago (from 2023). However, the passage focuses on the *beginning* of the development of the Estonian language *due to* German influence. It doesn't state the influence lasted 600 years.
* **The passage focuses on the 15th century and the initial development of the Estonian language.** This suggests a concentrated period of influence rather than a long, drawn-out one.  200 years ago isn't quite accurate as it doesn't align with the 15th century, but it's the closest option as it represents a significant period of cultural impact beginning in that era.



"
Ti pagsasao nga Estonian ket naimpluensiaan ti ania?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti alpabeto ti German**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Estonian language was *based* on the German alphabet. While the other options are mentioned in the text, they aren't the direct influence on the language's *structure* in the way the alphabet is.

*   **A: Ti karakter nga Õ/õ** - This is a *result* of the influence, not the influence itself.
*   **C: Dagiti German a monghe** - They were the agents *using* the German alphabet, but the alphabet is the direct influence.
*   **D: Dios** -  Mentioned in the context of the monks' piety, but not a linguistic influence.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, agbaliwbaliw ti bilang dagiti katutubo nga agsasao iti Hindi base iti ania a banag?","The correct answer is **A: No dagiti dialekto nga umasping unay iti Hindi ket mabilbilang**.

The text states: ""Ti bilang dagiti katutubo ket mabalin nga agbaliw depende no maibilang dagiti daddumapay nga agiinnasideg a dialekto."" This directly translates to ""The number of native speakers may change depending on whether closely related dialects are counted.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: No mabilbilang dagiti agsasao iti Urdu:** The text mentions Hindi and Urdu are similar but written differently. Counting Urdu speakers doesn't change the *native* Hindi speaker count.
* **C: No mabilbilang dagiti tattao a makaawat iti pagsasao:**  The text differentiates between speakers and those who *understand* the language - it's the speaker count that varies.
* **D: No mabilbilang dagiti tattao a makabasa iti pagsasao:**  The text doesn't mention reading ability as a factor in the speaker count.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pudno a keddeng maipapan dagiti lengguahe a Hindi ken Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Agduduma ti iskripda** (They differ in script).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agpada ti bokabulario ti Hindi ken Urdu ngem agdumada iti pannakaisurat"" which translates to ""Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but differ in writing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gagangay nga adda pannakadiskonekta dagiti agsasao iti agpada a lengguahe** (Speakers of the same language generally have difficulty understanding each other) - The passage says they *easily* understand each other.
*   **C: Agpada dagitoy iti bokabulario ken iskrip** (They are the same in vocabulary and script) - The passage states they differ in script.
*   **D: Agduduma ti bokabularioda** (They differ in vocabulary) - The passage states their vocabulary is *similar*.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga umiso a kinapudno maipapan iti alpabeto a Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **D: Nairanta a naimbento dayta**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Hangeul was invented in 1444**, during the reign of King Sejong. This means it was *not* invented early in his reign.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Naimbento dayta idi rugi ti panagturay ni Ari Sejong** - This is incorrect as it was invented *during* his reign, not at the beginning.
* **B: Ti orihinal a nagan ti alpabeto ket Hunan Jeongeum** - The passage explicitly states the original name was *Hunmin Jeongeum*.
* **C: Inimbento dayta ti maikauppat nga ari ti Dinastia ti Joseon** - The passage confirms King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and invented Hangeul.



"
Ti alpabeto a Hunmin Jeongeum ket nabaliwan kamaudiananna iti ania?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Tii orihinal nga impanagannana iti alpabeto a Hangeul ket Hunmin Jeongeum..."" This directly translates to ""The alphabet was originally named Hunmin Jeongeum, which later became known as Hangeul...""



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti pagsasao a naimpluensiaan babaen ti Sanskrito?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti pagsasao ti Indiano**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti Sanskrit ket kumplikado ken nabaknang a pagsasao, nga isu ti agserserbi a naggapuanan ti adu a moderno a pagsasao ti Indiano..."" (Sanskrit is a complex and rich language, serving as the source of many modern Indian languages...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti pagsasao ti Latin** - While the passage *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, it doesn't say Sanskrit influenced Latin.
* **B: Dagiti pagsasao ti Europa** - The passage says Latin influenced European languages, not Sanskrit.
* **C: Dagiti pagsasao ti Kadaanan** - This is too broad. The passage focuses on the influence on Indian languages.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti pannakausar ti Sanskrito ket bimmassit gapu iti ania?","The correct answer is **D: Hirarkia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalpasan a naurnong dagiti Upanishad, nagawan lattaniti Sanskrit gapu iti hirarkia."" (After the Upanishads were learned, Sanskrit became less used due to hierarchy.) 

This directly links the decrease in Sanskrit usage to the emergence of a hierarchical structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kinakumplikado (Complicated):** While the passage states Sanskrit *is* complex, it doesn't say this *caused* its decreased use.
* **B: Panagakar ti Aryan (Aryan Invasion):** The passage mentions the Aryan migration as a theory about Sanskrit's origins, but not as a reason for its decline.
* **C: Dagiti pagsasao ti Latin (Latin Languages):** Latin languages are used as a comparison to understand Sanskrit's influence, not as a reason for its decreased usage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a keddeng maipapan iti grabidad iti Io?","The correct answer is **A: Basbassit ti mangguyod kenka ti grabidad ti lubong ngem ti grabidad ni Io**.

Here's why:

The passage states that you would weigh less on Io (36 lbs) compared to Earth (200 lbs). This directly indicates that Io has *less* gravitational pull than Earth. Therefore, the gravity of Earth pulls on you *more* than the gravity of Io.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage explicitly states Io has *less* gravity, so it wouldn't pull you more.
* **C:**  Less gravity means less weight, not more.
* **D:** The passage demonstrates the opposite - Earth's gravity is stronger.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan iti makinruar a rabaw ti Bulan?","The correct answer is **B: Naingpis ti crust iti sirok dagiti nangato a daga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Naing-ingpis iti sirok ti maria ken napuspuskol iti sirok ti nangato a daga."" (It is thin at the edge of the maria and thick at the edge of the highlands.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti asideg a bangirna ket addaan iti napuspuskol a crust** - The passage says the *far side* has a thicker crust (100km) than the near side (70km).
* **C: Mabalin a basbassit ti maria iti adayo a bangir** - The passage doesn't explicitly state whether there are few maria on the far side, only that the crust is thicker there.
* **D: Mabalin a basbassit ti maria iti sirok dagiti nangato a daga** - The passage states the crust is *thick* at the edge of the highlands, but doesn't say anything about the amount of maria there.  In fact, it implies maria are *near* thinner crust.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadino ti kapuskolan a paset ti crust ti Bulan?","The correct answer is **C: Iti sirok dagiti nangato a daga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Naing-ingpis iti sirok ti maria ken **napuspuskol iti sirok ti nangato a daga**."" (It is thin at the edge of the maria and **thick at the edge of the highlands**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti asideg ti igidna** - While maria are more common near the side facing Earth, the passage doesn't say the crust is *thickest* there. It says it's *thinner* there.
*   **B: Idiay ad-adu ti maria** -  The passage states the opposite - the crust is thinner where there are maria.
*   **D: Iti sirok ti maria** -  The passage explicitly says the crust is *thinner* at the edge of the maria.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti patien ti sumagmamano a tattao?","The correct answer is **C: Adda ti biag iti dadduma a planeta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dadduma a tattao ket agpanpanunot no ania ti adda idiay sumagmamano ti mamati nga adda ti alien wenno sabali a biag iti sabali a planeta."" This directly translates to ""some people wonder what is out there, some believe there is alien life or other life on another planet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti tattao ket napan iti sabali a bituen** - The passage says people *may be able* to travel to other stars, but it's not something that is currently happening or a settled belief.
*   **B: Saan a kabaelan dagiti tattao ti agsukisok iti dadduma a lubong** - The passage doesn't state that it's *impossible* to explore other worlds, only that it's distant.
*   **D: Adda nakurang a trilion a milia iti nagbaetan dagiti bituen** - While the passage mentions trillions of miles, it's describing the *distance* between stars, not a lack of mileage.



"
Ania ti agbalin a naingpis bayat nga ad-adda nga umakarka manipud iti tengnga ti Init?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas**.

The passage states: ""Uming-ingpis ti gas bayat nga umad-adayoka manipud iti sentro ti Init."" (Gas becomes thinner as it moves away from the center of the Sun).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Plasma:** While the Sun *is* made of plasma, the passage doesn't say plasma becomes thinner.
*   **B: Apuy:** ""Apuy"" (fire) is a general term and not specifically what thins out.
*   **D: Crust:** The passage states the crust is like Earth's, but doesn't mention it becoming thinner as you move from the center.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a paset ti init ti makita manipud iti Lubong?","The correct answer is **C: Ti photosphere**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ti akinruar a parte a makitatayo no kumitatayo iti Init ket maawagan iti photosphere, a kayatna a sawen ket “bola ti lawag”."" This directly translates to ""The outer part that we see when looking at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti crust:** The passage mentions a crust, but doesn't say it's visible.
* **B: Ti plasma:** While the Sun *is* made of plasma, it's not the part we see directly.
* **D: Ti sentro:** The center is deep inside the Sun and not visible.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a kapaliiwan ti nakatulong a mangpasingked iti teorya ni Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti paset iti Venus** (The phases of Venus).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti langlanga ti Venus ket suportaranna ti teoria ni Copernicus a dagiti planeta ket aglikaw iti Init."" (The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that planets revolve around the Sun.)  Galileo observing phases on Venus *proved* that Venus must orbit the Sun, as only a planet orbiting the Sun would exhibit a full range of phases like the Moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti transit ti Venus** (The transit of Venus) - While Horrocks observed a transit of Venus, the passage doesn't explicitly state *that* observation was the key factor in supporting Copernicus. It was Galileo's observation of the *phases* that did the heavy lifting. A transit is when a planet passes between the Earth and the Sun, and while interesting, it doesn't directly demonstrate a planet orbiting the sun.
* **C: Dagiti panagpapada ti Init ken ti Venus** (The similarities between the Sun and Venus) - The passage doesn't focus on similarities.
* **D: Dagiti panagpapada ti Init ken Bulan** (The similarities between the Sun and Moon) - The passage compares the phases of Venus *to* the Moon, but the important point is that Venus having phases like the moon supports heliocentrism, not similarities in themselves.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti napaliiw ni Galileo Galilei idi 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti paset iti Venus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""idi 1610, iti Italiano nga astronomer a ni Galileo Galilei ket nagusar ti teleskopio tapno makitana nga adda paset iti Venus..."" (in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to see that there are phases of Venus...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti paset ti Bulan a nakasango iti Init** - The passage mentions phases *like* the moon, but Galileo observed the phases of Venus, not the illuminated part of the moon.
* **C: Aglikaw ti planeta iti Init** -  Galileo's observations *supported* the theory of planets revolving around the Sun (Copernicus' theory), but he didn't *observe* this directly. He observed phases, which provided evidence for the theory.
* **D: Ti transit ti Venus** - Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti pagurnongan ti Karayan ti Amazon iti danum?","The correct answer is **A: Babbabassit a karayan**.

The passage states: ""Unongenna dagiti danum nga aggapu iti nadumaduma pay a babassit a karayan."" This means the Amazon River *collects* water from many smaller rivers. Therefore, its source of water is smaller rivers.



"
Ania a pammadayaw ti saan a nainaig iti Karayan Amazon?,"The correct answer is **A: Dayta ti maikadua a kaatiddog a karayan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti Karayan Amazon ti maikadua a kaatiddogan ken ti kadadakkelan a karayan iti Daga."" (The Amazon River is the *second longest* and the largest river on Earth.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dayta ti kadakkelan a karayan** - The passage confirms this is true.
* **C: Dayta ti kaatiddogan a karayan** - The passage states it's the *second* longest.
* **D: Dayta ti kalawaan a karayan** - The passage confirms this is true.



"
Ania a linia ti trabaho a nadakamat iti paset ti mangab-abang iti kabassitan a bilang dagiti taga-Venezuela?,"The correct answer is **A: Agrikultura**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""kalima ti agob-obra iti agrikultura"" which translates to ""one-fifth of the workforce is in agriculture."" This is the smallest proportion mentioned compared to:

*   ""Dua a kakatlo"" (two-thirds) in services
*   ""dandani kakapat"" (roughly one-fourth) in industry
*   ""Maysa a porsiento"" (one percent) in oil.

Therefore, agriculture employs the smallest number of Venezuelans."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a sektor ti mangab-abang iti kaaduan a bilang dagiti taga-Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Serbisio**.

The passage states: ""Dua a kakatlo kadagiti Venezuelan nga agob-obra ti adda iti sektor ti serbisio..."" (Two-thirds of Venezuelan workers are in the service sector...). This clearly indicates that the service sector employs the most Venezuelans.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti ipalubos ti fusion nga aramiden dagiti bituen?","The correct answer is **C: Mangiparuar iti lawag ken pudot** (To emit light and heat).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti bituen ket mangted iti sillag ken pudot gapu iti enerhia a naaramid no dagiti hydrogen atomo ket agtipon..."" (Stars give off light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms come together...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mangporma kadagiti nadagdagsen nga elemento** (To form heavier elements) - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the passage states light and heat are the *result* of the fusion process, not the purpose.
* **B: Mangaramid kadagiti fusion reactor** (To create fusion reactors) - The passage says scientists *are trying* to create reactors, but fusion itself doesn't create them.
* **D: Mangparnuay kadagiti hydrogen nga atomo** (To destroy hydrogen atoms) - The passage says hydrogen atoms *come together* (agtipon), not are destroyed.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti patauden ti makatulong a fusion reactor?,"The correct answer is **A: Hydrogen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that fusion happens when **hydrogen atoms** combine to create heavier elements and release energy. A fusion reactor aims to replicate this process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bitbituen (Stars):** Stars *use* fusion, they don't fuel a fusion reactor.
* **C: Dagiti atomo (Atoms):** While fusion involves atoms, it's specifically *hydrogen* atoms that are key to the process described.
* **D: Enerhia (Energy):** Energy is *produced* by fusion, but it isn't what fuels the reactor.



"
Ania ti kemikal a pakabuklan ti danum?,"The correct answer is **D: Dua nga atomo ti hydrogen ken maysa nga atomo ti oksiheno**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti compound a danum ket addaan iti dua nga atomo iti hidroheno ken maysa nga atomo iti oksiheno."" (The compound water has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.)



"
"Inton agbaliw ti porma ti danum, ania ti agtalinaed a kas iti dati?","The correct answer is **A: Molekular nga istruktura**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti compound a danum ket addaan iti dua nga atomo iti hidroheno ken maysa nga atomo iti oksiheno. Addaan daytoy iti agpada a molekular nga istruktura no man pay daytoy ket maysa a gas, likido wenno solido."" (The compound water has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. It has the same molecular structure whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kadagsen (Density):** Density changes as water changes state (ice is less dense than liquid water).
* **C: Pisikal a kasasaad (Physical state):**  The physical state *changes* (gas, liquid, solid). That's the whole point of the passage – the *form* changes, but something remains constant.
* **D: Likido a nitrogen (Liquid nitrogen):** Liquid nitrogen is mentioned as an example of a change of state, but it's not what stays the same with water.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a parikut iti sangapulo ket tallo nga estado idi padpadasenda nga ipabaklay ti sumagmamano a linteg?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti enmienda a kasapulan ti agtutunos a pananganamong** (Amendments requiring unanimous consent).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kasapulan dagiti Artikulo ti napagkaykaysaan ti amin a pammalubos manipud kadagiti amin nga estado sakbay a mabaliwan dagitoy..."" This directly translates to ""The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed...""  This made amending the Articles extremely difficult and a significant weakness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nadagsen a panangimaton manipud kadagiti autoridad ti estado (Strong authority from state governments):** The passage *describes* this as a problem - that states retained too much authority. It wasn't a difficulty in *enacting* laws, but a difficulty in enforcing them *because* of state authority.
* **B: Awan ti bileg iti uneg ti Kongreso (Lack of power within Congress):** The passage explicitly states Kongreso lacked the power to tax and effectively enforce laws. This *was* a problem.
* **D: Maysa nga awan a nasional nga ehekutibo (Absence of a national executive):** The passage also points this out as a weakness – the lack of an executive branch hampered governance.



Therefore, the passage highlights the difficulty of amending the Articles of Confederation due to the requirement of unanimous consent as a core issue."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiyanninaw iti kasasaad ti gobierno sentral bayat ti Rebolusionario a Gubat?","The correct answer is **D: Buklen ti gobierno sentral ti dua a kangrunaan a paset**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""nangbukel dagiti sangapulo-ket-tallo nga estado iti nakapsut a sentral a gobierno—Kongreso laeng ti adda a pasetna—iti babaen ti Artikulo ti Konpederasion."" This directly indicates the central government consisted of only Congress, making it two parts (the states and Congress).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage explicitly states Congress *lacked* the power to effectively levy taxes.
* **B:** The passage states changes to the Articles required unanimous consent, hindering Congress's power.
* **C:** The passage states the need for unanimous consent *from* the states, meaning states *had* a presence and influence.



"
Kasano a naisurat dagiti balikas iti likud ti Deklarasion ti Independensia?,"The correct answer is **C: Nabaliktad**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iti surat ket agparang idiay baba ti dokumento, **nakabaliktad**."" (The writing appears at the bottom of the document, **inverted**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti dakkel a letra** - The passage doesn't mention the size of the writing.
*   **B: Iti code** - The passage explicitly states it's not a treasure map, implying it's not a code.
*   **D: Iti bassit a letra** - The passage doesn't mention the size of the writing.



"
Agdindinamag ti Singapore gapu iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **A: Berde ti siudad** (Green city).

**Explanation:**

The passage states that experts from the Botanic Gardens in Singapore helped transform the island into a tropical Garden City. This directly relates to Singapore being known for its greenery and focus on plants and gardens. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panag-hiking** (Hiking) - While Singapore has some hiking trails, it's not the primary reason it's famous.
* **C: Adbentura nga isports** (Adventure sports) - Singapore offers some adventure sports, but it isn't its defining characteristic.
* **D: Arte ti panagpabuya** (Art of photography) -  Photography is popular, but not the main reason for Singapore's fame.



"
Ania ti Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a sabong** (A flower).

The passage explicitly states: ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, maysa nga adda laokna nga orkidia, ket napili kas nasional a sabong iti pagilian."" (Vanda Miss Joaquim, a local orchid, was chosen as the national flower of the country.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa nga isla** (An island) - The passage mentions the *island* of Singapore, but Vanda Miss Joaquim is not an island.
*   **C: Maysa a botanikal a hardin** (A botanical garden) - The Botanic Gardens are where the experts are *from*, but Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower *within* a garden.
*   **D: Maysa a nasional a monumento** (A national monument) - While it's a national symbol, it's specifically identified as the national *flower*, not a monument.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kalidad dagiti piramid ti Giza ti saan la ketdi a pagsiddaawan dagiti Baro a Pagarian ti Ehipto?","The correct answer is **A: Ti edadda** (The age).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nasdaaw dagiti nagkauna nga Egyptian ti Baro a Pagarian kadagiti monumento dagiti immun-una kadakuada, nga idi ket agedad iti nasurok a sangaribun a tawen."" (The early Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.)

This clearly indicates that the *age* of the Giza pyramids was something the New Kingdom Egyptians recognized and respected. The passage doesn't say they were impressed by the stone used, size, or craftsmanship to a degree that they tried to surpass it - rather, they *admired* what was already there, acknowledging its great age.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti panagusar iti bato** (The use of stone) - The passage mentions stone being used in pyramid construction generally, but doesn't suggest the New Kingdom Egyptians were particularly impressed by this aspect of the Giza pyramids.
* **C: Ti kadakkelda** (Their size) - The passage states the pyramids of Giza were not surpassed in size.
* **D: Ti pannakaaramidda** (Their craftsmanship) - The passage states the pyramids of Giza were not surpassed in craftsmanship.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti pagdaliasatan dagiti agar-arab nga animal tapno surotenda dagiti tudo?","The correct answer is **C: Ti makin-abagatan a tanap** (The southern plains).

Here's why:

The text states the animals travel *from the highlands in the north to the south* (""dandani 1.5 milion nga agar-arab nga animal manipud iti kabambantayan iti amianan ti mapan iti kapanagan iti abagatan"") to be where the grass is for grazing (""tapno addada sadiay bayat ti panagtutudo"").  This means they are going to the southern plains to find grazing land.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti makindaya a tanap** (The eastern plains) - The text doesn't mention east/west movement as the primary direction.
*   **B: Dagiti turod iti amianan** (The highlands in the north) - They *leave* the northern highlands, they don't go there to graze.
*   **D: Dagiti turod iti laud** (The highlands in the west) - The text mentions returning *northwest* but doesn't say they graze in the western highlands.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a lugar ti pumanaw dagiti agar-arab nga animal no dadduma iti agarup Abril?","The correct answer is **A: Ti rehion ti Serengeti**.

Here's why:

The text states the animals *return* to the north (mapan laud) *after* the rainy season (malpas ti tudo banda iti Abril). This northward return is to the Serengeti region (Lalaonen iti rehion ti Serengeti...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti makin-abagatan a tanap:** The animals *leave* the southern plains in October, they don't return there in April.
*   **C: Ti Karayan Mara:** They cross the Mara River both going south and returning north. It's a crossing point, not a final destination.
*   **D: Nasional nga Reserba iti Maasai Mara:** While part of their migration route, they are moving *away* from the Maasai Mara in April, towards the Serengeti.



"
Ti Operation Sealion ket panangraut iti ania a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **B: Britania**.

The text states: ""...nangrugin nga agsagana ti Alemania a mangraut iti isla ti Britania. Inikkan ti Germany iti code name ti panagatake nga “Operation Sealion”.""  This directly translates to ""Germany began to plan to invade the island of Britain. Germany gave the attack the code name “Operation Sealion”.""



"
Ania ti awag ti Germany iti panangraut iti Britania?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Inikkan ti Germany iti code name ti panagatake nga “Operation Sealion”."" (Germany gave the code name for the attack as ""Operation Sealion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk** - Dunkirk was a location where the British army *retreated from*, not the name of the attack.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine** - This is the name of the *German Navy*, not the attack itself.
*   **D: Royal Navy** - This is the *British Navy*, not the German attack.



"
Ania ti saan a nadakamat kas kasapulan nga addang iti plano ti Italia a mangtiliw kadagiti pagilian ti Africa?,"The correct answer is **C: Panangipasdek iti troop launching pad**.

Here's why:

The passage states Italy needs to control bases in British Egypt to reach Africa. It also mentions they only built four new ships before the war and don't need to build more warships.  It specifically focuses on taking bases and controlling the Mediterranean sea lanes. A ""troop launching pad"" (a place to begin a land invasion) isn't mentioned as a requirement in the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panangikkat kadagiti barko idiay Ehipto** - The passage *explicitly* states Italy needs to take bases and ships in Egypt.
*   **B: Panagaramid kadagiti kanayonan a barko** - The passage notes they've already built a few ships and don't *need* to build more.
*   **D: Panangdadael kadagiti base ti Britania** - Controlling British bases in Egypt is stated as a necessity; damaging them isn't specifically mentioned, though it could be implied.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naibilang a kangrunaan a panggep ti Italia iti gubat?","The correct answer is **A: Kemmegen dagiti pagilian iti Africa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti kangrunaan a kayat ti Italia ket dagiti pagilian idiay Africa."" (The main goal of Italy is the countries in Africa.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangbangon iti napigpigsa a buyot ken navy** - While the passage mentions Italy wanting a stronger fleet, it's a *means* to an end (conquering Africa), not the main goal itself.
* **C: Panangikkat kadagiti barko ti Ehipto** - Taking ships from Egypt is a step *towards* conquering Africa, not the goal.
* **D: Panangipasdek kadagiti base ti Britania** -  Taking British bases is also a step *towards* conquering Africa, not the goal.



"
Asinno ti nangipasdek iti nainggayyeman a relasion kadagiti manangraut?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti Pranses a Vichy**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Vichy"" French were French people who *collaborated* with the Germans in 1940, meaning they formed a relationship with the occupiers instead of fighting them. This is a direct indication of a close, though undesirable, relationship with the invaders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti German** - While the Germans were the initiating force, the question asks who *entered* into the relationship with the invaders.
*   **C: Dagiti Amerikano** - The Americans were fighting *against* the Germans and Vichy France, not collaborating with them.
*   **D: Dagiti Pranses a Nawaya** - The Free French were also fighting *against* the Germans and Vichy France.



"
Asinno dagiti Aliado a nairaman iti Operation Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti Amerikano ken Free French**.

The text explicitly states: ""pinaruk-atan dagiti Amerikano ken dagiiti puersa ti Free French ti abagatan ti France..."" (the Americans and the Free French forces landed in southern France...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says the Vichy French *collaborated* with the Germans, they didn't participate in the Allied operation.
* **C:** The Germans were the enemy, not part of the Allied forces.
* **D:**  Again, the Germans were the enemy.



"
Ti itatanor ti ania a teknolohia ti nakaigapuan ti panangrugi dagiti submarino nga agbiahe iti sirok ti danum?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Idi mabuo ti radar ken agbalbalinen a husto dagiti sabmarin ket napuersa a mapan iti uneg ti danum tapno saanda a makita."" This directly explains that the *development of radar* is what caused submarines to begin traveling underwater to avoid detection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boats** - U-Boats are *what* the German submarines were called, not the technology that changed their behavior.
*   **B: Range ti panagpaltog (Firing range)** - The passage mentions limited firing range as a drawback of early submarines, but it doesn't explain why they started diving.
*   **C: Panaglayag (Navigation)** - Navigation is important for submarines, but it doesn't explain *why* they began operating primarily underwater.



"
"Bayat ti damo a pannakausar dagitoy, limitado unay ti sakup dagiti submarino iti ania a lugar?","The correct answer is **C: Panagpaltog**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Idi a panawen, nakabumbuntog dagitoy ken **limitado la ti kaadayo ti madanon ti iputokda**.""  This directly refers to the limited *range of their weapons* (panagpaltog).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aglaylayag** - Refers to sailing or navigating, not range.
*   **B: Panagbiahe** - Refers to traveling, not range.
*   **D: Panag-operate** - Refers to operating the submarines, not range.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti nagsalungasing iti paglintegan iti ili? ","The correct answer is **D: Iti Soviets**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Soviet Union (Red Army) invaded Poland, breaking treaties and agreements. This act of invasion is what constitutes ""nagsalungasing iti paglintegan iti ili"" (opposed the independence of the country).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti Polish** - The Polish were *defending* their country, not opposing its independence.
*   **B: Iti Romanians** - While mentioned as a location for retreat, Romanians weren't the aggressors in this scenario.
*   **C: Iti Ukranians** - The passage states the Soviets created Ukrainian fronts *after* invading, but it doesn't say Ukrainians initiated the aggression.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad iti haan a maisaysayangkay ti Nalabbaga nga Army?,"The correct answer is **D: Iti panagsalungasing ti katulagan (Violating treaties)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ti Soviet Union ti simrek ken nangbukel kadagiti Belarussian ken Ukraine fronts kalpasan a rautenda ti dagiti akindaya a rehion ti Poland nga isu a linabsingda ti Riga Peace Treaty, ti Soviet-Polish Non-Aggresion Pact, ken dadduma pay nga internasional a katulagan..."" This directly translates to ""the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti panagparsua iti buyot ti Ukranian (Pursuing the Ukrainian border):** The passage doesn't mention specifically pursuing the Ukrainian border, only that they formed a Ukrainian front.
* **B: Iti panagdarup ti akindaya a dagdaga (Capturing eastern lands):** While the Soviets *did* capture eastern lands, the passage emphasizes the *violation of treaties* as the key element.
* **C: Iti panagplastar idiay bridgehead (Establishing a bridgehead):**  The passage mentions a Polish attempt to establish a bridgehead in Romania, not the Red Army.



"
Ania ti napasamak ti Panguluen nga Inhinyehro iti Maikasangapulo nga Army iti Italia?,"The correct answer is **C: Nakemmeg isuna iti Briton**.

The passage states: ""natiliw dagiti Briton iti Panguluen nga Inhinyero iti Maikasangapulo a Buyot iti Italia, ni Heneral Lastucci."" This translates to ""the British captured the Chief Engineer of the 10th Italian Army, General Lastucci.""  ""Natiliw"" means captured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nakemmeg isuna idiay Fort Capuzzo** - The passage says the fort was attacked, not that Lastucci was stationed there.
*   **B: Napapatay isuna idiay Tobruk** - Marshal Balbo was killed in Tobruk, not Lastucci.
*   **D: Napatay isuna iti mannakigayyem nga apuy** - Again, this refers to Marshal Balbo, not Lastucci."
Sadinno iti nakapatayan ni Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Idi Hunio 28, ni Marshal Italo Balbo, Gobernador-Heneral ti Libya ken agtawid kenni Mussolini, ket napapatay ti mannakigayyem nga apoy bayat nga agdisdisso idiay **Tobruk**."" 

Therefore, Italo Balbo was killed in Tobruk."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a panagpanpanunot iti imporatante a paset ti Tibetan a meditasion?","The correct answer is **C: Panangiladawan kadagiti didiosen (Visualizing deities)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Babaen iti bisualisasion ti nadumaduma a dios, madalusan dagiti pagdalanan ti enerhia, maparuk-atan dagiti dagiti chakra, ken maparnuay ti pannakalawlawag ti nakem."" (Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are reached, and enlightenment is nourished.)

While the passage *also* mentions exercises (A & D) and mantras (B) as part of Tibetan Buddhism, the visualization of deities is presented as central to the meditation process itself, specifically how it affects energy flow and enlightenment.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a mapaaktibo dagiti chakra bayat ti “sentro” ti meditasion ti Tibet?","The correct answer is **B: Babaen ti panangiladawan kadagiti didiosen**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Babaen iti bisualisasion ti nadumaduma a dios, madalusan dagiti pagdalanan ti enerhia, maparuk-atan dagiti dagiti chakra, ken maparnuay ti pannakalawlawag ti nakem.""  This directly links visualizing deities to activating the chakras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manipud iti nadumaduma nga postura ti yoga** - While Kundalini Yoga *includes* postures, the text says postures are used to *release* Kundalini energy, not directly activate chakras in meditation.
*   **C: Iti panagulit kadagiti mantra** - Mantras are mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, but the text doesn't directly connect them to chakra activation *within the meditation itself*.
*   **D: Panagsanay iti ehesisio ti panaganges** - Breathing exercises are part of Kundalini Yoga, similar to postures, and contribute to energy flow, but aren’t the primary method for chakra activation during meditation according to the text.



"
Asinno iti nangidaulo ti maikadua a kanta para kadagiti deboto kabayatan iti programa?,"The correct answer is **B: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Impresenta met ni Lakkha Singh ti chhappan bhog bhajan. Kinaduaan isuna ni kumakanta a ni Raju Khandelwal."" This means Lakkha Singh *presented* the Chhappan Bhog bhajan, and Raju Khandelwal sang *with* him. Since he presented it, he led the song. Later, the text also says ""Kinanta pay ni Lakkha Singh ti chhappan bhog bhajan. Dinanggayan isuna ti kumakanta a ni Raju Khandelwal"", implying he led it again.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sanju Sharma:** He sang *first*, not second.
*   **C: Raju Khandelwal:** He sang *with* Lakkha Singh, but didn't lead.
*   **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He sang after Sanju Sharma, but not the second bhajan.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti nangidaulo ti maikadua a kanta para kadagiti deboto kabayatan iti panangited ti kanen?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kalpasanna, sinublat ni Lakkha Singh ti panangidaulo iti panagkanta iti bhajans."" This means Lakkha Singh led the singing of bhajans *after* the Chhappan Bhog (food offering) was presented.  It also states he sang the Chhappan Bhog bhajan and was joined by Raju Khandelwal, meaning he led that specific song related to the food offering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He sang *after* Sanju Sharma, but not in connection with the food offering.
* **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity being worshipped, not a singer.
* **D: Sanju Sharma:** He was the first singer, before the food offering was mentioned.



"
Ania iti maikadua iti maudi a pabuya iti rabii?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina ken Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti Turkish a diva a ni Sezen Aksu ket nagpabuya a kaduana ti tenor nga Italiano a ni Alesssandro Safina ken ti kumakanta a Griego a ni Haris Alexiou."" This directly answers the question of who performed second to last.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Apuy iti Anatolia** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Agpuspusipos a Dervishes** - The Whirling Dervishes performed earlier in the show.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç ken Müslüm Gürses** - They performed earlier with the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra.



"
Ania iti pannakipagili ni Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Italiano**.

The text states: ""Ti Turkish a diva a ni Sezen Aksu ket nagpabuya a kaduana ti tenor nga **Italiano** a ni Alesssandro Safina..."" which translates to ""The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with the **Italian** tenor Alessandro Safina...""



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng iti haan a pudno?","The correct answer is **A: Adda napuoran idiay Santa Clara** (There was a fire in Santa Clara).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nabara nga aldaw idiay Santa Clara nga adda temperaturana a mapan a 90s"" which translates to ""It was a hot day in Santa Clara with temperatures in the 90s."" This refers to the *weather* being hot, not a fire.
* **B: Naipit dagitay tattao idiay roller coaster** (People were stuck on the roller coaster) - This is **TRUE**. The passage explicitly states people were stuck for at least an hour.
* **C: Naikkan ti danum dagiti pasahero** (Passengers were given water) - This is **TRUE**. The first sentence states water was given to passengers.
* **D: Nagpaut iti kababaan ti 60 a minutos tapno maikkat ti immuna a tao iti pagluganan** (It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person off the ride) - This is **TRUE**. The passage states it took ""at least an hour"" to get the first person off.



Therefore, the only statement not supported by the text is that there was a fire in Santa Clara."
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno iti nangdillaw iti haan a nanam-ay a pudot?","The correct answer is **C: Iti pasaheros**.

Here's why:

The passage states the passengers were uncomfortable due to the heat while stuck on the roller coaster.  Scout Kouns (the fire captain) *explained* the discomfort, but the *passengers* were the ones experiencing it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti mangtartarawidwid iti pagluganan** - While they were stuck *on* the ride, the passage doesn't say they felt the heat.
*   **B: Iti kapitan ti puor** - Scout Kouns observed the heat and explained the situation, but wasn't suffering from it himself.
*   **D: Iti kapitan ti pulis** - The police captain isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Sadinno a luglugar iti naawanan ti kuriente gapu iti napasamak a tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Awan iti dakkel a dadael wenno dagiti nadangran a naipadamag idiay Tonga, ngem temporario a nagpukaw ti elektrisidad..."" (There was no major damage or injuries in Tonga, but there was a temporary power outage...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Niue:** The passage only mentions that tsunamis were *recorded* near Niue, not that it experienced any effects like a power outage.
*   **C: Dagiti pagadalan idiay Hawaii:** Schools in Hawaii were *closed* as a precaution, but the passage doesn't say they lost power.
*   **D: Pago Pago:** Similar to Niue, Pago Pago just had tsunamis recorded nearby, no effects were mentioned.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a naapektaran iti pagilian ti Tonga iti panagawan ti kuriente?","The correct answer is **A: Adda sagmamano a dadael iti naipadamag** (There was some damage caused).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Awan iti dakkel a dadael wenno dagiti nadangran a naipadamag idiay Tonga, ngem temporario a nagpukaw ti elektrisidad...""  This directly translates to ""There was no major damage or injuries in Tonga, but there was a temporary power outage...""  A power outage *is* a form of damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Awan naawat ti autoridad a damag maipanggep kadagiti naikkat a pakdaar** (The authorities did not receive damage regarding the elevated warnings) - The text says the power outage *caused* the authorities to have trouble receiving the tsunami warnings, not that they didn't receive damage.
* **C: Ti basa iti pantar ti baybay ket naapektaran** (The sea level gauge was affected) - While the sea level gauge detected the tsunami, the text doesn't say it was *affected* (damaged).
* **D: Dagiti autoridad ket haan a nakaawat iti napnuan ti pateg a pakdaar** (The authorities did not receive a fully valuable warning) - The text says they had trouble *receiving* the warning *because* of the power outage, not that the warning itself was inadequate.

Sadinno nausar iti pulis dagitay paltog a radar da tapno maorasan iti kinapaspas ti panagmaneho ni Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **C: Kanito iti panagmaneho na ti nasurok 160 km/h**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iti polis ti New Zealand ket addaan ti yengyengna ti panagusarda ti paltog a speed radar tapno makita no kasano ti kinapartak ni Mr Reid gapu ta kasta kababa ti Black Beauty, ken ti kanito a naorasan ti pulis ni Mr Reid ket idi bimmuntog isuna ti 160km/h.""  This directly translates to ""The New Zealand police had permission to use speed radar guns to see how fast Mr. Reid was going because Black Beauty was so fast, and the police timed Mr. Reid when he reached 160km/h.""

* **A** is incorrect because the police timed him *at* 160km/h, not just when he was driving 160km/h.
* **B** and **D** are irrelevant details – the location of the pass on the bridge isn’t why the radar was used.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a narigatan ti pulis iti New Zealand nga orasan ti kinapartak ni Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Agmanmaneho isuna iti paspas ti 160 km/h**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""ti kanito a naorasan ti pulis ni Mr Reid ket idi bimmuntog isuna ti 160km/h."" (the police timed Mr. Reid when he reached 160km/h). This directly explains why it was difficult for the police to time his speed - it was very fast!

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pudno unay ti buntog iti lugan** - The text doesn’t mention anything about the height being a problem.
*   **C: Naminpito laeng a nagmaneho iti rangtay** - The fact he was the only one driving doesn’t affect the ability to time his speed.
*   **D: Daan unay ti Rangtay ti Auckland Harbor** - The text mentions the bridge's age (48 years) but doesn’t say it caused a problem for timing his speed.



"
Sadinno ti nakaisentroan ti gingined a mainaig iti Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 milia iti abagatan**.

The passage states: ""Ti sentro ti ginggined ket adda iti agarup 65 km (40 milia) iti abagatan ti Butte."" (The center of the earthquake is approximately 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.)



"
Ania ti napasamak bayat ti riribuk idiay Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Panangabuso kadagiti balud (Abuse of prisoners)**.

The passage explicitly states that the scandal at Abu Ghraib came about *after* the discovery of prisoner abuse by US forces. This makes prisoner abuse the central event of the scandal.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maysa a lockdown (A lockdown)** - While a lockdown might have occurred *as a result* of the scandal, it wasn't the core event that triggered it.
*   **C: Nangtengngel dagiti puersa ti US (US forces intervened)** - The passage states the abuse was *by* US forces, not that they intervened to stop it initially.
*   **D: Napuoran ti pagbaludan (The prison was burned)** - The passage says the prison ""latak"" (collapsed/fell) *after* the scandal, not that it was burned during the uprising.



"
Apay a nakagun-od ti panagdindinnamag ti pagbaludan ti Iraq? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ti pannakatakuat iti panangabuso kadagiti balud** (The strengthening of abuse of the law).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the prison became infamous *after* abuses of prisoners were discovered.** This means the reason for its notoriety was directly related to the abuses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pinuoran daytoy** (It was raided) - While the prison was raided, the raid wasn't *why* it became infamous, it's how the abuses were discovered.
* **B: Kontrolado dagiti puersa ti US** (Controlled by US forces) -  Control by US forces is a fact, but doesn’t explain *why* it became infamous.
* **C: Nagadu ti riribuk** (The war increased) -  The war provided the context, but didn’t directly cause the infamy; it was the actions within the prison.



"
Ania a kita ti pasken ti maangay iti War Memorial Stadium ti Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Konsierto**.

Here's why:

The passage states the event was a ""banda"" (band) performance, and it was scheduled to accommodate 9,000 *people* (suggesting a large-scale entertainment event).  This clearly indicates it was a concert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magic show** - While a band *could* include magic, the description focuses on the band itself, not illusion.
*   **B: Ay-ayam ti football** - The passage doesn't mention football at all.
*   **D: Panagurnong iti pondo** -  This doesn't fit the context of a band and a large audience.



"
Asinno ti nangipaay kamaudiananna iti panangilawlawag maipapan iti pannakakansela ti pasamak?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti kompania a mangimatmaton (The managing company)**.

The passage states that HK Management Inc. (the managing company) initially didn't give a reason for the cancellation but *later* provided logistical difficulties as the reason.  Therefore, the managing company is the one who provided the explanation.



"
Asinno ti impagarup ti sumagmamano nga umili ti Bishkek a makaigapu iti pannakasamsam?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti agprotprotesta**.

The text states: ""Pinabasol ti sumagmamano a residente iti Bishnek dagiti nagprotesta a naggapu iti abagatan iti napasamak a riribuk."" (Some residents of Bishkek blame the protesters from the south for the recent turmoil.)

Therefore, some residents of Bishkek believe the protesters are responsible for the unrest/looting.



"
Asinno ti nangpabasol kadagiti agprotprotesta manipud iti abagatan gapu iti panagsamsam?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti umili ti Bishkek** (The residents of Bishkek).

The text states: ""Pinabasol ti sumagmamano a residente iti Bishnek dagiti nagprotesta a naggapu iti abagatan iti napasamak a riribuk."" This directly translates to ""Some residents of Bishkek blamed the protesters from the south for the recent chaos.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pannakabagi ti linteg** (Law enforcement) - The text doesn't mention law enforcement blaming the protesters.
* **C: Dagiti anarkista** (Anarchists) - While the text *describes* the situation as leaning towards ""anarchy,"" it doesn't say anarchists are doing the blaming.
* **D: Gang ti tattao** (Gangs) - The text mentions gangs *committing* the thefts, not blaming the protesters.



"
Kaano a napadasan ti Ring ti immadu a naglakuan?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalpasan ti panagparangna iti QVC**.

The passage states that Ring's exposure increased *after* Jamie Siminoff appeared on QVC in 2017. While Shark Tank was an earlier attempt, it was unsuccessful (the judges didn't invest). The ADT partnership came *after* increased exposure, not before.



"
Kaano nga inkeddeng ni Jamie Siminoff a rugian ti Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalpasan a nabigbigna a saan nga umdas ti bukodna a doorbell**.

The passage states that Jamie Siminoff *started the company because his doorbell didn't work in his garage*. This is the direct reason for starting Ring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While *Shark Tank* was a part of the story, it wasn't the initial impetus. He started *before* the show and it didn't result in funding at the time.
* **C:** He didn't have funding *to start* the company, it came later.
* **D:** QVC happened much later, after the company was already going.



"
Tunggal Reading Rainbow episode ket nangitukon kadagiti rekomendasion dagiti ubbing para iti ania?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti libro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kada pabuya ket mangted met iti rekomendasion no ania dagiti libro a masapul a biroken dagiti ubbing no mapanda iti libraria."" (Each episode also provided a recommendation of what books children should look for when they were at the library.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti pabuya iti telebision** - While *Reading Rainbow* was a TV show, the episodes focused on recommending *books*, not other shows.
*   **B: Dagiti lokal a libraria** - The show suggested books to find *in* libraries, but didn't focus on the libraries themselves.
*   **C: Dagiti tema** - While each episode *had* a theme based on a book, the ultimate goal was to recommend books related to that theme.



"
Ania ti mabalin a nakatulong iti pannakakansela ti serye ti Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti opinion ni John Grant**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Mamati ti dadduma, agraman ni John Grant, nga iti krisis ti panagpundo ken panagbaliw ti pilosopia ti panagprograma kadagiti pang-edukasion a telebision ket isu iti nakaigapuan ti panangisardengda kadagiti pabuya."" This directly links John Grant's belief (and the beliefs of others) about funding crises and changes in educational TV philosophy to the cancellation of shows like Reading Rainbow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Awan ti umdas a pondo** - While the passage mentions a funding *crisis*, it doesn't explicitly state that lack of funding was *the* reason for cancellation.
*   **B: Awan ti Emmy awards** - The passage specifically states Reading Rainbow won *over* two dozen Emmy awards, so this is false.
*   **D: Ti balligi ti Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood** - The passage mentions that Reading Rainbow's runtime was shorter than Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but it doesn't imply the latter's popularity caused Reading Rainbow to be canceled.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga argumento nga inaramid dagiti opisial para iti Amsterdam ken ti museo maipapan iti kayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Rumbeng a maitalimeng dayta**.

Here's why:

The passage states the officials argued the tree **could pose a risk to public health** (D) and was **infected with fungus** (C). It also implies a risk of branches falling, which relates to being **dangerous** (A - implied danger). 

However, the passage *does not* mention any argument about the tree being **likely to fall** (B). That's why it's the answer that wasn't used as justification.



"
"Segun iti maysa a chief inspector para iti RSPCA, dagiti inspeksion ket rumbeng a kadawyan para iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti abattoir** (Abattoirs).

Here's why:

The passage states that the RSPCA wants inspections to be *standardized* across Australia, specifically at **slaughterhouses (pagpartian)**.  David O'Shannessy, the chief inspector, believes CCTV cameras will deter mistreatment of animals in these facilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti CCTV kamera** - The passage is *about* CCTV cameras being used *for* inspections, not the inspections themselves being about the cameras.
*   **B: Siasinoman nga agtartrabaho kadagiti animal** - While important, the focus is on the facilities themselves.
*   **C: Dagiti instalasion ti panagsiput** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong a mangpatibker iti kinapateg ti pagimbagan ti kinakaradkad dagiti animal kadagiti trabahador iti abattoir nga Australiano?","The correct answer is **A: Ti pannakaikabil dagiti CCTV kamera** (The installation of CCTV cameras).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** David O'Shannessy believes CCTV cameras will ""act as a deterrent to people working in slaughterhouses that the welfare of animals is the top priority."" This directly links CCTV cameras to improving animal welfare by influencing worker behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti mandatorio a miting iti RSPCA** (Mandatory meetings with the RSPCA) - The text doesn't mention anything about mandatory meetings.
* **C: Regular a panagsukimat iti abattoir** (Regular inspections of abattoirs) - While inspections are mentioned as needing to be consistent across Australia, the *deterrent* effect is specifically attributed to the CCTV cameras.
* **D: Panangimaton manipud iti ABC** (Attention from the ABC) - The ABC is simply *reporting* on the issue, not directly contributing to improving animal welfare.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti trabaho ti tao a naaresto?","The correct answer is **A: Estudiante**.

The text states: ""...maysa nga estudyante pay ti naaresto mainaig ti panagpaltog idiay eskuela..."" which directly translates to ""...one student was arrested in connection with the shooting at the school...""



"
"Segun iti mabasa, bayat nga agsaksaknap ti damag maipapan iti sabali pay a pannakaaresto, maar-aramid dagiti pumpon para ti mano a biktima?","The correct answer is **B: Tallo**.

The text states: ""...dagiti tabun para ken Jeff Weise ken **tallo pay** kadagiti siam a biktima ket napasamak..."" 

This means that in addition to Jeff Weise and one other victim, funeral arrangements were made for three more victims. Therefore, a total of three funerals were prepared.



"
"Kas sungbat kadagiti protesta, ania a pagilian ti saan a nagturong iti pinirmaan ti katulaganda iti ACTA?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Idi naminsan a bulan, adu ti nangruna a protesta idiay Poland no kaano a ti pagilian ket nagpirma iti ACTA, a nangiturong iti gobierno ti Poland nga agdesision a saanda pay a pasingkedan dayta a katulagan, tatta."" This directly translates to ""Last month, there were major protests in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which led the Polish government to decide not to ratify that agreement yet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Germany:** The text says protests *happened* in Germany, but doesn't say they didn't sign ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland:** Protests occurred in Scotland, but it doesn't mention anything about their stance on ACTA.
*   **D: Lithuania:**  Protests happened in Lithuania, but no information is given about their decision regarding ACTA.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagilian ti nangikeddeng a mangitantan iti proseso ti pannakikadua iti ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""In Latvia and Slovakia the process of joining ACTA was similarly halted."" This means Latvia decided to stop the process of joining ACTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Estonia** - The text only mentions protests *in* Estonia, not that they halted the process.
* **B: Lithuania** - The text only mentions protests *in* Lithuania, not that they halted the process.
* **C: Scotland** - The text only mentions protests *in* Scotland, not that they halted the process.



"
Mano a tattao ti nasugatan gapu kadagiti insidente ti panagbara ti iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""...nangitunda iti innem nga uram ken **panagsagaba iti uppat a tao** iti pannakasinit."" (resulting in six hours and injury to four people in the burns).

Therefore, four people were injured due to the iPod blocking incidents."
Asinno ti nagkuna a saan unay a nakaro dagiti insidente ti panagpudot?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The passage states: ""inwaragawag ti METI a pinakaammuan ida ti Apple iti 34 a nainayon nga insidente ti nalabes a panagbara, nga imbilang ti kompania a “saan a serioso.""""  This directly translates to ""METI stated that Apple acknowledged 34 related incidents of overheating, which the company considered “not serious.”""

Therefore, Apple is the one who said the incidents weren't very serious.



"
"Bayat ti panagbitlana, ania ti imbaga ni Steve Jobs nga imbento manen ti Apple?","The correct answer is **B: Ti phone**.

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""Ita ti Apple ket mangbaliw iti telepono..."" which translates to ""Apple is going to change the phone..."" He was introducing a new iPhone and claiming it would revolutionize the phone industry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pakasaritaan (History)** - While he said they would make a historical event, he wasn't *inventing* history.
*   **C: Ti kompania (The company)** - He wasn't reinventing Apple itself.
*   **D: Teknolohiya (Technology)** - He was applying technology to *the phone*, not inventing technology in general.



"
Ania ti panggep ti dua nga oras a palawag ni Steve Jobs?,"The correct answer is **C: Tapno mairuar ti baro a phone**.

The passage explicitly states Steve Jobs was presenting and then revealed the iPhone from his pocket, saying they were ""going to change the phone."" This clearly indicates the purpose of his two-hour presentation was to launch a new phone.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tapno mairugi ti baro a tablet:** The passage focuses on a phone, not a tablet.
*   **B: Tapno mairugi ti baro a kompiuter:**  The passage focuses on a phone, not a computer.
*   **D: Tapno ipakaammona ti panagretirona:** The passage doesn't mention anything about retirement."
Ania ti inwaragawag ni Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner iti Teatro ti Argentina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti kandidaturana kas presidente**.

The passage states: ""Impakaammo ni Mrs. Kircher ti intensionna a tumaray para ti pagkapresidente idiay Argentene Theathre..."" (Mrs. Kircher announced her intention to run for president at the Argentina Theatre...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panggepna ti agkandidato iti Senado** - While she started a campaign there for Senate in 2005, the passage focuses on her *current* announcement.
* **C: Ti kampaniana para iti delegasion ti probinsia ti Buenos Aires** - This happened in 2005, not the recent announcement.
* **D: Ti planona nga agikkat kas agdama a senador** - The passage doesn't mention anything about her stepping down as senator.



"
Sadinno ti nangipakaammoan ni Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner iti panggepna nga agkandidato?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti teatro ti Buenos Aires idiay La Plata**.

Here's why:

* The passage states she announced her intention ""idiay Argentene Theathre, iti pareho nga lokasion nga inusarna idi rugianna iti kampanyana idi 2005..."" and that La Plata is 50 kilometers from Buenos Aires. This means the theater is in La Plata, which is near Buenos Aires.
* The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the location (mixing up Buenos Aires and La Plata) or the distance."
Ania dagiti natakuatan ti ACMA maipapan ken ni Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Saan pay a nasukir dagiti linteg ti panangsensor**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement directly says:** ""uray no maipabpabuya ti video iti internet, saan a linabsing ti Big Brother dagiti linteg iti online content censorhip"" (even if a video is published on the internet, Big Brother does not bypass the laws of online content censorship). This means the laws haven't been circumvented/violated - they haven't been *broken*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Natakuatan a naidulin ti media iti website ti Big Brother:** The passage states the media is *not* placed on Big Brother's website, so this is incorrect.
* **C: Nalabsing dagiti linteg ti panangsensor:** This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: Natakuatan a pisikal nga agnanaed ti linaon iti maysa a server:** While the passage mentions needing a server, the core concern of ACMA isn't *where* the content is stored, but whether censorship laws are being followed.



"
Ania dagiti parametro a masapul a mairaman ti media tapno maibilang a linaon ti internet?,"The correct answer is **A: Masapul a mai-stream dayta iti internet**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Naammuan pay ti ACMA nga uray no maipabpabuya ti video iti internet..."" This directly implies that simply *being published online* (streamed to the internet) is the key factor.
* **The passage also explains:** The Online Safety Act regulates online content, even though it needs to pass through a server. This means the *act of being online* triggers regulation, not necessarily where it's physically stored.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masapul a pisikal nga agnanaed dayta iti server:**  The passage states the content passes *through* a server, but doesn't require permanent residence there.
* **C: Saan a maidulin dayta iti website:** The passage specifically discusses videos *being published* online, implying they *are* accessible.
* **D: Masapul nga aprobaran ti ACMA:** The passage doesn’t mention the need for ACMA approval to be considered online content, only that ACMA is *aware* of content published online.



"
Asinno ti lider ti Liberal a Partido ti Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The passage states that Peter Costello ""nalabit a sumukat ken Prime Minister John Howard kas lider ti grupo Liberal"" (challenged and measured up to Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal group). This clearly identifies John Howard as the leader of the Liberal Party.



"
Apay a saan pay nga addaan ti Australia iti industria ti nuclear a bileg?,"The most logical answer based on the provided text is **B: Kontrobersial unay (Too controversial)**.

Here's why:

* **The text focuses on Peter Costello *overcoming* opposition to nuclear power.** He states Australia should adopt it ""if it becomes commercial,"" and explicitly says there's no *principled* objection. This implies there *is* an objection, and that objection is likely related to public and/or political controversy.
* While the other options might be factors, they aren't directly indicated in the passage:
    * **A: Awan ti suporta ti publiko (Lack of public support)** - Costello's statement suggests that overcoming public opinion is part of the equation, not the sole reason.
    * **C: Napeggad unay (Too expensive)** - The text mentions commercial viability, but doesn't say it's currently too expensive.
    * **D: Nangina unay (Too slow)** - Speed of development isn't mentioned.



Therefore, **B** is the best answer because it addresses the implied hurdle to nuclear power in Australia – the controversy surrounding it."
Asinno nga agis-ski ti nakisali babaen ti tulong ti maysa a giya?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

The text states: ""Ti umi-ski a lalaki ti Poland nga addaan problema ti panagkitana a ni Maciej Krezel **ken ti giyana a ni Anna Ogarzynka** ket nakalpasda kas maikasangapulo-ket-tallo iti Super-G.""  This means Anna Ogarzynska skied *with* a guide (because she is a guide).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - The text just states her placing, not that she used a guide.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - The text states he skied in the seated category, not with a guide.
*   **C: Maciej Krezel** - The text states *he* has vision impairment and is likely the one being guided, not the guide himself.



"
Ania a pagilian ti nagturpos a maikasangapulo iti standing class ti babbai iti Super-G?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The text states: ""Karaman ti Netherlands, nga inrepresentar ni Anna Jochemsen a nakaala iti maika-siam a puesto iti standing class ti babbai iti Super-G idi kalman...""  This translates to ""Notably, the Netherlands, represented by Anna Jochemsen, finished in ninth place in the women's standing class in Super-G yesterday.""

While the question asks for 10th place, the passage states Anna Jochemsen of the Netherlands finished **ninth**, not tenth. However, it's the Netherlands that is specifically mentioned as the country for the standing class female Super-G.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng maipapan ken ni Blake ti saan a nakanatad?","The correct answer is **B: Inaminna ti panangraut** (He admitted to the assault).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ket ilibakna ti atake"" which translates to ""he pleaded guilty to the assault"". This directly indicates he admitted to the assault.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Natiliw daytoy iti lugar** (He stumbled in the place) - The text doesn't mention him stumbling.
* **C: Nagusar iti poste bayat ti panangraut** (He used a pole during the assault) - The text says he *used* the pole, but doesn't state it was *during* the assault, it was to defend himself.
* **D: Kinunana a naibelleng kenkuana dagiti botelia** (He stated bottles were thrown at him) - The text states bottles *were* thrown at him, but doesn't mention him *stating* that.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a napasamak ken ni Blake?","The correct answer is **C: Naraut babaen ti poste**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Blake *used* the pole to defend himself, not that he was injured by it.** He used it against the bottles thrown at him.
* **A: Naduktalan a nakabasol gapu iti panangballikug iti hustisia** - The passage specifically says he pleaded guilty to obstructing justice (""nakedngan pay ni Blake iti panangpadasna a padaksen ti panagray ti hustisia"").
* **B: Natiliw isuna** - The passage doesn't mention anything about him tripping or falling.
* **D: Naibaga kenkuana a dakkel ti gasat a maibalud isuna** - The passage states the judge told him imprisonment was ""mabalin a saannan a maliklikan"" (likely unavoidable).

Therefore, the only thing that *didn't* happen to Blake according to the text is being injured by the pole.



"
Ania ti saan a pakausaran ti pondo ti U.N. iti panagbara ti lubong?,"The correct answer is **B: Panangiyeg iti teknolohia kadagiti agdurdur-as a nasion**.

Here's why:

The passage states the U.N. hopes funds will be used for things like better housing, water management, and increasing plant life. It *also* mentions using technology to help developing nations lessen their carbon footprint.  However, it doesn't say the funds will be *used to buy* the technology itself, but to *help* nations implement it.  The focus is on assisting them, not directly purchasing the tech.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pannakapayad-adu ti mulmula (Increasing plant life):** The passage explicitly states funds *can* be used for this.
*   **C: Di malayus a balbalay (Better housing):** The passage explicitly states funds *can* be used for this.
*   **D: Panangpalag-an kadagiti epekto ti panagbara ti lubong (Mitigating the effects of climate change):** The passage states the funds are *to help countries cope* with climate change's effects, so this is a direct use of the funds.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti namnamaen nga isalakan ti U.N.?","The correct answer is **A: Kuarta, babaen ti panagbibinninglay iti teknolohia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Namnamaen met ti U. N. a mairingpas ti pondo a mangtulong kadagiti pagilian a naapektaran ti panagbara ti lubong tapno mabaeladan a sarangten dagiti epekto...""  This directly translates to ""The U.N. hopes to raise funds to help countries affected by climate change so they can mitigate the effects..."" It also mentions using technology to help developing nations in low-emission ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti apit (Fires)** - The passage doesn't mention fires as something the U.N. hopes to solve.
* **C: Nabati a kabakiran (Remaining forests)** - While the passage *mentions* protecting forests, it doesn't say the U.N. *hopes to solve* that issue directly. It's a problem the broader discussion addresses, but not the U.N.'s immediate hope.
* **D: Dagiti tattao a naapektaran iti nakapuy a pannakamanehar ti danum (People affected by poor water management)** -  The passage mentions better water management *as a result* of the funding, but not as the thing the U.N. hopes to solve in itself.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a dinakamat ni Albert Muchanga kas banag a kasapulan pay laeng a mapagnunumuan?,"The correct answer is **A: No makikadua koma ni Benin iti AfCTA**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Albert Muchanga was *informed* that Benin would join. This means it was already a known fact, not something he needed clarification on.
*   The passage explicitly states that Nigeria is *still working on* the rules of origin and tariffs (options C and D).
*   Nigeria mentions their model is ""ready"" for trade to commence on July 1, 2020 (option B), but they still need to finalize the rules for it to happen.

Therefore, the only thing Albert Muchanga *didn't* need to be informed about was Benin's participation, as he was already told."
"Segun iti mabasa, apay a mabalin a mangrugi ti panagtagilako iti Hulio?","The correct answer is **B: Adda umdas a balangkas dagiti alagaden ken konsesion a naikabil.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ngem ti modelo nga addaan kami ket umanay tapno marugian ti panagkalakal intono Hulyo 1, 2020"".  This translates to ""but the model we have is ready so that trade can begin on July 1, 2020."" This clearly indicates a framework of rules and concessions is in place to *allow* trade to start on that date.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions Nigeria's terms, it doesn't say the July start date *is* their term, only that their model will be ready *by* that date.
* **C:** The commissioner's opinion isn't the reason trade might start in July.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states they *haven't finalized* the rules regarding origin and tariffs.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti inakusaran ti Atlanta Journal-Constitution kadagiti opisial ti edukasion?","The correct answer is **C: Saan nga agtignay kadagiti naduktalan a parikut iti uneg.**

Here's why:

The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report ""showed problems with test results"" and that schools ""knew they had problems but didn't take action on what they knew."" This directly supports the accusation of failing to address known issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panangbalbaliw iti report ti Journal-Constitution** - The passage doesn't state the Journal-Constitution was accused of altering its report.
*   **B: Ti pannakapaay a mangpabaro iti edukasion iti siudad** - While Hall was praised for improving education, the accusation wasn't about *trying* to improve it, but about *how* the improvements were achieved.
*   **D: Panangireport kadagiti nababa nga iskor iti eksamen** - The Journal-Constitution *reported* on the problematic scores, they weren't accused of reporting them.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti saan a nadakamat iti report ti Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **C: Iti 2013 a nangabak iti Nasional a Superintendent iti Tawen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Hall received the National Superintendent of the Year award in 2009, *not* 2013.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naisangsangayan a panagpasayaat ti marka ti eksamen** - The passage clearly states schools in Atlanta saw ""dakkel a pagsayaatan kadagiti puntosda iti panagsubok"" (a great improvement in test scores).
* **B: Ebidensia a nabalbaliwan dagiti papel ti eksamen** - The passage states ""Naipakita kalpasanna ti ebidensia a nabiangan dagiti test paper"" (evidence was shown that test papers were altered).
* **D: Singasing para iti panagbalbaliw ti edukasion iti siudad** - The passage states Hall was ""nailasin isuna para iti pagrang-ayan iti edukasion diay siudad"" (recognized for her advocacy for education in the city).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga impormasion ti naammuan kalpasan ti pannakabomba?","The correct answer is **D: Ti opisial a bilang ti natay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sumagmamano a padamag ti nangibaga nga iti opisial a bilang ti natay ket walo..."" (Several reports stated that the official death toll was eight...)

While the passage *also* mentions injuries and future bombings, the question asks what information is *learned* after the bombing. The official death toll is a direct result and information gained *from* the bombing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti maudi a bilang ti pannakadangran (The final injury count):** The passage says the final number of injured is *unknown* (""ngem ti maudi a bilang ket saan pay naamuan""). It doesn't provide that information.
* **B: Ania dagiti pasdek nga asideg ti pinagsabugan dagiti bomba (Which buildings were near the bombs):** The passage mentions buildings near the government, but doesn't specify *which* ones.
* **C: No mapabettak dagiti kanayonan a bomba (When the other bombs will detonate):** The passage states they *will* detonate within two hours, but doesn't give the exact time. It's a warning, not information learned *after* the first bombing.



"
"Manipud idi nakikadua iti Manchester City idi 2017, mano a laban ti nagay-ayaman ni Jesus?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text explicitly states: ""Manipud idin, naiparang ti Brazilian iti **53 a laban** para iti club iti amin a kompetision..."" which translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian has appeared in **53 matches** for the club in all competitions...""



"
Ania a club ti nakaawat ni Jesus iti £27 milion a bayad gapu iti pannakikaduana?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states that Jesus transferred *from* Palmeiras to Manchester City. The £27 million was the fee *Palmeiras* received for letting him join Manchester City.

Ania a keddeng maipapan kadagiti sangaili iti hostel ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaaduan kadagiti sangaili ket naggapu iti nasantuan a siudad**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that most of the visitors at the hostel are from the United Arab Emirates, *not* Mecca (the holy city).  The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A:** The hostel is in Mecca, for pilgrims.
*   **B:** The passage mentions visitors from the United Arab Emirates, implying non-local origin.
*   **C:** The incident happened *during* the Hajj pilgrimage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti pudno?","The correct answer is **C: Adda sadiay dagiti sangaili para iti bisperas ti hajj pilgrimage.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Imbalay diay istruktura iti mano a bilang n peregrino a napan bummisita iti nasantuan a siudad idi rabii ti panagperegrino iti hajj."" (A hostel in Mecca collapsed with a large number of pilgrims who had visited the holy city on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage). This directly indicates there were pilgrims present before the Hajj.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awan ti natay (There are no deaths):** The passage explicitly states ""Ti bilang dagiti natay ket saan a bumaba iti 15..."" (The number of deaths is not less than 15...).
* **B: Amin dagiti sangaili ket naggapu idiay United Arab Emirates (All the victims are from the United Arab Emirates):** The passage says *most* of the visitors are from the UAE, not all.
* **D: Kaaduan kadagiti sangaili ket dagiti lumugar ti Mecca (Most of the victims are residents of Mecca):** The passage states the visitors are from the UAE, not that they're residents of Mecca.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga impormasion maipapan iti panagdinnungpar ti saan a di masigurado?","The correct answer is **A: Ti kadakkel ti panagdinnungpar** (The size of the impact).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Padpadasenda pay la nga ammuen no kasano kadakkel ti pannakadungpar..."" (They are still trying to find out how big the impact is...). This directly indicates that the size of the impact is *uncertain*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti lokasion ti panagdinnungpar** (The location of the impact) - While not *explicitly* stated, the passage implies it's being tracked by the US Strategic Command, meaning they have some knowledge of the location.
*   **C: Ti epekto ti panagdinnungpar iti Daga** (The effect of the impact on Earth) -  The scientists are trying to determine this, but the passage *states* they are investigating this effect, so it’s acknowledged as something they're looking into, not that it's unknown.
*   **D: Ti lokasion dagiti debris** (The location of the debris) - The passage specifically says the US Strategic Command is tracking the debris, so its location *is* being monitored.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania pay ti masapul a maikeddeng maipapan iti panagdinnungpar?","The correct answer is **D: Ti eksakto a rukod ti pannakadungpar**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists are trying to determine ""kasano kadakkel ti pannakadungpar"" (how big the impact is) and ""no kasano a maapektaran ti Daga"" (how the Earth will be affected). This directly relates to needing to know the *exact extent* of the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asinno ti mangasikaso iti panagsurot iti debris** - The passage *already* answers this: ""Sursuroten ti opisina ti United States Strategic Command ti U.S. Department of Defense ti debris."" (The office of the United States Strategic Command of the U.S. Department of Defense tracks the debris).
*   **B: Kapartak ti panagdaliasat dagiti satellite idi tiempo ti panagdinnungparda** - The passage mentions the speed of the satellites (17,500 mph) but doesn't ask about the *timing* of their speed relative to the impact.
*   **C: No kasano a maibinglay dagiti resulta ti plotting analysis** - The passage states the results will be ""maipaskilto maysa a publiko a website"" (published on a public website), but doesn't ask *how* they will be presented.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania a rangko ti dati nga iggem ni Batten iti listaan ti Kabaknangan nga Amerikano?","The correct answer is **C: Maika-190**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ni Batten ket nairangko ti **maika-190** ti listaan ti 400 a Kabaknangan a Amerikano idi 2008..."" 

The other options are incorrect as they do not match the information provided in the text."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nagdonaran ni Batten?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti Unibersidad ti Virginia**.

The passage specifically states: ""Nagsa a nangruna nga agindondonar iti dayta nga institusion"" (He was a leading donor to that institution), and identifies the institution as the University of Virginia. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti listaan ti Kabaknangan a Amerikano** - He was *on* the list, but didn't donate *to* it.
*   **C: Maysa a naisangsangayan a bilang dagiti institusion** - The text only mentions one institution.
*   **D: Kolehio a naidedikar iti arte ken siensia** - While he graduated from the College of Arts & Sciences, the question asks where he *donated* to, not where he studied.



"
Ania ti saan a paset ti linteg a pinirmaan ni Gobernador Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Maiparit ti panaglako wenno panagabang kadagiti naranggas a video game kadagiti menor de edad iti ruar ti California.**

Here's why:

The passage states the law *applies within the state of California*. It doesn't restrict sales or rentals *outside* of California. Options A, B, and D all describe elements *within* the law as described in the passage.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage directly states the law restricts sales/rentals *within* California.
*   **B:** The passage states there is a $1000 fine for violations.
*   **D:** The passage mentions a decal requirement for violent games.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti saan a nakangngeg kadagiti banag a maibagbaga?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...agsagsaganaak idi isu a saanko unay a nangngegan ti  imbagbagana.” which translates to ""...he was rambling so I didn't really hear what he was saying."" The ""he"" refers to Mike Duvall, and ""I"" refers to Miller. Therefore, Miller is the one who didn't hear much of what was being said.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti pudno iti kapadasan ni Miller iti bista ti kaso?","The correct answer is **B: Saan nga agim-imdeng bayat ti panagsaganana.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Adu la unay ti sawsawen ni Mike bayat ti bista… agsagsaganaak idi isu a saanko unay a nangngegan ti imbagbagana.” This translates to ""Mike had a lot to say during the visit... I was preoccupied so I didn't really listen to what he said.""  This clearly indicates Miller wasn't fully attentive while Duvall (Mike) was speaking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adda impresion ni Duvall ken ni Miller bayat ti bista ti kaso** (Duvall and Miller had an impression during the visit). The passage only states Duvall *made* an impression, not that Miller *had* one.
* **C: Adu ti nagsaritaan ti dua nga annak ni Duvall bayat ti bista ti kaso** (Duvall's two children spoke a lot during the visit). The passage only mentions Duvall speaking (""Mike"").
* **D: Sipapasnek ti panangasikasona iti istoria ni Duvall** (Miller interfered with Duvall's story). The passage shows Miller *didn't* listen, not that they interfered.



"
Asinno ti nangisingasing a maaramid dagiti rebision iti ‘Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti Konserbatibo a partido**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""dumawdawat iti “maminpinsan ken kompleto a pannakabaliw ti pannakaisurat” ti gakat para iti aglawlaw ti partido a Konserbatibo."" This means the Conservative party requested and received revisions to the bill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Howard:** While John Howard is mentioned, he is explaining *why* the funding is being provided, not requesting changes to the act.
*   **C: Jack Layton:** Jack Layton pressured for changes but did not *make* the revisions. He accepted them.
*   **D: Stephen Harper:** Stephen Harper agreed to the review by the committee, but the text specifically states the Conservative party requested revisions.



"
Asinno ti nangsuppiat a ti “Clean Air Act” ket maus-usar a pre-election stunt?,"The correct answer is **D: Maysa a pederal nga MP**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngem imbaga ti Prime Minister a ni Joh Howard a ti linteg ket para laeng masalakniban dagiti pasilidad ti ospital kontra iti pannakaibaba ti gradoda ti Gobierno ti Tasmania, ket nangted ti nayun a AUD$45 milion."" This indicates that some federal MPs believed the act was a ploy to start a federal election in November, making them the ones suspecting it was a pre-election stunt. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti opisial ti gobierno ti estado** - The text doesn't mention a state government official suspecting a stunt.
*   **B: Maysa a Primero Ministro** - The Prime Minister (Joh Howard) *denies* it's a stunt, he's defending the act.
*   **C: Maysa a lider ti NDP** - While Jack Layton was involved in discussions about the Clean Air Act, the text doesn't state he believed it was a stunt; it focuses on changes to the bill's wording.



"
Ania ti nabukel dagiti compound a cyanuric acid ken melamine idi nagreaksionda iti maysa ken maysa iti isbo ti pusa?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti crystal**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Napaliiw dagiti managsirarak a mabuo dagiti kristal ti isbo iti pusa no manayunan iti melamine ken asido a cyanuric."" (Researchers found that crystals formed in the cat's kidneys when melamine and cyanuric acid were combined.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti bekkel** - The passage doesn't mention ""bekkel"" (eggs).
*   **B: Makan ti taraken** - The passage states the cats *ate* contaminated food, but the reaction *created* something else.
*   **D: Infrared spectroscopy** - This is a *method used to identify* the crystals, not what the compounds created.



"
Ania ti inusar dagiti managsirarak nga infrared spectroscopy tapno mapaliiwda?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti nangbukel kadagitoy a kristal iti isbo ti taraken**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti nangbukel kadagitoy a kristal ket maituto kadagiti mabirukan idiay isbo ti apektado a taraken no iyasping bayat iti infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""  This directly translates to ""What the crystals are made of could be identified in the kidney of affected cats when examined using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagobra ti bekkel** - The passage doesn't mention kidney function specifically, just that the crystals *affect* kidney function.
*   **C: Naapektaran a taraken** - FTIR was used to analyze *what was in* the affected cats' kidneys, not the cats themselves.
*   **D: Kontaminado a makan ti taraken** - FTIR was used on kidney samples, not the contaminated food.



"
Asinno ti nangtukoy ken ni Luna kas “Reyna ti Extreme”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states: ""Kuna ni Tommy Dreamer “ni Luna ti immuna a Reyna ti Extreme."" (Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme."")

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who referred to Luna as ""Queen of Extreme.""



"
Asinno ti nangiladawan ken ni Luna kas “saan a kadawyan”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Imbaga ni Dustin “Goldust” Runnels a “Ni Luna ket komidiante a kasla met laeng kaniak… baka nakarkaro pay… ay-ayatek isuna ken mailiwak kaniana… sapay koma ta adda isunan iti nasaysayaat a lugar.”""  This translates to Dustin Runnels saying Luna was ""a little crazy"" (""baka nakarkaro pay"").  ""Nakarkaro"" implies someone is not ordinary or typical -  ""saan a kadawyan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti fans-na (Her fans):** The text doesn't mention what fans thought of her being ""saan a kadawyan"".
* **C: Dagiti imbestigador ti gobierno (Government investigators):** They were focused on recorders, not Luna's personality.
* **D: Tommy Dreamer:** He described her as strong and a pioneer, not ""saan a kadawyan"".



"
Ania ti saan a napasamak iti agmanmaneho a nairaman iti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **C: Naiyakar isuna manipud iti ospital idiay Cambridge agingga iti maysa idiay Great Yarmouth**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Immuna a naospital isuna iti James Paget Hospital idiay Great Yarmouth. Idi kuan, nayakar isuna iti Addenbrooke's Hospital idiay Cambridge."" This means he was *transferred* from Great Yarmouth to Cambridge, not the other way around.  Option C reverses the order.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nagsagaba iti pannakadunor iti ulona** - The text explicitly states he *did* suffer a serious head injury.
* **B: Saanna a nadangran ti siasinoman kadagiti tattao iti uneg ti pagtaengan** - The text confirms no one inside the house was hurt. This is a true statement, but the question asks what *didn't* happen.
* **D: Timmulong dagiti serbisio ti emerhensia a nangikkat kenkuana iti luganna** - The text mentions emergency services attended to the driver, implying they helped him.



"
Ania ti saan a naisangsangayan iti gameplay ti South Africa bayat ti torneo ti rugby?,"The correct answer is **B: Kabaelan ti panangiggem iti bola**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kasla kurang ti praktisda bayat a makilablabanda kadagiti kakabsatda a babbai iti abagatan..."" This translates to ""It seemed they lacked practice while playing with their female siblings in the south..."" This implies their ball-handling skills (or ""panangiggem iti bola"") weren't fully honed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makaay-ayo a panagkaykaysa ti garaw** - The text specifically says ""namayat a panagkaykaysa ti garaw ti teamda"" (their team showed good teamwork).
*   **C: Nalaing nga ay-ayam iti rugi ti torneo** - The text states they won 26-00, indicating a strong start.
*   **D: Paglaingan iti depensa** - The text mentions ""nadisplina a depensada"" (disciplined defense).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a nangrugi a simmayaat ti ay-ayam ti South Africa?","The correct answer is **D: Bayat ti panagtultuloy ti torneo**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""simmayaat met lang ti naaramidan ti South Africa bayat a nagtultuloy ti ay-ayam."" This directly translates to ""South Africa did well as the game continued.""  It doesn't say they started well at 10:00 AM (that was just when the day began), nor does their good performance depend on their defense or beating Zambia. It happened *during* the continuation of the games.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiyanninaw iti ekonomia ti Tsina?","Ti correct answer ket **D: Saan pay a pulos nga ad-adu ti nailako ti Tsina a kotse ngem ti Germany.**

*   **B:**  Mabalin nga ad-adu a merkado ti Tsina iti panageksport ti kotse ngem ti Estados Unidos.
*   **C:**  Mabalin a dakdakkel ti GDP ti Tsina inton agangay ngem ti Estados Unidos.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a mabalin a lab-awan ti GDP ti Tsina ti Estados Unidos?","The correct answer is **B: Iti las-ud ti dua a dekada**.

The passage states: ""Ti GDP ti Tsina ket mabalin dakdakketonl ngem iti Estados Unidos iti uneg ti dua a dekada."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kalpasan ti ad-adu pay a reporma iti ekonomia** - While more reforms might *help*, the passage specifically mentions a timeframe, not further reforms.
*   **C: No adda iti sidong ti baro a liderato ti pagilian** - The passage doesn't mention leadership changes as a factor.
*   **D: Iti las-ud ti tallo a dekada** - The passage specifically states *two* decades, not three.



"
Ania ti insingasing ni Hu nga aramiden dagiti napanglaw a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **A: Alaen dagiti obligasion a mangiduron iti tukad ti panagdur-asda.**

Here's why:

* **Hu's statement:** He argues against developed countries being asked to take on obligations *beyond* their capacity and responsibility. He suggests they should lead by example (""lisian ti daan nga aramid"") but not be held to a higher standard than they can manage.
* **Option A aligns with this:**  ""Alaen dagiti obligasion a mangiduron iti tukad ti panagdur-asda"" translates to ""Take obligations that are appropriate for their level of development."" This directly reflects Hu's point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ipamaysam ti ekonomiko nga output:**  While he mentions economic growth, his point isn't about maximizing output, but about the fairness of emissions reduction requests *in relation* to that output.
* **C: Lumabes kadagiti agdama a responsibilidad:** He explicitly argues *against* developed countries being asked to exceed their current capabilities.
* **D: Panangliklik kadagiti daan a dalan ti polusion:** He wants them to *lead* the way to change, not continue down polluting paths.



"
Ania ti saan a nadakamat ni Hu?,"The correct answer is **D: Maysa a bilang para iti pannakakissay dagiti emission ti carbon.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saanna nga inkeddeng no kasano ti kaadu ti makissay, ibagbagana laeng nga agpannuray iti mapataud ti ekonomia ti China."" This directly translates to ""He did not specify how much emissions would be reduced, only stating it would be based on China's economic output.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti nakaibatayan dagiti pannakaputed (The basis of the reductions):** Hu *did* state the basis – economic output.
*   **B: Balakad kadagiti napanglaw a pagilian maipapan iti polusion (Plans for developing countries regarding pollution):** He expressed an opinion about developed countries going first.
*   **C: Petsa a manamnama a makissayan dagiti emission ti carbon (Date when emissions are expected to be reduced):** While not explicitly stated, the passage implies a reduction relative to 2020 levels based on growth since 2005, suggesting a timeline.



"
Para iti ania kadagiti sumaganad ti imbaga ni Veerman a saan a nasayaat ti kasasaad?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “Agturturong ti Angola iti kakaruan a panagraira ti kolera ket agtultuloy a **dakes ti kasasaad ti Angola**,” (Angola is leading in the highest number of cholera cases and the **situation in Angola** continues to be dire). 

Veerman specifically says the *situation in Angola* is bad. The other options are organizations involved, not the place whose situation is being described.



"
"Gapu iti prosecution, asinno ti mangala iti posision ni Huhne’s Cabinet?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ni Huhne ket suktan isuna iti Gabinete ni Ed Davey MP. Ni Norman Lamb MP ti manamnama a mangala iti trabaho ti Ministro ti Negosio a mapanawan ni Davey.""

This translates to: ""Huhne will be replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the Business Secretary job vacated by Davey.""

Therefore, Norman Lamb is taking the position.



"
Asinno ti mangala iti trabaho ti Ministro ti Negosio kalpasan ti pannakaidarum?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Ni Norman Lamb MP ti manamnama a mangala iti trabaho ti Ministro ti Negosio a mapanawan ni Davey."" This directly answers the question.



"
Ania ti paregtaen dagiti agpabuya nga aramiden dagiti agbuybuya bayat ti opera ni Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Makiraman iti panagusar iti cannabis**.

The passage explicitly states that during the opera, the audience was invited to partake in cannabis cigarettes on stage. This directly relates to the performance's theme of an artist whose life was dictated by ""love of drugs and Japan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agbiahe idiay Japan** - While Japan is mentioned as a fascination of the artist, the audience isn't invited to travel there.
* **C: Makikadua kadakuada iti entablado para iti pabuya** - The audience is invited to *participate* in something (using cannabis), not to perform *with* the performers.
* **D: Bay-am a maidiktar ti biagda iti ay-ayatenda** - This reflects the artist's story, not what the audience is expected to do.



"
Asinno ti kangrunaan nga agsigsigarilio kadagiti kasukat bayat ti opera?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti artista**.

The passage states the story is about an artist ""whose life was dictated by his love of drugs and Japan"" and that performers used cannabis cigarettes on stage. This directly implies the *artist* character was the one smoking.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti Pranses a agbuybuya (The French spectator)** - While the spectators were invited to join, the passage focuses on the *performance* and the artist's lifestyle being depicted.
* **C: Ti agpabuya (The performer)** - This is too general. The passage specifies the artist character.
* **D: Camille Saint-Saens** - He was the composer, not a character *in* the opera.



"
Ania ti sabali pay a nagan ti “spacewalk” nga inaramid ni Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: Extravehicular nga aktibidad**.

The passage explicitly states that ""spacewalk"" is also known as ""extravehicular activity (EVA)"". 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mision nga Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a later mission Leonov led, not another name for the spacewalk itself.
* **B: Panagsasalisal iti Law-ang:** This is a general term for space exploration, not the specific activity of a spacewalk.
* **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is Leonov's designation, not a name for the spacewalk.



"
Indauluan ni Leonov ti Soviet a paset ti ania a mision?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sangapulo a tawen ti naglabas, indauluanna ti parte ti Soviet iti mision nga Apollo-Soyuz..."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagsasalisal iti Law-ang (Space Race)** - While the Apollo-Soyuz mission *symbolized the end* of the Space Race, Leonov didn't lead the overall race, but specifically the Soviet part of that one mission.
*   **C: Cosmonaut No. 11** - This is a designation, not a mission.
*   **D: EVA** - He *performed* the first EVA, but didn't lead a mission *about* it.



"
Asinno ti nadangran iti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Kalpasan a mapasamak ti aksidente, naipan ni Gibson iti maysa nga ospital ngem saan a nagbayag ket natay met laeng."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to a hospital but died shortly after). This directly indicates Gibson was the one injured in the collision.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maysa a trabahador iti garahe** - The text states the worker *witnessed* the accident, they weren't injured.
*   **C: Ubbing** - The text mentions a child (""ubbubbig"") *crossing the road*, but doesn't say they were hit or injured.
*   **D: Ti nangiturong ti trak** - The text explicitly states the truck driver was *not* injured (""saan a nadangran"")."
Ania ti napasamak kadagiti tattao a nairaman iti aksidente?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa ti saan a nadangran, maysa ti natay.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after. The truck driver (age 64) was not injured in the collision. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Natay isuda a dua** - This isn't accurate as only Gibson died.
* **C: Agpukpukkaw ken agsangsangitda** - This describes the witnesses *after* the accident, not the people *in* the accident.
* **D: Agpada a nasugatan** - This is incorrect because the truck driver wasn't injured.



"
Mangnamnama dagiti sientista nga agtartrabaho iti programa a mapaliiwda dagiti epekto a patauden ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **C: Battit a banbanag**.

Here's why:

The passage states the program is designed to *model* observations of the Sagittarius galaxy, and the effect being studied is caused by the gravitational forces between the dark matter of both galaxies. The analogy to the moon and Earth's tides points to subtle, repeating *disturbances* or *ripples* caused by gravitational interaction.  ""Battit a banbanag"" (subtle effects) best captures this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kanayon a banag (constant things):** The effects are *caused* by interaction, not constant on their own.
*   **B: Dagiti puersa ti panagayus ti danum (forces of water movement):** While the tide analogy is used, the scientists aren't directly studying water movement.
*   **D: Nalimed a banag (large things):** The effects are subtle interactions of dark matter, not large-scale phenomena themselves.



"
Napaliiw idi dagiti sientista ti banag ti ania kadagiti sumaganad?,"The correct answer is **D: Iti Sagittarius galaxy ken iti Milky Way**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the interaction between the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way.** It explicitly states the program simulates observations of the Sagittarius galaxy and discusses how the Milky Way ""tides"" on it, similar to how the Moon tides on Earth.
* **The passage uses the Earth-Moon relationship as an *analogy* to explain the gravitational forces between the two galaxies.** It's not saying scientists were surprised by the Earth and Moon, but rather using that familiar interaction to explain a more complex one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti Milky Way ken iti Bulan:** While the Milky Way is central to the discussion, the Moon is only used as an analogy.
* **B: Iti Lubong ken iti Sagittarius galaxy:**  The Earth (""Lubong"") is only part of the analogy, not the primary focus of the scientists' observation.
* **C: Iti Lubong ken iti Bulan:**  Again, the Earth and Moon are just used for comparison.



"
"Segun iti paset, ania ti saan a dildillawen dagiti konserbatibo?","The correct answer is **C: Siasino ti maipapaayan iti kontrata iti rekonstruksion** (Who benefited from the reconstruction contracts).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...the criticism during the bidding process focused on the awarding of contracts to Washington insiders."" 
* This means the conservatives were *not* concerned with just *how much* money was spent (A & D), or the speed of reconstruction (B). Their main issue was *who* was receiving the contracts – they believed it was unfairly going to people connected to Washington.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects what the conservatives were *not* criticizing, but rather focusing on.



"
Asinno ti mangdildillaw kadagiti kontrata ti rekonstruksion kadagiti panagregget ti Bagyo a Katrina a mangsaranay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti taga-uneg ti Washington**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti naruay a kritisismo bayat ti panangtarimaan ket nakaiturong iti ayan ti pannakaiyawat ti kontrata ti panangtarimaan kadagiti taga-uneg iti Washington."" (The resulting criticism during the bidding process was focused on the issue of awarding reconstruction contracts to those close to Washington.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Konserbatibo iti piskal:** While conservative fiscalists *criticized* the situation, they weren't the ones *receiving* the contracts.
*   **B: Dagiti napawayway:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Babassit a mulmula:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti umuna a makita dagiti silaw manipud iti spacecraft ti Stardust?","The correct answer is **B: Amianan ti California**.

The text states: ""ti 5 ti bigat (oras makindaya), namnamaem ti namayat a pabuya ti lawag para kadagiti umili idiay **Makin-amianan nga California**, Oregon, Nevada, ken Utah.""  This means the first people to see the light would be in Northern California.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti spacecraft ket mangipasdek iti rekord para iti ania kadagiti sumaganad?","The correct answer is **C: Panagsubli ditoy Daga ti kapartakan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti Stardust ket mangidasar ti baro a rekord a kas kapapaspasan a spacecraft nga agsubli iti Daga, a mangatiw ti daan a nairekord idi Mayo ti 1969 kabayatan ti panagsubli ti Apollo X modiul komando.""  This directly translates to ""Stardust will set a new record as the fastest spacecraft to *return to Earth*, breaking the old record...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Silsilawan iti kalalawaan nga langit** - The passage mentions the bright light it creates, but not a record for it.
*   **B: Maimatangan idiay kaaduan nga siudad** - It mentions being visible in several states, but not a record for visiting cities.
*   **D: Ti panagbiahe manipud San Francisco agingga iti Los Angeles ti kapartakan** - It uses the San Francisco to Los Angeles example to illustrate the *speed* of the craft, not as the record itself."
Kasano a nainaig ni Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ken ni Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **A: Kabsat a babai** (Sisters).

The text states: ""ti nanangna"" which translates to ""her mother."" However, the text also states that Saroja Balasubramanian is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother. Therefore, they are sisters. 

"
Sadinno ti nakasarakan ti bagi ni Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Idiay puon ti lugan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Inturongna dagiti opisial iti nangisit nga Oldsmobile Intrigue a luganna a 500 kadapan ti kaadayona. Sadiay, nasarakanda ti bagi ni Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, a naabbongan iti daradara nga ules.""  This translates to ""She directed officials to her black Oldsmobile Intrigue car 500 feet from her home. There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, covered in blood.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Idiay Cincinnati** - While Blue Ash (where she was found) is near Cincinnati, the body was specifically found *in* the car near her home, not just in the city.
*   **B: Sikigan iti kalsada** - She was found *near* a road, but the body was in the car.
*   **D: Idiay Pittsburgh** - She was a doctor in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio.



"
Ania ti nagatang ti eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Daytoy ti kadakkelan pay laeng a kompania a nagatang ti eBay."" (This is the largest company eBay has ever bought.) and mentions the benefits of acquiring ""Skype"" - expanding into markets like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.

Therefore, eBay bought **Skype**.



"
Ania ti sapsapulen ti eBay a maragpat babaen ti pannakagatang?,"The correct answer is **B: Palawaem kadagiti baro a teritoria**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the company hopes to ""makaala ti kinalatak dagiti lugar a ti Skype ket mangeggem ti napigsa a posision, a kas ti China, Makindaya nga Europa, ken Brazil."" This directly translates to *expanding into new territories*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pagtitipunen ti kitana** - While consolidation of resources *could* be a result, it's not the primary stated goal.
*   **C: Ipangato ti profile-na** -  Increasing profile is a potential benefit, but not the main driver behind the acquisition.
*   **D: Penneken dagiti shareholders-na** - Satisfying shareholders is always a goal, but it’s not directly mentioned as the reason *for this specific acquisition*.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti saan a nakilanglangen kadagiti balud a nagtalinaed iti paraangan kalpasan ti panaglalaban?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti negosiador**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pinadas dagiti negosiador a plastaren ti situasion, ngem dagiti kayat a mapasamak dagiti balud ket saan a nalawag.""  This translates to: ""Negotiators were sent to de-escalate the situation, but the demands of the inmates were unclear.""  The text implies the *inmates* are the ones who didn't want to return to their cells, not the negotiators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti tripulante a mangispal iti uram (Firefighters)** - The text only mentions them putting out the fire.
*   **C: Dagiti Opisiales (Officials)** - The text states officials *used* tear gas on the inmates, indicating they were involved in ending the standoff, not avoiding it.
*   **D: Dagiti empleado ti ospital (Hospital employees)** - The text mentions the hospital as where the injured were taken, but doesn't say anything about their involvement in the standoff.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakaigapuan ti panagatras dagiti balud kamaudiananna manipud iti riribuk?,"The correct answer is **B: Tear gas**.

The passage states: ""...sinerrek dagiti opisial nga addaan itiriot gear ti arubayan ket tiniliwda dagiti preso usar ti tear gas."" ( ""...officials with riot gear entered the courtyard and flushed out the prisoners using tear gas."")

This directly indicates that tear gas was used to force the inmates out of the courtyard. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naballigi a negosasion** - The passage states negotiations *failed* to clarify what the inmates wanted.
*   **C: Pada a nasugatan a balud** - The passage doesn't mention any injured inmates causing the retreat.
*   **D: Iti puor** - While the inmates initially began to exit through the door, it was tear gas that actually moved them out.



"
"Iti panagkuna ni Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ania ti rumbeng a wayawayaan ti pagilian ti Iran?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a panagpannuray iti langis**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described reliance on oil as ""maysa a palab-og"" (a weakness) *before* the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979 and that the country *needs to free itself from it*. This directly indicates his desire for the country to be independent from oil dependency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pinansial a restriksion:** While the passage mentions financial restrictions, it isn't what Khamenei wants to free the country *from*.
*   **B: Ti Islamiko a rebolusion:** The Islamic Revolution is mentioned as a point in time, but not what Khamenei wants the country to be free of.
*   **C: Baniaga a kita:** While oil exports contribute to income, the core issue is the *dependence* on that income, not the income itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti nangaklon kadagiti epekto ti sanction iti ekonomia ti Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Senior a pammataudan** (Senior source).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti komento, a live iti telebision, ti kaunaan a gundaway a ti maysa dagiti senior nga Iranian a taudan ti impormasion ket inakoda nga awan unay epekto dagiti naipakat a pananglapped."" This directly translates to ""Comments, live on television, were the first indication that one of the senior Iranian sources of information stated that the imposed sanctions had little effect.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: OPEC:** While OPEC reported a decrease in oil exports, they didn't comment on the *effect* of the sanctions. They simply reported the data.
*   **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He spoke about relying on oil being a ""mistake,"" but didn't assess the impact of sanctions.
*   **D: Ti European Union:** The EU is *affected* by the sanctions (regarding oil imports), but they didn't make a statement about the sanctions' impact on Iran's economy in this passage.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan kadi a paset ti proseso ti panagbutos ti France?,"The correct answer is **D: Butos a binilang dagiti representante ti kandidato.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision..."" It doesn't mention representatives of the candidates doing the counting. They are allowed to *observe* the process (B), but not to directly count the votes.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Transparent a kahon ti panagbutos** - The passage mentions urna (boxes) being checked for emptiness before voting begins, and implies they are visible. (though not explicitly transparent)
* **B: Dagiti representante nga imbaon dagiti kandidato** - The passage states ""candidates can send representatives to monitor all parts of the process.""
* **C: Panagpirma iti voting roll** - The passage explicitly states voters sign a list after depositing their ballot.



"
Sadinno ti pangipakitaan dagiti botante iti pinilida a kandidato?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti naimprentaan a panid ti papel**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""dagiti agbotos ket isinada ti bagbagida iti maysa a booth, **mangipan iti naimprentaan a papel a mangibaga ti binutosanda** iti maysa a sobre."" This directly translates to ""voters are seated in a booth, **presenting a printed paper stating who they voted for** in an envelope.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti maysa a voting roll** - The voting roll is a list to verify the voter's eligibility, not where their choice is indicated.
*   **C: Iti maysa a sobre** - The choice is *on* the paper *inside* the envelope, not the envelope itself.
*   **D: Iti makina iti uneg ti maysa a booth** - The description specifically says it's a low-tech process with paper, not a machine.



"
Ania ti nangiturong ken ni Allen a mangrugi iti walo a tawen a panagbirok kadagiti Musashi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti interesna iti gubat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...naibaga a ni Allen ket nangikabil iti adu a kinabaknangna iti panagsukisok iti marino ken iti panagsapulna iti Musashi **gapu iti tunggal-biag nga interesna kadagidiay a giera**."" (It was said that Allen invested a lot of his wealth in marine research and in searching for the Musashi **because of his lifelong interest in wars**.)

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are *results* of his interest in war, not the *reason* he started the search. He invested his wealth (A) *because* of his interest, he mapped the seafloor (B) *during* the search, and he did marine research (C) *as part of* the search.  The driving force was his lifelong fascination with warfare.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti nagastos ni Allen iti dakkel a gatad ti kuartana?","The correct answer is **A: Panangisubli iti Musashi** (Recovering the Musashi).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ni Allen ket nangikabil iti adu a kinabaknangna iti panagsukisok iti marino ken **iti panagsapulna iti Musashi** gapu iti tunggal-biag nga interesna kadagidiay a giera.""  This directly translates to ""Allen invested a lot of his fortune in marine research and **in finding the Musashi** because of his lifelong interest in those wars.""

While he *did* invest in marine research (B) and used an ROV (C) to find it, the ultimate goal and significant expense was the *recovery* of the Musashi itself.  Option D is part of the process, but not the main expenditure.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nalabit nangiturong kadagiti napeggad a kasasaad iti uneg ken aglawlaw ti mula?","The correct answer is **A: Gasolina ti uranium**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Manipud ti nuklear nga ahensia ti Japan...dagiti pagianan ti uranium fuel idiay lugar ket mabalin bemmtak ken naglepias."" (From the Japanese nuclear agency...the uranium fuel rods in the area may be damaged and leaking.) This directly links the potential for a dangerous situation to the uranium fuel.
* **The other options are consequences *of* the problem, not the source:**
    * **Radioaktibo a casesium (Radioactive cesium) & Iodine:** These are radioactive materials *detected* as a result of the leak, but they aren't the original cause.
    * **Puraw nga asuk (White smoke):** This is a *symptom* of the problem (the leak), not the underlying cause.

Therefore, the leaking **gasolina ti uranium (uranium fuel)** is what directly leads to the dangerous situation and the warnings issued to residents.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maysa kadagiti singasing iti kinatalged a naisingasing kadagiti lokal nga umili kalpasan ti pasamak iti planta?,"The correct answer is **A: Liklikan ti panagusar kadagiti air conditioning unit**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that residents were advised to **dependa dagiti airconda** (use air conditioners).  Options B, C, and D are all directly mentioned as warnings given to the residents:

*   **B: Agtaeng iti uneg** (Stay inside) -  ""agtalinaedda ti uneg ti balayda""
*   **C: Liklikan ti panaglang-ab iti puraw nga asuk** (Avoid the white smoke) - ""Impakita dagiti report iti telebision ti puraw nga asuk"" and the warning to avoid it.
*   **D: Liklikan ti uminum iti danum iti gripo** (Avoid drinking tap water) - ""saanda nga uminom iti danum ti gripo""

Therefore, avoiding the use of air conditioning units is the only instruction *not* found in the provided text."
"Segun ken Dr. Moll, ania ti pakaseknan unay maipapan iti XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Ti nangato ti fatality rate na**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Dr. Moll described the strain as “nakabutbuteng ken makapadanag gapu ti nakangatngato a bilang ti patayenna” which directly translates to ""dangerous and deadly because of the higher number of fatalities."" This is his primary concern about XDR-TB.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti variant ket nakaiwarnakan iti ospital** - While the passage mentions hospital transmission, it’s not Dr. Moll’s *primary* concern; it’s a *way* it spreads.
*   **B: Ti resistensia ti variant kadagiti droga** - The passage states it is Extremely Drug Resistant TB but Dr. Moll's quote emphasizes the *outcome* of that resistance (high fatality).
*   **C: Ti kaadu ti tattao a mabalin a maimpeksion ti maysa a naimpeksionan a tao** - The passage does state how many people one infected person can infect, but this is a detail, not Dr. Moll’s main point.



"
Mano a pasiente a nakaptan iti baro a variant ti nakumpirma nga empleado ti panangtaripato iti salun-at?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""...and thus happened to two or more workers in the hospital."" This directly answers the question about how many healthcare workers were confirmed to be infected with the new variant.



"
Ania a klase ti teknolohia ti us-usaren ti sistema ti NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknolohia a nakabase iti satellite**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mausar daytoy iti teknolohia a nakabase iti satellite kontra iti daan a teknolohia a nakabase iti radar ti daga..."" (It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology...).



"
Kasano a direkta a magunggonaan ti NextGen dagiti air traffic controller?,"The correct answer is **B: Ad-adda nga eksakto a lokasion dagiti eroplano**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...mapalubusan dagiti agkontrol iti trapiko idiay tangatang tapno matukoyda ti eksakto no ayan ti eroplano..."" (allows air traffic controllers to determine exactly where planes are).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ab-ababa a ruta ti panagtayab (Shorter flight paths):** While NextGen *results* in shorter routes, it doesn't directly *give* that to controllers. It provides the information allowing for shorter routes.
*   **C: Bimmassit ti panangiruar iti karbon (Reduced carbon emissions):** This is a *benefit* of NextGen, not how it directly impacts controllers.
*   **D: Basbassit nga pagaron (Less fuel):** Similar to carbon emissions, this is a *result* of NextGen, not the direct function for controllers.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a dinillaw dagiti historiador ti FBI gapu ta naipamaysada?","The correct answer is **C: Nadagsen ti panangipamaysa kadagiti kaso ti pornograpia.**

Here's why:

The passage states the historians discovered the FBI prioritized cases easy to solve (like car thefts) *and* specifically allocated 10 agents to pornography cases as part of this initiative.  Therefore, they *did* focus on pornography cases. The initiative was designed to inflate statistics, so focusing on easily solved cases (like stolen cars) and a specific, measurable type of crime (pornography) would help achieve that goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panangparang-ay iti balligida:** The passage states the goal *was* to improve statistics, so this is what the FBI was doing.
* **B: Panangiyanay kadagiti pammataudan kadagiti nalaka laeng a masolbar a krimen:** The passage explicitly states this *was* a focus of the initiative.
* **D: Natakaw a kaso ti kotse:** The passage states car thefts were a priority because they were easy to solve.



"
Ania ti piliten ti inisiatibo para ti kinaalas nga aramiden ti FBI?,"The correct answer is **C: Ipamaysam dagiti krimen a nalaka koma a solbaren**.

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI would prioritize cases ""easily solved,"" specifically auto theft, *to* increase the agency's clearance rate (solving crimes).  This means focusing on crimes that are easier to close.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While auto theft was *an example* of a case they'd focus on, the initiative wasn't *just* about car thefts.
*   **B:** Increasing agency clearance rate was the *result* of the initiative, not the initiative itself.
*   **D:** Dedicating agents to pornography cases was a specific (and arguably controversial) *request* for funding tied to the initiative, but not the core function of the initiative itself.



"
Ania ti napasamak iti lugan para ti puor a nagresponde iti pannakadungpar ti JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Nagtulid dayta**.

The text states: ""Impadamag ti lokal a media a ti lugan para ti puor ti eropuerto ket **nagtulatid** kabayatan nga agresresponde."" (Local media reported that the airport fire ground **slid** while responding.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nadungpar dayta** - While the Gripen *crashed*, the question asks about the fire ground.
* **C: Bimtak dayta** - The Gripen crashed, not the fire ground.
* **D: Naibus ti gasna** - This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Kalpasan ti pannakadungpar ti JAS 39C Gripen, naiserra ti airport iti ania?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti komersial a biahe**.

The text states: ""Ti JAS 39C Gripen ket naregreg ti maysa a pagpatayaban ti oras ti 9:30 am lokal nga oras... a nangitunda ti panagrekep ti airport kadagiti komersial a byahe.""  This directly translates to ""The JAS 39C Gripen made an emergency landing at 9:30 am local time... which delayed the opening of the airport to commercial flights.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Luglugan para ti puor** - The text says the fire suppression area was activated, but doesn't say the airport was closed *to* that area.
* **C: Lokal a media** - The local media *reported* on the incident, they weren't what the airport was closed to.
* **D: Dagiti Squadron Leader** - The pilot's rank is mentioned, but the airport wasn't closed to squadron leaders.



"
Asinno ti nangitukon ni Brzezinski iti panangiwanwan bayat ti Rebolusion ti Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states: ""Kas NSA, tinulunganna ni Carter a diplomatiko a mangasikaso kadagiti aramid ti lubong...iti Robolusion idiay Iran, a nangidaulo ti krisis ti pannakautibo idiay Iran, 1979..."" 

This clearly indicates that Brzezinski was assisting *Carter* in dealing with the Iranian Revolution.



"
Asinno ti nagtagtaginayon iti posision ti Advisor ti Nasional a Seguridad agingga 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states: ""simmaruno ken ni Henry Kissinger."" which translates to ""succeeded Henry Kissinger."" This means Kissinger held the position *before* Brzezinski, who started in 1977.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga umiso a mangipakita iti karera ni Bobek iti Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Isu ket nakagun-od ti nasurok a 468 a goal bayat ti panagay-ayamna para iti grupo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.** Option A claims he scored *over* 468 goals, which is incorrect.
* **B, C, and D are all supported by the text:**
    * **B:** ""Awanen ti nakaaramid iti ad-adu a pannakaparang wenno nakaaramid iti adu a puntos para iti klab no saan a ni Bobek."" (No one scored more or played more for the club than Bobek)
    * **C:** ""Idi 1995 nabutosan isuna a kalalaingan nga agay-ayam iti pakasaritaan ti Partizan."" (In 1995 he was voted the greatest player in Partizan history)
    * **D:** The text implies he played in more games than others, as no one had more appearances.



"
Ania a keddeng maipapan iti pakasaritaan ni Bobek ken ni Partizan Belgrade ti pudno?,"The correct answer is **A: Isu ket nangrugi nga agay-ayam para iti Partizan idi 1945**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kinaduana ida idi 1945 ken nagbati inggana 1958."" (They joined in 1945 and played until 1958.) This clearly indicates he started playing for Partizan in 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isu ket nagayam para iti Zagreb sakbay ti Partizan Belgrade** - The passage states he was *in* Zagreb, but not that he *played for* a Zagreb team. It says he played *while in* Zagreb, for Partizan.
* **C: Isu ket nagayam para iti Partizan agingga 1995** - The passage says he played until 1958, not 1995. 1995 is the year he was voted greatest player.
* **D: Nagun-odna ti kinalatak kalpasan a nabutosan a kas kalalaingan nga agay-ayam ti Partizan** - While being voted greatest player contributed to his fame, he was already well-known *because* of his incredible scoring record *before* 1995.  The passage emphasizes his achievements *during* his playing career.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kababalin ti mangilasin iti Hesperonychus manipud iti Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Adda dayta maikadua nga dakdakel nga kuko** (It has a second larger claw).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dakdakkel ti maikadua a kukona, nga isu ti nakapanagananna iti Hesperonychus a kayatna a sawen ket ‘lumaud a kuko.’""  This directly translates to ""Its second claw is larger, which is what gave Hesperonychus its name, meaning ‘western claw.’""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Addaan dayta ti dua a gurong** (It has two wheels) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Adda dayta dutdot iti buo nga bagi** (It has scales on its whole body) - The passage only mentions scales on its *feet*.
*   **D: Nabara iti dara na** (It has feathered arms) - The passage says it had feathered arms, but this isn't a distinguishing characteristic *from* Velociraptor, as Velociraptor is also thought to have had feathers.



"
Ti kaipapanan ti “Hesperonychus” ket nagtaud iti ania a pisikal a pakabigbigan ti sebbangan?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti (kuk)kuko**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dakdakkel ti maikadua a kukona, nga isu ti nakapanagananna iti Hesperonychus a kayatna a sawen ket “lumaud a kuko.”""  This translates to: ""Its second claw is larger, which is what gave Hesperonychus its name, meaning “western claw.”"" 

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonychus"" originates from the physical characteristic of its claws.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipanggep iti paltugan iti pudno?,"The correct answer is **D: Napasamak ti pammaltog idiay Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Nagpan idiay Buffalo tapno makipagragsak a kadua dagiti gagayyem ken kakabagian. Ti 30-tawen nga asawa a lalaki...ket maysa kadagiti uppat a natay iti pannakapaltog..."" This clearly indicates the shooting happened in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isuda a dua nga agasawa ket naggapu Texas:** The passage states they *got married* in Texas a year ago, but doesn't say both couples are *from* Texas.
*   **B: Adda lima a nadangranan:** The passage says *four* people died, not five were injured.
*   **C: Nagkallaysada ti agassawa makatawen sakbayna idiay Buffalo:** The passage says they *traveled* to Buffalo for the anniversary, not that they lived there previously.



"
Ania a keddeng maipapan iti pasamak a nakapasamakan ti pannakapaltog ti pudno?,"The correct answer is **A: Napasamak dayta iti maysa nga anibersario a party idiay Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Nagpakasar manen ti agpares idiay Texas maysa tawen ti napalabas ken napan idiay Buffalo tapno makipagragsak a kadua dagiti gagayyem ken kakabagian."" and ""...ti pannakapaltog...ket napan idiay Buffalo...""
* This clearly indicates the shooting happened *at* an anniversary party *in* Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Napasamak dayta iti pormal a pannakaangay ti anibersario:** While the party was *for* the anniversary, the text doesn't specify it was the formal event itself where the shooting occurred.
* **C: Napasamak dayta iti maysa a panagrarambak idiay Texas:** The couple married in Texas but returned to Buffalo for the celebration. The shooting happened in Buffalo.
* **D: Napasamak dayta iti kasar dagiti agassawa:** The shooting happened *at a party* celebrating the anniversary, not during the wedding itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti immuna a pakaseknan dagiti opisial maipapan iti Luno?","The correct answer is **A: Awan ti karga ti abono** (No fertilizer cargo).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...idi umuna mabuteng dagiti opisial a baka maibelleng iti barko dagiti kargana."" This translates to ""...initially officials thought the cargo might be able to be saved from the ship."" This implies their *first* concern was the cargo, and they were considering if it could be recovered. The text doesn't mention fertilizer specifically, but it *does* say the ship was carrying a ""gagangay a kargana a ganagan"" - meaning a large grain cargo. The other options are things that *happened* but weren't the initial thought of the officials.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dalluyon ken napigsa nga angin** (Waves and strong winds) - These caused the oil to spill, but weren't the officials' initial concern.
*   **C: Panagbukbok ti gasolina** (Gasoline explosion) -  The text talks about crude oil, not gasoline, and doesn't mention an explosion as the first concern.
*   **D: Posible a pannakadangran dagiti tripulante** (Possible injury to the crew) - While the crew was rescued, the text doesn't state this was their first thought. The focus is initially on the cargo.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan iti pannakadadael ti Luno ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **D: Naiduron ti barko iti breakwater**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the ship was driven into the ocean by high winds and waves (""nangiduron kadagitoy iti taaw"").** It does *not* mention a breakwater. A breakwater is a man-made structure, and the text specifically describes natural forces causing the damage.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: Napasamak ti pannakadadael sakbay a naala ti karga.** (The damage happened before the cargo was loaded.) - The text says officials *first* thought the cargo might be loaded *onto* the ship, implying it wasn't already loaded when the incident occurred.
* **B: Adda 100 a metro a gasolina ti barko idi nadadael.** (The ship had 100 meters of gasoline when it was damaged.) - The text states it had 120-160 *cubic meters of crude oil* (krudo), which isn't gasoline, but the amount is approximately 100.
* **C: Manipud iti sangapulo ket dua a tripulante, maysa ti nasugatan.** (Out of twelve crew members, one was injured.) - The text states twelve crew members were rescued by helicopter, and that one person was seriously injured (""napapar nga agong"").



"
Iti ania a dekada a nagun-od ti Algeria ti wayawaya?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960s**.

The passage states Vautier returned to ""newly independent Algeria"" in 1960. This directly implies Algeria gained its independence in the 1960s.



"
Sadinno ti saan a naipasdek nga iskrin dagiti telebision para iti seremonia ti pumpon?,"The correct answer is **D: Idiay St. Peter's Square**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the number of people attending the funeral was so large that *not everyone could fit in St. Peter's Square*. This led to the need for large television screens to be set up in *different parts of Rome* and other cities so people *could watch the ceremony*.  Therefore, screens weren't *not* installed in St. Peter's Square – the issue was there wasn't enough space *within* St. Peter's Square for everyone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iti intero a Roma** - The passage says screens *were* set up in various parts of Rome.
*   **B: Iti nadumaduma a siudad ti Italia** - Screens *were* set up in other cities in Italy.
*   **C: Iti sumagmamano a lugar idiay Poland** - Screens *were* set up in Poland.



"
Sadinno ti nakaangayan ti seremonia ti pumpon?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti nadumaduma a lugar iti intero a Roma**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that large television screens were set up in *various parts of Rome* to allow people to view the ceremony because the crowds were too large for St. Peter's Square. 
* While the ceremony *originated* in Rome (specifically near St. Peter's Square), the viewing was extended to many locations *throughout* the city.
* Option B (Poland) is mentioned as having a similar setup, but is not where the ceremony itself took place.
* Option C (St. Peter's Square) is where people *wanted* to be, but couldn't all fit.
* Option D is partially correct (it started in Rome) but doesn't capture the widespread viewing within Rome itself.



"
"Kalpasan ti panagbettak, asinno ti naagasan gapu kadagiti nakaro a pannakadangran?","The correct answer is **A: Di kumurang a lima a tao**.

The passage states: ""...ngem saan a bumaba iti lima a tao nga adda iti lugar iti kanito ti panagbettak ti naagasan para kadagiti sintomas ti pannakakigtot."" ( ...but no less than five people in the area were evacuated for symptoms of exposure.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Awan** - The passage specifically states five people were affected.
* **C: Opisial ti kompania ti gas** - While an official *was* present, the passage doesn't say they were affected.
* **D: Maysa a karruba** - The neighbor *called* about the leak, but wasn't necessarily affected themselves.



"
Asinno ti nangipadamag iti panagruar ti gas?,"The correct answer is **A: Maysa a kaarruba iti pasdek** (A neighbor).

The passage states: ""Idi simmangpet ti opisial, bimtak diay apartment. Awan ti naipadamag a nakaro a pannakadangra, ngem saan a bumaba iti lima a tao nga adda iti lugar iti kanito ti panagbettak ti naagasan para kadagiti sintomas ti pannakakigtot. Awan agtaltalinaed idiay uneg iti apartamento.""  and ""...maysa a karruba ti timmawag maipapan iti simngaw a gas.""

This clearly indicates that a neighbor was the one who reported the gas leak, essentially ""causing"" the response/investigation. While the gas leak itself wasn't *caused* by the neighbor, they were the catalyst for the events described.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, mano a tattao ti natay iti panangraut?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Dagiti natay ket da Nicholas Alden, 25, ken Zachary Cuddeback, 21."" This directly translates to ""The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21,"" meaning two people died.



"
Akinkua ti armas a naipaay a nagputok iti maysa a punto bayat ti panangraut?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Pimmalpak ti armas iti Uka bayat a nakatutok iti ulo..."" which translates to ""The weapon malfunctioned in Uka while pointed at the head..."" This directly indicates the weapon discharged *in* Uka.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti nabutos nga ikatten iti programa ti Olympics?,"The correct answer is **B: Rugby**.

The text explicitly states: ""Napili ti Rugby, kangrunaan ti rugby union, ken ti golf manipud iti lima a dadduma pay nga sport a maikonsidera a maisali iti Olympics."" (Rugby, especially rugby union, and golf were chosen from five other sports to be considered for inclusion in the Olympics.)

The other options are mentioned as *not* being selected:

*   **Squash, Karate, Baseball, and Softball** were all proposed but ""saan a napalubosan dagitoy Olympics Games idi 2005"" (were not approved for the Olympic Games in 2005).



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga isports ti binutosan ti International Olympic Committee a mairaman kadagiti ay-ayam?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The text explicitly states: ""Napili ti Rugby, kangrunaan ti rugby union, ken ti golf..."" which means rugby union was voted by the International Olympic Committee to be included in the games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rollersports** - The text says roller sports *were* considered but not approved.
*   **B: Baseball** - The text says baseball *were* considered but not approved.
*   **D: Softball** - The text says softball *were* considered but not approved.



"
Orihinal nga inabangan ni Arthur Guinness ti St James’ Gate Brewery iti mano a tawen?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The text explicitly states: ""Idi Setiembre 24, 1759, nagpirma ni Arthur Guinness ti **9,000 a tawen** a panangabang ti St James' Gate Brewery...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - This is how long the business *lasted* but not the original lease length.
*   **B: 10** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: 1759** - This is the year the lease was signed, not the lease duration.



"
Agarup mano a bilion a doliar ti iyeg ti Guinness iti kada tawen?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states that Guinness makes over 10 billion euro per year, which is equivalent to US$14.7 billion. The closest option to 14.7 is 14.



"
Iti mano a pagilian iti European Union ti nailasin ti H5N1 virus?,"The correct answer is **C: Pito**.

The passage states: ""Ti France ti maikapito a pagilian iti European Union nga agsagaba iti daytoy a virus; simmaruno iti Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece ken Italia."" This means there are seven countries (France plus the six listed) in the EU where the H5N1 virus has been detected.



"
Sadinno a nailasin ti kaudian a kaso ti H5N1 virus?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage states: ""The H5N1, which is a highly pathogenic avian influenza that can kill humans, has been confirmed in a dead wild duck found on Monday in a pond near Lyon in northern France."" This directly answers the question of where the latest confirmed case was found.



"
Kaano ti naudi a pannakasabat ti Haiti iti sakit sakbay ti panagsaknap gapu kadagiti mangtaginayon iti kappia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti 1800s**.

The passage states: ""Sakbay ti panagsangpet dagiti tropa, saan pay a naipasango ti Haiti kadagiti problema a mainaig iti sakit manipud pay idi 1800."" This directly answers the question of when Haiti last experienced disease problems *before* the outbreak linked to the peacekeepers.



"
Dagiti basura manipud iti ania a lugar ti nakatulong iti panagwaras ti sakit?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti kampo ti UN**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sigun iti darum, ti basura a naggapu iti kampo iti UN ket saan a na-sanitize a nasayaat, a pakaigapuan iti pannakaserrek ti mikrobio iti waig ti Karayan ti Artibonite..."" 

This means the waste *from the UN camp* was the source of the outbreak, which then contaminated the Artibonite River.



"
Ania ti plano nga aramiden ti gobierno ti Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Dekriminalisaren ti droga**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the government needs legislation to ""improve the situation"" regarding public health and criminal justice in relation to drugs.** This implies a fundamental change in how drugs are handled.
* **The Minister of Health expressed support for both those who challenge the temporary legality of substances *and* for overturning convictions from past, unconstitutional changes.** This strongly suggests a move away from criminalizing drug use.
* **""Dekriminalisaren"" (decriminalize) means removing criminal penalties for possession of drugs.**  This aligns with overturning past convictions and addressing the issue through public health rather than criminal justice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mangiwaras kadagiti pannakakonbiktar kadagiti nakabasol iti droga (To release those convicted of drug offenses):** While releasing convicts is *part* of the plan, it's a consequence of decriminalization, not the primary plan itself.
* **B: Mangipaulog kadagiti naing-inget a linteg maipapan iti pannakaipalubos ti droga (To impose stricter laws regarding drug allowance):** This is the opposite of what the text suggests.
* **C: Palawaen dagiti linteg maipapan iti pannakaipalubos ti droga (To broaden the laws regarding drug allowance):** Similar to B, this isn't supported by the text.



"
Ania ti temporario a legal idiay Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti droga** (Drugs).

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""temporario a legalidad dagiti mairaman a substansia"" (temporary legality of included substances) and refers to individuals ""manggundaway iti temporario a legalidad dagiti mairaman a substansia"" (challenging the temporary legality of included substances).  This clearly points to drugs being the temporarily legalized substance being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagtakaw** (Theft) - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Panagkusit** (Kidnapping) - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Mangdarup** (Gambling) - Not mentioned in the text.



"
Ania ti maimbestigaran ti mapapati a nakabasol?,"The correct answer is **A: Trespassing**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the man is being investigated for *trespassing* instead of vandalism. The police spokesperson clarifies that no damage was done to the sign itself – the alteration was done using tarps, not by damaging the original structure.  Trespassing involves being on someone else's property without permission, which is what the investigation focuses on.



"
"Idi binalbaliwanna ti karatula, ania ti saan nga inaramid ti suspek?","The correct answer is **C: Pisikal nga indadael (Physically damaged)**.

The passage specifically states ""Saan a nadadael ti mismo a karatula"" (The sign itself was not damaged). The suspect altered it *without* causing physical damage, using tarpaulin to change the appearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baliwan ti maysa kadagiti letrana (Changed one of the letters):** The passage clearly states the suspect altered the ""O"" to look like an ""e"".
*   **B: Dekorasionan iti simbolo ti kappia (Decorated with a peace symbol):** The tarpaulin *was* decorated with peace symbols and hearts.
*   **D: Agusar iti tarpaulin tapno mabaliwan (Used tarpaulin to alter):** The suspect definitely used tarpaulin to make the change.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad iti haan mapabasolen ken maestro ti Ingles a ni Karno?","The correct answer is **B: Agararem iti agad-adal** (Questioning students' learning).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""kasla gayyem isuna dagiti estudiante"" (He treats students like playthings). This implies he *challenges* their learning, possibly through unconventional methods, but doesn't necessarily mean he doubts their ability to learn.  It's more about his behavior *towards* the students rather than doubting their learning capacity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagsalungasing iti pagpatalged a kukuw ti nagaramid** (Opposing the established curriculum of the creator) - The text doesn't mention anything about opposing a curriculum.
* **C: Panagimprenta kadagiti di autorisado nga anunsio** (Printing unauthorized advertisements) - The text *specifically states* Moderno nga Edukasion blamed him for this: ""Pinabasol ti Moderno nga Edukasion isuna iti panagimprenta iti dadakkel nga anunsio kadagiti bus nga awanan pammalubos...""
* **D: Aagus-usar iti dakes a sao iti klase** (Using vulgar language in class) - The text also *directly states* he was accused of this: ""ken maatap nga agus-usar isuna iti dakes a sao iti klase.""



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti saan a hostage ni Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti retratista (The photojournalists)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Dagiti ritratista iti di agbayag innalada ti puesto iti maysa a baket gapu ta masapulna iti agbanio."" (The photojournalists were quickly moved to a safe location because they needed to report.)  This indicates they were *not* held hostage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Turturista (Tourists):** The passage clearly states the tourists were taken hostage (""In-hostage ti maysa a dati a polis a Filipino dagiti turista a naggapu iti Hong Kong..."").
*   **B: Dagiti pulis (Police):** While the perpetrator was a former police officer, the *tourists* were the hostages.
*   **C: Ubbing (Children):** The passage mentions children were among the hostages (""Innem kadagiti nakautibo, agraman dagiti ubbing ket babbaket ken lallakay, ket napalubosan a nasapa..."").



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti hostage a saan a nakumpirmaan a nasapa a nawayawayaan?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti turista**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Innem kadagiti nakautibo, agraman dagiti ubbing ket babbaket ken lallakay, ket napalubosan a nasapa..."" which means the children, women, and elderly *were* released early.  It also says the Filipino photojournalists were released early.  Therefore, the only group not explicitly stated as being released early are the tourists.

The question asks for those *not* confirmed to have been released early.
"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti mangur-urnong kadagiti pirma a mangsuporta iti pannakaipaulog a legal ti panagasawa ti agpada a sekso idiay Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti agproprotesta**.

The passage states: ""Mangnamnama dagiti agproprotesta a makakolektada iti petision a 1.2 a milion a pirma tapno ipresentada iti National Congress inton Nobiembre.""  This directly indicates that the protesters are the ones collecting the signatures.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He currently *holds* the amended legislation, but isn't collecting signatures.
* **C: Ti Simbaan ti Romano Katoliko:** The passage states they *oppose* legalization, not support it.
* **D: Marta Suplicy:** She originally *wrote* the bill, but isn't currently collecting signatures.



"
Asinno ti pagitedan dagiti agprotprotesta iti petisionda?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti National Congress ti Brazil**.

The text states the protesters hope to present the 1.2 million signature petition *to* the National Congress in November. This means they are petitioning the National Congress.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti Simbaan ti Romano Katoliko** - The text says the Catholic Church *opposes* same-sex marriage, not that the protesters are petitioning them.
* **B: Roberto Jefferson** - He currently holds the amended legislation, but isn't the target of the petition.
* **D: Ti mayor ti São Paolo** - While the original bill was written by the former mayor, the petition isn't directed to her.



"
"Segun iti inbaga ni Armand Versace, ania ti direkta a napasamak sakbay a nangrugi ti panagtignay ti bunggoy iti paniempo?","The correct answer is **A: Nangrugin nga uraro (It started to rain)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lima minuto pay laeng a nakapakita ket **nangrugin nga agangin**, maysa minuto kalpasanna, dumanon ti angin iti 70km kada oras."" (Only five minutes had passed when **it started to rain**, a minute later, the wind reached 70km per hour.)

The question asks what *directly* happened before the storm's intensity increased. The passage clearly states rain began just before the wind picked up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lima a minuto ti likudan ti display (Five minutes behind the display):** This refers to the time *passing* before the rain, not what *happened* before the storm intensified.
*   **C: Adda dagiti napigsa nga angin (There were strong winds):** The strong winds came *after* the rain started.
*   **D: Napukawna ti maysa a kameng ti pamiliana (He lost a family member):** This is a consequence *of* the storm, not something that happened *before* it became intense.



"
"Segun ken Versace, kaano a nangrugi dagiti kapigsaan nga angin?","The correct answer is **A: Sumagmamano a minuto kalpasan a nangrugi ti display**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lima minuto pay laeng a nakapakita ket nangrugin nga agangin..."" This translates to ""Only five minutes into the show, the wind started...""  It then continues to say a minute after that, the wind reached 70km/h.  Therefore, the strong winds began *a few minutes* after the display (show) started.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kalpasan ti tudo (After the rain):** The rain of ice came *after* the winds started.
* **C: Kalpasan a napukawna ti kabsatna a babai (After he lost his sister):**  His sister's disappearance is a *result* of the storm, not the cause of it.
* **D: Sakbay ti uraro (Before the rain):** The text specifically states the wind started *during* the display, before the ice rain.



"
"Sakbay ni Fred, mano a dadakkel a bagyo ti nairekord iti daya ti 35°W?","The correct answer is **C: Dua**.

The text states: ""Ni Fred ti kapipigsaan pay laeng a nairekord a tropikal a bagyo iti abagatan ken daya ti Atlantiko sipud pannakaimbento ti satellite imagery, ken daytoy pay laeng ti maikatlo a kangrunaan a bagyo nga adda iti rekord iti daya ti 35˚W."" 

This means that before Fred, there were two major hurricanes recorded east of 35°W."
"Idi adda ni Fred iti asideg dagiti isla ti Cape Verde, ania a direksion ti pagturonganna?","The correct answer is **D: Amianan a Laud**.

The text states: ""Ni Fred ket addaan ti angin nga 105 a milia kada oras (165 km/h) ti agdama ken **agturturong iti amianan a laud**."" (Fred currently has winds of 105 miles per hour (165 km/h) and is moving **northwest**.)



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti naparpartak ti kapartak ngem kadagiti immun-una?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Adayo a napaspaspas dagiti pegges ti 802.11n ngem kadagiti immun-una..."" which translates to ""802.11n speeds are much faster than its predecessors...""

The other options are all earlier standards that 802.11n was designed to be backward compatible with and therefore *slower* than.



"
Ania ti kasapulan tapno ti 802.11n ket Palubosan daytoy a paatras iti 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Doble a radio**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Palubosan daytoy a paatras a maibagay iti 802.11a, 802.11b ken 802.11g, **basta la ketdi addaan dua a radio ti base station.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nakapatpateg a naparpartak ti kapartak:** While beamforming is a feature of 802.11n, it's not *required* for backward compatibility with 802.11b.
* **B: Ti abilidad para iti 802.11b nga ag-operate iti 5.0Ghz:** 802.11b operates on the 2.4GHz frequency, not 5.0GHz.
* **C: Ti throughput a 600Mbit/s:**  This is the *maximum* speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for backward compatibility.  802.11b has a much lower maximum speed.



"
Mano a pasamak ti paglanguyan ti nakaala iti balitok a medalia iti Commonwealth Games?,"The correct answer is **B: Tallo**.

The passage states the swimmer competed in ""tallo a relay"" (three relays) in addition to the 100m and 200m freestyle, making a total of five events. However, the question asks how many *swimming events* the medal-winning swimmer participated in at the Commonwealth Games. The relays are considered single events, and there are three of them mentioned.

Therefore, the answer is three.



"
Apay a saan nga agtomtomar ti nakaala iti balitok a medalia iti Olympics iti agas para iti ut-otna?,"The correct answer is **C: Madanagan a negatibo ti epektona iti kinasalun-atna.**

Here's why:

The passage states the athlete was ""napagduaduaanda ti salun-atna"" (their health was doubted) and couldn't take the necessary medication because it was prohibited in the Games. This directly implies the medication would have helped their condition, but the risk of negative health effects or violating rules prevented them from taking it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Awan ti ut-otna** (They don't have an illness) - The passage clearly indicates they *have* a health concern requiring medication.
*   **B: Pinagsakitna ti riknana** (Their kidney hurts) - The passage doesn’t mention anything about kidney pain.
*   **D: Saan a maipalubos dayta iti Commonwealth Games** (It's not allowed in the Commonwealth Games) - While this is *part* of the problem, it's not the reason *why* they couldn't take the medication. The underlying reason is the doubt about their health and potential negative effects.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a nangiturong iti pannakariro maipapan iti aktibidad ti gingined?","The correct answer is **A: Ti kaadda dagiti nasipnget nga ulep**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti ulap ket nangited iti posible a panagriribuk no adda talaga ti napasamak a panagputok iti bulkan."" (The clouds gave rise to the possibility of a volcanic eruption.) This directly links the dark clouds to the concern and speculation about volcanic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti padamag manipud iti Meteorolohikal nga Opisina ti Icelandic** - The Meteorological Office *reported no activity*, which *reduced* concern, it didn't cause it.
* **C: Ti mapa iti gingined iti lubong** - The map showed activity elsewhere, but didn't directly lead to the worry about Hekla.
* **D: Aktibidad a naireport iti dadduma a lugar ti Iceland** - The passage focuses on concerns specifically about Hekla, not general activity in Iceland.



"
"Segun iti paset, kaano a napasamak ti panagbalbaliw ti paset?","The correct answer is **C: Idi Marso 10**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti kangrunaan nga aktibidad ti gingined a nagresulta iti panagbaliw iti saad a napasamak **idi Marso 10** idiay amianan a daya iti sikig ti wangawangan iti tuktok ti bulkan."" (The main seismic activity that resulted in a change in state occurred **on March 10** northeast of the edge of the crater at the top of the volcano.)



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan iti Chandrayaan-1’s lunar probe ti saan a pudno?,"The correct answer is **A: Adda tripulante ti orbiter a nangilansa iti probe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the probe *impacted* the moon.** This implies it was a self-contained unit and didn't require a crew to ""launch"" it.  The orbiter *carried* the probe, but didn't actively launch it in the sense of having people inside.
* **B: Naglaon ti probe kadagiti napateg nga instrumento** - The passage directly states ""it carried three important scientific instruments.""
* **C: Naballigi ti pannakaiparuar ti probe** -  The passage states it ""landed near the south pole of the Moon.""
* **D: Adda napintaan a sikigan ti probe** - The passage mentions the probe carried the Indian flag painted on its side.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti siuumiso a mangiladawan iti lunar probe?,"The correct answer is **B: Naballigi ti crash landing-na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""a simmiwet iti rabaw ti Bulan"" which translates to ""crashed onto the surface of the Moon."" It also specifies it was a controlled crash, landing near the south pole.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nagdisso dayta iti asideg ti amianan a pole ti Bulan** - The passage says it landed near the *south* pole.
* **C: Nairuar dayta manipud iti maysa nga orbiter nga addaan tao** - The passage states it was a probe from the Chandrayaan-1 *lunar orbiter*, but doesn't mention it being crewed (addaan tao).
* **D: Dua a napateg nga instrumento ti awitna dayta** - The passage says it carried *three* important scientific instruments.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a wagas ti proteksion kontra iti sakit ti maudi a maipatungpal?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti bakuna nga encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government *ordered* millions of encephalitis vaccines to help health agencies for the next year. While other measures were taken (pesticides, culling pigs, mosquito nets), the vaccine order is presented as a future action still to be implemented, making it the most recent protective measure mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti pestisidio (Pesticides):**  Pesticides were *already* being distributed, not a future action.
*   **B: Dagiti agtiliw iti baboy (Culling pigs):**  Culling pigs was *already* done as a response.
*   **D: Dagiti kurtina ti lamok (Mosquito nets):** Mosquito nets were *already* distributed, not a future action.



"
Kasano a mayakar ti sakit kadagiti tattao?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti lamok** (Mosquitoes).

The passage explicitly states: ""umakar kadagiti tao babaen dagiti lamok"" (spreads to people through mosquitoes).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pestisidio** (Pesticides) - Pesticides are *used to combat* the mosquitoes, not how the disease spreads.
* **C: Dagiti baboy** (Pigs) - The disease is *in* the pigs, but it doesn't directly jump from pig to human.
* **D: Dagiti agtiliw iti baboy** (Piglets) -  While culling piglets is a measure taken to control the spread, they aren't the *method* of transmission to humans.



"
Ti pannakapaay ti maikadua a sentensia ket mabalin nga agtungpal iti ania a pagbanagan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti pannakaiparit dagiti sibil a panagtipon ti agpada a sekso** (The prohibition of civil unions of the same sex).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...iti pannakapaay ti maikadua a sentensia, a mangisingsingasing iti pannakaiparit ti sibil a panagtipon dagiti agpada ti seksona, ket mabalin a luktanna ti ruangan para kadagiti sibil a panagtipon iti masakbayan."" This directly translates to: ""...with the removal of the second sentence, which seeks to prohibit civil unions of the same sex, could open the room for civil unions in the future.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti dagus a panangrepaso iti HJR-3** (The immediate review of HJR-3) - The passage mentions review in future legislatures, not immediate review.
*   **B: Maysa a masanguanan a kalintegan kadagiti sibil a panagtipon ti agpada a sekso** (A definitive legalization of same-sex civil unions) - The removal of the prohibition *could* lead to legalization, but it doesn't *guarantee* it. The passage only says it ""could open the room.""
*   **C: Maysa nga emerhensia a lehislatibo a sesion** (An emergency legislative session) - The passage doesn't mention any emergency session.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a naikkat ti maikadua a sentensia?","The correct answer is **A: Kabayatan ti lehislatibo a sesion**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maysa a panangbaliw ti naaramid iti daytoy a sesion a lehislatibo idi a ti maikadua a sentensia ket inikkat..."" This directly translates to ""A change was made during the legislative session where the second sentence was removed...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Idi 2011** - While the amendment *happened* in 2011, the sentence removal specifically occurred *during* a legislative session within that year.
* **C: Inton Lunes** - Lunes is just the day the Senate passed the bill in its amended form, not when the sentence was removed.
* **D: Idi 2015** - 2015 is when the resolution would be revisited, not when the sentence was initially removed.



"
Siasino ti nakairuaran dagiti “Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti opisina ti abogado a Mossack Fonseca**.

The passage clearly states: ""Ti “Panama Papers” ti awag para kadagiti mangbukel a pagaraup sangapulo milion a dokumento nga aggapu iti opisina ti abogado a taga-Panama a Mossack Fonseca..."" (The ""Panama Papers"" refers to a massive leak of ten million documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca...)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti pagiwarnak (The Guardian):** While The Guardian *published* the papers, they didn't originate them.
* **C: Bangko iti Deutsche (Deutsche Bank):** The bank was involved in facilitating shell companies, but didn't leak the documents.
* **D: Dagiti daulo ti gobierno ti Iceland (The government heads of Iceland):** They were affected by the papers, but didn't create them.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, asinno ti imbaga ti pagiwarnak a Briton a mangimatmaton iti adu kadagiti kompania a maus-usar a mangilemmeng iti kinabaknang?","The correct answer is **C: Bangko iti Deutsche**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Adda dagiti protesta iti sangalubongan, sumagmamano a pannakausig kadagiti kriminal, ken agpada a nagikkat dagiti daulo ti gobierno ti Iceland ken Pakistan. Impasimudaag ti pagiwarnak a Briton a The Guardian a kontrolado ti Deutsche Bank ti agarup kakatlo ti 1200 a shell company a nausar tapno maaramid daytoy.""

This directly identifies the Deutsche Bank as controlling a large number of the shell companies used for hiding wealth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Babaknang a kliente ti nadumaduma a banko:** While wealthy clients *used* the shell companies, they didn't *control* them.
*   **B: Ti opisina ti abogado a Panamanian:** Mossack Fonseca created the shell companies, but the passage states Deutsche Bank controlled many of them.
*   **D: Gobierno iti Pakistan:** The government of Pakistan was affected by the papers (leading to a leader's resignation), but wasn't controlling the companies.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aksidente eroplano ti kaaduan ti natay?,"The correct answer is **A: Pannakatnag ti eroplano bayat ti panagturongna idiay Armenia manipud Iran**.

Here's why:

The text states that the plane crash to Armenia resulted in the death of **168 passengers**, which is significantly higher than the other accidents mentioned:

*   Helicopter crash: 3 deaths
*   Mashhad crash: 17 deaths

Therefore, the Armenia crash had the highest number of fatalities."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a makaigapu iti nakaad-adu nga aksidente iti eroplano a mapaspasamak idiay Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti sanction a manglapped iti panaggatang kadagiti baro nga eroplano.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dagiti internasional a linteg ket ipatarusna a dagiti baro nga eroplano ket saan a mabalin a magatang."" (International laws prevent the purchase of new airplanes.) This refers to sanctions.  Sanctions *prevent* purchases, they don't *cause* accidents directly.  They contribute to the problem of an aging fleet, but aren't the direct cause of crashes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti daan nga armada dagiti sibil ken militar nga eroplano** -  The passage mentions the aging fleet as a contributing factor to accidents. It *is* a cause.
* **B: Ti kinakurang ti badyet a mangipalubos iti panaggatang kadagiti baro nga eroplano** - While related to the sanctions, the sanctions are the direct constraint, not simply a lack of budget.
* **D: Saan a nasayaat ti pannakamantenerna a bunggoy dagiti eroplano** - The passage specifically mentions poor maintenance (""saan a nasayaat ti pannakamantenirna"") as a problem. It *is* a cause.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a karaman ti padamag gapu ti Grupo ti Panagadal ti Iraq?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a deklarasion a babaen ti sumagmamano a panagbalbaliw, maliklikan ti dumakdakkel a kinaranggas idiay Iraq.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Impakdaarna nga Awan iti makasigurado nga aniaman iti aramiden idiay Iraq iti daytoy a kanito ket mangpasardeng iti gubat, panagraira iti kinabayolente, wenno iti papan iti riribok.**"" (They stated that nothing done in Iraq at this time can guarantee the end of war, reduce violence, or stabilize the situation.)

This directly contradicts option B, which suggests they believe changes *can* avoid increased chaos.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and therefore *not* the answer:

*   **A: Panangdillaw ti agdama a polisiya** - The text says the report is ""kritikal la unay ti dandani amin nga aspekto ti agdama a polisia"" (very critical of all aspects of the current policy).
*   **C: Rekomendasion tapno masigurado dagiti border ti Iraq** - The passage states their first recommendation is a diplomatic initiative ""tapno masalakniban ti border ti Iraq kontra kadagiti naranggas nga ibaballaet"" (to secure Iraq's borders against foreign interference).
*   **D: Ti pangaasi iti concensus ti US** - The report began ""adda ti pangaasi iti nawaya a debate ken ti panagaramid ti concensus ti Estados Unidos"" (with support for free debate and building US consensus).



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a ginuyogoy ti Grupo ti Panagadal ti Iraq ti reportna?,"The correct answer is **A: A makasigurado a ti pannakaisardeng ti panagraira ti kinabayolente ket maipakdaar**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Impakdaarna nga **Awan iti makasigurado nga aniaman** iti aramiden idiay Iraq iti daytoy a kanito ket mangpasardeng iti gubat, panagraira iti kinabayolente..."" This directly translates to ""They stated that **nothing is certain** to stop the war, the violence..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Madagdagus a pannakabaliw ti direksion** - The report *did* call for an urgent change in direction (""ipaganetgetna ti madagdagus a pannakabalbaliw ti direksion"").
* **C: Ti pannakausar ti nawaya a debate** - The report began with support for free debate (""nangrugi ti Report nga adda ti pangaasi iti nawaya a debate"").
* **D: Ti pannakaipasdek ti baro a diplomatiko nga inisiatibo** - The report recommended a new diplomatic initiative (""iti umuna kadagiti 78 a rekomendasionna ket ti maysa a baro a diplomatiko nga inisiatibo"").



"
"Segun iti pulis, asinno ti maikonsiderar a makinkannawan nga ima ti Povenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Kinunana ti polis a ni Lo Piccolo ket adda ti nangatngato nga imana ta isuna ti makinkannawan nga ima ti Povezano idiay Palermo..."" (The police stated that Lo Piccolo has a high profile because he is the most prominent figure of the Povezano in Palermo...).

Therefore, according to the police, Lo Piccolo is considered the most prominent figure (makinkannawan nga ima) of the Povezano.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti gapu ti pannakapatay ni Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Napatay isuna bayat ti gubat nga iturturong ni Riina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Niriendaan ni Provenzano dagitoy nga amo idi ginibusanna ti gubat nga iturturong ni Riina a kontra iti estado a nakatayan dagiti kontra iti Mafia a da Giovanni Falcone ken Paolo Borsellino idi 1992."" This directly translates to: ""Provenzano remembered these things when he waged the war directed by Riina against the state, which resulted in the deaths of anti-Mafia figures Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Napatay isuna ti pulis** - The passage doesn't mention police involvement in Falcone's death.
*   **C: Naibaon ni Lo Piccolo a patayen isuna** - Lo Piccolo is mentioned in connection to maintaining a low profile and connections, but not directly to Falcone's murder.
*   **D: Napatay isuna ti padana a krusado ti Mafia a ni Paolo Borsellino** -  While both were killed, the passage states they were victims *of* the war directed by Riina, not that Borsellino killed Falcone.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a pammadayaw ni Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **D: Eksperto ti judo**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Mamindua a Kampeon ti Lubong** - The passage states he was a former World Champion.
*   **B: Nangidaulo ti komite ti Pederasion ti Judo ti Amin a Japan** - The passage explicitly states he led the training committee.
*   **C: Mamindua a medalista ti balitok ti Olympic** - The passage says he won two bronze Olympic medals.
*   **D: Eksperto ti judo** - While it's highly likely he *was* an expert in judo, the passage **doesn't specifically state this**. It describes his accomplishments *as* an expert, but doesn't explicitly call him one.

Therefore, option D is the only one that isn't a direct claim made by the passage."
Sadinno a naliklikan ni Iwasaki ti panagaramidna dagiti kari?,"The correct answer is **A: Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Iwasaki faced problems *during his travels*. The question asks where he *avoided* doing business. The passage lists problems he encountered in Tibet, Nepal, and India, but doesn't mention any issues in Japan. This implies Japan is where he didn't have those travel-related problems and therefore could conduct business normally.



"
Asinno ti nagraut kenni Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti pirata** (The pirates).

The passage states ""Tinakawan isuna dagiti pirata"" which directly translates to ""He was robbed by pirates."" This is the only option that describes someone who *did* something *to* Iwasaki.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti potensial nga asawana** (His potential wife) - The passage says he *lost* his wife, not that she harmed him.
*   **C: Maysa nga aso** (A dog) - The passage says he was *bitten* by a dog, but the question asks who *robbed* him.
*   **D: Pulis** (Police) - The passage does not mention police at all.



"
Kaano nga insardeng ni Alonso ti pakilumbana?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalpasan ti panagsardeng ni Schumacher ti pakilumbana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lineppas ni Michael Schumacher ti pannakilumbana saan a nabayag kalpasan ni Alonso..."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher ended his race shortly after Alonso...""  This directly indicates Alonso stopped racing *after* Schumacher did.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says Schumacher damaged his suspension *after* Alonso stopped, not the other way around.
*   **B:** Fisichella stopped at the very beginning, while Alonso continued for a while.
*   **D:**  The text doesn't specify *when* relative to leading Alonso stopped.



"
Ania ti gapo ti nasapa a pagsardeng ni Schumacher ti pakikarerana iti pay la rugrugina?,"The correct answer is **D: Pannakadadael ti suspension ti lugan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lineppas ni Michael Schumacher ti pannakilumbana saan a nabayag kalpasan ni Alonso, gapu iti **pannakadadael ti suspension iti adu a laban iti kabayatan ti lumba**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naawanan isuna iti kontrol iti luganna** - This describes what happened to Fisichella, not Schumacher.
* **B: Panagdinnungparda ni Alonso** - The passage states Alonso's retirement was *possibly* due to a collision, but doesn't say it *caused* Schumacher's retirement.
* **C: Pannakadadael ti pilid a gapu kenni Fisichella** -  While Fisichella caused an incident, it didn't directly damage Schumacher's car.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti trabaho ti panangisaad ti piansa kadagiti naaresto?","The correct answer is **A: Opisial a nagaresto**.

The text states: ""Nangiyetnag ti komisioner iti piansa, no maited, ken maipormal dagiti darum nga impila ti **opisial a nagaresto**."" This directly indicates that the arresting officer is responsible for filing the bail information.



"
"Segun iti temporary restraining order a nadakamat iti mabasa, ania ti masapul a mapalubosan nga adda kadagiti naaresto tapno napapaut ngem 24 nga oras ti pannakaibaludda?","The correct answer is **A: Piansa**.

Here's why:

The text states that the temporary restraining order requires the setting of bail ""if offered"" and the formal filing of arrest papers by the arresting officer. This is to ensure that those arrested are not held for more than 24 hours without due process – meaning they have the opportunity to post bail and be released.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maysa a miting iti opisial a nagaresto (A meeting with the arresting officer):**  While filing papers *by* the arresting officer is mentioned, a meeting itself isn't the requirement for release.
* **C: Pormal a darum nga inruar ni Judge Glynn (Formal order issued by Judge Glynn):** Judge Glynn issued the restraining order *requiring* things to happen, but the order itself isn't what allows someone to be held longer.
* **D: Ti panagdengngeg (The hearing):** The hearing *sets* the date for a preliminary examination, but doesn't guarantee release or justify holding someone beyond 24 hours.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a rason ti saan a nausar tapno maipalawag ti naikansela a runoff?","The correct answer is **D: Saan unay a nalawag iti konstitusion**.

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats used ""differing interpretations of the Afghanistan constitution"" to argue that a re-run wasn't necessary. This means the reason for cancellation wasn't a clear-cut constitutional rule, but rather a debatable interpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti peggad iti seguridad (Security issues)** - While Lodin *mentioned* security concerns as a reason, the passage highlights the constitutional interpretations as the justification used by diplomats.
*   **B: Maysa a kontradiksion iti konstitusion (A contradiction in the constitution)** - The initial objections claimed cancelling the vote *contradicted* the constitution, not that there was a contradiction *supporting* the cancellation.
*   **C: Nangina a gastos (High costs)** - The passage doesn't mention cost as a factor.



"
Apay a naikeddeng dagiti diplomatiko a saanen a kasapulan ti runoff iti kamaudiananna?,"The correct answer is **C: Adda ti saan unay a nalawag iti konstitusion** (There is ambiguity in the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats *used different interpretations of the Afghan constitution* to argue that a runoff wasn't necessary. This implies the constitution wasn't perfectly clear on the matter, allowing for multiple understandings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nasalungasingna ti konstitusion** (The constitution was violated) - The passage says the diplomats *argued* it wasn't necessary based on the constitution, not that it was a violation.
* **B: Adda dagiti peggad iti seguridad** (There were security issues) -  Security concerns were Lodin's reason for *canceling* the runoff, not the diplomats' reason for believing it wasn't needed.
* **D: Nagastos unay ti eleksion** (The election was too expensive) - The passage doesn't mention cost as a factor.



"
Siasino ti mangipapaay kadagiti serbisio ti hues para ti FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti Ahente ti Politika**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagitoy nga ahente ti responsable para iti pannakaipaay kadagiti serbisio ti gobierno ken hudikatura..."" which translates to ""These agents are responsible for the provision of government and judicial services...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti gobierno ti Pakistan (The Government of Pakistan):** While ultimately the government is responsible, the passage says the *agents* are the ones directly providing the services.
* **C: Presidente ti Pakistan (President of Pakistan):** The President appoints the agents, but doesn't directly provide the services.
* **D: Ti gobierno ti Britania (The British Government):**  The passage discusses post-independence Pakistan, so British rule is no longer relevant.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti “Dagiti Ahente ti Politika” iti FATA ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **C: Sursurutenda ti konstitusion ti Pakistan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Political Agents operate *under* Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.** This implies they are *bound* by it, not that they supersede it. They administer services *through* the Constitution, not outside of it.
* **A: Mangipapaayda kadagiti serbisio ti hues** - The passage explicitly states they are responsible for delivering government and judicial services.
* **B: Napilida ti presidente ti Pakistan** - The passage clearly states the President appoints them.
* **D: Adda ti sibubukel a kontrolda kadagiti partikular a lugar** - The passage indicates they *govern* the FATA areas, implying a high degree of control.

Therefore, the statement that they *overrule* the Constitution is the one that does *not* align with the information provided in the passage.



"
Ania a gunggona ti nakainominaran ni Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalaingan nga Artista**.

The text states: ""Nakaawat da Gosling ken Stone iti nominasion para iti Kalalaingan nga Aktor ken Aktres, kas panagsaganadda."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively.""  ""Kalaingan nga Artista"" means Best Actress.



"
Ania a gunggona ti saan nga nakainominaran ti pelikula?,"The correct answer is **B: Kapintasan kadagiti Visual Effect**.

The passage lists *all* the major categories the movie was nominated for. It specifically mentions nominations for Best Picture, Acting, Directing, Cinematography, etc., and *both* original songs were nominated. It does *not* mention a nomination for Best Visual Effects. Therefore, that is the category the film was not nominated in.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nagtalinaed iti operasion kalpasan ti gingined?,"The correct answer is **D: Maysa a planta ti elektrisidad iti Niigata.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Inreport pay ti NHK a normal ti operasion ti nuklear a planta ti elektrisidad iti Kashiwazaki Kariwa idiay prepektura ti Niigata."" (NHK reported that the operation of the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture was normal).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amin a reactor iti planta ti Hokuriku Shika:** The passage states the reactors at Shika were *stopped* (""naiddep pay laeng"").
*   **B: Ti airport iti Ishikawa:** The passage says Noto Airport was *closed* (""nakaserra pay laeng"").
*   **C: Amin a serbisio ti tren:** The passage says train service was *suspended* (""naisardeng"").



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nadadael gapu ti gingined?","The correct answer is **A: Sumagmamano a balay**.

The text states: ""Naipadamag a dandani 9400 a balbalay iti rehion ket awanan iti danum..."" which translates to ""Around 9400 households in the region were affected and are without water...""  This directly links damage to homes due to the earthquake.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dua a reactor iti planta ti Shika:** The text says the reactors *are still being checked* (""Naiddep pay laeng"") – not that they are damaged.
* **C: Sumagmamano a kalsada:** The text states roads are damaged (""Sumagmamano a kalsada ti nadadael"") but doesn't directly attribute this to the earthquake itself, just that they *are* damaged.
* **D: Ti Noto Airport:** The text says the airport *is still closed* (""nakaserra pay laeng"") - not damaged.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a parikut ti saan a nairaman iti dokumento?","The correct answer is **B: Ti gapu ti gubat idi 1967** (The reason for the 1967 war).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *outcome* of the 1967 war (borders before it) and current negotiations based on that.** It doesn't discuss *why* the war happened.
* **A: Ti masakbayan ti Jerusalem** (The status of Jerusalem) - This is explicitly mentioned as a contested issue (""masanguanan nga estado iti Jerusalem"").
* **C: Ti kaadda ti militar iti napatad a daga** (The military presence in the disputed land) - The passage details disagreements over the length of Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley.
* **D: Ti pakaseknan kadagiti nagbeddengan** (Negotiations over the borders) - The entire document revolves around basing borders on those before the 1967 war.

Therefore, the only topic *not* discussed in the passage is the cause of the 1967 war.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a dawat ti Palestina?,"The correct answer is **B: Agdama a kaadda dagiti militar iti Jordan Valley**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Palestinians want a **five-year** military presence in the Jordan Valley, while Israel is offering **ten years**. This means they *do not* accept the current (longer) military presence as proposed by Israel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti nagbeddengan a base kadagiti kondision sakbay ti gubat** - The document states the Palestinians *want* borders based on pre-1967 conditions.
*   **C: Dagiti sungbat a maipapan ti masakbayan ti Jerusalem** - The passage mentions Jerusalem being a key issue, implying negotiation is happening, not outright rejection.
*   **D: Ti kaddaa ti militar iti lima a tawen iti Jordan Valley** - This is precisely what the Palestinians *want* and are proposing.



"
Ania a pagilian ti nagadalan ni Ma ti kalintegan?,"The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos ti Amerika**.

Here's why:

The text states ""nagadal ni Ma iti New York University ken Harvard Law School"". Both New York University and Harvard Law School are located in the United States of America.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti panangsuporta para ti ania a pagilian ti nangabakan ni Ma iti eleksion?","The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos ti Amerika**.

The text states that Ma had a ""green card"" as a permanent resident of the US and campaigned on a platform of resisting closer ties with Mainland China. This clearly indicates support for the US (through his residency) and opposition to China.



"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, siasino ti nagtrabahuan ni Carolyn Wilson sakbay a pimmanaw isuna iti ili?","The correct answer is **C: Ti OHA**.

The text states that Carolyn Wilson *ti OHA* (of OHA) took the security deposits. This indicates she was employed by or associated with the OHA.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: East Bay Community Law Center:** The East Bay Community Law Center is where the families *went for help*, not where Carolyn Wilson worked.
* **B: Pulis ti Oakland:** The police are investigating the situation, but the text doesn't say Carolyn Wilson worked for them.
* **D: Lockwood Gardens:** Lockwood Gardens is the housing complex where the families live, not Carolyn Wilson's employer.



"
"Manipud ti uppat a karera a nagtalinaed iti season, siasino ti maika-uppat iti Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ni Hamlin ket maat-atiw iti duapulo a puntos, ngem mangabngabak ti lima kenni Bowyer."" This means Hamlin is 10 points ahead of Bowyer. Since Hamlin is in 3rd place, Bowyer must be in 4th.

Let's break it down:

*   **1st:** Keselowsky
*   **2nd:** Johnson
*   **3rd:** Hamlin
*   **4th:** Bowyer (Hamlin is 10 points ahead of him)
*   **5th:** Kahne
*   **6th:** Truex, Jr.



"
"Kas kasaruno ti karera a naisaad iti mabasa, mano ti puntos ni Kahne iti Driver’s Championship?","The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The passage states: ""Ni Kahne ken Truex, Jr. ket maikalima ken maikainnem nga addaan ti 2,200 ken 2,207 a puntos.""  It specifically says Kahne has 2,207 points.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: 2220** - This number doesn't appear in the text.
*   **B: 2250** - This is Keselowsky's point total.
*   **C: 2243** - This is Johnson's point total.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, mano a daras a nasaksian dagiti tattao ti panagtinnag dagiti meteorite a nangpaneknek a manipud daytoy iti Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Lima a daras**.

The text states: ""Daytoy ket mapatpati nga iti **maikalima a daras** iti pakasarsaritaan a dagiti tao ket nagobserba iti maparparawar a nakompirmaran iti kemikal a materyal a naggapo iti Mars a naregreg iti Lubong."" 

This translates to: ""It is believed to be the **fifth time** in history that people have observed a fireball confirmed to be chemical material from Mars that fell to Earth.""



"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti agpaypayso maipapan kadagiti bato a naammuan a manipud iti Mars?","The correct answer is **D: 34 dagitoy**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Manipud iti agarup a 24,000 nga am-ammo a layap a natinnag iti Daga, 34 laeng ti napaneknekan a naggapu idiay Mars."" This directly answers the question of how many rocks are known to be from Mars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nasarakan amin dagitoy bayat ti panagtudo ti meteor idi Hulio** - While some were found in July, the passage doesn't say *all* were found then.
*   **B: 24,000 dagitoy** - This is the total number of meteorites found on Earth, not just those from Mars.
*   **C: Nanginnginada ti $11,000 ngem ti balitok** - This refers to the *price* of the rocks, not the quantity found.



"
Kaano a nagretiro ni Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **B: Kalpasan ti maikapito a pangabakna iti kampeonato**.

The passage states: ""Ni Schumacher a nagretiro idi 2006 kalpasanna a nangabak iti kampeonato iti Formula 1 iti maminpito nga ulit..."" (Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship seven times...).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Felipe Massa's accident happened *after* Schumacher retired.
*   **C:** The passage mentions Schumacher being a rival to Massa, not being surpassed by him.
*   **D:** Schumacher retired in 2006, not during the 2009 season.



"
Kaano a nadunor ni Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: Bayat iti Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Nagsagaba ti Brazilian [Felipe Massa] iti nakaro a pannakadunor ti ulona kalpasan ti maysa a crash kabayatan ti Hungarian Grand Prix idi 2009."" This directly translates to ""The Brazilian [Felipe Massa] suffered a serious head injury after a crash during the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.""  The Hungarian Grand Prix is a specific race within the Formula 1 season – therefore it happened *during* a Grand Prix.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasanonto a maapektaran ti pannakaiyurnos iti AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Ti bilang dagiti mangus-usar ti AOL ket maisuppiatto kadagiti mangus-usar ti Yahoo ken Microsoft**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti bilang dagiti nagtipon nga agus-usar kadagiti serbisio ti Yahoo! ken Microsoft ket karibalenna ti bilang dagiti kostumer ti AOL.""  This directly translates to ""The combined number of users of Yahoo! and Microsoft services is comparable to the number of AOL customers."" This means AOL's user base is *similar* to the combined user base of its competitors, implying it could be overshadowed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti bilang dagiti mangus-usar ti AOL ket umadunto** - The passage discusses potential decline, not an increase.
* **B: Ti AOL laeng ti kompania a nasukog iti merkado ti IM** - The passage clearly mentions Yahoo! and Microsoft as competitors.
* **D: Saanto a mausar ti AOL iti Estados Unidos** - The passage states AOL is declining in *use* in the US, not that it isn't *used* at all.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mabalin a mangleppas iti baro a napagtulagan?,"The correct answer is **D: Panagkadua iti Yahoo ken Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft is comparable to AOL's customer base. This implies that Yahoo! and Microsoft represent a significant competitive force. If AOL tries to dominate the IM market through its own growth, it will likely face challenges (""gibusen a kinawaya"") *because* of the competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti nawaras a panagdur-as ti internet iti Estados Unidos (The declining internet access in the United States):** While mentioned, this doesn't directly relate to what would challenge AOL's attempt at dominance.
* **B: Ti panagusar ti merkado ti IM (The use of the IM market):**  The passage is *about* the IM market, not something that would challenge AOL.
* **C: Ti kinawaya ti AOL a mangsukog ti merkado iti bukodna a panagaddang (AOL's freedom to conquer the market on its own):** This describes AOL's *attempt*, not what would *prevent* it.



"
Mano a tao ti natay iti panangraut a saan a pulis?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

The text states that *two* police officers died. It also states that 19 of the injured were police officers. This implies the remaining injured people were *not* police officers. However, the question asks how many *non-police* people died. The text doesn't mention any deaths among civilians or non-police personnel. Therefore, the answer is zero.



"
Siasino ti nangipadamag iti suspek ti panangraut?,"The correct answer is **A: Pulis**.

The text states: ""Imbaga dagiti polis a pagsuspetsaanda ti maysa a napabasol a militante a Daesh (ISIL) a responsable iti atake."" (The police say they suspect a Daesh (ISIL) militant is responsible for the attack.) This directly indicates the police are the ones pointing the finger at the suspect.



"
"Gapu ti kasasaad ti Florida kas maysa a winner-takes-all nga estado, ania ti naigunggona ken ni Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Amin a delegado ti estado**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""inted ti Florida iti amin a limapulo a delegadona kenni Romney"".  Because Florida is a ""winner-takes-all"" state, Romney received *all* of Florida's delegates by winning the primary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 kadagiti delegado ti estado** - This is the number of votes Newt Gingrich received, not what Romney won.
*   **B: Ti nominasion ti Republican a Partido** - Winning Florida put Romney in a stronger position, but doesn't guarantee the nomination yet. It makes him the ""front-runner.""
*   **D: 46 porsiento ti butos** - This is the *percentage* of votes Romney received, not the tangible benefit of winning.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti porsiento ti butos para ken ni Gingrich iti immuna nga eleksion?","The correct answer is **B: 32 porsiento**.

The passage clearly states: ""Diay dati nga U. S Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich ket maikadua nga addaan iti 32 porsiento."" (The former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was second with 32 percent.)"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti saan a nagtuloy a timmaray kalpasan dagiti resulta ti panagtataripnong?","The correct answer is **B: Ni Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ni Bachman, a nangabak iti Ames Straw Poll, inkeddengna a palpasenna ti kampaniana."" (Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll, decided to suspend her campaign.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ni Gingrich:** The text says Gingrich praised Santorum and was critical of Romney, but didn't suspend his campaign.
*   **C: Ni Perry:** Perry initially considered dropping out but then decided to continue and compete in the South Carolina primary.
*   **D: Ni Romney:** Romney is mentioned as being targeted by negative ads, but there's no indication he suspended his campaign.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nangdayaw ti sabali a kandidato kalpasan ti resulta ti caucus?","The correct answer is **B: Ni Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Kalpasan a rimuar dagiti resulta, dinayaw ni Gingrich ni Santorum..."" This translates to ""After the results came out, Gingrich praised Santorum...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ni Bachmann** - The text says she decided to continue her campaign, not that she praised another candidate.
*   **C: Ni Romney** - The text says Gingrich was critical of Romney for negative ads, not that Romney praised someone.
*   **D: Ni Perry** - The text says he was reassessing his campaign, not that he praised someone.



"
Sadinno ti kakaisuna a lugar a nai-feature ti pabuya sakbay ti 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""In its early days, the show only aired on long-standing internet radio station TogiNet Radio..."" This means TogiNet Radio was the *only* place the show was featured before 2015.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: East Texas** - While the actors were *from* East Texas, the show wasn't broadcast *in* East Texas specifically, but on an internet radio station.
* **C: AstroNet Radio** - AstroNet Radio was created *in* 2015, not before.
* **D: Dagiti lokal nga istasion ti radio** - The passage explicitly says it aired on an *internet* radio station, not local radio stations.



"
Ti istasion ket mangilad-ladawan ti pabuya kas ania a tipo ti spin?,"The correct answer is **C: Old school**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes the show as a ""daan nga eskwelaan a teatro ti radio"" which translates to ""old school radio theater.""  This is the most direct description of the show's style.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Amateur:** While the actors are local, the description doesn't focus on a lack of professional quality.
*   **B: Geeky:**  There's nothing in the text to suggest the show has a specifically ""geeky"" theme or target audience.
*   **D: Lokal:** While the actors *are* local, the primary descriptor is the style of the show, not its origin. The ""lokal"" aspect is a detail *about* how it's made, not what it *is*.



"
Ania ti natipun ni David Headley a nakatulong ti panangraut ti militante a grupo iti kamaudiananna?,"The correct answer is **A: Impormasion**.

The passage specifically states that David Headley helped with ""panagalana ken panagsawarna kadagiti impormasion"" (planning and providing information) that allowed the operation to be carried out.  The other options are *tools* used in the attack, but Headley's contribution was the *information* that enabled the attack to happen.



"
Ania a klase ti transportasion ti inusar ti militante a grupo tapno makabiahe paapan iti Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bangka**.

The text explicitly states: ""dimteng dagiti nangraut iti Mumbai babaen ti **bangka** nga adda dagiti awitda a granada..."" (attackers arrived in Mumbai **by boat** with their grenades...).



"
Ania a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti nagbanagan ti Silulukat a laban ti Nadal ken Raonic Brisbane a naisaad iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **A: Naabak ti Raonic iti Nadal** (Raonic lost to Nadal).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Saan pay a nabayag idi naabak isuna kontra ken ni Raonic iti Brisbane Open."" (Recently, he lost against Raonic in the Brisbane Open.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Addaan ti 88% a puntos ti net iti Raonic** (Raonic had 88% net points) - The passage states Nadal had 88% net points, not Raonic.
*   **C: Naabak ti Nadal iti Raonic** (Nadal lost to Raonic) - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
*   **D: Nakapuntos ti Raonic ti 76 a puntos** (Raonic scored 76 points) - The passage states Nadal scored 76 points on his first serve, not Raonic overall.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti agdama a laban ti Nadal ken Raonic kalpasan ti umuna a serve?","The correct answer is **B: Nangabak ti Nadal ti 76 a puntos**.

The passage specifically states: ""Naala ni Nadal ti 88% a puntos iti ay-ayam a nangabakanna ti 76 a puntos ti umuna a panag-serve."" This directly answers the question about Nadal's performance after the first serve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Addaan ti 88% a puntos ti net iti Raonic** - The passage talks about Nadal's points, not Raonic's.
*   **C: Ti puntos ket 7-2** - This is Nadal's overall record *against* Canadians, not the specific details of this match.
*   **D: Naabak ti Raonic iti Nadal** - While implied, the question asks for a *statistic* from the passage, not a general outcome.



"
Ania a programa ti pagsasao ti saan a nairaman iti tallo a baro a pagiwarnakan ti Naked News?,"The correct answer is **A: Italiano**.

Here's why:

The text states Naked News already reports in English and Japanese, and is *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean broadcasts. The question asks which language is *not* included in the *three new* broadcasts.  Italian is one of the three new languages being added, so it's not the answer. However, since the question specifically asks for which language is *not* in the three *new* broadcasts, we need to look for a language that they *already* report in. 

The text explicitly states they currently report in English and Japanese. Since the question asks for languages *not* in the *new* broadcasts, the answer must be one they currently use. Thus, the answer is **Italian**, as it is one of the new languages added.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a saan a sidadaan ti baro a pagiwarnakan ti Naked News?","The correct answer is **A: Kadagiti cellphone**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News is distributing its broadcasts ""iti web, ken alikamen a mobile"" (on the web, and also on mobile).  ""Alikamen a mobile"" specifically refers to mobile phones/cellphones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti Internet:** While they *are* on the internet, the passage specifically highlights mobile phones *in addition* to the internet.
* **C: Kadagiti teatro:** The passage does not mention theaters.
* **D: Telebision:**  The passage mentions television, but also states they are expanding beyond just that.



"
Mano ti saan a nakalpas ti Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""ken 45 iti 117 a dagup nga agis-ski iti Giant Slalom ti saan a nakaranggo iti lumba."" This directly translates to ""and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom did not finish the race.""
"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw kadagiti resulta dagiti karera iti Kampeonato?,"The correct answer is **B: 45 nga skier ti saan a nakalpas ti panagtarayda iti Giant Slalom**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ken 45 iti 117 a dagup nga agis-ski iti Giant Slalom ti saan a nakaranggo iti lumba."" (and 45 of the 117 total skiers in Giant Slalom did not finish the race).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti maikadua a karera, immuna a nalpas ni Carpenado sakbay ti maysa nga skier manipud ti Hungary** - The passage states Carpenado finished *tenth* in the Giant Slalom and makes no mention of finishing before a Hungarian skier.
* **C: Ad-adu nga skier ti nakalpas iti Giant Slalom ngem ti Slalom** - The passage states 116 skiers started the Slalom and 117 started the Giant Slalom. It only says how many *didn't finish* each race (36 and 45 respectively).  We don't know how many finished each race.
* **D: Maikasangapulo a nalpas ti Carpenado iti Slalom** - The passage says Carpenado did *not finish* the Slalom (""Saan a Nalpas"").



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangikeddengan ti NBA nga isuspende?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti season ti basketball**

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ti NBA ket impasardengna ti tawen a liga ti basketballna"" (The NBA suspended its annual basketball league). This directly indicates that the entire basketball season was suspended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maysa a player manipud ti Utah Jazz** - While a player from the Utah Jazz *triggered* the suspension, the suspension wasn't *of* the player.
* **C: Asino man a player a nagpositibo iti COVID-19** - The suspension was a preventative measure for the whole league, not just targeting any player who tested positive.
* **D: Ti grupo ti basketball a Utah Jazz** -  The suspension affected the entire league, not just the Utah Jazz team.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti gapu kadagiti pakaseknan ti NBA maipapan ti virus?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a player ti Utah Jazz a nagpositibo.**

The passage directly states: ""Ti desision ti NBA ket makagapu ta ti maysa kadagiti basketbolista ti Utah Jazz ket nagpositibo ti Covid-19 virus."" (The NBA's decision was caused by the fact that one of the Utah Jazz basketball players tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti miembro ti NBA a nagpositibo** - The passage only mentions *one* player initially.
*   **B: Sumagmamano a player a nagpositibo iti ay-ayam ti Utah Jazz** - The passage doesn’t specify how many players, just one.
*   **C: Maysa a player ti Utah Jazz a saan a nagay-ayam ti kusto kalpasan ti panagpositibona** - The passage does not mention anything about the player's condition after testing positive.



"
Siasino ti nakapuntos ti makapangabak a goal iti ay-ayam para ti Washington Capitals maisuppiat ti Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Ni Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""Ti umuna a panangasister ni Ovechkin iti dayta a rabii ket isu ti makapangabak a goal ti agdadamo a ni Niklas Backstrom;"" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist of the night was the game-winning goal by Niklas Backstrom.""



"
Siasino ti nakapuntos ti maika-60 a goal ti season bayat ti ay-ayam ti Capitals a maisuppiat ti Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ti maikadua a puntosna iti dayta a rabii ket isu ti maika-60-na iti season..."" referring to Ovechkin.  It then explains he was the first to reach 60 points in a season since Jagr and Lemieux did in 1995-96.



"
Kaano a kasapulan ti bangko a Northern Rock ti suporta manipud ti gobierno?,"The correct answer is **D: Bayat ti krisis iti mortgage**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti Northern Rock ket nagkasapulan ti suporta gapu ti pannakaiparangna kabayatan ti krisis ti upa idi 2007."" (Northern Rock needed support because of its exposure during the 2007 mortgage crisis.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kalpasan a napagbalin a nasional ti bangko** - The bank *became* nationalized *after* needing support, not the other way around.
*   **B: Idi summina ti bangko manipud ti kompania iti panangimaton ti tagikua** - This refers to the company seeking support, but doesn't explain *why* they needed it.
*   **C: Kalpasan a nagatang ti grupo ti Virgin ti bangko** - Virgin attempted to buy the bank *after* it was already in trouble, and their offer was rejected before nationalization.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti transaksion ti Grupo ti Virgin iti bangko a Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: Ginatang ti Grupo ti Virgin ti bangko kalpasan ti panagbalinna a nasional.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ginatang laeng ti Virgin ti “nasayaat a banko” ti Northern Rock, saan a ti kompania a mangmanmanehar iti sansanikua."" This means Virgin *did* buy part of Northern Rock, but only *after* it was nationalized and split into ""good"" and ""bad"" banks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say Virgin bought the company managing the bad assets. It specifies they only bought the ""good bank.""
*   **C:** Virgin made an offer *before* the nationalization, not to provide emergency support during the mortgage crisis.
*   **D:** The passage says the offer was *not* accepted before nationalization, and they only bought part of the bank *after* it was nationalized.



"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, ania a pagilian ti naapektaran ti panagpirma ti climate accord iti Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos**.

The passage explicitly states that Mr. Rudd's decision to permanently sign the Kyoto climate accord *distinguishes Australia from the United States*. This means the US is the country directly affected by Australia's decision to participate while the US did not.



"
Kinuna ti sigud a gobierno ti Australia a ti ratification ti Kyoto ket makadadael ti ania?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti ekonomia ti pagilian**.

The passage explicitly states: ""madi a pinasingked ti sigud a konserbatibo a gobierno ti Australia ti Kyoto, ibagada a **madadaelna ti ekonomiana** gapuna ti kinadagsen ti pagpannurayda ti paglaklako ti karbon..."" 

This directly answers the question of what the previous Australian government believed would be harmed by ratifying Kyoto.



"
Ania a programa ti nakare na-trail recruit dagiti shooter?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti programa ti panaganup ti Sporting Shooters Association**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...dagiti kwalipikado a boluntario ket naayaban, babaen iti programa ti panaganup iti Asosasion ti Pang-isports nga Agpalpaltog."" This directly indicates that the Sporting Shooters Association's conservation program was used to recruit the shooters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti Sporting Shooters Association ti programa iti Australia** - While true that the association *has* programs, this isn't the *specific* program used for recruitment.
*   **B: Ti programa ti Park Conservation and Heritage** - This is a department within NPWS, but doesn't recruit the shooters directly.
*   **C: Ti programa ti NPWS** - NPWS works *with* the association, but the recruitment is done *through* the association's program.



"
Ania a keddeng ti saan nga agpaypayso a manganninaw ti panagipadas a panagkontrol iti peste?,"The correct answer is **A: Gapu ta daytoy ti umuna a panagpadas ti programa, saan a natingiting daytoy.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the rangers will closely monitor the initial pest control shooting operation *because* it's the first of the program. This implies a cautious approach and a need to assess its effectiveness before scaling up.  The question asks why the shooting would be closely monitored, and option A directly addresses that reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti pumapaltog ket nakaawat ti instruksion ti panagensayo** - While true, this doesn't explain *why* the shooting is being closely monitored. It just describes the preparation.
*   **C: Dagiti pumapaltog ket kitkitaen a nalaing dagiti ranger** - This is a result of the monitoring, not the reason for it.
*   **D: Uppat a pumapaltog ti napili** - This is a factual statement but doesn't answer the ""why"" question.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a nabirukan ti bisak?","The correct answer is **D: Iti Ethiopia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ti manangsirarak idiay Rift Valley Research Service **iti Ethiopia**..."" (the researcher at the Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia**...) This directly answers the question of where the bisak was found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti Rift Valley:** While the research service is *in* the Rift Valley, the passage specifically mentions Ethiopia as the location.
* **B: Iti maysa a fossil:** The passage discusses a fossil, but the bisak wasn't *found in* a fossil, it's related to the study *of* a fossil.
* **C: Iti ebidensia a molekular:** The passage contrasts the bisak's age with molecular evidence, it wasn't found *in* that evidence.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti napasamak a nasapsapa ngem ti manamnama?","The correct answer is **A: Ti pannakatakuat ti fossil** (The age of the fossil).

Here's why:

The passage states the fossil is ""nasapsapa ngem iti ibaga ti ebidensia a molekular"" – meaning it's *older* than what molecular evidence suggests.  This refers to the fossil's age being determined to be earlier than expected based on genetic studies (molecular evidence).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti split** - The passage doesn't mention a ""split"" specifically.
* **C: Ti panangkedngan ti molecular nga ebidensia** - The passage states the fossil is *older* than the molecular evidence, not that the evidence itself happened sooner than expected.
* **D: Ti panagsukisok iti Rift Valley** -  The Rift Valley is the location of the research, not what happened unexpectedly.



"
Ania ti kasapulan nga aramiden ti player tapno ma-manipular dagiti garaw bayat ti video game?,"The correct answer is **D: Iyakar ti controller iti angin**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller uses sensors and allows players to control actions ""by waving the controller in the air."" This directly corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Siguradoen a dagiti sensor ti controller ket nakaposision nga asideg iti console** - The passage says the sensors are near the *television*, not the console.
*   **B: I-traingulate ti posisionda** - While triangulation is likely *how* the system works, the passage doesn't say the *player* needs to do that.
*   **C: Ikabil dagiti sensor asideg iti telebision** - This is mentioned in the passage but isn't what the *player* does to manipulate the game. It's a setup step.



"
Ania ti nadisenio a kasla remote ti telebision?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti controller ti Nintendo Revolution**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kas met leng iti remote ti telebision, ti kontroler ket agusar..."" (Just like a television remote, the controller uses...). This directly links the design *to* the controller. The passage is describing the *controller* as being designed like a TV remote.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti dua a sensor ti controller** - While the sensors are *part* of the controller, they aren't the entire thing being designed like a remote.
*   **C: Ti presentasion iti keynote** - This refers to the event where it was shown, not something being designed.
*   **D: Ti console ti Nintendo Revolution** - The passage is talking about the controller, not the console itself.



"
Ania ti saan a naisaad iti kabaruan a padamag manipud ti ahensia ti damag iti Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Naglanding ti eroplano iti Ürümqi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the plane *avoided* a forced landing in Ürümqi.** This means it did *not* land there. The other options are all directly stated in the passage:
    * **A:** ""Nakaawat iti pangta ti bomba ti eroplano"" (The plane received a bomb threat) - explicitly stated.
    * **C:** ""nagsubli iti Afghanistan"" (returned to Afghanistan) - explicitly stated.
    * **D:** ""bimmaba iti Kandahar"" (landed in Kandahar) - explicitly stated.



"
Ania ti saan a naisaad iti baro a kaunaan a padamag ti ahensia ti damag iti Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti eroplano ket napagkeddengan iti emerhensia a panaglanding** (The plane made an emergency landing).

Here's why:

The passage states the plane *returned* to Afghanistan after attempting a forced landing in Urumqi. It doesn't explicitly state it *made* an emergency landing, only that they *attempted* a forced one. The other options are all directly stated in the passage:

*   **A: Na-hijack ti eroplano** (The plane was hijacked) - directly stated.
*   **C: Ti eroplano ket nagsubli iti Afghanistan** (The plane returned to Afghanistan) - directly stated.
*   **D: Nakaawat ti bomb threat ti eroplano** (The plane received a bomb threat) - directly stated.



"
Ania ti inbaga ni Sara Danius bayat ti programana iti radio?,"The correct answer is **D: Isardeng ton ti komite dagiti aramid a mangkontak ken ni Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Kinuna ni Danius, “Awan ti ar-aramidenmi ita. Immawagak ken nagpaw-itak iti email iti kaasitgan a kaduana ket nakaawatak iti nasasayaat a sungbat. Ita, umanay daydiayen.”""  This translates to ""Danius said, “We have nothing to do now. I called and sent an email to his closest colleague and received a good response. Now, that’s that.”"" 

This clearly indicates they've contacted Dylan and received a response, meaning they're *stopping* their efforts to contact him. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti nangabak ti Nobel Prize iti Literatura** (The winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature) - The passage is *about* the winner, but doesn't state what Danius said *about* the winner.
*   **B: Ti komite ket saan a nakaawat ti sungbat manipud kadagiti collaborator** (The committee did not receive a response from collaborators) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage states.
*   **C: Dagiti nainominar iti 2016 para ti Nobel Prize iti Literatura** (Those nominated in 2016 for the Nobel Prize in Literature) - The passage doesn't mention nominations.



"
Siasino ti saan a madanon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti asideg a collaborator ni Bob Dylan** (Bob Dylan's closest collaborator).

Here's why:

The passage states Sara Danius *did* reach out to ""kaasitgan a kaduana"" (closest associate) of Bob Dylan via email and *received* a response.  Therefore, they *were* reached. The question asks who was *not* reached.  The other options were all involved in the process:

* **B: Ni Sara Danius** - She *did* the reaching out.
* **C: Ti Swedish Academy** - Danius represents the Swedish Academy.
* **D: Ni Bob Dylan** - While not directly contacted initially, his close collaborator *was* contacted and responded.



"
Siasino ti nagkomento iti kari kas “maysa a napateg nga addang”?,"The correct answer is **C: Ni Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states that Gordon Johndroe, Bush's spokesperson, called the move ""a significant step."" The question asks who commented on the move as ""a significant step."""
Mano nga stamp ti naala ni Slania manipud kadagiti agduduma a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **A: Nasurok 2,000**.

Here's why:

The text states Slania created ""more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other nations.""  ""More than 1,000"" plus 28 nations implies a total exceeding 2,000.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 1,000** - This only accounts for the stamps for Sweden, not the additional 28 nations.
*   **C: Dandani 2,000** - While close, the text specifies *more than* 1,000, suggesting a higher number.
*   **D: Nasurok 1,000** - This is too vague and doesn't account for the stamps from other countries."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a gapu ti agtul-tuloy a panagtedted manipud kadagiti tank vent?","The correct answer is **A: Ti sekundaria a containment a lugar a napno agingga ti kapasidadna** (The secondary containment area is full to capacity).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agingga idi malem iti Miyerkules, agtagtagas latta iti tangke mabalin nga gapo iti panagbellad gapo iti kabara iti uneg ti tangke."" This means the leak continues *because* the tank is full and there's nowhere for the excess to go. The secondary containment area (the ""pad"" capable of holding 55,000 barrels) is also full.  Therefore, the continued venting is likely due to the tank being overfull because of the leak and the containment area being at capacity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maysa a rutina nga eksamen para ti fire-command a sistema** (A routine examination of the fire-command system) - The fire-command system *caused* the initial leak, it doesn't explain the continued venting.
* **C: Thermal a panaglawa** (Thermal expansion) - The passage doesn't mention anything about temperature or thermal expansion.
* **D: Uram iti maysa kadagiti pump station ti Fort Greely** (Damage at one of the Fort Greely pump stations) - The problem is with the tank itself and the containment area, not a pump station.



"
Apay a naglukat dagiti relied valves?,"The correct answer is **B: Adda pannakapukaw ti koriente kalpasan ti system test** (There was a power outage after a system test).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ti panagawan ti koriente kalpasan ti gagangay a pannakaipadas ti sistema ti fire-command ti nakaigapu iti pannakalukat dagiti balbula ti pangtimon...""  This directly links the valve opening to a power outage following a system test.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Adda ti thermal a panaglawa iti uneg ti tangke** (There is a thermal expansion inside the tank) - The passage doesn't mention thermal expansion.
*   **C: Naan-anay ti kapasidad dagiti tangke** (The tanks were over capacity) - While the tanks have capacity, the issue isn't *over* capacity causing the valves to open, but a failure leading to the release of oil.
*   **D: Ti sekundaria a containment a lugar ket saan a makalaon kadagiti naan-anay a bariles** (The secondary containment area is not large enough for the excess barrels) - This describes a potential consequence of the spill, not the *cause* of the valves opening.



"
"Ita, kasano kangato ti danum iti The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: 20 a kadapan**.

The passage states, ""Ti Ninth a Ward, a nalayus iti agingga iti kangato a **20 kadapan** kabayatan ti Hurricane Katrina..."" (The Ninth Ward, which was flooded to a height of **20 feet** during Hurricane Katrina...).

Therefore, the height of the water in The Ninth Ward was 20 feet."
"Bayat ti Bagyo a Katrina, ania ti napasamak iti The Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Ti danum ti layos ket 20 a kadapan ti kangatona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti Ninth a Ward, a nalayus iti agingga iti kangato a 20 kadapan kabayatan ti Hurricane Katrina..."" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, which was flooded to a depth of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti danum ti layos ket 100 a kadapan ti kalawana** - While the levee breach was 100 feet wide, this doesn't describe the *depth* of the flooding in the Ninth Ward.
*   **B: Nangat-ngato ti inggana siket a danum iti penned** - ""Siket"" means shallow. The passage states the flooding was up to 20 *feet* deep, not shallow.
*   **D: 6 a pulgada ti danum manipud ti tudo ti nangperdi iti penned** - The 6 inches refers to the estimated settlement of the levee, not the depth of the flooding.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kinumpirma ti Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **A: No sadinno a nagbiahe ti pasiente**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the patient *came from* Nigeria.** This directly implies travel. Hamilton confirmed the patient was admitted and came from Nigeria.  Therefore, it was *not* confirmed that the patient did not travel.

Let's look at why the other options are confirmed by the passage:

* **B: Ti posibilidad a naala ti dadduma a pasiente ti virus** - The passage mentions ""ayanna dagiti dadduma a kaso iti Ebola virus ket napasamak,"" confirming the possibility of other cases.
* **C: No nasurot ti kusto a protokol** - The passage states ""Sinurot ti ospital dagiti paglintegan tapno makontrol ti impeksion,"" confirming the protocols were followed.
* **D: Ti agdama a kondision ti pasiente** - The passage says ""Kinompirma ni Hamilton a naawat iti Howard University Hospital ti pasiente a nasayaat ti kasasaad daytoy,"" confirming the patient's stable condition.



"
Ania ti maysa a banag a kayat a maammuan dagiti sientista?,"The correct answer is **D: Kasano a nabuo ti Lubong**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Mangnamnama dagiti sientista a maawatanda no kasano a nabukel dagiti planeta, nangruna no kasano a nabukel ti Daga..."" (Scientists hope to understand how planets were formed, especially how Earth was formed...).  This directly addresses what the scientists want to know.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No madungpar dagiti comet ti Lubong** - While the passage *mentions* comets impacting Earth, it's presented as evidence *related to* understanding Earth's formation, not the primary question itself.
* **B: Kasano a mabubuo dagiti protina** - The passage mentions proteins as something organic matter *can* form, but doesn't state scientists are actively trying to understand protein formation.
* **C: Ania ti organic matter** -  The passage mentions organic matter, but it's in the context of its role in potentially supporting life, not as a central question scientists are investigating.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti amad ti lokal a pulis iti closure?","The correct answer is **C: Insuroda kadagiti motorista dagiti sabali a ruta**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""nausar met ti tulong ti 80 a polis iti pannakaiturong dagiti motorista kadagiti detour."" This directly translates to ""80 police officers helped to direct motorists to detours.""  Detours are alternative routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inkalikagumda iti FBI nga aramiden ti closure:** While the closure happened *because of* FBI pressure, the police didn't ""comply"" by doing the closure itself, the Maryland Transportation Authority did.
*   **B: Inkeddengda nga aramiden ti closure:**  The police didn't *decide* to close anything; they assisted with the closure ordered by the Maryland Transportation Authority.
*   **D: Inpadamagda dagiti pannakaitantan ti trapiko iti alternatibo a ruta:** The passage says there were *no* reported accidents on the alternative route (beltway), so they didn't mitigate traffic incidents there.



"
Ania ti napasamak kadagiti pagserrekan a tubo bayat ti closure?,"The correct answer is **A: Naserraan ida**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nausar dagiti dump truck a pangserra kadagiti pagserkan ti tubo..."" which translates to ""Dump trucks were used to close the toll plazas..."" 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nausarda kas detour:** The toll plazas weren't *used* as detours; they were *closed* and motorists were directed *around* them via detours.
* **C: Nakalukatda para kadagiti motorista:** The passage clearly states they were *closed* (naserraan).
* **D: Adda ti nabuntog a panaggaraw ti trapiko:** While there was heavy traffic on the beltway (the alternative route), the question specifically asks about the toll plazas themselves, not the surrounding traffic.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a napasamak sakbay a nadungpar ti lugan ti retratista?","The correct answer is **C: Nangala ti retrista kadagiti ladawan ti police stop**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""iti maysa a waragawag, kinuna ni Bieber a “[n]upay awanak wenno saanak a direkta a nairaman iti daytoy a nakaladladingit nga aksidente, ipeksak ti pannakipagriknak ken karkararagko iti pamilia ti biktima.” Ti website iti panglinglingayan a padpadamag a TMZ ket naawatanna a ti retratista ket nagsardeng iti bangir nga igid iti Sepulveda Boulevard ken pinadasna a mangala iti ladawan dagiti pulis a nagsardeng sakbay a dimmaliasat iti kalsada ken nagtultuloy...""

This directly translates to: ""In a statement, Bieber said “[e]ven though I was not and am not directly involved in this tragic accident, I extend my condolences to the family of the victim.” The celebrity gossip website TMZ reported that the photographer was stopped on the shoulder of Sepulveda Boulevard and began to take pictures of the police stop before pulling back onto the road and continuing, directing California Highway Patrol officers to traffic to signal him to pull over.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti retratista ket inbilin ti Highway Patrol nga agsubli iti dalan** - The text states the Highway Patrol *tried* to signal him to pull over *after* he pulled back onto the road, not before.
*   **B: Ti retrista ket nagparada ti luganna iti Sepulveda Boulevard** - While he stopped on Sepulveda Boulevard, the text doesn't say he *parked* there. It says he stopped on the shoulder.
*   **D: Ti retrista ket nakaala ti ladawan ni Bieber** - The text doesn't mention anything about the photographer taking pictures of Bieber.



"
Ania ti padpadasen nga aramiden ti retrista sakbay a nadungpar isuna ti lugan?,"The correct answer is **B: Mangala kadagiti ladawan ti police stop** (Taking pictures of a police stop).

The passage states: ""the photographer had stopped on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard and was taking pictures of police who had pulled someone over before being hit by a vehicle."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agparada iti Sepulveda Boulevard** (Parking on Sepulveda Boulevard) - While true, it doesn't describe what he was *doing* before being hit.
*   **C: Bumallasiw iti okupado a highway** (Crossing a busy highway) - The passage doesn't mention anything about crossing a highway.
*   **D: Kombinsiren ti maysa nga opisial ti polisia a bay-anna nga agtultuloy a mangpaltog** (Convincing a police officer to let him continue photographing) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti kondision ti presidente kalpasan ti panagpositibona ti virus?,"The correct answer is **D: Adda gurigorna** (He has a fever).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Malaksid iti **gurigor** ken panagsakit it karabukob, nasayaat ti riknak..."" (Aside from **fever** and body aches, his health is good...).  This directly indicates he *has* a fever.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Madi ti riknana** (His health is bad) - The passage says his health is *generally* good (""nasayaat ti kundision ti presidente"").
*   **B: Lumteg ti karabukobna** (His throat is sore) - The passage mentions body aches (""panagsakit it karabukob"") but doesn’t specifically say his throat is sore.
*   **C: Natalged ti kondisionna** (His condition is severe) - The passage states he is not seriously ill (""saan unay a nakaro"").



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti presidente ti agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **B: Agtalinaed isuna iti balay iti sumagmamano a lawas** (He will stay at home for a few days).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""mailasin isuna iti balayda iti mano nga aldaw"" (he will isolate himself at home for a few days).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awan ti gurigorna** (He has no fever) - The passage *does* mention he has a fever (""gurigor"").
* **C: Mayat ti riknana tapno maka-telecommute** (His condition is good enough to telecommute) - While true, the question asks what the passage says about *isolation*, not his ability to work.
* **D: Nakaro ti kasasaad ti virusna** (His viral load is severe) - The passage says the opposite: ""saan unay a nakaro"" (not very severe).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a manamnama a kumapsut ti Bagyo a Gonu?","The correct answer is **B: No kumapsut dagiti angin iti nasurok 83 a kilometro kada oras**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ti kapartak ti angin ket mapan a 83 km/h, ket manamnama a kumapkapsuten daytoy"" which translates to ""the initial wind speed is 83 km/h, and it is expected to intensify.""  This directly links the intensification of the storm to winds *exceeding* 83 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sakbayna a madanon ti Maldives** - The passage doesn't say when it will intensify, just that it *will* intensify.
*   **C: Sakbay a madanonna ti kapigpigsaanna** - This is too vague; the passage specifies a wind speed.
*   **D: Sakbay a madanonna dagiti angin a 149 a milya kada oras** - While the storm *reached* that speed, the passage doesn't say intensification will happen *before* reaching that speed. It says it will intensify *from* 83 km/h.



"
Kasano kapartak dagiti angin iti kapigpigsaan ti Bagyo a Gonu?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 a kilometro kada oras**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ti pegges ti angin a 240 kilometro kada oras (145 milia kada oras).""  However, it *also* states ""ti kapartak ti angin ket mapan a 83 km/h, ket manamnama a kumapkapsuten daytoy.""  This means the winds *started* at 83 km/h and *increased* to 240 km/h.  The question asks for the *peak* wind speed during the storm. The passage clarifies the peak was 240 km/h, equivalent to 145 mph. However, the closest answer choice to 145 mph is 149 kilometers per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 240 a milya kada oras** - This is the peak speed in miles *per hour*, but the question doesn't specify the unit.
*   **C: 149 a milya kada oras** - This is incorrect; it's a conversion error.
*   **D: 83 a kilometro kada oras** - This was the *initial* wind speed, not the peak.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a langa ti Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: Adu ti selyulana** (Many cells).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Karenia brevis, a naturally occurring single-celled organism...""  This means it's a *single*-celled organism, not one with *many* cells.  The red tide happens when there's a *high concentration* of these single cells, but the organism itself isn't multi-cellular.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tipo daytoy ti lumot** (This is a type of algae) - The passage explicitly states Karenia brevis is an algae.
* **B: Mabalinna a ma-disable dagiti urat ti tao** (It can disable human nerves) - The passage says it produces a neurotoxin that *can paralyze human nerves*.
* **D: Natural a mapaspasamak daytoy** (This happens naturally) - The passage states it's a ""naturally occurring"" organism and that natural factors can cause blooms.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kabaelan nga aramiden ti Karena brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: I-disable dagiti urat ti lames**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Agparpartuat ti lumot iti maysa a neurotoxin a mabalin a mangparalisa iti ur-urat ti *tao* ken ikan."" (The algae produces a neurotoxin that can paralyze the nerves of *humans* and fish.)
*   It specifically mentions humans and fish, *not* whales (lames). While the toxin could potentially affect whales, the text doesn't state that it does.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Napartak nga umadu iti aniaman a kondision** - The passage states natural conditions can allow the algae to bloom excessively.
*   **C: Apektaran ti danum** - This is a fundamental fact, as red tide *is* a condition of the water.
*   **D: Mangaramid ti neurotoxin** - The passage explicitly states the algae *produces* a neurotoxin.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a napasamak kas resulta ti Bagyo a Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Panaglayos ti kalsada (Landslides)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""agingga ita, awan pay ti naipadamag a nadadael wenno layus"" - meaning there have been *no reported damages or landslides* yet.
* **The passage *does* mention:**
    * **A: Makagunggona a panagtudo (Heavy rainfall):**  It states precipitation reached 6.34 inches.
    * **B: Tudo nga napakuyugan iti gurru-od (Rain accompanied by thunder):**  The passage says some studies had ""panagurruod ken naynay a panagkimat"" (thunder and frequent lightning).
    * **C: Maul-ulit a kimat (Frequent lightning):**  As mentioned above, lightning was reported.

Therefore, landslides are the *only* option that the passage explicitly states did *not* occur.



"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti saan nga agpaypayso maipapan ti Bagyo a Felicia?,"The correct answer is **D: Sumagmamano a tudo nga adda ti kimatna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dadduma kadagiti panagtudo ket addaan kadagiti panagurruod ken naynay a panagkimat."" (Some of the showers had thunder and brief flashes of lightning). This directly addresses a characteristic of the storm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti resultana a tudo ket nanggungona iti Oahu** (The resulting showers concentrated in Oahu) - While Oahu received significant rainfall, the passage says the storm *affected* most of the island, not just Oahu.
* **B: Damo a naikategoria kas tropikal a depresion sakbay a nagbalin a Kategoria 4 a bagyo** (Much was categorized as a tropical depression before becoming a Category 4 storm) - The passage states Felicia *became* a Category 4, then *weakened* to a tropical depression - the order is reversed in this option.
* **C: Kaaduan kadagiti isla ket natuduan** (Most of the islands were affected) - This is true, but not a specific *detail* about the storm itself, just its impact.



"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti nagbanagan ti 2009 a Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: Naikkat ni Piquet Jr. kalpasanna.**

Here's why:

The passage states ""Naribbek ni Piquet Jr. kalpasan ti 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This directly translates to ""Piquet Jr. was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""  The question asks what happened *at* the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix that led to consequences. Getting fired is the consequence mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naaksidente ni Fernando Alonso** - The passage doesn't mention Alonso having an accident in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
*   **B: Nangabak ni Piquet Jr.** - The passage doesn't mention Piquet Jr. winning.
*   **D: Ti lugan iti kinatalged ket naaksidente** - The passage refers to a crash in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, not the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.



"
Kaano a napasamak ti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagus kalpasan ti pit stop ni Alonso**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ni Piquet Jr. ket nadungpar idi 2008 Grand Prix ti Singapore kalpasan laeng ti nasapa a panagsardeng ti pit para kenni Fernando Alonso..."" which translates to ""Piquet Jr. crashed at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix immediately after an early pit stop for Fernando Alonso...""

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangikasapulan ti basbassit nga oras ngem ti orihinal a pammati dagiti sientista?","The correct answer is **A: Ti panagbuo ti species (The formation of species)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""dagiti baro a klase ket nagbaliw iti dua a henerasion, ngem daytoy a proseso ket mapatpati a nabaybayag"" (new classes have changed in two generations, but this process was thought to be long).  This directly means the *time it takes for species to form* was shorter than previously believed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangpadamag maipapan ti species (Research on the species):** The passage doesn't discuss the time it takes to *do research* on species, only the time it takes for them to *evolve*.
* **C: Panag-breed kadagiti agduduma nga species (Breeding different species):** The passage is about the formation of a new species, not artificial breeding.
* **D: Ti ebolusion ti species (The evolution of species):** While related to species formation, the passage specifically highlights that the *speed* of species formation was underestimated, making 'formation' a more precise answer than the broader concept of 'evolution.'



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naipadamag dagiti tagasukisok?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti nagan ti baro nga species**.

Here's why:

*   **P** focuses on *that* a new species was discovered, *how* it formed (hybridization), and *when* (over two generations – relatively quickly). It doesn't mention *what* the species is called.
*   **A** is incorrect because the passage explicitly states a new species *was* formed.
*   **B** is correct; the passage discusses the surprisingly short timeframe of the evolution.
*   **D** is implied; it mentions the finches involved in the breeding that led to the new species.

Therefore, the only piece of information *not* provided in the text is the actual name of the new species."
Sadinno a maangay ti CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti siudad ti Bucharest**.

The text explicitly states that Bucharest will be the first city in Southeastern Europe to continue the CowParade, making it clear the event will be held *in* Bucharest.  The other options are too broad or incorrect based on the provided information.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Daytoy ti kadakkelan a pasamak ti publiko nga artes iti lubong**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...sangkadakkelan ditoy lubong a pasamak ti arte para publiko..."" which translates to ""...the largest public art event in the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say the event is *only* held in ""creative"" cities. It states Bucharest is becoming the first in Southeastern Europe to host it.
*   **B:** While the City Hall of Bucharest is *supporting* the event, the event itself wasn't *made* by the City Hall.
*   **C:** The passage states Bucharest will be the first in *Southeastern Europe* to host it, not that the event is held throughout the region."
Ania ti gapu a sinuspende ti Russia ti panagusar ti II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa nga aksidente**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Pinasardeng iti Russia iti panagbiyahe dagiti Il-76 idi malpas daydiay nga aksidente."" (Russia suspended Il-76 flights after that accident.) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti interior a tropa** - The text mentions the Il-76 is used by military, but doesn't link that to the suspension.
*   **C: Ti militar ti Soviet** - This is background information about the plane, not the *reason* for the suspension.
*   **D: Ti maysa a naitantan nga imbestigasion** - While an investigation *is* happening, the suspension happened *because of* the accident, not just the investigation itself.



"
Ania ti II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa nga eroplano** (An airplane).

The text states: ""Ti Il-76 ket kangrunaan a mangbukel ti agpada a militar ti Russia ken Soviet..."" (The Il-76 primarily makes up the military fleet of Russia and the Soviet...) and mentions accidents *with the Il-76*. This clearly indicates it's a type of aircraft.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa a submarine** (A submarine) - The text discusses flight and accidents involving an aircraft, not underwater vehicles.
*   **B: Maysa a tangke** (A tank) - Tanks are land vehicles, and the text focuses on air travel.
*   **D: Maysa a tren** (A train) - Trains run on rails, while the text refers to air travel.



"
Siasino ti nag-hire ti grupo ti mannurat para ti The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Ni Simon**.

The text states: ""...isuna ti responsable iti panangala iti umuna a grupo dagiti mannurat ti pabuya."" (He was responsible for hiring the first group of show writers.) This clearly indicates Simon was the one who hired the writers.



"
"Segun iti Fluke, siasino ti mangipat-patulod kadagiti positibo a komento ken pangpapigsa ti nakem?","The correct answer is **D: Agpada a lalaki ken babbai nga indibidual**.

The passage states that Fluke reached her conclusion ""gapu iti kaadu dagiti positibo a komento ken pammaregta nga impatulod kenkuana ti agpada a babbai ken lallaki nga indibidual..."" This directly indicates that both men and women supported her view.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a kayat ti sumagmamano a tattao kadagiti babbai a saritaenda?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti lalaki nga indibidual**.

Here's why:

The passage states Fluke received negative feedback for suggesting that stories of people (specifically women) being harmed by the health of women should be shared. The passage then states that people responding to Fluke agreed that contraception is a medical necessity and should be available to *both* women *and* men. This implies some people *didn't* want to hear stories about men's health in relation to contraception - they felt the focus should be solely on women.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti medikal a gastos** - The passage doesn't mention objections to discussing medical costs.
*   **C: Salun-at ti babbai** - The passage actually describes a discussion *about* women's health.
*   **D: Fluke** - The passage focuses on the reactions *to* Fluke, not what people didn't want to hear *from* her specifically.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a planetary body ti pinakadinamiko?","The correct answer is **A: Lubong**.

The passage explicitly states: **“Kas ammotayo, adda maymaysa laeng a planeta a mangipakpakita iti kinaregta ngem Titan, ket ti naganna daytoy ket Lubong,”** which translates to ""As we know, there is only one planet that shows more activity than Titan, and its name is Earth.""

Therefore, Earth (Lubong) is the most dynamic planetary body according to the text.



"
Dagiti karayan ken dan-aw nga aglaon ti transparent a likido ket naamiris iti ania a planetary body?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aggaraw a kasla danum dayta... mabalin a makitam iti baba ti aniaman a bisil wenno narugit a lumot nga adda iti lansad."" (It looks like water... can be seen below any pebbles or rough moss on the land.) This clearly describes liquid on the surface of a planetary body.
* **The passage also quotes Stofan:** “Kas ammotayo, adda maymaysa laeng a planeta a mangipakpakita iti kinaregta ngem Titan...” (As we know, there is only one planet that shows surfaces like Titan...) 
* Therefore, the passage is specifically talking about **Titan** as a place with liquid (resembling water) on its surface.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jupiter:** Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface with rivers or lakes.
* **C: Ti Init (The Sun):** The Sun is a star, composed of plasma, and is far too hot for liquid water.
* **D: Saturn:** Saturn is also a gas giant, similar to Jupiter.



"
Ania kadagitoy a nabirukan ti saan a resulta ti natakkuatan iti dutdot?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti pannakaawat a dagiti dutdot ket saan a mausar iti panagtayab**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Insingsingasing ti istruktura ti dutdot a saan a mausar dagitoy iti panagtayab ngem ketdi para iti pannakatimbeng ti temperatura wneno kas maiparang."" This means the finding *challenges* the previous assumption that feathers were used for flight. The passage presents it as a new insight, not something confirmed by the feather sample.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti plumage a maris ti animal** - The passage specifically mentions the discovery of a multi-dimensional plumage.
*   **C: Makuna iti ebolusion ti dutdot** - The passage states that the feather structure suggests evolutionary improvements.
*   **D: Kumpirmasion nga addaan ti dutdot ti adu kadagiti dinosaur** - The passage starts by talking about a dinosaur *with* feathers, implying this is already understood, and focuses on details *about* those feathers.



"
Ania ti awan kadagiti dutdot ti dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti rachis**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Gapu ta dagiti dutdot ti dinosaur ket saan a naaramid a nalaing ti ungkayna, a maawagan iti rachis..."" (Because the feathers of the dinosaur were not made with a strong shaft, called a rachis...).  This means the feathers *lack* a rachis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti barbule** - The passage doesn't mention a lack of barbules, in fact it implies a more complex feather structure than just simple vanes.
*   **C: Nataengan a plumage** - The passage suggests the feather sample *shows* inherited plumage, not that it's missing.
*   **D: Ti napusiaw a maris iti akin-unegna** - The passage states the feathers *have* a faded color (maris), specifically carotenoid pigments.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti ZMapp ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Naaramid daytoy manipud kadagiti antibody**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iti maysa a mainom nga antibody, Zmapp..."" (In a monoclonal antibody, Zmapp...) This directly confirms that ZMapp *is* made from antibodies. Therefore, stating it is made from antibodies is **accurate** and doesn't contradict the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Kabaelanna nga agasan dagiti agdama nga impeksion ngem saan a manglap-lapped ti pannakatay** (It can treat current infections but doesn’t eliminate death) - The passage says ""awan pay dagiti droga a nalawag a mangipaneknek iti kinaepektiboda a makaagas kadagiti agdama nga impeksion"" and then says Zmapp ""addaan ti basbassit a benepisio a sapsapulenda iti panangprebentar ti patay"" (has little benefit needed to prevent death).
* **C: Nagserbi kas kontrol ti panagpadas iti PALM** (Served as a control in the PALM trial) - The passage clearly states, “nagserbi a kontrol ti Zmapp, kayatna sawen nga inusar dagiti sientista daytoy a kas pagibasaran ket inkomparada ti tallo pay a sabali a panangagas iti daytoy.” (Zmapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it).
* **D: Ipakita dagiti panagadal dagiti benepisiona ket basbassit ngem no ania ti damo a nakunada** (Studies show its benefits are small compared to what was hoped) - The passage states ""dagiti pormal a panagadal ket mangibaga nga iti daytoy ket addaan ti basbassit a benepisio a sapsapulenda iti panangprebentar ti patay."" (formal studies say that it has little benefit needed to prevent death).



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagpadas iti PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti ZMapp ket nausar kas baseline ti panagpadas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""In the PALM trial, Zmapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a benchmark and compared three other treatments to it."" This directly explains that Zmapp was the baseline for comparison in the PALM trial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inpakita dagiti panagadal a mabalin nga ad-adu ti benepisioda ngem ti damo a nakunada** - The passage doesn't say the other treatments *were* more beneficial, only that they were *compared* to Zmapp.
* **B: Ti agas ti panagkontrol ket naiyasping kadagiti tallo pay a sabali a panangagas, maysa kadagitoy ket ti ZMapp** - While technically true (Zmapp *was* a control), this doesn't fully capture *what* the control was *for* – it was a benchmark.
* **D: Naipakita nga epektibo daytoy iti panangagas kadagiti agdama a kondision** - The passage actually says Zmapp has ""limited benefit"" and wasn't highly effective.



"
Sadinno a makuna dagiti tagasukisok a kapapatganto ti baro a chip?,"The correct answer is **A: Kadagiti nababa ti matgedanna a pagilian**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the chip could help detect diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria *in developing countries* where survival rates for diseases like breast cancer are significantly lower compared to wealthier nations.  This indicates the primary intended benefit and target population.



"
Ania a wagasto ti mausar tapno maaramid ti dayagnostik nga alikamen?,"The correct answer is **A: Maysa a U.S. sentimo ti kada banag**.

The passage explicitly states the chip ""posible nga agbalor ti maysa a sentimo ti U.S. kada maysa"" (could cost one U.S. cent each).  This directly answers the question about the cost of the diagnostic tool.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kadawyan nga inkjet a printer:** While a regular inkjet printer *is used to make* the chip, it's not the cost *of* the diagnostic tool itself.
* **C: Dagiti mabalin a maiyimprenta a chip:** This describes *what* the tool is, not its cost.
* **D: Dagiti sabali pay a dayagnostik nga alikamen:**  The passage is specifically about *this* new diagnostic tool, not others.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng maipapan ti lobate scarps ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **C: Mabalin a resultada ti panagbassit ti bulan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nakadiskobre dagiti sientista dagiti porma iti daga a naiwaras iti entero a rabaw ti bulan a maawagan a lobate scarp a nalawag a nagresulta iti nabuntog unay a panagkessen ti bulan."" (Scientists have discovered landforms across the Moon's surface called lobate scarps that clearly resulted from the Moon shrinking significantly.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti pasamak a nangaramid kadagitoy ket napasamak itay nabiit:** The passage doesn't say *when* the events happened, just that the features indicate past shrinking.
* **B: Ti kaadda dagitoy kaipapananna a ti bulan ket saan nga agkurang iti geolohikal nga aktibidad:** The passage actually suggests the *opposite* - that the limited damage to the rocks indicates the events are relatively recent *in geological time*, implying less ongoing activity. The very fact they're preserved suggests a calmer recent history.
* **D: Bassit laeng ti nabirukan a kastoy iti rabaw ti bulan:**  The passage states they are found ""across the entire surface"" (naiwaras iti entero a rabaw ti bulan), which contradicts this option.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a theory maipapan kadagiti landform ti mangibaga nga adda ti geolohikal nga aktibidad a mapaspasamak iti bulan?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti landform ket naaramid itay nabiit laeng.**

* **The passage states:** ""nalawag a nagresulta iti nabuntog unay a panagkessen ti bulan"" (clearly resulted from very recent shrinking of the moon) and ""mangipakita a dagiti geolohiko a pasamak nga aramid kaniada ket kadagitoy laeng."" (showing that the geological events that created them happened only recently).  This directly supports the idea that the landforms (lobate scarps) are relatively new, indicating ongoing geological activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nabattag a buma-bassit ti bulan** (The moon has shrunk) - While the passage *implies* shrinking, it doesn't state it as a theory about the landforms themselves. It's a *cause* of the landforms, not the theory about them.
* **B: Dagiti landform ket naaramiden idi pay** (The landforms were formed a long time ago) - The passage explicitly contradicts this, stating they are recent.
* **C: Bassit laeng ti kaadu dagiti landform iti rabaw ti bulan** (There are few landforms on the surface of the moon) - The passage doesn't discuss the *quantity* of landforms, only their origin.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan nga umadon agingga ti indictment?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti diskusion ti ebidensia ti saksi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ngem ania man nga ebidensia ti testigo ket mabalin a narugitan gapu ta nawaras ti pannakaipablaak ti ladawanna."" This directly translates to ""but any witness evidence may be compromised because the publication of the images has been suspended."" This means discussion of the witness evidence is being held back until the indictment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti komento iti masakbayan (Follow-up comments):** The Crown Office is withholding *all* further comment, not just follow-up comments.
*   **B: Dagiti panangipablaak ti ladawan (Publication of images):** The publication of images is *already* suspended - it hasn't been withheld *until* the indictment.
*   **D: Dagiti panangipablaak ti artikulo (Publication of articles):** While related to the case, the text doesn't specifically say publication of articles is being withheld. It focuses on the image and witness evidence.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan nga agdama a problema para kadagiti sealer?","The correct answer is **A: Nakaro a kondision ti panawen**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Malaksid iti panangtumek kadagiti yelo, ad-adda pay a narigat ti panagsalbar gapu ta **nakaro ti kasasaad ti paniempo**."" (Aside from hunting for seals, it is also more difficult to survive because of **severe weather conditions**.)  This directly identifies the current problem for the sealers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti kaadu ti yelo (The amount of ice)** - The passage doesn't say there's *too much* ice, just that it's difficult to hunt *on* the ice.
* **C: Ti kapuskol ti yelo (The thickness of the ice)** - While thickness is mentioned, it's in relation to a past issue (the package of ice being a reason for seal decline over 15 years), not the current problem.
* **D: Ti marun-runaw a yelo (Thin ice)** - The passage doesn't specifically mention thin ice as the current problem.



"
"Malaksid iti yelo, ania pay ti mangapektar kadagiti panagregget a mangispal?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti kondision ti panawen** (Weather conditions).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Kinuna ni Pittman a dagiti kondision ket saan nga umimbag agingga iti sumaruno a lawas"" (Pittman said the conditions are not good until the next body/period). This directly links poor conditions to the difficulty in rescuing seals. The ""kasasaad ti paniempo"" (state of the weather) is also mentioned as a factor making rescue harder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kinakurang ti suplay** (Lack of supplies) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Kinakurang ti tulong** (Lack of help) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Dagiti sealer** (The sealers) -  The passage doesn't indicate sealers are affecting the seals' plight. It focuses on the ice and weather.



"
Ania a pammati ti saan a pinaneknekan ni Roberts?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti kina-etikal ti panagsarita maipapan kadagiti kaso**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states Roberts ""said it was unethical to comment on the details of a pending case."" This is what he refused to share his views on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti kinapateg dagiti di-bumaliw a ruling ti Korte Suprema** - Roberts *reiterated* that Roe v. Wade was ""the settled law of the land,"" showing he *does* believe in the importance of established rulings.
*   **C: Ti rugi ti biag** - Roberts *nagkedked* to talk about his views on when life begins, but that means he *has* a position, even if he won't share it publicly.
*   **D: Ti karbengan iti kinapribado** - Roberts stated he *believes* in a right to privacy as the basis for Roe v. Wade.



"
Ania a topiko ti narikna ni Roberts a saan nga etikal a pagsasaritaan?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti espesipiko a banag dagiti kaso** (The specific details of cases).

The passage states Roberts ""said it was unethical to comment on the details of pending cases.""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti di-bumaliw a Ruling ti Korte Suprema** (Past rulings of the Supreme Court) - He *did* comment on past rulings (Roe v. Wade).
* **B: Ti desision a Roe v. Wade** (The decision of Roe v. Wade) - He specifically mentioned Roe v. Wade.
* **C: Ti karbengan iti naipasimudaag a kinapribado** (The right to privacy) - He talked about his belief in this right.



"
Sadinno nga agran-raniag dagiti dua a silnag ti silaw?,"The correct answer is **A: Agturong iti tangatang** (They point upwards).

The passage specifically states: ""Dua a raniag ti silaw ti naipaturong nga agpangato iti tangatang..."" (Two beams of light were directed upwards towards the sky...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iti ballasiw ti siudad** (Across the city) - The passage doesn't mention the lights spanning across the city.
* **C: Iti puntiria ti umuna a jet** (To the target of the first jet) - While the jet is mentioned, the lights are described as pointing *upwards*, not towards the jet's target.
* **D: Iti tengnga ti sementerio** (To the middle of the cemetery) - The passage mentions the cemetery being *in the middle* of the area, but the lights are directed upwards, not at the cemetery.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a maipatakder dagiti baro nga skyscraper iti site?","The correct answer is **C: Iti agpatnag**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dua a raniag ti silaw ti naipaturong nga agpangato iti tangatang ti agpatnag Madama ti pannakabangon ti lima a baro a nangangato a pasdek..."" This translates to ""Two beams of light were directed upwards at the approaching dawn marking the beginning of the construction of five new skyscrapers...""

Therefore, the skyscrapers will be built at dawn (agpatnag).



"
Ania nga impormasion ti mangisingasing a ti The Seven Sisters ket kueba?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti panagduduma ti temperatura**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""infrared images of temperature variations from day and night show that these could be caves."" It highlights how the temperature differences (cooler during the day, warmer at night) are indicative of cave-like structures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti diametro dagiti pagserrekan iti kueba** - While the diameter is mentioned, it doesn't *prove* they are caves. It's just a descriptive characteristic.
*   **C: Dagiti geolohikal a surbey** - The passage mentions a geologist (Glen Cushing) but doesn't state that geological surveys were the primary evidence.
*   **D: Dagiti ladawan ti kueba iti Lubong** - The passage refers to infrared images, not regular pictures of caves on Earth.



"
Kasano a naobserbar ti thermal a panagtignay iti Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti infrared a ladawan** (Infrared images).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ipakita dagiti **infrared nga imahena** a dagiti panagduduma ti temperatura manipud rabii ken aldaw igat ken rabii ti mangipakita a mabalin a kueba dagitoy."" ( **Infrared images** show temperature differences from day and night that indicate these could be caves.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti adalem nga abut iti daga** (Deep ground features) - While the passage mentions the caves are like ""warm holes in the ground,"" this isn't *how* the temperature changes were observed.
* **C: Ti diametro dagiti kueba** (The diameter of the caves) - The diameter is a characteristic of the caves, but doesn't explain the observation method.
* **D: Dagiti surbey dagiti kueba iti Lubong** (Cave surveys on Earth) - The passage compares them to caves on Earth, but doesn't say surveys were done to observe the thermal changes.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a keddeng ti maipapan ti suspek ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Isuna ket saan nga nasugatan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti lalaki a mapabpabasol a nangpabettak diay bomba ket natiliw, kalpasan a nagsagaba iti panagbettak.""  This translates to ""The man suspected of detonating the bomb fled, after the explosion.""  Fleeing implies he was not injured in the explosion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nangusar isuna ti lugan bayat ti panangraut** (He used a location while attacking) - While true, it's not something the passage *doesn't* reveal; it states he used a three-way intersection.
* **B: Pinasabogna kano ti bomba** (He allegedly detonated the bomb) - The passage states he's *suspected* of detonating the bomb, meaning it's not definitively known.
* **C: Ammo dagiti autoridad ti pulina** (The authorities know his name) - The passage specifically says, ""Saan pay nga ammo dagiti autoridad ti naganna"" (The authorities do not yet know his name).



"
Ania nga impormasion maipapan ti panangraut ti nakumpirma dagiti autoridad?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti puli ti suspek**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""saan pay nga ammo dagiti autoridad ti naganna, nupay ammoda a miembro isuna iti etniko a grupo nga Uighur."" This directly translates to ""the authorities do not yet know his name, although they know he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.""  Knowing his ethnicity *is* information about his identity/puli (identity/background).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti kinasiasino ti aniaman a kakumplot (The identity of any conspirators):** The passage only mentions one suspect, not multiple conspirators.
* **C: Ti motibo iti likudan ti panangraut (The motive behind the attack):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the *why* of the bombing.
* **D: Ti umuna ken maudi a nagan ti suspek (The first and last name of the suspect):** The passage explicitly states the authorities *do not know* his name.



"
Ania kadagiti grupo ti agay-ayam iti Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa ken Australia**.

The text states: ""Maangay ti maudi a laban iti serye iti Ellis Park iti Johannesburg inton sumaruno a lawas, a kaay-ayam ti Springbooks ti Australia.""  ""Springboks"" is the nickname for the South African rugby team. Therefore, the match at Ellis Park is between South Africa and Australia.



"
Sadinno nga agay-ayam ti Springboks iti sumaruno nga ay-ayamda?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia**.

The text states: ""Maangay ti maudi a laban iti serye iti Ellis Park iti Johannesburg inton sumaruno a lawas, a kaay-ayam ti Springbooks ti **Australia**."" 

Therefore, the Springboks will play against Australia in their next match."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nagrigatan ti space station bayat ti mission da?,"The correct answer is **B: Panagpatalinaed ti gyroscope**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the station *lost* its gyroscope, which led to problems with position and control, particularly during a spacewalk.  The rest of the passage details how ground control in Russia had to react to regain control (using jets and restoring the station's orientation).  The root cause of the difficulty was the missing gyroscope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagtalinaed ti umno a distansia manipud kadagiti thruster:** While distance from thrusters is important, the passage focuses on the *loss of the gyroscope* as the primary problem.
*   **C: Panagyussuat ti jet:**  The jets were *used to fix* the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: Panangpasubli iti gagangay a garaw:**  Similar to the jets, restoring the station's orientation was a *solution* to the problem, not the problem itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti gandat ti mision ti space station?","The correct answer is **A: Panangbirok iti napukaw a gyroscope** (Finding the lost gyroscope).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the problem was ""kaawan ti gyroscope"" (the loss of the gyroscope) and that this happened ""idi damo iti space station mission"" (during the space station mission).  The whole passage revolves around this issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagasideng kadagiti adjustment a thruster** (Inspecting the adjustment thrusters): While thrusters *were* used to correct the problem, the mission wasn't *to inspect* them. They were used as a solution.
* **C: Panangkumpleto ti spacewalk** (Completing the spacewalk): The spacewalk was interrupted *because* of the gyroscope issue.
* **D: Panag-activate kadagiti jet** (Activating the jets): Similar to B, activating the jets was a reaction to the problem, not the goal of the mission.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti kaso ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Naidarum dayta iti estado a nakaikabilan ti AOL**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the case occurred **in Virginia**. It doesn't mention where AOL is *based* or incorporated. While AOL was involved, the location of the case itself isn't directly linked to AOL's home state.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Naaramid ti kombiksion** - The passage states a ""judgment was obtained,"" implying a conviction or ruling against the individual.
*   **C: Ti lehislasion maipapan ti spam email ket nausar iti kaso** - The passage specifically says the case was the first to use the 2003 anti-spam law.
*   **D: Naidarum ti AOL** - The passage states AOL filed the complaints, meaning they were involved in the case.



"
Ania kadagtii sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a manganninaw ti kaso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti AOL ket naidarum iti saan a naipalubos a panangiwaras.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that AOL filed the complaints and that the case revolved around stopping unwanted (spam) email from being sent. Therefore, AOL was harmed by the unauthorized distribution of email.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti kaso ket nanginaig ti dua a umun-una a tagaipaay ti serbisio iti internet** - The passage only mentions AOL as the prominent internet service provider involved.
*   **C: Ti kaso ket naidarum idi 2003** - While the legislation used in the case *became* law in 2003, the case itself wasn’t necessarily filed *in* 2003; the passage only mentions this as the year the law took effect.
*   **D: Inrugi ti AOL ti pannakaidarum ti kaso** - The passage states AOL *filed complaints* – this doesn’t necessarily mean they initiated the entire legal process, only that they were the complainant.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a club ti nangrugian nga inay-ayam ti Vidal tallo a season ti napalabasen?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The text states: ""Iti 28 ti tawenna a ni Vidal ket simmali iti Barça tallo a tawen ti napalabasen, **naggapu iti Sevilla**."" (Vidal, 28 years old, joined Barça three seasons ago, **coming from Sevilla**.)

Therefore, Sevilla is the club Vidal played for before Barça.



"
Mano nga ay-ayam ti naay-ayam ti Vidal para ti Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**. 

The passage explicitly states: ""ni Vidal ket nagay-ayam ti 49 nga ay-ayam para iti klab."" (Vidal scored 49 goals for the club).



"
Siasino ti kalaban a grupo iti ay-ayam?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states that the game is ""kontra iti Bolonia"" (against Bolonia). Therefore, Bolonia is the opposing team.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarque** - Jarque is a player, not the opposing team.
*   **C: Coverciano** - Coverciano is a location (training center).
*   **D: Italy** - Italy is a country, not the opposing team.



"
Apay a nagtalinaed ni Jarque iti hotel?,"The correct answer is **A: Nagsanay isuna**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ni Jarque ket agprakpraktis kabayatan iti panag-training sakbay ti season idiay Coverciano idiay Italia nasapa iti aldaw."" (Jarque was practicing during pre-season training in Coverciano, Italy early in the day.) and ""Agtalinaed isuna idiay hotel sakbay ti naiplano a salip para iti Domingo laban iti Bolonia."" (He stayed at the hotel before the scheduled game on Sunday against Bologna.) This clearly indicates he stayed at the hotel *because* he was training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Adda ti pre-season a mitingna** - The passage doesn't mention a meeting.
*   **C: Adda ti ay-ayamna idi Domingo** - The passage mentions a game on Sunday, not an exam.
*   **D: Agsan-sanay isuna kadua ni Bolonia** - He's playing *against* Bologna, not training with them.



"
Apay a saan a nangipaay ti pakdaar ti ahensia ti geophysics ti Jakarta?,"The correct answer is **D: Saanna a nasabat ti kasapulan a magnitude para kadagiti gingined.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...awan ti pakdaar ti tsunami a mairuar gapu ta **saan a nadanon ti ginggined ti 6.5 magnitude.**"" This directly translates to ""there was no tsunami warning because the magnitude was not reached at 6.5.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awan ti peggad ti tsunami:** The passage doesn't say there was no earthquake, only no *tsunami* warning.
* **B: Tapno maliklikan ti panagdanag dagiti residente:**  The agency's decision isn't about avoiding panic; it's about scientific criteria.
* **C: Tapno maliklikan ti epekto kadagiti lokal a negosio:**  The agency doesn't base warnings on economic impact.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naigapu ti ginggined?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a 6.5 iti pagrukodan ti magnitude**.

Here's why:

The text states the reason there was no tsunami warning was ""saan a nadanon ti ginggined ti 6.5 magnitude"" (did not reach a magnitude of 6.5).  This directly answers the question of what the magnitude was.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nagbuteng dagiti residente (Residents panicked)** - This is a *result* of the earthquake, not the cause of the magnitude.
* **B: Ti pakdaar ti tsunami (The tsunami warning)** -  The text states there *wasn't* a tsunami warning.
* **C: Ti nairuar a pakdaar (The initial warning)** - The text refers to an initial feeling of an earthquake, but the *reason* for no tsunami warning is the magnitude.



"
Ania kadagitoy ti mangparnuay ti aktibidad iti Init ken amin a bituen?,"The correct answer is **D: Karaniag ti silaw, Rossby a bilang, ken rotasion**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ti aktibidad ti amin a bituen... paggarawen ti kinaraniagda, panagrikusda..."" which translates to ""the activity of all stars... is characterized by their brightness, rotation...""  This directly links brightness (karaniag ti silaw) and rotation (panagrikus) to activity.
* **The passage also states:** ""Musar nga agpada ti panagrikus ken kinaraniag tapno maammuan ti Rossby a numero ti maysa a bituen..."" meaning Rossby number is *calculated from* rotation and brightness.  The passage then links Rossby number to magnetic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Karaniag ti silaw ken plasma flow:** While brightness is mentioned, plasma flow isn't directly tied to the explanation of activity in the passage.
* **B: Rossy a bilang, rotasion ken dagiti magnetic a reversal:**  Rossby number and rotation are related, but the passage doesn't state magnetic reversals *cause* activity, only that Rossby number is related to them.
* **C: Rotasion ken karaniag ti silaw:** This is partially correct, but doesn’t include the important link to the Rossby number, which is a key indicator of activity level.



"
Kasano a maamiris ti Rossby a bilang ti bituen?,"The correct answer is **A: Karaniag ti silaw ken rotasion (Brightness and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Musar nga agpada ti panagrikus ken kinaraniag tapno maammuan ti Rossby a numero ti maysa a bituen..."" which translates to ""Use brightness and rotation to determine the Rossby number of a star...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti kaadu ti plasma flow (The amount of plasma flow):** While plasma flow is *related* to stellar activity, it's not directly used to *calculate* the Rossby number according to the text.
* **C: Ti lebel ti aktibidad (The level of activity):**  The Rossby number is used to *understand* activity level, not to measure it directly.
* **D: Ti kaadu dagiti magnetic reversal (The amount of magnetic reversal):**  The passage states a *low* Rossby number means *fewer* magnetic reversals, but it doesn't say the number of reversals is used to *calculate* the Rossby number.



"
Ania a porsiento ti tattao a nasurbey ti mangsuporta ti Australia nga agbalin a republika a dagus?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 a porsiento**.

The passage states: ""Ti agsinnumbangir a maudi a panagbutos, **29 porsiento** kadagiti nadamag ket mamati a masapul nga agbalin a republika ti Australia iti nadaras a panawen..."" which translates to ""The last poll showed, **29 percent** of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic in the near future.""
"
"Segun ken ni Julie Gillard, kaano a kasapulan nga agbalin a republika ti Australia?","The correct answer is **B: Kalpasan ti panagturay ni Reyna Elizabeth II**.

The text explicitly states: ""Imbaga ni Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard idi kampania para iti pederal nga eleksion idi 2010 a mamati isuna a masapul nga agbalin ti Australia a republika inton malpas ti panagturay ni Reyna Elizabeth II."" (Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.)



"
Ania nga organisasion ti madama a legal a maim-imbestigaran?,"The correct answer is **C: Planned Parenthood**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Planned Parenthood is under investigation due to concerns about how they spend and report their money, specifically regarding potential funding of abortions.  The other options are involved *in* the investigation, but are not the subject *of* it:

* **A: Ti House Energy and Commerce Committee** - This committee is overseeing the investigation.
* **B: Ti Komen Foundation** - This foundation changed its funding policies *because* of the investigation.
* **D: Ti Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee** - This subcommittee is conducting the investigation.



"
Ni Cliff Steams ket ti mangidadaulo ti ania a komite?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**.

The passage states: ""...dagiti buis ket maus-usar a pangpondo kadagiti aborsion babaen ti Planned Parenthood gapu ta isu ti tserman ti **Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**, nga idadauluan ti House Energy and Commerce Committee."" 

This directly states that Cliff Stearns is the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. While he is part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, he *leads* the Subcommittee.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan a napasamak iti babai a Swiss?","The correct answer is **B: Napapatay isuna** (She was killed).

Here's why:

The text states the woman was *robbed* (""nangrames""), but it explicitly says her belongings were *recovered* (""napasublimi""). It doesn't mention any harm coming to her beyond the robbery. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naisubli dagiti natakaw a tagikuaenna** (Her stolen belongings were recovered) - This *did* happen, but the question asks what *didn't* happen.
*   **C: Narames isuna ti 5 a tattao** (She was robbed by 5 people) - This *did* happen, it's the basis of the report.
*   **D: Natakaw ti telepono ken laptopna** (Her phone and laptop were stolen) - This *did* happen, and is the reason for the police action.



"
Ania a kompania ti nagunggonaan ti Taiwan Sustainable Award idi 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states that ASUS received the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.



"
Ania ti ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a laptop**.

The text explicitly states ""laptop a kumpiuter"" when referring to the ASUS Eee PC. It also describes it as being designed for portability and cost-saving, characteristics of laptops.



"
Siasino ti akin-rebbeng kadagiti mapukpukaw a postal a dokumento?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa nga ubing a lalaki**.

The passage explicitly states that a young boy was responsible for losing the 600 documents, including the New Year's postcards. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti empleado iti postal (Postal employees):** While the employees are involved in the aftermath, they weren't the ones who lost the cards.
* **B: Maysa a grupo dagiti residente ti Obanazawa (A group of Obanazawa residents):** The residents *complained* about the missing cards, but didn't lose them.
* **D: Ti tagaiwarnak (The carrier):** The passage doesn't mention the carrier being responsible for the loss.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nagpakawan maipapan kadagiti mapukpukaw a dokumento?","The correct answer is **B: Ti ubing a lalaki**.

The passage states that a young boy (""iti ubing a lalaki"") was found to have stolen (""nangilemmeng"") the documents, including the New Year's postcards.  Therefore, he is the one responsible for the missing documents.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti lokal a residente** - They *reported* the issue, they didn't cause it.
*   **C: Ti tagaiwarnak** - The passage doesn't mention anyone reporting the issue.
*   **D: Ti post office ti Obanazawa** - The post office *acknowledged* the issue and made an apology, but didn't cause it."
Kaano a kasapulan a sanguen ni Del Potro ti parikutna iti abagana?,"The correct answer is **C: Bayat ti maikadua a set**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Naagasan ti abaga ni Potro iti daytoy a punto ngem nabaelanna ti agsubli iti ay-ayam"" which directly translates to ""Potros' shoulder was strained at this point but he was able to return to play."" This happened *while* the second set was in progress (specifically when the score was 6-6).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bayat ti immuna a set** - The passage states Murray was broken during the first set, not Del Potro having shoulder issues.
*   **B: Sakbay ti immuna a panangburak iti panagpadada** - This is too early, the issue happened during the second set.
*   **D: Kalpasan ti maikatlo a panangburak iti panagpadada** - There is no mention of a third break point in the passage.



"
Ania ti resulta ti umuna a tie break?,"The correct answer is **A: Naabak ni Murray iti umuna a set**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Naabak ni Murray iti immuna a set..."" (Murray won the first set). The question asks for the result of the *first* tie break, and the passage tells us Murray won the first set, implying he won the tie break that determined that set.



"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, siasino, iti partikular, ti naiwarnak iti pasiente?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti ubbing**.

Here's why:

The text states, “Ita nga aldaw, naammuantayo a dagiti dadduma nga ubbing nga agtawen iti kas kadagiti ages-eskuela ti naaddaan iti kontak iti pasiente.” This directly identifies children of school age as having been in contact with the patient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti gobernador (The governor):** The text mentions the governor *reporting* the situation, not being in contact with the patient.
*   **C: Dagiti opisial ti Texas (Texas officials):** While officials are involved in addressing the situation, the text doesn't state they had contact with the patient.
*   **D: Dagiti lokal nga umili (Local residents):** The text specifies *children* were in contact, not residents in general.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kasiguraduan ti saan nga inaramid ti gobernador idi sinangona dagiti umili ti Texas?","The correct answer is **D: Saan a serioso ti kasasaad**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Perry said, ""Serioso daytoy a kasasaad."" (This situation is serious.) Therefore, he *did* convey the seriousness of the situation. Options A, B, and C are all things he *did* assure the people of Texas about.  Only option D represents something he specifically denied.



"
Ania a news parody source ti inaramid ti dua a dati nga estudiante ti UW?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti Onion**.

The passage explicitly states that Heck and Johnson created a satirical publication *before* The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, and that publication was **The Onion**. The rest of the passage details the growth and success of The Onion.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti saan a nairaman iti The Onion nga imperio ti parodi a damdamag?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a pelikula**.

The passage explicitly mentions the following as part of The Onion's empire:

*   A printed edition
*   A website
*   Personal announcements
*   A 24-hour news network
*   Podcasts
*   A world atlas (""Our Dumb World"")

It does **not** mention a film/pelikula being part of their empire.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti guar-guardiaan ti pulis?","The correct answer is **C: Ti pagserrekan iti Downing Street**.

The text explicitly states: ""naguardiaan ti polis a mapan idiay kalsada ti Downing, nga isu ti opisial a residente ti Primero a Ministro."" This means the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Square:** While the protest *passed by* Trafalgar Square, the police weren't guarding it.
*   **B: Ti Spring Forum:** This is the event the protesters were potentially heading towards, not where the police were stationed.
*   **D: Ti hotel a Grand Connaught Rooms:** This is where the Spring Forum was held, not the location of the police guard.



"
Ania nga oras a kiniddaw dagiti pulis dagiti protestante nga umakar tapno maliklikan ti ad-adda panagbattag ti trapiko?,"The correct answer is **D: Idi 11:20**.

The passage states: ""Idi 11:20, sinaludsudan dagiti polis dagiti agprotprotesta nga umakarda nga agpalikod idiay bangketa, ibagbagada a kasapulanda nga ibalanse ti karbenganda nga agprotesta iti maur-urnong a trapiko."" This directly answers the question.



"
Ania ti agpaypayso maipapan ti sukisok nga inaramid ni Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti sumagmamano a diabetic a bao ket saanen a diabetic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Addaan kami ti 4-a-bulan a babbao a dati ket diabetic ngem saan itan,"" (We had a 4-month-old baby who was diabetic but isn't now). This directly supports the idea that some diabetic babies are no longer diabetic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti resulta ket mabalin a makabenepisio kadagiti pasiente nga addaan ti agdama a Type 1 a diabetes:** The passage explicitly states Dr. Ur doubts the findings apply to those *with* Type 1 diabetes.
* **C: Positibo isuna a dagiti natakuatan ket mabalin a makaiyawat ti agas:** The passage states he *doubts* if diabetes can be cured (positive about it).
* **D: Ti sumagmamano a saan a diabetic a bao ket diabetic itan:** The passage doesn't mention babies who *became* diabetic, only those who were and are no longer.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti pagduaduaan ni Dr. Ur?","The correct answer is **B: No posible ti agas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""pagduaduaanna no mabalin a maagasan ti diabetes..."" which translates to ""he doubts if diabetes can be cured."" This directly reflects a questioning of the possibility of a cure (agas).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't mention if the findings are valuable for Type 1 diabetes patients, only that they *aren't* related to them.
*   **C:** The text mentions other experts, but focuses on *Dr. Ur's* doubt.
*   **D:** The text doesn't discuss whether a non-diabetic baby will remain that way.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a manganninaw ti pannakadungpar ti Flight CG4684?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti eroplano ket orihinal a saan a makadisso gapu ti panawen.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Naisardeng ti panagsapul gapu iti isu met laeng a madi a panawen a nakaigapuanan ti saan a natuloy a panagdissona.""  This directly translates to ""The search was halted because of the bad weather that caused the initially aborted takeoff.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dimmungpar ti eroplano iti maysa a narigat a mabirukan a lugar** - While true, the *reason* for the initial problem wasn't the difficult terrain, but the weather.
* **C: Namitlo a pinadas ti eroplano ti agdisso sakbay a nadungpar** - The passage only mentions two attempted takeoffs, not three.
* **D: Ti panangbirok iti lugar a nakaidungparan ti eroplano ket naapektaran ti panawen** - The weather affected the *initial takeoff attempt*, not the search *after* the crash.



"
Ania ti gapu ti panangibabawi ti Flight CG4684 ti panagdissona?,"The correct answer is **A: Saan a madanon ti lugar a pagdissuan** (The landing site was inaccessible).

Here's why:

The text states: ""ngem naibabawi ti panagdissona apaman a nakasaganan"" (but the landing was aborted when it was realized) and ""narigat unay a mastrek isu a impatinnagda ti dua a polis"" (it was very difficult to reach so two police officers were dispatched). This clearly indicates the landing was aborted because the landing site was difficult, or impossible, to reach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Adda ti sumagmamano a sabali pay nga eroplano nga immuna iti CG4684** (There were other planes ahead of CG4684) - The text doesn't mention other planes.
*   **C: Ti eroplano ket nagsabali ti rutana a mapan iti Kokoda** (The plane changed its route to Kokoda) - The text doesn't say the route changed.
*   **D: Nakapuy ti kasasaad ti paniempo** (The weather conditions were bad) - While weather *could* be a reason, the text specifically mentions the difficulty of reaching the landing site.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti kapadasan ni Franciszek Kowal ti agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Nadunor isuna bayat ti panagpadasna a bittaken ti tawa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kinuna ti *nakalasat* a ni Franciszek Kowal"" - meaning Franciszek Kowal is *dead* (nakalasat = deceased).  The context of his statement is about people having their teeth pulled to escape, and a tooth being extracted *from him* (""nangrugida a rummuar iti tawa""). This implies he died *during* the tooth extraction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naimatonanna a mabittak ti tawa** - While teeth *were* being pulled, the passage doesn't say he witnessed it happening to someone else. It describes it happening *to him*.
* **B: Saan a nadunor isuna iti kamaudiananna** - The passage explicitly states he is deceased (""nakalasat"").
* **C: Nangperdi isuna ti tugaw bayat ti panagruarna** - The passage states people were losing teeth (""tattao ket pinerdida dagiti tawa""), but doesn't say he lost his fillings. It focuses on the teeth themselves being removed.



"
Apay a narigat a marukod ti mabalin nga epekto ti Bagyo a Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Adayo nga ag-landfall ti bagyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agsipud ta adayo pay a sumanglad ti bagyo, agtalinaed a narigat a maibaga ti mabalin nga epektona iti Estados Unidos wenno iti Caribbean.""  This directly translates to ""Because the storm is still far away, it remains difficult to say what its possible effects will be on the United States or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti bagyo ket naipadles nga agbalin a napigsa a bagyo** - While the storm *is* expected to strengthen, that doesn't explain *why* it's hard to predict the impact.
*   **B: Dagiti sientista ket saan a sigurado maipapan kadagiti masustenar nga angin ti bagyo** - The passage mentions the wind speed (40mph) and a forecast for strengthening, it doesn't state uncertainty about the winds themselves.
*   **D: Ti bagyo ket adayo unay iti Miami** - Being far from Miami is a factor, but the key reason for difficulty in predicting impact is the overall distance to *land* (US and Caribbean).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti Bagyo a Danielle ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Asideg ti panag-landfallna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Danielle is 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida.** This clearly indicates it is *not* close to making landfall.
* **A: Saan nga ammo ti epektona iti Caribbean** - This *is* stated in the passage (""agtalinaed a narigat a maibaga ti mabalin nga epektona...iti Caribbean"").
* **B: Nabuo daytoy iti Atlantic Ocean** - The passage confirms Danielle formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
* **C: Mabalin nga agbalin a napigsa a bagyo** -  The scientists predict Danielle will strengthen into a hurricane.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naikalikagum ti kasapulan a mapasamak iti sakit sakbay a mangigapu ti sangalubongan nga epidemia?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti sintomas ket masapul nga agtalinaed a saan unay a nakaru.**

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Lee believes the disease *becomes* non-lethal *before* causing a global epidemic. This means the severity of symptoms (how ""nakaru"" or severe they are) needs to decrease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Masapul a makissayan ti kinakarona a makapatay** - The passage says the opposite - it needs to *stop* being lethal.
* **C: Adu a tattao ti masakup a maimpeksionan** - The passage doesn't focus on the *number* of people infected, but rather the *severity* of the illness.
* **D: Masapul a mapadasan dagiti ubbing dagiti sintomas** -  The passage mentions children being infected, but it doesn’t say they *need* to experience symptoms for an epidemic to occur.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano kaadayo ti bagyo manipud ti Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: 70 a kilometro**.

The passage states: ""Iti rabii ti Agosto 9, ti mata ti Morakot ket agarup **pitopulo a kilometro** ti kaadayona manipud ti probinsia ti Tsina a Fujian.""  (On the evening of August 9, the eye of Morakot was approximately **seventy kilometers** away from China's Fujian province.)

The other options are incorrect because they are not mentioned in the text. The 9 and 11 kilometer figures refer to the storm's speed, not its distance from Fujian. 77 kilometers isn't mentioned at all."
Siasino ti nangkablaaw ken ni George W. Bush bayat ti panagsangpetna iti Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Da Wong Kan Seng ken Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text explicitly states that George W. Bush met with Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng *and* Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti Kangrunaan a Ministro (The Prime Minister)** - While he met with the Prime Minister, he *also* met with the Deputy Prime Minister.
* **B: Maysa nga agbuy-buya (A reporter)** - He spoke *to* reporters, but they didn't meet *with* him.
* **D: Ti Sumaruno iti Kangrunaan a Ministro (The Deputy Prime Minister)** - He met with the Deputy Prime Minister, but also the Prime Minister.



"
Kaano nga insarita ti presidente ti maipapan ti panagpalawa ti negosio iti Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalpasan ti amin a pannakaabakna iti midterm nga eleksion**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kalpasan ti makadominggo a pannakaabak ti kagudua a termino nga eleksion, imbaga ni Bush kadagiti agbuybuya ti panangpalawa ti negosio idiay Asia.""  This directly translates to ""After winning his second-term election, Bush told reporters about expanding business in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayat ti panagsangpetna iti Singapore** - While he *was* in Singapore when the news was reported, the text specifies he spoke about business expansion *after* the election.
* **B: Kadua ni Wong Kan Seng** - He discussed business and terrorism *with* Wong Kan Seng, but didn’t specifically mention expansion then.
* **D: Bayat ti uppat a lawas a panaglibotna iti Asia** - The text doesn’t say the comment was made during the entire tour, only *after* the election at the start of the tour.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kadagupan a gandat ti gobierno?","The correct answer is **C: Mangala ti kanayonan a 1,300 a carriage**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the government initiative aimed to fund villages to obtain carriages, increasing the total from 300 to 1,300. This clearly indicates the government's goal was to have 1,300 carriages available in villages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pondoan ti ad-adu pay a carriage inton Marso ti daytoy a tawen** - While the initiative happened in March, the *goal* wasn't just to fund more carriages, but to *acquire* a specific number.
* **B: Mangala ti 300 a kadagupan a carriage** -  The passage explicitly states they were *increasing* from 300, not aiming for 300 total.
* **D: Mapabang-aran ti adu unay a tao iti carriage** - The passage doesn't mention the benefit to people, only the increase in the number of carriages.



"
Ania ti inyanunsio ti gobierno?,"The correct answer is **C: Planoda ti mangpondo iti kanayonan a 1,300 a carriage**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""nangipaatiddag ti kari ti gobierno...tapno maikkan ti pondo ti nayon a karison...adda nainayon a 300 a namagbalin iti dagup a 1,300 a karuahe a maala...""  This directly translates to the government announcing a plan to fund 1,300 carriages for the villages (starting with an initial 300).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect. It only mentions the initial 300, not the final 1,300.
* **B:** Incorrect. The passage talks about *providing* carriages, not *solving* a carriage problem.
* **D:** Incorrect. The passage mentions March as the time the initiative was made, not when a problem will be solved. It also focuses on carriages, not people.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania nga impormasion ti ammo?","The correct answer is **C: Manamnama ti maysa nga panangraut** (A raid is expected).

Here's why:

* **Kunana's statement directly says:** ""Awan ti sirib a makaibaga nga iti maysa a panag-atake ket manamnama a dandanin."" This translates to ""It is wise to say that a raid is expected.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti lebel ti pangta ket nakissayan (The level of threat is decreasing):** The statement says the level *might* decrease, but doesn't confirm it.  It explicitly says decreasing the threat level doesn't eliminate all threat.
* **B: Awanen ti aniaman a pangta (There is no threat):**  The statement directly contradicts this. It anticipates a raid.
* **D: Pinasingkedan ti Intelligence a nakaro ti panangraut (Intelligence has highlighted the raid):** The passage doesn't mention anything about intelligence. It’s a general statement about preparedness.



"
Ania a keddeng maipapan kadagiti protesta ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti presidensial komision ket maysa a sungbat kadagiti protesta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti komision ket isu ti sungbat ti Martelly iti nasaknap a protesta..."" (The commission is Martelly's response to widespread protests...) This directly answers the question of what the protests led to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti naitantan nga eleksion ket nangigapu ti protesta** - The passage says the protests are *about* elections, and a desire for *new* elections, but doesn't state the protests *caused* existing elections.
* **C: Dagiti protesta ket nagdemanda ti panagikkat ti napalabas a CEP** - While the passage mentions a recommendation to dissolve the previous CEP, it doesn't specifically say the protests *demanded* this.  It's a step taken *in response* to the protests.
* **D: Dagiti protesta no maminsan ket narungsot** - This is a true statement *from* the passage, but doesn't explain what the protests *led to*. It's a description *of* the protests, not a consequence *of* them.



"
Siasino ti nangikalikagum nga agikkat ti napalabas a CEP?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti presidensial komision** (The presidential commission).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Idi napalabas a bulan, maysa a presidential commission ti nangirekomenda iti panaglusulos ti dati a CEP kas paset dagiti pamuspusan tapno makaaddang ti nasion para kadagiti baro nga eleksion."" (Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the former CEP as part of efforts to allow the nation to prepare for new elections.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ni Martelly:** While Martelly appointed the commission, the *commission* itself recommended the dissolution, not Martelly directly.
*   **B: Dagiti protestante:** The protesters demanded changes, but they didn't directly dissolve the CEP. Their protests led to the commission being formed.
*   **D: Dagiti miembro ti CEP ti nangikalikagum mismo:** The passage doesn't mention the CEP members initiating their own dissolution.



"
"Segun iti keddeng, ania ti saan a supsuportaran ti USA Gymnastics kalpasan ti panagabuso ni Nassar kadagiti atleta?","The correct answer is **A: Desertipikasion** (De-certification).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...ken saan ket a panangikkat iti sertipikasion."" ( ""...and not to the removal of certification.""). This directly indicates that USA Gymnastics *does not support* the removal of their certification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Panangaramid ti makapaallukoy a lawlaw** (Creating a safer environment) - The text clearly states they support creating a safer environment for athletes.
*   **C: Dagiti kasapulan a panagbalbaliw iti uneg ti organisasion** (Necessary changes within the organization) - They explicitly state they will support any needed changes.
*   **D: Maysa nga independiente nga imbestigasion** (An independent investigation) - They also state they support an independent investigation.



"
"Segun iti keddeng, ania ti kangrunaan a gandat ti USA Gymnastics ken ti United States Olympic Committee para ti pagannayasanda?","The correct answer is **D: Panangitandudo ti natalged a lawlaw para kadagiti atleta**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Addaan iti agpada a panggep ti USA Gymnastics ken ti USOC — ti mamagbalin iti isport a gymnastics, ken dadduma pay, a natalged para kadagiti atleta tapno magun-odda ti arapaapda iti natalged, positibo ken napabileg nga aglawlaw."" (USA Gymnastics and the USOC share a common goal – to make gymnastics, and all sports, a safe environment for athletes to achieve their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agsilsilnag a lawag iti panangabuso ni Larry Nassar:** While acknowledging the abuse is important, the passage focuses on *preventing* future abuse by creating a safer environment, not just revealing past abuse.
* **B: Panagituloy ti desertipikasion:** The passage specifically states they *oppose* decertification.
* **C: Panagituloy ti pribado nga imbestigasion:** They support an *independent* investigation, but the ultimate goal isn’t just the investigation itself, but the improvements that will come from it.



"
Sadinno a mapan ti barko idi napasamak ti insidente? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text explicitly states: ""ti barko ket mapan iti Puerto Princesa idiay Palawan"" (the ship was located in Puerto Princesa, Palawan) when the incident occurred.



"
Ania ti saan nga agpaypayso maipapan ti barko a naisaad iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **C: Daytoy ket mine countermeasures a barko**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the ship is an Avenger-class *mine countermeasures* ship.** This is a specific type of ship designed to deal with mines.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Daytoy ket paapan ti Puerto Princesa** - While the ship *was* in Puerto Princesa, that’s just its location at the time, not a defining characteristic.
    * **B: Daytoy ket nakabase iti Palawan** - The ship is based in Sasebo, Japan, not Palawan.
    * **D: Daytoy ket naidutok iti Maikapito a Fleet ti U.S. Navy** - The passage states this is true, but it's *also* stated that it is a mine countermeasures ship.  The question asks for what is *not* implied.



"
Siasino ti nangipatulod ti keddeng maipapan kadagiti tropa ti US?,"The correct answer is **A: Ni Donald Trump**.

The text explicitly states that ""ti Presidente ti Estados Unidos a ni Donald Trump, ket imbagana a dagiti buyot ti Estados Unidos ket pumanawen iti Syria."" (The President of the United States, Donald Trump, said that US troops would leave Syria.) While the decision was *after* a phone call with Erdoğan, Trump is the one who made the decision and announced it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a pagilian ti nakin-rebbeng ti panag-guardia kadagiti balud a tagalaban?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The text states: ""Ti Turkey ket mangsublat a mangbantay kadagidiay natiliw a mannakilaban nga ISIS..."" which translates to ""Turkey will take over guarding the remaining ISIS fighters..."" 

Therefore, Turkey is the country taking responsibility for guarding the fighters.



"
Ania ti patienda a gapu ti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **C: Banbantay a dalan** (Mountainous terrain).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Natnag ti helicopter iti nangato a paset ti kabambatayan"" (The helicopter crashed in a high part of the mountains). It also mentions the difficulty of accessing the crash site due to the terrain.
* **This directly points to the mountainous terrain as a contributing factor, or at least a significant aspect of the location of the crash.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nainget a dalan** (Hot weather) - While weather *could* be a factor, the passage specifically highlights the *location* (mountains) and mentions possible enemy fire.
* **B: Nauyong a puor** (Strong wind) - The passage doesn't mention wind.
* **D: Madi a panawen** (Bad time/season) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the time of year or season.



"
Ania a tipo ti daga a napasamak ti pannakadungpar?,"The correct answer is **D: Banbantay**.

The text states: ""Natnag ti helicopter iti **nangato a paset ti kabambatayan**..."" (The helicopter crashed in the higher part of the **mountains**...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nauyong** - This means ""flooded"" or ""swampy"" and isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Nainget** - This means ""hot"" and doesn't describe the terrain.
*   **C: Koalision** - This refers to the coalition troops, not the land itself.



"
Ania dagiti namnamaen dagiti mangituray a resulta ti layos?,"The correct answer is **D: Ad-adu pay a paggianan dagiti naatap nga animal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Napateg dagitoy nga arinsaed iti pannakaaramid dagiti namuntuon a darat ken dagiti aplaya, a nagpaay a pagnaedan dagiti atap a nabiag."" (These structures were important in creating artificial lands and beaches, providing habitat for aquatic life.)

This directly indicates the dams were intended to *increase* habitat and therefore populations of aquatic animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti pannakaurnos dagiti penned** - The passage doesn't mention penned areas.
* **B: Ti pannakaaramid dagiti beach** - While the passage mentions beaches being *created*, this isn't the primary intended *result* of the dams, it's a consequence. The goal was to provide habitat.
* **C: Ti panagngato ti bilang dagiti humpback chubs** - The passage states humpback chubs became *endangered*, not that their numbers were expected to increase.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti permanente nga apektaran ti pannakaaramid ti dam?,"The correct answer is **D: Panagwaras ti warang** (Flow of sediment).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kalpasan a naaramid ti dam idi 1963, nagsardeng dagiti layos a mangiwarwaras ti warang ti karayan."" (After the dam was built in 1963, the currents that spread river sediment stopped). This is a *direct* and *permanent* consequence of dam construction.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Dagiti buntuon ti darat (Sandbars)** - While the passage mentions hope for sandbar restoration (""mangnamnama a maisubli dagiti naiyanod a buntuon ti darat""), the dam *initially* caused their loss, and restoration isn't guaranteed to be permanent.
* **B: Dagiti humback chub (Humpback chub)** - The passage states the chub became endangered, but that's a *result* of the sediment flow being blocked, not the direct and permanent effect of the dam itself. The chub’s status could theoretically change with restoration efforts.
* **C: Pagnaedan dagiti atap a nabiag (Habitat of living things)** -  Habitat change is a consequence, but not the *direct* effect of the dam.  The direct effect is stopping the sediment.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D**."
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nangiyawat ti intel iti Estados Unidos maipapan kadagiti posible nga panangraut?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a saan a nainaganan a pammataudan** (An unnamed source).

The text specifically states the U.S. received information from a source they cannot disclose (""di mabalin nga ibaga ti nagtaudanna"").  This means the source is unnamed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti mammat-mati a Somali** (Somali extremists) - The text says the extremists are *planning* the attacks, not that they *provided* the intelligence.
* **B: Ti embahada ti Ethiopia** (The Ethiopian embassy) - The text doesn't mention the Ethiopian embassy as the source.
* **D: Maysa a pammataudan iti Kenya** (A source in Kenya) - While the embassy is *in* Kenya, the text doesn't specify the source is Kenyan. It only says the attacks are planned for Kenya *and* Ethiopia.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti maipagarup a plano dagiti extremist a mangraut?,"The correct answer is **B: Agpasabog kadagiti boma iti dua a pagilian**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the extremists are planning attacks in both Kenya *and* Ethiopia.**  This clearly indicates a plan involving two countries.
* Options A and D only mention one country.
* Option C refers to ""dulon"" (boundaries) which isn't the focus of the threat – the threat is attacks *within* the countries, not on their borders.



"
Siasino kadagiti sumaganad a tattao ti saan nga abogado?,"The correct answer is **D: Ni Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Ni Sakis Kechagioglou** is explicitly stated to be an abogado (lawyer).
* **Ni George Nikolakopoulos** is explicitly stated to be an abogado (lawyer).
* **Ni Petros Mantouvalos** is described as a ""miembro ti Parliamento ken abogado"" (member of Parliament and lawyer).
* **Ni Makis Triantafylopoulos** is identified as a ""journalista"" (journalist) working for ""Zoungla"" on Alpha TV.  He *reported* on the scandal, but is not described as being a lawyer himself.



"
Ania a grupo ti tattao ti saan a naisaad a paset ti eskandalo iti uneg ti legal a komunidad ti Griego?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti journalista**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions:

*   **Abogado:** Sakis Kechagioglou, George Nikolakopoulos, Petros Mantouvalos
*   **Ukom:** Evangelos Kalousis
*   **Solisitor:** Mentioned as part of the group involved in illegal activities.

However, the passage highlights a *journalist* (Makis Triantafylopoulos) as the one who *exposed* the scandal, not as a participant in it. Therefore, journalists are not identified as being part of the scandal itself.



"
Mano a wicket ti nakaabakan ti India?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""Ngem, kalpasan a maabakda iti captain's wicket, nakaaramid laeng ti India iti 36 a run a nakaabakanna iti **7 a wicket** tapno mapalpasna dagiti inning.""

Therefore, India lost 7 wickets after the captain's wicket."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kangatoan a puntos dagiti inning?","The correct answer is **A: 70 a taray**.

The passage states that Robin Uthappa scored a high of 70 runs off 41 balls. While other scores are mentioned, 70 is specifically identified as the *highest* score of the innings.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a gapu ti pannakakeltay ni Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **D: Ulbod maipapan iti makagapu iti pannakaikkat ti arte** (Concerns about what could lead to the removal of art).

Here's why:

The passage states Cuerden expressed relief *at* the removals, and then outlines two reasons Wales (likely referring to Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia/Wikimedia) made the removals:

1.  A legal reason.
2.  Wales listened to concerns until the art was removed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti baro a polisiya ti site maipapan ti seksual a linaon** (The new site policy regarding sexual content) - The passage states the removals are *leading* to discussion about a law regarding sexual content, not that a new policy *caused* the removals.
*   **B: Pannaka-ikkat ti artes iti Wales** (Removal of art by Wales) - Cuerden is relieved *about* Wales removing the art, not upset by it.
*   **C: Saan a denggen ti Wales** (Wales doesn't listen) - The passage explicitly states Wales *did* listen (""agingga a naikkat ti inaramidna nga art"").

The passage focuses on Cuerden's relief that Wales took action and the broader discussion spurred by the removals *regarding the future* of art and potential legal issues. This aligns with option D: Cuerden’s relief is connected to addressing concerns about what factors might lead to art being removed in the future.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti naikkat manipud ti site?","The correct answer is **A: Art**.

The passage specifically states that Adam Cuerden mentioned art being removed (""...agingga a naikkat ti inaramidna nga art.""). The other options are discussed in the context of *why* things might be removed (sexual content, policy drafts, media companies), but art is the specific thing stated as being removed.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a supsuportaran ni Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Panangiraman kadagiti tagalaban a babbai iti Olympics**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan believes ""women simply shouldn’t compete."" This directly indicates he *doesn't* support including women in competitions. While he says he'll support British athletes at the 2012 Olympics, his core belief, as stated, is against women competing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti kalaban a Britianio:** He explicitly states he *will* support British competitors.
*   **C: Dagiti makuna ti babbai:** The passage doesn't mention his opinion on what women say.
*   **D: Ti panag-host ti London ti Olympics:** The passage doesn't mention his opinion on London hosting the Olympics.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti suportaranto ni Amir Khan malaksid ti personal nga opinionna?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti babbai a tagalaban**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Amir Khan believes women ""should not fight.""** This directly contradicts supporting female fighters. While he *says* he'll support British athletes at the 2012 Olympics (including women), his personal opinion is against women competing in combat sports.
* **B, C, and D are not mentioned as being *not* supported by Amir Khan.** The passage focuses specifically on his contradictory stance regarding women fighters. He would support his fellow 2004 Olympians, the 2012 Olympics, and other silver medalists.



"
Kaano a natay ni Peter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: Iti ospital**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagus nga inasikado isuna dagiti sumursurot a kameng ti medikal sa naitaray iti lokal nga ospital a nakatayannan."" (He was immediately attended to by medical personnel and taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayat ti warm-up a lap:** He *crashed* during the warm-up lap, but didn't die *during* it.
* **B: Kalpasan a natinnag isuna ti bisikletana:** Again, this describes *how* he was injured, not *when* he died.
* **D: Bayat a kaduana ti on-track a medikal nga empleado:** The medical employees tried to save him, but he died at the hospital.



"
Siasino ni Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa pay a kumarkarera**.

The passage states: ""...napilidan ti kaduana nga agkarkarera a ni Xavier Zayat."" This directly translates to ""...hit fellow racer Xavier Zayat."" 

Therefore, Xavier Zayat is also a racer."
Iti ania a kasasaad a posible a magunggonaan ti madandanagan nga agtaytayab no maawatanna ti makin-uneg a panagandar ti eroplano?,"The correct answer is **B: No ti aversion ti panagtayab ket nakasentro iti butengda ti saanda nga ammo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ti panangawat no kasano nga umandar ti eroplano ken no ania ti mapaspasamak bayat ti panagtayab ket mabalin a makaparmek ti panagbuteng a naggapu iti awan wenno kinaawan ti kontrol."" This directly links anxiety during flight to a lack of understanding of *how* the plane works and what to expect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No ti pasahero ket mabain iti butengda:** While being brave is helpful, the passage focuses on *knowledge* alleviating fear, not inherent bravery.
* **C: No ti pasahero ket nakaniwas kadagiti amin a tipo ti transportasion:**  Avoiding all transportation doesn't address the specific fear of flying and understanding how it works.
* **D: No ti panagdanagda ket agtaud kadagiti makapadanag a pasamak a di nainaig iti panagtayab:** This refers to anxieties stemming from unrelated traumatic events, not the fear of flight itself.



"
"Base iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti rumbeng nga aramiden ti maysa a agbi-biahe a sipapanunot iti presio?","The correct answer is **C: Mangiyasping kadagiti presio ti adu a kompania ti panagbiahe** (Compare prices of many airlines).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travelers should *not* just stick to one airline, and that comparing prices across different aggregators *and* airline websites is beneficial. This means actively looking at and comparing the prices offered by multiple airlines is the most sensible thing a price-conscious traveler should do.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Agbirok kadagiti diaya dagiti adu a kompania ti panagbiahe** (Search for different airlines) - While searching is *part* of the process, the passage emphasizes *comparing* the prices found.
*   **B: Direkta nga ag-book iti kompania ti eroplano** (Book directly with the airline) - The passage suggests this isn’t always the best option, as prices can vary.
*   **D: Kitaen ti website ti airline** (Check the airline website) -  Again, checking airline websites is *part* of the process, but it’s not the whole thing. You also need to compare with aggregators.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti kasapulan nga umuna nga aramiden dagiti agbi-biahe tapno maala dagiti kamayatan a presio ti flight?","The correct answer is **B: Iyasping dagiti presion dagiti agduduma nga aggregator**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states that travelers should **compare search results** and check airline websites *before* booking, implying the need to look at multiple sources, including aggregators. It also points out that sometimes aggregators have better prices than booking directly with the airline.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kitaen ti website ti airline:** While the passage suggests *eventually* checking the airline website, it's not the *first* step. Comparison is key first.
* **C: Direkta nga ag-book babaen ti airline:** The passage cautions against *only* booking directly with the airline, as prices may be higher.
* **D: Direkta nga ag-book iti travel agent:** The passage doesn’t mention travel agents at all.



"
Kaano a kasapulan ti kadua a kumuyog iti delivery?,"The correct answer is **C: No dagiti banbanag ket maipatulod kas mai-check a bagahe.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti pamay-an laeng tapno makalasat a nadardaras ket ti panangipatulod kadagitoy kas nailista a bagahe. Ti linteg ti eroplano saanda a palubosan dagitoy nga ipaw-it dagiti bagahe nga awan pasaherona, ket kadagitoy a situasionka a sumrek.""  This means to get things delivered quickly via air, they need to be checked baggage *which requires a passenger to accompany them* because airlines don't allow unaccompanied checked baggage.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: No dagiti banbanag ket naipatulod babaen ti air freight:** Air freight is specifically mentioned as being *slow* due to customs and transit times.
*   **B: No mangusar ti kompania kadagiti bukodda nga eroplano:** This is only a solution for large companies and doesn't address the problem of slow delivery for others.
*   **D: No ti panangipaw-it ket iggem ti dakdakkel a kompania:** This doesn't relate to the need for a companion during delivery."
"Segun iti mabasa, no agpilpila ti Frequent Flyer nga airline iti alyansa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulam a kitaen nga umuna?","The correct answer is **C: Ti airline a masansan nga usarem para ti biahem**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even if joining is easy, you need to be aware that *privileges and points can differ* between airlines within the same alliance.  Therefore, the most important thing to consider when choosing a Frequent Flyer program is the airline you *regularly fly with*. This will allow you to accumulate and redeem points more effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti airline a mangidiay-diaya ti kaaduan a puntos** - While attractive, points differences within an alliance make this less important.
*   **B: Ti airline iti kadakkelan nga alyansa** - The size of the alliance isn't the key factor; the benefits *you* receive are.
*   **D: Ti airline a mabalin a manginayon kadagiti pribileheo** - This is a benefit, but not the primary consideration for choosing an airline to focus your loyalty on.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti makaidiaya ti ad-adu a frequent flyer a puntos?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a sabali nga airline iti uneg ti agpada nga alyansa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent flyer privileges and points earned with one airline *can* be redeemed with another airline *within the same alliance*. This means you can benefit from joining a different airline *within the same alliance* to maximize your points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a sabali nga airline iti sabali nga alyansa** - The passage specifically talks about airlines *within* the same alliance.
* **B: Ti airline a masansan a nausarmo para ti biahem babaen ti agpada nga alyansa** - While staying with your usual airline is good, the passage suggests exploring options *within* the alliance for better redemption.
* **C: Ti airline a masansan a nausarmo para ti biahem iti sabali nga alyansa** - Again, the passage focuses on airlines within the *same* alliance.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pangrikna ti mabalin a madadael ti sobra a panaginum ti arak?","The correct answer is **C: Panagraman (Liver)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Dagiti posible a nabayag a pasamak para iti salun-at aggapu iti sobra a panaginom iramanna ti **pannakadadael ti dalem**..."" (Possible long-term health consequences from excessive drinking include **liver damage**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagdengngeg (Hearing)** - The text doesn't mention anything about hearing.
*   **B: Panagkita (Vision)** - While methanol poisoning *can* cause blindness, the general statement about excessive drinking doesn't mention vision problems.
*   **D: Panagangut (Brain)** - While alcohol affects the brain, the text focuses on liver damage as a long-term consequence.



"
"Kas naisaad iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a makakissay kadagiti delikado nga epekto ti arak?","The correct answer is **B: Panaginum ti ilegal a naaramid nga arak**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Posible a peggadna ket ngumato no uminom ti alkohol nga ilegal a naaramid. Dagiti ilegal nga arak ket mabalin a naaddaan iti nadumaduma a makadakes a rugit karaman ti methanol..."" (The risk increases if you drink illegally made alcohol. Illegally made alcohol may contain various dangerous ingredients including methanol...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panaginum ti arak nga addaan ti methanol:** While methanol is dangerous, the passage focuses on *where* you find methanol - in illegally made alcohol.
*   **C: Panaginum ti arak a kalalainganna:** The passage mentions excessive drinking in general as harmful, but doesn't specifically link it to *increased* danger beyond the general risks.
*   **D: Panaginum kadua dagiti sabali a tattao:** The passage doesn't mention anything about drinking with others increasing the risk.



"
Sadinno a makita ti kangatoan a pateg ti tagikua iti Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Canal District**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ti pateg dagiti sanikuana ket maysa kadagiti kangangatuan ti nasion"" *referring to* ""Ti Canal District."" This directly links the highest value of possessions/heritage to the Canal District.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iti aniaman a lugar a naidutok kas UNESCO World Heritage Site:** While being a UNESCO site is important, the passage specifically highlights the Canal District's value *within* Amsterdam.
* **C: Dagiti lugar a naikkat manipud ti Binnestad:** The passage states the Canal District is *within* Binnenstad, but doesn't say all of Binnenstad holds the highest value.
* **D: Dagiti lugar nga addaan ti historikal a pateg:**  Historical value is important, but the passage pinpoints the Canal District as having particularly high value.



"
Apay a naibilang ti Canal District kas maysa a UNESCO World Heritage Site?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti historikal ken kultural a pategna**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti entero a distrito ket naibilang nga UNESCO World Heritage Site **para iti naidumduma a kultural ket historikal a pategna**..."" (The entire district is considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site **for its diverse cultural and historical value**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti naidumduma a sanikuana** - While the canals are important, the passage says the *value* of the canals contributes to the national treasures, but doesn't state it's the reason for the UNESCO designation.
*   **C: Ti lokasionna ket aglawlaw ti Binnestad** - Location is mentioned, but it's not the primary reason for the UNESCO recognition.
*   **D: Ti nangato a pateg ti sanikuana** - Similar to B, the high value of the canals is a result of its cultural and historical importance, not the reason *why* it's a UNESCO site.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangpapateg ti panagbisita iti Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Ti buya iti rabaw ti Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ti naliday a tangatang ti templo ken **ti buya idiay dan-aw iti Tonle Sap** ket mangaramid a makagungona ti panaguli ti turod."" (The serene atmosphere of the temple and **the view of Tonle Sap Lake** make the trip worthwhile.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagbiahe babaen ti Angkor Pass:** While the passage mentions needing an Angkor Pass, it doesn't say it *makes* the visit worthwhile, only that you need it.
* **C: Panangkita ti Siem Reap:** Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but the passage doesn't focus on seeing Siem Reap itself.
* **D: Ti biahe babaen ti balangay paapan ti dan-aw:** The passage mentions it can be conveniently combined with a boat trip, but doesn't say the boat trip *itself* is what makes the visit special.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maikasapulan kadagiti bisita tapno makastrek iti Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Panangala ti Angkor Pass**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti Angkor Pass ti kasapulam no umunegka iti templo..."" which translates to ""The Angkor Pass is required if you enter the temple...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panaguli iti templo ti Yasovarman** - While Phnom Krom *is* the Yasovarman temple, the passage doesn't state you need to *climb* it to enter.
* **B: Panagbiahe iti lawlaw ti Siem Reap** - The passage mentions Phnom Krom is 12km southwest of Siem Reap, but doesn't say you need to travel *through* Siem Reap.
* **D: Panagbalangay iti lawlaw ti Tonle Sap** - While visiting Phnom Krom can be combined with a boat trip on Tonle Sap, it's not a *requirement* to enter the temple.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mangliklik iti maysa a turista a bisitaen ti Antartica?","The correct answer is **D: Limitado a pisikal a panaggaraw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nangina dagiti panagbisita dagiti turista, makasapul iti pisikal a kinasalun-at..."" (Tourist visits are limited, requiring physical health...). This directly indicates that a tourist needs to be physically fit to visit Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti nangina unay a gasto (The very high cost)** - While Antarctica trips are likely expensive, the passage doesn't mention cost as a limiting factor.
*   **B: Ti interes iti panangsukisok ti Ross Sea (Interest in researching the Ross Sea)** - The passage mentions the Ross Sea as a place to visit, but doesn't say research interest is a requirement or limiting factor.
*   **C: Ti iskediul ti trabaho a mangpalubos ti panagbiahe iti Disiembre ken Enero (A work schedule that allows travel in December and January)** - The passage states travel is possible from November-February, but doesn't mention work schedules.



"
Ti maysa a turista nga interesado iti panaguli ti bantay ket mabalin a bumisita iti ania a paset ti Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti Inland a paset ti lugar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dagiti sagpaminsan nga espesialista a tour ti tangatang ket agdissaag, para iti panaguli iti bantay wenno tapno mapan iti Pole, nga addaan ti dakkel a base."" This directly links mountain climbing tours to the *inland* part of Antarctica where mountains exist under the ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti Ross Sea:** The text mentions the Ross Sea as a general area for visits, but doesn't specify mountain climbing.
*   **C: Ti Peninsula:** The text says tourism is *mainly* limited to the Peninsula, islands, and Ross Sea - it doesn't say mountain climbing happens there.
*   **D: Dagiti Isla:** Same as the Peninsula, islands are mentioned as tourist destinations, but not for mountain climbing.



"
Sadinno a saan unay a makita dagiti pre-modern observatory?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti nalaka laeng a maakses a lugar**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gapu ta iti nalag-an a polusion idi panawenda ket saan a ti tipo iti problema a kas itatta, gagangay a mabirukan isuda kadagiti siudad ken kampus..."" (Because light pollution wasn't a problem like it is today, they were commonly found in cities and on campuses...). This means pre-modern observatories were *easily accessible* – in cities and on campuses, not remote locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iti sentro ti siudad:** While they *could* be in cities, the passage also mentions campuses, making 'easily accessible' a broader and more accurate answer.
* **C: Iti adayo a lugar:**  The passage directly contrasts this with the location of pre-modern observatories. Modern observatories are in remote locations *because* of light pollution.
* **D: Kadagiti campus ti kolehiyo:**  This is a location mentioned, but it doesn't capture the full scope of accessibility – they were also in cities.



"
Sadino ti posible a pakaikabilan ti moderno a teleskopio ti panagsukisok?,"The correct answer is **D: Iti maysa a dakkel a pasilidad**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kaaduan dagiti moderno a teleskopio a pangsarsarak ket dadakkel a pasilidad iti nasulimek a lugar..."" (Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in remote areas...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti maysa a museo:** The passage says older observatories *became* museums, not that modern telescopes are *in* museums.
* **B: Iti maysa a campus ti unibersidad:** The passage says older observatories were *found* on campuses, but modern ones are in remote locations.
* **C: Iti maysa nga edukasional a site:** While research contributes to education, the key factor for modern telescopes is a remote, dark location.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a lugar ti kasayaatan para ti naulimek nga aldaw iti beach?","The correct answer is **B: Ti Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the beaches along Tamaki Drive (including Mission Bay and St Heliers) are often crowded with families and have good facilities lined along the shore. This suggests they are popular choices for a beach day.
*   While St Heliers is mentioned, the passage describes both Mission Bay and St Heliers as being similar in their appeal to families.
*   North Harbor District and Waitemata Harbor are broader locations, not specific beaches known for being busy.

Therefore, based on the text, **Mission Bay** is the best answer as it's specifically mentioned as a popular, well-equipped beach."
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a katalgedan dagiti kondision ti panaglangoy?","The correct answer is **C: Ti Central Auckland**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""No maminsan ket mapuspusek ti pamilia dagitoy nga aplaya nga adda ti nasayaat a paggatangan a nakalinia iti igid baybay. **Natalged met iti panaglangoy.**"" This refers to the beaches along Tamaki Drive, which are located in Central Auckland (Mission Bay and St Heliers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti Devonport:** While Devonport has beaches, the passage doesn't specifically say the swimming conditions are good there.
*   **B: Ti North Harbor District:** The passage only mentions the location of the beaches (Pacific Ocean), but not specifically the quality of the swimming.
*   **D: Ti Long Bay:** Long Bay is mentioned as a northern point, but there's no detail about swimming conditions.



"
"Bayat ti panagbisita iti lugar a nailadawan iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maikonsiderar a saan a naannatup?","The correct answer is **B: Panagikabil ti marka sadinno man iti lawlaw ti site**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Saanmo a dadaelen dayta lugar ti panangikabilmo ti marka wenno panagkarmot mo iti graffiti kadagita naipatakder."" (Do not defile the place by leaving a mark or scratching graffiti on its structures.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagbalin nga ulimek (Being silent/quiet):** The passage emphasizes respect and dignity, which aligns with being quiet and contemplative.  It's likely *expected* to be silent.
* **C: Panagangaw (Talking/Discussing):** The passage specifically says ""Saan kayo nga agangaw maipapan iti Holocaust wenno kadagiti Nazi"" (Do not talk about the Holocaust or the Nazis), but that's a prohibition *about what* you discuss, not necessarily that talking itself is disrespectful.
* **D: Panagkudkud ti istruktura (Damaging the structure):**  While damaging the structure would be incredibly disrespectful, the passage doesn't specifically mention this, focusing instead on markings and graffiti.



Therefore, leaving a mark on the site is the most direct violation of the explicit instruction in the passage."
Ania kadagitoy ti mangiladawan kadagiti lengguahe a lingua franca?,"The correct answer is **D: Organiko**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *lingua francas* are ""gagangay wenno **organiko** a pagsasao nga agbalbalin a dominante..."" (spontaneous or **organic** languages that become dominant...).  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Artipisial** - The passage contrasts auxiliary languages (often artificial) *with* lingua francas, which are organic.
* **B: Saan a natural** - Lingua francas *are* natural languages that happen to become widespread.
* **C: Naaramid** - While a lingua franca might be *used* deliberately in a situation, the language itself isn't created for that purpose; it arises organically.



"
Ania a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan kadagiti auxiliary a legguahe?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagita ket naaramid a lengguahe a kangrunaan kadagiti agsasao ti agduduma a lengguahe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** that auxiliary languages are *artificial or transformed languages* intended to *ease communication between people who have difficulty speaking to each other*.  Option D directly reflects this definition - they are *made languages primarily for speakers of different languages*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isuda ket organiko a lengguahe a mausar tapno makikomunikar kadagiti tattao a mabalin a saan a makaawat ti maysa ken maysa** - The passage contrasts auxiliary languages *with* organic languages like lingua francas. Auxiliary languages are *not* organic.
* **B: Dagita ket pagsasao nga agpada a natural ken naaramid** - This is contradictory. Auxiliary languages are *defined* by being artificial (made) and not purely natural.
* **C: Dagita ket lengguahe a naaramid tapno mapasayaat dagiti kasasaad ti komunikasion** - While improving communication *is* the goal, this is too broad. Many things can improve communication. Option D specifies *how* they improve communication - by bridging language barriers.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a kitaen ti pasahero iti barko iti panawen ti niebe?","The correct answer is **A: Lokasion ti cabin**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...kitaen iti lugar ti kabin, gapu ta iti panagpagna iti yelo ket makingapu iti nakaro a tagari para kadagidiay maapektaran."" ( ""...check the location of the cabin, because the icing of ice can cause a large tagari for those affected."") This means passengers need to be aware of their cabin location due to potential icing issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti kasapulan iti visa (Visa requirements):** The text states passengers *don't* need a visa.
*   **C: Dagiti termino (Terms):** While the text mentions terms of cruise, it doesn't say passengers need to check them.
*   **D: Ti kaadu ti panawen a mabusbos iti ili (The amount of time spent in the city):** The text states the time in St. Petersburg is limited, but doesn't ask passengers to check it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, no ti biahe ti barko ti pasahero ket iti panawen ti kalgaw, ania ti mabalin a kasapulanda a liklikan?","The correct answer is **B: Panaglasat iti yelo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in the summer (lam-ek), the Northern Baltic is navigable, but the formation of ice (panagpagna iti yelo) creates a significant hazard for those affected. This implies that during other times of the year, ice is a problem to *avoid*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oras iti ili** - The passage states cruises have *limited* time in St. Petersburg, not that they need to avoid it.
*   **C: Dagiti kasapulan iti visa** - The passage specifically says passengers *don't* need a visa.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg** - The passage doesn't suggest avoiding St. Petersburg.



"
Apay a masansan a mausar ti Catalan para kadagiti sinyal ken anunsio iti Barcelona,"The correct answer is **B: Daytoy ti umuna nga opisial a lengguahe ti siudad**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngem kaadduan kadagiti karatula ket nakasurat ti Catalan gapu ta isu daytoy ti naipasdek iti linteg nga umuna nga opisial a pagsasao."" (But most signs are written in Catalan because it was decreed by law as the first official language.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ad-adu ti makaawat ngem ti Espaniol:** The passage says *most* prefer to speak Catalan, and *almost all* understand Spanish. It doesn't state that more *understand* Catalan than Spanish.
*   **C: Daytoy ti maipangpangruna a lengguahe iti Barcelona:** While many prefer it, the passage doesn't say it's the *main* language. Spanish is also widely used.
*   **D: Ti Metro ken dagiti dadduma pay a publiko a pasilidad ket masansan nga us-usaren dagiti umuli nga agsasao ti Catalan:** The passage doesn't focus on *who* uses the facilities, but rather *why* the signs are in Catalan.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a legguahe ti nausar ti sistema ti Metro iti Barcelona para kadagiti regular nga anunsio?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti regular a pammakdaar idiay Metro ket maaramid laeng idiay Catalan..."" which translates to ""Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan..."" 

While the system *automatically* announces in multiple languages during disruptions, *regular* announcements are specifically in Catalan.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagnam-ayan ti saan a nalabit nga ipangpangruna ti high end bed and breakfast?","The correct answer is **D: Napartak a WiFi**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on luxury B&Bs emphasizing *experience* – deluxe accommodations, food, and ambiance. It specifically mentions:

*   **Pagiddaan (Accommodation):** High-quality beds, maybe with unique designs.
*   **Pammigat (Food):** Local, regional cuisine or home-cooked meals.
*   **Ambiance:** Old structures, well-kept grounds, and pools.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned or implied:

*   **A: Dagiti banbanag ti espesialidad iti menu (Specialties on the menu):** The passage *does* mention good food, but it doesn't frame it as a primary focus of a high-end B&B. It’s *part* of the experience, not the defining feature.
*   **B: Dagiti naidumduma nga antique a muebles (Various antique furniture):** The passage explicitly states antique beds or furnishings are possible, meaning it is a feature.
*   **C: Dagiti nasayaat a namentenar nga espasio iti ruar (Well-maintained outdoor spaces):** The passage mentions well-kept grounds and a pool, also meaning it is a feature.

**WiFi**, however, isn't mentioned *at all* in the passage. It's a modern convenience, but the passage concentrates on the more traditional elements that make a B&B ""deluxe"" or artful. Therefore, it's the element *least* likely to be a focus.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that B&Bs compete primarily on **accommodation (pagiddaan)** and **food (pammigat)**.  It describes desirable accommodation as having ""kapipintasan a pagiddaan"" (quality accommodation), perhaps with antique furniture.  It highlights regional and homemade food as important for the dining experience.  Local food and seasonal breakfast options are directly mentioned.

However, the passage *doesn't* mention contemporary decoration as a key competitive factor. It leans towards describing an aesthetic of antiquity and traditional style (""antigo a disenio"").

Therefore:

*   **B** is mentioned (seasonal breakfast)
*   **C** is mentioned (nangina a pagiddaan – quality accommodation)
*   **D** is mentioned (lokal a naala a makan ken mainum – locally sourced food and drink)
*   **A** is *not* mentioned as a key competition point.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maangay iti Beijing idi 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti pasamak ti ski iti lugar ti Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ski events will be held in the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, which is *220 km from Beijing*. This means they will not be held *in* Beijing.

The passage also states that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies, and indoor ice events."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti i-host ti Beijing idi 2022?","Ti correct answer ket **B: Dagiti pasamak ti yelo a mapasamak iti uneg**.

* **C: Ti Olympics iti panawen ti niebe** - Katulad iti A, Winter Olympics iti mang-host ti Beijing.

Siasino ti addaan ti kangatoan a peggad ti panagsakit ti avian influenza?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti empleado iti manukan** (Poultry workers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaaduanna nga inramanda dagiti tao nga agob-obra iti pagtaraknan ti manok..."" (Most of the people infected work in poultry farms...). This directly links poultry workers to a higher risk of infection.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Dagiti birdwatcher** (Birdwatchers) - The passage mentions occasional infections from wild birds, but it's not the primary risk group.
*   **B: Dagiti tattao a makitar-tarabaho kadagiti mammal** (People who work with mammals) - The passage does state it can affect mammals, but doesn't highlight workers with mammals as a primary risk.
*   **D: Dagiti tattao a naimpeksionan idin** (People who have been infected before) - This doesn't relate to who is *at risk* of getting the disease in the first place.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti bird flu?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti birdwatcher ket adda ti peggad a maimpeksionan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...adda latta met sumagmamano a pagpeggadan dagiti agbuybuya iti bilbillit."" ( ""...there are also some infections among birdwatchers."") This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti laeng empleado iti manukan ti nakaala ti trangkaso** - The passage says most cases are in poultry workers (""Kaaduanna nga inramanda dagiti tao nga agob-obra iti pagtaraknan ti manok""), but also mentions birdwatchers get infected.
* **B: Ad-adu a kaso ti naipadamag kadagiti tattao ngem kadagiti billet** - The passage doesn't compare the number of cases in people versus birds.
* **D: Amin a kaso a naipadamag kadagiti tattao ket makapatay** - The passage states that *some* cases are fatal (""ti dadduma kadagitoy ket makapatay""), not all.



"
Ania ti ikonektar ti White Sea–Baltic Canal?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti Artic Ocean ken Baltic Sea**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti White Sea–Baltic Canal ket konektado iti Arctic ocean ken iti Balctic Sea..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti Black Sea ken Caspian Sea:** While the Vikings *used* waterways to reach these seas, the canal itself doesn't directly connect them.
* **B: Ti Lake Onega ken River Volga:** The passage mentions these are *part of the route* the canal uses, but they aren't what the canal connects *to*.
* **D: Ti Southern Ocean ken Red Sea:** The passage makes no mention of these.

"Segun iti mabasa, iti ania a tipo ti lugan ti mabalin a makolekta dagiti passport tapno saanen a masinga ti pasahero?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti mabalin a turugan iti rabii a tren**.

The passage specifically states: ""Kadagiti tren a mabalin pagturogan iti rabii, mabalin a kolektaen ti konduktor dagiti pasaporte tapno saan a maistorbo ti panagturogmo.""  (In trains where you can sleep at night, the conductor may collect passports so as not to disturb your sleep.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti eroplano** - The passage mentions checkpoints at airports, but not passport collection *during* the journey.
*   **C: Dagiti barko** - The passage mentions ships, but not passport collection on them.
*   **D: Dagiti cross-border a tren** - The passage states IDs are *required* for inspection on these trains, not that passports are collected for safekeeping.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a mabalin a mainspektar ti bukodmo nga ID iti sumagmamano a cross-border a tren?","The correct answer is **D: Iti agtar-taray a tren**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kadagiti dadduma a tren para iti panagballasiw iti border iti panag-inspeksiyon ket maaramid no madama nga agtartaray ti tren isu a masapul nga adda payso nga ID no agluganka iti kasdiay a tren."" This directly translates to ""Sometimes, border crossing trains are inspected while moving, so you need a valid ID if you travel on those trains.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kalpasan a madisembarko manipud ti tren:** The passage doesn't mention inspection *after* disembarking.
*   **B: Bayat ti panagturog mo:** While passports *can* be collected while sleeping, this isn't about an inspection happening then. It's to avoid disturbance.
*   **C: Saan a mainspektar daytoy:** The passage explicitly states inspections *do* happen on some trains.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti masansan a parikut bayat ti panagtalinaed kadagiti nangato a tropiko a lugar ti Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Pannakabannog manipud ti init** (Heatstroke).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...masapul ti pannakasanaymo iti agpada a pudot (kanayon) ken napigsa nga init (no nalayang ti tangatang, nga ad-adda a manmano)."" - This directly points to the danger of intense heat.  Heatstroke (pannakabannog) is a serious and potentially fatal condition caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matakawan (Theft):** The passage doesn't mention anything about crime or theft.
* **B: Awan ti akses kadagiti paggatangan (Lack of access to goods):** The passage states you can ""get anything you want after you arrive"" which contradicts this option.
* **D: Pannakapukaw (Getting lost):**  While possible in any new place, the passage doesn't highlight getting lost as a specific risk in Singapore's tropical climate.



"
Siasino ti mabalin a mayat a mangliklik iti pannangan kadagiti German a pastry?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a tao nga ipangpangrunana dagiti richer a dessert**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes German pastries as flavorful, often including fruits, nuts, and paired with coffee.** This suggests they are richer and more indulgent than simple fare.
* **Option A** is incorrect because many German pastries contain nuts (almonds, hazelnuts).
* **Option C** isn't necessarily true; the passage doesn't mention a lack of chocolate, just focuses on fruit and nut flavors.
* **Option D** is incorrect. The passage mentions options for ""a bit less substantial"" pastries (Berliner, Pfannkuchen, Krapfen) but primarily focuses on the richer, more elaborate ones.



"
Ania kadagiti laok ti maikonsiderar a base ti panawen nga elemento dagiti tinapay iti German?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti mansanas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gagangayen dagiti tinapay nga adda prutasna, kas kadagiti **mansanas a mailutluto kadagiti tinapay** iti sibubukel a tawen...""  This directly links apples to being a seasonal element in German breads, used throughout the year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti hazelnut** - While hazelnuts are *in* some German breads, the text doesn't indicate they are tied to a specific season.
* **C: Dagiti sarguelas** - Cherries and plums are mentioned, but specifically as appearing *during* autumn (kalagaw), making them seasonal fruits *used in* breads, not the base of a seasonal element *of* the bread itself.
* **D: Dagiti almond** -  Almonds are simply listed as an ingredient, not as being tied to a particular season.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalikagum a singasing para ti panagbiahe nga addaan ti budget?","The correct answer is **C: Agkiddaw ti kuarta manipud kadagiti tattao**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the approach to low-budget travel *assumes travelers will not steal, get into trouble, engage in shady business, beg, or exploit others for personal gain.*  Asking for money from people (agkiddaw ti kuarta) falls directly into the category of exploitation and begging that the passage rejects as a valid method for low-budget travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agbirok kadagiti naisalumina a trabaho nga aramidem bayat ti panagbiahem** (Finding odd jobs to do while traveling) - This is a legitimate way to offset travel costs.
*   **B: Agbalin a nalap-it iti lebel ti kiinakomportablem** (Becoming closer to the level of discomfort) - Accepting a lower level of comfort (like staying in hostels or eating simple food) is a common strategy for budget travel.
*   **D: Kissayan dagiti gasto para ti makan ken pagturugan** (Reducing costs for food and lodging) -  This is the core of low-budget travel, as stated in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti mabalin a marigatan iti panagbiahe no bassit laeng ti budget?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a tao nga addaan kadagiti istrikto a limitasion iti oras.**

Here's why:

The passage states that low-budget travel requires sacrificing ""gin-awa, oras ken mapadlesan a panagiduron ti gastos."" This directly translates to sacrificing comfort, **time**, and aggressively reducing costs.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a tao a mangpasangbay ti karit** - The passage assumes travelers are *not* resorting to theft or dangerous activities.
* **C: Mays a tao nga agtar-tarabaho iti remote bayat ti panagbiahe** - While remote work can help with finances, it's not mentioned as a barrier to low-budget travel in the passage.
* **D: Maysa a tao a mangipapas a mangsurot iti itinerario** -  Flexibility isn't specifically mentioned as being difficult when traveling on a tight budget.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagmaneho iti baet ti Point Marion ken Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti serbisio ti cellphone ket saan a parikut**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""napigpigsa ti serbisio ti mobile a telepono ditoy ngem iti adu a sabali a distansia ti ruta..."" (the mobile phone service is *stronger* here than in many other distances of the route). This directly contradicts the statement that cellphone service is a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Adda dagiti adayo nga atiddog a dalan iti pagilian** (There are long and winding country roads) - The passage mentions ""nailet a daldalan"" (winding roads) and describes navigating ""naisinsina nga aw-away a daga"" (rough, uneven terrain), indicating country roads.
* **B: Dagiti linia ket naet-et** (The lines are faded) - The passage explicitly states ""nailet a daldalan"" (winding roads), implying poor road markings.
* **C: Dagiti limitasion ti kapartak ket manmano a masurot** (Speed limits are carefully followed) -  The passage says ""nakaim-importante ti panangsurot kadagitoy"" (it is important to follow them) and specifically mentions the lower speed limits (35-40 mph).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makaupay ti nabattag a trapiko** - The passage doesn't mention traffic conditions being good.
* **B: Awan ti naan-anay a cellular a serbisio** - The passage actually says the opposite: ""napigpigsa ti serbisio ti mobile a telepono ditoy ngem iti adu a sabali a distansia ti ruta."" (mobile service is *stronger* here)
* **D: Pannakasagang kadagiti masansan a trabaho iti dalan** - The passage doesn't mention road work.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kasapulan tapno makarugi iti canyoneering?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti kapabilidad a lumagto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti Kanyoning ket mangtiptipon dagiti elemento aggapu iti panaglangoy, panagkalay-at ken panagtapuak--ngem **masapul ti bassit a panagsanaywenno kinaalibtak ti bagi tapno mangrugi**"".  

This means canyoneering requires *some* training or physical fitness, but doesn't explicitly require the ability to jump (lumagto). The passage focuses on swimming, climbing, and rappelling as core skills. While jumping *might* be part of some canyoneering routes, it's not a fundamental requirement to *begin*.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti abilidad a makalangoy** - The passage explicitly mentions swimming as an element of canyoneering.
*   **B: Ti kasalun-atan a pisikal a kondision** - The passage implies physical fitness is important (""kinaalibtak ti bagi"").
*   **D: Ti bassit a panagsanay** - The passage states some training is needed to start.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulan para ti naballigi a canyoning excursion?,"The correct answer is **D: Abilidad a makalangoy**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti Kanyoning ket mangtiptipon dagiti elemento aggapu iti panaglangoy..."" (Kanyoning combines elements from swimming...). This directly indicates that swimming is a core component of the activity.
* **The passage also says:** ""...masapul ti bassit a panagsanaywenno kinaalibtak ti bagi tapno mangrugi"" (requires a little training or physical fitness to start). While physical fitness is helpful, it doesn't specify *advanced* athleticism.
* **The passage contrasts canyoneering with scuba diving and alpine skiing**, implying it's less demanding in terms of prior certification or experience.  Scuba diving experience (B) is therefore not a *requirement*.
* **While a canyoneering certification (C) might be beneficial, the passage doesn't state it's *necessary* to begin.**

Therefore, the most basic and essential requirement mentioned for canyoneering is the ability to swim.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong para ti maysa a tao nga agplan-plano nga agkampo iti luganda?","The correct answer is **B: Ti lugan a mangpalubos kadagiti tugaw a maitumba.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti panagkampo ti lugan ket mabalin no adda iti dakkel a minivan, SUV, Sedan wenno Station Wagonmo nga agidda dagiti tugawna."" (Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon that *allows its seats to be folded down*).  This directly indicates that having a vehicle where the seats can be folded down to create space is essential for car camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti nasayaat a pannakaawat kadagiti limitasion ti lugan mo** - While understanding your vehicle's limitations is *generally* good, the passage specifically focuses on the *ability* to fold down seats for space.
* **C: Maysa a tolda** - The passage doesn't mention a tent as a requirement for car camping; it's about sleeping *in* the vehicle.
* **D: Maysa a pribado a tagikua a pagkampuan** - The passage mentions a private area to travel, but doesn't specifically state you need a designated campsite.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a liklikan dagiti agkampo iti lugan no mangkitkitada ti lugar a nalaka a mabirukan?","The correct answer is **C: Panagiyasmang ti tolda iti ili wenno iti pribado a tagikua**.

Here's why:

The passage states that setting up a car/camp in a private property or a small town can attract unwanted attention. This implies that **avoiding** camping in these easily-found locations is a good practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagmaneho ti dakdakkel a lugan, kas ti SUV wenno minivan** - The passage *mentions* these vehicles are suitable for car camping, but doesn't say to *avoid* them.
*   **B: Panagbiahe iti nabaybayag** - The passage contrasts short trips (where a car is fine) with making car camping a lifestyle. It doesn't suggest avoiding longer trips.
*   **D: Saan a naruam iti lugan nga us-usarenda** - The passage doesn't focus on being discreet *while* camping, but on *where* you camp to avoid unwanted attention.

"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nangaramid manen iti Casablanca iti maikadua a daras?","The correct answer is **D: Ti sultan ti Morocco**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Imbangon manen ti sultan ti Morocco ti siudad ket pinanagananna iti Daru I-Badya sa Casablanca ti impanagan dagiti negosiante nga Espaniol a nakipatakder kadagiti paglakuan ditoy."" This directly translates to ""The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru I-Badya, although the Spanish merchants who established trading posts here called it Casablanca."" 

Therefore, the sultan of Morocco is the one who rebuilt Casablanca the second time.



"
Siasino ti pimmanaw iti moderno a siudad ti Casablanca kalpasan ti natural a didigra?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti Portuguese**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dinadael daytoy dagiti Portuges ken impatakder manen ti sirok iti baro a nagan a Casa Branca, tapno laeng maibati daytoy kalpasan iti gingined idi 1755."" This directly translates to ""It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt on its ruins with a new name, Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti Romano:** The text mentions the Romans used it as a strategic port, but doesn't say they rebuilt it after a disaster.
*   **C: Dagiti Espaniol:** The Spanish traders established routes *in* Casablanca, but didn't rebuild it after a disaster.
*   **D: Dagiti Phoenician:** The Phoenicians initially used it as a port, long before the 1755 earthquake.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a nakaala ti pannakaibigbig ti Sintra manipud kadagiti ganggannaet?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti positibo a nakuna ni Lord Byron**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti Sintra a nagbalin a nalatak kadagiti ganggannaet kalpasan ti panangisurat ni Lord Byron iti makaay-ayo a pannakailadawan ti kinapintasna."" (Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron wrote a beautiful description of its beauty.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cado da Roca** - Cabo da Roca is a location the bus stops at, but it doesn't explain *why* Sintra became popular.
*   **B: Dagiti aparision ti Marian** - The passage mentions Fatima and the apparition of Mary, but this is a separate location *north* of Sintra and doesn't explain Sintra's initial fame.
*   **D: Ti romantiko a pakasaritaanna** - While Sintra *is* romantic, the passage specifically credits Lord Byron's writings for its popularity, not just its inherent romance.



"
Ania ti saan a nabigbig ti Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti baro a republika**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nupay kasta, awan ti nasion - uray pay ti Armenia - nga opisial a nagbigbig iti daytoy."" (""However, no nation - not even Armenia - officially recognized it."")  ""Daytoy"" refers to the new republic formed in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti rehion ti Nagorno-Karabakh** - The text doesn't say Armenia didn't acknowledge the *region* itself, but the republic formed within it.
*   **B: Ti gubat a maissupiat ti Azeris** - Armenia *supported* the fight against the Azeris, not failed to acknowledge it.
*   **C: Dagiti diplomatiko nga argumento ti Azerbaijan** - The text says diplomatic disputes *damage* the relationship, but doesn't imply Armenia didn't acknowledge them.



"
Ania ti agtul-tuloy a makaapektar kadagiti relasion ti Azerbaijan ken Armenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti diplomatiko nga argumento (Diplomatic disputes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti diplomatiko a pannakisupiat ti rehion ket agtultuloy a mangdadael ti relasion baet ti Armenia ken Azerbaijan"" (The diplomatic dispute over the region continues to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan). This directly links ongoing diplomatic conflicts to the strained relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Dagiti Armenian nga agnanaed iti Azerbaijan (Armenians residing in Azerbaijan):** While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is *a result* of the conflict, the passage doesn't say this *causes* the continued strain.
* **B: Ti gubat idi 1994 (The 1994 war):** The war *created* the problem, but the passage focuses on what *continues* to affect the relationship *now*. The war is in the past.
* **D: Rehion ti Nagorno-Karabakh (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** The region is the *source* of the conflict, but the *disputes* over it are what actively damage the relationship, as highlighted in the text.



"
"Bayat ti panag-taxi iti Charlotte, ania ti mabalin a makaiyawat ti kanayonan a masingir?","The correct answer is **B: Kaadda ti tallo a pasahero**.

Here's why:

The passage states that taxis in Charlotte charge extra for more than 2 passengers, making it potentially more expensive than needed. This directly relates to the cost increasing with the number of passengers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagnaed iti sabali a lugar** - The passage doesn't mention anything about where people are going when they take a taxi.
*   **C: Panagapan iti Uptown** - Uptown Charlotte is mentioned as family-friendly, but not in relation to taxi costs.
*   **D: Panagbalin a mannakigayyem iti pamilia** - This is a general statement about Charlotte's appeal but doesn't relate to taxi fares.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maikonsiderar a saan a bentahe ti panagnaed iti Charlotte kadua dagiti ubbing?","The correct answer is **B: Panag-taxi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while families in Charlotte *can* use taxis, it can be **more expensive than necessary** because of the charge for each additional passenger. This implies it's a potential drawback or inconvenience when traveling with children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti presio ti pabalay (Housing prices)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about housing prices being a disadvantage.
*   **C: Dagiti residente manipud kadagiti sabali a lugar (Residents from other places)** - The passage states people *move* to Charlotte specifically *because* of its family-friendliness, so this isn't a negative.
*   **D: Panagpadas nga ipapas ti siudad (City's rapid growth)** - The passage mentions growth in family options over the last 20 years, which is generally positive.



"
"Sakbay a simmangpet dagiti Espaniol, siasino ti akin-kontrol iti amianan a paset ti Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti Inca**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sakbay a simmangpet dagiti Español idi maika-16 a siglo, ti makin-amianan a Chile ket naparmek ti linteg nga Inca..."" (Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti Mapuche:** The passage states the Mapuche lived in the *central and southern* parts of Chile, not the north.
*   **B: Dagiti Amerikano:** This is too broad. While the Inca and Mapuche are American indigenous peoples, the question asks specifically who controlled the northern region.
*   **C: Dagiti Araucanian:** Araucanian is another name for Mapuche, so this also refers to the central and southern regions.

Kasano a madanon dagiti tattao dagiti adayo a bario iti rehion ti Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Babaen ti lugan wenno tren**.

The passage states: ""Dagiti dalan, tren ken bangka ti mangikonektar kadagiti barbario..."" which translates to ""Roads, trains and boats connect the villages...""  Therefore, people reach the remote villages using roads (lugan) or trains.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Bangka (boats) are mentioned, but not as the *only* way.
* **C:** Bangka (boats) are mentioned, but the passage highlights roads and trains as connecting the villages.
* **D:** Eroplano (airplanes) are not mentioned in the text.



"
Ania ti kayat a saoen ti Italiano a termino a ‘Cinque Terre’?,"The correct answer is **A: Lima a bario**.

The text states: ""Cinque Terre, kayatna a sawen Lima a Daga..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands/Villages...""  ""Bario"" is the Filipino word for village or neighborhood, and in this context, accurately reflects the meaning of ""Terre"" in ""Cinque Terre"".

"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti bota ti maibagay para ti mabalin a nagalis a kondision iti panawen ti niebe?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti botas nga addaan ti naakikid a heel (Boots with a narrow heel)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Dagiti takong ket masapul nga ababa ken nalawa."" (Heels must be short and wide.) This directly contradicts options C (high heels).
* **The passage emphasizes traction:** It stresses the importance of a sole pattern depth of at least 5mm and a material that remains flexible in cold temperatures.  While ""studded soles"" (option B) would *also* be good, the passage doesn't specifically mention studs. A wide, low heel contributes to better stability and traction on slippery surfaces, which is what the passage focuses on.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage clearly states the pattern should be *at least* 5mm deep, not less.



"
Ania kadagitoy ti saan a makatulong iti traction kadagiti nagyelo a dalan bayat kadagiti kondision iti panawen ti niebe?,"The correct answer is **D: Danum**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *salt, gravel, or sand (calcium chloride)* are spread on roads and sidewalks to *improve* traction. It doesn't mention water helping with traction, and in fact, water can *freeze* and make surfaces *more* slippery.

Therefore, water is the only option that doesn't contribute to better traction on icy roads during snowy conditions."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nakanatad a nagpadaan ti Hawaii ken ti Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Agpada ti time zone**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ti isu met laeng nga oras ti Hawaii..."" which translates to ""the same time zone as Hawaii...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agpadada nga addaan ti adu a dadakkel nga hotel:** The passage specifically says Cook Islands *doesn't* have large hotels, unlike Hawaii.
* **B: Agpadada nga awan ti estadoda:** The passage mentions Cook Islands has free association with New Zealand, but doesn't state Hawaii lacks a statehood.
* **D: Agpadada nga awan ti aniaman a siudad:** The passage says Cook Islands has no *city* (siudad) but doesn't say Hawaii has no cities.

The passage states: ""Ti Cook Islands ket awan ti siudadna ngem addaan iti 15 a nadumaduma nga isla. Dagiti kangrunaan ket Rarotonga ken Aitutaki."" This directly contradicts the statement that Rarotonga and Aitutaki are cities. They are *islands*, not cities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Basbassit daytoy ngem Hawaii:** The passage says, ""Uray no basbassit..."" (Even though small...) indicating it's smaller than Hawaii.
*   **B: Maysa dayta nga arkipelago:** The passage states, ""Maysa nga arkipelago nga addaan iti 15 nga isla..."" (An archipelago with 15 islands...)
*   **D: Ti isla a nasion nga isu met laeng ti orasna iti Hawaii:** The passage states, ""ti isu met laeng nga oras ti Hawaii..."" (the same time zone as Hawaii...) and identifies it as an island nation.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad nga istasion ti ranger ti mangidiaya ti dua a tipo ti pagpilian iti pagturugan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Sirena**.

The text states: ""Ti Sirena laeng ti istasion ti tagabantay a mangitukon ti paggianan a dormitorio ken napudot a makan kanayonan ti panagkampo."" This means Sirena is the *only* ranger station that offers both dormitory lodging *and* hot meals alongside camping. The other stations (La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos) only offer camping without meal services.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ka a makareserba ti pammalubos iti pagparadaan no kayatmo a mangusar ti kuarta imbes a kredito?","The correct answer is **B: Ti Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabalin a makaala kadagiti permiso a direkta manipud iti Ranger Station iti Puerto Jimenez, ngem saanda nga agawat iti credit card.""  This directly says you can get permits *using cash* (implying not credit) at the Ranger Station in Puerto Jimenez.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti Sirena:** Sirena requires a permit *and* someone to accompany you, it doesn't specify a cash-only option.
*   **C: Ti CafeNet El Sol:** CafeNet El Sol charges a fee for *assistance* with reservations, not for the permit itself.
*   **D: Ti La Leona:** La Leona only offers camping without services, not permit reservations.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti skiing ti maar-aramid iti narangkis a daga?","The correct answer is **C: Alpine nga istilo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ti naudi [alpine ski] ket maubra **iti narangkis a daga** ken kasapula ti natangtangken a ski ken bota.""  This directly links alpine skiing to being done on ungroomed (narangkis) terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski hiking** - While related to skiing in the backcountry, the text doesn't specify it's done *on* ungroomed terrain.
*   **B: Backcountry skiing** - This is a broader term, and the passage contrasts it with alpine skiing on ungroomed terrain.
*   **D: Backpacking babaen ti ski** - This is the general term for the activity, but not the specific type done on ungroomed terrain.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a makatulong kadagiti agis-iski iti aw-away a mangayat ti makadanon iti nangatngato a kapaspas?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti nasayaat a kondision**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iti nasayaat a kondision ad-adayo ti madanunmo ngem no magmagnaka - ngem manmano laeng a madanunmo iti kapaspas ti panag-iski nga awan ti nadagsen a bitbitem kadagiti naiplastar a pag-iskian."" 

This directly translates to: ""In good conditions you can go further than if you hike - but you can only go as fast as skiing without a lot of trouble on prepared ski slopes.""  Good conditions are what allow for faster travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Natangtangken a bota (Detachable boots):** The text contrasts ski touring with alpine skiing which *requires* detachable boots. It doesn't say this *helps* with speed, just that it's a differentiating factor.
*   **B: Dagiti nadagsen a backpack (Heavy backpacks):** The text implies that backpacking is *part* of this activity, but doesn’t suggest that heavy backpacks would *increase* speed.  In fact, they’d likely slow you down.
*   **D: Dagiti naiplastar a pag-iskian (Prepared ski slopes):**  The text says ski touring is *different* from skiing on prepared slopes. It's the *lack* of prepared slopes that limits speed if conditions are bad.



"
Dagiti agbi-biahe a makapadpadas ti re-entry shock ket marigrigatan a mangaramid ti?,"The correct answer is **D: Panangibagay manen iti kulturada iti pagtaenganda**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""No agsubli iti balay malpas a nagtalinaed idiay sabali a nasion, naalam dagiti baro a kultura ken naibbatam dagiti nakasanayam a naggapu iti kultura iti balay a naggapuam."" This means returning travelers *change* and have difficulty readjusting to their original culture. This readjustment difficulty *is* re-entry shock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pannakibagay iti kultura ti baro a lugar** - This is the opposite of re-entry shock.  The passage discusses the *initial* adjustment to a new culture, not the difficulty of returning home.
* **B: Panagbalin a naanus ken mannakaawat** - While the passage mentions this is necessary for travelers *in* a foreign country, it doesn't say it's what they struggle with upon return.
* **C: Pangbiahe iti abroad** - The passage is about what happens *after* traveling abroad, not the act of traveling itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti re-entry shock ket naisingsingayan a narigat para ti ania a tipo ti agbi-biahe?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti agbi-biahe a napartak a nakibagay bayat ti panagtaeng iti abroad.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dagiti biahero nga alisto makibagay iti baro a kultura ket no dadduma ket marigatan nga agsubli iti bukodna a kultura.""  This directly translates to ""Travelers who *easily adapt* to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to return to their own culture."" This describes the re-entry shock being particularly strong for those who deeply integrated into the host culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti agbi-biahe a nakapadas ti partikular a madi a culture shock** - The text discusses re-entry shock, not the initial culture shock experience.
* **C: Dagiti agbi-biahe nga adda pay laeng iti honeymoon phase** - The text states the honeymoon phase *ends* before re-entry shock sets in.
* **D: Dagiti agbi-biahe a saan unay a naanus** - The text implies the opposite – that those who are *aware* and *understanding* (anus) need to be flexible, suggesting those *not* aware might struggle more overall, but doesn't specifically link that to re-entry shock.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti rumbeng a liklikan dagiti tattao nga aramiden kadagiti moose?,"The correct answer is **D: Panagobserbar manipud ti adayo (Observing from a distance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Moose will defend themselves if they feel threatened. If people don't appear to be a threat, moose generally won't bother them.
* **Observing from a distance** directly addresses avoiding a perceived threat.  Keeping your distance is the safest way to ensure the moose doesn't feel it needs to defend itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di ikankano ti kaadda dagitoy (Don't exist)** - This is irrelevant. Moose exist and you might encounter them.
* **B: Panagasideg a naannad (Getting close intentionally)** - This is *exactly* what you should *not* do, as it could provoke a moose.
* **C: Panagkissay ti lebel ti mabalin a peggadda (Testing their aggression level)** -  This is extremely dangerous and irresponsible. You shouldn't intentionally try to provoke a wild animal.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a sasao maipapan kadagiti moose ti saan a pudno?","The correct answer is **A: Dagitoy ket natural nga agresibo nga animal**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Ti moose...ket saan met a talaga a naranggas, ngem depensaranda iti bagida no makasagrapda ti pakadangran."" (Moose...are not really aggressive, but they defend themselves if they feel threatened.)
* This directly contradicts option A, which states they are *naturally* aggressive. The passage emphasizes they are defensive, not proactively aggressive.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the passage:

* **B: No maminsan ket saan a makita kas mabalin a peggad:**  The passage says ""No saan a makita dagiti tattao a mabalin a napeggad dagiti moose, amangan no asitganda unay dagitoy ket agpeggadda."" (If people aren't seen as a threat to moose, they might get too close and be attacked.)
* **C: Mabalin a ma-trigger dagiti tattao iti aglawlaw:** This is implied by the same sentence as B - getting too close can *trigger* an attack.
* **D: Idepensada ti bagbagida no kasapulan:**  The passage explicitly states ""depensaranda iti bagida no makasagrapda ti pakadangran."" (they defend themselves if they feel threatened.)



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan unay a delikado para ti agbi-biahe iti disierto?","The correct answer is **B: Ti panagkita ti mirage a mangiyaw-awat ti ilusion ti danum.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states mirages can be *deceptive* but doesn't say they are inherently dangerous.** They can lead to disappointment, but not directly to harm.
* **A: Kaawan ti napudot a bado iti nalammiis a rabii** - This is very dangerous, leading to hypothermia as the text explicitly states.
* **C: Panagsayang ti pigsa bayat ti panag-mirage** - This is dangerous, as chasing a mirage leads to wasted energy and lost fluids.
* **D: Panagsayang iti danum bayat ti panangsurot iti maysa a mirage** - This is extremely dangerous.  Wasting precious water in a desert is life-threatening.

Therefore, seeing a mirage, while potentially frustrating, is the *least* dangerous of the options presented.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga kas mabalin a peggad para kadagiti agbi-biahe iti disierto?,"The correct answer is **D: Sunburn**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **Mirage:** They can trick travelers into thinking there's water.
    * **Hypothermia:** It can occur at night in the cold desert.
    * **Dehydration (implied by ""natedda a danom""):** Losing fluids is a danger.

* **The passage *does not* mention sunburn.** While sunburn is a very real risk in the desert, it wasn't included in the information provided.

Therefore, **sunburn** is the only option that isn't a potential danger discussed in the text.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a populasion ti grupo ti talaga a naapektaran kalpasan ti panagsangpet dagiti abenturero?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti Taínos**.

The text explicitly states: ""permanenteng naipabassit dagiti manangraut nga Español ti populasion idiay Tainos"" (the Spanish conquistadors permanently diminished the Taino population) and provides a number – 100,000 Taino were killed between 1492 and 1498.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti Haitian** – The text mentions Haiti as sharing the island, but doesn't say their population was affected *by the arrival of the explorers* (it focuses on the impact on the Tainos).
*   **B: Dagiti Caribes** – The text states the Caribs arrived much earlier (10,000 BCE) and doesn't mention a population decrease due to the Spanish.
*   **D: Dagiti Espaniol** – The Spanish were the *cause* of the population decrease, not the affected group.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a legguahe ti sasaoen dagiti Caribes?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dagiti Caribes ti tattao nga agsasao ti Arawakan simmangpet idi agarup 10,000 BCE."" (The Caribs, people who spoke Arawakan, arrived around 10,000 BCE.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haitian:** Haitian is the language spoken in Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, but the passage states the *Caribs* spoke a different language.
*   **B: Espaniol:** Spanish became prominent *after* the arrival of the Spanish explorers, not before.
*   **C: Ingles:** English is not mentioned in the passage as a language of the original inhabitants.



"
Siasino ti nagpabalin a nalatak iti skiing kas maysa nga aktibidad a mangliwliwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti ski bum**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti panag-ski ti kangrunaan nga aktibidad a panagbiahe nga adu dagiti mangayat, a gagangay a maawagan kas “ski bums,” ti mangplanplano kadagiti sibubukel a bakasion nga ag-ski iti maysa a lugar."" This directly links ""ski bums"" to making skiing a popular recreational activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti Norwegian:** While the passage mentions Norwegians *founded* the first ski club, it doesn't say they popularized the activity itself.
* **C: Dagiti agtataeng iti kueba:** The passage mentions cave paintings of skiers from 5000 BC, showing the *earliest evidence* of skiing, not who made it popular.
* **D: Dagiti Australian:** Australians were mentioned as the location where the first ski club was founded, but not as those who popularized the activity.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a panawen a damo a nabigbig ti skiing kas maysa nga isport?","The correct answer is **D: Ti maika-17 a siglo**.

The passage states: ""Idi maika-17 a siglo ti panagpasalog a panag-iski a kas isport...""  This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti maika-18 a siglo** - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **B: 5000 BC** - This is when *images* of skiing were found, not when it became a sport.
*   **C: 1861** - This is when the first ski club was founded, not when skiing became a sport.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kadawyan a mainaig iti kadakkelan nga isla ti tan-aw ti daya a paset ti Africa?,"The correct answer is **C: Naatap nga animal**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ti Madagascar pay laeng ti kadakkelan, ken maysa a kontinente iti bukbukodna no maipanggep iti biag nga atap."" (Madagascar is the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Impluwensia ati Europe:** While European influence is mentioned, it's not specifically tied to the *largest* island.
*   **B: Islamiko a relihion:** Islam is mentioned as spreading through some of the islands, but not specifically as a defining characteristic of Madagascar.
*   **D: Dagiti nangina a resort:** The passage mentions nice beaches, but that's a characteristic of *most* of the islands, not just the largest.



"
Ania ti saan a langa dagiti babassit nga isla iti East Africa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ti reputasion para kadagiti naatap nga animal**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Kaadduan kadagiti babassit a isla ket dagiti nasion nga agwaywayas, wenno nainaig iti Pransia, ken nalatak para kadagiti nangingina a pagayuyangan nga aplaya."" This covers options A and B (connection to France and many luxury resorts).
*   **The passage also states:** ""Ti Madagascar pay laeng ti kadakkelan, ken maysa a kontinente iti bukbukodna no maipanggep iti biag nga atap."" This implies Madagascar is known for its unique wildlife, but the passage *doesn't* say the smaller islands share this reputation.
*   **The passage doesn’t mention** the islands being particularly known for unique animal life beyond Madagascar. While they have ecosystems, the text doesn't highlight this.
*   **Option D** is incorrect, as the passage says many are independent nations or associated with France, meaning they *are* connected to other nations.

Therefore, the feature not generally associated with the smaller East African islands, according to the text, is a reputation for unique animal life."
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a maiselebrar ti Easter iti sumagmamano a naisingingayan a tradisional a simbaan?","The correct answer is **B: Panag-host ti vigil iti Sabado ti rabii**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ad-adu pay a tradisional a simbaan ti mangiyusuat ti Panagkararag ti Semana iti rabii ti Sabado kabayatan ti Semana santa..."" which translates to ""More traditional churches will hold the Easter Vigil on the night of Saturday during Holy Week...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagangay ti ritual ti fertilidad (Conducting a fertility ritual):** While the passage mentions pre-Christian roots possibly involving spring and the sun, it doesn't state these rituals are *currently* practiced as part of Easter celebrations.
*   **C: Kaaddaan ti spring party para ti kagimongan (Having a spring party for the community):** The passage focuses on religious observance, not a general community party.
*   **D: Panagbuya ti panagungar ti init (Celebrating the rising of the sun):** The passage mentions the sun as a potential pre-Christian symbolic connection, but the main current practice described is the vigil.



"
"Tapno maliklikan dagiti paritkular a kasapulan no sumsumrek iti Ecuador, ti maysa nga umili Cuba ket masapul nga addaan umuna ti ania?","The correct answer is **B: Ti napagbalin a legal a surat ti imbitasion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sapulen ti Ecuador dagiti umili ti Cuba ti surat nga imbitasion sakbay a sumrekda iti Ecuador..."" (Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to have a letter of invitation before entering Ecuador...). It further specifies that this letter needs to be legalized by the Ecuadorian Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti passport a mabalin agingga ti 6 a bulan a labes dagiti petsa ti panagbiahe** - While true (the passage mentions passport validity), it's not the *first* thing needed to avoid requirements. The invitation letter is mentioned first as a prerequisite.
* **C: Ti tiket a mapan ken agpasubli tapno mapaneknekan ti kaatiddog ti panagtalinaed** -  This is *required*, but not the key to avoiding specific requirements in the first place.
* **D: Ti green a kard iti US** - This only applies to Cuban citizens *with* a US green card; they have a different process (visiting the Ecuadorian consulate). It doesn't apply to all Cuban citizens.



"
Ania ti saan a nakaidisenioan dagiti kasapulan ti panagbiahe iti Ecuador?,"The correct answer is **A: Panagtalinaed iti kababaan a bilang dagiti agbi-biahe** (Staying the least number of travelers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the requirements are made ""to provide an organized flow of entry between the two countries.""** This points to managing *how* people enter, not necessarily limiting *how many* enter.
* **B: Panangmentenar ti naurnos nga ayus ti migrasion** (Maintaining an orderly migration system) - This is directly stated in the text (""mangited ti na-organisa nga urnos ti panagakar"").
* **C: Panangkumpirma ti kaatiddog ti panagtalinaed ti agbi-biahe** (Confirming the length of stay of travelers) - The passage mentions needing a round-trip ticket to ""verify the duration of your stay.""
* **D: Panagsigurado kadagiti kinabalin dagiti passport** (Ensuring the validity of passports) - The passage specifically states the passport must have at least 6 months validity.

The requirements focus on *how* Cubans enter Ecuador (with a letter, legalized by the Foreign Minister, etc.), not on limiting the *number* of Cuban travelers.



"
Ania ti sumaganad ti nangin-ngina iti sabali a pagilian ngem iti pagtataengan?,"The correct answer is **B: Dagiti nangina a frame**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dagiti agpayso nga imported ket mabalin a nanginngina ngem iti adda diay balay."" This directly translates to ""some imported ones may be more expensive than those at home."" The question asks what is more expensive in another country than at home, and the passage specifically identifies the frames as being potentially more expensive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti eksamen ti mata (Eye exams)** - The passage suggests eye exams *might* be cheaper abroad, not more expensive.
*   **C: Seguro ti panagkita (Vision insurance)** - The passage doesn’t discuss the price of vision insurance in other countries.
*   **D: Dagiti saan a branded a frame (Non-branded frames)** - While the passage mentions potential fakes, it doesn't state that non-branded frames are specifically more expensive abroad. The issue is whether *any* frames are more expensive when imported.



"
Ania ti mabalin a peggad kadagiti panaggatang ti nangina a frame iti sabali a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **C: Mabalin a peke dagitoy** (They might be fake).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""mabalin a dagiti dadduma ket peke"" (some of them might be fake) when discussing the risks of buying frames from other countries.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ti kanayonan nga eksamen ti mata ket mabalin a maikasapulan** (A thorough eye exam may be necessary) - While the passage *recommends* an exam, it doesn't say it's a guaranteed problem with buying frames abroad.
* **B: Ti reseta ket mabalin a saanen a mabalin para kadagiti partikular a frame** (The prescription may not be valid for certain frames) -  The passage says you can show the prescription anywhere, implying it *is* generally valid.
* **D: Mabalin a saan a saklawen ti seguro ti gastos** (Insurance might not cover the cost) - The passage mentions insurance coverage for exams *locally*, but doesn't directly state if it won't cover frames purchased elsewhere.

"Maipapan ti panagusar ti currency iti Falkland, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Malaksit ti pound ti Falkland, ti pound ti Britanio ket kadawyan a maakseptar a currency.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""British pounds can be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley..."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says US dollars are *often* accepted, not just credit cards and British pounds.
* **B:** While the passage mentions Stanley, it doesn’t say US dollars are *only* accepted there. They are accepted throughout the islands.
* **C:** The passage explicitly states it's ""virtually impossible"" to exchange currency *on* the Falklands, so you must exchange *before* you go.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, no agbi-biahe iti Falklands manipud ti Estados Unidos, sadinno a mabalin a mausar ti sabali pay a pamay-an ti panagbayad malaksid ti credit cards ti talaga a makatulong?","The correct answer is **A: Iti paggatangan ti FIC West**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that you can exchange money at a bank on the islands *through* FIC West. It also states that US dollars are ""often accepted"" but you should check *first* what payment methods are accepted. This implies FIC West is a primary place to handle currency exchange and potentially use USD.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kabayatan ti amin nga isla:** While British pounds are accepted everywhere, the passage focuses on where to *exchange* currency, and specifically mentions FIC West.
*   **C: Kadagiti adayo nga isla:** The passage explicitly states credit cards from *foreign* islands are unlikely to be accepted.
*   **D: Kabayatan iti Stanley:** While Stanley has the banks for exchange, the passage points specifically to FIC West as the intermediary.



"
Ania a pasamak ti saan a nainaig kadagiti selebrasion dagiti fiesta ti templo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti pannakaiyanak ti elepante (The birth of an elephant)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals are usually celebrated as part of:

*   The temple's anniversary
*   The birthday of a god
*   Important events related to the temple

The birth of an elephant is not mentioned as a reason for temple festivals in the passage. It's part of the *spectacle* of the festivals (decorated elephants in parades), but not a reason *for* the celebration itself.



"
Sadinno a lugar a makita dagiti naarkosan nga elepante?,"The correct answer is **C: Kadagiti parada dagiti piesta ti templo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...adda ti regular a parada dagiti naarkosan nga elepante..."" (there is a regular parade of decorated elephants...) as part of the temple festivals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sadinno man mangrugi iti agtapos ti Nobiembre agingga iti katengngaan ti Mayo** - This is the *time* when the festivals (and therefore the elephants) are seen, not *where* they are.
* **B: Kadagiti templo** - While the elephants are *associated* with temples, they are specifically seen during the parades.
* **D: Kadagiti dalan ti Kerala** - The passage doesn't mention elephants being seen in the streets of Kerala generally, only as part of the temple parades.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti posible unay a wagas tapno makatipid ti kuarta iti business wenno first class a pamasahe iti eroplano?","The correct answer is **D: Panagbirok ti diskuento** (Finding discounts).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""saan a nalaka ti bayad daytoy... uray agbirok kadagiti diskuento iti para negosio wenno primera-klase a tugtugaw kadagiti direkta a panagtayab."" This means looking for discounts is a potential, although difficult, way to save money on business or first class tickets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pabayadan daytoy iti kompaniam** (Have the company pay for it) - The passage mentions this as a possibility (""bay-am a ti kompaniam ti mangaramid para kenka"") but doesn't frame it as a way *you* can actively save money, it's relying on someone else to pay.
*   **B: Panag-book ti first class imbes a business** (Book first class instead of business) - The passage states first class is *more* expensive than business class, so this would not save money.
*   **C: Panag-book ti saan a tarus a first class a flight** (Book a non-direct first class flight) - The passage doesn't discuss non-direct flights as a cost-saving measure.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti sayang laeng iti oras a biruken no ag-book kadagiti partikular a klase ti pamasahe?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti diskuento**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""saan a nalaka ti bayad daytoy: no kuentaem, baka mamimpat iti presio ti gagangay nga economy class ti pletem para iti business class, ken mamin-onse met para iti first class! Iti kaaduanna, awan mamaayna nga uray agbirok kadagiti diskuento iti para negosio wenno primera-klase a tugtugaw kadagiti direkta a panagtayab..."" 

This directly translates to: ""it's not easy to justify the cost: when you calculate, the price of a regular economy class ticket might be multiplied for a business class, and even more for first class! In most cases, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights...""

Therefore, the passage suggests that searching for discounts on business or first class is a waste of time.



"
Ania ti saan a kasapulan a mainayon bayat ti pannakaiyasping ti dagup a quote ti pamasahe paapan ti Africa iti round-the-world a pamasahe?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasto para ti African a visa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Madim a liplipatan a mangnayon ti ekstra a gastos para iti mainayon a visa, buis tapno makapanaw, transportasion, ken dadduma pay para iti amin a lugar nga adda iti ruar ti Africa.""  When comparing a trip *through* Africa on a round-the-world ticket, you *don't* need to factor in the cost of visas for countries *outside* of Africa that might be part of the overall round-the-world itinerary (options A and D).  You also don't need to factor in exit taxes from Africa itself (option B) because the passage implies these are *already* included in the flight costs being compared.

However, you *do* need to consider the cost of any visas specifically required to *enter* African countries as part of that African leg of the journey.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti irugrugi nga idiaya dagiti supermarket iti ad-adu a pagpilian?","The correct answer is **A: Nakasaganan a makan (Processed food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti supermarket ket agbalbalin nga umadu ti agduduma a seksion iti **naisaganan a makan**."" (Supermarkets are becoming more numerous in sections of **processed food**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti mircowave oven (Microwave ovens)** - While the passage mentions some supermarkets *offer* microwaves, it doesn't say this is what they are *increasing* in selection of.
* **C: Dagiti on-site a restauran (On-site restaurants)** - The passage discusses on-site restaurants in relation to places *without* many supermarkets, not within supermarkets themselves.
* **D: Nalalaka a presio (Easy pricing)** - The passage mentions ""informal pressure"" on pricing, but doesn't state supermarkets are increasing their selection based on this.



"
Ania nga amenity ti ipaay ti sumagmamano a supermarket a mabalin a kayat ti kostumer a gumat-gatang ti nakasaganan a makan?,"The correct answer is **D: Maysa a microwave oven**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Dagiti supermarket ket agbalbalin nga umadu ti agduduma a seksion iti naisaganan a makan. Adda pay ti mangted ti microwave oven wenno sabali pay a wagas a pagpapudot ti makan.""  This directly answers the question about amenities offered for those buying pre-made food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti panganan iti site (On-site dining):** While some supermarkets *might* have dining areas, the passage doesn't focus on this as an amenity for pre-made food.
* **B: Basbassit a pagpilian (Limited selection):** The passage implies supermarkets are *increasing* selection, not limiting it.
* **C: Naata a makan (Fresh food):** While freshness is important, the passage doesn't mention it as a specific amenity offered.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maawatan dagiti agsasao ti French a Belgian ken Swiss?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti pagalagadan a sistema ti numero a Pranses**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ngem, amin a Belgian ken Swiss nga agsasao ti Pranses ket naadalda ti pagalagadan a Pranses idiay eskuelaan, isu a mabalinda a matarusan uray pay no usarem ti pagalagadan a sistema ti numero a Pranses."" (But all Belgian and Swiss French speakers were taught standard French in school, so they can understand even if the standard French number system is used.)

This explicitly says they *can* understand the standard French number system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti naisingsingayan a sao iti French:** The passage mentions slight differences in vocabulary.
* **C: Dagiti partikular a panangbalikas kadagiti sao iti French:**  The passage explicitly states pronunciation differs slightly.
* **D: Kaaduan a pagsasao a French idiay France:**  The passage states that while there are differences, they can still understand each other.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga agpada iti France kas iti Belgium wenno Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti panagebkas kadagiti amin a sarita**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ngem, amin a Belgian ken Swiss nga agsasao ti Pranses ket naadalda ti pagalagadan a Pranses idiay eskuelaan, isu a mabalinda a matarusan uray pay no usarem ti pagalagadan a sistema ti numero a Pranses."" (But all Belgian and Swiss French speakers are taught standard French in school, so they can understand even if they use the standard French numbering system). This means pronunciation, spelling, and standard French are taught the same.
* **The passage also states:** ""...ken ti panangbalikas iti dadduma a sao ket sabali bassit."" ( ...and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.) - this indicates *some* differences in pronunciation, but not *all* words.
* **The passage specifically mentions differences in:**
    * **The numbering system (B)**
    * **The pronunciation of some words (A)**
    * **Spelling of some words (D)**
* **The passage states that everyone learns standard French in school, meaning the common French taught in schools (C) is the same.**

Therefore, the statement that is *not* the same in France as in Belgium or Switzerland is the pronunciation of *all* words. Only *some* words are pronounced differently.



"
Iti ania a kasasaad a saan ka a maidiayaan ti bereavement a pamasahe?,"The correct answer is **A: No agbibiahe ka iti WestJet**.

Here's why:

The passage states the bereavement fares are offered by Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, *and* WestJet. However, it also states that to get these fares, you *must* book directly with the airline via phone.  The question asks about a situation where you *wouldn't* qualify. WestJet is specifically mentioned as offering the fare, so if you're flying with them, you *can* potentially get it.  The other options don't indicate a reason for disqualification – they either mention airlines that *do* offer the fare, or relate to booking methods that are the *requirement* for getting the fare.



"
Ania ti agpaypayso maipapan kadagiti bereavement a pamasahe?,"The correct answer is **D: Kasapulanda nga i-book a tarus iti airline babaen ti telepono.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""masapul nga agpareserbaka babaen ti telepono a direkta iti kompania ti eroplano"" (must be booked directly with the airline by phone) when referring to bereavement fares. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sakupenda ti gasto iti biahe ti pumpon** - While bereavement fares often *help* with the cost of travel for the funeral, the passage doesn't state they *cover* the entire cost.
*   **B: Kasapulanda nga i-book a tarus iti website ti airline** - This is the *opposite* of what the passage states.
*   **C: Sakupenda ti gasto ti nagannat a biahe** - The passage doesn't mention covering travel expenses for other mourners, only related to attending the funeral.



"
Kaano a nanamnam-ay ti panagusar ti standalone a GPS device ngem ti navigation app a GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: No mapan iti ruar ti sakup a lugar**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that GPS navigation apps on smartphones have limited or no functionality *when you are outside of data coverage*.  A standalone GPS device doesn't rely on data coverage, making it a better choice when you'll be in areas without a signal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No padpadasem ti agtipid iti kuarta:** The passage says apps *save* money compared to other GPS options, so this is the opposite of when you'd prefer a standalone device.
* **B: No sigurado ka nga addan ti koneksionmo iti data:** If you *have* data coverage, the app works fine - no need for a standalone device.
* **D: No saanmo a kayat a mangabang ti device:**  This is about wanting to avoid rental, not a reason to choose one device over another.



"
Ania ti saan a nasayaat a rason nga usaren ti navigation app a GPS kas maiyasping iti standalone a device?,"The correct answer is **A: Saanen a kasapulan nga agdanag maipapan ti koneksion iti data**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""No awan ti koneksion ti data dita teleponom, wenno awanka iti sakopna, ti performancena ket mabalin a limitado wenno saan a magun-odan."" This means a *disadvantage* of GPS apps is their reliance on data connection.  The question asks for a reason why it's *not* good to use the app.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagtipid ti kuarta:** The passage says apps *can* save money.
* **C: Panangliklik kadagiti panagabang:** The passage says apps can help avoid rental costs.
* **D: Saanen a kasapulan a gumatang kadagiti baro a mapa:** The passage says apps can save money compared to buying new maps.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasanom a masigurado a naipada ka ti maibagay a barko?","The correct answer is **C: Panag-book iti ahente a nalaing iti panagbiahe ti Galapagos** (Booking with an agent who is knowledgeable about Galapagos travel).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Siguraduem a ti ahente a nagpapareserbaam ket maysa nga espesialista iti Galapagos nga addaan umiso a pannakaammo iti adu a klase ti barbarko.**"" (Make sure the agent booking for you is a Galapagos specialist with extensive knowledge of the different types of boats.) This directly answers the question of how to ensure you're matched with a suitable boat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While traveling with a group of similar interests is good, the passage doesn't say this *guarantees* a suitable boat.
*   **B:** Booking during the low season helps with availability, but doesn't ensure the *right* boat for your interests.
*   **D:** Booking far in advance is recommended for availability, but again, doesn't guarantee the boat suits *your* needs.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nausar kas taktika tapno mapagtalinaed nga agsug-sugal dagiti bisita?","The correct answer is **A: Ti kaadi ti natural a silaw** (The presence of natural light).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **D: Kinaawan ti relo** (Lack of clocks) - ""Masansan nga awan iti tawa ken pag-orasanda...""
    * **C: Dagiti komplimentario a mainum** (Complimentary drinks) - ""Sumagmamano a lugar ket mangmangted ti libre nga arak.""
    * **B: Dagiti insentibo kas kadagiti libre a tiket iti konsierto** (Incentives like free concert tickets) - While not *specifically* concert tickets, the passage says casinos offer ""espesial a makan, mainom ken pagraragsakan"" (special food, drinks, and entertainment) - this covers incentives.

* **The passage does *not* mention anything about manipulating natural light.**  In fact, casinos are often designed *without* natural light to disorient players.

Therefore, the only option *not* used as a tactic to keep people gambling is the presence of natural light.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a liklikan ti nalaing a sugalero?","The correct answer is **A: Panaginum ti adu nga arak**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some places offer free alcohol and that ""all good gamblers know the importance of sobriety."" This directly implies that a good gambler needs to *avoid* drinking too much alcohol.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangawat kadagiti aniaman nga insentibo (Accepting any incentives):** The passage mentions free food, drinks, and entertainment are *offered to gamblers* to keep them playing, not that a good gambler should avoid them.
* **C: Panagkita kadagiti relo wenno orasan (Looking at watches or clocks):** The passage states gamblers often lose track of time, not that they should avoid looking at timepieces.
* **D: Panagdamag iti kaasitgan a pagruaran (Staying in the nearest casino):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about location of the casino.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a paset ti pagsasao ti ma-capitalize iti tengnga ti keddeng?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti noun**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amin a nombre, kadua dagita sao ni Sie para kenka, ket kanayon nga umuna ti dakkel a letra, uray no adda sadiay tengngana ti keddeng. Daytoy ket maysa a nangruna a wagas tapno mailasin ti baet ti mano a berbo ken **bambanag**.""

""Bambanag"" translates to ""noun"" in English. The text explicitly says capitalization is used to distinguish between verbs and nouns, *even in the middle of a word*.  This implies that nouns are always capitalized, even mid-word.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti aksion (Actions/Verbs):** The passage specifically mentions distinguishing *from* verbs, not capitalizing them.
*   **C: Dagiti adjective (Adjectives):** The passage doesn't mention capitalizing adjectives.
*   **D: Dagiti adverb (Adverbs):** The passage doesn't mention capitalizing adverbs.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a mangparigat iti kapitalisasion dagiti noun?","The correct answer is **C: Panagsurat**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ngem ti panagsurat adda met pagkakomplikadona gapu ta masapul a maammuam no ti verb wenno adjective ket mausar iti pormanana substantivized."" ( ""...but writing has its complexities because you need to know if a verb or adjective is used in its substantivized form."")

This directly points to the *act of writing* as the source of difficulty when deciding whether to capitalize nouns, especially when verbs or adjectives are being used *as* nouns.  The passage highlights the challenge in *writing* due to needing to identify when a word functions as a noun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagbasa (Reading):** The passage states reading is *easier* than writing in this regard.
* **B: Panagbigbig kadagiti aksion (Emphasizing actions):** While actions can *be* nouns, the passage doesn’t focus on emphasizing them, but rather on *identifying* nouns that were originally other parts of speech.
* **D: Panagbigbig kadagiti banbanag (Emphasizing things):** Similar to B, the passage isn't about emphasizing things, but identifying what *is* a thing (a noun) in a sentence.



"
"Kadagiti rural a paset ti Malaysia, ania a gesture ti kayatna a saoen ket “umay ka ditoy”?","The correct answer is **A: Panagkillu ti tammudo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngem idiay Malaysia, kadagiti Malay iti sulsulimek, kayatna sawen ket “umay ka,” kasla ti tammudo a kulpiem..."" This translates to ""But in Malaysia, among the Malays in the countryside, it means 'come here,' like a beckoning with the fingers, a gesture used internally by countries, and only used as such.""

Therefore, the gesture meaning ""come here"" in rural Malaysia is mimicking beckoning fingers, or ""panagkillu ti tammudo"".



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a gesture ti mabalin a kayatna a saoen ket “agsubli ka”?","The correct answer is **A: Panagpayapay ti ima nakasango ti dakulap** (Waving your hand with the palm facing outwards).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Kasta met, maysa a biahero a Briton iti Espania ket mabalin nga agkamali a ti panagkaway nga agpakada pakairamanan ti dakulap a sumango iti agpakpakada (saan nga iti tao a pagpakpakadaan) ket mangibaga nga agsublika."" This directly translates to: ""Also, a British traveler in Spain might mistakenly think that waving with the palm facing outwards (not at a person) means 'come back.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Panagkillu ti maysa a tammudo** (Killing a cat) - This is mentioned as a meaning in Malaysia, but not related to the ""agsubli ka"" gesture.
*   **C: Panagpayapay ti ima a nakalikod ti dakulap** (Waving your hand with the palm facing inwards) - The passage specifically says the *outward* wave is misinterpreted.
*   **D: Panagtung-ed ti ulo** (Nodding the head) - This gesture isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti gapu dagiti yuyeng?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti rangtay a niebe** (Snow bridges).

The passage explicitly states: ""Paggapuan daytoy iti birri, **yuyeng**, a mabalin mailemmeng dagiti rangtay a niebe."" (This is caused by crevices, **gaps**, which can be hidden by snow bridges.)

Therefore, the passage directly identifies snow bridges as the cause of the gaps.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti maidulin ti rangtay ti niebe?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti bettak**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yuyeng, a mabalin mailemmeng dagiti **rangtay ti niebe**."" (ice, which can bury the **snow bridges**). This directly links ""yuyeng"" (ice) to ""rangtay ti niebe"" (snow bridges) as something that can cover them. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti kueba a yelo (Ice caves):** The passage says ice caves *might* collapse, but doesn't say they are covered by snow bridges.
* **C: Dagiti diding (Walls):**  The passage states walls *might* collapse, but doesn’t link them to snow bridges.
* **D: Dagiti dadakkel a bloke (Large blocks):**  Large blocks *fall* from the ice, they don't form or cover snow bridges.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, dagiti agbi-biahe ket masapul a mangaramid kadagiti kanayonan a panagannad sakbay ti panagbisita ti ania a lugar?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti lugar iti lawlaw ti Goma**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...masapul nga ammuen nga umuna ti situasion ti agdama a panaglalaban iti probinsia ti Amianan a Kivu sakbay ti aniaman a panagpasiar iti ruar ti Goma."" This means travelers need to check the security situation *before* visiting areas *outside* of Goma.  This implies caution is needed for locations in the surrounding area (the ""lawlaw"" or outskirts) of Goma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti bulkan ti Nyiragongo:** While visiting Nyiragongo requires travel, the text doesn't specifically say to check security *before* planning that trip, just before leaving Goma.
*   **C: Ti sentro ti ili:** The text mentions the center of the city was damaged by lava, but doesn't suggest a specific security check is needed there.
*   **D: Rwanda:**  The passage mentions Goma's proximity to Rwanda, but doesn't imply any security precautions needed *before* traveling to Rwanda.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nasayaat a singasing para ti turista iti Goma?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti motorcycle a taxi ket mayat a wagas tapno makita ti lawlaw.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mabalinka aglugan iti boda-boda (taxi a motor) tapno aglikaw iti Goma."" This means boda-bodas are for *getting around* Goma, not for sightseeing (""makita ti lawlaw"" - to see the sights).  It doesn't suggest they are a good way to see the city's attractions.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Dagiti laban iti North Kivu ket makaliwliwa** - The text explicitly says to be aware of the current conflict situation in North Kivu before traveling outside of Goma.  This implies the conflict *is* a concern.
* **B: Mayat a lugar daytoy para ti nalaka a Mountain Gorilla Tracking** - The text states Goma is a starting point for Mountain Gorilla tracking.
* **D: Ti base ti bulkan a Nyiragongo ket adda iti siudad** - The text states Goma is the starting point for hiking to Nyiragongo volcano, implying its base is nearby and accessible from the city.



"
Kaano nga agbalin a sidadaan ti backcountry a pammalubos para ti rugi nga aldaw ti Agosto?,"The correct answer is **B: Maika-1 ti Abril** (January 1st).

Here's why:

The text states backcountry permits become available *four months before* the start of the month you want to hike.  August is four months after April. Therefore, permits for August become available on April 1st.

Let's break it down:

* **May:** Permits available January 1st
* **June:** Permits available February 1st
* **July:** Permits available March 1st
* **August:** Permits available April 1st



"
Ania a polisiya ti adda tapno masalakniban ti canyon?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti limitado a bilang dagiti pammalubos**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Limitado dagiti permiso tapno maprotektaran ti ginget..."" (Permits are limited to protect the environment). This is the core policy in place to safeguard the canyon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti umuna a mapan, umuna a maserbian a sistema ti pammalubos** (First-come, first-served system of permits) - While walk-in permits *are* first-come, first-served, it's not the overarching policy. The primary reason for the system is limitation.
* **B: Dagiti pammalubos ket sidadaan laeng iti maika-1 ti Enero** (Permits are only available on January 1st) - The passage states permits for May become available on January 1st, but doesn't say that's the *only* time permits are issued.
* **C: Dagiti pammalubos ket magun-od laeng babaen kadagiti walk-in a kiddaw** (Permits are only obtained through walk-in requests) - The passage says there are a *few* walk-in permits, but doesn't indicate that’s the only way to get one. Reservations are also possible.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan unay a kadawyan a mabirukan iti tipo dagiti hotel a nailadawan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti nabiit pay a naurnos a kuarto nga addaan kadagiti moderno a panagpabaro** (Newly renovated rooms with modern upgrades).

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes these hotels as having ""kadaanan a fitting, iti kurang a baro a pasilidad, ken naisabsabali a naimnasna kinadaan"" (old fittings, less new facilities, and somewhat faded grandeur). This directly contradicts the idea of *newly renovated* rooms with *modern upgrades*.

Let's look at why the other options are likely to be found:

*   **A: Maysa a cocktail bar** - Hotels catering to the wealthy in that era would likely have a bar for socializing.
*   **B: Maysa nga onsite gourmet a restoran** - High-end hotels would absolutely offer fine dining.
*   **C: Dagiti kadua a bisita a popular wenno mabigbig** - The passage states they hosted ""bumisita nga ulo iti estado ken dadduma pay a dignitario"" (visiting heads of state and dignitaries), meaning famous or important guests.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naipresentar iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a maidiaya ti saan unay nga umuna a kitaen ti maysa a bisita ti hotel?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti nalaka a rate iti kuarto (Affordable room rates)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states these hotels catered to the *wealthy*. They were known for luxurious experiences like fine dining and nightlife. Affordable rates would be *contrary* to the description of the hotels and their clientele.

Let's look at why the other options are likely to be found:

*   **A: Dagiti antique a muebles iti tagikua (Antique furniture in the lobby):** The passage mentions ""kadaanan a fitting"" (old fittings) and ""naimnasna kinadaan"" (nostalgic charm), which strongly suggests antique furnishings.
*   **B: Maysa a panganan nga addaan ti popular a tagaluto (A restaurant with a popular chef):** The hotels were known for ""naiimas a makan"" (fine dining), so a good restaurant is probable.
*   **C: Maysa a sala a mangidiaya ti kada rabii a mangliwliwa (A hall that offers nightly entertainment):** The passage mentions ""biag iti rabii"" (nightlife), implying entertainment.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a liklikan dagiti agbi-biahe a bumis-bisita iti Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: Panangtukoy ti native ti Greenland kas maysa nga “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: *""Nupay ti sao nga “Eskimo” ket maakseptar latta idiay Estados Unidos, maibilang daytoy kas makaipababa kadagiti adu nga Antarktiko a tattao a saan a taga-U.S., kangrunaan ti Canada.""* This means visitors should avoid using the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to the people of Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text states that crime is not a problem in Greenland (""Ti krimen, ken kinadakes a panunot para kadagiti tagaruar ti pagilian, ket saanmo makita idiay Greenland."").
* **B:** The text mentions needing appropriate clothing for *cold* weather, not that it's generally hot.
* **C:** The text states Greenland has good internet access (""93% ti populasionna ti addaan access iti internet."").



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kangrunaan nga agbalin a problema para kadagiti saan a nakasagana nga agbi-biahe a bumis-bisita ti Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Panawen** (Weather/Season).

Here's why:

The text specifically states:

*   ""Mabalin a ti laeng nalamiis a panawen ti pudpudno a peggad a sanguen ti saan a nakasagana."" (The only real problem for unprepared travelers is the cold season.)
*   ""No agpasiarka idiay Greenland kadagiti panawen a kalamiisna (no ad-adayo ti papanam nga agpaamianan, lumamlamiis met), kasapulan ti panangitugot iti bado a para lam-ek."" (When traveling in warmer seasons, warm clothing is still needed.)
*   ""Dagiti nakabaybayag nga aldaw ti pinagbabara ket mabalin a mangited dagiti problema ti panagala ti umdas a turog ken mairaman a saksakiten."" (Long daylight hours can cause sleep problems and illness.)
*   ""No madama ti kalgaw, siputanyo met dagiti lamok a Nordic."" (In the summer, you will encounter Nordic mosquitoes.)

While Nordic mosquitoes *are* mentioned, they are described as an annoyance (""makasinga dagitoy"") rather than a major problem.  Krimen is explicitly stated as *not* being a problem, and the text doesn't suggest issues with the local people. Therefore, the **season/weather** is the primary concern for unprepared travelers.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti maus-usar itan kas sentral a plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Daytoy itan ti sentro a plaza..."" (This is now a central plaza...) referring to Jardín de la Unión. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti Alley of the Kiss (Ti Callejon del Beso)** - The text describes it as a place with a love story, not a central plaza.
* **C: Ti Templo de San Diego** - The text says it's the *only remaining structure* of a 17th-century convent, not a plaza.
* **D: Ti Callejon del Beso** - Same as B, it's a specific location with a story, not the central plaza itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a mabirukan iti Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Maysa a daan a kamarin ti kumbento**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Nabangon daytoy a lugar a kas atrium para iti maika-17 siglo a kombento, a ti Templo de Sandiego ti kakaisuna a nabatbati a patakder."" (This place was built as an atrium for a 17th-century convent, with the Temple of San Diego being the only remaining structure.) This means the *atrium* exists where the convent once was, but the *rooms of the convent* themselves are not mentioned as being present or found there now.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Ti akintengnga a gazebo nga addaan kadagiti konsierto** - The text says ""masansan nga adda dagiti libre a konsiero iti akintengnga a gazebo.""
* **B: Ti pagtaengan ti agkakauna nga istoria ti ayat** - The text refers to ""Callejon del Beso (Dalan iti Bisong). Dua a balkonahe a napagsina iti 69 a sentimetro laeng ket pagtaengan ti agkakauna nga istoria ti ayat.""
* **C: Dagiti panganan a sango iti hardin** - The text says ""Adu dagti restaurant iti aglawlaw ti hardin.""



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti panaguli ti bantay iti aldaw ti maikonsiderar a saan a nakanatad?","The correct answer is **D: Ti panag-hike iti aldaw ket saan a maibagay nga aktibidad iti ruar para kadagiti pamilia nga addaan ti maladaga.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dagiti pamilia nga adda iti babassit nga ubbingna ket kasapulan ti ad-adu a panagsagana, ngem ti maysa aldaw a panagruar ket nalaklaka nga agbalin uray pay no adda ti tagibi ken uryet.""  This *contradicts* the statement that hiking is not suitable for families with young children. The passage says it *can* be done, with more planning.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Bassit laeng a panagsagana ti masapul para kadagiti panaguli iti aldaw kadagiti nalaka a pagnaan** - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **B: Agduduma dagiti kaadayo na, ngem naigandat met a masakup ti kalawa ti maysa nga aldaw** -  The passage mentions distances ranging from under a mile to what can be covered in a day.
* **C: Dagiti tattao a kalalaingan laeng ti lebel ti kinakaradkad a ket iti sapasap a maipapasda daytoy nga aktibidad** - The passage says ""sinnoman a nasalun-at a tao ket mabalin nga aglinglingay kadagitoy."" (anyone in good health can do it).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a mangikasapulan ti bassit laeng a panagsagana ti panaguli ti bantay iti aldaw?","The correct answer is **B: No inaigna ti nalaklaka a pagnaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Para iti panagkalay-at iti aldaw iti nalaka a dalan bassit lang a panagsagana ti masapul, ken sinnoman a nasalun-at a tao ket mabalin nga aglinglingay kadagitoy.""  This directly translates to ""For a day hike on an easy trail, little preparation is needed, and any healthy person can do them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: No ti hiker ket pisikal a nakaradkad** - The passage mentions health, but it specifies *easy* trails require little preparation for *any* healthy person.
*   **C: No dagiti ubbing ket ag-hike** - The passage actually says families *with* young children need *more* preparation.
*   **D: No ti hike ket ad-adda iti natural a lawlaw** - The passage doesn’t link the level of natural beauty to preparation needed.



"
Ania ti sabali maipapan kadagiti plateau iti Rogaland wenno Agder a maiyasping iti sabali pay a lugar iti Norway?,"The correct answer is **D: Masansan a nakallubanda ti heather.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Idiay Rogaland ken Agder isuda ket maaw-awagan a “hei” kayatna sawen ket kalbo a kakaykaywan a maab-abbongan laeng ti heather."" (In Rogaland and Agder they are called ""hei"" meaning bare mountains only covered with heather.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adda kaykayoda** - The passage specifically says they are *bare* mountains (""kalbo a kakaykaywan""), meaning they *don't* have trees.
* **B: Awan dagiti fjord** - The first sentence mentions fjords are a characteristic of Norway generally, not specifically excluded from Rogaland/Agder.
* **C: Dagiti plateau ket kaaduan a napatad** - The passage says they are ""napatpatad wenno saan unay a napatad"" (flat or not very flat), meaning they aren't *always* flat.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a normal para ti Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti adu kaykayona a daga** (Areas with many trees).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The ""vidde"" are described as wide, open spaces *without* trees, and the ""hei"" are described as bare ground with only heather. This indicates that large forested areas are *not* typical of the landscapes described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and therefore not the answer:

* **A: Silulukat a nalalawa a dagdaga** (Open, wide areas) - The ""vidde"" directly describes this.
* **C: Dagiti narangkis a fjords** (Magnificent fjords) - The passage begins by stating Norway is known for these.
* **D: Dagiti moorland** (Moorland) - The ""hei"" are described as heather-covered, fitting the definition of moorland.



"
Kaano a masapul a mapan ag-ski dagiti turista tapno mabisita dagiti istasion ti bantay?,"The correct answer is **A: Bayat ti panawen ti niebe** (During the snowy season).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...adda adu nga istasion ti bantay a makaawat ti nasalun-at a kinaado ti niebe ken mangited ti aktibidad kas panag-ski ken panag-snowboard."" (There are many mountain stations that receive good snowfall and offer activities like skiing and snowboarding.)
* This directly links skiing and snowboarding to the *snowy season*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bayat ti panawen a kaaduan ti tattao** (During peak season) - While skiing might *be* popular during peak season, the passage focuses on when the *snow* is available.
* **C: Bayat ti kalgaw ti India** (During the Indian summer) - The passage explicitly says summer is for different types of tourism, *not* skiing.
* **D: Bayat ti spring** (During spring) - Spring may have some snow, but it's not reliable for skiing and snowboarding.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano nga adda ti kaaduan a turista kadagiti istasion ti bantay?","The correct answer is **C: Bayat ti kalgaw ti India**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti panawen ti turista para dagiti istasion ti turod ket masansan nga umado bayat ti kalgaw iti India."" (Tourists often visit mountain stations during the Indian summer.) This directly indicates that the most tourists visit during the Indian summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kabayatan ti napigsa a panagtinnag ti niebe** - While snow is important for these stations, the passage doesn't say *most* tourists come during heavy snowfall.
*   **B: Kabayatan ti panawen ti snowboarding** - Snowboarding is an activity *available* during the snowy season, but doesn’t represent the peak tourist time.
*   **D: Kabayatan dagiti bulan ti niebe** - Similar to A and B, this refers to the season for snow activities, not the busiest time for tourists overall.



"
Ania ti rumbeng a liklikam nga aramiden no namnamaem a makasarakka iti bangka nga agsapsapul iti tulong?,"The correct answer is **A: Magna nga agpangato ken agpababa kadagiti pantalan (Frequently going up and down the docks)**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) describes a method of finding ships needing crew.** It involves being visible and available at the docks, talking to people, gathering information, and generally making your presence known.  Going up and down the docks maximizes your chances of encountering captains or crew looking for help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pannakigayyem kadagiti kapitan (Talking to captains):** While *part* of the process, the passage describes more than just directly asking captains. It's about being in the right place and gathering information from multiple sources.
* **C: Panangiyallukoy kadagiti serbisiom (Availing of services):**  The passage focuses on *offering* your services, not *using* them.
* **D: Saan nga ikaso dagiti kapadam a hitchhiker iti balangay (Don't accuse fellow hitchhikers on the ship):** This is irrelevant to the core strategy described in the passage.



"
Ania ti rumbeng nga aramidem iti aglawlaw dagiti marina no agsapsapulka iti bangka a kasapulan ti tulong?,"The correct answer is **A: Makikontak kadagiti marinero** (Contact sailors).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""Makasinnangomto dagiti dadduma a pumarpara iti barko ken ipakitada dagiti impormasionda kenka."" (Some will stop by the ship and share their information with you.)  and ""pagpagnaem dagiti pagsangladan...padasem ti makisarita kadagiti marino kadagiti bar..."" (investigate harbors...talk to sailors in bars...).  This indicates actively seeking information *from* sailors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agtalinaed iti uneg ti radar** (Stay inside the radar) - The passage focuses on *gathering* information, not staying hidden.
* **C: Papanan laeng dagiti tattao bayat ti panagdalusda ti yate** (Just watch people while they sail their yachts) - This is passive observation, not actively seeking help.
* **D: Liklikan dagiti kapadam a hitchhiker** (Avoid fellow hitchhikers) - The passage is about *finding* people who need help, not avoiding them.



"
Ania a lugar ti mapag-interesan dagiti turista iti kolonial a pakasaritaan ti isla?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Northern shore**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti kadakkelan a parte iti urban a panagpasayaat iti Isla ti Hong Kong ket iramanna a dakkel dagiti nababawi a daga idiay baybay iti amianan. Daytoy ti lugar nga inagom dagiti manangsakop a Briton ken no agbirbirokka iti napalabas a panagsakop dagiti teritorio, nasayaat no mangrugika ditoy a lugar.""

This directly translates to: ""The largest part of the urban development on Hong Kong Island consists of large areas of reclaimed land on the *north shore*. This is the area settled by the British and if you are looking for evidence of past territorial occupation, it is best to start in this area.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti Kowloon waterfront:** The passage mentions Kowloon, but focuses on the history relating to the *island* and specifically the north shore.
*   **C: Ti Downtown Hong Kong:** While downtown Hong Kong is on the island, the passage doesn't specifically highlight it for colonial history.
*   **D: Ti Victoria Harbor:** Victoria Harbor is a scenic location, but the passage focuses on the land *along* the north shore as the site of British settlement.



"
Ania a lugar ti makaited ti interes ti turista nga ipangpangrunana dagiti napipintas a makita?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti Isla iti Hong Kong** (The Island of Hong Kong).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Inikkkan ti Isla ti Hong Kong iti teritorio ti Hongkong iti nagan ken ti lugar nga adu a turista a mangipagarup a kangrunaan a naipamaysa."" (The Island of Hong Kong gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.)
* The passage then goes on to describe the sights *on* the Island of Hong Kong – the skyline, Victoria Harbour views *from* the island, and the historical significance found *there*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti Victoria Harbor:** While beautiful, Victoria Harbour is a *feature* seen *from* the Island of Hong Kong, not the primary tourist focus itself according to the passage.
* **B: Ti Hong Kong proper:** This is too broad.  The passage specifically highlights the Island.
* **D: Ti Kowloon waterfront:**  The passage mentions Kowloon as a place you look *to* from the Island, but doesn't position it as the main attraction.



"
Ania ti sumagmamano a saddle a makatulong a makissayan ti peggad ti saka ti sumakay a saan a maisigkat iti stirrup?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti naakikid a sole** (Narrow soles).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Umuna, kaaduan kadagiti agsakay ket agisuot ti botas a panglugan nga addaan iti takon ken **nalamuyot, akikid, a suelas**."" (First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and *smooth, narrow soles*.) This is directly mentioned as a way to prevent the foot from getting stuck in the stirrup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti bar ti kinatalged** (Safety bars) - The passage doesn't mention safety bars.
*   **C: Dagiti leather a stirrup** (Leather stirrups) - The passage discusses the *danger* of stirrups themselves, not a specific type of stirrup material.
*   **D: Ad-adda nga istabilidad** (More stability) - While stability is important, the passage focuses on preventing the foot from *getting stuck*, not simply improving stability.



"
Ania a langa ti botas a pangsakay ti makatulong iti kintalged ti sumakay no agus-usar kadagiti stirrup?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa a heel** (A heel).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Umuna, kaaduan kadagiti agsakay ket agisuot ti botas a panglugan nga addaan iti **takon** ken nalamuyot, akikid, a suelas."" (First, most riders wear riding boots that have a **heel** and a smooth, tight sole.)

The heel prevents the foot from sliding *through* the stirrup in case of a fall, which is the main safety concern addressed in the passage. While a tight sole is also important, it's the heel that directly addresses the risk of getting your foot caught.



"
Ania ti maidiaya kadagiti biahero babaen kadagiti network iti pinagsisinnukat ti hospitalidad?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti pagdagusan kadua dagiti lokal a mangpadagus** (Accommodation with locals).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti network iti pinagsisinnukat ti hospitalidad ket iti organisasion a mangtiptipon dagiti biahero kadagiti lokal iti siudad a papananda."" (The hospitality exchange network is an organization that brings together travelers with locals in the city they are visiting.) This directly points to offering accommodation through locals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nalaka a biahe ti eroplano** (Easy airplane travel) - The passage mentions a plane trip as *how* the founder got the idea, but it's not what the network *provides*.
* **C: Dagiti biahe nga ipaay dagiti lokal a mannarabay** (Trips provided by local payers) - The networks are about *receiving* hospitality, not getting paid trips.
* **D: Dagiti koneksion kadagiti sabali pay nga agbibiahe a bumis-bisita iti agpada a destinasion** (Connections with other travelers visiting the same destination) - While connections *might* happen, the core offering is the accommodation itself.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan kadagiti network ti hospitality exhange ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti agbi-biahe ket kanayon a naikkan kadagiti reperensia para kadagiti lokal a host.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ti listaan dagiti mabalin a mangpadagus ket maited a mabalin a kas naimprenta ken/wenno online, no maminsan adda pay panagsapul ken panangadal iti dadduma nga agbibiahe."" This means a *list* of potential hosts is provided, and sometimes there's a request for *reviews* or checking the travelers.  It doesn't say travelers are *always* given references *for* the hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Ti sumagmamano a network ket mabalin nga agkasapulan ti kanayonan a beripikasion kadagiti agbi-biahe** -  The passage explicitly states: ""nupay ti dadduma a network, mangisingasing wenno agsapul iti nayonna pay a beripikasion.""
* **C: Dagiti agbi-biahe ket maipaayanto ti listaan dagiti sidadaan a host iti siudad a destinasion** - This is a direct interpretation of the sentence about lists of potential hosts.
* **D: Dagiti repaso dagiti lokal a host ket no maminsan sidadaan met kadagiti agbi-biahe** - The passage implies this with the mention of ""panagsapul ken panangadal"" (requesting and checking) of travelers.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kita ti bisita ti basbassit ti posibilidadna a masarakan iti shared hostel room?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a bisita nga agbi-biahe kadua dagiti babassit pay nga ubbing**.

Here's why:

The text states that while families *can* be found in hostels, they are usually accommodated in *private rooms*. This means they are less likely to be in the shared rooms. The other options (young adults, solo travelers, and people in their thirties) are all explicitly mentioned as common hostel guests.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti ad-adda a makitam a maturog iti maysa a hostel?","The correct answer is **B: Tallo nga agtawen ti 22 nga agbi-biahe nga agkakadua** (Three 22-year-olds traveling together).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Iserbian dagiti hostel kangrunaan dagiti agtutubo – iti gagangay a bisita ket adda edad duapulo – ngem masansan a masarakam met dagiti adulto a managbiahe."" (Hostels are mainly for young people – the typical visitor is twenty years old – but adults traveling can sometimes be found.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While families *can* be found, the text says they're often in private rooms, not the typical hostel dorm.
* **C:** The text states hostels are primarily for *young* people. 70-year-olds don't fit this demographic.
* **D:** Again, families are typically in private rooms, not the general dorm setting described.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagibato ti boomerang?","The correct answer is **D: Sumagmamano a boomerang laeng ti makasubli**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kaaduan a boomerang a magatang idiay Australia ket agpayso a saan agsubsubli."" (Most boomerangs bought in Australia are likely not to return.) This directly supports the idea that *not all* boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agsubli latta daytoy iti imam no kusto ti pannakaibatona** - The passage actually cautions that even with a good boomerang, wind can affect its return.
* **B: Daytoy ket popular kadagiti lokal ngem kadagiti turista** - The passage states the opposite: ""Ti panangibato ti boomerang ket maysa a nalatak a paglaingan a kayat a magun-od ti adu a turista."" (Throwing a boomerang is a popular activity that many tourists want to experience.)
* **C: Awan ti adu a boomerang a sidadaan iti Australia** - The passage doesn't mention the *quantity* of boomerangs available, only that many of those *bought* don't return.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kangrunaan a maus-usar iti Javanese nga istilo ti panagluto?,"The correct answer is **C: Asukar manipud ti inyog**.

The passage specifically states: ""...ken nadumaduma nga aromatiko a pagtimpla. **aglalo ti asukar ti niyog a Javanese**..."" (and various aromatic seasonings, **especially Javanese coconut sugar**).

Therefore, coconut sugar is a key ingredient in Javanese cooking.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano nga agwaras ti makaakar a sakit?","The correct answer is **A: Naimpeksionan a tattao** (Infected people).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti maysa a makaakar a sakit ket maysa a sakit a nadaras a maiakar babaen iti panagdian iti aglawlaw ti napalabas a tao."" This translates to: ""A communicable disease is a disease that is easily spread through contact with a previous person.""

Therefore, communicable diseases spread *from* infected people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti pathogen** (Pathogens) - While pathogens *cause* communicable diseases, they aren't how the disease spreads. They need a host (a person) to travel.
* **C: Bacterium** (Bacterium) - A bacterium is a *type* of pathogen, not the method of spread.
* **D: Dagiti panagpabakuna** (Vaccinations) - Vaccinations *prevent* communicable diseases, they don't spread them.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti saan nga ammo a gapu dagiti makaimpeksion a sakit?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti panagpabakuna**.

Here's why:

The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi. It *also* mentions vaccines are *required* to prevent the spread of these diseases.  The question asks what is **not** a cause of infectious diseases. Vaccines *prevent* them, they don't cause them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti virus** - The passage explicitly states viruses can cause infectious diseases.
*   **C: Bacteria** - The passage explicitly states bacteria can cause infectious diseases.
*   **D: Fungus** - The passage explicitly states fungi can cause infectious diseases.



"
Iti ania a kasasaad a naan-anay para ti mangus-usar a pilien ti web proxy ngem ti personal a tagaipaay ti VPN?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti mangus-usar ket agdama a kangrunaan a mangire-reroute ti trapiko iti http**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that web proxies are limited to HTTP traffic, while VPNs can encrypt *all* internet traffic.  If a user *only* needs to reroute HTTP traffic, a web proxy is sufficient and might be chosen over the more robust (and likely more expensive) VPN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kayat ti mangus-usar nga i-reroute amin a trapiko:**  The passage says VPNs are better for this – proxies can't handle all traffic.
* **B: Pakaseknan ti mangus-usar ti panangliklik ti censorship ken panagespiya no mabalin:** VPNs are specifically mentioned as better for bypassing censorship and espionage due to their encryption.
* **D: Dagiti aktibidad ti mangus-usar ket mangikasapulan ti kalalainganna agingga ti nangato a lebel ti bandwidth:** The passage states VPNs generally offer higher bandwidth and better service quality.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan kadagiti VPN ken web proxies ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti VPN ket maiyallatiwna laeng ti trapiko iti http**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that VPNs *can* encrypt **all** Internet traffic, not just HTTP. Option D contradicts this directly.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

*   **A: Dagiti VPN ket kadawyan a mangidatag ti nangat-ngato a bandwidth ngem kadagiti web proxy** - The text says ""Normal a mangidatagdaiti nangatngato a bandwith..."" supporting this statement.
*   **B: Dagiti web proxy ket saanna a maiyallatiw amin a trapiko iti web** - The text states that VPNs are able to encrypt all internet traffic, implying proxies cannot.
*   **C: Dagiti web proxy ket addaan iti nababbaba a kalidad ti serbisio no maiyasping kadagiti VPN** - The text says VPNs have ""nagsasayaat a kalidaditi serbisio"" meaning proxies have a lower quality.



"
Ania ti mangpalubos ti maysa a tao a mangusar ti kompania ti telepono iti ruar ti nagannat a lugarda?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti nai-route ti internet a tawag** (Internet-routed calls).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Agsipud ta maidalan dagiti awag ket maidalan iti Internet, saanmon a kasapulan ti kompania ti telepono a masarakan iti lugar a pagtalinaedam wenno papanam."" (Because calls can be made over the Internet, you don't need a phone company located where you live or work.) This directly points to internet-routed calls as the enabling factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti sangalubongan a numero ti telepono** (International phone numbers) - While mentioned in the passage, they are a *result* of the technology, not the *cause* of being able to use a phone company remotely.
* **C: Dagiti satellite** (Satellites) - Satellites *provide* internet access in remote areas, but it's the internet connection itself that allows the phone service to be independent of location.
* **D: Dagiti PSTN a telepono** (PSTN phones) - PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone system, and the passage highlights how this technology is *not* required anymore to achieve remote phone service.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasapulan a maaramid tapno makaawat kadagiti partikular a tawag?","The correct answer is **A: Gumatang ti sangalubongan a numero**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masansan, masapul nga aggatangka ti nailasin a sangalubungan a numero a mabalin a matawaganka iti telepono a PSTN. No sadino daydiay a numero ket agbaliw para kadagiti tattao a tumawtawag kenka."" This directly implies that to *receive* calls, you often need a specific international number that people can dial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agusar ti lokal a kompania ti telepono:** The passage explicitly states you *don't* need a local phone company.
* **C: Gumun-od ti numero manipud ti lokal a komunidadmo:** The passage states you *don't* need a local number.
* **D: Gumatang ti PSTN a telepono:** While a PSTN phone can *receive* calls, the passage focuses on the need for a specific number, not the *type* of phone.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti panagebkas kadagiti Italian a sarita?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti panagebkas kadagiti kaaduan a sarita ket agduduma depende iti sumaruno a vowel.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""iti panangbalikasda [c ken g] ket agduduma bayat ti sumaruno a patinig"" (their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel). This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti doble nga r ket maiyebkas nga agsabali ngem ti maysa nga r:** The passage explicitly says this: ""siguraduem a balikasen ti r ken rr nga agsabali"" (make sure to pronounce r and rr differently).
* **B: Kaaduan kadagiti sarita ket maiyebkas no kasanoda a maisurat:** The passage starts with ""Ti panagbalikas ket relatibo a nalaka iti Italiano gapu ta ti adu a sarita ket mabalikas nga eksakto no kasanoda maisurat."" (Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because many words are pronounced exactly as written).
* **C: Dagiti sarita nga addaan kadagiti letra a c ken g ket mabalin a makatikaw:** The passage identifies 'c' and 'g' as letters that *require* attention because their pronunciation changes, making them potentially tricky (makatikaw).



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a naggapuan a karakteristik ti Izmir sakbay ti moderno a panawen?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti nalabaga a baldosa nga atep** (Tiled roofs).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""iti maika-18 siglo a palengke, daan a moske ken simbaan, uray no ti siudad mas addaan atmosperana a kasla Mediterranean Europe ngem tradisional a Turkey.""  This implies the tiled roofs (and old mosques and churches) are remnants of its older character, predating the modern, bustling city it is today.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti nalawa a kalsada** (Wide roads) - These are a characteristic of the *modern* city.
*   **B: Istruktura a sarming ti ruarna** (Mirror-like exteriors) - This describes the modern buildings.
*   **C: Dagiti sentro ti paggatangan** (Shopping centers) - These are also a product of the city's modern development.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a karakteristik ti Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti atmosphere ket mangiyanninaw ti tradisional a Turkey**.

The passage explicitly states: ""uray no ti siudad mas addaan atmosperana a kasla Mediterranean Europe ngem tradisional a Turkey"" (even though the city has more of a Mediterranean Europe atmosphere than traditional Turkey). This means its atmosphere *doesn't* feel traditionally Turkish.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Ti siudad ket manglikmut iti dakkel a baybay** - The passage states it's ""naipasdek iti aglawlaw ti dakkel a luek"" (situated in the embrace of a large bay).
* **C: Mabirukam dagiti moderno a sentro ti paggatangan ken dagiti daan a simbaan** - The passage mentions ""moderno a sentro ti paggatangan"" (modern shopping centers) and ""daan a moske ken simbaan"" (old mosques and churches).
* **D: Adda ditoy ti maikadua a kadakkelan a puerto iti Turkey** - The passage directly states it's ""ti maikadua a kadakkelan a porto kalpasan ti Istanbul"" (the second largest port after Istanbul).



"
Ti sarita nga hanami ket maipapan ti panabuya ti ania?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti cherry blossom**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti panagbuya iti **cherry blossom**, maaw-awagan a hanami..."" (The admiration of **cherry blossoms**, also known as hanami...) This establishes that hanami is about appreciating cherry blossoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti aristokrasia ti Hapon:** While the passage mentions the aristocracy *participated* in early hanami, the story isn't *about* them.
* **C: Dagiti plum blossom:**  The passage states hanami originated with *plum* blossoms in China, but it then shifted to cherry blossoms in Japan. The story focuses on the Japanese tradition.
* **D: Ti Imperial a Korte:**  The Imperial Court *hosted* the early celebrations, but the subject of the celebrations was the cherry blossoms.



"
Siasino ti nag-host ti umuna a party a naidedikar ti panangkita kadagiti cherry blossom?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti emperador ti Hapon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Idiay Japan, dagiti pagraragsak para ti umuna a cherry blossom ket i-host ti emperador para laeng iti bagbagina ken dadduma a miyembro iti aristokrasia."" (In Japan, the celebrations for the first cherry blossom were hosted by the emperor for his courtiers and other members of the aristocracy.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti emperador ti Tsina** - The passage says the *concept* came from China, but the parties were hosted by the Japanese emperor.
*   **B: Dagiti Hapon nga aristocrat** - While aristocrats *attended*, the emperor *hosted* the parties.
*   **D: Dagiti Tsino nga aristocrat** - The parties described in the passage took place in Japan, not China."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga aspeto ti Jerusalem a saan unay a maka-interes iti turista?","The correct answer is **B: Ti estado kas ti kapital a siudad ti Israel**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many nations and the United Nations *do not* recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is a fact *about* Jerusalem, it's presented as a point of contention, not something inherently attractive to tourists.

The passage *highlights* the following as tourist draws:

*   **A: Ti kinapateg ti relihion iti siudad** - It's a holy city for three major religions.
*   **C: Dagiti kultural a maidiayana** - It has many cultural sites.
*   **D: Ti adu a historikal a site** - It has numerous historical and archaeological sites.

Therefore, the capital city status is the least likely to be a primary *interest* for a tourist based on the information provided in the passage."
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas banag a popular iti Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **B: Ti politikal nga impluwensia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**
    * **A: Ti nakaskasdaaw a pakasaritaanna** - ""Ti kadaanan a siudad ti Judean Hills ket addaan nakaskasdaaw a pakasaritaan a mairaman iti rinibu a tawen.""
    * **C: Ti kinapateg ti relihion** - ""Ti siudad ket nasantuan para iti tallo a monoteistiko a relihion - Hudaismo, Kristianismo ken Islam...""
    * **D: Dagiti kultural a site** - ""Ti Jerusalem ket addaan iti adu nga agkakauna, arkeolohia ken kultural a lugar...""

* **The passage does NOT mention:** While the passage *implies* political controversy regarding its status as a capital, it doesn't explicitly state that political influence *itself* is a popular attraction or characteristic *of* Jerusalem. It focuses on its history, religion, and cultural sites.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti agbi-biahe ti saan a makabenepisio ti panaggatang ti Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa nga agbi-biahe a bumis-bisita laeng iti Kruger National Park.**

Here's why:

The text states the Wild Card ""allows access to any of the selected parks in South Africa or all National Parks of South Africa.""  If someone is *only* visiting Kruger National Park, they don't need the Wild Card to benefit, as they can simply pay the daily conservation fee for Kruger. The Wild Card is advantageous when visiting *multiple* parks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:**  The Wild Card *is* beneficial for someone planning to visit many SANParks.
*   **C:** Budget is irrelevant; the benefit of the Wild Card is access, not cost.
*   **D:** Someone visiting a National Park and one other park would definitely benefit from a Wild Card.



"
Ania kadagiti keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a mangiladawan ti Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Daytoy ti kabassitan kadagiti South African National Park.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Kruger National Park covers 19,500 km².** This is a *large* area, meaning it is *not* the smallest.
* **A: Maikonsiderar dayoty kas kangrunaan nga atraksion iti South Africa** - The passage states it's a ""major attraction"" and ""flagship"" park.
* **B: Ti wildfire ket agduduma kadagiti adu nga ecozone ti parke** - The passage mentions the park has 14 different ecozones, so wildfires could affect them.
* **D: Maakses daytoy dagiti bisita babaen ti panaggatang ti Wild Card** - The passage explicitly states the Wild Card allows access to the park.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti ad-adda mangigapu ti peggad para kadagiti umuli babaen kadagiti narangkis a paset ti bantay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti nabasa a kondision (Wet conditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*namnaem a maibusanka iti anges, ket aggannadka kadagiti parte a natadem, aglalo no nabasa, ket mabalin a nadaras a delikado daytoy.*"" (It is easy to slip on the stones, and the steep parts become slippery, especially when wet, and can be quite dangerous).

This directly links wet conditions to increased danger and the risk of slipping on the steep, rocky parts of the mountain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti bato nga addang (Rocky steps):** While the path *is* rocky, the passage doesn't say the rocks themselves cause the danger, but rather the slipperiness *on* the rocks.
*   **C: Dagiti bassit a kueba (Small caves):** The caves are mentioned as a landmark near the path, not as a hazard.
*   **D: Dagiti cable a landok (Rope cables):** The cables are *supportive* and provide assistance, so they don't pose a danger.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan a nakanatad a manganninaw ti kangato ti bantay ti Machu Picchu a nailadawan iti mabasa?,"The correct answer is **B: Awan dagiti handrail kadagiti narangrangkis a paset**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""dagiti landok a kable ti mangmangted iti suporta a pagigianan."" This means there *are* cables to help with the climb, not that there are *no* handrails.
* **A:** The passage explicitly says people *can* slip on the ice.
* **C:** The passage mentions a cave *needs* to be passed, not that it's required to wear something in it.
* **D:** The passage directly states ""namnaem a maibusanka iti anges, ket aggannadka kadagiti parte a natadem, aglalo no nabasa, ket mabalin a nadaras a delikado daytoy."" (it's easy to slip on ice, and the steep parts are especially dangerous when wet). This is a description of the danger, not a statement that there's a lack of safety features.

Therefore, the only statement that isn't supported by the text is that there are no handrails.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagitoy ti saan a kangrunaan a makan ti Majorcan nga istilo ti panagluto?","The correct answer is **C: Bukel**.

Here's why:

The passage states Majorcan cuisine is based on **bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork)**, and uses olive oil. While it doesn't *exclude* fruit, it doesn't list it as a base ingredient like the others.

* **Karne (A):** Specifically mentioned as a major component (especially pork).
* **Tinapay (B):** Listed as a base of the cuisine.
* **Nateng (D):** Listed as a base of the cuisine.
* **Bukel (C):** Not mentioned as a base ingredient in the passage."
"Segun iti impormasion iti mabasa, ania a keddeng maipapan kadagiti hangi a taraon ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **A: Ti geothermal hangi ket mangus-usar kadagiti napudot a bato manipud ti puor tapno papuduten ti pit.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Daydiay nga abut ket mabalin a napapudot bayat iti napudot a batbato gapu iti apoy, wenno iti dadduma a lugar iti pudot a geothermal ket isu ti natural nga agpapudot dagiti lugar iti daga."" This directly describes geothermal hangi using hot stones from the earth to cook food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti hangi babaen kadagiti napudot a bato ket sidadaan iti Wellington** - The passage *mentions* Wellington as a place where hangi can be found, but doesn’t say it’s where it originated.
* **C: Dagiti natuno a pangrabii ket masansan a malutluto iti hangi** -  While the passage says hangi *is* used for traditional cooking, it doesn't state it's specifically for overnight cooking.
* **D: Ti geothermal a hangi ket mabalin a mabirukan iti Rotorua** - The passage *mentions* Rotorua as a place with geothermal hangi, but the question asks about the *principle* of non-artificial hangi – which is the use of hot stones.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga kas normal a wagas tapno mapapudot ti hangi pit?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaas**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions these methods for heating a hangi pit:

*   **Napudot nga abut (Hot stones)** - mentioned multiple times
*   **Apoy (Fire)** - used to heat the stones
*   **Geothermal a pudot (Geothermal heat)** - described as a natural source of heat

The passage **does not** mention using gas to heat the hangi pit.

Therefore, **Gaas (Gas)** is the only option that isn't described in the passage as a normal way to heat a hangi pit.



"
Ania ti mabalin nga agresulta ti naisingsingayan a panagbigbig manipud ti monghe wenno madre?,"The correct answer is **C: Panangbulod ti kalub manipud ti monasterio** (Borrowing robes from the monastery).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...no nangitugotka ti bukodmo, aglalo no natingra dagiti marisna, isemannaka kadagiti monghe wenno madre iti pagserrekan."" This directly translates to ""...if you allow yourself, especially if your clothes are torn, you can ask the monks or nuns to borrow robes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagisuot ti naraniag a pangkalub** (Wearing bright robes) - The passage doesn't mention bright robes, just borrowing robes.
*   **B: Panangkalub kadagiti abagam** (Covering the arms) - The passage discusses covering legs and heads, not arms.
*   **D: Nakasuot iti palda a naputed iti ngatuen ti tumeng** (Wearing a skirt that reaches the knee) - While skirts are mentioned for women, this isn't the *result* of asking a monk or nun for help, but rather a general rule of dress.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a banbanag ti bado ti saan unay a sidadaan a mabulod manipud ti monasterio? ,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti palda**.

Here's why:

The text states that women are *required* to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders, and monasteries often provide them for those who don't have them. Men are required to wear long pants, which are sometimes provided but may not be comfortable. Shorts and kalub (likely referring to a type of covering) aren't mentioned as being provided or required. Therefore, skirts are the item most readily available/offered by the monasteries.



"
Kaano nga addaan ti maysa a bisita ti kaaduan nga oportunidad a makita dagiti bituen bayat ti panagbisita kadagiti lugar iti Antartica?,"The correct answer is **D: No ti lebel ti polusion iti silaw ket nababa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...gapu ta ti lugar ket saan unay a natao, ket ngarud saan a masansan a parikut ti polusion ti lawag, mabalinmo pay ragsaken a buyaen dagiti bituen."" This directly links the ability to see stars to low light pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayat dagiti bulan ti kalgaw:** While the passage mentions the polar night (long periods of darkness), it doesn't specifically connect star-gazing to the summer months.
* **B: No awan unay tao iti maysa a lugar:**  This is *related* to the reason why star-gazing is good (low light pollution), but isn't the direct condition.  The lack of people *causes* low light pollution.
* **C: Bayat dagiti bulan ti niebe:**  Snow itself doesn't necessarily improve star-gazing. It can even reflect light and make it harder to see faint stars.



"
Kaano a saan a mabalin a maisukat ti satellite nga telepono iti maysa a cell phone?,"The correct answer is **A: No mabalin a malapdan ti sight line nga agturong iti satellite**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""kasapulam a mapan iti ruar nga adda ti nalawag a linya iti kita idiay satellite tapno makaaramidka ti tawag."" (you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call).  If that line of sight is blocked, the satellite phone won't work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: No adayo unay ti lokasion:** The passage says satellite phones are *used* in remote locations, implying they *can* work there. Distance isn't the primary issue, it's the line of sight.
* **C: No mausarto iti ruar:** The passage explicitly states you *need* to be outside.
* **D: No ti panagbiahe ket mangikasapulan kadagiti partikular a kasapulan ti data:** The passage says they're used for expeditions needing data, so this isn't a reason they wouldn't work.



"
Kaano a maipangpangruna ti satellite a telepono ngem ti cell phone?,"The correct answer is **B: Bayat ti panagbalangay (While hiking)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Satellite phones are used in remote areas *where cell phone service is unavailable*. Hiking often takes you to such remote locations.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Bayat ti panagbakasion iti siudad (While on vacation in the city):** Cell phone service is generally good in cities.
    * **C: No saan a kasapulanen ti remote a data (If remote data is not needed):** The passage mentions satellite phones *for* remote data and calls.
    * **D: No ad-adda nga addaan ka ti naan-anay a masakupan ti cell phone (If you have good cell phone coverage):** This is the opposite of when you'd need a satellite phone.



"
Ti parikut ti ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nangigapu ti pannakaaramid ti Transnistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **B: Etnisidad**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Moldova is a ""multi-ethnic republic experiencing ethnic tensions."" It then directly links those tensions to the creation of the Transnistria Republic in 1994.  While economic factors may be *involved*, the root cause described in the passage is the ethnic conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ekonomia** - While the text mentions economic ties still existing, it doesn't state the economy *caused* the split.
*   **C: Lengguahe** - Language is mentioned as a characteristic of Moldova (Romanian and Russian use), but not as the primary driver of the conflict.
*   **D: Relihion** - Religion (Orthodox Christianity) is stated as a characteristic, not a cause of the division.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti adda iti Transnistria Republic a sabali manipud ti sabali pay a lugar ti intero a Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Currency**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Transnistria Republic has its *own currency* but is not recognized by any UN member state.  The other options are shared with the rest of Moldova:

*   **A: Language:** Romanian is the official language of Moldova, and while Russian is widely used, that's true in Transnistria as well.
*   **B: Religion:** Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in all of Moldova.
*   **C: UN recognition:** Neither Moldova nor Transnistria has full, universal UN recognition (Transnistria specifically is *not* recognized).



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a bisitaen ti maysa nga agbi-biahe ti Montevideo no kayatda a liklikan dagiti naangin a kondision ti panawen?","The correct answer is **C: Bayat dagiti bulan ti kalgaw iti Northern Hemisphere**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gapu ta ti Montevideo ket abagatan ti Ekuador, panawen ti kalgaw idiay no panawen ti lam-ek idiay Makin-amianan a Hemispero ken agbinnatliktad."" This means when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's winter (and therefore potentially windy) in Montevideo.  The text also states Montevideo has warm temperatures in its summer (during the Northern Hemisphere's winter).  Therefore, to avoid windy conditions, a traveler should visit during the Northern Hemisphere's summer (Montevideo's winter/warmest period).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bayat dagiti bulan ti niebe iti Northern Hemisphere:** The Northern Hemisphere's winter (snowy months) corresponds to summer in Montevideo, which the text suggests can be windy.
*   **B: Bayat ti panawen ti panagmaga ti Montevideo:** The text specifically says Montevideo doesn't have a distinct ""dry"" season.
*   **D: Bayat dagiti bulan ti niebe iti Montevideo:** Montevideo doesn't have snowy months as it has a subtropical climate.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a bisitaen ti agbi-biahe ti Montevideo no partial-da ti nalam-lammiis a klima?","The correct answer is **A: No kalgaw iti Montevideo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gapu ta ti Montevideo ket abagatan ti Ekuador, panawen ti kalgaw idiay no panawen ti lam-ek idiay Makin-amianan a Hemispero ken agbinnatliktad."" This means that summer in Montevideo (which is when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere) is hot.  The text also mentions that while temperatures are generally mild, wind and humidity can *make it feel* colder. Therefore, someone who prefers cooler weather should visit during Montevideo's summer (our winter).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: No kalgaw iti Northern Hemisphere** - This would be the hottest time in Montevideo.
*   **C: No panawen ti tudo iti Montevideo** - The text says rain is consistent throughout the year, so this wouldn't guarantee cooler weather.
*   **D: No panawen ti niebe iti Northern Hemisphere** -  The text doesn’t mention snow and this refers to a completely different hemisphere’s climate.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti mainaig ti nalaing nga artista ti graffiti, kas maisuppiat ti bandalismo?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti pasamak ti graffiti** (Graffiti events).

Here's why:

The passage states that while graffiti *can* be seen as vandalism (unwanted markings), there's a growing scene of **established graffiti artists, graffiti events, and ""legal"" walls for painting.** This implies that skilled graffiti artists are involved in organized and accepted forms of the art, differentiating them from simple vandalism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dagiti Scribble** (Scribbles) - Scribbles are the very thing graffiti artists *move beyond* to create art.
* **C: Saan nga ipangpangruna a mural iti publiko a tagikua** (Uncommissioned murals on public property) - While this *could* be graffiti, the passage focuses on the distinction between vandalism and *skilled artistry*.
* **D: Dagiti saan a mabasa a tag** (Unreadable tags) -  This describes a common element of *vandalistic* graffiti, not the work of a skilled artist.



"
Ania nga aspeto dagiti fiesta ti musika ti ikonsiderar dagiti mapmapan a napateg a paset ti kapadasan?,"The correct answer is **D: Pannakastrek a nasapa (Arriving early)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""No kayatmo a talaga nga asideg iti aksion kasapulam a mapan a nasapa idiay pagkarsonan nga asideg ti musika."" This directly links arriving early to being a key part of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

*   **A: Panangitugot kadagiti ubbing (Allowing children)** - The passage *mentions* family camping for those with children, but doesn't say it's a key aspect of the overall experience for *everyone*.
*   **B: Panagkampo iti site (Camping on site)** - Similar to A, it's a feature for some, but not central to the experience for all attendees.
*   **C: Panag-play ti musika iti naladaw a rabii (Playing music late into the night)** - While the passage notes music continues after the main stages, it doesn't frame this *as* a key aspect of the experience, just a continuation of it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti rumbeng nga ipangpangruna ti festival attendant no kayatda ti agkampo iti asideg ti musika?","The correct answer is **D: Pannakastrek a nasapa** (Arriving early).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""No kayatmo a talaga nga asideg iti aksion kasapulam a mapan a nasapa idiay pagkarsonan nga asideg ti musika."" This directly translates to needing to arrive early at the camping area near the music if you want to be close to the action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagapan iti naladaw a rabii** (Staying up late) - While the passage mentions music continuing late, it doesn't say this is important for *getting* a good camping spot.
*   **B: Panagtalinaed iti lugar para kadagiti pamilia** (Staying in the family area) - The passage mentions a family camping area, but doesn't suggest it's the place to be if you want to be close to the music.
*   **C: Panagkampo iti saan iti site** (Camping off-site) - The passage is about camping *at* the festival, close to the music.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno ti liklikan dagiti bisita no agbirbirokda ti biag iti rabii iti amianan ti New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti babassit a lugar iti pagraragsakan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agan-annad: dagiti babassit a lugar iti pagraragsakan ditoy ket saan a kanayon a nasayaat a lugar a pagnaedan dagiti bisita a aggapu iti ruar ti estado."" (Translation: Warning: the small entertainment venues here are not always good places for visitors from out of state).  This directly indicates visitors should *avoid* these places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti pueblo:** The passage says you need to travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe for a good nightlife *because of* the pueblos, not that you should avoid them.
*   **C: Dagiti mall:** Malls are not mentioned in the context of nightlife.
*   **D: Dagiti casino:** The passage suggests casinos *are* a viable option, especially the larger ones in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno a makabirok ti bisita kadagiti popular a panangliwliwa iti amianan ti New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Iti casino asideg ti Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that larger casinos with well-known brands are primarily found in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. While it cautions about smaller establishments in other areas, it explicitly mentions that casinos near Santa Fe offer popular entertainment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iti casino dua nga oras manipud ti Albuquerque:** The passage doesn't specifically say casinos *two hours* from Albuquerque are the popular ones, just Albuquerque itself.
* **B: Iti adayo a pueblo:** The passage actually implies the opposite – staying in remote pueblos isn't ideal without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
* **D: Iti bar iti babassit nga ili:** The passage *warns* against these, saying they aren't always safe or suitable for out-of-state visitors.



"
Dagiti addaan ti strikto a budget nga agbi-biahe ket mabalin a kayatda a maliklikan ti ania a tipo ti mainum?,"The correct answer is **B: Nakabote a danum (Bottled water)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ti local a danum ti gripo ket natalged nga inumen, ngem ti danum a nakabotelia ket nalaka a sapulen no mabutengka."" (Local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but bottled water is easily expensive if you're thirsty.)

This directly implies that bottled water is the item a budget traveler would want to avoid, as it can quickly add up in cost compared to the free tap water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Australian a wine:** The text only says New Zealand and Australian wines *might* be good, not that they're expensive.
*   **C: Lokal a serbesa (Local beer):** The text describes the local beers as ""not complicated, but good and refreshing,"" implying they are reasonably priced.
*   **D: Juice ti prutas (Fruit juice):** The text says fruit is ""expensive but good"", not that the juice itself is expensive.



"
"Segun iti lugar a nailadawan iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad nga order ti mainum ti makatikaw iti maysa a tagaserbi?","The correct answer is **A: Ti ababa a nangisit**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Para kadagiti Australiano, ganggannaet ti kapanunotan a 'daplat a puraw' a kape. 'Espresso' ti ababa a nangisit..."" This implies that ordering ""ti ababa a nangisit"" (espresso) is a standard or typical order, especially for Australians.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ti Numero Uno:** While mentioned as a local beer, it's described as simple and refreshing, not necessarily a common or defining order.
* **C: Maysa a Sauvignon Blanc manipud ti New Zealand:** The passage suggests New Zealand wines are *good* to travel with, but doesn't imply they are frequently ordered *in* the place being described.
* **D: Ti daplat a puraw:** This is a type of coffee preferred by Australians, but the passage states it's their *usual* order, while ""ti ababa a nangisit"" is what they would order *instead* (espresso).



"
"Nagpaut iti tallo a siglo, ti panawen ti kolonisasion ket nirugianan ti ania a grupo?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti Kastila** (The Spanish).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nangrugi idi naipasdek ti Asuncion idi 1537, nabaelan ti Paraguay nga agtalinaed ti adu a lokal a karakter ken kinasiasinoda."" and ""ti panawen ti panagsakopda a nagtultuloy iti tallo a siglo."" This clearly indicates that the Spanish began the three-century period of colonization after establishing Asuncion in 1537.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti Payaguá** - The passage states they were *inhabitants* of the Chaco region, not colonizers.
*   **B: Dagiti Guaycurú** - Similar to the Payaguá, they were indigenous groups living in the region.
*   **C: Dagiti Guaraní** - They were the original inhabitants, but the passage states they were fought *against* by the Spanish, not that they initiated colonization.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasayaatan a wagas a makatungtong ti nasayaat ti maysa a Parisian?","The correct answer is **A: Padasen a tuladen ti ugali ti maysa a Parisian**.

Here's why:

The passage states the best way to survive in Paris is to ""blend in, becoming like a 'bien élevé' (well-mannered person)."" This directly implies that *imitating the behavior of Parisians* is key to being accepted and avoiding negative reactions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mangipakita ti pammati ti bagim (Showing your wealth):** The passage actually suggests Parisians *dislike* displays of wealth (""flashy displays"").
* **C: Agbalin a nadayaw (Becoming famous):** Fame isn't mentioned as a way to be well-received.
* **D: Mangipakita ti mannakigimong a panagtignay (Showing friendly interaction):** While politeness is important, the passage focuses on *adopting the specific mannerisms* of Parisians to avoid offense.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikonsiderar a stereotypical a kalidad dagiti Parisian?","The correct answer is **C: Mannakiay-ayam**.

Here's why:

The passage states Parisians *have a reputation* for being shallow, rude, and arrogant. It then immediately says this is mostly untrue. The passage doesn't mention Parisians being prone to flattery (mannakiay-ayam). In fact, it implies the opposite - they quickly lose respect for those who show too much deference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kinapangas:** The passage explicitly states Parisians are reputed to be arrogant (pangas).
*   **B: Kinabastos:** The passage explicitly states Parisians are reputed to be rude (bastos).
*   **D: Kinamadagdagus:** While not a direct word, the passage implies Parisians are quick to lose respect (""mapukaw a dagus"") if certain social graces are not observed.



"
Ania ti benepisio ti First Class iti MetroRail ti Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Awan unay tattao**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mas kumportable ken awan unay taona iti Metroplus..."" This directly translates to ""More comfortable and less crowded in MetroPlus...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti coach ket adda iti sango ti tren** - While true (the passage says MetroPlus cars are at the front of the train), this isn't a *benefit* of First Class, it's just a location detail.
* **C: Nalaklaka ngem ti Third Class a tiket** - The passage says it's more affordable than a normal European metro ticket, but doesn't compare it directly to the Third Class (Metro) ticket.
* **D: Agpada ti presiona iti tiket iti Metro** - The passage implies MetroPlus is *different* in price, it doesn’t state they are the same.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti addaan ti tunggal aglug-lugan iti tren iti Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti First ken Third class a coach** (First and Third class coaches).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kada tren ket adda MetroPlus ken Metro a lugan"" (Every train has MetroPlus and Metro compartments).
* **It also clarifies:** MetroPlus is like First Class (""Primera Klase"") and Metro is like Third Class (""Maikatlo a Klase"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awan unay tattao a coach ti Metro** - This isn't directly stated and isn't the main point of the text.
* **B: Agpada ti presio ti tiket para ti dua a class** - The text implies the prices *aren't* the same, as MetroPlus is more comfortable.
* **C: Tallo nga agduduma a class** - The text only mentions two classes.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga aramiden ti peste nga animal?,"The correct answer is **D: Mangigapu kadagiti napigsa a pannakadunor** (Cause severe injuries).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dagiti makaakar a sakit, wenno napeggad nga ayup a mabalin a makadadangran wenno makapatay ti tao gapu iti puersa, ket saan a mabalin nga awagan a peste."" (Serious illnesses, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people due to force, are not considered pests.)

The passage defines pests as things that cause irritation, allergies, or infection, but *not* direct, forceful injury.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mangigapu ti gatel-gatel (Cause itching):** The passage states pests can cause irritation.
* **B: Mangirita kadagiti allergy (Cause allergies):** The passage states pests can cause allergies.
* **C: Mangiwaras ti impeksion (Spread infection):** The passage states pests can spread infection.



"
Sadinno a mabalin a magatang dagiti kard ti prepaid a telepono?,"The correct answer is **C: Kadagiti tiendaan iti igid** (In convenience stores).

Here's why:

The passage states that prepaid phone cards are *available* (implied when discussing their use). While not explicitly stated *where* they are available, convenience stores are the most common place to find them. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Kadagiti partikular a pagilian** (In specific countries) - This is too broad. The passage doesn't discuss where they are sold geographically.
*   **B: Kadagiti istasion ti tren** (In train stations) - While *possible*, it's not a common or primary location.
*   **D: Kadagiti pay phone** (In pay phones) - Pay phones are where you *use* the cards, not where you *buy* them.



"
Kasano a maakses dagiti maymayat a rate ti tawag nga idiaya ti sumagmamano a kard?,"The correct answer is **A: Maaksesda laeng kadagiti paritkular a pagilian** (They are only accessible in particular countries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""dadduma kadagitoy [kard] ket mangipapaay ti adadda a nalaklaka a balor ti panagtawag kadagiti espesipiko a pagilian"" (some of them provide a more favorable rate of call to specific countries). This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Babaen kadagiti libre ti tollna a numero** (Through toll-free numbers) - While toll-free numbers are used to *access* the service, they don't determine the rate.
*   **C: Iti tiendaan iti igid** (In convenience stores) - The passage doesn't mention where you buy the cards impacting the rate.
*   **D: Babaen ti panagusar ti pay phone ken panagbayad ti kanayonan a masingir** (By using a pay phone and paying a fixed amount) - This isn't related to the special rates offered by some cards.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a kaykayo ti saan unay a kadawyan iti Plitvice Lakes national park?","The correct answer is **B: Oak**.

Here's why:

The passage states the park is characterized by beech, spruce, and fir trees. It *doesn't* mention oak trees. Therefore, oak is the least common of the options listed.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti narasay nga ayup a mabirukan iti nasional a parke ti Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage specifically states: ""Dagiti narasay nga ayup a kas kadagiti maradaga nga oso ti Europeo, lobo, agila, puwek, lynx, barang a pusa ken **capercaillie** ket makita sadiay...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pabo (Turkey)** - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Honey Badger** - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Cassowary** - Not mentioned in the passage and is native to Australia and New Guinea, not Europe.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti maitulong ti code iti rehion?","The correct answer is **B: Panagkontrol ti merkado** (Market control).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ti kangrunaan a kaipapananna ket ti panangted kadagiti kumpania ti ad-adu a kontrol ti merkadoda; maipapan amin daytoy iti panangpaikot ti kwarta."" (its main purpose is to give companies more market control; it's all about circulating money.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagkopia ti disk** (Disk copying) - The passage says region codes *don't* prevent disk copying.
*   **C: Pananglapped ti panagpirata** (Stopping piracy) - The passage argues region codes are *ineffective* at stopping piracy.
*   **D: Saan a legal a panagkopia** (Illegal copying) - While piracy is illegal, region codes don't directly address *illegal* copying, but rather control distribution.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan nga agpaypayso maipapan kadagiti code ti rehion nga itultuloy dagiti kompania ti pagiwarnak?","The correct answer is **B: Makatulongda a maliklikan ti saan a legal a panagkopia**.

Here's why:

The passage *directly states* that region codes have no effect on illegal copying: ""dagiti code ti rehion ket awan ti epektona kadagiti ilegal a panagkopia.""  It goes on to explain that bit-for-bit copying bypasses region locks.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Napategda para ti pannakagun-of ti ad-adu a kontrol iti merkado** - The passage states, ""ti kangrunaan a kaipapananna ket ti panangted kadagiti kumpania ti ad-adu a kontrol ti merkadoda.""
*   **C: Makatulongda iti panagikot ti kuarta** - The passage explicitly says, ""maipapan amin daytoy iti panangpaikot ti kwarta.""
*   **D: Manmanoda a makatulong tapno malappedan ti panagpirata** - The passage states companies *claim* it's to ""malapped ti panagpirata"", but then immediately *disproves* this claim.



"
"No sumangpet iti pagtataengam a pagilian, ania a proseso ti kadawyan a saan a sinsinan?","The correct answer is **A: Dagiti panangkita ti imigrasion** (Immigration inspections).

**Here's why:**

The passage (P) directly discusses immigration inspections (""Nupay ti panagkita ti imigrasion..."") and how they can be thorough.  The question (Q) asks about the typical process *when you arrive* in a new country that isn't quick. Immigration inspections are the standard process upon arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panangiwaragawag kadagiti banbanag** (Declaring belongings) - While important for customs, it's *part* of the arrival process, not the overall process itself.
* **C: Dagiti legal a limitasion dagiti banbanag** (Legal limitations of belongings) - This relates to *what* you can bring, not the arrival *process*.
* **D: Dagiti kontrol ti customs** (Customs controls) - The passage mentions customs controls being potentially difficult, but frames it *after* the immigration inspection.  It's a separate step.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulam a maamuan sakbay ti panagawid iti pagiliam?,"The correct answers are **B, C, and D**. Here's why:

* **B: No kasapulan nga ibagam ti aniaman a nalabes iti legal a keddeng** - The passage explicitly states ""ibagam ti aniaman a nalabes iti legal a keddeng."" (declare anything exceeding the legal limit).
* **C: No addanto kontrol ti customs** - The passage mentions that customs control ""ket mabalin a narigat"" (can be strict).
* **D: No adda ti aniaman a banbanag nga itugotmo a madi mabalin** - The passage says to ""amomm dagiti mabalin ken madi mabalin nga itugot"" (know what is allowed and not allowed).

* **A: No addanto ti checkpoint ti imigrasion** - While implied, the passage focuses on *what to do* at immigration/customs, not simply that there *is* a checkpoint.  It's a given when traveling internationally.



Therefore, the best answer is a combination of B, C, and D.  Since you can only choose one, **D** is the most comprehensive as knowing what you *can't* bring covers a significant part of the advice given in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti kaadu ti ania a banag ti mangpalubos kadagiti umuli nga agtul-tuloy a makasukisok kadagiti baro a ruta iti uneg ti Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **D: Dagiti diding** (The walls).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nga agar-aramid kadagiti kabarbaro a pagnaan kadagiti **awan ungtona a mabalin a pagdalanan a didingna**."" This translates to ""...creating new routes in areas with **untapped climbing walls**."" 

The passage explicitly mentions that the walls (diding) provide the opportunity for climbers to explore new routes. The other options are elements *of* the valley, but not what allows for the creation of new climbing paths.



"
"Segun iti impormasion a naipaay iti mabasa, siasino ti mangsakup kadagiti kaaduan a panagballasiw iti Southern Hemisphere?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngem, ti Star Alliance ket abbonganna amin puera iti makindaya nga abagatan a Pasipiko aggapu iti Santiago de Chile agingga iti Tahiti...""  This means Star Alliance covers the most routes in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding a specific area in the South Pacific.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: SkyTeam:** The passage explicitly states SkyTeam *doesn't* have routes across all three Southern Hemisphere oceans.
* **C: South Pacific:** The South Pacific is a *region*, not an airline alliance.
* **D: LATAM Oneworld:** While mentioned, it's only described in relation to a specific flight and not as having the broadest coverage.



"
Ania nga alyansa ti airline ti mangsakup ti kabassitan a kaadu ti panagballasiw ti taaw iti Southern Hemisphere?,"The correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Awan ti aliansa ti linya ti eroplano a dumaldalan iti amin a tallo a baybay iti abagatan a Hemisphere (ken ti SkyTeam ket awan ti dalananna kadagitoy).""  This means SkyTeam has the fewest routes crossing the oceans in the Southern Hemisphere – they don't cover all three ocean regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Star Alliance:** The passage says Star Alliance covers most routes, *except* for a specific area.
*   **B: South Pacific:** This isn't an airline alliance.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld:** While mentioned as a possible flight option, it doesn't represent the alliance with the least coverage.



"
Ania nga organisasion ti tour ti nangsukat ti Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti nagtawid ti Global Running Tours, pagsilpuen ti **Go Running Tours** ti dose-dosena a mangmangted ti sightrunning iti uppat a kontinente."" This directly indicates that Go Running Tours is the organization that created/built/scaled Global Running Tours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Running Copenhagen** - While mentioned as a tour operator *within* the Global Running Tours network, it didn't create it.
*   **C: Running Tours Prague** - Same as Running Copenhagen.
*   **D: Running Tours Barcelona** - Same as Running Copenhagen.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti Go Running Tours ket makatulong a mangikonektar ti mano nga agduduma a sightrunning nga organisasion?","The correct answer is **C: Dose-dosena**.

The text states: ""Ti nagtawid ti Global Running Tours, pagsilpuen ti Go Running Tours ti **dose-dosena** a mangmangted ti sightrunning iti uppat a kontinente."" 

This directly answers the question.
"
Ania ti masapul nga aramiden ti turistano namnamaenda ti kalawagan a mabalin a pannakakita ti maysa a cheetah?,"The correct answer is **C: Mangusar kadagiti binocular**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti leon, cheetah, ken leopardo no maminsan ket managbabain ket nasaysayaat ti pannakakita kadakuada no agusar iti largabista."" (Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes hide and are better seen when using binoculars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapan iti hiking safari:** While a hiking safari gets you closer to nature, the text doesn't specifically say it's best for cheetah sightings.
*   **B: Mapan iti bush walk:** Same as above, good for general wildlife viewing but not specifically cheetahs.
*   **D: Aglugan ken usaren ti kadawyan nga alikamen:** The passage says standard vehicles allow for good viewing of elephants and giraffes, but cheetahs are more elusive and harder to spot without assistance.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti ay-ayup ti nalabit a makita ti bisita bayat ti safari excursion iti maysa a lugan?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti giraffe**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...kas koma ti elepante ken **giraffe**, ket mabalin nga umasideg kadagiti luglugan..."" (like elephants and giraffes, can come close to the roads). 

While the passage *also* mentions lions, leopards, and cheetahs, it says they are sometimes difficult to see and require binoculars. Giraffes are explicitly mentioned as being potentially visible *from* the roads.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mangpababa iti gastos iti panag-tour?","The correct answer is **B: Panagbirok ti grupo ti uppat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...no maymaysaka wenno maysa laeng ti kaduam, padasem ti makiam-ammo iti dadduma pay a tattao ken mangbukelkayo iti grupo nga uppat agingga iti innem ti miembrona tapno nalaklaka ti bayadan ti tunggal maysa."" 

This directly translates to: ""If you are alone or with only one other person, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six members to make the payment cheaper for everyone.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panagapan nga agmaymaysa** - The passage *suggests* avoiding traveling alone *because* it's more expensive.
*   **C: Panagapan kadua ti maysa pay a tao** - This is a starting point, but the passage suggests continuing to build the group to 4-6.
*   **D: Panagbirok ti grupo ti innem wenno ad-adu pay** - While groups of 6+ are also cheaper, the passage specifically highlights building a group *to* 4-6 as the initial goal.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti nalabit nga ipangrunada ti makaala ti kasayaatan a rate ti panag-tour?","The correct answer is **C: Dua nga aggayyem nga agbi-biahe nga agkadua**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tour prices are cheaper with larger groups. It then *suggests* finding others to form a group of four to six to lower the individual cost. However, it *also* warns that tours might be deliberately underfilled to pressure people into paying more. 

Therefore, the people who benefit most from finding ways to get a better rate are **pairs of travelers** who are willing to connect with others to reach that optimal group size (4-6). They actively seek to leverage the cheaper group rate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti turista a mayat nga ag-shuffle car** - This isn't mentioned in the text, and ""shuffle car"" doesn't relate to group rates.
*   **B: Maysa a grupo ti tallo** - A group of three is too small to get the optimal discount (4-6).
*   **D: Maysa a grupo ti lima** - While a group of five *would* get a good rate, the passage focuses on the *process* of *forming* a group to reach that size, implying it's more relevant to those starting smaller.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti nangipaay ti sangalubongan a pannakabigbig iti San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Ti masansan a kaadda dagiti porma ti artes ken pagiwarnak** (The constant presence of forms of art and expression).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nakatulong ti kanayon a pannakailadawanna kadagiti musika, pelikula, literatura ken nalatak a kultura tapno mabigbig ti siudad ken dagiti pagpasiaranna a nalatak iti sibubukel a lubong."" This directly translates to: ""The city's constant association with music, film, literature and popular culture helped to make the city and its attractions famous throughout the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti kapipintasan a pasilidad ti convention** (The convenience of convention facilities) - While mentioned, it's not the primary reason for global recognition.
*   **C: Ti ekonomiko a dibersidad** (Economic diversity) - This is a characteristic of San Francisco, but doesn't directly explain its global fame.
*   **D: Ti rumrumsua a kasaaad ti Asiano a makan** (The abundance of Asian food) - This is a positive attribute, but not the main driver of its international reputation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti San Francisco ti saan nga agppaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Ti intero nga ekonomia ket agdepdepende iti turismo** (The entire economy depends on tourism).

Here's why:

The passage states the San Francisco economy is *diversified* with major sectors like professional services, government, finance, and business *in addition to* tourism. It doesn't say tourism is the *sole* or even primary driver of the entire economy.  

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **A: Masansan a naiparang dayta kadagiti pelikula ken libro** (It is often featured in movies and books) - The passage explicitly mentions San Francisco's contribution to music, film, literature, and popular culture.
* **B: Ti Asiano nga istilo ti panagluto ket popular** (Asian-style cooking is popular) - The passage specifically states San Francisco is one of the best places in the nation for Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese cuisine.
* **C: Adu dagiti hotel ken sentro ti convention** (There are many hotels and convention centers) - The passage mentions a large tourist infrastructure including many hotels and high-class convention facilities.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti biahero ti saan unay a makabenepisio ti panagusar kadagiti serbisio ti ahente iti panagbiahe?","The correct answer is **B: Maysa a nabulanos a biahero (A frugal traveler)**.

Here's why:

The passage states travel agents often have pre-negotiated rates with hotels *but* can also book alternative accommodations like campsites. It also details how agents provide packages including transport and other services.  This suggests agents bundle convenience and potentially some savings, but their services come with a cost.

A frugal traveler who prioritizes finding the *absolute lowest price* would likely be better off booking directly and doing the research themselves to avoid the agent's fees. The passage doesn't suggest the other options are negatively impacted by using an agent:

*   **A: Maysa a saan a makadesision a biahero (An indecisive traveler):** Agents can help with choices and provide recommendations.
*   **C: Maysa a biahero a saan pay a nakaseguro ti visana (A traveler who hasn't secured a visa):**  Agents can *help* with documentation like visas.
*   **D: Maysa a biahero a mangipangruna ti ag-book kadagiti package deal (A traveler who prioritizes booking package deals):** Agents *specialize* in package deals.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas benepisio ti panag-book babaen ti ahente ti panagbiahe?,"The correct answer is **C: Mairaman iti amin a package**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states agents *can* offer packages including flights, transportation, and hotels.** It doesn't say *all* packages include these things. They can also book other accommodations like campsites.
* **A: Dagiti napapartak a dokumento ti panagbiahe (Obtaining travel documents)** - The passage explicitly mentions agents can help with documents like visas.
* **B: Dagiti deal iti hotel (Hotel deals)** - The passage says agents often have relationships with hotels.
* **D: Panangitantan ti panagreserba (Reserving adjustments)** - The passage states agents can change reservations if needed.

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned as a benefit is that all packages include everything.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania dagiti saan a kabaelan ti aplikasion para ti real-time text translator?","The correct answer is **D: Ipatarus a kusto iti 100% ti tunggal kanito.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dakkel ti nagbalbaliwanna, ken masansan ita a mangted ti medio husto a panagipatarus (ken adu met sagpaminsan ti balibad), kasapulan latta ti panagannad agsipud ta posible nga agkamali.""  This means the translation machines are not always accurate and errors are possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ipatarus dagiti pagilasinan iti ganggannaet a pagsasao** - The passage *states* they *can* translate signs into different languages.
*   **B: Ipatarus ti intero a sasao ti teksto** - The passage implies they can translate texts, which encompasses an entire sentence or passage.
*   **C: Ipatarus ti teksto kadagiti banbanag babaen ti smartphone** - The passage *states* they can translate objects in the real world using a smartphone's camera.



"
Ania ti mangpalubos kadagiti pannakaipatarus a maaramid offline?,"The correct answer is **C: Panag-download ti datos ti lengguahe** (Downloading language data).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ti Google Translate, a mabalin a mausar a pagipatarus uray awan ti Internet **no la ket naidownloaden ti kasapulan a lengguahe**."" ( ""...Google Translate, which can be used for translation even without the Internet **if the required language has been downloaded**."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti napasayaat nga engine ti pannakaiparatus** (Improved translation engines) - While good engines are *needed* for translation, they don't enable offline use on their own.
*   **B: Dagiti smartphone** (Smartphones) - Smartphones are the *device* used, but don't enable offline translation.
*   **D: Dagiti aplikasion iti agpaypayso iti oras a kategoria ti pannakaipatarus** (Apps in the real-time translation category) - This is a general description of the apps, not what allows for offline translation.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a trigger para ti avalanches?,"The correct answer is **A: Napigket a niebe** (Compact snow).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states several triggers for avalanches:

*   **Init** (heat) – can melt the snow.
*   **Tattao** (people) – human activity can trigger avalanches.
*   **Kanayonan a panagtinnag ti niebe** (Additional snowfall) – adds weight and instability.

The passage *describes* the need for snow to be unstable and for a trigger to *release* it. Compact snow is the *opposite* of unstable. It's more likely to be stable and resist avalanches.

Therefore, compact snow is not a trigger for avalanches."
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti agbaba kas avalanches?","The correct answer is **C: Surok a kaadu ti niebe kadagiti narangkis a bakras**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ket agdarusdos ti sobra a kaaduna a kas avalanche."" (and slides the excess as an avalanche). This directly links a large accumulation of snow to avalanches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Napigket a niebe a saan a na-trigger (Compacted snow that isn't triggered):** The passage emphasizes the *amount* of snow, not its compaction.  An avalanche needs snow to *move*.
* **B: Narangkis a bakras nga awanan ti niebe (Steep slopes without snow):**  You need snow for an avalanche!
* **D: Niebe a saan a nagaraw dagiti tattao (Snow that people haven't disturbed):** The passage mentions human triggers, but also natural ones. The key is the *amount* of snow, not who or what disturbs it.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti curry ket base ti ania a lalaok?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti herb ken spices**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti curry ket maysa a lutona a nakabatay **iti dadduma a yerba ken rekado**..."" (Curry is a dish based **on various herbs and spices**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yogurt ken danum** - While yogurt and water *can* be used in curry, they aren't the *base* of it.
*   **C: Gatas ti inyog ken karne** - Coconut milk and meat are ingredients sometimes used, but not the base.
*   **D: Dagiti nateng ken gatas** - Vegetables and milk are also ingredients, not the foundation of the dish.



"
"Kadagiti partikular a rehion, ti gatas ti inyog ket no maminsan maus-usar a kasukat ti ania a laok iti curry?","The correct answer is **B: Nateng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...iti Umabagatan nga India ken sumagmamano a rehion iti igid ti baybay ti subkontinente, getta ti niog ti gagangay a masansan a mausar."" This translates to ""...in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.""  The passage doesn't mention coconut milk being used *with* meat (karne), spices (rekado), or yogurt. It's used in curries *instead of* a liquid, which could be used with vegetables (nateng).



"
Apay a kasapulan ti swerve iti lawlaw ti Transantarctic Mountains tapno makapan iti plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti naisingsingayan a traktor ket saan a nataragsit** (The specialized tractor is not agile).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mabalin laeng a maturong iti naisangsangayan a traktora..."" (It can only be traversed by a specialized tractor...) and ""...saan unay a napartak dagitoy isu a masapul ti atiddog a panagsikko ti dalan a manglawlaw kadagiti Kabambantayan a Transantarctic tapno makadanon iti plateau."" (They aren't very maneuverable so a long winding route through the Transantarctic Mountains is needed to reach the plateau).  This clearly indicates the tractor's limited agility is the reason for the winding route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti McMurdo Station ket masansan a nakaserra** (McMurdo Station is often closed) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the station being closed, and even if it were, that wouldn't explain *why* the route is winding.
* **B: Ti compacted a niebe ket delikado** (The compacted snow is dangerous) - While the passage mentions compacted snow, it doesn’t state it’s dangerous, just that the route is marked because of it.
* **D: Nalaklaka daytoy ngem ti panagbiahe iti Ross Sea** (It's shorter than traveling on the Ross Sea) - The passage doesn’t compare the length of the routes, only describes the traverse.



"
"Iti South Pole Traverse, ania ti namarkaan kadagiti bandera?","The correct answer is **C: Dagiti crevass a napno iti niebe** (The snow-filled crevasses).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ti nasedsed a niebena nga adda iti yuyengna a napnuan uneg ken namarkaan ti bandera."" This directly translates to ""...the settled snow in its wake is filled in and marked with flags."" The flags mark the dangerous, hidden crevasses (deep cracks in the ice) that are filled with snow, making them difficult to see.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti trail iti McMurdo Station** (The trail to McMurdo Station) - The passage states the traverse *starts* at McMurdo Station, but the flags mark dangers *along* the route, not the route itself.
*   **B: Dagiti tractor nga agha-haul ti gaas** (The tractors hauling fuel) - Tractors are used *on* the traverse, but they aren't what the flags mark.
*   **D: Dagiti delikado a swerve iti lawlaw dagiti bantay** (The dangerous curves in the mountain passes) - While the route goes through mountains, the passage specifically mentions marking the crevasses.



"
Ania ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas maysa a banag a kasapulan nga annadan dagiti turista no mapanda iti Southern Africa?,"The correct answer is **C: Dandani amin dagiti pagilian a karruba ti Southern Africa ket natalged.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bayat nga agplanplanoka nga uray no ti Makinbagatan nga Africa ket natalged, dagiti kaarrubana a pagilian ket saan."" (While planning that Southern Africa is hot, its neighboring countries are not.) This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Dagiti agduduma a nasion ket addaan kadagiti agduduma a kasapulan para kadagiti Visa** - This is stated in the text: ""Dagiti kasapulan para iti Visa ken iti bayadna ket agsabali depende iti nasion..."" (Visa requirements and fees vary depending on the country...)
* **B: Ti panagsukisok babaen ti lugan ket nasayaat a pamay-an tapno agpasiar kadagiti lugar iti ruar ti nadadael a dalan** - The text supports this: ""Nasayaat a wagas ti iseserrek iti Umabagatan nga Africa babaen ti kotse tapno makita amin a kinapintas ti rehion ken tapno makadanon kadagiti lugar nga awan kadagiti normal a ruta dagiti turista."" (A good way to explore Southern Africa is by car to see all the beauty of the region and reach places without normal tourist routes.)
* **D: Ti 4x4 ket maikalikagum no agbiahe ka babaen ti lugan** - The text says: ""...iti 4x4 ket natagipateg a pamalbalakad ken iti adu a lugar ket madanon laeng iti nangato a base iti pilid a 4x4."" (A 4x4 is a valuable plan and in many places can only be reached with a high ground clearance 4x4.)



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti maikonsiderar a madi a balakad para kadagiti turista a mangsukisok ti Southern Africa babaen ti lugan?","The correct answer is **C: Ti panagbiahe babaen ti lugan ket nasayaat para kadagiti agsapsapul a sumiasi dagiti normal a ruta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nasayaat a wagas ti iseserrek iti Umabagatan nga Africa babaen ti kotse tapno makita amin a kinapintas ti rehion ken tapno makadanon kadagiti lugar nga awan kadagiti normal a ruta dagiti turista."" This directly supports the idea that overland travel is good for exploring beyond typical tourist routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti banbanag a partikular para ti emerhensia iti uneg ti lugan ket kasapulan ti kalintegan** - While the passage mentions emergency regulations vary by country, it doesn't say they *require vigilance* specifically. It just highlights the need to be aware of them.
* **B: Uray no maikalikagum ti 4x4, adu kadagiti lugar ket maakses babaen kadagiti normal a lugan** - The passage actually suggests the *opposite* - that many places are only accessible with a high-clearance 4x4.
* **D: Saan amin a pagilian a karruba iti Southern Africa ket mayat a bisitaen** - The passage only states that neighboring countries aren't all as stable as South Africa, not that they aren't worth visiting.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas mabalin a delikado iti panangibati kadagiti bagmo nga awan ti agbantay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mabalinda a matikaw no kaniada daytoy**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Target dagiti agtatakaw dagiti bag a di maaywanan"" (Thieves target unattended bags). This means bags *can* be stolen. However, the passage doesn't explicitly say they *will* be stolen if you have them. It only highlights that they are a target.
* **A: Mabalinda a matakaw** - This is stated directly in the text.
* **B: Mabalin nga agbalin ka a carrier ti droga a saanmo nga ammo** - The text clearly states you could unknowingly carry drugs (""Mabalin a dimo mapupuotan a maus-usarka gayamen nga agipuspuslit iti droga"").
* **D: Dagiti autoridad ket makunada a mabalin a bomb threat daytoy** - The text mentions bags are used to avoid attention from authorities investigating bombings (""pakaawisan ti imatang dagiti autoridad nga agan-annad kadagiti pangta ti panagbomba"").

Therefore, option C is the only one *not* directly supported by the text as a definite danger.



"
Ania ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa maipapan ti panagitugot ti droga?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti sumagmamano a pagilian, dagiti damo a nangaramid kadaytoy ket mabalin a masentensiaan ti pannakatay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ti dadduma a pagilian ket addaan ti nakaro a draconian a dusa uray para kadagiti immuna a basol; dagitoy ket pakairamanan iti pannakapapatay."" (Some countries have extremely draconian punishments even for first offenses; these include the death penalty.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti ad-adu a panagannad ti masapul nga aramiden no agbi-biahe iti sabali a pagilian.** - While implied (being careful is important), the passage doesn't *explicitly* state you need to do *more* searching. It just warns of the dangers.
* **C: Dagiti aso a mangang-angot ket mabalin a mausar nga awan ti pammalubos.** - The passage says they can be used *without your knowledge*, not without permission.
* **D: Mabalin a kumpiskaren dagiti autoridad dagiti bagyo, uray no awan ti awityo a droga.** -  The passage focuses on the risk of being *used* to smuggle drugs, not just having your bags searched and confiscated.



"
Ania a tipo ti mainum ti saan a naibaga kas maysa a banag a mabalin a padasem nga aramiden iti pagtaengan bayat ti staycation?,"The correct answer is **C: Serbesa (Beer)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions coffee (""naimas a kape""), chamomile tea (""makapabang-ar a tsaa a chamomile""), smoothies, and suggests visiting bars and pubs for drinks. However, it *doesn't* specifically mention beer as something you'd make *at home* during a staycation. It implies going *out* to a bar for beer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Juice:** While not explicitly detailed, making a smoothie implies being able to make juice as well.
*   **B: Kape (Coffee):** Directly mentioned as a drink to enjoy at home.
*   **D: Tsaa (Tea):** Chamomile tea is specifically mentioned as a drink to make at home.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti kasapulam a bisitaen bayat ti staycation no ti siudadmo ket popular iti kultura ti panaginum?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti pub a saanmo unay a pappanan**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""no agtalinaedka iti siudad nga adda ti nadumaduma a kultura iti panaginum, mapan iti bar ken pub iti kaarrubaan a madim masansan nga aramiden."" This directly suggests exploring pubs you don't normally visit when in a staycation in a city known for its drinking culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dagiti coffee shop iti ruar ti sangakaarrubaam:** While the passage mentions coffee, it's framed as a daily routine, not a staycation activity.
* **B: Dagiti tiendaan ti juice wenno smoothie:** Smoothies are suggested as a remedy for stress, not necessarily a staycation exploration.
* **D: Dagiti panganan a mangserserbi ti chamomile a tsaa:** Chamomile tea is for relaxing at night, again, part of a routine, not a staycation adventure.



"
Sadinno a makita dagiti eskulta a kalapati?,"The correct answer is **B: Iti paraangan ti simbaan** (In the churchyard).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Itiparaangan ti simbaan, adda dagiti makapaawis a kitikit a marmol a kalapati a naiparabaw kadagiti dadduma a tanem."" which directly translates to ""In the churchyard, there are beautiful little marble doves placed on some plants."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gudua ti maysa oras manipud ti ili** - The passage says it takes half an hour to *reach* the town, not where the doves are.
*   **C: Iti isla ti Eysturoy** - Haldarsvik overlooks Eysturoy, but the doves are specifically described as being in the churchyard.
*   **D: Iti uneg ti simbaan** - The passage explicitly places the doves *in the churchyard* (outside the church building).



"
Ania a tipo ti visa ti mabalin a mangikasapulan ti maysa a tao a mangipaay ti pammaneknek ti naan-anay a suporta iti kuarta?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ti estudiante**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...kasapulam ti surat ti awis manipud iti institusion a kayatmo a pagbasaan , ken kasta met ti **pammaneknek ti kaadda ti pondo a mangsuporta iti bagim uray iti laeng umuna a tawen ti kursom**."" This directly links the need to prove financial support to the *student visa* application process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Visa ti negosio (Business Visa):** This visa is for business-related travel, not demonstrating long-term financial support for studies.
*   **B: Visa ti turista (Tourist Visa):** Tourist visas are for short visits and don't require proof of funding for an extended period like a student's course of study.
*   **C: Temporario a visa (Temporary Visa):** While a student visa *is* a type of temporary visa, the passage specifically connects the financial proof to the student visa requirements.



"
Siasino ti ad-adda a mangikasapulan ti extended a visa?,"The correct answer is **C: Maysa nga internasional nga estudiante**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that students needing to stay in a country for an extended period (longer than a tourist or business traveler) *require* a visa. The passage contrasts this with tourists and business travelers who may not need a visa for short visits. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa a regular a turista:** The passage says tourists often *don't* need a visa for short visits.
*   **B: Maysa a seasoned nga agbi-biahe:** Being a frequent traveler doesn't change the visa requirements for length of stay.
*   **D: Maysa nga agbi-biahe gapu ti negosio:** Similar to tourists, business travelers can often enter on short-term visas or visa waivers.



"
Kaano a rumbeng a nangnangruna a sipapanunotka kadagiti lamok?,"The correct answer is **A: Bayat dagiti bulan ti kalgaw**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) explicitly states:** ""No kalgaw, masapul a bantayam dagiti lamok..."" (During the summer, it is necessary to guard against mosquitoes...). This directly links the concern about mosquitoes to the summer months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kadagiti hike (During hikes):** While you might encounter mosquitoes on hikes, the passage doesn't specifically say hikes are when you *primarily* think about them.
* **C: Iti rainforest (In the rainforest):** The passage *mentions* rainforests as a place where mosquitoes are prevalent, but it doesn't say it's when you *start* to think about them.  It's the *season* that prompts the thought.
* **D: Bayat ti panagmaneho (While driving):**  Driving is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti liklikam nga aramiden tapno makalisi kadagiti lamok bayat ti panagmaneho iti rainforest?","The correct answer is **A: Baybay-an a silulukat dagiti ridaw ti lugan iti napaut unay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""masapul a bantayam dagiti lamok...iti mano a segundo a dagiti ruangan ket nakalukat no umunegka iti lugan ket naan-anay a panawen para kadagiti lamok a kaduam nga umuneg iti lugan."" This directly translates to needing to be careful about mosquitoes and that even briefly opening the vehicle doors allows them in.  Therefore, keeping the doors *closed* is the best prevention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Panagmaneho bayat ti kalgaw** - The passage mentions kalgaw (summer) but doesn't suggest avoiding travel during that time. It emphasizes being *prepared* for mosquitoes during any time you're in the forest.
* **C: Panagmaneho kadagiti subtropical a lugar** - The passage mentions subtropical forests but this isn’t about avoiding that climate, it’s about mosquitoes being present in it.
* **D: Panagibati ti lugan nga awan ti mangkita bayat ti panag-hike** - This is irrelevant to the passage, which focuses on travel *in a vehicle*.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti Sundarbans ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **D: Makita dagiti ad-adu a labang nga ugsa ngem kadagiti Bengal a tigre**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...mapattapatta nga adda itan 400 a tigre a Royal Bengal ken agarup 30,000 a labang nga ugsa iti lugar."" (approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 crocodiles in the area). This clearly shows there are *more* crocodiles than tigers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

* **A: Ipakitana ti sumagmamano a napigsa a bakir nga adda pay laeng inggana tatta** - The text says the forests are not lush but include ""some of the last remaining stands of dense forest.""
* **B: Kagudua ti dagup a kalawana ket tininep ti kadandanuman** - The text states that about a third of the area is water, meaning two-thirds is land. This is close to ""kagudua"" (half) so can be considered as the closest correct answer.
* **C: Daytoy ti kadadakkelan a takdang a napno ti parakad iti entero a lubong** - The first sentence directly states this.



"
Ania a paset ti bakir ti adda iti teritorio ti India?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti parte iti bakir nga adda iti uneg ti teritorio ti India ket maawagan a Sundarbans National Park."" (The part of the forest within the territory of India is called Sundarbans National Park.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ti sanktuario dagiti naatap nga animal:** While the Sundarbans *is* a sanctuary, the question asks specifically about the *part* of the forest within India's territory.
* **C: Ti World Heritage Site:** This describes the whole Sundarbans area, not just the Indian portion.
* **D: Ti Gangetic plain:** The passage states the forest *used to be* covered by the Gangetic plain, but is not the current part within India.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, siasino ti ad-adda a limitado ti pannakaawatda ti Ingles lengguahe a Ingles?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti tattao a naub-ubing (The young people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo."" This directly translates to ""It is often expected that knowledge is limited to the basics for those who are growing up.""  This refers to young people/children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti tattao nga agasasao ti kababaan ti dua a sabali pay a lengguahe (People who speak less than two other languages)** - The passage doesn't focus on people who speak *other* languages, but specifically on English proficiency.
* **C: Dagiti tattao nga agbi-biahe iti Toronto (People traveling to Toronto)** - The passage uses Toronto as a scenario, but doesn't say travelers have limited English.
* **D: Dagiti tattao a natataengan (Residents)** - The passage doesn't generally state that residents have limited English. It focuses on the younger generation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti narigat nga iyebkas?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti adres**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adu nga entero a nasion ket nalaing nga agsao ti Ingles, ket Kanayonanna pay namnamaem a limitado laeng iti pannakaammo-kangrunaanna kadagiti agtutubo. Panunotem, no kayatmo, ti maysa a Mancunian, Bostonian, Jamaican ken Sydneysider nga agtutugaw iti lawlaw ti maysa a lamisaan a mangrabrabiida iti maysa a restaurant idiay Toronto. Maragragsakanda nga agin-innestoria kadagiti mapaspasamak iti nakayanakanda nga ili, nga isasaoda dagita iti bukodda nga ayug ken bengngat.""  This directly points out that addresses are difficult to repeat/understand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dagiti sarita iti agduduma nga accent:** While accents *can* be difficult, the passage doesn't specifically say they are the hardest thing to repeat. It *shows* this through the example, but doesn't state it explicitly.
*   **C: Dagiti naisurat a sarita:** The passage says written words are generally easier to understand.
*   **D: Ti lokal nga argot:** Argot isn't directly mentioned as being particularly difficult to repeat; the focus is on pronunciation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a kasasaad ti kasayaatan para ti agbi-biahe nga agplan-plano a mangusar ti bus manipud ti inter-distrito nga istasion?","The correct answer is **D: Ti agbi-biahe ket mapan iti daya ken sumangpet iti istasion sakbay ti 6:20.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ngem kaaduan, kangrunaan dagiti mapan daya ken Jakar/Bumthang pumanawda iti baetan iti 06:30 ken 07:30."" This means buses to the east (daya) leave between 6:30 and 7:30. To ensure a seat, given the buses are often full, it's best to arrive *before* 6:30. 6:20 is before 6:30.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While it's good to book in advance, the passage doesn't specifically link this to travelers going to Jakar.
* **B:** The passage says buses to Bumthang leave *between* 6:30 and 7:30, not *at* 7.
* **C:** The passage mentions taxis for Paro, not buses, and doesn't mention any time restrictions related to traveling to Paro by bus.



"
Ania ti nasayaat a singasing para iti turista a mangsapsapul nga agbiahe nga agpadaya manipud iti inter-district bus station?,"The correct answer is **B: Gumatang ti advance a tiket**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gapu ta masansan a mapno dagiti agbiahe dagiti bus ditoy distrito, maisingasing ti pananggatang iti tiket a nasapsapa iti sumagmamano nga aldaw."" (Because buses in this district are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets in advance for a few days.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti bus ket pumanaw laeng kalpasan ti 8:30** - This is incorrect. The passage states buses *mostly* depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
* **C: Adu a bus ti pumanpanaw iti intero nga aldaw** - While buses run, the passage implies they can be full, so quantity isn't guaranteed.
* **D: Mabalin a ti shared taxi ti kasisiriban a pamay-an ti panagbiahe** - While taxis are mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically recommend them *instead* of the bus for eastward travel, it just presents them as an alternative for shorter distances.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nakanatad a pannakailadawan ti Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Saan a maakses ti eroplano**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""uray no ti reputasionna ket pakaawisan dagiti turista, ken addaan pay daytoy iti airport."" (even though its reputation attracts tourists, it still has an airport). This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: Ad-adu ti Arabic nga implwensiana ngem ti intero a pagilian** - The passage says ""Ti siudad ket naiduma unay kadagiti dadduma a siudad ti pagilian, gapu ta ad-adu iti sagudayna nga Arabo ngem iti African."" (The city is very different from other cities in the country, because its Arab influence is more than its African influence).
*   **B: Napanglaw daytoy** - The passage states ""napanglaw nga ili ti Timbuktu"" (the desolate city of Timbuktu).
*   **D: Agtalinaed dayta a pakaawisan dagiti usiuso a turista** - The passage says ""ti reputasionna ket pakaawisan dagiti turista"" (its reputation attracts tourists).



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a pudno a banag maipapan ti Timbuktu ti agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Maakses ti siudad babaen ti eroplano**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""ken addaan pay daytoy iti airport."" (and it still has an airport). This directly supports the statement that the city is accessible by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ad-adda nga eksotiko ngem napanglaw** - While the passage says Timbuktu became a metaphor for an exotic place, it also states it's a ""napanglaw nga ili"" (desolate city). This makes the statement contradictory.
*   **C: Basbassit ti African a saguday ngem ti aglawlaw a siudad na** - The passage says Timbuktu has *more* Arab influence than African.
*   **D: Ti siudad ket saanen a makaawis kadagiti turista** - The passage states ""uray no ti reputasionna ket pakaawisan dagiti turista"" (even though its reputation attracts tourists)."
Kaano nga orihinal a naiyiskediul ti Summer Olympics? ,"The correct answer is **D: Hulio 2020**.

The text states: ""...ngem manipud idi Marso kaaduan kadagiti annuroten ti panagkansela a naibasar iti coronavirus ket saan a mailayon agingga iti Hulio 2020, nga isu ti pannaka-schedule ti Olympics."" This directly states the Olympics were originally scheduled for July 2020.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania punto nga agbalin nga ipu-ipo ti imbudo?","The correct answer is **C: Bayat ti panagbaba manipud kadagiti ulep ti bagyo.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mangrugida a kas imbudo a bumabbaba aggapu iti ulep ti bagyo, ken agbalin nga “ipu-ipo” no dumikketda iti daga."" This directly translates to ""They start as a funnel descending from the storm cloud, and become a “tornado” when they touch the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: No madanon ti angin ti nasurok 100 a milya kada oras** - While tornadoes *have* strong winds, the text doesn't say that's *when* it becomes a tornado, but rather a *characteristic* of one.
*   **B: No dagiti teddek ti angin ket agrugi nga agikut-ikot** - The text says it *is* a swirling vortex of air, that is its definition but not when it becomes a tornado.
*   **D: Kalpasan a masagid ti daga** -  The text states it becomes a tornado *when* it touches the ground, not *after*.



"
Ania kadagitoy ti umiso a pakabigbigan ti ipu-ipo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kanayonda a mangaramid ti angin iti nasurok 100-200 a milya kada oras**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Makagun-odda ti napigsa nga angin (masansan a 100-200 milia kada oras)..."" (They can generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour)...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While tornadoes *can* be accompanied by debris, this isn't a defining characteristic. The passage mentions debris as a *result* of the strong winds, not a defining feature.
* **C:** The passage says they *become* a tornado *when* they touch the ground, not that they become an imbudo *after* hitting the ground.
* **D:** The passage describes a tornado as a rotating column of air *with* low pressure, not a tall structure that forces air outwards.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, manipud sadinno a kasapulan a makagun-od ti balakad ti agbibiahe maipapan ti kasasaad ti pulitika ti siudad ti destinasionda?","The correct answer is **D: Manipud ti bukodda a gobierno**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mabalinmo met a konsultaen ti pammagbaga dagiti gobierno a saan laeng a ti bukbukodmo, ngem ket nairanta pammagbagada a para kadagiti umilida.""  This translates to ""You can also consult the statements of governments, not only for yourself, but also for their citizens.""

This clearly indicates you should get travel advisories regarding political situations from *your own* government.  The example given about Americans in the Middle East needing to consider the views of Europeans and Arabs is illustrating the complexities, but the primary source of information is still your government.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manipud ti gobierno ti pagilian a bisitaenda:** The text doesn’t suggest relying on the government of the country you're visiting for warnings about its *own* political instability.
*   **B: Manipud kadagiti makuna a naipresentar iti uneg ti balakad ti panagbiahe:** While travel advisories *contain* this information, the text emphasizes where to *get* the advisories from – the government.
*   **C: Manipud kadagiti umili ti pagilian a bisitaenda:** Relying on locals for an objective assessment of political risk isn’t recommended.



"
"No adda padamag ti panagbiahe, ania ti saan a nalabit a mapasaran ti ganggannaet nga umili?","The correct answer is **A: Naapektaran ti pannakakansela ti insurance** (Affected cancellation of insurance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""No iti pagilian a papanam ket agbalin nga addaan ti padamag ti panagbiahe...ket mabalin a maapektaran."" (If the country you are traveling to becomes subject to a travel advisory...it may be affected).  It specifically mentions travel insurance and cancellation insurance as things that *can* be affected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Napasimple unay dagiti sumario maipapan ti kasasaad ti pulitika ti pagilian** (Summaries about the political situation of the country are too simplified) - This is a general statement about the information presented, not a direct consequence for a traveler.
* **C: Naapektaran ti insurance ti salun-at** (Affected health insurance) - While health insurance *could* be affected, the passage doesn't emphasize it as strongly as cancellation insurance.
* **D: Detalyado nga impormasion maipapan ti kasasaad ti pulitika ti pagilian** (Detailed information about the political situation of the country) - The passage actually says the information is *not* detailed.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti biahe ti saan unay a mangikasapulan ti baddang iti panag-book manipud ti ahente ti panagbiahe?","The correct answer is **A: Panagbiahe iti komperensia ti trabaho iti siudad a sinarungkaran ti biahero idi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents were especially helpful for trips involving complexity – things like language barriers, unfamiliar cultures, or navigating less-developed nations. It also mentions agents being good at tailoring trips to budgets and destinations.

A trip to a familiar city for a work conference would likely *not* require these specialized skills. The traveler is likely already familiar with the city and the trip is straightforward (conference logistics are often handled by the event organizers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maysa a dua a lawas a biahe iti partikular unay a badyet:**  The passage mentions agents being good with budgets.
* **C: Maysa a panagbiahe a mangiparang iti lapped iti pagsasao:** The passage explicitly says agents helped with language barriers.
* **D: Ti umuna a biahe ti biahero iti sabali a pagilian:** This would be a complex trip, benefitting from an agent's expertise.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, iti ania a kasasaad a makabenepisio unay iti agbi-biahe manipud ti tulong ti ahente ti panagbiahe?","The correct answer is **B: No interesado ti agbi-biahe ti panag-book ti excursion ti espesialidad iti umuna a daras.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are good at finding unique travel experiences (""sabasabali a klase ti panagbiahe""), and cater to different budgets and destinations.  Someone interested in a specialized excursion (like a cultural tour, or a specific activity) would benefit from an agent's expertise in finding those options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Booking roundtrip flights is something most people can do themselves easily now. The passage highlights agents being helpful with more complex travel.
* **C:** Knowing the local language would *reduce* the need for an agent, not increase it.
* **D:** Visiting a familiar place doesn't necessarily require an agent's help.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong iti agbibiahe a maliklikan ti saan a kinanapnek bayat ti panagbisita kadagiti baro a lugar?","The correct answer is **D: Panangliklik ti sakbay a panagadal iti pagnaedan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Daytoy ti kasapulan a kanayonmo panunoten tapno maliklikam ti pannakaupay wenno ti panangguram kadagiti lokal a panagaramid ti bambanag."" (This is what you need to always remember to avoid offending or disrespecting local customs.) It then lists examples of things that *differ* from home – customs, laws, food, traffic, etc.  Therefore, researching the destination (pagnaedan) beforehand is key to avoiding misunderstandings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panangnamnama kadagiti agpapada a kadawyan ti naggapuanda** (Expecting customs to be the same as your origin) - The passage directly contradicts this. It says things *won't* be the same.
* **B: Kinatulnog a padasen dagiti makan a saan a nakairuaman** (Boldly trying foods you're unfamiliar with) - While trying new foods is a part of travel, it doesn't necessarily help you avoid offense or disrespect.
* **C: Panagsurot kadagiti agpada a linteg ti naggapuanda** (Following the same laws as your origin) - The passage specifically mentions laws are often different, so this is incorrect and potentially problematic.



"
"Base ti impormasion iti mabasa, ania a tipo ti tao ti mabalin a makapadas ti saan a kinanapnek no agbiahe iti sabali a lugar?","The correct answer is **C: Maysa a tao a naserraan ti panunotna** (A person with a closed mind).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding that customs, laws, and ways of life *will* be different when traveling.  Someone who is ""naserraan ti panunotna"" (closed-minded) would be unwilling or unable to accept these differences, leading to awkward situations or offense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maysa a tao a kaykayatna dagiti eksotiko a makan** (A person who likes exotic foods) -  Enjoying new food is a positive aspect of travel and shows openness.
* **B: Maysa a tao nga ipangpangrunana ti panagbaliw** (A person who prioritizes change) - This suggests adaptability, the *opposite* of getting into trouble.
* **D: Maysa a tao a mangipapas ti panagadal ti baro a banbanag** (A person who insists on learning new things) - This is a good trait for a traveler, demonstrating respect and a desire to understand.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalikagum a balakad para kadagiti agbi-biahe no damo kayo a bumis-bisita ti rumangrang-ay pay laeng a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **B: Liklikan ti panaggasto iti makan bayat ti sumagmamano nga umuna nga aldaw mo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""pagpanunotam ti panaggasto iti hotel nga adda Western nga istilona ken dekalidad, makan, ken dagiti serbisio tapno makatulong tapno maruamka."" This means *spending* on good quality food and services (including hotels) is recommended, not *avoiding* it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Ammuen ti lokal a fauna sakbay a maturog iti daga:** The passage directly advises against sleeping on the ground without knowing the local fauna (""saanmo ammo ti lokal a fauna"").
*   **C: Ti indayon ket maikalikagum no agkampo iti ruar:** The passage suggests using a tent or shelter when camping to avoid insects and scorpions (""agitugotka ti bassit a balay a pagkampingan wenno indayon tapno maiyadayo dagiti uleg, scorpions"").
*   **D: Mapan iti dekalidad a hotel no damo ka a sumangpet:** The passage recommends staying in a quality, Western-style hotel upon arrival (""panunotem ti posibilidad a maikawaka iti kulturada...pagpanunotam ti panaggasto iti hotel nga adda Western nga istilona ken dekalidad"").



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a nadakamat kas banag a paggastuan tapno maruamka iti rumangrang-ay pay laeng a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti matres wenno ap-ap para ti panagkampo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically advises *against* sleeping on a mattress or on the ground when camping in unfamiliar areas due to unknown local wildlife. It suggests a small cabin or tent instead.  The other options (Western-style food, quality services, quality hotels) are all *recommended* for comfort and safety when traveling to a developing country.



"
"Ania kadagiti sumaganad a pagpilian ti kasayaatan para ti para-iggem ti polisia a kayat a mangaramid ti virtual a kopia ti polisiada, ngem awanan ti akses iti internet?","The correct answer is **C: Panagidulin ti kopia a naidulin iti memoria ti laptopda (Saving a copy to the laptop's memory)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt specifically states:** ""No agbiaheka nga adda ti laptop or tablet, agipanka ti kopiana iti memoryna wenno iti disc (mausarmo uray awan ti internet)."" - This directly addresses the scenario of needing a virtual copy *without* internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panangited ti kopia iti kaduam iti biahe (Giving a copy to a travel companion):** While helpful, this doesn't create a *virtual* copy for the person's own use when internet is unavailable.
* **B: Panag-email ti kopia iti bagbagida (Emailing a copy to their email):** Requires internet access, which the scenario specifies is not available.
* **D: Panagidulin ti kopia iti “cloud” (Saving a copy to the ""cloud""):**  Also requires internet access.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a kasapulan a maipakita iti polisia?","The correct answer is **D: Ti email address ti para-iggem ti polisia**.

Here's why:

The text states the police need a copy of the insurance and your contact details *including* email address and international phone number for claims/authorization and receipts. It *doesn't* mention needing the police officer's email address.  The text focuses on providing *your* information *to* the insurer and the police, not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti internasional a numero ti telepono para ti panagaramid ti panagdawat** - The text explicitly says to provide this.
* **B: Ti email address ti umawat ti seguro** - The text explicitly says to provide this.
* **C: Dagiti internasional a numero ti telepono para kadagiti panag-autorisa** - The text explicitly says to provide this.

"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti negatibo a kadakkel ti manganninaw ti pormat ti film a kadawyan unay a maus-usar?","The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm a negatibo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ti kaaduanna a naus-usar ket ti gagangay a film a 35mm (36 by 24 mm a negative)."" This directly identifies the 36 x 24 mm negative as the most commonly used format.

While the passage *also* mentions 6x6 cm and 56x56 mm formats, it explicitly says the 35mm format (36x24 mm) is the *most* common.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a pormat ti film ti maipada ti resolusion a kas iti DSLR?,"The correct answer is **D: 6 x 6 cm film**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the 6x6 cm format (56x56mm negative) provides a significantly larger negative area than 35mm film – nearly four times larger.  Larger negative area equates to more detail captured, and thus a resolution *more* comparable to a modern DSLR.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 35 mm film:** The passage states this is the *most common* but doesn't imply it has DSLR-level resolution.
* **B: Dagiti dadduma a kalalainganna ti pormana a film:** This is too vague. The specific size matters.
* **C: 56 x 56 mm film:** While larger than 35mm, the passage clarifies that it's the 6x6 *cm* format that's a significant leap in area.

Here's why:

The passage states that *after* you've learned formatting and editing on an established website, *then* you can create your own website. This indicates creating your own website is the final step described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sanayen ti panag-format iti web:** This is an *early* step, not the final one.
*   **B: Agsurat kadagiti adu nga artikulo para ti mayat ti reputasionna a blog ti panagbiahe:** This is part of the learning process *before* creating your own site.
*   **D: Pasayaatem ti paglaingam nga ag-edit:**  This is a skill to be developed, not the final goal.

The passage (P) specifically states that to avoid losing money in a travel writing business, you should **first** practice formatting and editing *on an established website*. This implies that web formatting is the foundational skill needed *before* even considering creating your own website. 

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Panag-blog (Blogging):** While important, the passage prioritizes technical skills first. You need to *present* your writing effectively.
* **C: Panag-edit (Editing):** Also crucial, but follows formatting – you format *then* edit within that format.
* **D: Panagaramid ti website (Website creation):** The passage explicitly says this comes *after* mastering formatting and editing on an existing platform.



"
Iti ania a tipo ti klima ti kadawyan a pakakitaan dagiti problema iti bagis?,"The correct answer is **C: Napudot a klima**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maipapan kadagiti sakit iti panaganges no madama ti nalamiis a klima, dagiti problema iti bagis idiay addaan napudot a klima ket gagangayen ken ti adu a kaso makapasuron ngem saan met a delikado.""  This directly translates to: ""Regarding illnesses due to changes in climate, problems with the stomach in hot climates are common and many cases are serious but not dangerous.""

Therefore, the passage specifically identifies hot climates as where stomach problems are frequently found.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ti kanayon a pannakaisarang ket mabalin a makaigapu ti imyunidad iti ania?","The correct answer is **B: Dagiti lokal a mikrobio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: Iti balayda, gapu iti kanayon a panakaisarang ti **lokal a mikrobio**, nangato ti tiansa nga immunekan.""  This directly translates to ""In their home, due to constant exposure to **local microbes**, the chance of immunity increases."" 

The passage explains that frequent exposure to local microbes builds immunity. The other options are *results* of not having that immunity, or specific illnesses mentioned as examples, not what the constant exposure *leads to*.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti bentahe iti panagbiahe iti uneg ti lugar ti Schengen?,"The correct answer is **E: All of the above.**

Here's why:

* **A: Maliklikan ti adu a panagaplikar ti visa** - The passage explicitly states ""saanmo a kasapulanen ti mangala kadagiti visa iti sabsabali a pagilian a miembro ti Schengen.""
* **B: Pakaurnongan ti kuarta** -  Applying for visas costs money, so avoiding multiple visa applications saves money. The passage also mentions this (""pakaurnungam ti oras, kuarta ken papeles"").
* **C: Maliklikan ti adu a checkpoint ti panagkontrol ti passport** - The passage states ""gagangay a makaballasiwka kadagiti beddeng a saankan nga aglasat kadagiti checkpoint a mangkonkontrol iti passport.""
* **D: Awan ti kasapulan iti passport** - While not explicitly stated, the passage implies that crossing borders within the Schengen area is easier *because* you don't constantly need to show your passport.  However, you still *need* a passport, just not constantly checked.

Since all of the options are benefits mentioned in the passage, ""All of the above"" is the most accurate answer.



"
Ania ti saanen a mabirukan iti tanem ni Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti kinabaknang** (The treasures).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dagiti adu a kinabaknang iti ayan ti tanem ket awanen, ngem naiyakar dagitoy iti Egyptian Museum idiay Cairo."" (Many treasures within the tomb are missing, but they were moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sumagmamano a dekorasion** - The passage explicitly states the tomb has ""awan unay ti dekorasionna"" (little decoration).
*   **B: Ulo ti mummy** - The passage states that you can see the ""ulona laeng ken abaga"" (head and shoulders) of the mummy.
*   **C: Dagiti abaga ti mummy** - The passage states that you can see the ""ulona laeng ken abaga"" (head and shoulders) of the mummy.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a destination iti Vancouver ti saan unay a makaguyuguy kadagiti agbi-biahe nga sipapanunot ti presio? ","The correct answer is **C: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Bowen Island is easily accessible by a scheduled water taxi from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.** This implies it's a relatively affordable and convenient option compared to other destinations.
* **Whistler is described as being a 1.5-hour drive from Vancouver and was popular due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.** This suggests it might be more expensive due to its fame and distance.
* **The Sea to Sky corridor is simply the *route* to Whistler, not a destination itself.** It doesn't directly imply affordability.
* **Granville Island is a *departure point* to Bowen Island, not the destination being evaluated for cost.**

The passage frames Bowen Island as an accessible, close-by option, hinting at a more budget-friendly experience.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a destinasion ti nalabit a mangidiaya kadagiti agbi-biahe ti autentiko a kapadasan iti Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen Island**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is a ""lovely destination or excursion"" and describes its attractions (kayaking, hiking, shopping, dining). It's presented as a nearby, easily accessible escape *from* Vancouver, offering an authentic experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Whistler:** The passage mentions Whistler, but frames it as a more distant destination (1.5 hours from Vancouver) and primarily known for skiing.
*   **C: Downtown Vancouver:** The passage mentions Downtown Vancouver *as a point of departure* to Bowen Island (via Granville Island), not as the destination itself.
*   **D: Granville Island:** The passage states Granville Island is where the water taxi departs *from*, not the destination.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kaano a rumbeng a sumarungkar dagiti agbibiahe iti Falls no agsapsapulda kadagiti di malapdan a buya?","The correct answer is **C: No ti kaadu ti danum ket nangato**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""No panagtutudo (Nobiembre agingga Marso), ti kadakkel ti danum ket nangatngato ken ti Busay ket napigpigsa."" and ""sigurado a gapu ta ti kinaadu ti danum ket nangato ti panagbuyam iti aktual a Falls ket malingdan—iti amin a danum!"". This directly links higher water levels (and therefore, the rainy season - Nobiembre to Marso) with getting soaked when viewing the Falls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nobiembre agingga Marso:** While this is *when* the water is high, the question asks *why* you'll get wet.
*   **B: Bayat ti panawen nga adu ti turista:** The number of tourists doesn't directly cause you to get wet.
*   **D: Iti kalpasan ti panawen ti tudo:** The passage focuses on the *during* the rainy season, not after.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti bentahe ti panagbisita ti Victoria Falls iti nagbaetan ti Nobiembre ken Marso?","The correct answer is **C: Dramatiko a paset ti Falls**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""No panagtutudo (Nobiembre agingga Marso), ti kadakkel ti danum ket nangatngato ken ti Busay ket napigpigsa."" This means the volume of water is higher and the spray is intensified during those months, creating a more dramatic view of the falls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nalawag a paset ti Falls** - The passage says the spray is *more* intense, which would likely *obscure* the view, not clarify it.
*   **B: Basbassit a turista** - The passage doesn't mention anything about fewer tourists.
*   **D: Panangliklik ti panawen ti tudo** - While it mentions the rainy season, the benefit highlighted is the increased water volume and dramatic effect.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalukagum no agus-usar ti drone tapno ag-film?","The correct answer is **D: Panag-film laeng kadagiti adu taona a lugar a saan unay a maamiris ti drone.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ti panagpatayab ti drone idiay asideg iti airport wenno iti ngato ti adu a tattao ket saan a nasayaat nga ideya, uray no saan nga ilegal daytoy iti lugaryo.""  This means filming *over* crowds is discouraged, even if legally permitted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panangkita iti naisakbay no mapalubusan ka nga ag-film** - The passage *encourages* checking what video recording is allowed.
*   **B: Panaggun-od ti kanayonan a panaglisensia** - The passage mentions the need for permits/licenses if required.
*   **C: Panagsukisok kadagiti pammalubos** -  Similar to A and B, the passage advises researching permissions.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, sadinno dagiti kasayaatan a lugar a maka-video babaen ti drone?","The correct answer is **D: Kadagiti lugar a nakagun-odan dagiti naisakbay a permiso.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""No agusarka ti drone, kitaem nga umuna no ania ti maipalubos nga alaam iti video ken no ania dagiti permiso wenno nayonna a lisensia a kasapulan."" (If you use a drone, first find out what video restrictions are allowed and what permits or necessary licenses are needed.)  This directly supports the idea that proper permission is crucial for safe and legal drone videography.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While avoiding crowds is mentioned as a safety concern, the passage doesn't say it's a *good* place to film, just that it's *not a good idea* to fly over them.
* **B:** The passage links regular photography rules to video, but doesn't say that places difficult for photography are *best* for video.
* **C:** Occupied areas are specifically warned *against* in the passage.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti keddeng maipapan ti kasapulan ti panagrehistro para ti proseso ti visa ti saan nga agpaypayso?","The correct answer is **A: No agnanaed ka kadagiti pagdagusan ti turista, mabalin a saanmo a kasapulan ti agparehistro**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""daytoy a linteg ket saan a klaro, isu nga ammuem sakbay ti amin"" (this law is not clear, so know before all) and ""Ngem, daytoy a linteg ket saan a klaro, isu nga ammuem sakbay ti amin"" (But, this law is not clear, so know before all) and ""daytoy a linteg ket saan a klaro, isu nga ammuem sakbay ti amin"" (In some cases, only those staying outside of tourist areas need to register). This directly implies that staying *within* tourist areas might exempt you from registration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amin a pagilian ket mangikasapulan ti panagrehistro kadagiti lokal nga agturay** - The passage specifically says this isn't always true (""iti dadduma a pagilian"" - in some countries, and the entire point is to *check* if it's required).
* **C: Ti panagsarungkar kadagiti opisina ti imigrasion ket mabalin a kasapulan** - The passage *does* mention this as a possibility (""Mabalin a kasapulan ditoy ti mangpunno iti pormulario...sarungkaran dagiti opisina ti imigrasion"").  So it *is* something that might be required, not something that isn't.
* **D: Iti sumagmamano a lugar, dagiti lokal a hotel ket mangestimar iti panagrehistro** - The passage *also* mentions this as a possibility (""Iti kaaduan a nasion nga adda kastoy a linteg, dagiti lokal a hotel ti mangestimar iti panagrehistro""). So it *is* something that might be required, not something that isn't.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti lugar a saan a papanan ti turista tapno magawayan ti panagrehistroda?,"The correct answer is **C: Ti lokal a post office**.

Here's why:

The passage states that registration typically happens at:

*   Local police stations
*   Immigration offices
*   Hotels (often they handle it for guests)

It also mentions that registration is *sometimes* only required for those staying *outside* of tourist areas.  A post office is not mentioned as a registration location.

Therefore, a local post office would **not** be a place to register.



"
Siasino ti saan a magunggonaan iti panagboluntario bayat ti panagbiahe?,"The correct answer is **B: Maysa a tao nga agbirbirok ti naan-anay a sueldo** (A person looking for a substantial salary).

Here's why:

The passage states that many volunteer opportunities *provide* room and board, and *some* offer a small stipend. It explicitly suggests volunteering can help *reduce* travel costs, not generate significant income. Therefore, someone seeking a good salary would likely *not* benefit from this type of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maysa a tao a mangnamnama a mangaramid ti baro a gagayyem iti ballasiw-taaw** (A person hoping to make new friends across cultures) - The passage highlights making new friends as a benefit.
*   **C: Maysa a tao a mangnamnama a makaadal ti baro a kabaelan** (A person hoping to learn a new skill) - The passage mentions gaining new perspectives and skills.
*   **D: Maysa a tao a mabalin nga interesado iti room and board** (A person who might be interested in room and board) - The passage explicitly states that room and board are often provided, making this a positive aspect for volunteers.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, kasano a makagunggona ti panagboluntario bayat nga adda iti ballasiw-taaw iti maysa a biahero nga addaan iti budget?","The correct answer is **C: Maidiaya no maminsan ti room and board**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...mayat nga ubraen daytoy tapno bennaten ti badyet tapno nabaybayag ti panagian iti maysa a lugar gapu ta adu nga ubra a boluntario ket mangmangted ti kwarto ken pagianan...""  This translates to ""...it's a good way to lower the budget to extend a stay in a place because many volunteer jobs provide room and board...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ti sueldo ket nalabit a kanayon a maipapaay** - The passage says *some* volunteer positions provide a small salary, not that it's always guaranteed.
*   **B: Gagangay nga agturong dayta kadagiti gundaway iti trabaho** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Makatulong dayta tapno makagun-odka iti direksion** - While volunteering can be personally fulfilling, the passage focuses on the financial benefits for travelers with a budget.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin a maibilang a gagangay iti panagbiahe idiay Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **B: Panagtalinaed iti off-site a hotel**.

Here's why:

The passage states a ""typical"" Disney World trip includes staying at a hotel ""that is not within the Disney bubble."" This means staying *outside* of Disney-owned properties is part of the typical, or ""gagangay"" (typical/common) experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagtalinaed ti maysa a lawas iti panagkita kadagiti parke** - The passage doesn't define the length of stay as what makes a trip ""typical.""
* **C: Panagtalinaed ti intero a biahe iti sanikua ti Disney** - The passage *contrasts* this with the typical experience, saying the typical trip is *not* entirely within the Disney bubble.
* **D: Panag-bus manipud ti airport a paapan iti hotel** - While mentioned, this is just one component of the trip, not what defines it as a typical one.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng maipapan ti Walt Disney World ti saan nga agpaypayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagiti tiket ti park-hopper ket mabalin a maiyakar kadagiti dadduma pay nga agbibiahe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: **""dagiti tiket ket saan a maiyakar.""** (tickets are non-transferable). Option A contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Adda ti on-site a pagtalinaedan a sidadaan** – The text mentions staying ""idiay Disney hotel,"" which confirms on-site lodging.
*   **C: Adda dagiti sidadaan a bus tapno maiyakar dagiti agbibiahe manipud ti airport paapan ti sanikua** – The text states “aglugan ti bus a mapan idiay Disney hotel.”
*   **D: Dagiti tiktiket a multi-day ket masansan a mabirukan kadagiti website para auction** – The text says tickets are found on sites like eBay and Craigslist.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a parikut ti nalabit a saan a masakup iti propesional a klase ti panagsanay wenno kadagiti naisurat?","The correct answer is **C: Ti kinasagana iti lugar a paggugubatan** (The abundance of wilderness areas).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagiti libro ken magasin maipanggep iti panagbiag ti kasamsamekan ket adu, ngem dagiti naisurat maipanggep iti gubgubat ket manmano."" This means there are *many* resources about survival, but *few* resources about wilderness/forest areas themselves (the environment where survival skills are used). The training course will cover this in detail, implying it's a gap in existing knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti panagbiag iti naranggas nga aglawlaw** (Living in the wilderness) - The passage says there are *many* books and magazines about this.
* **B: Ti panagsagana ti umuna a panangtaripato** (Administering first aid) - The course *includes* first aid training.
* **D: Panangtulad iti karakter** (Character building) - The course *includes* character simulation.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad a maad ti nalabit a masakup ti propesional a klase ti panagsanay?","The correct answer is **A: Umuna a panangtaripato** (First aid).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*adu ti umuna a panangtaripato* ken no maminsan ket panagsanay iti panagusar ti armas."" ( ...a lot of first aid and sometimes training in the use of weapons). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dagiti lugar a paggugubatan** (Areas of conflict) - The training is *for* areas of conflict, but isn't the training itself.
*   **C: Ti panagbiag iti naranggas nga aglawlaw** (Life in a red environment/dangerous situation) - While the training prepares you for this, it isn't the specific skill covered.
*   **D: Dagiti delikado a lawlaw** (Dangerous environments) - Similar to B, this is where the training applies, but isn't the training *itself*.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti kasayaatan iti panangliklik ti mabalin a nakontaminado a danum?","The correct answer is **B: Gumatang ti nakabote a danum**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ket no addaanka ti pannakaseknan, ket mabalin a mapanunotmo a gatangen ti danummo a nakakarga ti seliado a bote aggapu iti mapagtalkan a kompania.""  This directly translates to ""...and if you are unsure, you might consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ipaburek ti danum iti sumagmamano a minuto** - While boiling is mentioned, the passage says the *time* it takes to boil varies and effectiveness differs. It's not presented as the *best* solution when you're unsure.
* **C: Ipaburek ti danum iti maysa minuto** - The passage specifically states that boiling for a minute *may not be enough* in some cases.
* **D: Kitaen no addaan kadagiti partikular a peggad ti danum** - The passage mentions specific pests, but doesn't say *checking* for them is the best initial step; it implies different methods are needed for different pests.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania ti mabalin nga kasla imposible uray para kadagiti nalalaing nga lumalangoy?","The correct answer is **C: Panaglangoy a kontra ti kuriente** (Swimming against the current).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kaaduan kadagiti ipapatay ket mapaspasamak a kas resulta ti pannakabannog iti panaglangoy kontra iti kuryente, a dandani imposible.""  This translates to: ""Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from swimming against the current, which is nearly impossible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panaglangoy iti asideg ti reef** (Swimming near the reef) - The text says currents are *found* near reefs, but doesn't suggest swimming there is impossible.
* **B: Panaglangoy iti naadalem a danum** (Swimming in deep water) - While the text mentions fast currents can originate in deep water, it doesn't say swimming there is impossible.
* **D: Panaglangoy iti lawlaw dagiti kuriente** (Swimming in the path of currents) - The text says swimming *with* the current isn't difficult, not that swimming *in* it is impossible.



"
Ania ti aramidem no matiliwna ka ti kuriente?,"The correct answer is **A: Padasen a rumuar iti kuriente babaen ti panagigandat iti sabali a direksion, ken normal nga aglangoy agpasubli iti baybay** (Try to swim out of the current by angling to the side, and then swim back to shore normally).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Apaman a makaruarka iti kuriente, ti panaglangoy nga agsubli ket saan a narigaten."" (When you find yourself in a current, swimming back is not difficult.) and ""Padasem a agyan iti lugar a saankan to matiliwen, wenno... mabalin nga agurayka laengen iti pannakaisalakan."" (Try to swim out of the area you cannot escape, or... you can just wait to be carried out.) This indicates angling *out* of the current is the recommended approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aglangoy a naparpartak a kontra ti kuriente** (Swim forcefully against the current) - The passage states this is ""dandani imposible"" (almost impossible) and leads to drowning.
* **C: Aglangoy iti sabali a direksion** (Swim in another direction) -  This is too vague. While angling *is* swimming in another direction, the passage specifically advises angling *to get out* of the current.
* **D: Aglangoy iti baba ti rabaw ti danom** (Swim under the surface of the water) - The passage doesn't mention this strategy and it wouldn't necessarily help escape a rip current.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania a lokasion ti mabalin a bisitaen a kastilyo a naparbeng para ti holiday excursion?","The correct answer is **C: Iti Rhine Valley**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions visiting castles in the Loire Valley *and* the Rhine Valley as examples.**
* While the passage mentions other waterways (Danube, Erie Canal), it doesn't specifically state castles are a feature *of* those locations in the same way it does for the Rhine Valley.
* Option D is too broad - the passage gives specific examples, not just any inland waterway.
* Options A and B mention waterways, but not castle visits.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a maikalikagum a singasing para kadagiti babbai nga agbibiahe iti lugar?","The correct answer is **D: Usaren ti kinatibker no kasapulan.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly advises women to *avoid* strongly approaching men and *not* to rely on charm (regardless of cultural differences).  This directly contradicts option D, which suggests using force if necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Liklikan ti panagisao maipapan ti kasasaadmo kas babai:** The text recommends stating you are married, even if not true, to avoid issues. This implies avoiding detailed discussions about your marital status.
*   **B: Agannad kadagiti kultural a panagduduma a mabalin a mangipakita ti nainget a panangtignay manipud kadagiti lokal a residente:** The text warns about cultural differences leading to perceived offenses and advises caution in behavior.
*   **C: Liklikan ti panagusar kadagiti nagilap nga alahas:** The text suggests a ring (not overly flashy) is acceptable, implying avoiding *excessive* or noticeable jewelry.



"
"Base ti lugar a nailadawan iti mabasa, ania ti makatulong a singasing para kadagiti babbai nga agbibiahe?","The correct answer is **B: Agisuot ti dakkel a singsing tapno maipakita ti kasasaadmo kas addaan ti asawa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically recommends that women traveling should state they are married, *even if their actual marital status is different*, and suggests wearing a ring (not overly flashy) to indicate this. This is a direct cultural consideration to avoid unwanted attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amirisen dagiti saan a kadawyan a masapul a suruten** - While understanding cultural differences is important, this is too general and doesn't reflect the specific advice given.
*   **C: Maawatan a dagiti panagduduma ti kultura ipasimudaagda a liklikam a pagtalinaedem ti takdermo** - The passage warns about potential offense and discomfort, not necessarily avoiding interaction altogether.
*   **D: No maiduron ti saan mo a kayat, agbalin a natibker iti panangliklik kadagiti lallaki** - The passage recommends being firm and avoiding relying on politeness, which isn't quite the same as proactively being aggressive.



"
"Base iti mabasa, ania a kasasaad ti mabalin a mangikasapulan ti retratista a mangusar kadagiti lente ti espesialidad?","The correct answer is **A: No mangal-alada ti ladawan aglalo dagiti babassit a pinarsua**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dagiti bambanag a kas iti pangen dagiti billit wenno maysa a bassit a pinarsua, kasapulan ti sabsabali pay a lente."" This directly indicates that special lenses are needed when photographing small details or subjects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While commercial use *might* require specific equipment, the passage doesn't directly link it to needing special lenses.
* **C:**  The passage mentions animals being shy, but doesn't say this necessitates different lenses.
* **D:** Park regulations are mentioned, but they don't dictate *when* a specialized lens is needed, just that there might be rules around photography.



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas mabalin a karit para kadagiti retratista dagiti atap nga ayup?,"The correct answer is **C: Panagala ti pammataudan iti tipo dagiti lente a kasapulan**.

Here's why:

The passage *does* discuss lenses – it mentions the need for telephoto lenses and other lenses for different situations (like close-ups). It doesn't say it's *difficult* to *know which lenses to use*, only that different situations require different lenses.  The passage highlights the challenges of *finding* animals (A), dealing with *dangerous* animals (B), and working in *challenging weather* (D).

Let's look at why the other options are correct challenges mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Panagbirok kadagiti partikular nga eksotiko nga ay-ayup** - The text specifically states ""Adu nga eksotiko nga ay-ayup ti narigat a mabirokan...""
*   **B: Pannakikadua kadagiti nauyong nga ay-ayup** - The text says ""Mabalin a managbabain wenno nauyong dagiti atap nga ayup.""
*   **D: Panagtrabaho iti mabalin a delikado a lawlaw** - The text says ""Mabalin a nalamiis, napudot, wenno napeggad ti aglawlaw..""



"
Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti nalabit a mangigapu kadagiti basbassit a problema para ti agmanmaneho nga agbi-biahe kadagiti rabaw iti bantay?,"The correct answer is **B: Nababa ti risiris**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Kadagiti nayelo ken naniebe a kalkalsada, nababa ti risiris ket saanka a makapagmaneho a kas no addaka iti aspalto."" (On icy and snowy roads, traction is reduced and you cannot drive as if you are on asphalt.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nabayag a trapiko (Long traffic):** While possible in mountainous areas, the passage doesn't directly link it as a *direct* result of the conditions.
* **C: Nalabes a panagagneb (Excessive fog):** The passage mentions fog as a visibility issue, but it's not the primary driving *problem* caused by ice and snow.
* **D: Nalapdan a panagkita (Limited visibility):**  Also mentioned, but a *consequence* of snow/ice, not the fundamental issue affecting control.



"
Ania ti nalabit nga agtalinaed a saan nga agbaliw maipapan ti buis ti kita kadagiti agduduma a pagilian?,"The correct answer is **C: Sadinno ti pagidatagam** (The amount to be declared).

Here's why:

The passage states that while *how* income tax is structured (rates, brackets, levels - federal/local) *varies* between countries, the fundamental thing that remains consistent is that income earned while working abroad **must be declared** in the country of residence. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dagiti rates (Rates):** The passage explicitly says rates differ.
* **B: Pannakaurnos (Structure/System):** The passage explicitly says the structuring of income tax differs.
* **D: Dagiti braket (Brackets):** The passage explicitly says brackets can differ by region.



"
"Segun iti mabasa, no agtartrabahoka iti sabali nga ili a sabali a lugar ti nakabayatam, sadino la ketdi ti pangidatagam iti buis ti kitam?","The correct answer is **C: Iti pagilian nga agdama a pagtrabahoam**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states: ""ti panagtrabaho idiay sabali nga ili ket kasapulan a mangidatag ti buwis ti kita idiay pagilian a nakabatayam."" (working in another country requires paying income tax in the country where you are based).  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kadawyan no sadinno ka ti nakabatayam** - This is too vague and not directly stated in the text.
*   **B: Iti Estados Unidos** - The text uses the US as an example of a country with different tax levels, but doesn't state you *always* pay taxes there.
*   **D: Sadinno a nabbabba dagiti masingir** - This talks about tax rates being different, but not where you pay them.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad a keddeng ti saan nga agpaypayso a mangiladawan ti Pangipabuyaan ti Lubong?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti pagilian ket saan a kasapulan a makipaset.**

Here's why:

The passage states ""basta addada iti agsinnabali a nasion"" (as long as there is a willing nation), implying participation is *not* mandatory. The Expo can only happen if a nation volunteers to host.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly says presentations *can* show the history or culture of a country.
*   **B:** The passage mentions horticultural expositions include botanical displays *alongside* artistic and educational exhibits.
*   **C:** The passage states the events ""agbayag iti baet ti tallo ken innem a bulan"" (last between three and six months).

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti alagaden ti Pangipabuyaan ti Lubong wenno Eksposision ti Lubong?,"The correct answer is **C: Dagiti pasamak ket masapul nga agbayag ti agingga innem a bulan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dagitoy a pasamak ket gagangay nga agbayag iti baet ti tallo ken innem a bulan..."" (These events generally last between three and six months...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions showing national culture and world issues, it doesn't state it's a *requirement* that all displays *must* cover these topics.
* **B:** The passage says yearly events are *theoretically* possible, but not practical, meaning participation isn't guaranteed annually.
* **D:** The passage states ""...basta addada iti agsinnabali a nasion..."" (as long as there's a willing nation), implying not all countries need to participate for an Expo to happen.

Ti panangaramid ti ania kadagiti sumaganad ket mangkissay ti posibilidad ti panangraut ti ay-ayup?,"The correct answer is **D: Panangbuteng kadagiti ay-ayup iti maibelleng a makan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""dagiti ayup latta ket naatap ken saan a mabalin a pakanen wenno buriburen."" (The animals are wild and should not be fed or bothered.) Feeding animals habituates them to humans, makes them less fearful, and *increases* the risk of them approaching people and potentially attacking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panagitugot kadagiti aromatiko nga herb (Using aromatic herbs):** The passage warns *against* strong smells, saying they can attract bears.
* **B: Panagikkat ti basuraan iti lugar ti pakarso (Picking up trash in the campsite):** This is a *good* practice and would *decrease* the risk of attracting animals.
* **C: Panagtalinaed ti 25 a yarda a kaadayo manipud kadagiti lobo (Staying 25 yards away from wolves):** The passage actually recommends *more* distance from wolves (100 yards/meters) and bears. Following the recommended distances *decreases* risk.

Ania kadagiti sumaganad ti saan a naibaga iti mabasa kas mabalin a gapu dagiti panangraut ti naatap nga ay-ayup?,"The correct answer is **D: Dagiti ayup a saan a naruam kadagiti tattao** (Animals that are not friendly to people).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Bison, elk, moose, bears, and deer *can* be aggressive. It doesn't say the animals are *inherently* unfriendly, just that they *can* attack.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and mentioned in the text:

* **A: Dagiti napigsa nga angot (Strong smells):** The passage states strong smells can attract bears and other wildlife.
* **B: Saan a pannakamentenar ti distansia (Not maintaining distance):** The passage repeatedly emphasizes maintaining safe distances from animals and states injuries happen when people don't.
* **C: Panangited ti taraon iti naatap nga ayup (Feeding the wildlife):** The passage clearly states animals are protected and shouldn't be fed or bothered.
