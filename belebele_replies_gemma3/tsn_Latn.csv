"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se o ka reng ga se kakantsho e ntle ka go tshameka korosetina?","The correct answer is **B: O se ka wa tshikinyega mo go sa tlhokegeng go boloka maatla a gago**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...o leke go re o seka wa dira motshikinyego o o kgethegileng ka menwana ya ga go.""  This translates to ""try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers"".  The passage emphasizes efficiency and avoiding strain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go oketsa modumo, tobetsa dikonopo ka maatla** - The passage *directly contradicts* this, saying you don't need to press hard for a loud sound, like on a piano.
* **C: Nna kelotlhoko fa o tobetsa dikonopo o ntse o repisitse seatla** - While focus is good, the passage doesn't specifically mention needing to be careful *while* repeating a pattern.
* **D: Oketsa lobelo le o dirisang sekgono go oketsa bolumo nyana** - The passage mentions speed *or* pressure for louder sounds in the context of a corset, but not specifically for finger technique.



"
"Fa o tshameka korosetina, ke eng mo go tse di latelang, e e tla thusang go oketsa modumo?","The correct answer is **A: Go oketsa lebelo** (To increase speed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mo korosetineng, go bona modumo o mogolwane, o dirisa kgatelelo kgotsa **lebelo le legolwane** mo meubeng.""  This translates to ""In a piano, to get a louder sound, you use pressure *or* **speed** on the keys.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tobetsa ka maatla.** (To press forcefully) - The passage says you *don't* need to press hard for a loud sound on a piano.
* **C: Go se tobetse ka maatla.** (Not to press forcefully) - While true, this doesn't *increase* the volume, it just explains how a piano works.
* **D: Go se tshikinye monwana thata** (Not to shake the finger hard) - This relates to avoiding a specific technique mentioned in the first part of the passage, but isn't about *increasing* volume.



"
Ke ka ntlha ya eng ditshwantsho tse di mo thelebisheneng di segilwe melelwane?,"The correct answer is **B: Gore setshwantsho se khurumetse sekirini sotlhe.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Seo se diretswe go netefatsa go re setshwantsho se khurumetse sekirini sotlhe."" (This was done to ensure the picture fills the entire screen.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go letlelela tlhaloso ya se se buiwang** - While subtitles are often at the bottom, the passage focuses on *why* the image is cropped, not to make room for subtitles.
* **C: Go letlelela phetogo e e motlhofo gore e nne ka tsela e nngwe** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Go ntsha mafoko a a tlhalosang gore a se ka a nna gaufi thata mo tlase** - The passage *mentions* this as a *problem* that can occur when making DVDs, but it isn't the *reason* for cropping in television broadcasts.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mathata afe a a latelang, a motho a ka kopanang le one fa a fetolela filimi kwa sebopegong sa DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Setshwantsho se se sa khurumetseng sekirini sotlhe.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a common problem when transferring films to DVD is that the image might not fill the entire screen due to ""letterboxing"" (tswantsha phetelela).  This happens because TV shows are often formatted to appeal to a wide range of televisions, resulting in black bars at the top, bottom, and sides. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mafoko a a tlhalosang a ntshitswe go se kae:** While the passage mentions subtitles being cut off, it doesn't say they are *removed*. They can be *unseen* because of the letterboxing.
* **C: Setshwantsho se se khurumetsang sekirini sotlhe:** This is the opposite of the problem described.
* **D: setšhaba sa Mokgatšha wa Indus:** This is irrelevant to the passage.



"
Masole a Borithane a ne a le mo lefelong lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Molapo wa Assunpink**.

Here's why:

The passage states General Ewing ""ralala noka kwa Trenton Ferry...a feta a gapa borogo ja kwa godimo ga **Assunpink Creek** mme a thibele masole ape a mmaba go re a seka a kgona go sia."" This indicates the British troops were being prevented from crossing/moving past Assunpink Creek.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Trenton:** While the passage mentions Trenton (as the ferry location), it doesn't say the British were *in* Trenton.
*   **C: Bordentown:** Bordentown is where General Cadwalder was planning a distraction, not where the British were located.
*   **D: Princeton:** Princeton isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Ke mosaeno wa ga mang o o tlhagelelang mo tlhomong ya mokwalo?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the unsigned draft was sent to ""the printing shop of one John Dunlap"".  It then goes on to say the copies produced there are known as ""the Dunlap broadsides"". This clearly establishes John Dunlap as central to the printing and distribution of the document.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: George Washington:** He *received* a copy and ordered it read to his troops, but wasn't involved in the initial printing.
*   **C: John Nixon:** He was the one who first publicly read the declaration, but not the printer.
*   **D: Charles Thomson:** He was the secretary who signed the document, but not the printer.



"
"Mo mafelong a a latelang, matlhakore a mabedi a Dunlap a gorogile kwa kae la bofelo?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kopololo ya sone e ile ya goroga kwa London ka di-10 tsa Phatwe."" (A copy of it arrived in London on August 10th). This directly answers the question about where a copy of the Dunlap broadside ultimately reached.



"
Masole a ga Colonel Stark a ne a le kwa kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka fa bokone, go bapisa legora**.

The passage states: ""Banna ba ga Stark ba ne ba tsaya maemo a bonego bapisa legora, ka fa bokone jwa maeno a bakolone."" This directly translates to ""Stark's men took positions overlooking the fence, on the north side of the colonist's defenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mo metsi a felelang teng, fa letshitshing lo lonnye.** - This describes a location where a lower group opened a gap, not where Stark's men were positioned.
*   **C: Ntlheng ya bokone-botlhaba jwa setlhakatlhake.** - This is where the gap in the fence was opened, but not where Stark's men *were*.
*   **D: Fa pele ga legora.** - While they were near the fence, the passage specifies they were *overlooking* it, from the north side."
"Go ya ka serapa, banna ba ga Stark ba ne ba oketsa lorako leng?","The correct answer is **B: Go fitlha ba ka metlha ba feta pale**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gridley kana Stark o ne a tlhoma pale sekgala se ka nna dikgato di le 100 (30m) fa pele ga legora a bo a laela go re ope a seka a hula go fitlha ba ka metlha ba feta pele."" This directly translates to them increasing the rampart/lorako *until* they could collectively cross the abatis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the colonists *requested* more soldiers, the text doesn't say they increased the rampart *because* of this request.
*   **C:** The mention of the Mystic River is context, but doesn't directly trigger the rampart increase.
*   **D:** The text doesn't mention soldiers thinking about positions; it focuses on the physical construction and a specific order related to crossing the abatis."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e neng e le ka nako ya fa China e ne e tletse tshololo ya madi?","The correct answer is **D: Motlha wa Magosi a Mararo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Magosi a le Mararo e ne e le nngwe ya dipaka tse di tletseng tshololo ya madi thata mo hisitoring ya China wa Bogologolo..."" (The Era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most turbulent periods in ancient Chinese history...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka lolwapa lwa segosi lwa Jin:** While the Three Kingdoms period *led* to the Jin dynasty, the passage doesn't say the Jin dynasty itself was a time of intense warfare.
*   **B: Ka nako ya ga Xi’an:** Xi'an is a city, the location of the imperial court. It's where the fighting *happened*, but not the period itself.
*   **C: Ka lelwapa lwa segosi la Han:** The Three Kingdoms period *followed* the Han dynasty, as the passage notes (""fa gare ga Lolwapa Lwa Segosi lwa Han le Jin"").  The Han dynasty wasn't the period of intense conflict described.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se e leng boammaruri ka setlhopa sa masole a ditshoswane a neng a aga manno a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha letsatsi le letsatsi?","The correct answer is **C: Megwantlo e, e nna e tsaya lebaka la malatsi a tla nna 17.**

Here's why:

The question asks for a *truth* about the ant soldiers building their nests daily. The passage states explicitly that it takes about 17 days for the entire process to complete. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di lala di tsamaya bosigo.** - This is true about the ants in general, but doesn't specifically relate to *building the nests*.
* **B: Fa a felelwa ke dijo.** - This explains *why* they start migrating, not the nest-building process itself.
* **D: Di bothologa motshegare** - This is incorrect; the passage states they rest during the day (motshegare).



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko a fe a a bontshang sentle gore setlhopa sa masole a ditshoswane se aga manno  a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha tsatsi  le letsatsi?","The correct answer is **C: Di fetola mesima ya bone letsatsi le letsatsi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""masole a aga manno a nakwana, a a agiwang sesha tsatsi le letsatsi."" This directly translates to ""the soldiers build small nests, rebuilding them each day.""  ""Di fetola mesima ya bone letsatsi le letsatsi"" means ""they change their nests daily,"" which captures this rebuilding aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di aga mesima bosigo:** The passage says they *travel* at night, not build nests.
* **B: Megwanto e e nna e tsaya lebaka la malatsi a tla nna 17:** This refers to the *duration* of the migration, not the nest building.
* **D: Di dirisa mesima e e tshwanang fa di ntse di le mo kgatong:** The passage specifically states they *rebuild* the nests, implying they don't reuse them.



"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang di tlile go tswelela le fa go na le dilo tse dingwe tse di diregang ko ntle?,"The correct answer is **A: Dilo tse di diragalang mo teng ga tsone** (Things that happen within them).

Here's why:

The passage states that internal processes and behaviors are *strongly linked* to evolution and how it changes over time. It also mentions that internal systems can adapt well and *continue to thrive even without external stimulation*.  This directly supports the idea that what's happening *inside* an organism is what allows it to persist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Meribo ya nako le nako** (Time and eras) - While time is *related* to evolution, it's not what *continues to thrive*.
* **C: Dinako tsa tlholego** (Times of evolution) - Similar to B, this is a timeframe, not a sustaining element.
* **D: Meribo e e lebeletsweng** (Expected eras) - This doesn't align with the passage's focus on internal adaptation.



"
Ke lefoko lefe le le tlhalosang mongwe le mongwe yo o bontshang ditshwano tsa mokgwa tse di farologaneng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ditshedi (Polymorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ha bangwe ba bone ba supa dikai tse di farologanang le tsa ba bangwe, gate ke batho ba ba iphetolang ga ntsi, mo ka teme ya seeng go tweng 'polymorphic'.""  This directly translates to ""When some of them exhibit different characteristics than others, that is people who vary greatly, in this context called 'polymorphic'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dilo di direga ka tsela e e tshwanang (Things happen the same way):** This describes a uniform situation, the opposite of what the question asks for.
* **B: Ditshedi (Seeds):**  This is unrelated to the context of characteristics and variation. It's a repetition of option C and doesn't fit the meaning.
* **D: Medumo e e tshwanang (Similar sounds):** This also has no connection to physical characteristics or variation within a population.



"
Ke mafoko afe a a tshwanang a detshedi tse di dulang mo lefelong le le rileng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ditshedi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines ""monomorphic"" as all individuals in a population having the same characteristics (phenotype).**  This directly relates to the *species* or *organisms* within a location.
* **The question asks about what is the same among organisms living in a certain area.**  ""Ditshedi"" (organisms/species) is the best fit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dilo di direga ka tsela e e tshwanang (Things happen the same way):** This is too general and doesn't relate to the definition provided.
* **B: Palo ya batho (Number of people):** The passage discusses organisms, not specifically *people*.
* **D: Medumo e e tshwanang (Similar sounds):**  Sounds aren't the defining characteristic of a monomorphic population.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang o kare ga e se sekai sa tiro ya tlhago ya bojanala?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsamaya go ya ko diphororong tsa metsi** (Going to water resorts).

Here's why:

The passage describes ecotourism as being about appreciating natural beauty, plants, and animals, and activities like hiking, fishing, birdwatching, and learning about ecosystems. 

* **A: Go tsamaya go ya ko diphororong tsa metsi** (Going to water resorts) - Water resorts are typically developed for leisure and entertainment, *not* focused on experiencing a natural environment in a respectful and educational way. They often involve artificial attractions.
* **B: Go tsaya ditshwantsho tsa malomo a naga** (Taking pictures of landscapes) - This directly aligns with appreciating natural beauty.
* **C: Go etela diparaka** (Visiting parks) -  The passage explicitly mentions visiting parks.
* **D: Go tshwara tlhapi** (Fishing) - The passage lists fishing as an activity.

Therefore, going to water resorts is the only option that doesn't fit the description of ecotourism provided in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e leng motheo wa tsamaiso ya dipalangwa?","The correct answer is **B: Dikoloi tsa beng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that everyone is connected to ""mafatlhatlha a mesepele a a dirisang dikoloi tsa beng"" (ancestral resources used by vehicle owners) and can receive help from it. This strongly suggests that the system of *dipalangwa* (presumably a network or system described in the broader context) is *founded* on these resources and the vehicles they relate to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lefelo la tiro (Place of work):** While the passage mentions people traveling to work, it doesn't say the place of work *is the foundation* of the system.
*   **C: Lefatshe le le ikemetseng (Independent world):** The passage mentions a self-sufficient environment in the distant past, but not as the foundation of the current system.
*   **D: Go iphetogela ga batho (People's mobility):** Mobility is a *result* of the system, not its foundation.  People are able to travel *because* of the ""dikoloi tsa beng"".



"
Dilwana tse di dikologileng nutlease di na le mofuta ofe wa maatla?,"The correct answer is **A: Di tlhatlhetswe booketsego** (They are positively charged).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Di-proton di na le ngoka motlakase mme di-neutron ga di na motlakase."" (Protons have a positive charge and neutrons do not have a charge.)
* The question asks about particles orbiting the nucleus (which are protons).
* Therefore, the particles orbiting the nucleus have a positive charge.



"
Nutlease e nale dilwana dife?,"The correct answer is **A: Di-neutron le di-proton**.

The text explicitly states: ""Togwa e na le dikarolo di le pedi - di-neutron le di-proton."" (The nucleus has two parts - neutrons and protons).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di-neutron le proton** - While correct in the components, the wording ""di-neutron le proton"" is less precise than ""di-neutron le di-proton"" as used in the text.
* **C: Diileketerone le diporotone** - The text clearly states electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **D: Diporotone, dinuterone le di ileketorone** -  Electrons are not part of the nucleus.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e leng sekai sa nomore e e nang le dinomore tse pedi tse tlhano?","The passage states that binary numbers only have two digits: 0 and 1. We need to find the option that *only* contains 0s and 1s and has five digits.

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: 1010** - Contains only 0 and 1, and has four digits.
*   **B: 12001** - Contains '2', which is not a binary digit.
*   **C: 10010** - Contains only 0 and 1, and has five digits.
*   **D: 110101** - Contains only 0 and 1, and has six digits.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**."
Dinomore tse di nang le dinomore tse pedi di bidiwa eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Manathwana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nomoro e kgaoganyang e ka nna le nomoro tse pedi fela, sekai 0 kana 1, nomoro tse di bitswa dinomoro tse di kgaoganyang fa o dirisa puo ya di khomputara.""  This directly describes binary numbers – numbers consisting of only 0 and 1.
* **Manathwana** translates to ""digits"" or ""binary digits"" (bits) in this context, referring to the 0 and 1 used in the binary system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Boleng (Value):**  While numbers *have* value, it doesn't define *what* numbers with only two digits are called.
* **Puo e e faphegileng (Different language):** This is too broad; it doesn't specifically relate to the numbers themselves.
* **Dipopego (Symbols):**  While 0 and 1 *are* symbols, ""manathwana"" is the more precise term for the digits in a number system.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse go sa buiwang ka tsone mo serapeng jaaka e le tse di solegelang molemo moithuti yo o nang le taeari ya inthanete?,"The correct answer is **B: Phokotsego ya go tshwaiwa phoso ke dithaka (Reduction of being misled by mistakes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *benefits* of blogging for students.** It talks about improved writing skills (A), increased awareness of the world (C), and motivation to learn (D). These are all explicitly mentioned.
* **The passage *doesn't* mention anything about protecting students from making mistakes or being misled.** While blogging encourages critical thinking, it doesn’t guarantee students won’t encounter or make errors. It focuses on the positive outcomes *despite* the possibility of making mistakes (the student learning to write carefully to avoid criticism).

Therefore, option B is the only one *not* discussed as a benefit in the provided text.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tsa dikarolo tsa go dira taeari mo ithaneteng e e bontshiwang e tlhotlheletsa moithuti go tokafatsa bokgoni jwa bone jwa go kwala?,"The correct answer is **A: Go araba dilo tse di mo inthaneteng ganngwe le gape** (Responding to things online repeatedly).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ka go nna tlhaga mo go arabeng ditirelo tsa mo inthaneteng, baithuti ba kgona go tsaya maemo a bone sentle mo go ba bangwe ka go kwala le go tlhalosa ponelopele ya bone mo dikgwetlhong tse dinnye"" – This directly translates to ""by being natural in responding to things online, students are able to take their positions well among others by writing and explaining their perspectives in small points.""  Responding to online content encourages writing and articulation of thought.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Go batla go itlhokomolosa go tshwaya diphoso** (Wanting to avoid making mistakes): While important, this is about *avoiding* writing, not enhancing it. The passage focuses on the benefits of *doing* the writing.
* **C: Go baya leitlho kgatlhego ya babadi** (Paying attention to the interests of readers):  This is about audience awareness, which is a potential benefit, but not the primary way the passage suggests blogging improves writing skills.
* **D: Go batla go dirisana** (Wanting to collaborate): Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging (""go tiisa tirisano-mmogo""), but the passage specifically highlights the act of *responding* (writing) as the driver for skill development.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse di sa tsweleng mosola tsa puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang ya baithuti? ,"The correct answer is **B: Go bua le molaedi ba lebane mo matlhong ka nako nngwe le nngwe ya letsatsi** (Talking to instructors face-to-face at any time of the day).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication *allows* students to send questions to instructors ""at any time of the day... and expect a fairly quick response *instead of waiting for a face-to-face meeting*.""  This highlights the benefit of *not* needing to meet in person immediately.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with asynchronous learning:

* **A: Go dirisa inthanete jaaka motswedi** (Using the internet as a source) - The passage states the internet provides access to information ""at any time.""
* **C: Go fetofetoga ga diura tsa go dira** (Flexibility of working hours) - The passage mentions the ability to study at one's own pace and on a variable schedule.
* **D: Go laola lobelo** (Controlling the pace) - The passage says it allows students to study at their own pace and control the learning process.



"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tsa puisano e e sa diregeng ka nako e e tshwanang, e e sa fetogeng go rekegela baithuti?","The correct answer is **A: Lobelo lwa go ithuta (Learning pace)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the described method (likely online/distance learning) ""letlelela baithuti go bereka ka nako ya bone, le go laola lobelo la tsamaiso ya dithuto"" which translates to ""allows students to work at their own pace, and control the speed of the learning system.""  This means the *learning pace* is not fixed or the same for all students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Diura tsa tiro (Working hours):** The text mentions ""ditekanyetso tse di nnye tsa nako"" (limited time constraints) but doesn’t say working hours are flexible. It allows for variable *completion* time, not necessarily variable working hours.
* **C: Dibuka tsa ditaelo (Textbooks):** The passage doesn't discuss textbooks being flexible.
* **D: Tiriso ya inthanete (Internet use):** The internet is presented as a tool *allowing* flexibility, not as something flexible in and of itself. It provides access at any time, but doesn't change *itself* to suit the student's needs.



"
"Ga go a umakiwa eng mo temaneng e, se motho a ka se golaganyang le dikago tsa bogologolo?","The correct answer is **A: mogorogoro wa ntlo-lehitshwana** (the ruin of a cottage).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""go kiba ga tlhako mo matlapaneng le go nkgelwa ke letsholo se se tswang mo teng ga megogoro ya ntlo-lehitshwana"" (feeling the chill in the stones and being overcome by the dampness from the ruins of a cottage). This directly connects the feeling of the past with the physical remains of a cottage ruin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Metshameko (Battles)** - While the passage mentions sounds of past battles, it doesn't specifically connect them to something *found* at the site.
* **C: Masole a a ipaakanyeditseng ntwa (Soldiers preparing for war)** - The passage evokes a sense of past conflict, but doesn't describe preparations.
* **D: Batlhabani (Warriors)** - Similar to soldiers, warriors are part of the historical imagery, but not a tangible thing one would find.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang mo serapeng jaaka monkgo kgotsa modumo o o kgonang go diriwa jaaka kgakgamatso mo matlotleng a dikago tsa bogologolo?,"The correct answer is **C: Mediro**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions hearing the sounds of battles (""medumo ya ntwa""), the clashing of swords (""go kiba ga tlhako""), and the dripping of blood (""letsholo""). It also refers to visions of knights and legends, which can be considered ""dintwa"" in a broader sense (battles/conflict). 

""Mediro"" (stories/tales) are the *source* of the legends and imagery, not something *experienced* as a sound or sensation within the ruins themselves.  The ruins trigger thoughts *about* mediro, but mediro aren't directly perceived as a sensory experience like the other options.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle Kago ya bogologolo ya ga Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Go ne go tlhokega kago ya phemelo e nnye ka ntlha ya tlhago e e kagiso ya naga eo ka nako ya fa e ne e agiwa.**

Here's why:

The passage states that when Kirby Muxloe was built in the 1480s, there was ""kagiso e e rileng mo nageng"" (great peace in the land) and defense was only needed against ""setlhotshwana sa digongwana tse di ebelang le go tsamaya di senya"" (small bands of thieves and marauders). This clearly indicates that a strong fortress wasn't necessary – a lesser manor house was sufficient due to the peaceful environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While Lord Hastings started its construction, the passage doesn't say the walls were *thick* or specifically built *by* him for strength.
*   **C:** The passage states the opposite – it *was* unusual for the time to be more of a manor house than a fort.
*   **D:** The passage explicitly states it wasn’t built to withstand major assaults.



"
Ke efe ya dikarolo tsa kago tse di latelang di neng di tsewa e le tse di sa tlwaelegang mo go Kagong ya bogologolo ya ga Kirby Muxloe ka nako e e tlhalosiwang mo serapeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Difensetere tse dikgolo** (Large windows).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Difenstere tsa yone tse di tona...ne di ka seke tsa kgona go emelela tlhaselo e e mashetla..."" This directly translates to ""Its tall windows...could not withstand a serious attack...""  The passage highlights that the tall windows were *unusual* for a defensive structure. They weren't practical for defense, suggesting they were a stylistic choice rather than a functional one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Motheo o o agailweng gore e kgone go dirisiwa fa go le ko ntweng** (Foundation built to be used in war) - The passage says the castle wasn't built for large-scale warfare, only to defend against small raids.
*   **C: Go ne go se na kago ya phemelo mo dikagong tse dingwe tsa bogologolo** (Other early castles didn't have keeps) - The passage says the castle *seemed* more like a manor house than a true defensive keep, implying other castles *did* have keeps.
*   **D: Mabota a masesane** (Thin walls) - While the walls were thin, this isn’t presented as an unusual feature, just a consequence of the lack of major conflict.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e ne e se mosola fa motabogi a ne a ipaakanyetsa paka e e tlang?","The correct answer is **B: O tsepamisitse mogopolo mo lobelong fa a ikatisa.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""lebelo ga le sa tlhole le nna botlhokwa thata, fa maatla le tiisetso e nna tsone konokono."" (speed is no longer as important as strength and stability).  This directly contradicts focusing on speed/lobelo during preparation. The passage emphasizes strength and stability as the priority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ikatisetsa motabogo wa naga ka selemo:** The passage doesn't mention the duration of preparation.
*   **C: Go taboga ko tlase ga metsotso e e meraro ya nako:** The passage states a good climber can do it in *two* minutes, so under three minutes isn't a problem.
*   **D: Go dirisa lefelo la go ikatisa mmele o o ko godimo:** The passage explicitly supports using the upper body for leverage as a *better* technique.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e botlhokwa thata mo phaposing ya ntlha mo motaboging yo o sa tabogeng sekgala se se leele thata?","The correct answer is **D: Go lwela go taboga ka lebelo ka boitshoko**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""lebelo ga le sa tlhole le nna botlhokwa thata, fa maatla le tiisetso e nna tsone konokono."" and ""boitshoko bo tshwanetse bo tlhagolelwa ka ditsela tsotlhe.""  This directly highlights that *effort* and *determination* (boitshoko) are now more important than speed (lebelo) when tackling a difficult climb.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions using a 'paka ya mariga' (handhold) as a *comparison* to a more effective technique, not as the most important thing.
*   **B:**  While attempting to climb the 'sephatlho sa maele' (rock face) is the goal, the passage emphasizes *how* one approaches it.
*   **C:** The passage only mentions a skilled climber being *able* to climb in two minutes, not that it's essential.

"Go motabogi, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e se kitlang e kgona go fitlhelelwa fela ka go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla?","The correct answer is **D: Boitekanelo jwa ka gale**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that consuming carbohydrates *can* negatively impact the overall **equilibrium (boitekanelo)** of younger athletes.  It doesn't say it *enhances* it.  The other options (performance, enjoyment, and higher-level performance) are all stated as things that *can be helped* by managing carbohydrate intake properly.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A: Tokafatso ya tiragatso (Performance improvement):** The text says managing carb intake can help athletes *optimize* their performance.
*   **B: Boitumelo jo bo oketsegileng (Increased enjoyment):** The passage explicitly mentions increasing enjoyment.
*   **C: Tiragatso ya maemo a a ko godimo (High-level performance):** Similar to A, carb management can contribute to higher-level performance.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang jaaka tsela e motabogi yo o monnye a ka bonang boitumelo thata mo motshamekong o a o tshamekang?","The correct answer is **B: Go nna ka gale a taboga ka tsela e e kwa godimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that focusing *solely* on increasing muscle mass (""dikotla"") can negatively impact the overall well-being of young athletes and potentially harm their performance. It emphasizes the importance of balanced strength, hydration, and understanding various training methods.

Option B – overtraining (""taboga ka tsela e e kwa godimo"") – is the only option that describes a potentially *harmful* practice that would detract from enjoyment and overall well-being.  The passage implies that prioritizing muscles *to the exclusion of other factors* is problematic.

Let's look at why the other options are good practices mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Go ikatisa go ja dijo tse di nang le dikotla** - The passage acknowledges the importance of protein (""dijo tse di nang le dikotla"").
*   **C: Go nwa metsi thata** - The passage explicitly mentions ""mekgwa e e berekang ya go nwa metsi"" (effective hydration strategies).
*   **D: Go nna a nale maatla a itekanyetseng a a siameng** - The passage emphasizes ""go boloka tekano e e itekanetseng ya maatla"" (maintaining balanced strength).



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang motabogi yo o tabogang mo sekgala se se mo magareng a reka sedirisiwa sa tlhwatlhwa e e kwa godimo?","The correct answer is **A: Ke seo ba se batlang** (It's what they want).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...batsayakarolo ba metshameko ba ka nna ba ikutlwa e ka re ba rata setlhagiswa se se rileng le fa se sena mesola epe mo go bone."" This directly translates to ""participants may feel like they prefer the sensation even if it has no benefit.""
* This means people buy the higher-end equipment simply because they *want* to, even if it doesn't demonstrably improve their performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E bontshitswe e solegela molemo:** (It has been shown to be beneficial) - The passage explicitly says many don't have a significant impact.
* **C: E tlile go dira gore ba kgone go taboga:** (It has enabled them to ski) - This isn't the reason *why* they buy it, just a general ability.
* **D: Go nale dipuo tse di sa tlhomamang ka didirisiwa tse e seng tsa tlhwatlhwa e e ko godimo:** (There are conflicting opinions about non-high performance equipment) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* someone would choose the more expensive option.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se batabogi ba ba tabogang sekgala se se mo magareng ba se tlhokang?","The correct answer is **A: Di dirisiwa tse mmalwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dilo di ka rekwa go ya ka mo di tlhokegang ka teng, mme bontsi jwa tsone bo ka se nne le tshusumetso epe mo tiragatsong."" This translates to ""Things can be bought according to need, but many of them may not have much impact on performance.""  This directly implies that participants *need* some equipment (""dilo"" or ""things"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba tshwanetse go nna le kitso ka go taboga** - While skill is important, the passage focuses on *what they need to acquire* (equipment), not inherent knowledge.
* **C: Didirisiwa tse mmalwa thata** - The passage says many pieces of equipment don't significantly affect performance, so ""difficult equipment"" isn't the key need.
* **D: Madi a mantsi** - The passage mentions things can be *bought*, suggesting money is involved, but doesn't state it's a primary *need* – it’s the equipment itself that's needed.



"
Ke mang a boneng kgogego ya makenete ya nutlia? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch le Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI e berekela mo maranyaneng a a bidiwang 'nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)', e e lemogilweng mo dingwageng tsa bo-1930 ke **Felix Bloch (wa Stanford University) le Edward Purcell (wa Harvard University)**.""

This directly indicates that Bloch and Purcell discovered nuclear magnetic resonance. While Damadian later applied this discovery to medical imaging, he didn't discover the underlying principle.
"
Ke ka ngwaga o feng go ne gwa newa patente ya ntlha ya kgogedi ya setshwantsho sa kalafi? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The text states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1977, Dr. Damadian o ile a fetsa go aga sediriswa sa maranyane a """"mmele otlhe"""" sa MRI, se a neng a se bitsa """"Indomitable"""".""  This implies that the first full-body MRI scanner was completed in 1977, and therefore the patent would likely have been granted around that time as well.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se batho ba tshwanetseng go se tlhaloganya gore ba kgone go itse ditiro tsa nama tse di diriwang ke batho ba bangwe?","The correct answer is **A: Keletso (Empathy)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the importance of understanding *how others feel and their intentions, along with their beliefs, knowledge and values*.  This is the definition of empathy – the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. The example given (the person breaking into a car) highlights needing to consider *why* someone might do something, not just assuming the obvious negative intention.  This requires *keletso* (empathy) to understand the desperate situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maitlhomo (Habits):** Habits are repeated behaviors, but don't explain *why* someone acts a certain way in a specific situation.
* **C: Tumelo (Belief):** While beliefs are part of understanding someone, they don't encompass the full scope of understanding motivations and feelings.
* **D: Temogo (Patience):** Patience is helpful in many situations, but it doesn't directly relate to understanding the *reasons* behind someone's actions.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go tlhaloganaya maitlhomo go thusa batho gore ba dire eng?","The correct answer is **D: Go bala ditlhaloganyo tsa ba bangwe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *ditshiding tsotle* (empathy) is about being able to understand how others feel, their motivations, beliefs, knowledge and values.  It’s about understanding what’s going on in their minds. This directly translates to ""reading the minds"" or understanding the thoughts and feelings of others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ntsha maisaitsiweng a a mo morago ga ditiro tsa nama:** This translates to ""extracting information after physical actions,"" which isn't the core of empathy.
*   **B: Go bonela pele dikeletso:**  This means ""predicting decisions,"" and while empathy *might* help with that, it's not the primary function.
*   **C: Go leba batho ba bangwe ntle le go ba tlhaola:** This means ""looking at others without judging them."" While related to empathy (being non-judgmental is helpful), it’s not the definition of empathy itself.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tlhalosang sentle tshobokanyo ya mosola wa AI?","The correct answer is **D: Go itirela tiro** (To perform a task/to self-act).

Here's why:

The paragraph states that AI research ""includes making machines capable of performing tasks that require intelligence.""  ""Go itirela tiro"" directly translates to performing tasks or self-acting, which aligns perfectly with the definition of AI given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go rulaganya (To plan):** While planning is *part* of intelligence, it's not the encompassing definition of AI.
* **B: Go itse ka lentswe (To understand speech):**  Speech recognition is *an application* of AI, not the core definition.
* **C: Go dira thulaganyo (To make an arrangement):** This is too specific and doesn't capture the broader goal of AI.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e AI gantsi amangwang le yone?","The correct answer is **D: Go itsege ga mokwalo (Recognizing writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...bokgoni jwa go araba dipotso tsa bareki, **go lemoga mokwalo**, lentswe le sefatlhego."" ( ""...the ability to answer customer questions, **recognize writing**, voice and image."") 

While AI is used in all the options to some extent, the passage *explicitly* mentions recognizing writing as a capability of AI.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e leng maatla a mongwe yo o kgonang go akanya a tsepamisitse mogopolo?","The correct answer is **A: O kgona go bona dikarabo tse dintsi mo bothateng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a key aspect of this type of thinking is ""go batlana le kitso"" (seeking knowledge) and not limiting oneself to a single truth. It specifically contrasts this with the idea of only seeing two options (true or false).  Therefore, someone who can see many answers to a problem demonstrates the core trait described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O kgona go dirisa ditsela tse disha mo bothateng:** While helpful, the passage doesn’t emphasize *new* ways, but rather utilizing *existing* connections (""go dirisa dithulaganyo tse di setseng di le teng"").
*   **C: O tsaya nako go rarabolola mathata:** The passage highlights *efficient* thinking - being able to grasp and remember things easily. Taking a long time isn't mentioned as a strength.
*   **D: O kgona go tshwarelela dipopego ka tlhogo:** While remembering things is a positive attribute mentioned, it's a *result* of this type of thinking, not the core *ability* it describes.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e motho yo o kgonang go akanya a tsepamisitse monagano a sa tsepamisang monagano mo go yone?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlhaloganya gore go nale karabo e le nngwe fela e e leng boammaaruri**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kgangkgolo ya tlhaloganyo ke: go na le karabo fela e le nngwe e e leng boammaruri. O akanya fela ka dikarabo tse di bidiwang ya nnete le e seng tsa nnete."" This defines the core focus of this type of thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tsaya nako ya gagwe** - While helpful, it's not the central focus described in the passage.
* **C: Go lemoga mabaka** - This *is* mentioned as part of the process, but not the defining characteristic.
* **D: Go batlana le kitso** -  Also part of the process, but not the core principle of this specific type of thinking.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e tsewang e le go ntsha maikutlo a mannye?","The correct answer is **A: Go leba gosele fa a bua**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the video recording led to ""important discoveries in the expression of subtle emotions."" It then specifically mentions that people can recognize sarcasm by paying attention to ""the way a person's facial parts move."" Looking away while speaking (go leba gosele fa a bua) is a subtle facial cue that can indicate deception or insincerity, and therefore, could be associated with expressing subtle emotions like sarcasm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go tsholetsa dintshi (Shaking)**: While shaking can be an emotional response, it's not specifically mentioned as a cue for recognizing sarcasm or subtle emotions.
*   **C: Go panyapanya matlho gantsi (Blinking frequently)**: Frequent blinking isn't directly linked to the expression of sarcasm in the passage.
*   **D: Go emisa kgonotswe (Clearing your throat)**: This is a physical action, but not a subtle facial cue related to emotional expression.



"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a a tlhalosang go ntsha maikutlo a mannye e seng boammaruri?,"The correct answer is **B: Tlhaloso e e siameng e ka lemoga maaka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""go buiwa go re motho o kgona go lemoga go re a motho o bua maaka ka go ela tlhoko ka fa dikarolwana tsa sefatlhego sa gagwe di tsamayang ka teng."" This directly supports the idea that a truthful interpretation can detect falsehoods (in this case, lies or sarcasm).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Direkoto tsa bidio di lebisitse kwa dithibololong tsa botlhokwa mo tlhalosong ya maikutlo a mannye** - This just states *that* microexpressions were recorded; it doesn't say anything about detecting falsehoods.
* **C: Puo le tebego ya sefatlhego e ka tlhalosiwa** - While true according to the passage, it doesn't specifically relate to identifying deception. It's a broader statement.
* **D: E ka thusa go lebelela gore a go tswa pelong** - This is too vague and isn't explicitly discussed in the passage. The passage focuses on *how* lies might be detected (through facial movements), not just whether something feels ""genuine.""



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e nnileng ya botlhokwa ka ntlha ya Tsosoloso? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ka fa re anamisang kitso** (How we share knowledge).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Totatota, motlha wa tlhabologo o fetotse ka fa re ithutatang ka teng le ka fa re anamisang kitso ka teng."" (In totality, the landscape has changed in how we learn and how we share knowledge.) This directly highlights the shift in *how* knowledge is disseminated as a key change brought about by the rise of the internet (implied by ""selekanyo sa serepodi"" - the internet/digital age).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go gakologelwa o le esi** (Being remembered as a person) - The passage mentions memorization becoming more difficult, not the importance of personal recognition.
* **C: Go gakologelwa molaetsa** (Memorizing messages) -  The passage states memorization *decreased* in importance.
* **D: Go amogela kitso** (Receiving knowledge) - While access to knowledge changed, the passage focuses more on *how* that knowledge is shared and understood, rather than simply receiving it.



"
"Ka ntlha ya Tsosoloso, ga go a gatelela efe ya dilo tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go gakologelwa molaetsa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mme go kgona go gakologelwa molaetsa e ne ya nna selo sa konokono."" ( ""...but the ability to remember messages became a necessity."")  This directly addresses how remembering information (messages) changed with the rise of writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go gakologelwa o le esi:** The passage doesn't focus on remembering things *exactly* as they were said, but on remembering messages generally.
* **B: Go iponela tshedimosetso:** While the passage *mentions* a change in how information was gathered, it doesn't say that gathering information itself was emphasized by writing.
* **D: Go iponela tshedimosetso:** This is a duplicate of B, and for the same reason, incorrect.

The passage highlights that *before* writing, remembering messages was crucial because there was no external record. Writing changed this – making the ability to *recall* messages less vital, but the ability to *record* them more so.  Therefore, the emphasis shifted to remembering *the message itself* became essential before writing existed.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa kayeng tlhotlheletso ya go dirisa inthanete go tsweledisa botsalano?,"The correct answer is **A: Go itsalanya ka tsa kgwebo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions these as motivations for internet use:

*   ""go ithuta"" (learning)
*   ""go tsalana le batho"" (socializing/connecting with people)
*   ""Kamego ya botho"" (personal identity)
*   ""go tsweledisiwa wa dikamano"" (developing relationships)

These all relate to personal connection and growth.  **""Go itsalanya ka tsa kgwebo"" (business transactions)** is a purely commercial activity and isn't mentioned as a driving factor for using the internet as a means to foster relationships or personal fulfillment in the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go tsweledisiwa ga dikamano (Developing relationships)** - This is *directly* stated as a benefit/motivation.
*   **C: Go batla tshedimosetso ka leeto (Searching for travel information)** - While not directly stated, this falls under ""go ithuta"" (learning).
*   **D: Go kopana le batho ba basha (Meeting new people)** - This is related to ""go tsalana le batho"" (socializing).



"
"Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang, e e sa kayeng tlhotlheletso ya go dirisa inthanete go itsenyaletsa?","The correct answer is **A: Go batlana le tsela ya go apaya**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on positive motivations for using the internet: learning, socializing, personal identity, and relationship building.  It doesn't mention seeking ways to cheat. In fact, the overall tone suggests the internet is used for *enhancing* connections and self-improvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlhaeletsana ga batho (Socializing with people)** - Directly mentioned as a key motivation in the passage.
* **C: Go batlana le didirisiwa tsa kalafi (Searching for educational resources)** - ""Go ithuta"" (learning) is explicitly mentioned.
* **D: Go leba tsamaiso ya tsa ditšhelete (Monitoring financial systems)** - While not *explicitly* mentioned, the passage refers to increased opportunities related to what the internet can be used for, and financial management could fall under that broader category.



"
Ke leng fa Bophirima jwa Yuropa bo neng jwa lesa go ikamaganya thata le tlhotlheletso ga mmogo le go simolola kapari ya yone?,"The correct answer is **A: Middle Ages se ya fifing** (As the Middle Ages faded).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa sebaka se se bidiwang Middle Ages se ya fifing, mafatshe a bophirima ja Yuropa a ne a simolola go itlhamela kapari ya bone."" This directly translates to ""As the Middle Ages faded, Western European countries began to adopt their own style.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Setso sa ma Byzantine** - While Byzantine culture *influenced* Gothic style initially, it wasn't *when* Western Europe started adopting its own style.
* **C: Ka dingwaga tse 25 morago ga Dingwaga tsa Magareng** -  The passage mentions a delay of 25-30 years compared to the East, but it doesn't say this is *when* Western Europe began to develop its style, just that they lagged behind.
* **D: Ka lekgolo la bo 11 la dingwaga** - The passage doesn't specify a particular century for the start of Western Europe's adoption of the style.



"
Go dirisa dikonopo go kopela diaparo go nnile le ditlamorago tsa eng? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mokgwa wa se-Gothic**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nngwe ya ditlhabologo tsa nako tsa teng, ka ntateng ya dintwa tsa tumelo tsa di-crusades, e ne e le ya go dirisa dikonopo go gagamatsa dilwana.""  This directly links the use of buttons to a development *within* the time period, and that development is part of the Gothic style. The passage goes on to describe how the Gothic style emerged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Setso sa Byzantine:** While the passage mentions Byzantine influence at the *beginning* of the style, it doesn't link button use to that influence.
* **C: Ka nako ya dintwa tsa tumelo:** The Crusades *led to* the use of buttons, but weren't a direct result *of* it. It's a cause, not an effect.
* **D: Ka Middle Ages:** The Middle Ages is simply the time period; it doesn't explain the impact of using buttons.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e bonweng e le tharabololo e e dirileng sebaka se se leele ya mathata a tsa tikologo?","The correct answer is **B: Tiragatso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...fa re sa batle fela tharabololo ya nakwana, re tshwanetse go bona sesosa sa mathata, mme re tshwanetse go se fedisa. Go papametse go re lefatshe le fetogile thata ka ntlha ya **tswelelopele ya batho ya tsa saense le maranyane**, mme mathata a nnile magolo thata ka ntlha ya go ntsifala ga batho le mokgwa wa botshelo jwa batho o o magasigasi.""

""Tswelelopele ya batho ya tsa saense le maranyane"" directly translates to **population growth** (and by extension, *consumption* driven by that growth). This is essentially *tiragatso* – excessive use or exploitation of resources.  The passage frames this as the root cause of the environmental problems, rather than simply treating the *symptoms* (like fighting diseases).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ngala ditshwetso tsa botshelo jwa manobonobo (Mimicking the lifestyle of monkeys)** - This isn't mentioned as a solution or problem in the text.
*   **C: Go bona gore ke eng se se bakang mathata (Seeing what causes the problems)** - The passage states we need to *find* the root cause, but doesn't identify this act as the problem itself, rather a step to solving it.
*   **D: Go nna thuso ya metsamao ya tsa tikologo (Being an aid to environmental movements)** - While helpful, the passage doesn't identify advocacy as the fundamental issue, but rather the underlying drivers of environmental damage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya ditharabololo ya dilo tse di latelang e e bontshiwang e le kalafi e e bonalang ya mathata a tsa tikologo?","The correct answer is **B: Go bona sesosa sa mathata** (To see the cause of the problems).

Here's why:

The passage compares addressing environmental problems to treating an ""allergy to ailments,"" meaning a reaction to the *underlying cause* rather than just the symptoms.  The author specifically states that simply wanting a quick fix (""tharabololo ya nakwana"") isn't enough; we need to identify the *source* of the problems to truly solve them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tsenela tiragatso** (Taking action) - While action is important, the passage emphasizes *knowing what action to take* based on understanding the root cause.
* **C: Go bua dikakanyo ka ga ditshwetso tsa botshelo jo bo magasigasi** (Talking about unsustainable lifestyles) -  This *identifies* a problem, but doesn't necessarily get to the underlying *cause*.
* **D: Go tshela thata ka tsela e e kgonegang ya tikologo** (Living sustainably) - This is a solution, but again, the passage prioritizes understanding *why* things are unsustainable first.

Ke naga efe e Yuropa e neng ya nna le ntwa ya ntlha e mathata a yone a konokono e neng gotwe a nyalana le go dirisa sentle maatla ntle le go tsenyeletsa ba bodumedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ntwa ya Boswa-ja-puso ya Spain ke yone ya ntlha e go neng go lwelwa dithata tsa go busa."" (The Spanish War of Succession was the first war fought over the rights to rule).  This directly answers the question, identifying Spain as the country where the initial struggles over power and maintaining balance occurred, *not* primarily based on religion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Engelane (England):** The passage doesn't mention England being the first to have such a conflict.
*   **B: Jeremane (Germany):** The passage refers to the ""Thirty Years' War"" but identifies it as the *last* war of religion, not the first conflict driven by power struggles.
*   **C: Portugal:** Portugal isn't mentioned in relation to this specific point in the text.



"
Ke ntwa efe e e mo gongwe e tlhalosiwang jaaka ‘ntwa ya bodumedi’?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntwa ya Dingwaga di le Masome a mararo** (The Thirty Years' War).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka jalo, ”Ntwa ya Dingwaga di le Masome a Mararo” e ne e le ntwa ya bofelo go bidiwa ntwa ya tumelo."" (Therefore, ""The Thirty Years' War"" was the last war to be called a war of religion.)
"
Ke dilo dife tse di latelang tsa Kereke ya Katoliki tse di neng di sa tlhatlhobiwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tsenelela ga maatla mo teng ga Kereke** (The infiltration of power within the Church).

Here's why:

The passage states that the accumulation of power and wealth in Rome led many to question whether the Church's beliefs were being *followed* (i.e., whether the Church was practicing what it preached). This implies the problem wasn't with the beliefs themselves, but with the *abuse of power* within the Church.  The passage specifically highlights concerns about whether wealth was actually being used to alleviate poverty as the core beliefs stated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa go bewa ga khumo ya Kereke e ne e siame** (Whether the Church's wealth was correctly allocated) - The passage *questions* this, it doesn’t state it was untroubled. The questioning *is* the problem.
* **B: Fa ditheo tsa konokono di ne di fetolwa** (Whether core beliefs were changed) -  The passage doesn’t mention any changes to core beliefs, just concerns about whether they were being *followed*.
* **D: Fa ditheo tsa konokono tsa Kereke di ne di diriwa ka moo go tshwanetseng** (Whether the Church's core beliefs were practiced correctly) -  This is essentially what the passage is questioning, but ""infiltration of power"" is the root *cause* of the concern.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, Ke mang yo o bolailweng ko Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Motlhokomedi**.

The passage states: ""Ka nako e nngwe lekolo la mogoso le ile a tsikinya tlhogo ya motlhokomedi wa segosi yo o neng a bolawa kwa Versailles fa pele ga Kgosigadi e e neng e tshogile thata."" This directly indicates a *motlhokomedi* (attendant/official) was killed at Versailles.

Ke efe ya tse di latelang e neng e sa patelediwa mo Kgosing le mo Kgosigading ya segopa?,"The correct answer is **A: Go bulwa ga difensetere tsa karana (Opening of small windows)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:**
    *   B: Go tswa botlhaswa mo Versailles (Forced departure from Versailles)
    *   D: Leeto la go boela Paris (The return journey to Paris)
    *   C: Go lebiwa ga go kgaolwa tlhogo ga motlhokomedi (Witnessing the beheading of the guard) - the passage mentions the guard was killed and the queen was present.

*   **The passage does NOT mention anything about opening small windows.** It focuses on the forced march, the hostile crowd, and the violence witnessed.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e eneng e se matswela a ntwa ya sesole sa lewatle e e sa tlwaelegang ya Boritane?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikepe tse eseng karolo di ne di beilwe ka tsela e e sa sireletsegang**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Britain's naval blockade put even neutral ships at risk. This means ships *not* taking sides in the conflict were endangered by the blockade. This directly aligns with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Keletso ya Jeremane ya go dirisa ditsela tsa ntwa e e tse di tshwanang (Germany's request to use similar methods of warfare):** The passage discusses Germany *expecting* similar treatment, not initiating the problematic tactic.
*   **C: Diphetogo tse di dirilweng tsa molao wa lefatshe (Changes to international law):** While the blockade *violated* international law, the initial act wasn't changing the law, it was breaking it.
*   **D: Didirisiwa tse di batlegang di ne di sa bonwe motlhofo (Scarce resources were not found hopeful):** The passage doesn't discuss resource scarcity.

Ke efe ya dilo tse go buiwang ka tsone fano e e sa tlhaloseng thibego ya sesole sa lewatle kgatlhanong le Jeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: E ne e sa tsamaisane le molao wa lefatshe** (It did not comply with international law).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""thibelo eno e ne e tlola molao wa boditšhabatšhaba o ka tlwaelo o latelwang o o atlenegisitsweng ke ditumalano di le mmalwa tsa boditšhabatšhaba mo makgolong a le mabedi a a fetileng a dingwaga."" This directly translates to ""this blockade violated customary international law as codified by several international agreements in the past two centuries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E ne e gakatsa ntwa ya Majeremane ya mo tlase ga lewatle (It provoked the German submarine warfare):**  The passage states Germany *expected* similar treatment in its own submarine warfare, implying it was a response *to* the blockade, not the other way around.
* **C: E ne e kgoreletsa motsamao wa dilwana tsa Jeremane (It increased the movement of German vessels):** The blockade's purpose was to *restrict* movement, not increase it.
* **D: E ile ya netefatsa gore dikepe tse e seng karolo ya ntwa di se ke tsa tshosediwa (It ensured that non-combatant ships were not threatened):**  The passage actually says the blockade *endangered* even neutral ships, meaning it did *not* protect them.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a ka nna le Multiple Sclerosis thata?","The correct answer is **A: Mosadi wa dingwaga tse 32**.

Here's why:

The passage states that MS is more common in women and typically affects people of middle age. A 32-year-old woman fits both of those criteria. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Monna wa dingwaga tse 15** - MS is rare in children and adolescents.
*   **C: Monna wa dingwaga tse 43** - While a 43-year-old man *could* have MS, the passage highlights women being *twice* as likely to get it.
*   **D: Mosadi wa dingwaga tse 10** -  Similar to option B, MS is very uncommon in young children.

"Go ya ka serapa, batsayakarolo mo ditirong tsa ka gale tse di batlang tshegetso e e kwa godimo ya eng?","The correct answer is **C: Kgatelelo ya maikutlo** (Emotional distress).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ba ba tsayang karolo mo ditirong tsa ka gale ba ne ba tlhoka tshegetso e e oketsegileng mabapi le dikakanyo tse di sa siamang kaga go utlwa botlhoko ba bona dipharalogano magareng ga go utlwa botlhoko ga leruri le go sa ikutlwe sentle go go tlwaelegileng ga motsamao wa mmele.""  This translates to: ""Those who participated in past activities needed extra support regarding incorrect assumptions about feeling their pain, differences between real pain and normal bodily discomfort.""  This strongly implies they were struggling with **emotional distress** related to their experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga ba nne le ditlhabi** (They didn't have problems) - The passage explicitly states they *did* have problems and needed support.
* **B: Go bolaiwa ke mokwatla.** (Being victimized by assault) - While mentioned in the passage, it's the *result* of the underlying issue, not what the participants needed support *for*.
* **D: Letshogo** (Headache) -  Headaches are mentioned as a symptom, but not the core issue needing support.  The passage focuses on the psychological impact.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go bewa ga legora gantsi go tshamekiwa jang?","The correct answer is **D: Gantsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Motshameko ga ntsi o tshamekiwa ke batho bale ba bedi ba lwantshana."" which translates to ""This sport is not always played by these two people competing **one-on-one**.""  ""Gantsi"" means ""one-on-one"" or ""individually.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wa segompieno** - ""Of today"" - This refers to the current state of fencing, not *how* it's played.
*   **B: Kwa univesithing** - ""At the university"" - This refers to *where* some fencers are students, not the style of play.
*   **C: Metshamekong ya mafatshefatshe ya diolimpiki** - ""At the world championships of the Olympics"" - This refers to a high level of competition, not the format of a bout.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e le letshwao le le tseneletseng ya botlhole jo bo moteng?","The correct answer is **B: Go tlhatsa go tlwaelegile thata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matshwao, a a tshwanang le **go tlhatsa a tlwaelegile thata** mo e leng go re tlhatlhobo ya ka bonako e ka se kgone go dirwa.""  This directly identifies frequent blistering as a significant indicator of a foundation problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlhatsa** - While blistering is *a* sign, the passage emphasizes *frequent* blistering.
*   **C: Dichefu tsa go phepafatsa ntlo** -  These are a *result* of the foundation problem, not a primary indicator.
*   **D: sejana se se bulegileng sa melemo** - This is also a consequence, a possible entry point related to the issue, but not the defining symptom mentioned in the text.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kgato efe e e tshwanetseng ya ntlha fa o tlhatlhoba motho yo o amegileng?","The correct answer is **C: Lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo fa o mo atamela.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""O tshwanetse go lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo fa o mo atamela..."" (You must recognize the situation as you approach him/her). This is the first action advised when assessing someone who is distressed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo** - While true, it's not specifically about *when* to recognize it, but *as you approach*.
* **B: Sekaseka gore a mme ga o mo diphatseng** - This is about avoiding assumptions, but not the initial step.
* **D: Fa o utlwa botlhoko, o thusa, o dira gore dilo di nne maswe le go feta.** - This is a caution *against* acting impulsively, not the first step.



"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a sa tlhaloseng sentle tsamaiso ya go lemoga motswasetlhabelo?,"The correct answer is **A: O se ka wa thusa fa o utlwa botlhoko.**

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states that while you feel the urge to help when someone is distressed, attempting to do so might actually make things worse. Option A directly contradicts this by saying *don't* help when you feel distress.  

Let's look at why the other options are good descriptions of recognizing distress:

* **B: Lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo pele ga fa o mo atamela.** (Recognize the state of distress *before* approaching them) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Lemoga maemo a motswasetlhabelo fa o mo atamela.** (Recognize the state of distress *as* you approach them) - Also directly stated.
* **D: Se dire gore dilo di nne maswe le go feta.** (Don't make things worse) -  The passage warns against making the situation worse.



Therefore, **A** is the one that doesn't align with the advice given in the passage."
Ke diphetogo dife tse di batliwang thata ke Tshenolo ya SeFora e neng e nale thotloetso thata mo badiring?,"The correct answer is **C: Go gapiwa ga kgopolo ya Rephaboliki** (The spreading of the idea of a Republic).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the French Revolution was about a shift ""from a monarchy to a republic, popular sovereignty and the belief that the country belongs to all the people and not the ruler and master.""  This means the core change sought was the establishment and spread of republican ideals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tshegetso e e tswang ko godimo ya setšhaba** (Support from above the populace) - The passage emphasizes a shift *away* from the authority of the ruler, not seeking support from the elite.
* **B: Go ntsha mogopolo go tswa mo bathong go ya ko kgaisanong** (Removing thought from people to competition) - This doesn't align with the revolution's goals.
* **D: Tsmaiso e ntšhwa ya go lekantsha** (A dismantled system of measurement) - While the passage mentions a shift in ""systems of measurement"" it's used as a metaphor for broader political change, not the main goal of the revolution itself.



"
"Go latelana le Tshenolo ya Fora, katlego mo masoleng le ditiro tse dingwe tse di ne di beilwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **D: Maemo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...go ne gape ga rotloetsa badiri ba bangwe ba bantsi ba ba gateletsweng, ba mafatshe a mangwe, go tsogela dipuso tsa bone kgatlhanong.""  And earlier, ""...maemo a bosole a ikaege ka go re o na le maemo afe mo sechabeng a ne jaanong a ikaegile ka bokgoni."" This directly links success in the military and other endeavors to *maemo* (status/position).  The revolution allowed individuals to rise based on their abilities, changing how *maemo* was determined.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phitlhelelo (Effort)** - While effort is important, the passage emphasizes that success was now tied to *what* position you held in society, not just how hard you worked.
*   **B: Setlhopha (Group)** - The passage doesn't focus on group affiliation as the primary determinant of success.
*   **C: Go gagamalela maemo (Maintaining status)** - The revolution *changed* how status was obtained, it didn't focus on maintaining existing status.



"
Ke tirelo efe ya setšhaba e gotweng ke yone e bakang go sa kgotsofale mo dinageng tse di tlhabologileng?,"The correct answer is **C: Dipalangwa tsa botlhe** (Public utilities).

Here's why:

The passage directly states people are complaining about public utilities (""dipagamo tsa sechaba"") and are dissatisfied with things like water quality and road deterioration – both of which fall under the umbrella of public utilities.  

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Boleng jwa metsi (Water quality)** – While mentioned as *an example* of a problem, it's not the overarching service causing dissatisfaction.
*   **B: Go phutlhama ga marogo (Road deterioration)** – Similar to water quality, it's a symptom of the broader issue with public utilities.
*   **D: Thuto (Education)** – Education isn't mentioned as a source of complaint in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ka tweng ka tsamaiso ya dipalangwa tsa botlhe?","The correct answer is **C: Di baka gore batho ba bantsi ba ba di dirisang ba ngongorege**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* people are dissatisfied with public utilities (like water and roads). The passage states ""Bontsi jwa batho ba ngongoregela dipagamo tsa sechaba"" (Many people complain about public utilities).  Option C directly links the usage of these utilities to the complaints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Botlhe ba dirisa dipagamo tsa sechaba.** - This simply restates a fact from the passage, it doesn't explain *why* there's dissatisfaction.
* **B: Batho ba ikuela ba sa kgwe mathe ka boleng jwa metsi** - This describes a *symptom* of a problem (lack of knowledge about water quality), not the *reason* for the dissatisfaction.
* **D: Mo dinageng tse dintsi tse di tlhabologileng** - This provides a *location* where the problem is evident, but not the *cause* of the dissatisfaction.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e ka nnang boima go e lekantsha ka ntlha ya bakgweetsi ba ba sa itsegeng?","The correct answer is **A: Palo ya pharakano (Number of variations)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dipatlisiso ka pharakano ya dikoloi ke namane e kgolo ya tiro ka jaana o ka se tlhomamise ntle le pelaelo epe ka fa mokgweetsi a ka itsayang ka teng.""  This translates to ""Research on vehicle variation is a major challenge because you cannot reliably determine how a driver feels.""  

Therefore, determining the *number* of variations (differences) in vehicles is difficult due to the subjectivity of driver experience.  The other options are all things that *can* be measured or determined without relying on how drivers *feel*:

*   **Leano la ditsela (Road plan):**  This is a physical layout and can be mapped.
*   **Tiriso ya tsela (Road usage):** This can be quantified by counting cars.
*   **Go tsamaya ga pharakano (Variation movement):** This refers to the patterns of traffic which can be measured numerically.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e dirisitsweng fa go diriwa dipalo tse di bontshitsweng tsa pharakano?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditiro tsa tsela**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bokete jwa dikoloi mo tseleng bona le go tshwana ebile bo kgona go supiwa ka dipalo."" This translates to ""...the density of vehicles on the road is similar and can be quantified with numbers.""

The passage also mentions the three key points used to quantify traffic differences: vehicle flow, density, and speed – all *characteristics of the road and traffic on it* (i.e., road conditions/ditiro tsa tsela).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mokgwa wa mokgweetsi (Driver behavior):** The passage explicitly states that analyzing individual driver behavior is difficult and unreliable.
*   **C: Tsela eo ditsela di dirilweng ka yone (How roads are built):** While road design *influences* traffic, the passage focuses on *measuring* existing traffic, not the roads themselves.
*   **D: Bontsi jwa pharakano (Amount of difference):** This is a result of the analysis, not what is used *to do* the analysis.



"
Ke eng se Hershey le Chase ba se dirisitsweng go tsenya di-DNA tsa bone? ,"The correct answer is **D: Megare**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hershey le Chase ba dirisitse baketeria, **kgotsa megare**, go tsenya DNA ya bone mo teng ga baketeria.""  This means they used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria, also known as phages) to deliver the DNA.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phosphorus ya Marang a a kotsi:** While they *used* radioactive phosphorus in one experiment, it wasn't what they used to *deliver* the DNA.
*   **B: Togwa ya dijini:** This is what they were trying to prove DNA *was*, not what they used for the experiment.
*   **C: Salefa ya Marang a a kotsi:**  This is not mentioned in the passage.

Bokgoni jwa go fetoga ga dijini tse di fetiseditsweng mo losikeng e ikaegile mo go eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa disele tse di amegileng e le tsa losika lwa mogare wa disele.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Phetogo ya dilo ya losika mogare wa disele ke yone fela e e kgonang go fetela ko baneng..."" (Changes in the germline are the only ones capable of being passed on to offspring).  Therefore, the ability of genetic changes to be inherited depends on *whether the affected cells are from the germline*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botlhokwa jwa togwa ya dijini (The importance of gene mutation):** While gene mutation is a *part* of the process, it doesn't determine inheritability.
* **C: Mofuta wa phetogo (Type of mutation):** The type of mutation influences *what happens* (e.g., cancer, cell death), but not *whether it's inherited*.
* **D: Fa phetogo e ka baka loso lwa disele (Whether the mutation causes cell death):**  This relates to the *effect* of the mutation, not its inheritability.

"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e filweng mo serapeng, ditlamorago tsa diphetogo tse di sa tshwaneng ga di a ikaega ka eng?","The correct answer is **D: Mofuta wa phetogo e e amegileng**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go fetoga ga dilo go ka nna le ditshwaetso tse di farologaneng go ikaegile ka **mofuta wa phetogo**..."" (Changes can have different effects *depending on the type of change*...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gore togwa ya dijini e amega go le kana ka eng:** While gene mutation is mentioned, the passage doesn't say effects depend on *how much* of the gene is affected, but the *type* of change.
* **B: Fa disele tsa losika le megare di amegileng ka gone:** The passage mentions which cells are affected, but it doesn't say the *effects* depend on *how* those cells are affected.
* **C: Fa diteng tsa botlhokwa tsa dijini di amegileng ka gone:**  While important genes are relevant, the primary factor determining the effect is the *type* of change, not necessarily *which* genes.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e seng lebaka la gobo ditso tsa kgale di ileng tsa boloka dipodi?,"The correct answer is **C: E ne ele ditsala** (They were friends).

Here's why:

The passage states ancient people kept goats for:

* **Mashi (milk)**
* **Bobowa (cheese)**
* **Nama (meat)**
* **Letlalo bonolo (soft leather)** 

These are practical reasons for keeping livestock.  There's no mention of goats being kept as companions or ""friends.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di ne di ba naya nama (They gave them meat)** -  This *is* a reason mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Di ne di thusa go fula lefatshe (They helped to plow the land)** - While some animals are used for plowing, the passage doesn't mention this as a use for goats.
* **D: Di ne di naya maši (They gave milk)** - This *is* a reason mentioned in the passage.



"
Mokgele wa golofo ke go tsaya eng e nnye?,"The correct answer is **B: Go kgotletsa (To swing)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes golf as a game where players hit balls (""dithobane tsa mothulo"") to prevent them from falling into the water (""dikgwele ka fa mesimeng"").  Hitting the ball *requires* a swing (""go kgotletsa"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dibolo (Balls):** While balls are *used* in golf, the skill of golf isn't simply possessing balls.
*   **C: Nako (Time):** Time is a factor, but not the core skill.
*   **D: Mesima (Fields/Courses):**  Golf is *played on* fields, but the skill isn't the fields themselves.



"
"Mo lebaleng la golofo,  tlhaga e ne e kgaotswe gore e nne khutshwane kae?","The correct answer is **B: Ko botaleng.**

The passage states: ""...tlhaga e e gaufi le mosima e kgaolwa bokhutshwane thata mme e bidiwa """"ko botaleng""""."" This directly answers the question of where the vegetation was cut short.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko lefuting la bolesome le borobedi.** - While the passage mentions the 18th hole, it doesn't say the vegetation was cut short *there*.
*   **C: Mo futing ya ntlha** - The passage states players *start* at the first hole, not that the vegetation is cut short there.
*   **D: Motshameki mongwe le mongwe a simolola kwa lefuting la ntlha** - This is a statement about where players begin, not about the vegetation.



"
"Ke efe ya mothale yo, e e dirisiwang thata mo dipatlisisong?","The correct answer is **B: Go ranola ka fa lefatshe le dira ka teng.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maikaelelo magolo a maranyane ke **ranola ka fa lefatshe le ntseng ka teng**.""  It directly identifies this as the key idea of the ants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ntsha dikakanyo e kgonegang e le nngwe kgotsa mo go oketsegileng** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Go batlisisa** - While ants *do* forage, the passage highlights a more fundamental understanding of their environment.
* **D: Mo dipatlisisong tsa maranyane.** - This simply restates *where* the idea is relevant, not *what* the idea is.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se sa thuseng go batlisisa ka maranyane?","The correct answer is **B: Go dira ditshekatsheko (Making observations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Mothale ôno ke one baitseanape ba o dirisang thata mo dipatlisisong tsa maranyane"" which translates to ""This scientist is one who uses a lot of observation in insect research.""  This implies that observation is *already* being used extensively, and therefore isn't what's lacking.

The passage highlights the difficulty of understanding the current state of the world (""ranola ka fa lefatshe le ntseng ka teng"") and emphasizes the determination of those involved (""ba ba aparela mariga, le fa bantse ba sitwa ga ba kake ba tlhoka go fenya ntwa"") meaning that systematic investigation (experiments, hypothesizing, testing) are needed - things that aren't currently being done enough. Observations alone aren't enough to solve the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go dira tsela e nngwe ya saense (Following a single scientific method):** The passage doesn't suggest a rigid adherence to a single method is the problem.
*   **C: Go ntsha dikakanyo tse di kgonegang (Formulating viable hypotheses):**  The need to understand the world suggests hypotheses are *needed* more than they are a hindrance.
*   **D: Go dira diteko (Conducting tests):** Similar to hypotheses, the passage implies a need for more testing to understand the situation.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mafoko a tlhalosang ka ga ditsuatsue e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Ditsuatsue tse dingwe di kgona go dikologa go fitlha sekgala sa dikilomitara tse 482 ka ura e le nngwe.**

Here's why:

The text states the strongest tornadoes have wind speeds of 480km/h (not 482km/h) and that *severe* tornadoes last for three hours, not travel 482km in one hour. This makes option D an inaccurate representation of the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Ditsuatsue di kgona go senya sengwe le sengwe mo di leng gone** - The text states ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e tlhasela thata mafelo a mannye fa o bapisa le ditiragalo tse dingwe tsa tlhago, fela di ka senya sengwe le sengwe mo tseleng."" (Tornadoes attack places severely compared to other natural disasters, but they can destroy everything in their path.)
*   **B: Ditsuatsue di ama mafelo a mannye go na le diphefo tse dingwe** - The first sentence supports this, stating tornadoes impact fewer places than other natural disasters.
*   **C: Bontsi jwa ditsuatsue bo tsaya go feta diura tse tharo** - The text specifies ""Ditsuatsue tsa diphefo tse di bogale tsa bokete go gaisa tsa dipesente tse pedi di tsaya dioura di le tharo."" (Severe tornadoes last for three hours)



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang a tlhalosang sentle bontsi jwa ditsuatsue?","The correct answer is **A: Di tsaya sebaka sa diura tse tharo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ditsuatsue tsa diphefo tse di bogale tsa bokete go gaisa tsa dipesente tse pedi di tsaya dioura di le tharo."" (Severe tornadoes last for three hours compared to two percent). This directly answers the question about the duration of tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states the wind speed (480km/h), but doesn't mention how far a tornado travels in an hour.
*   **C:** The passage says tornadoes are *especially* destructive, implying they affect areas *more* than other natural events, not less.
*   **D:** While the passage mentions tornadoes uprooting trees, it doesn't describe this as a defining characteristic of their ""size"" or extent.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e ile ya simolola go diriwa ke batho mo lekgolong la bo 16 la dingwaga?,"The correct answer is **D: Go dira di thelesekoupu** (Making telescopes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the *first* telescopes for viewing stars were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century. While people had been using lenses for a long time, the *combination* of lenses into a telescope was a 16th-century invention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go dirisa dilense** (Using lenses) - The passage states people used lenses ""for millennia,"" not just in the 16th century.
*   **B: Didiriswa tsa go godisa mafoko** (Communication devices) - The passage doesn't mention communication devices.
*   **C: Go dira lense** (Making lenses) - Similar to option A, lens making predates the 16th century.



"
Batho ba ntse ba dirisa didirisiwa tsa go godisa ba dirisa dilense lobaka lo lo kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Go simologa ka mafelelo a lekgolo la bo 16 la dingwaga**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the *first* telescopes to show stars were made in Europe *towards the end of the 16th century*. The question asks when people started using lenses for magnification, and the passage links that directly to the invention of telescopes in that timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dingwaga tse sekete (A thousand years)** - The passage mentions glasses being used for a very long time, but doesn't specify a thousand years.
*   **C: Dingwaga tse sekete (A thousand years)** - Same issue as option A.
*   **D: Go simologa ka tshimologo ya lekgolo la bo 16 la dingwaga (Beginning of the 16th century)** - The passage says ""towards the end"" of the century, not the beginning.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, legaga la ga Muhammad le bua eng ka ditiro tsa gagwe tsa semoya kgotsa boleng?","The correct answer is **A: O bontsha boleng jwa kagiso le go batla go nna a le nosi** (He shows a value of peace and a desire to be alone).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes Muhammad's seeking of solitude in the cave of Hira for contemplation.** This demonstrates a desire for peace and a need to connect with something greater than himself through quiet reflection.
* The description of the cave's remoteness and difficulty to find further supports this idea – it was a place specifically chosen for its isolation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Modumo wa ko ntle o ka thusa go tlhatlhanya** (Outside noise can help to analyze) - The passage focuses on the *lack* of external stimuli, not its helpfulness.
* **C: O tlhoka nako e nnye a le nosi** (He needed little time to be alone) - The passage doesn’t discuss the *amount* of time, but the *act* of seeking solitude.
* **D: O ne a tshwenyegile ka go bonwa le go utlwiwa** (He was worried about being seen and heard) - The passage actually highlights how difficult it was to *find* the cave, suggesting it provided the desired anonymity, not a source of worry.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, tshipi e ne e dirisediwa eng pele?","The correct answer is **C: Maotwana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tshipi ya seporo e ne e senya maotwana a logong a dikolotsana. Fa go ntse go tsweletse, maotwana a dirilweng ka legong a ne a fetololwa go dirisiwa a tshipi."" This clearly indicates that steel was first used to make the *maotwana* (wheels) of the carriages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go kgaoganya matsela** - The text doesn't mention steel being used for road construction.
*   **B: Ditsela tsa karaki** - The text doesn't mention steel being used for tracks.
*   **D: Diporo tsa diterena** - While related to transport, the passage specifically discusses carriages (dikolotsana) *before* the widespread use of trains.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, gore go ntshitswe maotwana a magong ka maotwana a tshipi?","The correct answer is **D: Di ne di tsofadiwa ke tshipi mo maotong** (They were worn out by steel in the feet).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Se se ne sa nna tlwaelo, mme tshipi ya seporo e ne e senya maotwana a logong a dikolotsana."" This directly translates to ""It became a habit, but the steel of the stirrup wore out the wooden feet of the carts.""  This means the steel stirrups damaged the wooden feet, leading to their replacement with steel ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A ne a oketsa lobelo la dipitsi** (They increased the speed of the carts) - The passage says they were *able* to travel at higher speeds, but doesn't attribute that to the feet specifically.
*   **B: A ne a tsewa e le a dirang sentle** (They were known to be effective) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the feet being specifically ""effective"".
*   **C: Di kgona go tsaya dithoto tse dintsi** (They were able to carry more loads) - The passage does not mention load capacity.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se mongwe le mongwe a neng a kgona go se dira ka nako ya Lorato?","The correct answer is **A: Melao**.

Here's why:

The passage states that during Romanticism, things ""were free from rules simply imposed."" This directly implies that one thing people *couldn't* do was be bound by strict rules.  The passage contrasts this freedom with a previous time of more rigid structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Popego ya lefelo (Landscape of the place):** While the passage mentions the landscape interacting with people, it doesn't suggest it was something they couldn't do.
* **C: Ditlwaelo (Customs):**  Customs are implied as being less rigid, not something prohibited.
* **D: Ditso (Culture):**  The passage discusses a shift *within* culture (Romanticism), not a prohibition of culture itself.

Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a sa bontsheng kakantsho ya kakaretso ka go tlhomamisega ga thekelonoloji? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ka moo thekenoloji e amang botsalano jwa setshaba ka gone**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly critiques the idea that technology has inherent, one-way effects on society. It argues *against* the idea that technology simply *causes* changes without being influenced by social factors.  Option A directly addresses this – how technology interacts with (and is potentially shaped *by*) societal relationships.  The passage uses the example of cars and roads to show how societal needs and constraints shape technological development, not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlhamiwa ga thekenoloji ga go a amiwa ke setso** – The passage directly challenges this! It suggests technological development *is* influenced by factors beyond purely technical progression (like societal needs).
* **C: Thekenoloji e ama tlholego mo setšabeng** – This is a statement *supported* by technical determinism (the idea the passage is critiquing). The passage argues against simply assuming this to be true.
* **D: Kgolo ya thekenoloji ga ya ikaega ka tlhotlheletso ya dipolotiki** –  The passage specifically mentions that technical determinism often posits that technological development happens *independent* of political considerations, and argues against that idea.



In essence, the passage is arguing against the simplistic notion of technology as a purely independent force – option A encapsulates that central critique."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang ga di a amana le go goga thapo e e bofilweng?","The correct answer is **D: Go simologa mo segwagweng** (Starting from the frog).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tlase go raya go re o tshwanetse wa simolola ko segogwaneng (ko e le gone letsogo la ga go le tshware bora) o bo o goga bora.""  This translates to ""down-bow means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then draw the bow.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Modumo o o sa tsenelelang** (A sound that is not penetrating) - The passage describes up-bows as making a less penetrating sound, but this doesn't relate to *how* to play a down bow.
*   **B: Letshwao le le tshwanang le seteipole** (A symbol resembling a staple) - The passage mentions notation but doesn't link a staple-like symbol to down bows.
*   **C: Modumo o o tseneletseng** (A penetrating sound) - This describes down-bows *resulting* sound, not how to play them.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe e e latelang e amanang le modumo o o siameng?","The correct answer is **C: Letshwao le le lebegang jaaka V**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Letshwao la mmino la """"up bow"""" le tshwana le V..."" which translates to ""The musical symbol for """"up bow"""" is like V..."".  It directly connects the ""V"" shape to the up bow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Letshwao la mo fatshe la thapo e e bofilweng (A mark on the ground of a stringed instrument)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Go goga thapo e e bofilweng (Plucking a stringed instrument)** - The passage discusses bowing (drawing the bow *across* the strings), not plucking.
* **D: Go simologa mo letsogo la gago le tshwereng thapo e e bofilweng (Starting from the hand holding the stringed instrument)** - While the passage *describes* the motion of a down bow starting from the hand position, it doesn't *define* it as the down bow itself.



"
Marapo a kgale a a bontshang maemo kwa tshimologong go ya ka se se latelang?,"The correct answer is **D: Go tsamaya ka menwana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that early hominids *stopped* using their hands for walking (locomotion). It then explains that fossils from 2-3 million years ago show an evolution in hand structure *from* a hand used for locomotion *to* one used for manipulation and control. This manipulation and control is specifically linked to more developed finger muscles, suggesting an increased ability to walk on their knuckles – which is a form of moving around using their hands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tsietsa (Climbing)** - While chimpanzees climb, the passage focuses on the *change* from using hands for walking, not climbing.
*   **B: Sikara boima (Carrying weight)** - The passage doesn’t mention carrying weight as the initial function.
*   **C: Go tsamaya (Walking)** - The passage directly states that hominids *stopped* using their hands for walking.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tlhalosang sentle dipente tsa marapo a menwana a chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Di dirisiwa go sikara boima**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a chimpanzee's arm and leg are roughly the same length and width. It then explains this is *because* the chimpanzee uses its arms to help support its body weight when walking on all fours (knuckle-walking specifically).  This means the arm/hand structure is adapted for bearing weight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A tlhamaletse go nale a batho (They are more developed than those of humans):** The passage actually states the *opposite* - human hand bones are more specialized and refined.
* **B: Matsogo le maoto a yone ga a lekane ka bogolo (Its hands and feet are not equal in size):** The passage specifically states they *are* roughly equal in size.
* **D: Di dirisediwa sentlentle go tsietsa (They are skillfully used for climbing):** While chimps *can* climb, the passage focuses on how their hands are adapted for weight-bearing during locomotion, not specifically climbing.



"
Tlhopo e ntsha go sa tshwane ga dijini tse diša go tswa mo go tsefeng tse di leng gone?,"The correct answer is **C: Di kgaogantshitswe** (They were separated).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tlhopho e e tlosa go tswa mo setlhopheng sa dipharologano tse di supilweng. Go kgaoganngwa go refosanya phetogo kwa pele le kwa morago fa gare ga ditlhopha tse pedi mo kokomaneng nngwe le nngwe."" 

This translates to: ""The selection removes from the previously identified differences. Separation refines the change before and after between the two groups in each organism.""

This directly indicates that the differences were *separated* due to the selection process. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di fitlhegile (They were found):** While differences were *identified*, the passage focuses on what happened *after* identification - their separation.
*   **B: Di kopantshitswe (They were combined):** The passage describes separation, not combination.
*   **D: Di bontshitswe (They were shown):**  Again, the passage focuses on the *action* taken with the differences (separation) rather than simply showing them.



"
Ke efe ya tsamaiso e e nang le maikarabelo mo go oketseng dijini tse di sa tshwaneng?,"The correct answer is **B: Di kopantshitswe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phetogo ya dijini e dira go re go nne le pharologano e ncha ya dijini, mme tlhopho e e tlosa go tswa mo setlhopheng sa dipharologano tse di supilweng. Go kgaoganngwa le **go kopanngwa** gape go refosanya phetogo kwa pele le kwa morago fa gare ga ditlhopha tse pedi mo kokomaneng nngwe le nngwe.""

This directly links the increase in different genes (and therefore genetic variation) to the process of **""go kopanngwa""** (being combined). The passage explains that combining and separating reshuffles genetic change between the two groups in each chromosome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di kgaogantshitswe** (separated) - While separation *happens*, the passage says it's the *combination* that creates the new variation.
*   **C: Go oketsega** (increase) - This is the result of the process, not the process itself.
*   **D: Di bontshitswe** (displayed) - This doesn't relate to how new genetic differences arise.

"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke efe ya tseno e e ka bonalang e ka jega go rarabolola “bothata jwa poreiteine”?","The correct answer is **C: Ditsie (Eggs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**dijo tsa diphogologolo (ditshoswane, motlhwa, mae) ga di jege motlhofo fela, mme gape di na le dikotla tse dintsi tse di nang le poroteine e bile di na le di-amino acid tse di botlhokwa.**"" (animal foods - insects, milk, eggs - are not only easily digestible but also have many proteins and essential amino acids).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Matlhare a a suleng (Beans)** - The passage mentions beans are difficult for humans to digest without processing.
*   **B: Dinawa tse di sa butswang (Nuts)** - Similar to beans, nuts require processing to be easily digestible.
*   **D: Dikutu tsa malomo (Seeds)** - The passage doesn't specifically mention seeds as a readily available protein source.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya mathata a a latelang e e sa bakiweng ke go tlhoma diasiti ya amino e e tlhokegang?","The correct answer is **A: Mathata a mateng a go sila dijo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Dikotla tse di tswang mo dimeleng tse di itlhelelwang bonolo e ne e ka nna poreteine e e bonwang bonolo mo matlhareng le dinawa, *mme fela, di di thata gore di ka silwa ke mebele ya batho fa di sa apeiwe*.""  This translates to: ""Proteins from easily cultivated plants could be easily digestible in grains and legumes, *but they are difficult for human teeth to break down if not processed*.""  This directly relates to difficulty in *digesting* food, not just obtaining amino acids.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go sa je sentle (Malnutrition):** The passage *directly* links insufficient amino acid intake to malnutrition and its consequences (mental distress, wasting, death).
* **C: Kgolo ya kgatelelo ya mogopolo (Mental distress):** The passage explicitly mentions mental distress as a consequence of protein deficiency (""go tshwenyega thata mo maikutlong"").
* **D: Loso (Death):**  The passage explicitly states that severe protein deficiency can lead to death (""mo kwa bofelong loso"").

Therefore, the only problem *not* directly caused by a lack of essential amino acids, according to the passage, is the *physical difficulty of chewing* plant-based proteins.



"
Maloko a setso se se rileng gantsi a bontsha jang gore a amana le setlhopha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka go dirisa setaele jaaka tsela ya setshwantsho (By using style as a visual way)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that subcultures express their solidarity through *distinctive styles, behaviors, and ways of speaking, including clothing, hairstyles, and how they express themselves*.  This directly links to using style as a visible marker of belonging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka go batla go amogelwa (By wanting to be accepted):** While acceptance *can* be a factor, it's not the primary way subcultures demonstrate affiliation. Subcultures often intentionally differentiate themselves.
* **B: Ka go dira se bodumedi jwa batho botlhe ba ba ba potileng (By doing what everyone around them does):** This is the *opposite* of what subcultures do. They often actively reject mainstream norms.
* **C: Ka go dira ka moo batho ba dirang dilo ka gone (By doing things the way people do them):**  Similar to B, this describes conformity, not the defining characteristic of a subculture.

"Go ya ka kgopolo e e leng mo serapeng, go ka direga eng ka ngwana yo o bontshang a tswa mo lotsong lo lo rileng le le nang le mokgwa wa go akanya ka boitshwaro jo bo tshosetsang?","The correct answer is **B: Ngwana go ka direga thata gore a itshware ka tsela e e tshosang.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses how children internalize stereotypes about their culture and how those stereotypes can negatively affect their performance and beliefs.  If a child comes from a background perceived as having ""threatening behavior patterns,"" the passage implies they might *struggle* to behave in ways that defy that stereotype, even if they want to. It's not a guarantee they *will* act out (A is too strong), nor does it mean they'll avoid all social situations (C) or reject their heritage entirely (D).  The key is the *difficulty* they face due to the internalized negative perceptions.

The passage highlights the impact of societal expectations and stereotypes on a child's self-perception and behavior.  Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that it would be *difficult* for a child from that background to behave in a non-threatening way, due to the pressures and internalized biases they face.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, kitso ya ngwana ka go akanya ka ditsela tse di rileng ka lotso go ka nna le ditlamorago dife tse di latelang?","The most accurate answer is **B: Boitshwaro (Behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that children *internalize* stereotypes about their culture and how it relates to academic success.  This internalization affects their *performance* - their behavior at school. They may underperform because they believe the negative stereotype about their group.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **A: Lotso lo lo rileng le ba tlhophiwang go itsege ka lone (The stereotype the child is aware of):**  While the child is aware of the stereotype, the passage focuses on the *impact* of that awareness, not just the awareness itself.
* **C: Botsalano le bana ba bangwe (Interaction with other children):** This *could* be a consequence, but the passage directly links the internalized belief to academic performance first.
* **D: Tlhaloso ya bone ya lotso (Their understanding of culture):** The passage doesn't say their understanding of their culture changes, only that a pre-existing stereotype affects their behavior.



Therefore, **Boitshwaro (Behavior)** is the best answer because it’s the most immediate and directly stated consequence of a child’s awareness of negative cultural stereotypes."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e neng e sa tsamaisane le go gola ga ngwana wa phage?","The correct answer is **B: Bokgoni jo bo boteng jwa puo** (Limited language skills).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states these children (""diphologotswana"") were *not* taught how to interact with people as they grew up. This lack of socialisation directly impacts their ability to learn and use language effectively in social contexts. The passage details how they lack understanding of social cues and have difficulty connecting with others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go itshelela** (Shyness) - The passage describes these children as often being fearful and withdrawn, indicating shyness is a *result* of their upbringing, not something that prevents normal development.
*   **C: Mekgwa ya go itlhaola** (Survival skills) - Children raised in extreme circumstances (like by animals or in the wild) would likely *develop* strong survival skills.
*   **D: Go tshaba go nna mogare ga batho** (Fear of being alone with people) - This is a *characteristic* of these children, described in the passage, again a result of their lack of socialisation, not a hindrance to their development.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle mekgwa ya bophage ya bana?","The correct answer is **B: Boitshwaro jwa bophage bo ka bakiwa ke go tlhoka go itsalanya le batho.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ba sa rutiwe go re ba itshole jang mo bathong, fa ba ntse ba gola."" (they were not taught how to interact with people as they grew) and connects this lack of socialization to the development of feral children (""diphologotswana"").
* The passage describes how being raised without human contact (by animals, in isolation) leads to behaviors like fear and distrust of people. This is a direct result of *not learning to relate to others*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While physical development plays a role, the passage focuses on *social* and *emotional* development being stunted due to lack of human interaction.
* **C:** The passage mentions parental fear as *a cause* of neglect, but doesn't state that all feral behavior comes from overly strict parents.
* **D:** While severe psychological trauma can contribute, the passage highlights the *absence* of normal interaction as the primary factor, not necessarily a pre-existing mental illness.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya mekgwa e e latelang e sa tsamaelaneng le temo-thuo ya itshetso?","The correct answer is **B: Go dira dijo tse di rekisediwang ba bangwe (To produce food for sale to others)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines subsistence farming as growing enough food for *oneself and one's family*.  It contrasts this with methods focused on *increasing yield*. Producing for sale (option B) moves away from self-sufficiency and towards commercial agriculture, which is the opposite of subsistence farming.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

* **A: Go tsepamisa mogopolo mo thobong e e lekanang ditlhokego tsa lelwapa la molemi (Focusing on yield to meet the needs of the farmer's family)** - This *is* the core of subsistence farming, as stated in the first sentence.
* **C: Go itebaganya le thobo e e kwa godimo go na le go dirisa methale ya botsipa ja maemo a a fa godimo (Focusing on higher yields rather than using simple methods as conditions permit)** - The passage mentions using stored seeds and other intelligent methods to *increase* yield within a subsistence context.
* **D: Go batla dipeo tsa selegae mo lefelong la molemi (Seeking local seeds in the farmer's area)** -  The passage explicitly states that subsistence farming often uses locally preserved seeds.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e tlhalosang sentle tsela ya go lema?,"The correct answer is **D: E santse e dirisiwa ke balimi mo dinageng tse dingwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Go tswa goo Lowe, balemi-barui ka bontsi ne ba lema, ba ruela go ja mo gae, mme go sentse go ntse jalo mo dinageng tse dintsi tse di tlhabologang."" This translates to ""From there, many farmers farmed, grew to eat at home, and it is still the case in many developing countries.""  This directly indicates that this farming method is *still practiced* in some countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ke tsamaiso yotlhe ya dijo tse di jetsweng** (It is the entire system of foods grown) - The passage describes *a way* of farming, not the entire food system.
*   **B: E dirisa ditsela tse di sa tlwaelegang go godisa dijalo** (It uses unusual methods to grow crops) - The passage states it uses *local resources and traditional methods*, which isn't necessarily ""unusual"". It emphasizes a *natural* approach.
*   **C: E letlelela balemi go abelana ka dijalo tsa bone mo kgaolong ya bone** (It allows farmers to share their crops in their region) - The passage doesn't mention sharing crops; it focuses on growing food for *self-sufficiency*.



"
Go etela museamo go wela mo karolong efe ya go ja nala?,"The correct answer is **C: Bojanala jwa setso**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically defines ""bojanala jwa setso"" (cultural tourism) as tourism where the primary goal is to visit a place to learn about its history and culture.  Visiting a museum directly aligns with that goal - you're going to learn about history, art, and culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bojanala jwa Kgwebo (Business Tourism):** This involves travel for work, not cultural enrichment.
* **B: Bojanala jwa go iketla (Relaxation Tourism):** While museums can be enjoyable, the primary purpose isn't just relaxation.
* **D: Bojanala jwa ko ntle ga ntlo (Outdoor Tourism):**  Museums are indoor activities.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se ka tlang pele mo baeng ba tsa go iketla?","The correct answer is **A: Go itsenya mo setsong sa selegae (To immerse oneself in the local culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa ke fa batho ba etelang lefelo le le farologanyang le botshelo ba letsatsi le letsatsi go **iketla le go ikhutsa mowa**. ...Fa maikaelelo a moeti segolobogelo e le go etela lefelo lengwe go ka itse ka ditso le setso, mofuta o wa bojanala o itsege e le 'bojanala jwa setso'.""

This directly translates to people traveling to experience and connect with the **spirit/essence of a place**, and specifically mentions that **cultural tourism** is about visiting a place to learn about its **culture and traditions**.  ""Go itsenya mo setsong sa selegae"" best captures this idea of immersion in local culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ikhutsa mo ditirong tsa bona letsatsi le letsatsi (To escape from their daily routines)** - While travel *can* be an escape, the passage focuses on *experiencing something new*, not just getting away from the old.
* **C: Go bona matshwao a naga a a botlhokwa (To see important landmarks)** - Landmarks can be *part* of cultural tourism, but aren't the primary goal.
* **D: Go tlhaloganya hisitori ya lefelo (To appreciate the history of the place)** - History is important, but cultural tourism is broader than just history – it includes living traditions, customs, and ways of life.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that reflecting on past experiences (""boleng jwa tse di fetileng"") and the struggles and triumphs of those who came before (""ditiragalo tsa maitsholo a boiperekei"") helped people accept changes and new directives from the church. This directly points to the importance of understanding the congregation's history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go gopola moo go nnileng le katlego gone mo boitshwarong jwa kgwebo (Remembering where there was success in business practices)** - The passage doesn't mention business practices.
*   **B: Go nna le kitso ka batho ba ba nnileng le tlhotlheletso mo mokgatlhong (Having knowledge of people who were influential in the congregation)** - While knowing influential people might be helpful, the passage emphasizes understanding *events* and *experiences* from the past, not just individuals.
*   **C: Go itse gore ke eng se se tsweletsang mokgatlho (Knowing what strengthens the congregation)** - The passage does imply identifying strengths, but focuses on how past knowledge informs current understanding and acceptance of change.

The passage states: ""Dipolelo tse di ntseng jaana tsa katlego di fokoditse letshogo la diphetogo, ebile di tsetsekeletso ya go bona diphetogo mo nakong e e seng kgakala.""  This directly translates to ""These stories of success have lessened the shock of change and provided a framework for seeing changes in a broader context.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go thatafatsa boleng (To strengthen value):** While understanding history *can* reinforce values, the passage specifically links it to easing the transition of change.
* **C: Gore o kgone go nna mo mokgatlhong (To be able to be in the community):**  The passage discusses understanding *cultural* context, but doesn't explicitly say it helps one fit *into* the community.
* **D: Go tokafatsa mekgwa ya kgwebo (To improve business practices):** The passage focuses on cultural understanding and historical context, not business.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning isn't a one-size-fits-all process.** It states ""Ga go tsela epe e e nosi e e leng yone fela e e dirisiwang go ithuta"" (There is no single best way to learn).
* **It highlights the importance of experience and interaction with knowledge.**  ""Thutego e diragala mo maitemogelong gareng ga moithuti le kitso e e teng"" (Learning happens in the interactions between the learner and existing knowledge). This implies different experiences (maitemogelo) *contribute* to learning in different ways.
* **The examples given (watching TV, fixing a car, traveling) demonstrate how learning happens through diverse experiences.** Some are passive, some active, some practical.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ithuta go tshwanetse go tlhoma mogopolo mo dilong tse re dumelang gore re tlile go itemogela:** The passage doesn't talk about forming an opinion on things you’ve already learned.
* **C: Ditsela tse dingwe tsa go ithuta di botoka go nale tse dingwe:**  The passage doesn't suggest some ways of learning are *better* than others, just that they are different.
* **D: Ga gona ditsela tsa botlhokwa mo go ithuteng:** This directly contradicts the passage, which acknowledges that learning happens through various interactions and experiences.



"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a tlhalosang a a latelang e bontshang sentle ditsela tsa morago ga gompieno tsa go ithuta?,"The correct answer is **C: Maitemogelo a go ithuta a ikaegile ka moithuti le kitso e a e abetsweng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning happens through interactions between the learner and existing knowledge.** It states ""Thutego e diragala mo maitemogelong gareng ga moithuti le kitso e e teng"" (Learning happens in interactions between the learner and existing knowledge).  This directly supports the idea that learning is *situated* – meaning it's tied to the individual and the context of their knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go nale ditsela tse dintsi tsa go ithuta tshedimosetso (There are many ways to learn information):** While true, the passage *goes beyond* simply stating there are multiple ways. It focuses on *how* those ways are fundamentally based on interaction and personal experience.
* **B: Maitemogelo a mangwe a go ithuta a tshwanetse go beelwa kwa pele go nale a mangwe (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over others):** The passage doesn't discuss prioritization of learning experiences.
* **D: Kitso e re se kitlang re e dirisa le yone go santse go le botlhokwa go e ithuta (Knowledge we don't use is still important to learn):** The passage actually *illustrates* how often we gain knowledge without applying it, implying it might not be the most effective or meaningful kind of learning.  It points towards learning that is relevant and useful.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that deliberately waking up, then going back to sleep shortly after (like turning off an alarm and trying to fall back asleep) is a way to induce sleep paralysis.  This is because it disrupts normal sleep patterns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Reading the time doesn't directly relate to the described method of inducing sleep paralysis.
* **B:** Going to the bathroom and back to bed isn't mentioned as a technique.
* **D:** Drinking water doesn't align with the passage's description of intentionally manipulating sleep cycles. The passage *does* mention drinking fluids to encourage needing to urinate, but not as something done *after* waking up.

Ke efe ya tse di latelang e seng tlhaloso e e tshwanetseng ya go kgoreletsega ga boroko?,"The correct answer is **D: Morago ga go tsoga, mokgele ke go robala mo diureng tse pedi.**

Here's why:

The passage describes ""sleep inertia"" as waking up and feeling groggy for a short period (10-60 minutes).  Falling back asleep for *two hours* after waking is not consistent with the description of sleep inertia. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: E ka nna ka ntlha ya motsamao wa mmele** - The passage mentions using a vibrating alarm to gently wake you, representing a physical stimulus.
*   **B: Mokgele ke gore ke seka ka tsoga gotlhelele** - The passage explicitly states that the goal is to feel awake but not be fully roused.
*   **C: Tsamaiso e diragala nako ya fa o ntse o robetse** - The passage describes this happening *after* waking, but shortly returning to sleep.

"Fa boboko bo ntse bo leka go lora ka tsela e e utlwalang gantsi, ke eng se se oketsegang?","The correct answer is **D: Nako mogare ga maemo a REM** (Time between REM stages).

The passage states: ""Lebaka le le golo la tiragalo e, ke go re ditoro tsa motho a ipona di oketsa lebaka la nako e e fa gare ga diemo tsa go robala tse di bidiwang REM.""  This directly translates to ""The main reason for this is that a person's dreams increase the time between REM sleep stages.""

The question asks what increases when the body tries to ""catch up"" on sleep.  The passage clearly links the body's attempt to recover to *increasing the time between REM stages*.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Palo ya maemo a REM (Number of REM stages)** - The passage doesn't say the *number* of REM stages increases, but the *time between* them.
*   **B: Dikgato tsa maatla (Energy levels)** - While sleep impacts energy, the passage focuses specifically on REM stages.
*   **C: Boleele jwa boemo jwa go fola (Depth of restorative stage)** -  The passage doesn't discuss the depth of restorative sleep; it concentrates on REM sleep.

Ke dife tsa ditlamorago tse di sa siamang tse di latelang tse go lora o thantse gantsi go ka nnang le tsone mo mmeleng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go oketsega ga REM bosigo bongwe le bongwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that feeling tired increases the time spent in REM sleep stages. This means REM sleep *increases* when you're sleep-deprived.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says REM *increases*, not decreases.
* **B:**  Again, the passage states REM *increases* with tiredness, not decreases.
* **C:** While struggling to sleep is mentioned, the core issue discussed is the impact on REM sleep, not simply the act of trying to sleep.

"Go ya ka serapa, ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng le tse e seng tsa mmatota di tshwana jang?","The correct answer is **A: Go lebeletswe gore ditlhopha tseno ka bobedi di dire ka selekanyo se se tshwanang** (It is expected that both groups operate at a high level of expectations).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditlhopha tse di mo maranyaneng di tshwerwa ka seemo se se ko godimo sa ditsholofelo, fela jaaka ditlhopha tse di tlwaelesegileng...""  This directly translates to ""Groups in the matrix are held to a high level of expectations, just like traditional groups...""  This means both types of groups are expected to perform well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage highlights *differences* in autonomy, not similarities.
* **C:** The ""invisible group"" concept applies specifically to matrix teams, not traditional groups.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about both types of groups working in the same location at the same time.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a malebana le ditlhopha tsa mmatota le tse e seng tsa boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **C: Ditlhopha tse di tlwaelegileng ga di na taolo e e kalo go na le tse e seng tsa boammaruri.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gantsi ba nale boikemelanosi go gaisa ditlhopha tse di tlwaelesegileng, tse ka nako tse dintsi dika kopanang go ya ka dikgaolo tse di sa tlhalogangweng ke baokamedi jwa bone.""  This translates to: ""They generally have more autonomy than traditional groups, which often conform to rules not understood by their leaders.""  This directly implies that traditional groups have *less* control/understanding of their own rules compared to virtual/non-traditional groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states virtual teams are held to *high* expectations, similar to traditional teams – not that traditional teams have high expectations.
*   **B:** The passage suggests conflict between virtual teams and traditional teams, not that they frequently align.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention times benefiting non-traditional groups.



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang se se sa amaneng le dikgopolo tsa diteng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikeletso tse disha tse di diragalang fa motho a setse a godile** (Recommendations that happen after a person has already grown).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on *understanding what motivates people and what satisfies them*. It describes theories that try to explain the *roots* of motivation – what drives people from within and how their environment influences their actions. 

* **Options B, C, and D** all directly relate to the core ideas presented in the passage:
    * **B: Kafa tikologo ya motho e amang ditiro tsa gagwe ka teng** (How a person's environment affects their actions) - Directly mentioned as a focus of the theories.
    * **C: Ditlhokagalo tse di mo teng** (Inherent needs) -  The passage mentions people having ""dilo tse ba di eletsang"" (things they desire) and refers to theories like Maslow's that are *about* needs.
    * **D: Go tlhaloganya se batho ba se ratang** (Understanding what people like) - This is essentially what the theories aim to achieve – understanding what satisfies people.

* **Option A** deals with recommendations *after* growth. The theories discussed are about *why* people grow and develop in the first place, not about what happens *after* they've already grown.  It's about the underlying motivation, not the resulting advice or interventions.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa akarediweng mo molaong wa boraro?,"The correct answer is **A: Go dira motheo wa gore motho a ka nna a bewa kae** (To establish a basis for where a person can be placed).

Here's why:

The passage describes the ""rule of thirds"" in photography. It focuses on **composition** - how elements are arranged within the image to create visual balance and interest. 

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to the rule of thirds:

* **B: Go bopa botshelo le maatla mo setshwantshong** (To create life and power in the image) -  Good composition (like using the rule of thirds) *does* contribute to making an image more dynamic and engaging.
* **C: Go dira gore motho a nne mo lefelong le le rileng le le molemo** (To make a person be in a calm and good place) - The rule of thirds suggests placing subjects *off-center* at the intersections of the lines, often making the overall composition feel more balanced and therefore ""calm"" and visually pleasing.
* **D: Go tlhoma thulaganyo mo setshwantshong** (To create arrangement in the image) - This is the core of what the rule of thirds is about - organizing the elements within the frame.

However, the rule of thirds doesn’t specifically dictate *where* to place a person, only *how* to place them within the framework of the image for better composition.  It doesn’t establish a foundational rule for *location* within the scene itself.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng popego ya ditshwantsho tsa dimilimitara tse 35?,"The correct answer is **B: ""E ne ya dirisiwa ke dipopego tsa dikapaditshwantsho tsa maranyane a """"digital"""" ""**

Here's why:

The passage states that 35mm is *increasingly* accepted by digital camera formats, not that it was originally *for* them. It originated with analog film. The passage specifically highlights its history with film. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **A: E santse e dirwa** - The passage says ""E santse e tlhagisiwa le gompieno"" (It is still manufactured today).
*   **C: E na le selekanyo se se farologaneng le sa dipopego tse dingwe tse di tlwaelesegileng** - The passage details its dimensions (36mm x 24mm) and aspect ratio (3:2) showing it's a specific format.
*   **D: Ke poego e e tlwaelesegileng thata mo lefatsheng** - The passage states ""Ka sekai, sebopego se se tlwaelegileng thata sa go tsaya senepe se se emeng mo lefatsheng ke 33mm..."" (For example, a very common format for taking pictures in the world is 33mm...)

"Go ya ka serapa, fa baetsi ba dilense ba ntse ba tokafatsa boleng jwa dilense tsa bone, dilense tsa go atolosa dilo di tokafetse jang?","The correct answer is **C: Di kgona go tsaya ditshwantsho ka tsela e e tshwanang le ya dilense tse di nang le lobelo lo lo tlhomameng lwa go tlhoma lense**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dikapa-ditshwantsho tsa leitlho le le atologang go re di kgone go tsaya dinepe tsa boleng jo bo tshwanang le ja tsa leitlho le le sa atologeng."" This directly supports the idea that wide-angle lenses can capture images comparable to standard lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di na le lobelo lo lo kwa godimo lwa dilense** - The passage doesn't mention the speed (aperture) of the lenses.
*   **B: Go motlhofo go di dirisa fa maemo a lesedi a le kwa tlase** -  The passage actually says the opposite - wide-angle lenses *struggle* in low light without a flash.
*   **D: Di na le bo tlhoma leitlho jo bo kwa tlase go na le jwa dilense tse dikgolo** - The passage does mention low distortion as a benefit of these lenses, but this isn't the primary comparison being made to standard lenses regarding image quality.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke leng go ka nnang molemo go dirisa lense e e gogelang dilo kwa pele go na le dilense tse ditlwaelegileng?","The correct answer is **C: Fa o sa batle go dirisa folaše mo maemong a a lefifi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a drawback of magnifying lenses is their low aperture, making them difficult to use in low light *without* a flash. This implies that magnifying lenses are preferable when you want to avoid using a flash in dark conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa e le gore go botlhokwa thata gore o nne le phatlha e kgolo** - The passage mentions a wider field of view as a benefit, not necessarily a larger aperture.
*   **B: Fa e le gore o batla go dirisa dilense tse dinnye** - The size of the lens isn't discussed as a reason to choose a magnifying lens.
*   **D: Fa e le gore o batlana le lefelo le le raraaneng go feta** - While some lenses might offer a wider field of view, the passage focuses on the low-light performance and avoiding the need for a flash.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa tseweng e le e e tlhalosang sentle Masaitseweng?,"The correct answer is **D: Tsela e go gatelelwang thata ka yone gore motho a nne le maitemogelo a a tlhamaletseng e tshwana le mefuta e mengwe e mentsi ya bodumedi le kobamelo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tumelo ya Masaitseweng e ka farologanngwa le mefuteng e mengwe ya ditumelo tsa sedumedi le kobamelo ka e remeletse mo maitemogelo a namana a maemo a a kgethegileng a menagano...""  This means the *emphasis* on experiencing spiritual realities is *similar* to many other religions and spiritual practices.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Go gatelelwa thata go nna le kagiso le boitumelo mo mogopolong:** While kagiso (peace) and boitumelo (joy) are mentioned as potential results, the passage doesn’t say the *focus* is on *achieving* them. They are outcomes that some practitioners may experience.
* **B: Balatedi ba Masaitseweng ba batla go itse boammaaruri jwa semoya:** This is true, but it’s a broad statement. The passage focuses on *experiencing* spiritual reality, not just knowing about it intellectually.
* **C: Balatedi ba Masaitseweng ba ka nna ba dirisa mekgwa e e tla ba thusang go tlhaloganya dilo tsa bomodimo:** This is also true, but secondary to the core principle described in the text which is the emphasis on *having* the experiences themselves.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e seng karolo ya dithuto tsa Masaitseweng?","The correct answer is **B: Go batla kitso ka go dirisa maitemogelo a a kopanetsweng le a setšhaba.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes *inner* experience and a personal connection with the divine (""maitemogelo ka tlhamalalo, tlhobaelo, kgotsa kitso ya boammaruri ja bomodimo/modimo wa medimo""). It speaks of seeking understanding through *individual* insight. 

Option B, seeking knowledge through publicly shared or conventional experiences (""maitemogelo a a kopanetsweng le a setšhaba""), is contrary to this focus on personal, internal spiritual exploration. Masaitseweng focuses on *individual* revelations and experiences, not collective or societal ones.

Let's look at why the other options *are* aligned with the passage:

*   **A: Go senka go lemoga boammaaruri jwa bomodimo** - This aligns with seeking ""kitso ya boammaruri ja bomodimo"".
*   **C: Go gatelela boemo jo bo itumedisang jwa mogopolo** - The passage mentions those who have “kagiso, kitso, boitumelo” – states of mind.
*   **D: Go batla go itse Modimo ka botlalo** - This directly relates to the desire to understand ""Modimo.""



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o ka tswang a simolotse setšhaba sa temothuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ba-Maori ba ba tswang kwa Polynesia**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *original* belief was that the Maori arrived from Polynesia and then developed a farming system. While the passage later clarifies the relationship between Maori and Moriori, it initially identifies the Polynesians (Maori) as the ones who began farming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriori wa kwa New Zealand:** The text says Moriori *separated* from the Maori and went to the Chatham Islands. They didn't start the farming system.
*   **B: Moriori yo o tswang kwa Ditlhaketlhakeng tsa Chatham:**  They developed a *different* culture, but didn't *start* the farming system.
*   **D: Ba-Maori ba ba tswang kwa nageng:** This is too vague. The text specifies they came from *Polynesia*.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, setlhopha se se neng se tsoma di-moas e ne e le baagi ba ntlha ba lefelo lefe?","The correct answer is **A: Naga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...go ne go dumelwa fa baagi ba ntlha ba **naga** ya New Zealand e ne e le morafe wa ba Maori, o o neng o tsoma dinonyane tse dikgolo..."" 

This directly translates to ""...it was believed that the first inhabitants of the **land** of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted large birds...""



"
Ke mo seemong sefe se go dirisa mokgwa wa Pureland wa go dira di-origami go ka solegelang yo o menang molemo?,"The correct answer is **A: Foldara e rata go menola dilo di le dintsi ka nako e le nngwe** (The folder likes to fold many things at once).

Here's why:

The passage states that the origami method ""Origami ya Pureland"" is designed to allow folding multiple layers of paper at the same time, and that all folds should be made in the correct place. This directly relates to someone who prefers to fold many things at once.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Foldara eno e na le bokgoni jo bo kwa godimo jwa go kgweetsa** (This folder has a high level of precision) - While precision is important in origami, the passage doesn’t emphasize this as the *benefit* of this specific method.
* **C: Foldara e dira origami e e tlhokang go menwa go tswa kwa morago** (The folder makes origami that doesn’t need to be folded from the back) - The passage doesn’t mention anything about avoiding folding from the back.
* **D: Foldara e e lekile gangwe kgotsa gabedi pele ga foo** (The folder has tried once or twice before the gift) -  This is irrelevant to the method itself and the passage's description of its function.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhalosang sentle origami ya Pureland?,"The correct answer is **D: Ke mokgwa o o molemo mo difoldareng tse di nang le bokgoni jo bo lekanyeditsweng jwa go kgweetsa** (It is a good method for folders with limited dexterity).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that origami ya Pureland was *designed to help those who had difficulty learning,* including the elderly. This suggests it’s for people *without* high dexterity – the opposite of what option D claims.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: E diretswe dipampiri tse di mennweng gantsi.** (It is made with folded papers.) – The passage states ""Origami ya Pureland e na le go re ga go letlelesege go mena pampiri makgetho a feta bongwe ka nako..."" (Origami ya Pureland involves easily folding a few sheets of paper at a time...)
*   **B: Mokgwa ono ga o akaretse go menoga go go sa siamang** (This method does not involve incorrect folding) – The passage states ""ga mmogo le banalebogole"" (including the elderly) and was made for easier learning.
*   **C: Memeno e tshwanetse go nna e tlhamaletse mo mafelong** (The fold should be aligned in places) - The passage states ""memeno yotlhe e tshwanetse go nna fa go tlhamaletseng teng"" (all the folds should be in the correct place).



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke lefelo lefe le le sa amaneng le Setso sa Mokgatšha wa Indus?","The correct answer is **C: Dikarolo tsotlhe tsa bokonebotlhaba jwa Afghanistan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Indus Valley Civilization extended into *some* parts of north-eastern Afghanistan. However, it doesn't say it encompassed *all* parts. The other options are directly linked to the civilization:

*   **A: Harappa** – This is the site after which the civilization is sometimes named (Harappan Civilization).
*   **B: Noka ya Sarasvati** – The passage discusses debate about whether the civilization also flourished along this river.
*   **D: Bontsi jwa Pakistan ya segompieno** – The civilization covered much of modern-day Pakistan.

Therefore, the only option not directly associated with the Indus Valley Civilization, as described in the text, is all parts of north-eastern Afghanistan."
Ke efe ya maina a a latelang e e sa umakiweng e le leina le le ka tswang le dirisitswe go bitsa Bronze Age e go buiwang ka yone mo serapeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Setšhaba sa Ba-Harappan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the civilization is sometimes called the ""Harappan civilization"" *after* Harappa, the first site excavated. It also mentions ""Indus-Sarasvati civilization"" and refers to it as the ""Indus civilization.""  ""Setšhaba sa Noka ya Indus"" and ""Setšhaba sa Mokgatšha wa Indus"" are reasonable paraphrases of names used in the text. However, ""Setšhaba sa Ba-Harappan"" isn't mentioned as a formal name for the civilization in the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tla re solegelang molemo mo isagweng?","The correct answer is **A: Ba dirisane mmogo le ba bangwe.**

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""...fa nako e ntse e ya go re ba dirisane mmogo le ba bangwe."" (as time goes on, people will realize it will benefit them to work with others). This directly aligns with the question asking what will benefit us in the future.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go baya dilo tse motho a di kgatlhegelang kwa pele (Putting personal interests first):** The passage suggests the *opposite* – that prioritizing collaboration will be beneficial.
* **C: Go gatelela gore ke eng se se tla solegelang ba le mmalwa molemo go feta bontsi (Insisting what benefits a few is better than the many):** This contradicts the passage's focus on collective benefit.
* **D: Go lemoga bopelotshetlha go ka nna molemo (Recognizing selfishness can be beneficial):**  Again, the passage emphasizes cooperation, not selfishness.



"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se motho a ka se bayang kwa pele fa a batla maduo a a bogadi bo gaufi?","The correct answer is **B: Go Dirisana Mmogo (Cooperation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people will realize it will be to their benefit to cooperate with others as time goes on. It implies that initially people are acting in self-interest (""bogagapa"" - selfishness), but will eventually understand the value of working together.  The passage suggests cooperation will lead to more positive outcomes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go sa nne pelotshetlha (Not being impatient):** While patience might be a virtue, the passage doesn't specifically mention it as a key factor.
*   **C: Tirisanommogo (Collaboration):** While related to cooperation, ""go dirisana mmogo"" is the direct phrase used in the passage.
*   **D: Bogagapa (Selfishness):** The passage suggests moving *away* from selfishness, not embracing it.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a duelela karolo e kgolo ya ditshenyegelo tsa ntwa?","The correct answer is **B: Dibanka tsa Wall Street**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...merokotso ya ditheko tsa matlo tse di neng di le mo maroding a puso ya Philippine go dirisiwa dibanka tsa Wall Street."" This directly indicates that Wall Street banks were used to handle a large portion of the war debts.  The passage continues to state that these debts contributed significantly to the wealth of Americans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puso ya Philippines:** The passage states the debts *were used from* the Philippine government's funds, not that the Philippine government was paying the debts.
*   **C: Puso ya bokolone ya United States:** While the US colonial government benefitted, the passage specifically points to the banks as the entities handling the debts.
*   **D: Batho ba Philippines:** The passage states that the debts impacted the Filipino people negatively but doesn't say they were responsible for paying them.



"
Ke nako efe e e neng ya tla pele ga motlha wa Ba-Templar?,"The correct answer is **C: Tshimologo ya Metlha ya Bogare** (The beginning of the Early Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states the Templars existed during the ""High Middle Ages"" (AD 1000-1300). It then clarifies this period was *preceded* by the ""Early Middle Ages"". Therefore, the time *before* the rise of the Templars would be the beginning of the Early Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bofelo jwa Metlha ya Bogare** (The end of the Early Middle Ages) - This is too late, as the High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages.
* **B: Lekgolo la bo12 la dingwaga** (The 12th century) - This falls *within* the High Middle Ages, not before it.
* **D: Lekgolo la bo13 la dingwaga** (The 13th century) -  Also falls *within* the High Middle Ages.



"
Ke nako efe e e neng ya latela motlha wa Ba-Templar?,"The correct answer is **C: Bogodimo jwa Metlha ya Bogare** (High Middle Ages).

The passage explicitly states that the time period the Templars existed in was called the ""High Middle Ages"" ( *Bogodimo jwa Metlha ya Bogare* in Setswana).  Therefore, this is the time period that followed their origin.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bofelo jwa Metlha ya Bogare** (End of the Middle Ages) - This comes *after* the High Middle Ages.
* **B: Lekgolo la bo12 la dingwaga** (12th Century) - While the Templars were active *during* the 12th century, it's a specific century *within* the broader High Middle Ages, not the period that followed their founding.
* **D: Lekgolo la bo11 la dingwaga** (11th Century) - This is the period *before* and at the beginning of the High Middle Ages, closer to when they were founded, not following.



"
Ke kalafi efe kgotsa karo e go sa umakiweng gore e ne e dirisiwa ke dingaka le dingaka tse di arang mo motlheng wa Mmusomogolo wa Roma?,"The correct answer is **C: Go thibela go elela ga madi ka di-clamp tsa ditshika**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...go kganela ditshika go thibela kelelo ya madi."" This directly aligns with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions using drugs, it doesn’t specify treating shock with them.
*   **B:** The passage *mentions* scopolamine was *derived* from a plant, but doesn't say that making it was a common practice for doctors.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention treating gangrene.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa amaneng le kgatelopele e e neng ya dirwa mo go tsa kalafi ka nako ya Mmusomogolo wa Roma?","The correct answer is **B: Leano le le bogale la sesole la Mmusomogolo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses entirely on the development of medicine and surgical practices in ancient Rome.** It discusses Augustus starting to recruit doctors, the formation of medical corps, the knowledge of different drugs, and surgical techniques.
* **Option A (Go tlhomiwa ga Setlhopha sa Kalafi - The formation of a medical corps) is directly mentioned in the text.**
* **Option C (Go tlhomiwa ga dikokelo tsa go ithutela bongaka - The establishment of medical training schools) is implied.** The passage says doctors had knowledge of various drugs, suggesting some form of education or passing down of knowledge.
* **Option D (Go thapiwa ga dingaka ke Mmusimogolo - The recruitment of doctors by the emperor) is explicitly stated in the first sentence.**
* **There is absolutely no mention of any military plan or strategy within the passage.**  The text is solely about medical advancements.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that doesn't relate to the advancements in medicine during the Roman Empire as described in the passage.



"
Bokgoni jwa go bona bo ikaegile ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikarolo tsa mmele tse di dirang gore motho a bone** (The body parts that allow someone to see).

**Here's why:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Pono, kgotsa bokgoni jwa go bona bo ikaegile ka **dikarolo tsa mmele tse di thusang go bona** kgotsa matlho."" (Vision, or the ability to see, is dependent on **body parts that help to see** or eyes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditlhokego tsa setshedi** (Needs of the environment) - While the environment influences *what* we see, it doesn't explain *how* we see.
* **C: Go nna le maikutlo a a rileng ka botelele jwa marang** (Having strong feelings about the depth of space) - This is irrelevant to the biological process of vision.
* **D: Maemo a a farologaneng a go nna bogale** (Different states of being awake) -  Being awake is necessary to see, but doesn't *explain* the ability to see.



"
Go farologana ga popego ya leitlho ga ditshedi go ikaegile ka eng?,"The passage discusses how eyes are built with many layers of different densities, each with different abilities to receive and process light. It doesn't mention anything about differences in eye structure *between sexes*. Therefore, none of the options provided are supported by the text. 

However, if forced to choose the *least incorrect* answer based on general knowledge, **B: Ditlhokego tsa setshedi (Needs of the sex)** is the most plausible. While the passage doesn’t say this, it’s a known fact that visual needs can differ slightly between sexes due to evolutionary pressures (e.g., color perception for foraging vs. identifying potential mates).

**Important Note:** This is a *guess* based on outside knowledge, as the passage itself doesn't provide the answer.  The best answer would be ""None of the above,"" if that were an option.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a malebana le Sikh a a sa tlhalosang bodumedi jono sentle?","The correct answer is **A: Bo-Sikh bo simologile ka go kgaogana ga makoko mo dingwaong tsa Bahindu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Sikhism *originated from a breakaway sect within Hinduism*. While it acknowledges a connection to Hinduism, saying it ""originated from a breakaway sect"" doesn't fully represent the depth and distinct nature of the Sikh faith as explained in the paragraph. It frames it solely as a reaction *to* Hinduism, rather than a unique path with its own principles (Gurmat) and evolving teachings through the Gurus.

Let's look at why the other options are good representations of the text:

*   **B: Boruti ke karolo e e botlhokwa ya Ba-Sikh:** The text explicitly states that ""Borutisi jwa sedumedi ke karolo ya botlhokwa thata mo ditumelong tsotlhe tsa Se-India mme go ya ka bo-Sikhik bo tsere karolo ya botlhokwa e e bopang dithuto tsa bodumedi tsa konokono tsa ma-Sikh.""
*   **C: Go ne go na le baruti ba le robongwe ba ba neng ba latela mosimolodi wa bodumedi jono e bong Guru Nanak:** The passage mentions Guru Nanak being followed by nine other Gurus.
*   **D: Dingwao dingwe tsa Sikh di simologile mo Bohindu:** The passage says that Sikhs view their faith as distinct from Hinduism, *yet* based upon it and its traditions.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tsewang e le karolo ya konokono ya tumelo ya Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Kgopolo ya gore go na le moruti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Borutisi jwa sedumedi ke karolo ya botlhokwa thata mo ditumelong tsotlhe tsa Se-India mme go ya ka bo-Sikhik bo tsere karolo ya botlhokwa e e bopang dithuto tsa bodumedi tsa konokono tsa ma-Sikh."" (The concept of a guru is a very important part of all Indian religions, and according to Sikhism, it holds a key role in forming the foundational religious teachings of the Sikhs.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dingwao tsa Sehindu:** While the text says Sikhism is related to Hinduism and its traditions, it doesn't identify Hindu rituals as a *core* part of the faith.
*   **C: Go gana go amogela madumedi a mangwe a Ma-India:** The text doesn't mention rejecting other Indian religions. It speaks of being distinct from, but rooted in, Hinduism.
*   **D: Go bua Se-Punjabi:** While the text mentions ""se-Punjab"", it doesn’t say speaking the language is core to the *belief* system of Sikhism, but rather that the term ""Gurmat"" is in the Punjabi language.

"Go ya ka serapa, bana ba ba sa kgoneng go tlhoma mogopolo ba ka nna ba thatafalelwa ke go tlhoma mogopolo mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Tiro ya sekolo** (School work).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bana ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa ADD ba na le bothata jwa go dira tiro ya sekolo..."" (Children with ADD have difficulty doing school work...).  It specifically links difficulty with focusing (a component of ADD) to struggles with schoolwork.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tshameka metshameko** (Playing sports): The passage actually states children with ADD *can* do things they enjoy, like sports, easily.
* **C: Go lebelela metshameko ya ditshwantsho** (Watching cartoons): Similar to sports, this is an example of something they *can* focus on.
* **D: Dilo tse ba ratang go di dira** (Things they like to do):  The passage explicitly says they excel at things they enjoy.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa bana ba ba sa kgoneng go tlhoma mogopolo ba rata go dira dilo tse di kotsi?","The correct answer is **D: Go tlhotlheletsa boboko jwa bone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...gore ba tsose boboko ka gore maboko a bone ga a tsosiwe ke dilo tsa tlwaelesego."" This directly translates to ""that they raise a fuss because their hands are not stimulated by usual things.""  This implies they seek stimulation, and if not found in appropriate ways, can lead to disruptive or ""dangerous"" behaviors (as implied by the question).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go fokotsa go sa dire dilo ka tsela e e feteletseng** - The passage mentions hyperactivity, but doesn't link it to seeking dangerous activities.
*   **B: Go ba thusa gore ba nne le kamano le balekane ba bone** - The passage states ADD *affects* relationships, not that risky behavior is a way to improve them.
*   **C: Gore batsadi ba bone ba ba ele tlhoko** - While attention is important for children with ADD, the passage doesn’t say risky behavior is a way to get it.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke efe mo go tseno e e seng sekai sa go thusa ngwana go ithuta?","The correct answer is **C: Thulaganyo e e ikemetseng ya go ithuta (Independent learning arrangement)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""scaffolding"" as *assistance* given to students learning something new. It’s about support structures that help them through a challenging task.  An *independent* learning arrangement, by definition, lacks that supportive structure.  The student is expected to learn on their own, without the temporary guidance scaffolding provides.

Let’s look at why the other options are likely scaffolding:

*   **A: Thuto ya go simolola motshameko wa khomputara (Learning to start a computer program)** - Starting a new computer program is a new skill; instruction and help getting started *is* scaffolding.
*   **B: Motlhatlheledi wa SAT (SAT tutor)** - An SAT tutor provides guidance and support to improve skills – scaffolding.
*   **D: Motlhatlheledi yo monnye wa setlhopha (Small group instructor)** – An instructor in a small group provides support and direction – scaffolding.



"
"""Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a sa tlhaloseng sentle kgopolo ya """"scaffold"""" (go thusa ngwana go ithuta)?""","The correct answer is **C: Gape go itsege jaaka go ithuta go go ikaegileng ka porojeke.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that scaffolding is *more* than project-based learning.** It says ""Le fa thuto e e ikaegileng ka diporojeke e tshwanetse ya dira gore go ithuta go nne motlhofo e bile go kgatlhe, skafole se dira sengwe se se fetang seo."" (Even project-based learning should make learning engaging, scaffolding does something *more* than that.)  Therefore, equating scaffolding *to* project-based learning is inaccurate.

Let's look at why the other options are good descriptions of scaffolding, based on the text:

* **A: Go thusa ngwana go ithuta go ka nna teng ka tsela ya mmatota** - The entire passage is about how scaffolding *supports* a learner.
* **B: Ke thuso go na le mokgwa wa go ithuta** - Scaffolding *is* a form of assistance in the learning process.
* **D: Di-scaffold di dirisiwa go thusa fa go simololwa go ithuta** - The text specifically mentions scaffolding is helpful when starting new things (""go ithuta go dirisa sebalamakgolo kgotsa ba simolola porojeke e ntsha"" - learning to use a calculator or starting a new project).



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya MySpace e e ka thusang baithuti ba ba nang le bothata jwa go bala?","The correct answer is **C: Aterese e le nngwe ya Inthanete** (Single web address).

Here's why:

The paragraph specifically states that the simple web address makes it easier for students who struggle with typing or spelling. It simplifies access for those who have difficulty with traditional methods of accessing information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Thulaganyo e e diretsweng wena (Personalized layout):** While a customizable layout is mentioned, the text doesn't link it to helping students with reading difficulties.
*   **B: Di-blog (Blogs):** Blogs are just one *part* of what MySpace offers, and the passage doesn't highlight them as helpful for reading.
*   **D: Difaele di le dimilione di le 54 (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is a statistic about the site's popularity, not a feature helping with reading.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e se karolo ya karabo ya ga Khrushchev mo dikhuduegong tsa badiri?","The correct answer is **C: Go fokotsa dituelo**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states the strikes in Poland were *against* increased taxes (""go fokodiwa ga dituelo""). It doesn't say Khrushchev responded by *reducing* taxes. In fact, it suggests the strikes were partially *because* of the taxes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlhomiwa ga Tonakgolo e ntšha (Appointing a new Prime Minister)** - The passage explicitly states Khrushchev agreed to install Władysław Gomułka as the new prime minister.
*   **B: Go dirisa ditanka go busetsa thulaganyo (Using tanks to restore order)** - The passage mentions Khrushchev sent troops to restore order.
*   **D: Go lemoga gore go na le dilo dingwe tse o tlhokang go di dira ka madi (Acknowledging some things needed to be done differently)** - The passage says Khrushchev ""believed some of the things they wanted to improve"" indicating he was willing to compromise.



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e neng e sa bake dikhuduego kwa Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Go tlhomiwa ga Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the strikes *evolved* into a general anti-communist uprising.  It then says Khrushchev ultimately agreed to appoint Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister. This appointment was a *result* of the uprising, not a cause of it.  The other options (Communism, food shortages, and reduced taxes) are explicitly listed as reasons *for* the strikes/uprising.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e neng e sa ame dikamano tsa USSR le USA?","The correct answer is **A: Dipharologano tsa setso**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that differences in **systems, beliefs, and values** (which are closely related to culture) led to a breakdown in international harmony after WWII.  It also mentions disagreements over **Germany** (B) and differences in **ideologies** (C - ""dithulaganyo tsa go farologanya"" translates to differences in ideology).  Finally, it touches on **alliances** (D - ""dikgotlhang tse di amanang le dithulaganyo"").

However, the passage *doesn't* mention cultural differences as a direct cause of the tensions between the USSR and USA.  The focus is on political and ideological clashes.

Therefore, **dipharologano tsa setso** (cultural differences) is the element *not* directly cited as impacting the relationship between the USSR and USA in the given text.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng sentle boikaelelo jwa go romela matshwao a ditshika mo mmeleng otlhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Go dira gore mmele o nne o ritibetse**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the nervous system's role is to keep fluids flowing properly and prevent buildup.**  The options A, B and D all relate to this fluid regulation and protection.
* **Option C, ""To make the body rigid,"" is not mentioned at all in the passage and doesn't align with the function of the nervous system as described.**  In fact, a healthy nervous system contributes to *coordination* and movement, not rigidity.

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to the passage:

* **A: Go fokotsa kelelo ya madi (To reduce fluid pressure):** The passage mentions preventing fluid buildup, which would lower pressure.
* **B: Go laola kelelo ya madi (To regulate fluid pressure):**  Maintaining proper flow *is* regulation.
* **D: Go tila dikotsi tsa mmele tse di ka nnang tsa direga (To prevent physical injuries that might occur):** The passage explains that nerve signals help protect organs during trauma.



"
Ke eng se se ka fitlhelwang kwa Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikgakgamatso Tsotlhe Tse Supa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Giza Plateau (or ""Mabitla a Giza"") contains ""diphiramiti di le mmalwa (tse mo go tsone ”Phiramiti e Kgolo” e le e kgolo go gaisa), mabitla a mannye a le mmalwa, ditempele di le mmalwa, le sefikantswe sa ”The Great Sphinx”"".  This means all of those things can be found there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mabitla** - While there *are* mabitla (tombs) there, it's not the only thing.
*   **B: Ditempele** - Again, temples are present, but not the whole story.
*   **D: Phiramiti e Kgolo** - The Great Pyramid is a part of the complex, but the plateau contains more than just that one structure.



"
Boikaelelo jwa Phiramiti e Kgolo e ne e le bofe?,"The correct answer is **B: Go tlotla Faro**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Phiramiti e Kgolo e ne e agetswe go tlotla Faro Khufu, mme bontsi jwa diphiramiti tse dinnye, mabitla, le ditempele di ne di agetswe go tlotla basadi ba ga Khufu le balosika."" This directly translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go nna sengwe sa dikgakgamatso tse supa tsa lefatshe** - While it *is* a wonder of the world, that's a result of its construction, not its *purpose*.
*   **C: Go nna lefelo la botlhokwa** - It was important, but the text specifies *why* it was important – to honor the Pharaoh.
*   **D: Go boloka mabitla a batho ba ba tlhokafetseng** - While there were tombs at Giza, the primary purpose of the Great Pyramid itself was not to store the remains of ordinary people. It was specifically for the Pharaoh.



"
Ke mang yo o ikarabelelang ka go bo re itse motho yo o neng a fisa tempele?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Ephesians tried to erase Herostratus's name from records because they were angry with him. However, **Strabo**, a Greek historian, later wrote about the name, which is how we know it today. While Herostratus *committed* the act, Strabo is the reason we *know* who did it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baefeso (Ephesians):** They wanted to *erase* the name, not reveal it.
*   **B: Alexander yo Mogolo (Alexander the Great):** He offered to rebuild the temple, but didn't reveal the arsonist's identity.
*   **D: Artemis:** Artemis was the goddess the temple was dedicated to - she wasn't responsible for its destruction."
Ke polelo efe e e boammaaruri malebana le go agiwa seša ga tempele ya ga Aretemise?,"The correct answer is **B: E ne ya agiwa sesha morago ga puso ya ga Alexander yo Mogolo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Moragonyana, ga gore Alexander a tlhokafale, tempele e ile ya agiwa sesha kwa ngwaga ya 323 BCE."" This clearly means the rebuilding happened *after* Alexander's death (in 323 BCE).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says Alexander *offered* to rebuild, but it's stated that his offer wasn't actually carried out.
*   **C:** Herostratus was the *destroyer* of the temple, not involved in rebuilding it.
*   **D:** The passage states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke leng mofuta mongwe wa ditshedi o neng wa simolola go tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi?","The correct answer is **A: Dingwaga di le dimilione di le supa tse di fetileng** (Millions of years ago).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mme le gale gongwe di-Sahelanthropus, tsone di ka tswa di ne di tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi mo e ka nang a dingwaga tse di dimilione tse supa tse di fitileng.""  This translates to ""And perhaps even Sahelanthropus, they may have walked on two legs maybe millions of years ago.""

The other options refer to the timeframe for *Australopithecus*, not the potentially earlier *Sahelanthropus*.



"
Ke mofuta ofe wa ditshedi tseno o ka metlha o neng o tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mme le gale gongwe di-Sahelanthropus, tsone di ka tswa di ne di tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi mo e ka nang a dingwaga tse di dimilione tse supa tse di fitileng.""  This directly indicates that *Sahelanthropus* *might* have been the earliest to walk on two legs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Homo erectus:** The passage says they *started* walking upright later, after Australopithecus.
*   **C: Dikarolo tse pedi tsa maoto (Two legs):** This describes *how* they walked, not *which* species.
*   **D: Australopithecus:** The passage states they developed walking upright *after* potentially Sahelanthropus.



"
Ke eng se sesole sa lewatle sa Jeremane se neng se leka go se fitlhelela ka nako ya Ntwa ya Lefatshe ya WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Go thibela Borithane go amogela batho le dithoto**.

Here's why:

The passage states the German navy (using U-boats) tried to *stop* the movement of people and supplies to Britain by America. This directly translates to preventing Britain from *receiving* people and goods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tshwara dithoto tse di tswang kwa Borithane:** The passage doesn’t say they were trying to *capture* supplies from Britain, but to stop them from reaching Britain in the first place.
*   **C: Go tsamaisa dilo go kgabaganya Atlantic:** The German navy was trying to *disrupt* movement, not facilitate it.
*   **D: Go thibela Amerika go amogela batho le dithoto:** While the U-boats targeted ships coming from America, the ultimate goal was to harm Britain's ability to fight, not directly stop America from sending aid.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng, ke mang yo o neng a atlega thata mo ntweng ya sesole sa lewatle ka nako ya Letsholo la Bokone jwa Atlantic?","The correct answer is **B: Majeremane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka nako e, sesole sa lewatle sa Jeremane, se dirisa thata dikepe tsa U-boats, se ne se leka go emisa metsamao e."" This directly indicates that the German navy was actively and forcefully attempting to disrupt Allied shipping, implying they were successful in the naval warfare during the Battle of the Atlantic. While the Americans were *trying* to transport goods, the passage highlights the Germans' efforts to *stop* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maesemane le Maamerika:** The passage focuses on the Germans attempting to stop the Americans (and by extension, the Allies including the British). The Americans were on the defensive, trying to *get* supplies through.
*   **C: Majeremane le Maesemane:** While both sides were involved, the passage emphasizes the German success in disrupting the Allied efforts.
*   **D: Maesemane:** This is incorrect, as the passage states the *German* navy was the one actively trying to control the seas.



"
Ke eng se se neng se seyo fa Maaasiria ba ne ba simolola go dirisa bapalami ba dipitse?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditlhagwana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo e ka nnang ka 1000 B.C., ma-Asiria a ne a simolodisa sesole sa ntlha sa dipitse.""  ""Dipitse"" translates to ""horses"" in English, and therefore, the Assyrians began using **cavalry** (soldiers on horseback).  ""Ditlhagwana"" is the Setswana word for horses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dithunya** - means ""shields""
*   **C: Dikara** - means ""carts"" or ""wagons""
*   **D: Diaparo tsa ntwa** - means ""armor"" or ""clothing for war""



"
Dintwa tse go dirisiwang kalvari mo go tsone di lowa jang?,"The correct answer is **C: Go palama pitse**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Calvary ke masole a lwanelang mo morago ga pitse."" This translates to ""Calvary is soldiers fighting *on* horses."" Therefore, cavalry warfare involves riding horses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mo dinaong** (In formations) - While formations are used in warfare, it doesn't define *how* cavalry fights.
*   **B: Go se na diaparo tsa ntwa** (No war clothes) - This isn't related to cavalry tactics.
*   **D: Ka masole a mannye** (With few soldiers) - Cavalry could be used in large or small numbers. It doesn't define the method.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke kae koo o neng o ka se ka wa fitlhela moagi yo o tlwaelegileng wa Babelona gone?","The correct answer is **D: Go tlisetsa ditlhabelo kwa lefelong le le boitshepo la mo teng**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Tempele nngwe le nngwe e na le lolwapa lo lo bulegileng, le phaphusi e e boitshepo e e ka fa teng, e e tsenwa ke baruti fela. Ko godimo ga ditora e ne e le lefelo le le kgethegileng, la medimo."" This means only priests could access the most sacred area - the spot dedicated to the gods. An ordinary citizen wouldn't be allowed there, but would participate by bringing offerings to the open courtyard (lolwapa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlisiwa ga ditlhabelo mo lolwapeng lwa tempele:** This is where *everyone* participated.
*   **B: Go nna gone mo moletlong kwa tempeleng ya konokono:** The passage doesn't mention specific ceremonies that would exclude citizens.
*   **C: Kwa moletlong mongwe mo lolwapeng lwa tempele:** Similar to B, this doesn't imply restricted access."
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang tse di neng di diretswe baperesiti ka tlhamalalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mekete**.

The passage states: ""fa baruti bone ba ne ba leka go tlamela ditlhoko tsa medimo ka **mekete** le meletlo"". This directly links ceremonies (mekete) to the actions of the priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mafelo a a boitshepo a mo teng:** While priests *used* these holy places (the sanctuaries within the temples), they didn't *perform* them.
* **C: Mekete:** This is a duplicate of A and therefore not a different answer.
* **D: Di-ziggurat:**  Ziggurats were built *as* part of the temples, but the priests didn't perform the ziggurats themselves. They used them.



"
Kgosi Tutankhamun o ne a tuma leng?,"The correct answer is **C: Morago ga go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe** (After the discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe ka ngwaga wa 1922 go mo dirile go re e nne motho yo o itsegeng thata."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a very famous person.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Morago ga go utswiwa ga lebitla la gagwe** - While related to the tomb, ""utswiwa"" means being robbed. The passage says his tomb *wasn't* robbed like others.
* **B: Ka nako ya puso ya gagwe** - The passage states he wasn't very well-known *during* his reign.
* **D: Ga a rekotiwa mo bontsing jwa manaane a dikgosi tsa bogologolo** - This states he *wasn't* famous, the opposite of what the question asks.



"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Kgosi Tutankhamun e nne kgosi e e itsegeng thata ya Egepeto?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ribololwa ga lebitla la gagwe** (The discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""go utololwa ga lebitla la gagwe ka ngwaga wa 1922 go mo dirile go re e nne motho yo o itsegeng thata."" (the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a very famous person).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states he *wasn't* well known in ancient times and wasn't included in many lists of ancient kings.
*   **C:** While the discovery *did* yield many artifacts, the passage says the discovery *made* him famous, not the artifacts themselves.
*   **D:** The passage states he wasn't considered very important in ancient times.



"
Mmoki wa Mogerika e bong Homer o ne a sa kgone go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Bona**.

The passage states that Homer was ""mogaka wa mmoki wa sefofu"" which translates to ""the author of a blind bard"" or ""a blind poet."" This means Homer himself was blind.
"
Ke Mogerika ofe yo o tumileng yo o itsegeng ka sengwe kwa ntle ga  dibuka?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

The passage states Pythagoras was a mathematician known for his theorem about the relationship between the sides of right triangles. This is a field *outside* of literature (books).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sophocles:** The passage identifies him as a playwright (a book/script writer).
*   **B: Homer:** The passage identifies him as the author of epic poems (books).
*   **D: Aristophanes:**  The passage identifies him as a playwright (a book/script writer).



"
Lelapa la Bahebera le ne le fetsa nako e ntsi ya lone kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwa ntle**.

The passage states: ""Bontsi jwa botshelo jwa malapa a ma-Hebero bo ne bo le **kwa ntle**."" (Much of the life of Hebrew families was **outside**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mo mmileng** - While shops faced the street, the passage doesn't say families *spent their time* there.
* **C: Mo jarateng** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Mo ntlong** - The passage explicitly states the house wasn't considered important, implying they weren't spending a lot of time inside.



"
Ke eng se se neng se se botlhokwa thata mo lelapeng la Bahebera?,"The correct answer is **C: Legae la bone** (Their home).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Bontsi jwa botshelo jwa malapa a ma-Hebero bo ne bo le kwa ntle"" (Much of the life of Hebrew families was outside). And also describes the simple nature of their homes (""ntlo e ne e se botlhokwa thata"" - the house was not very important). This indicates their life revolved around the home and family within it, despite its simplicity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlelaemete ya bone** (Their wealth) - The passage mentions high prices for grain, suggesting limited wealth, and doesn't emphasize wealth as central to their lives.
*   **B: Mabenkele a bone** (Their shops) - The passage says shops were just open counters facing the street, meaning they weren't significant.
*   **D: Go apaya ga bone** (Their cooking) - While cooking is mentioned, it's just a detail about daily life and not the *most* important thing.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa tlhalosiweng e le pharologano fa gare ga dinaga tsa Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefatshe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Le fa lefatshe lengwe le lengwe le ne le le ”Scandinavian” ne go na le dipharologanyo tse dintsi gareng ga batho, dikgosi, mekgwa le ditiragalo tsa bogologolo tsa mafatshe a Denmark, Sweden, Norway le Iceland."" 

This means that while these countries are all Scandinavian, they differ in their **people (batho), rulers (dikgosi), customs (mekgwa), and historical events (ditiragalo tsa bogologolo)**. The passage doesn't mention the geography (lefatshe) as being a source of difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hisitori** - The passage specifically mentions differing historical events.
*   **C: Ditheo tsa setso** -  ""Customs"" (mekgwa) are mentioned as a point of difference, representing cultural practices.
*   **D: Batho** - The passage clearly states differences among the people of these countries.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a nna kwa Greenland pele?,"The correct answer is **A: Merafe ya Maeskimo** (Eskimo people).

The text explicitly states: ""Go sa kgathelesege go re o fitlheletse eng, merafe ya ma-Eskimo e ne e setse e tshela mo lefelong leo."" This translates to: ""Regardless of what he discovered, Eskimo tribes were already living in that area.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Manorway:** While Erik the Red was Norse, the text doesn't say Norse people were the first inhabitants.
*   **C: Erik yo Mohibidu:** Erik the Red *discovered* the land for the Norse, but didn't live there first.
*   **D: Masweden:** The text discusses Scandinavian countries broadly, but doesn't state Swedes were the first in Greenland.



"
Ke setlhopha sefe se se ka ratang go ja dijo tsa maitseboa se sena ditulo?,"The correct answer is **B: Banna ba ba humanegileng ba Roma** (Roman married men).

Here's why:

The text states: "" *fa batho ba ba dikobo di dikhutshwane le basadi ba ja dijo ba ntse mo ditilong, bahumi ba ne ba rata go ja dijo tse di farologaneng mmogo mo ba neng ba sekama ka letlhakore fa ba ntse ba ja dijo tsa bone.*""  This translates to: ""while both slaves and women ate while reclining, husbands liked to eat a variety of foods together while reclining on their sides while eating their food."" This indicates that *married men* specifically enjoyed elaborate dining and variety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Basadi ba ba humileng ba Roma (Roman free women):** While women ate while reclining, the text emphasizes the husbands’ enjoyment of varied food.
*   **C: Banna ba ba humileng ba kwa Roma (Roman free men):** The text specifies *married* men (""bahumi"").
*   **D: Basadi ba ba humanegileng ba Roma (Roman married women):**  Again, the text focuses on the husbands’ preferences.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e neng e se karolo ya moletlo wa Baroma ba Bogologolo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sejana sa kalakuni e e besitsweng** (A portion of pumpkin that has been sweetened).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...ga gona Baroma bape ba bogologolo ba ba kileng ba utlwa monate wa kalakungwa.""  This translates to ""there were no ancient Romans who had ever tasted pumpkin.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baeng ba ba humanegileng ba ja mo ditulong** (Slaves eating in the dining room) - The passage mentions slaves and women eating alongside their owners.
*   **B: Sejo sa pele sa dikgopa** (A portion of dormice) - Dormice are listed as one of the unusual delicacies of Roman feasts.
*   **C: Banna ba ba humileng ba rapame fa ba ja** (Rich men reclining while eating) -  The passage states that wealthy Romans liked to eat a variety of foods while reclining on couches.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se kang ya nna le diphelelo tse di nnelang ruri?","The correct answer is **B: Setso se sennye (Small culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dingwao tse di nyennyane gantsi di nyelela di sa tlogele sepe kwa morago, se se dira gore di seka tsa tsewa jaaka merafe e e feletseng.""  This translates to ""Small cultures often disappear without a trace, which makes it so they cannot be remembered as complete civilizations.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Setšhaba (Nation/People)** – The passage *defines* civilization as relating to a large group of people living and reproducing together as a community.
*   **C: Motse wa naga (Rural settlement)** – While settlements are *part* of a civilization, the passage implies civilizations are larger and more complex than just a rural settlement.
*   **D: Setso sa tlhabologo (Civilized culture)** – The passage explains what a civilized culture *is* and its key characteristic of knowledge transfer across generations, implying lasting impact.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se tlang pele ga setšhaba?","The correct answer is **C: Toropo kgolo e gape e leng lefatshe ka bo yone**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metsemegolo e tsile pele ga dichaba."" which translates to ""Cities came before nations.""  A ""toropo kgolo"" (large city) is the closest equivalent to a city in this context, and the text implies it predates the formation of nations/tribes (""dichaba"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Setso se se tlhabologileng** - The text states that civilized culture involves the *transmission* of knowledge, not that it *precedes* nations.
*   **B: Setso se se sa tlwaelegang** - The text doesn't mention anything about uncivilized culture coming before nations.
*   **D: Ngwao tse dinnyennyane.Ditso tse dinnye** - The text mentions these as being left behind and not forming complete cultures, so they aren't what came *before* nations.

Ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a tlhama kago ya phemelo  go keteka phenyo ya masole a Ba-Tibetan le Ba-Mongol**.

Here's why:

The passage *states* that Zhabdrug Ngawang Namgyel *built* the dzong (kago ya phemelo) to commemorate his victory over Tibetan-Mongol forces. The option incorrectly states he ""fought"" the forces.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: E kwa Bhutan** - The passage clearly states it's located in the Paro Valley of Bhutan.
*   **C: Molelo o ne wa senya masalela a mantsi a kago ya phemelo** - The passage says a fire destroyed much of Drukgyal Dzong.
*   **D: E tlhamilwe ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The passage states Zhabdrug Ngawang Namgyel built the dzong.



"
Ke polelo efe e e tlhalosang sentle se se neng sa direga morago ga molelo kwa Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **C: Go tuma ga lefelo leno ga go a amega**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Morago ga molelo, kago eno ya phemelo e ne ya baakanngwa le go sirelediwa, mme ya nna yone fela e e setseng ya mafelo a a ngokang kgatlhego a kwa Bhutan."" This means that even after the fire, the ruins of Drukgyal Dzong *remained* a popular attraction. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Selo se le sengwe fela se se neng se setse e ne e le setshwantsho sa ga Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** - The text mentions portraits survived, but doesn't say *only* the portraits remained. The ruins themselves remained.
*   **B: Masole a Ba-Tibetan le Ba-Mongol a ne a fenya** - The text says Zhabdrug Ngawang Namgyel defeated them in 1649, before the fire.
*   **D: E ne ya bolokwa ke Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the dzong, he didn't preserve it *after* the fire. The text says it was ""baakanngwa le go sirelediwa"" (maintained and protected) *after* the fire.



"
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri ka Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: Ba-Thai ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa mo lekgolong la bo-18 la dingwaga mme ka 1772 ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba-Vietnam ba ne ba senya Phnom Phen:** The passage says Vietnam *attacked* Cambodia, but doesn't say they destroyed Phnom Phen.
*   **B: Cambodia e ne ya tlhasela Thailand ka 1772:** The passage states Thailand attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
*   **C: Cambodia e ne ya tlhaselwa ke Ba-Vietnam kwa tshimologong ya lekgolo la bo18 la dingwaga:** While Vietnam did attack, the passage mentions these attacks were in the *late* 1700s, not the early 1700s."
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e tlhalosang sentle go tlhaselwa ga Cambodia?","The correct answer is **D: Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlo a le mmalwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states, ""Ba-Thai ba ne ba tlhasela Cambodia makgetlho a le mmalwa mo lekgolong la bo-18 la dingwaga"". This directly supports option D.
*   While the passage mentions Vietnamese attacks, it doesn't emphasize *multiple* attacks like it does for the Thai.
*   Option B is incorrect because both Thailand and Vietnam attacked, not just in 1772.
*   Option C is incorrect because the passage states Phnom Penh was destroyed by the Thai, not the Vietnamese.
*   Option A only mentions the Vietnamese, ignoring the Thai attacks which were more frequently stated.

Therefore, option D is the best and most accurate summary of the Cambodia attacks as described in the passage."
Ke efe yakhamphani tsa Ma-Dutch a ko Botlhaba jwa India e ne ya se ka ya dira eng fa e ne e le kwa Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **C: Go thapa badiri ba Machina mo masimong a yone** (To hire Chinese laborers in its fields).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...e simolodisa phetogo mekgwa ya tlhagiso dikuno tsa ditlhaka tse di tlholegang koo le go hira badiri ba ma-China go bereka mo masimong a re ise le sukiri."" ( ...initiated changes in agricultural methods for local crops and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the fields, including sugar cane).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the Dutch East India Company *did* establish a foothold in southwestern Taiwan, the passage doesn't say they *owned* the land.
*   **B:** They initiated changes in *agricultural methods* for existing crops, but the passage doesn't say they specifically began growing tobacco.
*   **D:** They did eventually lose control to the Qing dynasty, but this was not something they *did* intentionally. They were overtaken by Qing forces.



"
Tumalano ya Shimonoseki e ne ya tlhomamisa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Taolo ya Japane mo Taiwan** (Japan's control of Taiwan).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1895, ba fetsa go fengwa mo ntweng ya Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), goromete wa Qing o ne wa saenela Treaty of Shimonoseki, e e neng e fa Japan taolo ya kgaolo ya Taiwan."" This directly explains that the Treaty of Shimonoseki resulted in Japan gaining control of Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go fenngwa ga Japane mo Ntweng ya Ntlha ya China le Japane** – The treaty was a result of the *Chinese* defeat, not Japanese.
*   **B: Boemo jwa Taiwan jaaka porofense ka nako ya puso ya bogosi jwa ga Qing** – This was established *before* the treaty, in 1885.
*   **C: Bokgoni jwa Taiwan jwa go laola gape mafelo a yone a a mo lotshitshing** – The treaty took power *away* from Taiwan/China, it didn't return it.



"
pH ya khemikale e lekanngwa jang?,"The correct answer is **C: Palo ya di-ion tsa haeterojene mo khemikaleng** (The number of hydrogen ions in the chemical).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Selekanyo sa pH se bontshiwa ke selekanyo sa diayone tsa Hydrogen (H mo go pH) mo khemikaleng e go dirilweng diteko mo go yone.""  This directly translates to ""The pH measurement is shown by the measurement of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khemikhale e o na le beisi le asiti e kana kang** (Whether the chemical has acid and base) - While pH *relates* to acids and bases, it's not *defined* by simply having both present.  It's a *quantification* of acidity or alkalinity.
* **B: Go na le diprotone tse kae mo khemikaleng** (How many protons are in the chemical) - Protons are part of hydrogen ions, but pH measures *free* hydrogen ions, not all protons in the chemical.
* **D: Go na le dieleketerone tse kae mo khemikaleng** (How many electrons are in the chemical) -  Electrons are important for ion formation, but pH specifically focuses on hydrogen ions.



"
Go ne ga ntshiwa eng mo di-ioneng tsa haeterojene?,"The correct answer is **A: Diprotone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diayone tsa Hydrogen ke di-proton tse di kgaogantsweng le di-electron tsa tsone..."" This directly translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that are bound to their electrons...""  Therefore, hydrogen ions *are* protons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH** - pH is a *measurement* related to hydrogen ions, but not what is removed *from* them.
* **C: Alkalaene** -  An alkaline substance affects pH, but isn't removed from hydrogen ions.
* **D: Di-eleketerone** - While hydrogen ions have electrons, the passage specifies protons are the key component being described when referring to hydrogen ions.
"
Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a sa tlhalosang setlhopha sa ditau sentle?,"The correct answer is **D: Di a bolaya e bile di dirisana le batho**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes tau as behaving like foxes or weasels, and being wary of other animals. It does *not* mention any aggression towards humans or other killing behaviour.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the text:

*   **A: Di itshwara fela jaaka motlhape wa dintša** - The text explicitly states ""segopa sa ditau se itshwara fela jaaka sa diphiri kgotsa dintswa"" (tau behaviour is like that of foxes or weasels).
*   **B: Palo ya banna le basadi ga e lekane** - The passage says groups can have ""tau e tona e le nngwe go ya ko go tse tharo"" (one to three males) and ""namagadi di ka nna masome a mararo le bana ba tsone"" (dozens of females and their young). This clearly indicates a male-to-female ratio that isn't equal.
*   **C: Ditona le namagadi tsotlhe di amana thata** - The text states the group consists of a male/males and many females and their young, implying a close-knit family structure.



"
Ke dipolelo dife mo go tse di latelang tse di sa tlhalosang sentle tsela e ditau di itshwarang ka yone?,"The correct answer is **A: Di rata batho thata**.

Here's why:

The passage states ditau are wary (borai) of other animals. This implies they are *not* fond of humans. The other options are all directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Boitshwaro jwa tsone bo tshwana le jwa diphiri** - The passage explicitly states their behaviour is like that of foxes or weasels.
*   **C: Tse ditonanyana le tse di namagadi di kotsi thata mo diphologolong tse dingwe** - The text says they live in groups (diboka) of males and females and the females, along with their young, form a strong family unit of hunters and gatherers.
*   **D: Boitshwaro jwa bone bo tshwana le jwa dikatse tse dingwe tse dikgolo** - The passage says they behave like foxes or weasels, which are similar animals to the tau (but not large cats).



"
Ke mofuta ofe wa sebatana se gantsi se bolayang mebutla?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikatse tse dinnye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kwa bofelong, go na le dikatse tse dinnye di le dintsi (go akaretsa dikatse tse di ruiwang tse di sa bofiwang) tse di jang ditshedinyana tse dinnye tse dintsi tse di jaaka ditshenekegi, dipeba, mekgatitswane, le dinonyane.""  This directly implies that smaller cats prey on smaller animals like mice (ditshenekegi), spiders (dipeba), and small birds (dinonyane) – which includes creatures like voles (mebutla).

The passage specifically contrasts these smaller cats with the larger/medium-sized cats that prey on larger animals.
"
Dikatse tse dinnye gantsi di tsoma eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshenekegi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dikatse tse dinnye di le dintsi... tse di jang ditshedinyana tse dinnye tse dintsi tse di jaaka **ditshenekegi**, dipeba, mekgatitswane, le dinonyane."" 

This directly indicates that *ditshenekegi* are among the things small cats eat.
"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e seng karolo ya mokgwa wa go tsoma wa ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: Di sala diphologolo tsa bone morago bosigo** (They leave their prey behind overnight).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Di-ocelot di tsoma ka go iphitlha mo lefelong, *mme di bo di tlolela diphologolo tse di di tsomanang*."" This translates to ""Ocelots hunt by ambushing in the area, *but they also leave their prey overnight*."" This directly contradicts the idea that they *don't* leave prey behind.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Di iphitlha mo tikologong tsa tsone** (They ambush in their environment) - The passage says ""Di-ocelot di tsoma ka go iphitlha mo lefelong...""
* **B: Di latela monko wa se ba se tsomang** (They follow the scent of what they hunt) - The passage says ""...dikatse tsa nageng di latela le go bona diphologolo tse di ka di jang (se di se tsomang) ka go latela monko wa tsone...""
* **D: Di tsoma fela diphologolo tse dinnye** (They only hunt small animals) - The passage states ""Phologolo e e bidiwang ocelot e rata go ja diphologolo tse di nnye."" (The animal called an ocelot likes to eat small animals.)



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa tlhaloseng sentle gore sebatana sa lengau le go tweng ocelot ke eng? ,"The correct answer is **C: Go dupa ga tsone go bokoa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Baitsesaense ba akanya go re dikatse tsa nageng di latela le go bona diphologolo tse di ka di jang (se di se tsomang) ka go latela monko wa tsone, **di dupa fa di neng di le teng fa fatshe.**"" This means they *mark* where they have been, not that their scent is blocked.

Let's look at why the other options *are* good descriptions of ocelots, based on the text:

* **A: Di kgona go tsoma sentle bosigo** - The text says ""Di kgona go bona fela sentle mo lefifing"" (They can see well at night).
* **B: Di tsamaya ka tidimalo** - The text states ""Di tsamaya gape ka tidimalo"" (They also move quietly).
* **D: Di rata go tsoma diphologolo tse dinnye** - The text says ""e rata go ja diphologolo tse di nnye"" (it likes to eat small animals).



Therefore, option C is the only one that *doesn't* accurately describe something about ocelots according to the provided text."
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se tseweng e le nonofo e kgolo ya nkwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Go rora (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mefuta eno ya dikatse key one fela e e kgonang go rora."" (This type of cat is the only one capable of roaring).  It then clarifies that the roar is unique, unlike a full lion's roar, but more like a growl.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go palama (Climbing):** The passage says it *can* climb, but doesn't highlight it as a defining characteristic or a ""major trait.""
* **C: Go tlolaka (Hunting):** Hunting is common to many cats, not unique to this one.
* **D: Go goga (Strength):** Strength is mentioned, but it's described in terms of how it hunts, not as a core trait itself.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se dirang gore go nne le pharologanyo fa gare ga ditau le dipitse?","The correct answer is **A: Bokgoni jwa tsone jwa go thuma** (Their ability to roar).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Mefuta eno ya dikatse key one fela e e kgonang go rora."" (This type of cat is the only one capable of roaring.) and then contrasts the roar of a leopard with that of a lion. This highlights roaring as a key distinction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Modumo wa go kurutla ga tsone** (Their purring sound): The passage doesn't discuss purring.
* **C: Tsela e ba tlolelang ka yone** (The way they climb): While leopards are good climbers, the passage focuses on roaring as the defining difference.
* **D: Maatla a bone a go gogela** (Their swimming ability): The passage mentions swimming, but not as a differentiating factor between leopards and other big cats.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, Robert Hooke o ne a dira eng pele ga baithutatshelo ba bangwe?","The correct answer is **A: Ela tlhoko disele tse di suleng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E ne e le motho wa ntlha go lekola disele tse di suleng."" (He was the first person to observe dead cells). This directly answers the question of what Robert Hooke did *first* compared to other scientists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dirisa maekorosekopo go bona setshedi:** While true, the passage doesn't say he was the *first* to use a microscope to see a cell.
* **C: Ela tlhoko dikwere tse dinnye:** He observed small compartments, but the key point is he observed *cells* specifically.
* **D: Bona dikarolo tse dinnye tsa setshedi:** He saw the small parts *within* cells, but his initial discovery was observing the cells themselves.



"
"""Lefoko """"sele"""" le tswa kae?""","The correct answer is **B: Phaposi e nnye**.

The passage states: ""Lefoko sele le tswa mo lefokong la Selatine la """"cella"""" le le kayang phaposi e nnye."" which translates to ""The word cell comes from the Latin word """"cella"""" which means a small room."" 

Therefore, the origin of the word ""sele"" (cell) is a small room/compartment - a phaposi e nnye.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, bontsi jwa diphologolo di kgona go dira eng?","The correct answer is **B: Tsamaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bontsi jwa diphologolo di kgona go **tsamaya**."" (Most animals are able to **move/walk**.)

While the passage *also* mentions other forms of movement (thuma - swim, fofa - fly, epa - creep), it specifically says *most* animals can **tsamaya** (walk/move).



"
"Go ya ka serapa, diphologolo dingwe ga di na eng?","The correct answer is **C: Boboko**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Diphologolo ke tsone fela tse di nang le boboko (le fa tota e se diphologolo tsotlhe; ka sekai, jellyfish, yone ga e na boboko).""  This translates to: ""Animals are the only ones that have bones (even though not all animals; for example, a jellyfish, it does not have bones).""

This directly indicates that *some* animals do *not* have bones, using the jellyfish as an example. The other options are all things the passage states animals *do* have.



"
Ke dimela dife tse di thusang mo thulaganyong ya fotosentesese?,"The correct answer is **A: Moriti** (Trees).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dimela di itirela dijo go tswa mo letsatsing ka thulaganyo ya photosynthesis."" (Plants make their own food from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis.)  And further states ""Gape di re direla moriti."" (They also provide us with trees.)
* **Photosynthesis happens *in* plants, particularly in their leaves.** Trees are plants.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Diphologolo (Animals):**  Animals *benefit* from photosynthesis (they eat plants), but they don't *do* photosynthesis.
    * **C: Dijo (Food):** Food is a *result* of photosynthesis, not the thing that performs it.
    * **D: Letsatsi (Sun):** Sunlight is *needed* for photosynthesis, but it isn't the organism performing the process.



"
Ke eng se batho ba se hemang se dimela di se hemang?,"The correct answer is **B: Okosejene**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dimela di dira okesejene e batho ba e hemang..."" which translates to ""Plants produce oxygen that people breathe..."" 

Therefore, plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dijo (Food)** - While plants *are* a source of food, the passage specifically says plants *produce* something that people breathe.
*   **C: Metsi (Water)** - Plants need water, but don't produce it for people to breathe.
*   **D: Carbon dioxide** - Plants use carbon dioxide, they don't produce it for people.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke sekai sefe mo go tse di latelang se se ka kgoreletsang thulaganyo ya go iphetogela ga ditshedi ka botsone go nna tse dingwe?","The correct answer is **A: Setlhopha se sennye se se palelwang ke go atlega mo lefelong le lentshwa** (A small group that is isolated and succeeds in a new environment).

Here's why:

* **The passage explains speciation as happening when a small group gets separated and faces different pressures in a new environment.** This forces them to adapt, and over time, become different enough to be considered a new species.  Option A directly reflects this scenario – isolation *and* success in the new environment are key.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Karolo ya batho e e fudugelang kwa lefelong le leša** (A portion of people moving to a new area) - While migration can *start* the process, it doesn't guarantee isolation or the necessary selective pressures for speciation. They might still interbreed with the original population.
* **C: Palo ya batho e e tlwaelang tikologo e ntšha** (The number of people adapting to a new environment) - Adaptation is part of the process, but doesn’t automatically lead to a new species. Adaptation can happen *within* a species.
* **D: Kgabagare batho ba nna babedi** (Eventually people become two) -  This is a result of speciation, not a cause of it. It describes the outcome, not the process.



"
Ke dipolelo dife mo go tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng sentle gore ditshedi di iphetogela go nna tse dingwe? ,"The correct answer is **A: Go direga fa setlhopha se sesha sa batho se sa kgone go fetoga** (It happening when a new group of people cannot change).

Here's why:

* **Speciation** is *about* change and adaptation. The passage explains how a group, separated from its original population, *needs* to adapt to a new environment. If a group *cannot* change, it won't lead to the formation of a new species – it will likely perish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ke thulaganyo e e botlhokwa ya kgolo le phetogo ya ditshedi go nna tse dingwe** (It is an important arrangement for the growth and change of species to become others) - This *is* a correct statement *about* speciation, but it doesn't describe something that hinders the process.
* **C: Go kaya go bopiwa ga mofuta o mosha wa ditshedi** (It means the formation of a new species) - This *defines* speciation, it doesn't explain a failure in the process.
* **D: Ga go kake ga tilwa gore go tla direga** (It cannot be doubted that it will happen) - This is a statement of certainty, not a factor preventing speciation.



"
Ke karolo efe ya thulaganyo ya madi e e isang madi kwa pelong?,"The correct answer is **D: Ditshika**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""Madi a tswa mo pelong ka ditshika tse di bidiwang diatheri a bo a boela mo pelong ka dipeipe tse di bidiwang diveini.""  This translates to: ""Blood leaves the heart through vessels called arteries and returns to the heart through pipes called veins.""

The question (Q) asks which part of the circulatory system brings blood *to* the heart.  The text explicitly states that blood *returns* to the heart through **diveini (veins)**, which are the ""dipeipe"" or pipes. However, the options provided do not include ""diveini"", and the text also refers to ""diatheri"" (arteries) as vessels *from* the heart. Since the question asks about bringing blood *to* the heart, the closest answer available is **ditshika (veins)** as these are the vessels through which blood travels *back* to the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mesifa (Muscles):** Muscles help pump blood, but aren't the vessels themselves.
*   **B: Dikhaphilari (Capillaries):** Capillaries are tiny vessels where exchange of oxygen and nutrients happens, not the main pathways *to* the heart.
*   **C: Ditokololo (Lymph nodes):** Lymph nodes are part of the immune system, not the circulatory system.



"
Ke ditšhupu dife tse dinnye mo thulaganyong ya madi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshikana**.

The passage (P) specifically states: ""Dipeipi tse dinnye di bidiwa ditshikana"" (Small pipes are called capillaries). 

Therefore, capillaries are the small structures in the circulatory system."
Bokgoni jwa tshenekegi jwa go mena diphuka tsa yone bo oketsa eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Phepelo ya dijo (Food supply)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to fold wings helps insects ""easily pursue prey and find food"".  Therefore, the ability to fold wings *increases* their food supply.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mafelonyana a le mantsi a di ka tshabelang dibatana mo go one (More veins they can navigate through)** - While the passage mentions veins, it doesn't say folding wings *increases* the number of veins.
* **C: Go batla ditsala (Finding friends)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about finding friends.
* **D: Lobelo lwa sefofane (Aircraft speed)** - The passage focuses on maneuverability and finding food, not speed.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa umakiweng mo serapeng e le sengwe se se amang bokgoni jwa tshenekegi jwa go fofa?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsala** (To reproduce).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how insects' ability to fly helps them with *survival* - finding food and shelter.  Let's break down why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **B: Botshelo jotlhe** (Entire life) - The passage implies flight is important throughout an insect’s life, helping with both finding food and shelter.
* **C: Go kokoanya dijo** (Gathering food) - The passage *directly* states flight helps with finding food.
* **D: Go lekana** (Matching/Fitness) -  The passage implies better flight leads to better chances of survival (fitness).

However, *reproduction* (go tsala) is **not** mentioned as a benefit or factor related to flight ability in the provided text.



"
Ke mokgwa ofe mo go e e latelang e gantsi e sa amaneng le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **B: Diphofa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that people *disagree* with classifying these creatures as dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly.  This highlights the fact that feathers and flight are generally **not** associated with dinosaurs, even though we now know some dinosaurs *did* have feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tsamaya ka leoto le le kwa morago:** The text says they walk on two legs like a T-Rex, which *is* a dinosaur characteristic.
*   **C: Go beela mae:**  Dinosaurs laid eggs, so this *is* consistent with them being dinosaurs.
*   **D: Maoto a a nang le manala:** The text says they have claws, which is also a dinosaur characteristic.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e gantsi e sa tseweng e tshwana le dinonyane le di-dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: Go beela mae**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that both birds and dinosaurs ""baya mae"" (lay eggs). This is a key similarity highlighted in the text. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate as the *most* significant shared characteristic mentioned:

*   **B: Go tsamaya ka maoto a mabedi a kwa morago:** While mentioned, the passage specifically connects this to T-Rex, a specific dinosaur, not *all* dinosaurs.
*   **C: Go kgona go fofa:** The passage states people *disagree* birds are dinosaurs because of their ability to fly. It’s a point of contention, not a shared trait.
*   **D: Maoto a a nang le manala:** The passage states they have claws, which is part of having feet with nails but doesn’t emphasize nails specifically as a strong connection.

Therefore, laying eggs is the most prominent and directly stated similarity between birds and dinosaurs in the provided text."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya semela sa cycad e Di-Triceratop e ka nnang ya e ja?","The correct answer is **A: Mathare a a motswi**.

The passage specifically states: ""Triceratops e ka tswa a ne e dirisa molomo wa yone o o thata go tlhobola **mathare mo sethareng** pele e ja thito."" (Triceratops might have used its strong beak to break the **tough leaves** before eating the stem). 

Therefore, the passage indicates Triceratops would eat the *mathare* (leaves) of the cycad plant."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng mo go tse di latelang se Di-Triceratop e ka se jang? ","The correct answer is **B: Semela se se nang le dikala tse di thata** (Plants with tough branches).

Here's why:

The passage states that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are described as ""plants with tough branches and stiff leaves."" While the passage also mentions debate about tough plants, it ultimately suggests Triceratops *could* have eaten them by using its strong beak to break them down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sloth** - The passage does not mention sloths.
*   **C: Papalagae** - The passage does not mention Papalagae.
*   **D: Semela se se nang le maungo a a botlhole** - The passage actually presents this as a point of contention – some scientists believe plants *too* tough with pits wouldn’t have been eaten by dinosaurs.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke mofuta efe ya metshameko e e latelang e e ka tswang o ratiwa thata kwa dikgaolong tse di kwa bokone jwa Italy?","The correct answer is **C: Go palama snowboard**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Metshameko ya mariga e tumile thata mo dikgaolong tsa Bokone,"" which translates to ""Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions."" Snowboarding is a winter sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kgwele ya Dinao (Football/Soccer):** While popular nationally, the passage specifically links *winter* sports to the northern regions.
*   **B: Motshameko wa volleyball (Volleyball):** The passage doesn't mention volleyball specifically.
*   **D: F1 dikoloi tsa lobelo (Formula 1 racing):** The passage mentions Formula 1, but doesn't associate it with the northern regions."
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng eno, ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko e e latelang o o neng wa dira gore Italy e nne mmampodi wa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Kgwele ya Dinao**.

The passage states: ""Setlhopha sa bosechaba sa kgwele ya dinao sa Italy... ke ditlhopha tsa bobedi tse di atlegileng thata mo lefatsheng mme e ne e bafenyi ba Sejana sa Lefatshe sa FIFA ka ngwaga wa 2006."" This means the Italian national football (soccer) team won the FIFA World Cup in 2006, making it a world champion."
Ke tiragalo efe e e neng ya dira gore dikarolo dingwe tsa Luxembourg e nne tsa Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium**.

The passage states: ""Dikarolo tsa segompieno tsa Belgium e ne e le karolo ya Luxembourg mo nakong e e fetileng mme ya nna karolo ya Belgium morago ga Phetogo ya kwa Belgium ya bo-1830."" This directly links the current Belgian territories that were once part of Luxembourg to the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
"
Ke maemo afe a a latelang a a neng a ama boitlhaodi jwa Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Go nniwa ke Jeremane** (Being occupied by Germany).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Luxembourg was aligned with Germany during both World War I and World War II. This occupation directly impacted its sovereignty and history.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **B: Go tsena mo Lekgotleng la Ditšhaba Tse di Kopaneng tsa Yuropa** (Joining the European Union) - While significant, this happened *after* a long history of Luxembourg seeking self-determination, it didn't initially affect its sovereignty, but rather participated in a new collective sovereignty.
*   **C: Diphetogo Tsa Kwa Belgium** (Belgian Revolution) - This *resulted* in Luxembourg losing territory to Belgium, but it wasn't the primary factor influencing its struggle for independence.
*   **D: Go nna naga e e ikemetseng** (Being an independent nation) - This is the *goal* of Luxembourg's history, not an event that *affected* its sovereignty in the way occupation did.



"
Ke dikilometara di le kae tsa sekwere tsa naga ya Turkey tse di mo Yuropa?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""...disekwere khilomithara di le 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) di leng kwa Yuropa."" This directly answers the question."
"Go ya ka serapa, Turkey e boleele jwa dikilometara di le kae?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Tshimo ya kwa Turkey e bogolo jo bo fetang dikhilomithara di le 1,600 (dimaele di le 1,000) ka boleele..."" This directly answers the question."
Puo ya Selatine e dirisiwa jang kwa Toropong ya Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Mekete ya bodumedi** (Religious ceremonies).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Selatine ga ntsi se dirisiwa mo medirong ya tsa tumelo"" which translates to ""Latin is not often used in matters of faith"". This implies that Latin is primarily used in religious ceremonies, not daily conversations, law, or official communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Puisano ya letsatsi le letsatsi** (Daily conversation) - The text states Italian is used for everyday life.
*   **C: Molao** (Law) - No mention of Latin being used for law.
*   **D: Molaetsa wa semmuso** (Official messages) - Italian is used for official communication.



"
"Kwa Toropong ya Vatican, Setadiana ga se dirisiwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **B: Molaetsa wa semmuso (Official communication)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Selatine ga ntsi se dirisiwa mo medirong ya tsa tumelo."" This translates to ""Latin is not much used in religious ceremonies."" It *also* states that Italian is used in official communication and legal affairs. This implies that Setadiana (Italian) *is* used for official communication, but Selatine (Latin) is used less and less in religious events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Molao (Law):** The passage states Italian is used in ""legal affairs.""
*   **C: Mekete ya bodumedi (Religious ceremonies):** Latin *was* traditionally used, but the passage says it's used less now.
*   **D: Puisano ya letsatsi le letsatsi (Daily conversation):** Italian is used by many residents for daily conversation.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke melemo efe e e latelang ya go kopanya modumo mo dikhomputareng tse di raraaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Mmino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mmino ga ntsi o gatisiwa ka dikhomputara tse di tlhatlhameng go tsamaisa le go tswakanya medumo mmogo."" (Music is increasingly created using computers to manipulate and synchronize sounds.)

The question asks about the benefit of combining sound *in* computers. The passage directly links computers to music creation and manipulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ditshwantsho tse di takilweng (Captured images):** The passage mentions computers *changing* images, not specifically capturing them.
* **C: Ditshwantsho (Images):** While images are mentioned, the focus isn't on the benefit of combining them with computers, but rather on computers altering them.
* **D: Go aga (Building):** This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, bontsi jwa matlo a a mo lefelong lefe a ne a na le matlwana a boithomelo a a tlhatswang metsi?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ditoropo tsa Harappa le **Mohenjo-daro** di ne di na le matlwanaboithomelo a a gogiwang mo e ka nnang mo ntlong nngwe le nngwe..."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets that were flushed in almost every house...).

The other options are mentioned as having toilets, but not with the same level of prevalence (""in almost every house"").
"
Ke mafelo afe mo go a a latelang a a neng a na le dithulaganyo tse di tlhabologileng tsa go tsamaisa leswe?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ditoropo tsa Harappa le Mohenjo-daro di ne di na le matlwanaboithomelo a a gogiwang mo e ka nnang mo ntlong nngwe le nngwe, a a golagantsweng le thulaganyo e e raraaneng ya kgeleloleswe.""  This means Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had sophisticated plumbing systems connected to almost every house.

While the passage mentions plumbing in Santorini, Egypt, and China, it doesn't say their systems were particularly *developed* or *integrated* like those in Harappa.  It states they *had* them, not that they were advanced.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e dirang gore motshameki a retologe?,"The correct answer is **B: Matlhakore a mabedi go bapa le legare la sekete**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that the curvature of the net (legare) causes the ball (phatlha) to spin, and as it spins, the side touching the net *curves*. This curvature is what makes the player chasing the ball move from side to side – they have to follow the curve.  The description specifically highlights the ""matlhakore a mabedi"" (two sides) in relation to the net causing this effect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokgoko o monnye o o mo tlase ga legare la sekate:**  While a small mesh might exist, the passage doesn't connect it to the player's movement.
* **C: Seemo sa bokgoni jwa motshameki:** The player's skill isn't the *cause* of the movement, but rather they *respond* to the movement caused by the net.
* **D: Boleng jwa aese:** The quality of the court isn't mentioned as a factor in the ball's spin or the player's movement.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a tlhalosang sentle phatlha e e mo letlhakoreng la seketswana sa gompieno?","The correct answer is **D: E sekame**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the sides of the narrow gap (the ""phatlha fa gare ga one"") *bend* or *curve* and *slip* as the person moves through it. This bending and slipping is what causes the person to rotate.  ""E sekame"" (it bends/curves/slips) directly reflects this characteristic of the gap's sides.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E na le matlhakore a mabedi** (It has two sides) - While true, this is a very basic description and doesn't explain the *function* of the gap within the passage.
*   **B: Go kobega** (To bend) - While related to the slipping action, ""go kobega"" doesn't quite capture the dynamic nature of the sides *giving way* as the person moves.
*   **C: Sephara** (Gap) - This just restates what it is, not *how* it behaves.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke thulaganyo efe e e dirang gore diatomo di kgone go ntsha maatla a a feteletseng mo leseding?","The correct answer is **B: Go ntshiwa ga difothone go go tlhotlheletsang** (The emission of photons).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that atoms release tiny particles called ""photons"" to get rid of excess energy they've absorbed from light. This process of releasing photons *is* how they shed the excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maatla a marang** (Energy of rays) - While the passage discusses energy, it doesn't say this *is* the mechanism. It's what the atoms *have* but need to get rid of.
* **C: Fothone** (Photon) - A photon is *what* is released, not the *process* of releasing it.
* **D: Go ntshiwa ga marang** (Release of rays) - The passage specifically clarifies that light *is* a type of ray, and the atoms are releasing photons, not rays themselves.  The process is described as ""go ntshiwa ga marang a a fetlhilweng"" (emission of excited rays) which leads to the release of a photon.



"
Ke eng se se dirang gore atomo e ntshe fotone?,"The correct answer is **B: Tlhotlheletso e e bakwang ke lesedi le le phatsimang** (Excitation caused by shining light).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...diathomo di fetlhwa ke lesedi le le tsabakelang, le le bakang go re go ntshiwe photon ya lesedi..."" This directly translates to ""atoms are excited by shining light, which causes a photon of light to be emitted.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ntsha maatla a a oketsegileng** (Releasing excess energy) - While true that energy *is* released, the passage doesn't state this is the *cause* of the photon emission, but rather a *result* of it.
*   **C: Maemo a a sa tlhomamang a maatla** (Unstable energy states) - The passage doesn't explicitly discuss unstable energy states, only that energy is involved.
*   **D: Go tsibogela marang ka tsela e e sa siamang** (Incorrectly absorbing matter) - This is not mentioned at all in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se kgabagare se tla dirang gore tleloupo e emise go bereka?","The correct answer is **C: Thapo e e mo teng ga tleloupu e a tima** (The cord on the lamp is cut/broken).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...go tshwanetse go re go tingwe motlakase o o yang kwa leboneng, kgotsa thapo ya teng, e somolwe."" ( ""...it must be that the electricity going to the lamp, or its cord, is cut."")  This directly points to a problem with the cord as the cause of the lamp not working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mabone ga a timiwe sentle** (The bulbs aren't screwed in properly) - The passage doesn't mention the bulbs at all.
* **B: E na le motheo wa tshipi wa tleloupu e le nngwe fela** (It has only one metal base) -  The passage doesn't discuss the lamp's base.
* **D: Motlakase o tsena mo seleng o a fokotsega** (The electricity entering the house is decreasing) - The passage focuses specifically on the lamp and its cord, not a general power issue.



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e ka nnang kotsi go se ama fa o fetola tleloupo?,"The correct answer is **C: Beisi ya tleloupu (The base of the lamp)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text specifically warns against touching the metal parts of the lamp socket (beisi ya tleloupu) while it's still plugged in, as it could deliver a strong electric shock. It highlights the danger of a short circuit and electric shock if you touch the socket while it still has power.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the primary danger mentioned:

*   **A: Mogala (Wire)** - While a damaged wire is dangerous, the text focuses on the immediate risk of the socket.
*   **B: Switšhi ya lebone (Light switch)** - The switch itself isn't described as a direct shock hazard in the passage.
*   **D: Mogala (Wire)** - Same reasoning as A.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go direga eng fa nutlease e kgaogana?","The correct answer is **B: Go ntshiwa maatla (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bomb ya Fission e dira ka molaotheo wa gore e tsaya maatla go go kopantsha nucleus le diproton tse dintsi le dineutron."" This translates to: ""A fission bomb works on the principle that it *releases energy* when splitting a nucleus into many protons and neutrons.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diprotone di a oketsega (Protons increase):** The passage says the nucleus *splits* into protons and neutrons, it doesn't say the number of protons necessarily increases.
*   **C: Diathomo ga di tlhomame (Atoms do not stabilize):** The passage talks about unstable nuclei being prone to decay, not stabilization.
*   **D: Di-neutron di a nyelela (Neutrons move):** While neutrons *are* released during fission, the primary characteristic described in the passage is the release of energy.



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e bontshang gore go na le difouno tsa sekgala se seleele tse di yang kwa Lefatsheng,"The correct answer is **B: Disathalaete**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sathalaete e e mo lefaufaung e amogela mogala e bo e o busetsa kwa tlase, mo e ka nnang ka ponyo ya leitlho."" This directly translates to ""Satellites in space receive signals and send them back down, which can be received like an eye.""  This clearly indicates satellites are involved in receiving and transmitting signals *to* Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dithelesekoupo (Telescopes):** The passage mentions telescopes being *placed* in space by rockets, but not that they *receive* signals from space to Earth.
*   **C: Dipone (Cameras):** Cameras are mentioned as being used with satellites to improve images of Earth, but don't themselves receive signals.
*   **D: Didirisiwa tsa rokete (Rocket tools):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, but aren't the receivers of signals.



"
Ke efe ya tsone e e dirisiwang go romela thelesekoupo mo lefaufaung?,"The correct answer is **B: Didirisiwa tsa rokete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go tsaya rokete e kgolo thata bogodimo jwa dikgato di feta 100 go ya kwa godimo go baya sathalaete kgotsa thelesekoupu mo lefaufaung.""  This directly translates to ""It takes a large rocket to lift a satellite or telescope into space.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marang a Lesedi (Light rays)** - Light rays are *observed* by telescopes, not used to launch them.
*   **C: Atemosefere ya lefatshe (Earth's atmosphere)** - The atmosphere is what rockets need to *overcome* to reach space, not what launches things.
*   **D: Disathalaete tse di kwa godimo ga dimetara di le 100 (Satellites above 100 meters)** - This describes satellites themselves, not the method of getting them into space.



"
Ke eng se re tshwanetseng go se ela tlhoko ka tiragalo e e diregang gangwe le gape gore re kgone go bona gore nako e tsamaya jang?,"The correct answer is **B: Go boeletsa (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O kgona go tshwaya go feta ga nako ka bowena ka go lebelela dilo tse di diragalelang ka go **ipoeletsa kgapetsakgapetsa**."" 

""Ipoeletsa kgapetsakgapetsa"" directly translates to ""repeating yourself"" or ""observing things repeatedly.""  This is how you perceive the passage of time – by noticing how things change *through repetition* and comparing those changes over time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lobaka (Interval/Space):** While the passage mentions using time to measure the interval between events, it doesn't say repetition *is* the interval.
* **C: Go ama (To touch):**  The passage says time ""affects everything,"" but doesn't suggest touching things is how you perceive it.
* **D: Bothata (Difficulty):** The passage acknowledges time is hard to understand, but doesn't suggest difficulty is how you *notice* its passage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, nako e dirisiwa go tshwantsha karolo efe ya tiragalo?","The correct answer is **A: Boleele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nako e dirisiwa gape go lekanya **lobaka lwa ditiragalo**.""  ""Lobaka"" translates to **duration** or **length** of an event.  Duration is essentially how long something *lasts* - its **boleele** (length/duration).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go boeletsa (Repetition):** The passage doesn't focus on events repeating.
* **C: Maitemogelo (Feelings/Emotions):** While time *can* affect feelings, the passage focuses on its measurement of events.
* **D: Go ama (Touching/Affecting):**  The passage mentions time *influencing* everything, but the question asks what time is used to *measure* about an event.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e tsewang e le e e tshwanelang moruaboswa wa bogosi?","The correct answer is **D: Go ya yunibesithing pele ga ke ya bosoleng**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Charles *went to* university (Trinity College, Cambridge) *before* following the tradition of going into the military. It highlights this as unusual, contrasting it with the traditional path of previous heirs.  While he *did* get a 2:2 (A), that's a result *of* going to university, not the defining characteristic of what was different about him. Options B and C are things he did, but not what sets him apart from previous heirs."
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e mo serapeng seno, Charles e ne e le ene wa ntlha go dira eng?","The correct answer is **C: Bona dikirii**.

The passage states: ""Charles e ne ele motho wa ntlha wa Lelapa la Segosi sa Borithane go abelwa dikirii."" This translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded degrees.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ne a tlhamalela ko sesoleng pele ga a fetsa sekolo** - While true, the passage states this about his father, not Charles.
*   **B: Ithute Thutamarope** - This isn't directly stated as something he was the *first* to do.
*   **D: Tsena Trinity College** - While he did go to Trinity College, the passage highlights that he was the first to *get degrees* from a university, not just attend.



"
Sekepe sa ga Trygvasson se ne se tswa kwa nageng efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text specifically states: ""...yo o boetseng ko **Norway** go ya go leka go tsaya bogosi jwa gagwe ka phenyo e tlhakatlhakaneng."" (who returned to **Norway** to try to take his kingdom by violent means). This directly links Olaf Trygvasson to Norway.



"
Jeremane e ne ya tlhotlheletsa setso sa Estonia thata ka nako efe?,"The correct answer is **B: Dingwaga di ka nna 400 tse di fetileng**.

Here's why:

The passage states the influence was during the 15th century. Counting back from today (2024), the 15th century was approximately 600-400 years ago (1401-1500).  Of the options provided, 400 years ago is the closest and most reasonable estimate.
"
Ke eng se se neng sa tlhotlheletsa puo ya Seestonia?,"The correct answer is **B: Alefabete ya Sejeremane**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Estonian written language *began* with the German alphabet, and then the unique letter ""Õ/õ"" was added.  The influence of the German alphabet is the foundational factor in the development of written Estonian, and therefore the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhaka Õ/õ** - While important, this was *added to* the existing German alphabet, it wasn't the initial influence.
*   **C: Baitlami ba Majeremane** - The priests *used* the alphabet, but the alphabet itself was the influencing factor.
*   **D: Modimo** - The priests wanted to bring religion to the people, but that's the *reason* for their actions, not the thing that influenced the language itself.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, palo ya batho ba ba buang Se-Hindi e farologana go ya ka ntlha efe?","The correct answer is **C: Fa batho ba ba tlhaloganyang puo eo ba balwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phopholetso e simolola go tloga go dimilione di le 340 go ya go di le 500 tsa dibui, mme bontsi jo bo ka nnang kana ka dimilione di le 800 bo ka tlhaloganya puo."" This clearly indicates the variation in numbers comes from *whether you count people who understand the language* (even if they don't speak it fluently) versus those who speak it as their native language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While Hindi and similar languages are mentioned, the passage doesn't say the variation is *because* of including similar languages.
*   **B:** Urdu is mentioned as related, but the variation isn't based on *including* Urdu speakers.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about literacy/reading ability as a factor in the varying numbers.



"
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri ka Sehindi le Seurdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Di farologana ka mokwalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Teme ya Hindi le ya Urdu di tshwana ka puo mme di farologana mo go kwaleng."" This directly translates to ""The Hindi and Urdu languages are similar in speech but differ in writing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gantsi batho ba ba buang dipuo tseno ka bobedi ga ba utlwane** - The passage says the opposite: ""...babui ba diteme tsoo-pedi go le ga ntsi ba a tlhaloganyana"" (many speakers of these two languages can understand each other).
*   **C: Di tshwana ka mafoko le ka mokwalo** - The passage clearly states they differ in writing.
*   **D: Di farologana ka mafoko** - The passage states they are *similar* in speech (meaning similar vocabulary).



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e seng boammaaruri ka dialefabete tsa Sehangeul?,"The correct answer is **A: E ne ya tlhamiwa kwa tshimologong ya puso ya ga Kgosi Sejong**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hangeul was created in **1444**, *during* the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450), but not at the *beginning* of his reign. He ruled for many years before Hangeul was developed.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Leina la ntlhantlha la mokwalo ono e ne e le Hunan Jeongeum** - The passage directly states the original name was Hunmin Jeongeum.
*   **C: E ne ya tlhamiwa ke kgosi ya bonè ya Mmusomogolo wa Joseon** - The text confirms King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty.
*   **D: E ne ya tlhamilwe ka bomo** - The passage mentions Hangeul was designed with deliberate intention (""ditlhaka tse di dirilweng ka maikaelelo"").



"
Kgabagare dialefabete tsa Hunmin Jeongeum di ne tsa fetolwa go nna eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""o ne a taya alfabete ya Hangeul leina la Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""he named the alphabet of Hangeul the name Hunmin Jeongeum..."". This directly indicates that Hunmin Jeongeum became known as Hangeul.



"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke dipuo dife tse di neng tsa tlhotlhelediwa ke Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Dipuo tsa India**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Sanskrit ke puo e e thata tota e e humileng, e e leng yone e diteme tse dintsi tsa segompieno tsa letso la se-India di simolotseng ka yone, fela jaaka Selatine se simolotse dipuo tsa Yuropa tse di jaaka Sefora le se-Spain."" This directly says many modern Indian languages originated from Sanskrit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipuo tsa Selatine:** The text *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, but doesn't say Sanskrit influenced Latin.
*   **B: Dipuo tsa Yuropa:** The text states Latin influenced European languages, not Sanskrit.
*   **C: Dipuo tsa bogologolo:** While Sanskrit *is* an ancient language, the question asks which languages it *influenced*.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ne ga fokotsega go dirisiwa ga Sanskrit ka ntlha ya eng?","The correct answer is **D: Thulaganyotatelano**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Morago ga gore Upanishads e kgobokanngwe, Sanskrit e ile ya nyelela ka ntlha ya thulaganyotatelano."" This directly translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit began to decline due to simplification.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: e e thata (it is difficult)** - While the passage mentions Sanskrit is a difficult language, it doesn't say this *caused* its decline.
*   **B: Go fuduga ga ma-Aryan (The migration of the Aryans)** - The passage states this is how Sanskrit *came to be*, not why it declined.
*   **C: Selatine (Latin)** - Latin is used as a comparison to Sanskrit, not as a cause for its decline.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri malebana le kgogelofatshe a Io?","The correct answer is **A: Maatla a magolo a lefatshe a ka go gogela kwa tlase go feta maatla a magolo a lefatshe** (Gravity on Io can pull you down less than gravity on Earth).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bokete ja ga go bo ka nna ko tlase go na le fa o le mo Lefatsheng."" This directly translates to ""your weight will be lower than when you are on Earth.""  This means the gravitational pull is weaker on Io.
* **Options B, C, and D** all suggest you would feel *more* weight or that gravity would be *stronger* on Io, which is the opposite of what the passage says.

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects the information provided in the passage."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang a a tlhalosang sentle gore ngwedi o na le karolo efe e e kwa ntle?","The correct answer is **C: Go ka nna ga bo go na le Maria yo monnye kwa letlhakoreng le lengwe**.

*   The passage states: ""Karolo e e ka fa ntle ya Ngwedi e bidiwa legogo."" and ""Go ka tswa go na le mawatle a mantsi mo letlhakoreng le le ka kwano ka go re legogo la teng le le sesanyane.""
*   ""Maria"" (plural of ""mare"") are dark, basaltic plains on the Moon, formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. These are essentially the ""seas"" or ""lowlands"" mentioned as being potentially more abundant on the far side (legogo).
*   The passage describes the legogo as being *sesane* (flat/low-lying), suggesting the presence of maria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions the legogo being *sesane* (flat/low) not having cliffs (*dikgapetla tse di motsu*).
*   **B:** The passage contrasts the legogo (flat areas) with *dithaba* (mountains), but doesn't say anything about the mountain's snow.
*   **D:** The passage says maria may be *under* the mountains, not *below* them.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kae mo kgolokwe ya ngwedi e leng tona thata gone?","The correct answer is **A: Mo letlhakoreng le le gaufi** (On the near side).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Legogo le, le boteng ja dikhilomithara di ka nna masome a supa (70km) mo letlhakoreng le le gaufi, le bo le nna dikhilomithara di ka nna lekgolo mo letlhakoreng le le kgakala.""  This means the crust (legogo) is thinner on the near side (70km) than the far side (100km).  A thinner crust means it's less dense/softer. Therefore, the crust is *softer* on the near side.

"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e batho bangwe ba e dumelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go na le botshelo mo dipolaneteng tse dingwe** (There is life on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bangwe ba dumela go re go na le batho ba ba sa tsheleng jaaka rona kgotsa botshelo jo bongwe jo bo farologanang le jwa rona."" This directly translates to ""some believe that there are people who did not live like us or another life different from ours,"" which implies a belief in life existing elsewhere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batho ba ile ba ya kwa dinaleding tse dingwe** (People went to other stars) - The passage *speculates* about future travel, but doesn't state it has already happened.
*   **B: Batho ga ba kgone go ithuta ka mafatshe a mangwe** (People cannot learn about other worlds) - The passage suggests curiosity about other worlds and future possibilities of understanding them.
*   **D: Go na le dikilometara di le dibilionebilione fa gare ga dinaledi** (There are billions of kilometers between stars) - While true, this is a statement of *fact* about the universe, not a *belief* people hold as described in the passage.



"
Ke eng se se nnang sennye fa o ntse o katogela kgakala le bogare jwa letsatsi?,"The correct answer is **A: Plasema**.

Here's why:

The text states the sun is made of gases, fire, and electricity (which creates plasma). It also mentions that gas is released from the sun's core.  Plasma is a state of matter where gas becomes ionized and carries an electrical charge. This is what you encounter as you move away from the sun's core.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Molelo (Fire):** While the sun *appears* fiery, it's not literally burning in the same way a fire on Earth does. It's a nuclear reaction.
*   **C: Gase (Gas):**  While the sun *contains* gas, the material you encounter moving outwards is in a more energetic state – plasma.
*   **D: Khukhwane (Dust):** Dust is not the primary component of the sun's internal structure.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke karolo efe ya letsatsi e e bonalang go tswa mo lefatsheng?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Selo se re se bonang mo bokafantleng jwa letsatsi se bidiwa **photosphere**, mo go rayang go re ”kgolokwe ya lesedi”.""  This directly translates to ""What we see on the surface of the sun is called the **photosphere**, which is also known as the 'sphere of light'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kherasete:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Plasema:** While the sun *is* made of plasma, the passage doesn't say that's what we *see*.
*   **D: Bogare:** The passage says the core is where the energy originates, but not what we see.



"
Ke eng se se neng sa thusa go tlhomamisa kgopolo ya ga Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Dikarolo tsa Venus** (The phases of Venus).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Maphata a a Venus a rurifaditse kakanyetso ya ga Copernicus ya go re dipolanete di dikologa latsatsi.""  This means the observation of Venus having phases (like the moon) *supported* or *strengthened* Copernicus's theory that planets orbit the sun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go tsamaya ga Venus** (Venus's movement) - While Venus does move, the text focuses on *how it looks* (its phases) as the confirming evidence.
*   **C: Go tshwana ga Letsatsi le Venus** (Similarity between the Sun and Venus) - The text doesn't mention any specific similarities.
*   **D: Go tshwana ga Letsatsi le Ngwedi** (Similarity between the Sun and the Moon) - The text uses the moon as an *analogy* to explain the phases of Venus, but doesn't claim the sun and moon are similar in a way that supports Copernicus.



"
Galileo Galilei o ne a bona eng mo go seno se se latelang ka 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikarolo tsa Venus**.

The text explicitly states: ""ka 1610, molebeledi wa dinaledi wa kwa Italy Galileo Galilei o dirisitse selebakgakala sa dinaledi go lemoga fa Venus e na le maphata a mabedi, fela jaaka ngwedi."" (In 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to discover that Venus has phases, just like the moon).  These ""maphata"" are the phases, or different illuminated portions, of Venus.
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Noka ya Amazon e tsaya metsi kae?","The correct answer is **A: Dinoka tse dinnye**.

The passage states: ""Noka e konokono ya Amazon e tsaya metsi a yone go tswa mo dinokaneng tse dinnye di le diketekete."" (The mighty Amazon draws its water from thousands of small rivers.)
"
Ke tlotlo efe e e sa newang Noka ya Amazon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke noka e telele go di feta tsotlhe**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Noka ya Amazon ke noka ya bobedi e telele le e kgolo go gaisa mo Lefatsheng.""  This means it is the *second* longest, but the text *doesn't* claim it's the longest overall. However, it does state it is the largest.  The options are looking for what the Amazon is *not* credited with, and being the longest is what it's not credited with in the passage.

*   **A** is incorrect because the text specifically states it's the *second* longest.
*   **B** is correct, the text says Amazon is the largest.
*   **D** is incorrect. The passage describes its width and volume of water, implying it is very substantial but doesn’t mention its strength (atlhameng thata)."
Ke tiro efe e go buiwang ka yone mo serapeng seno e e thapang Ba-Venezuela ba le mmalwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Oli (Oil)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kgwebo ya botlhokwa mo bathong ba Venezuela ke lookwane, koo naga e leng yone e e romelang lookwane kwa dinageng tse dingwe go gaisa..."" This translates to ""The most important industry for Venezuelans is oil, as the country is the one sending oil to other countries the most...""

While the passage mentions other jobs, it specifically highlights oil as the *most important* industry and a key economic activity for Venezuelans.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke lefapha lefe mo go a a latelang le le thapang batho ba le bantsi go gaisa mo Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Tirelo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nngwe-peding ya batho ba kwa Venezuela ba ba dirang ba mo ditirong tsa ditirelo..."" which translates to ""One-third of Venezuelans who work are in the service sector...""  This is a larger proportion than the ""nngwe-tlhanong"" (one-sixth) working in agriculture. The text doesn't mention ""madirelo"" (shops) or ""oli"" (oil) employing a significant number of people.

Therefore, the service sector employs the most people in Venezuela according to the passage.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go kopana ga dinaledi go dira gore dinaledi di kgone go dira eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go ntsha lesedi le mogote** (To release a lot of light).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dinaledi di ntsha lesedi le mogote ka ntlha ya maatla a nnang gone fa diathomo tsa hydrogen di kopanngwa (kgotsa tswakantswe) mmogo go dira dielemente tse di boketenyana."" This directly translates to ""Stars release a lot of light because of the energy released when hydrogen atoms are combined (or fused) together to make heavier elements.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dira dilo tse di bokete** (To make heavy things) - While stars *do* create heavier elements, the passage focuses on light release as the primary result.
*   **B: Go aga di-fusion reactor** (To build fusion reactors) - The passage mentions scientists *trying* to build reactors, but stars themselves don't build them.
*   **D: Dira diatomo tsa haeterojene** (To make hydrogen atoms) - Stars *use* hydrogen atoms, they don't create them in this process.



"
Ke eng se se latelang se se ka dirwang ke motshodi wa nutliliya o o nang le mosola?,"The correct answer is **A: Hydrogen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that stars (Dinaledi) generate immense energy when **hydrogen atoms** are fused together. A nuclear reactor trying to replicate this process *needs* hydrogen as its fuel source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dinaledi (Stars):**  Stars *use* hydrogen, they aren't what a reactor needs *to* use.
*   **C: Diathomo (Atoms):**  Too general. While fusion involves atoms, it specifically needs hydrogen atoms in this context.
*   **D: Maatla a Motlakase (Electrical Energy):**  Electrical energy is a *result* of generating power, not the fuel source for fusion.



"
Metsi a dirilwe ka dikhemikale dife?,"The correct answer is **D: Diathomo se pedi tsa haeterojene le athomo e le nngwe ya okosejene**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kopanyo ya metsi e dirilwe ka athomo tse pedi tsa hydrogen le atom e le nngwe ya mowa o phepha."" 

*   ""hydrogen"" translates to ""okosejene"" in Setswana.
*   ""oxygen"" translates to ""mowa o phepha"" in Setswana.
*   ""athomo tse pedi tsa hydrogen"" means ""two atoms of hydrogen"".
*   ""atom e le nngwe ya mowa o phepha"" means ""one atom of oxygen"".

Therefore, water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom."
"Fa metsi a fetoga, ke eng se se tla nnelang ruri?","The correct answer is **A: Sebopego sa dimolekhule** (The molecular structure).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Le fa sebopego sa yone se ka fetoga, seemo sa yone sa khemikhale se nna se le jalo."" (Even if its form changes, its chemical state remains the same.) This directly refers to the molecular structure staying consistent even as the physical state (gas, solid, liquid) changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boima (Weight):**  Weight can change slightly due to density differences between states, but isn't a fundamental constant.
* **C: Boemo jwa mmele (Physical state):** The passage *emphasizes* that the physical state *changes*.
* **D: Naetherojene e e mo metsing (Nitrogen in water):**  Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen, not nitrogen.  And even if it did contain nitrogen, the *amount* of nitrogen wouldn't be what fundamentally defines water.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e se bothata mo dinageng tse di lesome le boraro fa di ne di leka go tlhoma melao e e rileng?","The correct answer is **C: Diphetogo tse di tlhokang go amogelwa ka bongwefela jwa pelo** (Changes requiring unanimous agreement).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditlhogo tseno di ne di tlhoka tumalano ka botlalo ya dinaga tsotlhe pele ga fa e ka felolwa mme naga e ne ya tsaya puso ya bogare botsatsa tota mo e leng go re baemedi ba yone go le ga ntsi ba ne ba sa nne teng.""  This directly translates to ""These issues required unanimous agreement from all states before they could be amended, and the country was taking a long time to govern because many of its representatives were not present.""

This explains the difficulty in forming effective laws – *every* state had to agree, which was incredibly hard to achieve and slowed down the process significantly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puso e dira ka natla go laola dilo** (Government struggles to control things) - While a consequence of the weaknesses, it wasn't the *root* cause of the difficulty in forming laws.
*   **B: Go tlhoka maatla mo Kongereng** (Lack of power in Congress) - The passage does mention Congress having limited powers, but the specific difficulty with laws was the need for unanimous agreement.
*   **D: Puso ya bosetšhaba e e sa nneng teng** (Lack of a national government) – There *was* a national government (the Congress under the Articles of Confederation), but it was weak and ineffective because of the issues described in the text.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke polelo efe e e bontshang sentle boemo jwa puso ya bogare ka nako ya Ntwa ya Kgololesego?","The correct answer is **C: Baemedi ba puso ba ne ba seyo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...naga e ne ya tsaya puso ya bogare botsatsa tota mo e leng go re baemedi ba yone go le ga ntsi ba ne ba sa nne teng."" (The country was suffering under the old government because its representatives were often absent).  This directly points to a key weakness - lack of consistent representation and participation in government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Makgetho a ne a patelediwa ke Congress le balaodi ba puso** - The passage doesn't mention anything about taxes being levied. It focuses on the *inability* to effectively govern.
* **B: Diphetogo tse di neng di dirwa mo Ditemaneng di ne di ikaegile ka taolo ya Kongerese** -  The passage states the opposite - changes to the Articles required *unanimous* agreement from all states, making amendment very difficult.
* **D: Puso e kgolo e ne e na le dikarolo tse pedi tsa konokono** - The passage states that the government under the Articles of Confederation only had *one* branch - Congress.



"
Mafoko a a mo morago ga Maiphako a Kgololesego a kwadilwe jang?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka ditlhaka tse dikgolo**.

The passage states: """"Maikano a kwa Tshimologong a Boipuso a a kwadilweng ka di-4 tsa Phukwi 1776"""" ka fa morago ga Maikano a Boipuso. The passage doesn't mention a code, cipher, or small handwriting, but it explicitly states the additional text was *written*.  The passage also states that the writing is *signed* implying legible writing rather than a code."
Singapore e itsege ka eng mo go tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Botala jwa ditoropo (Gardening/Urban greenery)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Singapore Botanic Gardens helped develop the country into a ""beautiful garden city."" It also mentions the national flower, Vanda Miss Joaquim, highlighting the importance of plants and gardening in Singaporean identity.  The passage focuses on the botanical aspect of Singapore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go gwanta (Shopping):** While Singapore is known for shopping, the passage doesn't mention it.
* **C: Metshameko ya bogatlhamelamasisi (Spectator sports):**  The passage doesn't discuss sports.
* **D: Go tshameka tsa botaki (Financial matters/Banking):**  The passage doesn't relate to finance.



"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ke eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Lelomo la bosechaba la naga.**

Here's why:

The passage states directly: ""Ka 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, lelomo la kwa tshimologong la orchid le ne la tlhophiwa go nna lelomo la bosechaba la naga."" (In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid originally from the area, was chosen to be the national flower of the country.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Setlhaketlhake** - While it *is* a plant, the passage specifically defines it as more than just a plant.
* **B: Lelomo le le mo tshimologong** - This is true, but doesn't capture its full significance as stated in the passage.
* **C: Tshingwana ya dimela** - This is too general; it's a specific type of flower.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke nonofo efe ya Mantswe a kwa Giza e Baegepeto ba Bogosi jo Bosha ba neng ba sa e rate?","The correct answer is **C: Bogolo jwa tsone**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""diphiramiti tsa Giza le ka motlha di ne di sa fetiwe ke dipe ka **bogolo** le ka botswerere jwa setegeniki jwa go agiwa ga tsone.""  It then says the new kingdom Egyptians were ""kgakge ke dikago tseno tse dikgolo,"" which translates to ""intimidated by these great structures."" This directly links the intimidation to the *size* (bogolo) of the pyramids.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bogolo** - While related, the text specifies they were intimidated by the *size* of the structures, not just ""size"" in general.
*   **B: Go dirisa leje** - The text doesn't mention anything about using levers.
*   **D: Go agiwa ga tsone** -  The text mentions the engineering complexity of their construction, but the intimidation stemmed from their size (""dikago tseno tse dikgolo"").



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ditshedi tse di jang dimela di tsamaya di tswa kae go ya go batla dipula?","The correct answer is **A: Dithota tse di kwa bokone** (The plains in the north).

The text states: ""Go tswa kwa dithoteng tse di kwa bokone di latelela dipula."" which translates to ""From the plains in the north they follow the rains."" This clearly indicates the origin of their journey.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, diphologolo tse di jang ditlhare le bojang di tswa mo lefelong lefe ka kgwedi ya Moranang?","The correct answer is **A: Kgaolo ya Serengeti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go tswa fo di boela gape kwa bokone di feta ka fa bophirima, di tshela gape noka ya Mara, **morago ga dipula ka kgwedi ya Moranang**."" This means the animals return *from* the Serengeti area (implied by the previous sentence about traveling south) and cross the Mara River after the rains in Moranang (March).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dithota tse di kwa borwa:** The animals travel *to* the southern areas, they don't originate there in March.
*   **C: Noka ya Mara:** The Mara River is where they *cross*, not where they come from.
*   **D: Lefelo la Diphologolo la Maasai Mara:** While they pass through Maasai Mara, the text indicates they're returning *from* the Serengeti area.



"
Operation Sealion e ne e le tlhaselo ya naga efe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeremane**.

The text states: ""Jeremane ya simolola go ipaakanyetsa go tlhasela setlhaketlhake sa Boritane. Jeremane e ne ya bitsa tlhaselo eo """"Operation Sealion""""."" This clearly indicates that Operation Sealion was a planned attack by Germany (Jeremane).



"
Jeremane e ne ya bitsa tlhaselo eo ya kwa Boritane jang?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Jeremane e ne ya bitsa tlhaselo eo """"Operation Sealion""""."" (Germany called that attack ""Operation Sealion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk** - Dunkirk was a *location* where British and Allied soldiers were evacuated, not the name of the planned invasion.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine** - This is the name of the German Navy.
*   **D: Royal Navy** - This is the name of the British Navy.



"
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang e le kgato e e tlhokegang mo thulaganyong ya Italy ya go gapa dinaga tsa Aforika?,"The correct answer is **A: Go fedisa mafelo a dikepe kwa Egepeto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka ntlha ya seo, ba ile ba tshwanelwa ke go fedisa mafelo a masole le dikepe tsa Borithane kwa Egepeto.""  This means destroying British bases in Egypt was *necessary* for Italy's plan to control the Mediterranean and invade Africa. The passage explicitly frames it as a requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go aga dikepe tse dingwe:** The passage says Italy *already* had advanced ships, and further ship-building wasn't presented as a necessary step for the African conquest.
*   **C: Go tlhoma lefelo la go latlhela masole:** While building up a strong military was mentioned, the passage doesn't highlight establishing training grounds as a *critical* initial step.
*   **D: Go senya mafelo a Borithane:**  While damaging British facilities is part of the requirement, specifically targeting the *naval bases in Egypt* is what's emphasized as essential for their strategy.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, boikaelelo jo bogolo jwa ntwa ya Italy e ne e le bofe?","The correct answer is **A: Go gapa mafatshe a Aferika**.

The passage states: ""Maikaelelo magolo a Italy e ne e le dinaga tsa Aforika. Go gapa dinaga tseo..."" This directly identifies conquering African nations as Italy's main objective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go aga sesole le sesole sa lewatle se se nonofileng** - While Italy *needed* to build a strong military, this was a *means* to an end (conquering Africa), not the main objective itself.
*   **C: Go latlha dikepe tsa Egepeto** - Attacking Egyptian ships was a *necessary step* to achieve the main objective, but not the objective itself.
*   **D: Go tlhomiwa ga mafelo a sesole a Boritane** - Destroying British bases was also a *necessary step* but not the overarching goal.



"
Ke bomang ba ba neng ba dira botsalano le batlhasedi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bafora ba Vichy**.

The text specifically states: ""Bano e ne e le batho ba Mafora ba ba ileng ba dira kagiso le Majeremane ka 1940 ba bo ba dirisana le batlhasedi go na le go re ba ba lwantshe."" (These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the oppressors instead of fighting them.)



"
"""Ke bomang ba Balekane ba ba neng ba nna le seabe mo """"Operation Dragoon?""""""","The correct answer is **A: Baamerika le Bafora ba ba Gololesegileng**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mo dibekeng tse pedi fela masole a **Baamerika le Mafora a a Gololesegileng** a ne a golotse borwa jwa Fora mme a ya ntlheng ya Jeremane."" This directly answers the question about who participated in Operation Dragoon.



"
Ke thekenoloji efe e e neng ya dira gore dikepe tsa kafa tlase ga metsi di simolole go tsamaya kafa tlase ga metsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefelo la go thuntsha (Ballast)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that early submarines were buoyant and couldn't submerge easily. As sonar technology improved, submarines began to submerge to avoid detection.  This implies a mechanism to *control* buoyancy – to make the submarines heavier than water to sink, and lighter to rise.  That mechanism is the ballast system (lefelong la go thuntsha).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di-U-Boat (U-Boats):**  U-boats were *types* of submarines, not the technology that enabled them to submerge.
*   **C: Go tsamaya ka sekepe (Ship travel):** This is just a general term for sailing and doesn't explain submersion.
*   **D: Radar:** Radar was used to *detect* submarines, not to help them submerge.



"
"Ka nako ya fa dikepe tse di tsamayang kafa tlase ga metsi di ne di dirisiwa lekgetlho la ntlha, di ne di kgona go fofa ka selekanyo se se lekanyeditsweng mo karolong efe?","The correct answer is **C: Go thunya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kwa tshimologong ya ntwa bontsi jwa sebaka di ne di tsamaya mo godimo ga lewatle, mme fa didiriswa tsa go tsibosa di simolola go tlhabololwa le go nepa dilo le go feta, dikepe tsa ka fa tlase ga lewatle di ne tsa patelesega go ya kwa tlase ga metsi go tila go re di seka tsa bonwa."" 

This means initially, submarines (dikepe tsa ka fa tlase ga metsi) primarily *traveled on the surface* (go tsamaya mo godimo ga lewatle).  As technology improved to detect them, they began to rely on *submerging* (go ya kwa tlase ga metsi) – which is essentially *diving* (go thunya).  The text specifically mentions they couldn't ""thunyetsa kgakala"" (dive deeply) at first, meaning their initial diving capability was limited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tsamaya (To travel):** While they traveled, the key change was *how* they traveled - from the surface to underwater.
*   **B: Go tsamaya (To travel):** Same reasoning as A.
*   **D: Tiro (Work/Duty):** This refers to their function, not their movement capability.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a tlola tumalano? ","The correct answer is **D: Masoviet** (Soviet Union).

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states that the Soviet Union *violated* (or ""tsuolola"" in Setswana, meaning broke/undermined) the following agreements:

*   Riga Peace Treaty
*   Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact
*   Other agreements between them and other countries.

Therefore, the Soviet Union is the one who broke the agreements.



"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se se neng sa se ka sa dirwa ke Sesole se Sehibidu?,"The correct answer is **D: Go tlola kgolagano (To break agreements)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland *violated* several agreements: the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other agreements.  This means they *broke agreements* (go tlola kgolagano).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tlhamiwa ga karolo ya Ukraine (Occupying a portion of Ukraine):** The passage says they invaded Belarus *and* Ukraine, so occupation was *done*, not something they couldn't do.
* **B: Go tlhasela dikgaolo tsa kwa botlhaba (Attacking eastern territories):**  They *did* attack the eastern part of Poland.
* **C: Go rulaganngwa seša go bapa le tlhogo ya borogo (To agree to retreat to the border):**  The passage mentions Polish soldiers retreating to the Romanian border, but doesn't say anything about the Soviets agreeing to that.



"
Go ne ga direga eng ka Moenjenere yo Mogolo wa Sesole sa Bosome sa Italy?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a tshwarwa kwa Fort Capuzzo**.

The text states: ""Mo tlhaselong ko bophirima jwa Bardia, ba Britain ba thopile mogolwane wa tsa bo engineer wa sesole sa Italy, General Lastucci."" This means General Lastucci was captured. The location of his capture is implied to be near Bardia, and linked to the taking of Fort Capuzzo.
"
Italo Balbo o ne a bolawa kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Seetebosigo a le 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Tonakgolo wa Libya a a bileng gape e le motlhatlhami wa ga Mussolini, o ne a bolawa ke ba ga gabo fa a goroga **kwa Toburk**.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mekgwa efe e e latelang e e leng karolo ya botlhokwa ya go tlhatlhanya ga Setibetan?","The correct answer is **C: Go bona medimo ka leitlho la mogopolo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Fa motho a akanya thata medimo e e farologanyeng, boleng ja tlhaloganyo le maikutlo a gagwe di a totafala, a bo a simolola go tlelwa ke dikakanyo tsa enlightenment consciousness."" This directly relates to visualizing deities as a key component of Tibetan Buddhist practice and the pursuit of enlightenment.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Dithuthuntsho tsa go hema:** While breathing exercises are *mentioned* as part of Kundalini Yoga, they aren't presented as the core of Tibetan contemplation.
*   **B: Go boeletsa melaetsa:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Go ithuta go dira yoga:** Yoga is mentioned, specifically Kundalini Yoga, but the text emphasizes the *result* of that yoga (awakening energy) and the visualization of deities as the core contemplative practice.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, di-chakra di tshubiwa jang ka nako ya go tlhatlhanya ga Setibet?","The correct answer is **D: Dithuthuntsho tsa go hema** (Breathing exercises).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Ka ”Yoga” ya Kundalini...maatla a kundalini...a a tsosolosang boemo jwa mmele, **dithuthuntsho tsago hema**, maikanopoelelo le ponatshego.""  This directly links the activation of Kundalini energy, a core part of Tibetan Buddhist practice, to specific breathing exercises.  While the other options are present in Tibetan Buddhism (like meditation on deities), they aren't specifically mentioned as *how* chakras are awakened during visualization.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a opela pina ya bobedi ya boineelo ka nako ya thulaganyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Seopedi Sanju Sharma o nnile wa ntlha go opela mo bosigong, a latelwa ke Jai Shankar Choudhary...""  This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma was the first to sing in the evening, followed by Jai Shankar Choudhary...""

Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary sang the second song of the evening."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a opela pina ya boineelo fa go ne go ntshiwa dijo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Lakkha Singh o ne a tsaya ketapelo mo go opelweng ga difela."" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh took responsibility for singing while the offerings were being made.""  And then it adds that he also offered a Chhappan Bhog bhajan.

Therefore, Lakkha Singh was the one singing the devotional song while the food was being offered."
Tiragalo ya bofelo ya maitseboa e ne e le efe?,"The correct answer is **B: Molelo wa Anatolia**.

The passage states: ""E le go garela, setlhopha sa mmino sa ko Turkey e leng Fire of Anatolia se ne sa diragatsa setshwantsho sa """"Troy"""".""  This translates to ""To conclude, the Turkish music group Fire of Anatolia staged a depiction of """"Troy"""". "" 

Therefore, Fire of Anatolia's performance of ""Troy"" was the final event.
"
Alessandro Safina ke wa morafe ofe?,"The correct answer is **D: Moitaly**.

The text states: ""...le seopedi sa Italy sa lentswe la tinoro le se se tswang Greek, Gerika Haris Alexiou.""  This means Alessandro Safina is the Italian tenor mentioned.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a seng boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **D: Go ne ga tsaya metsotso e feta masome a marataro (60) go ntsha motho wa ntlha mo koloing**.

Here's why:

*   The text states ""mme go tsere **ura** go ntsha motho wa ntlha mo go yone.""  ""Ura"" means an hour, which is 60 minutes. So it took 60 minutes (1 hour), not *more than* 60 minutes.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Go ne ga nna le molelo kwa Santa Clara:** While not explicitly stated as a ""molelo"" (fire), the text describes extremely high heat (over 90 degrees Fahrenheit) which creates a fire-like condition. It's a reasonable inference and doesn't contradict the text.
*   **B: Batho ba ne ba tshwareletse mo koloing ya roller coaster:** The text mentions people being stuck ""fa tlase ga roller coaster"" and needing rescue, implying they were on the ride.
*   **C: Bapalami ba ne ba neelwa metsi:** The first sentence directly states ""Bapalami ba ne ba neelwa metsi"".



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a akgela ka mogote o o feteletseng?","The correct answer is **C: Bapalami**.

The text states: ""Bapalami ba ne ba neelwa metsi fa ba ne ba letile mo mogoteng o o feteletseng wa selekanyo sa 90(F)."" This directly translates to ""Tourists were given water as they waited in the excessive heat of 90(F)."" 

Therefore, the tourists (Bapalami) were the ones suffering in the excessive heat.



"
Ke kae koo go neng ga kgaolwa motlakase gone ka ntlha ya tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""...le fa ntswa go nnile le kgaogo ya motlakase ka nakwana, e go begilweng e kganetse bagolwane ba Tonga go amogela tlhagiso ya tsunami..."" which translates to ""...although there was a power outage briefly, which prevented the people of Tonga from receiving the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""
"
"Go ya ka serapa, Tonga e ne ya amiwa jang ke go tima motlakase?","The correct answer is **D: Balaodi ba ne ba sa kgone go amogela tsiboso tse di maleba** (Residents were unable to receive critical warnings).

Here's why:

The text states: ""... *e go begilweng e kganetse bagolwane ba Tonga go amogela tlhagiso ya tsunami e e ntshitsweng ke PTWC*."" This directly translates to ""...which prevented residents of Tonga from receiving the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""  The power outage *prevented* the residents from receiving the warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ne ga begiwa gore go na le tshenyo e e rileng** (There was reported extensive damage) - The text specifically states ""Ga go a begiwa ditshenyegelo kana dikgobalo tse di tona kwa Tonga"" (No damage or fatalities were reported in Tonga).
*   **B: Balaodi ga ba a ka ba utlwa sepe ka go tlosiwa ga ditlhagiso** (Residents heard nothing about the warnings being cancelled) - This isn't mentioned in the text. The issue was *receiving* the warning, not cancellation.
*   **C: Dipalo tsa lewatle di ne tsa amega** (Sea levels were affected) - The text mentions sea level measurements being taken *as a result of* the potential tsunami, but doesn't say they were affected *in Tonga*.



"
Ke leng mapodisi a neng a kgona go dirisa ditlhobolo tsa one tsa lenaka le le balang bofefo  go bona gore Jonny Reid o kgweetsa ka lobelo lo lo kana kang?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa a ntse a kgweetsa ka dikhilomithara di le 160 ka oura**.

Here's why:

The text states that police *finally* managed to use the speed camera to catch Reid when he *slowed down* to 160 km/h.  This implies they couldn't get a reading at his higher speeds.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mo lekgetlong la bosupa fa a feta mo borogong:** The text doesn't say they were able to use the camera on his second pass.
* **C: Fa a ntse a kgweetsa ka dikhilomithara di feta 160 ka oura:**  The text explicitly states they *couldn't* get a reading at those speeds.
* **D: Mo lekgetlhong la ntlha fa a ne a kgabaganya borogo:** The text indicates the car was too low for the camera to function properly during his initial pass.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa go ne go le thata gore mapodisi a kwa New Zealand a kgone go laola lobelo lwa ga Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Koloi e ne e le kwa tlase thata** (The car was very low).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ba sepodisi sa New Zealand ba nnile le bothata go dirisa lenaka le le balang bofefo go bona go re Rre Reid o ne a tabogile jang ka ntlha ya go re koloi ya Black Beauty e ko tlase.""  This directly explains the difficulty police had in tracking his speed - the car was too low for the speed camera to effectively read.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ne a kgweetsa ka lebelo le le kwa tlase ga dikilometara di le 160 ka ura** (He was driving at a speed below 160 kilometers per hour) - This is *after* the police finally caught up to him, not why they initially had trouble.
*   **C: O ne a kgweetsa ka koloi go kgabaganya borogo makgetlho a le supa fela** (He was driving a car hugging the railing only a few times) - While he did drive close to the railing, this doesn't explain why the speed camera couldn't read the speed.
*   **D: Borogo jwa Boemakepe jwa Auckland bo tsofetse thata** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old) - The bridge's age isn't the reason for the difficulty in tracking the speed.



"
Thoromo ya lefatshe e ne e le fa kae fa e bapisiwa le Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: Dikhilomithara di le 65 kwa borwa**.

The text states: ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e ne e remeletse sekgele sa dikhilomithara tse 20 (dimaele tse 15), kwa bokone-bokone-botlhaba jwa Dillion, **dikhilomithara tse 65 (maele tse 40) mo borwa jwa Butte**.""
"
Go ne ga direga eng ka nako ya ditshupetso?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgokgontsho ya magolegwa** (Torture of prisoners).

The passage states the Abu Ghraib prison was infamous *because* of torture that occurred after the US military took control. The other options are either things that happened *after* the torture was revealed (D), or are not the primary issue (B, C).
"
Ke ka ntlha yang fa kgolegelo ya Iraq e ne ya tuma thata jaana? ,"The correct answer is **D: Go ribololwa ga kgokgontsho ya magolegwa** (The discovery of prisoners' abuse).

Here's why:

The passage states the prison ""gained notoriety *after* evidence of prisoner abuse surfaced.""  This directly links the increased attention to the abuse that was discovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E ne ya fisiwa** (It was destroyed) - The passage says it was *damaged* during riots, but that doesn't explain why it became notorious.
*   **B: Masole a Amerika a ne a tsaya marapo** (American soldiers took photos) - The photos were evidence *of* the abuse, not the reason the prison became notorious.
*   **C: Go ne ga nna le ditshupetso.** (There were riots) - The riots caused damage, but the *reason* it became famous was the abuse revealed.



"
Go ne go tlile go tshwarwa tiragalo ya mofuta ofe kwa War Memorial Stadium ya Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Maitiso a mmino**.

The passage states: ""Setlhopha se se emisitse **maitiso a mmino** a a neng a ya go tshwarelwa kwa lebaleng la Maui War Memorial..."" (The group cancelled a **music concert** that was going to be held at the Maui War Memorial...).



"
Ke mang yo kgabagare a neng a tlhalosa gore ke ka ntlha yang fa tiragalo eno e ile ya phimolwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Setheo se se okametseng botsamaisi (The entity responsible for management)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Setheo se se okametseng botsamaisi ja setlhopha sa HK Management Inc, ga se a fa tlhaloso ko tshimologong fa ba emisa ka Lwetse a le 20, mme ba tshwaya phoso mabaka a dithulaganyo letsatsi le le latelang.""  This directly translates to ""The entity responsible for management of HK Management Inc., did not give an explanation initially for cancelling on February 20th, but blamed the reasons on scheduling issues the following day.""

Therefore, the entity responsible for management is the one who eventually explained *why* the event was cancelled.



"
Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishkek ba ne ba akanya gore ke mang yo o neng a dira tiro eno?,"The correct answer is **D: Badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa Borwa**.

The text states: ""Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishbek ba ne ba pega badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa borwa molato ka ntlha ya botlhokatsebe jwa bone."" This directly translates to ""Many Bishkek residents blamed the migrants from the south for their crimes.""
"
Ke mang yo o neng a pega babopeledi ba kwa borwa molato wa go utswa dilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Baagi ba Bishkek**.

The text states: ""Baagi ba le mmalwa ba Bishbek ba ne ba pega badiraditshupetso ba ba tswang kwa borwa molato ka ntlha ya botlhokatsebe jwa bone."" This directly translates to ""A few residents of Bishkek blamed the migrants from the south for the looting.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Badiri ba makgotla a a diragatsang molao (Law enforcement officials)** - The text doesn't mention police or law enforcement blaming anyone.
* **C: Basenyi (Thieves)** - The text describes thieves *being* blamed, not *doing* the blaming.
* **D: Digongwana tsa batho (Gangs of people)** - While gangs were involved in the looting, they weren't the ones assigning blame.



"
Ring e ne ya oketsa dithekiso leng?,"The correct answer is **C: Morago ga go tlhagelela mo QVC**.

The passage states: ""Go ya kwa bofelong jwa ngwaga wa 2017, Siminoff o ne a tlhagelela mo thelebishening ya tsa theko mo chaneleng ya QVC."" This directly implies that Ring increased sales after appearing on QVC.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Morago ga go tlhagelela mo go Shark Tank:** The passage mentions the founder was upset the company was valued too low on Shark Tank, but doesn't say sales increased *because* of it.
*   **B: Morago ga go bona madi ka 2013:** The passage does not mention the company receiving funding in 2013.
*   **D: Morago ga go rarabolola kgetsi le ADT:** While the passage mentions a legal issue with ADT, it doesn't state this led to increased sales."
Jamie Siminoff o ne a swetsa leng go simolola Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa a sena go lemoga gore tshitswana e e kokotang,ya lebentlele, e ne e sa utlwale.**

Here's why:

The passage states Jamie Siminoff ""o ne a tshwaela fa kompone e simolodisitswe fa tshitswana e e kokotang ya lebentlele e ne e sa utlwale fa a le ko mabeelong a dikoloi."" This directly means he was inspired to start Ring after realizing a doorbell wouldn't be heard while he was away from home.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Morago ga go palelwa ke go dira tiro ya Shark Tank** - The passage doesn't mention Shark Tank.
*   **C: Morago ga go bona madi** - While funding is important, the passage states the *inspiration* came first.
*   **D: Morago ga go tlhagelela ka katlego kwa QVC** - QVC happened *after* Ring was already created; it wasn't the initial spark.



"
Kgaolo nngwe le nngwe ya Reading Rainbow e ne e naya bana dikatlageniso tsa eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Dibuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kgaolo nngwe le nngwe ya tshupegetso e, ... e ntsha kaelo ya dibuka tse bana ba ka di batlang fa ba ya ko motlobong wa dibuka wa bone."" This directly translates to ""Each episode... would release a list of books that children could request at their local library."" 

Therefore, each episode of Reading Rainbow provided lists of **books** for children.



"
"""Ke eng se se ka tswang se bakile gore go phimolwe motseletsele wa """"Reading Rainbow""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Madi a a sa lekaneng**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: *""go fokodiwa ga madi a a abelwang bagasi, ga mmogo le go fetola megopolo ka go re kgaso ya dithulaganyo tsa thuto e tshwanetse go nna jang, go nnile le seabe mo go emisiweng ga thulaganyo e.""*  This directly translates to funding cuts and changing ideas about educational programming contributing to the show's cancellation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlhoka dikgele tsa Emmy:** The passage mentions the show *winning* many Emmys, not lacking them.
* **C: Maikutlo a ga John Grant:** While John Grant is quoted, his opinion isn't presented as the *cause* of the cancellation, but rather as an explanation of the show's impact.
* **D: Katlego ya Mister Rogers' Neighborhood:** The passage mentions the show being aired alongside *Sesame Street* and *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, but doesn't suggest that the other shows' success led to *Reading Rainbow*'s demise.



"
Ke ntlha efe mo go tse di latelang e e neng e sa ganediwe ke badiredi ba kwa Amsterdam le ba musiamo malebana le setlhare?,"The correct answer is **A: Ruri e tla wa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that officials were worried the sculpture ""could cause major disturbances if it fell."" This is the concern they *disagreed* with - they didn't want to risk it falling, leading to the decision to postpone its removal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E tshwanetse go bolokiwa** - The passage implies they *were* planning to remove it eventually, so they didn't disagree with it needing to be removed at some point.
*   **C: E kgotletswe ke mouta** - This detail isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Go kotsi mo boitekanelong jwa batho** - The passage states this *was* their concern, not something they disagreed with.

"Go ya ka motlhatlhobi yo mogolo wa RSPCA, ditlhatlhobo di tshwanetse go nna selo se se tlwaelegileng mo go dife tsa dilo tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go tsenngwa ga dikhamera tsa go lebelela** (The installation of surveillance cameras).

Here's why:

The passage states David O'Shannessy believes ""monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be standard practice in Australia.""  He specifically uses CCTV cameras as an example of *how* to achieve this standard practice - through the installation of cameras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di-camera tsa CCTV** - While CCTV is *used* for monitoring, the core idea isn't just about the cameras themselves, but the act of monitoring.
*   **B: Mongwe le mongwe yo o berekang le diphologolo** - The passage focuses on slaughterhouses, not all animal owners.
*   **D: Dikago tsa polao ya diphologolo** - The passage discusses *preventing* cruelty, not just prosecuting cases after they happen.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se ka thusang go gatelela kafa go leng botlhokwa ka teng gore badiri ba kwa mafelong a go bolaelwang diphologolo kwa go one kwa Australia ba tlhokomele diphologolo?","The correct answer is **A: Go tsenya dikhamera tsa CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the RSPCA believes CCTV cameras send a ""strong message to people who mistreat animals that their actions are being watched."" This directly supports the idea that CCTV cameras help emphasize the importance of animal welfare in slaughterhouses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dipokano tse di patelesegang le RSPCA:** While meetings with the RSPCA might be helpful, the passage doesn't suggest this is what *specifically* helps emphasize the importance of care.
*   **C: Ditlhatlhobo tsa ka metlha tsa matlhapelo:**  The passage doesn't mention regular inspections.
*   **D: Tlhokomelo ya ABC:** ABC simply *reported* on the story; it doesn’t directly influence how seriously slaughterhouse workers treat animals.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, motho yo o neng a tshwarwa o ne a dira tiro efe?","The correct answer is **A: Moithuti (Student)**.

The text states: ""...moithuti yo mongwe yo neng a amana le go thuntsha tlhobolo kwa sekolong ka Mopitlwe 21, o tshwarwe."" This directly translates to ""...one student who was linked to the school shooting on April 21, was arrested.""



"
"Go ya ka serapa, fa go ntse go anamisiwa dikgang tsa go tshwarwa gape, go ne go tshwerwe diphitlho tsa batho ba le kae?","The correct answer is **C: Robongwe**.

The text states: ""...jaaka diphitlho tsa ga Jeff Weise le batswa-setlhabelo ba bararo mo go ba le robongwe di ne di tshwerwe...""  This directly translates to ""...as the searches of Jeff Weise and three suspects out of eight were conducted..."" 

Therefore, searches were conducted on a total of eight people.



"
Ke naga efe e e neng ya se ka ya tswelela pele ka tumalano ya yone ya ACTA e e neng ya saenwa ka ntlha ya ditshupetso?,"The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo kgweding e e fitileng go ne go na le bangongoregi ko Poland fa lefatshe leo le dumelana ka mokwalo le ACTA, se se ne sa gogela ko go reng puso ya Poland e tseye tshweetso go sa baakanya tumelano le gompieno."" This directly translates to: ""Last month there were protests in Poland as the country signed ACTA, which led to the Polish government suspending ratification of the agreement.""

This means Poland initially signed but *then* halted the agreement due to protests - effectively not proceeding with it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeremane (Germany)** - The text mentions protests *in* Germany, but doesn't state Germany reversed any agreement.
*   **C: Scotland** -  Scotland had protests, but it’s not mentioned that they were directly related to withdrawing from ACTA.
*   **D: Lithuania** - Lithuania is mentioned as a location where protests occurred, but not as a country that halted its agreement.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke efe ya dinaga tse di latelang e e neng ya swetsa ka gore e busetse morago thulaganyo ya go nna leloko la ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Latvia le Slovakia ka bobedi ba diile tsamaiso ya go inaakanya le ACTA."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia both rejected the ratification of ACTA."" 

The question asks which country *withdrew* from the ACTA arrangement, and Latvia is the only option listed that explicitly did so according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia** - The passage only mentions a protest in Tallinn, Estonia, not a withdrawal from ACTA.
*   **B: Lithuania** - The passage only mentions a protest in Vilnus, Lithuania, not a withdrawal from ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland** - The passage only mentions protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland, not a withdrawal from ACTA as a country.



"
Ke batho ba le kae ba ba neng ba gobala ka ntlha ya ditiragalo tsa go gotela ga di-iPod?,"The correct answer is **C: Borataro**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...di ne tsa tlhola melelo e ka nna thataro le go tlogela batho ba ka nna nne ka dikgobalo tse di seng masisi tsa molelo."" This translates to ""...they caused burns to approximately three people and left approximately four people with unspecified fire-related injuries.""

Therefore, approximately three people were burned.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a re ditiragalo tsa go gotela thata ga di masisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lephata la Itsholelo, Papadi le Madirelo la kwa Japane (METI) le buile fa le itse ka dikotsi di le masome a mabedi le bosupa (27) tse di amanngwang le didirisiwa tsa teng. Beke e e fitileng METI e anamisitse fa Apple e ba itsisitse ka ditiragalo tse dingwe tsa go gotela-phetelela tse di 34, tse komponi e di kaileng """"di se masisi."""" "" 

This directly says Apple labeled the overheating incidents as ""di se masisi"" (not serious).



"
"Ka nako ya puo ya gagwe, Steve Jobs o ne a re Apple e tlile go dira eng gape?","The correct answer is **D: Thekenoloji**.

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""Gompieno Apple e tlile go nchafatsa mosokelatsebeng. Re tlile go dira ditso gompieno.""  This translates to ""Today Apple has revolutionized the mobile phone. We have made discoveries today.""  ""Revolutionizing the mobile phone"" and ""making discoveries"" clearly relate to **technology** (Thekenoloji).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hisitori (History):** While the event *is* history, it's not what Jobs claimed Apple did.
* **B: Phounu (Phone):** He specifically said they revolutionized the *mobile phone* (mosokelatsebeng), but his statement was about their broader impact.
* **C: Setlamo (Fashion/Style):**  The statement doesn't mention anything about fashion or style.



"
Boikaelelo jwa puo ya diura tse pedi ya ga Steve Jobs e ne e le bofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Go ribolola founo e ntšhwa** (To unveil a new phone).

Here's why:

The text states Steve Jobs was unveiling the iPhone (""a bo a ntsha iPhone""). His quote, ""Today Apple has reinvented the phone,"" directly supports the idea that the purpose of the two-hour speech was to *introduce a new phone*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ribolola tablet e ntšhwa** (To unveil a new tablet) - The text specifically mentions the iPhone, not a tablet.
* **B: Go ribolola khomputara e ntšhwa** (To unveil a new computer) -  Again, the text focuses on the iPhone.
* **D: Go itsise gore o rola tiro ga gagwe** (To announce his retirement) - While Steve Jobs did eventually retire, this speech was about a product launch, not his retirement.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o ne a itsise eng kwa Theater ya Argentina?,"The correct answer is **B: Maitlhomo a gagwe a go batla go tlhophiwa go nna Senate**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Mohumagadi Kirchner o itsisitse ka maikaelelo a gagwe a go emela maemo a bo tautona kwa lefelo la bodiragatsi la Argentine...go nna leloko la Senate, e le moemedi wa porofense ya Buenos Aires."" This directly translates to Kirchner expressing her intentions to run for Senate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlhophiwa ga gagwe go nna moporesidente:** The passage doesn't mention a presidential bid.
*   **C: Letsholo la gagwe la kemedi ya porofense ya Buenos Aires:** While she *is* a representative of Buenos Aires, the passage focuses on her *intention to run for Senate*.
*   **D: Maikaelelo a gagwe a go tlogela go nna mosenatoro wa gone jaanong:** The passage indicates she wants to *become* a senator, not leave a current position.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner o ne a itsise kae gore o batla go tsenela bosole?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwa bo bogelong jwa Buenos Aires kwa La Plata**.

Here's why:

The passage states she announced her candidacy ""maabane maitseboa kwa La Plata, toropo e e sekgele sa dikhilomithara di le 50 (dimaele tse 31) go tswa kwa Buenos Aires."" This directly translates to ""in the province of Buenos Aires in La Plata"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions the distance *from* La Plata to Buenos Aires, not the other way around.
*   **C & D:** The passage doesn't mention a theater at all. It simply states the location as the city of La Plata.



"
ACMA e ne ya lemoga eng malebana le Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ne go sa tlolwa melao ya kanamiso kitso ya mo inthaneteng** (ACMA recognised that online content standards were not adhered to).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Big Brother e ne e sa tlola melao ya kanamiso kitso ya mo inthaneteng"" - meaning Big Brother did not follow online content standards. This is what ACMA recognized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states the *opposite* – information wasn't placed on the Big Brother website.
*   **C:** The passage doesn’t mention laws prohibiting specific actions.
*   **D:** The passage mentions the rules should be kept ""mo sefareng"" (in storage) but doesn't say the rules *were* in a different place.



"
Metswedi ya tshedimosetso e tshwanetse go nna le ditekanyetso dife gore e tsewe e le diteng tsa Inthanete?,"The correct answer is **A: E tshwanetse ya bo e le mo Inthaneteng** (It must be on the Internet).

Here's why:

The passage states the law ""neelana ka molawana wa diteng tsa Inthanete"" (relates to Internet content) and that it ""tshwanetse go tsewa e le diteng tsa Inthanete"" (must be considered Internet content).  This directly implies the content *must be on the Internet* to be classified as such.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E tshwanetse go nna mo sedirisiweng sengwe** (It must be on some device) -  Being *on* a device doesn't make it Internet content. It needs to be *accessible* via the internet.
* **C: Ga e ka ke ya bolokwa mo webosaeteng** (It cannot be stored on a website) - This is the opposite of what would be expected; Internet content is *typically* stored on websites/servers.
* **D: E tshwanetse go amogelwa ke ACMA** (It must be approved by ACMA) - While ACMA is mentioned, the passage doesn’t state approval is *required* for content to be classified as Internet content. It focuses on the *location* of the content (on the internet).



"
Ke mang moeteledipele wa Mokgatlho wa Liberal wa Australia?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The text states: ""...motshwaramatlotlo wa Australia, rre Peter Costello, gape e le rre yo a neng aka atlega go tlhatlhama Tonakgolo **John Howard** yo e leng moeteledipele wa lekoko la sepolitiki la Liberal..."" 

This translates to: ""...former Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, also a man who unsuccessfully challenged Prime Minister **John Howard** who was the leader of the Liberal political party...""
"
"""Ke ka ntlha yang fa Australia e ise e nne le madirelo a motlakase wa maranyane a """"nuclear""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Go tlhoka tshegetso ya setšhaba (Lack of public support)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Peter Costello believes Australia *should* pursue nuclear power if it's economically viable.  He points out there's no legal barrier.  The implication is that the reason it *hasn't* happened is due to a lack of public acceptance – a lack of ""tshegetso ya setšhaba.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go ganetsana thata (Strong opposition):** While there might be some opposition, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary reason.
* **C: Go kotsi thata (Very dangerous):** Costello doesn't mention safety concerns.
* **D: Go ja madi a mantsi thata (Very expensive):** Costello focuses on the economic *benefit* if nuclear power is pursued, not its cost.



"
Ke mothadisi ofe wa ski yo o neng a gaisana a thusiwa ke mokaedi?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Moreledi wa kapoko wa skiing, wa monna, wa kwa Poland, Maciej Krezel, le mokaedi wa gagwe, Anna Ogarzynska, ba feditse mo maemong a bolesome-le-boraro mo Super-G."" This means Maciej Krezel competed *with* his partner, Anna Ogarzynska.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - The text only mentions her finishing in a specific position, not competing with a partner.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** -  The text only mentions his finishing position.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** - While she is mentioned, the text states she is *assisting* Maciej Krezel, not the primary competitor."
Ke naga efe e e neng ya wetsa e le ya bolesome mo kgaisanong ya Super-G ya basadi ba ba emeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**. 

The text states: ""...le lefatshe la Finland ka Katja Saarinen a fetsa mo maemong a bolesome mo go yone kgaisano eo."" ( ...and the country of Finland with Katja Saarinen finishing in tenth place in that competition.)"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka Blake?","The correct answer is **C: O ne a dirisa thobane ka nako ya tlhaselo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states Blake was arrested for *attempting to pervert the course of justice* (go leka go sokamisa tsamaiso ya bosiamisi).** It doesn't say he used a weapon during the attack.  He *claimed* he used a shield to defend himself from bottles thrown at him, but that's his defense, not a confirmed fact about him using a weapon.

Let's look at why the other options are true, according to the text:

* **A: O ne a tshwarwa kwa lefelong la tiragalo:** The text explicitly states Blake was arrested at the scene.
* **B: O ne a dumela gore ke ene a mo tlhasetseng:**  The passage says the suspect *denied the attack* and claimed self-defense – implying he didn’t believe *he* was the attacker.
* **D: O ne a bolela gore go ne ga latlhelwa dibotlolo mo go ene:** The passage states he claimed bottles were thrown *at* him.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke eng se se latelang se se neng sa se ka sa diragalela Blake?","The correct answer is **D: O ne a bolelelwa gore gongwe o tla isiwa kgolegelong.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Moatlhodi o ne a bolelela Blake go re go ne """"go ne go batla go sa kgonege"""" go re a seka a romelwa kgolegelong.""  This directly translates to ""The magistrate told Blake that it was 'almost impossible' to prevent him from being sent to prison.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ne a bonwa molato wa go sokamisa tshiamiso** - While he *was* arrested for attempting to pervert the course of justice, the passage doesn't say he was *convicted* of it.
* **B: O ne a tshwarwa** - He was arrested, but the question asks about what was *going to happen* to him next.
* **C: O ne a tlhaselwa ka thobane** - The passage mentions an attack with a knife (Patwe 3), but it was *another person* who was attacked, not Blake.



"
Letlole la Lekgotla la Ditšhaba la go lwantsha go thuthafala ga lefatshe ga le kitla le dirisiwa go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go fokotsa ditlamorago tsa go thuthafala ga lefatshe** (To reduce the impacts of climate change).

Here's why:

The passage states the U.N. fund aims to help countries *deal with the impacts* of climate change by funding things like disaster-resistant housing, better water management, and diverse agriculture.  This directly aligns with reducing the negative *impacts* of climate change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dijalo tse di farologaneng** (Diverse crops) - While mentioned as *an example* of how the funds *could* be used, it's not the overall goal.
* **B: Go tlisetsa dinaga tse di tlhabologang maranyane** (Bringing money to developing countries) -  The fund is *for* developing countries, but the money isn't the goal itself; it's what the money *does*.
* **C: Matlo a a sa gogolweng ke metsi** (Flood-proof houses) -  Again, this is an *example* of a project the fund could support, not the overall purpose.



"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se Lekgotla la Ditšhaba le solofetseng go se boloka?","The correct answer is **A: Madi, ka go abelana maranyane.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lekgotla la U.N. le lone le solofela go feleleletsa go tlhangwa letlole la go thusa mafatshe a amilweng ke thuthafalo ya lefatshe.""  This directly translates to ""The U.N. assembly also pledged to contribute to creating a fund to help countries affected by climate change.""

Therefore, the U.N. is pledging money (a fund) to help.  The phrase ""ka go abelana maranyane"" (by sharing a little) reinforces that this is about contributing funds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dijalo (Crops):** The text mentions farming diverse crops *as something the money could be used for*, but isn't what the U.N. is pledging.
*   **C: Dikgwa tse di ratwang ke pula tse di setseng (Remaining rain-fed crops):** The text refers to conserving natural resources, not specifically crops.
*   **D: Batho ba ba amiwang ke go sa diriseng metsi sentle (People affected by improper water use):** While the text mentions improving water use, it doesn't say the U.N. is pledging *people* assistance, but rather a fund to help those affected by climate change.



"
Albert Muchanga o ne a sa umake eng mo go seno se se latelang jaaka sengwe se se neng se sa ntse se tlhoka go dumalanwa ka sone?,"The correct answer is **C: Melawana ya Tshimologo (Rules of Origin)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: *""Ga re ise re dumalane ka **melao ya tlhago le go fokoletswa lekgetho**, fela popego e re nang le yone e siame go re go ka simololwa kgwebisano ka kgwedi ya Phukwi a tlhola letsatsi 2020""*

This directly translates to ""We have not yet agreed on **rules of origin and tariff concessions**...""  Therefore, rules of origin were the outstanding issue Albert Muchanga mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa Benin e ka nna leloko la AfCTA (Whether Benin could be a member of AfCTA):** The passage states Benin *will* be a member, it's not an unresolved issue.
*   **B: Letlha le kgwebo e ka simololang ka lone (The date trade can begin):** The passage *mentions* a potential start date (July 2020), but doesn't say it's an issue needing agreement.
*   **D: Ditshiamelo tsa lekgetho (Tariff concessions):** While mentioned alongside rules of origin, the passage highlights both as *unresolved* issues, but the question asks what specifically Muchanga said they hadn't agreed upon.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke ka ntlha yang fa kgwebo e ka simolola ka kgwedi ya Phukwe?","The correct answer is **A: Letlha la go simolola la Phukwi e ne e le karolo ya maemo a Nigeria a go tsena mo AfCFTA**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “""...popego e re nang le yone e siame go re go ka simololwa kgwebisano ka kgwedi ya Phukwi a tlhola letsatsi 2020"""".” This directly links the February start date to Nigeria's commitment to joining the AfCFTA.  The passage implies the start date was tied to Nigeria's ratification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go na le melao ya tlhago:** The passage specifically states they *haven't* agreed on rules of origin.
*   **C: E ne ya amogelwa ke mokomišenara wa kgwebo le madirelo wa AU:** While the commissioner mentioned the date, it wasn't simply his acceptance that caused it, but Nigeria's conditions.
*   **D: Go dumalanwe ka melao ya tshimologo le ditshiamelo tsa lekgetho:** The passage states the opposite - they haven't agreed on these rules yet.

"Go ya ka serapa, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution e ne ya latofatsa badiredibagolo ba thuto ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go se tseye kgato malebana le mathata a ka fa gare a a lemogilweng**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's investigation revealed problems with test scores and that the school system was accused of *not taking action* on the identified issues (""sa seke sa tsaya matsapa ape""). This directly reflects a failure to address internal problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go fetola pego ya Journal-Constitution:** The paragraph does not say the Atlanta Journal-Constitution changed a report. It says the paper *published* a report showing problems.
*   **B: Go palelwa ke go dira diphetogo mo thutong ya setoropo:** While Hall was praised for changes to education, the report focuses on the negative consequences of those changes and the cover-up.
*   **D: Go bega maduo a a kwa tlase a tlhatlhobo:** The paragraph states the test papers were *altered* (""di ne di kgotlelesegile""), not that low scores were reported."
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo serapeng, ke eng se se neng se sa umakiwe mo pegong ya Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Bosupi jwa gore dipampiri tsa tlhatlhobo di ne di fetotswe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bosupi jo bo bonweng morago, bo ne bo kaa fa dipampiri tsa tlhatlhobo di ne di kgotlelesegile"" (Later evidence revealed that test papers had been altered). The Atlanta Journal-Constitution report revealed issues with test results, and this evidence of altered papers was *found* within that investigation - it wasn't part of the initial report itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go tokafala e kgolo mo dintlheng tsa thuto (Significant gains in test scores):** This was *a result* discussed in the passage, but not what the report revealed. It was what Hall was initially praised for.
* **C: Mofenyi wa 2009 wa National Superintendent of the Year (2009 National Superintendent of the Year award):** This is a fact stated in the passage, not something the report uncovered.
* **D: Ditshitshinyo tsa go tlhabolola thuto ya ditoropo (Efforts to improve urban education):** This is a broader topic, and while relevant to Hall's work, it isn't specifically what the report detailed.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke tshedimosetso efe e e itsiweng morago ga go thuntshiwa ga bomo?","The correct answer is **A: Palo ya bofelo ya dikgobalo (The final number of casualties)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mme gone palo ya makgaolakgang ga ise e itsiwe"" (and the number of victims is not yet known).  The question asks what information is *known* after the shootings.  The passage *does* mention an estimated number of people present (30), which relates to potential casualties.  Therefore, determining the final number of casualties is the key piece of information being sought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dibomo di ne tsa thunya gaufi le dikago dife? (Which cages were the shootings near?)** - The passage says ""dikago tsa puso"" (government buildings) but doesn't specify *which* ones.
* **C: Fa dibomo tse dingwe di ne di ka thunya (If other shootings occurred)** - The passage only reports on the initial shooting and the three subsequent ones.
* **D: Palo ya batho ba ba suleng (The number of injured people)** -  The passage doesn't mention any injuries, only casualties (makgaolakgang which can mean victims or deceased).



"
"Fa e sale a tsena mo Manchester City ka 2017, Jesus o tshamekile metshameko e le kae?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Jesus wa dingwaga di le 21 o tsene mo setlhopeng sa Manchester City ngwaga o fetileng ka January 2017...mo-Borasili yono o tshameketse setlhopha sa teng mo metsamekong e le masome a matlhano le boraro (53) mo dikgaisanong tsotlhe."" This directly answers the question."
Jesu o ne a amogela madi a a kana ka diranta di le dimilione di le 27 gore a nne leloko la setlhopha sefe?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The passage states Jesus joined Manchester City from Palmeiras for £27 million. The question asks which team he became a member of *after* receiving the money.
"
Ke polelo efe e e seng boammaaruri ka baeng ba lefelo la bonno?,"The correct answer is **D: Bontsi jwa baeng ba ne ba tswa kwa motseng o o boitshepo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *most* of the passengers were from the United Arab Emirates, **not** from Mecca itself (the holy city). 

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Baeng ba ne ba le kwa Mecca go ya go dira boikhutso** - The passage says they were going to Mecca to begin their Hajj pilgrimage which is an act of religious devotion.
*   **B: Baeng bangwe e ne e se baagi ba selegae** - This is true as they came from the United Arab Emirates.
*   **C: Baeng ba ne ba le koo mo letsatsi pele ga hajj** - The text explicitly states they arrived the day before the Hajj.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **B: Bontsi jwa baeng ba ne ba tswa kwa United Arab Emirates**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states: ""Bontsi jwa baeti ba hosetele e ne e le baagi ba United Arab Emirates."" (The majority of the hotel guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Palo ya baswi e ka tshwara 15.** While the text mentions the hotel can hold 15+, it doesn't state it *currently* holds 15.
*   **C: Baeng ba ne ba le koo mo maitseboeng a boikhutso jwa Hajj** The text states they were *preparing* to take the pilgrimage, not that they were *in* the Hajj rituals.
*   **D: Bontsi jwa baeng e ne e le batho ba selegae Mecca** The text explicitly says the majority were from the United Arab Emirates, not local to Mecca.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke tshedimosetso efe e e ka ikanngwang malebana le go thulana ga dikoloi tseno?","The correct answer is **C: Ditlamorago tsa go thulana ga tsone mo Lefatsheng (The impacts of their impact on Earth)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions scientists trying to **""sekaseka go re kotsi e e diragetseng e ne e le bogolo jo bo kae, le go re Lefatshe le tsile go amega jang""** (calculate how big the disaster was and how Earth was affected). This directly relates to the effects of the impact on Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bogolo jwa thulo (Size of the impact)** - While the passage mentions the weight (over 1,000 pounds) and speed, it's focused on the *results* of the impact, not just the size.
*   **B: Lefelo le go thulaneng ka lone (Location of impact)** - The passage states they are searching for debris ""mo maranyaneng a botlhe"" (in all oceans), but doesn't specify *where* the impact actually happened.
*   **D: Lefelo le matlakala a leng mo go lone (Location of the debris)** - The passage does mention debris being collected, but the focus isn't on the debris' location as much as the investigation into the impact itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke eng se se sa ntseng se tshwanetse go tlhomamisiwa malebana le go thulana ga tsone?","The correct answer is **D: Bogolo jwa thoromo ya lefatshe**

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ba sa leka go sekaseka go re kotsi e e diragetseng e ne e le bogolo jo bo kae, le go re Lefatshe le tsile go amega jang."" This directly translates to ""They are trying to determine how big the disaster was and how the Earth was impacted."" 

The passage highlights that scientists are still working to understand the *extent* of the impact on Earth. The other options are mentioned in the passage, but aren't things that *need to be determined* - they are either facts already stated (speed of the meteoroids, who is investigating) or logistical details (how samples will be shared).



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, Batten o kile a nna kae mo lenaaneng la Maamerika a a humileng thata?","The correct answer is **C: ya bo190**.

The text states: ""Batten o ne a le mo maemong a bo-190 mo lenaaneng la 2008 la ma-Amerika a le 400 a a humileng go gaisa..."" This directly tells us his ranking was 190th."
Batten o ne a ntsha moneelo mo go ofe wa ba ba latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Yunibesithi ya Virginia**.

The passage states that Batten ""abated to the institution generously"" after graduating from the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Virginia. This means he donated money to the University of Virginia.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lenaane la Maamerika a a humileng go gaisa (Forbes 400 list):** He was *on* the list, not donating to it.
*   **C: Setheo seo go le gontsi (That institution):** This is vague and doesn't specify where the money went.
*   **D: Kholejeng ya Botaki le Maranyane (College of Arts and Sciences):** While he graduated from there, the passage states he donated to the *institution* (the University) generally.



"
Ke eng se se seng karolo ya molaotlhomo o o saenilweng ke Molaodi Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **A: Go thibelwa ga go rekisiwa kana go hirisiwa ga metshameko ya dibidio e e nang le tirisodikgoka mo baneng mo California yotlhe**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Molaotlhomo wa California Arnold Schwarzenegger saenile molaotlhomo go o dira molao o o itsang go rekisediwa kana go rentisediwa ga bana metshameko ya dibidio e e nang le tirisodikgoka."" This directly translates to prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors in California.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kotlhao ya madi go ya ka molato mongwe le mongwe.** - While the passage *mentions* a fine, it's a *result* of violating the law, not the law itself.
* **C: Go thibelwa ga go rekisiwa kana go hirisiwa ga metshameko ya dibidio e e nang le tirisodikgoka mo baneng ba ba kwa ntle ga California** - The law applies *within* California, not to people outside the state.
* **D: ""Go tlhokega gore metshameko ya thubakanyo e nne le letshwao le mokwalo o o reng """"18"""".sekgomaretsi""** - The passage states the games need an ""18"" label, but the core of the law is the *prohibition* of sale/rental to minors.  The label is a requirement *to enforce* that prohibition.



"
"Go ya ka temana eno, ke mang yo o neng a sa utlwe se se neng se buiwa?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fa a kopiwa tshwaelo, Miller o rile, """"Mike o bua thata mo tshekong... Ke ne ke sentse ke ipaakanya, ke jalo tota ga ke a utlwa se a neng a se bua."""""". This directly translates to: ""When asked for comment, Miller said, 'Mike speaks harshly in the court... I was already zoning out, so I didn't actually hear what he was saying.'""

Therefore, Miller is the one who admits to not hearing what was said."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a boammaaruri malebana le se se neng sa diragalela Miller kwa tshekong?","The correct answer is **B: O ne a sa tlhwaya tsebe fa a ntse a ipaakanya.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Miller o rile, """"Mike o bua thata mo tshekong... Ke ne ke sentse ke ipaakanya, ke jalo tota ga ke a utlwa se a neng a se bua."""""" This directly translates to ""Miller said, 'Mike was speaking loudly at the trial... I was already dizzy, so I didn't hear what he was saying.'""  This means Miller was disoriented and couldn't clearly hear what Duvall said.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duvall o ne a kgatlha Miller ka nako ya tsheko** - The passage says Duvall was *challenging* Miller, not necessarily yelling at him.  ""Kgatlha"" means to challenge or question.
* **C: Bana ba ga Duvall ba babedi ba ne ba bua thata ka nako ya tsheko** - The passage doesn't mention Duvall's children speaking at the trial.
* **D: O ne a reetsa kgang ya ga Duvall ka kelotlhoko** - The passage doesn't suggest Miller responded with sympathy to Duvall's lineage.

Ke mang yo o neng a tshitshinya gore go fetolwe ‘Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text states: ""Layton o ile a kopa diphetogo di dirwe mo molawaneng wa go tlhokomela tikologo..."" which translates to ""Layton asked for changes to be made to the Clean Air Act...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: John Howard** - He was defending forestry interests, not asking for changes to the Clean Air Act.
* **B: Lekoko la Balebedi** - This option doesn't appear in the text and is irrelevant.
* **D: Stephen Harper** - He *received* the request for changes, he didn't *make* it.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a ganetsa gore ‘Molao wa Phefo e e Phepa’ o ne o dirisiwa jaaka motshameko wa pele ga ditlhopho?,"The correct answer is **B: Tonakgolo** (Prime Minister).

Here's why:

The text states ""Mme Tonakgolo John Howard a re se ke go sireletsa fela ditheo tsa bookelo go re di se ka tsa isiwa kwa tlase ke puso ya Tasmania...""  This directly indicates the Prime Minister (Tonakgolo) was the one resisting the use of the 'Clean Air Act' as leverage in the dispute.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Modiredi wa puso ya naga** - The text doesn't mention a land government administrator resisting this.
*   **C: Moeteledipele wa NDP** - Jack Layton (leader of the NDP) was *asking* for changes to the environmental law, not resisting its use as a bargaining chip.
*   **D: Mopalamente** - While other parliament members were involved, the quote specifically names the Prime Minister as the one making the statement about not allowing the law to be undermined."
Dikhemikale tsa cyanuric acid le melamine di ne tsa bopiwa ke eng fa di ne di dirisana mmogo mo motlhapeng wa katse?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikhiristale** (Crystals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Babatisisi ba lemogile fa go bopega **makgabananyana** mo morotong wa dikatse ka go tsenya melamine le cyanuric acid.""  ""Makgabananyana"" translates to crystals. The passage further mentions the crystals formed were similar to those found in the kidneys of affected animals and were identified using FTIR spectroscopy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diphilo** - While the passage mentions the impact on kidney function, it doesn't say the chemicals *are* kidneys.
*   **B: Dijo tsa diruiwa** - The chemicals were found *in* the kidneys after consuming contaminated food, but weren't formed *by* the food itself.
*   **D: Thekenoloji ya go leba dilo ka marang a a tseneletseng** - FTIR is a method of *identifying* the crystals, not what they are.



"
Babatlisisi ba ne ba dirisa thekenoloji ya infrared spectroscopy go bona eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Seelo sa dikhiristale mo motlhapeng wa diphologolo** (The structure of crystals in the animal kidneys).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sebopego sa mekakwa eno se tshwana le e e fitlhetsweng mo motlhapologong wa diphologolo tse di amegileng fa e bapisiwa go dirisiwa infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""  This directly translates to ""The structure of these crystals was the same as that found in the kidneys of affected animals when compared using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Therefore, FTIR was used to identify and compare the crystal structures found in the samples with those in affected animal kidneys.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tiro ya diphilo** (Animal health) - While the study relates to animal health, FTIR wasn't used to measure health directly.
*   **C: Diphologolo tsa mo gae tse di amilweng** (Domestic animals that are affected) - FTIR was used to analyze *what* was affecting the animals, not identify the animals themselves.
*   **D: Dijo tse di kgotletsweng tsa diruiwa** (Dog food) - The passage says the samples came from animal *urine* after eating the food, not the food itself. FTIR was not used to analyze the food."
"""Ke mang yo o neng a bitsa Luna a re ke """"Mohumagadi wa ntlha  yo o Feteletseng""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer o ne a re """"Luna e ne e le Mohumagadi wa ntlha yo o Feteletseng."""" 

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna ""Mohumagadi wa ntlha yo o Feteletseng""."
"""Ke mang yo o neng a bitsa Luna a re o  """"popota""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states: ""Tommy Dreamer o ne a re """"Luna e ne e le Mohumagadi wa ntlha yo o Feteletseng. Motsamaisi wa mewa ntlha. Luna o tlhokafetse mo bosigong jwa ngwedi tse pedi. Seo se ne se farologane tota fela jaaka ene. **Mosadi yo o popota.**"""" "" 

This clearly shows Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna ""popota"" (stubborn/difficult)."
Ke eng se se neng sa se ka sa diragalela mokgweetsi yo o neng a amega mo kotsing?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a gobetse mo tlhogong** (He was injured in the head).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Mme, mokgweetsi o ne a bona dikgobalo tse di masisi mo tlhogong"" (But, the driver saw serious injuries to the head). This directly answers the question of what happened to the driver in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga a ka a gobatsa ope mo ntlong** (He didn't save anyone in the house) - The passage states no one was saved, but this isn't *what happened to the driver*.
* **C: O ne a fudusiwa go tswa kwa bookelong jwa kwa Cambridge a isiwa kwa go jo bo kwa Great Yarmouth** (He was transferred from the hospital in Cambridge to one in Great Yarmouth) - This describes *where* he was treated, not what *happened* to him in the accident.
* **D: Badiredi ba namolo ba ne ba mo thusa go tswa mo koloing ya gagwe** (Paramedics helped him out of his car) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Ke eng se se neng se sa tlhomologe mo motshamekong wa Afrika Borwa wa motshameko wa rugby?,"The correct answer is **A: Tiro e e kgatlhang ya setlhopha (The strong team effort)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Go itshwara sentle ga basireletsi, kitso ya go tshwara bolo ka matsetseleko, le go dirisana sentle ga batshameki, go dirile go re ba ikgethe mo go ba bangwe...""  This highlights that the *combined effort* and teamwork were what made South Africa stand out and were considered something to bet on. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kitso ya go tshwara bolo ka matsetseleko (Knowledge of catching the ball with hands):** This is *part* of their success, but not the overall thing that was notable.
* **C: Ba simolotse sentle, ba fenya motlhofo (They started well, winning the game):**  Winning is a result of their effort, not the effort itself.
* **D: Bokgoni jwa go itshireletsa (Defensive skill):** This is *also* a part of their success, but again, not the defining, comprehensive element that the passage emphasizes.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, motshameko wa Afrika Borwa o simolotse leng go tokafala?","The correct answer is **D: Fa kgaisano e ntse e tsweletse** (As the match progressed).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ene ya tokafala fa motshameko o ntse o tsweletse."" which directly translates to ""...it started to falter as the match progressed."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mo e ka nnang ka 10:00 mo mosong** - The match *started* at 10:00, but didn't tokafala then.
*   **B: Go itshwara sentle ga basireletsi** - This describes a *strength* of the team, not when they started to falter.
*   **C: Morago ga go fenngwa ke Zambia** -  South Africa *won* against Zambia, they weren't defeated.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Fa e sa le nako eo, itsholelo ya lefatshe la China e godile ka seelo sa ga 90. E le la ntlha, ngwaga o o fetileng China e rekiseditse mafatshe a sele dikoloi tse dintsi go feta Jeremane..."" This directly contradicts option D. The passage *confirms* China *did* surpass Germany in car exports.

Let's look at why the other options are good representations of China's economic growth:

*   **A: Itsholelo ya China e ile ya gola ka bofefo morago ga go dirwa diphetogo:** The passage mentions Deng Xiaoping's reforms initiated economic growth (""Mananeo a ntlha a go tlhabolola itsholelo a dirilwe ka fa tlase ga boeteledipele jwa ga Deng Xiaoping"") and states the economy grew at a rate of 90%.
*   **B: China e na le mmaraka o mogolo wa go romela ntle dikoloi go feta United States:** The passage directly states China exported more cars than Germany and is becoming a leading trade market.
*   **C: Kgabagare China e ka nna ya nna le selekanyetso sa itsholelo sa GDP se se fetang sa United States:** The passage predicts China's GDP could surpass the US in the next two decades.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke leng GDP ya China e ka fetang ya United States?","The correct answer is **B: Mo masomeng a mabedi a dingwaga**.

The passage states: ""GDP ya China e ka nna ya feta ya Amerika mo dingwageng tse di masome a mabedi tse di tlang.""  This directly translates to ""China's GDP could surpass that of the United States in the next two decades.""
"
Hu o ne a akantsha gore dinaga tse di tlhabologang di dire eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go tila ditsela tsa bogologolo tsa kgotlelo.**

Here's why:

The passage states Hu Jintao urged developed countries to ""stop the historical practice of pollution first and address it later."" This directly translates to abandoning the old ways of polluting to achieve growth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go dira dilo tse di tla ba thusang gore ba gole sentle** - While growth is implied, the focus is on *how* they grow, not just growing.
* **B: Go tlhoma mogopolo mo go ntsheng madi** - The passage doesn't mention fundraising or ideas about money.
* **C: Go dira ditiro tse di fetang tse ba di dirang gone jaanong** -  The passage argues they should change *what* they do, not just do *more* of it.



"
Ke eng se Hu a neng a sa se umaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Letlha le ka lone go solofetsweng gore dikhemikale tsa khabone di tla fokotsega ka**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""O ne a se ke a bua selekanyo sa go re ba tla kgaola ka bokae..."" which translates to ""He did not state by how much emissions would be reduced.""  This directly indicates he didn't reveal a specific target for carbon dioxide reduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Motheo wa go fokotsa** (The basis of reduction) - The passage does mention a basis (starting from 2005 levels), so it wasn't left unmentioned.
*   **B: Kgakololo go dinaga tse di tlhabologang malebana le kgotlelo** (Reminder to developing countries regarding emissions) - He *did* address this, urging them to ""stop the practice of developing first and then remedying.""
*   **D: Palo ya dipalopalo tsa go fokotsa go ntshiwa ga khabone** (Number of emission reduction policies) - The passage doesn’t focus on the *number* of policies, but the *amount* of reduction.



"
Veerman o ne a re boemo ga bo a siama mo go efe ya dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Richard Veerman O rile: ”Angola e mo tseleng ya go runya ga ntwa go go masisi go gaisa mme seemo se tswela pele go nna maswe thata kwa Angola”.""  This translates to ""Richard Veerman said: “Angola is on the path to a worsening war situation and the situation continues to be very difficult *in Angola*.”""

Veerman is specifically commenting on the deteriorating situation *in Angola*. The other options are organizations or a location within Angola, but the statement focuses on the overall state of **Angola** itself.



"
"Ka ntlha ya tatofatso, ke mang yo o tla tsayang maemo a ga Huhne mo Kabineteng?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Huhne o rotse tiro mme o tla emisediwa ke Ed Davey MP mo Kabineteng. Norman Lamb MP o lebeletswe go re a tseye tiro ya Tona ya tsa Kgwebo e Davey a e tlogelang."" 

This translates to: ""Huhne resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP in the Cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the position of Secretary of State for Business that Davey is leaving.""

Therefore, Norman Lamb is the one expected to take over Huhne's position (the position Davey is leaving *because* he's taking over Huhne's).



"
Ke mang yo o tla nnang Tona ya Kgwebo morago ga go sekisiwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP o lebeletswe go re a tseye tiro ya Tona ya tsa Kgwebo e Davey a e tlogelang."" This directly translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the role of Secretary of State for Business that Davey is leaving.""



"
Batshameki ba rotloetsa bareetsi go dira eng ka nako ya opera ya ga Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba kopanele mo seraleng go tla go bona tiragalo eno** (They gather in the garden to witness this event).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""badiragatsi ba goga cannabis mo seraleng, mme bobogelo ka bojone bo kgothaletsa babogedi go tsaya karolo."" (artists smoke cannabis in the garden, and the scent encourages spectators to participate). This directly implies people *gather in the garden* to be part of the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nna le seabe mo go gogeng cannabis.** (Have a reason to smoke cannabis) - While cannabis is mentioned, the passage doesn't *instruct* the audience to smoke it, just that it happens and attracts others.
* **B: Tsaya loeto go ya Japane** (Take a trip to Japan) - The passage mentions Saint-Saens' interest in Japan, but doesn't suggest the audience should travel there.
* **D: Letla gore botshelo jwa bone bo laolwe ke se ba se ratang** (Let their lives be governed by what they love) - This is a philosophical statement and not related to the specifics of attending the opera.



"
Ke mang yo gantsi a gogang disekerete ka nako ya opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Badiragatsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""badiragatsi ba goga cannabis mo seraleng..."" which translates to ""composers smoke cannabis in the salon..."" This directly links composers to the act of smoking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Modiragatsi:** While Camille Saint-Saens is a composer, the passage specifically says *composers* generally smoke cannabis.
*   **B: Badiragatsi ba Bafora:** The passage doesn't limit the composers to being French.
*   **D: Camille Saint-Saens:** The passage uses Saint-Saens as an example, but doesn't say *he* generally smokes cannabis.



"
"""Leina le lengwe la """"spacewalk"""" e Leonov a neng a e dira ke lefe?""","The correct answer is **C: Go tsamaya mo lefaufaung, a le kwa ntle ga sesutlhalefaufau.**

The passage specifically states: ""Ka kgwedi ya Tlhakole 18, 1965, o ne a dira tiro ya gagwe ya ntlha ya mosutlhalefaufau, kgotsa **""""go tsamaya mo lefaufaung""""**, a le kwa ntle ga sesutlhalefaufau a le nosi metsotso e feta fela e le lesome-le-bobedi.""  This directly defines what his spacewalk was called.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tiro ya Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a later mission he *led*, not the name of his first spacewalk.
*   **B: Go Gaisana mo Lefaufaung:** This isn't mentioned in the text as a name for a spacewalk.
*   **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is a designation, not the name of the spacewalk itself.



"
Leonov o ne a eteletse pele karolo ya Soviet ya thomo efe?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Dingwaga di le lesome moragonyana, o ne a etelela pele setlhopha sa Soviet sa Apollo–letsholo la Soyuz...""  This directly states Leonov led the Soviet side of the Apollo-Soyuz mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go Gaisana mo Lefaufaung (Space Travel):** This is a general topic, not a specific mission Leonov led.
* **C: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is a designation, not a mission.
* **D: EVA (Extravehicular Activity):** While Leonov was the first to perform a spacewalk (EVA), he didn't *lead* a mission solely focused on that. He led the Soviet side of Apollo-Soyuz later in his career.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a gobala mo kotsing?,"The correct answer is **D: Mokgweetsi wa lori**.

The passage states: ""Mokgweetsi wa dilori, yo o nang le dingwaga tse 64, o ne a seka a gobala mo kotsing."" This directly translates to ""The truck driver, who is 64 years old, failed to brake in the accident.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gibson** - Gibson was *involved* in the accident as a pedestrian, but didn't cause it.
*   **B: Modiri wa karatšhe** - The passage mentions a car mechanic nearby, but doesn't say they were driving.
*   **C: Bana** - The children were *trying* to cross the road, but were not driving and therefore didn't cause the accident.



"
Go ne ga direga eng ka batho ba ba neng ba amega mo kotsing eo?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo mongwe o ne a sa gobala, yo mongwe o ne a swa**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""Gibson one a sianisetswa kwa kokelong morago ga kotsi, mme one a tlokafafala fa a sena go fitlha mo boekelong."" This means Gibson was injured and didn't make it to the hospital - implying he died.
* The text also states ""Mokgweetsi wa dilori, yo o nang le dingwaga tse 64, o ne a seka a gobala mo kotsing."" This means the truck driver did *not* survive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Boobabedi ba ne ba swa:** While one person died, the text implies Gibson was injured and didn't make it to the hospital.
* **C: Ba ne ba goa e bile ba lela:** This refers to the children who witnessed the accident, not those directly involved.
* **D: Bobedi jwa bone ba gobetse:** The text says the truck driver did *not* survive.



"
Baitsesaense ba ba neng ba dira ka thulaganyo eno ba ne ba solofetse go bona ditlamorago tse di bakwang ke dife tsa dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Dikarolwana tse dinnye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maduo a setlhopha se neng se a solofetse a ka dirwa ke makhubu a magolo thata magareng ga bosagaripa jo bontsho mo loaping le losagaripa lo lo lefifi lwa molalatladi...se dirwa ke dikarolwana tse dinnye di le dintsi.""

This directly translates to: ""The predictions of the group could be made by large bumps between the dark matter in the halo and the dark matter in the galaxy...caused by numerous small particles.""

Therefore, the scientists were hoping to observe effects caused by **small particles** (Dikarolwana tse dinnye).



"
Baitsesaense ba ne ba ela tlhoko kgang efe ya dilo tse di latelang?,"The correct answer is **D: Losagaripa lwa Sagittarius le Molala wa Tladi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Losagaripa lwa Molalatladi (the center of the galaxy):**  ""...magareng ga bosagaripa jo bontsho mo loaping le losagaripa lo lo lefifi lwa molalatladi.""
    * **Losagaripa lwa Sagittarius:** ""...thulaganyo e kwaletswe go rotloetsa di ponatshegotsamagodimo a Sagittarius."" and ""...Milky Way le yone e dira kgatelelo kwa lesagareng la dinaleldi la Sagittarius.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Losagaripa Lwa Molala wa Tladi le Ngwedi:** While the moon is mentioned for comparison (its gravitational pull), it's not a primary focus of the observation.
* **B: Lefatshe le losagaripa lwa Sagittarius:** Earth is only mentioned in the analogy of the moon's gravity, not as a direct observation.
* **C: Lefatshe le Ngwedi:**  Same as B, they are used for comparison, not the core observation.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se batho ba ba sa rateng go fetoga ga polotiki ba sa se kgaleng?","The correct answer is **A: Madi a go thusa (Aid money)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some donors expressed concerns, framing it as ""Bush's New Orleans Deal."" The relaxed oversight mentioned refers to how contracts were being awarded, implying concerns about where the *aid money* was going and who was benefiting from it.  The text directly links the criticism to concerns about the use of funds intended for those affected by Katrina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlhoka maiteko a go tsosolosa (Lack of rebuilding efforts):** While rebuilding was certainly a problem, the passage focuses specifically on the *money* and how it was being distributed.
* **C: Ba ba abelwang dikonteraka tsa kago seša (People awarded contracts):** The passage suggests that *how* the contracts were awarded was the issue, not necessarily the people receiving them. The focus is on the lack of oversight.
* **D: Ditshenyegelo tsa go aga seša (Costs of rebuilding):**  Similar to B, the passage doesn't directly criticize the cost of rebuilding, but rather the handling of the funds.



"
Ke mang yo o tshwayang dikonteraka tsa go tsosolosa tiro ya go namola ba ba amilweng ke Setsuatsue sa Katrina diphoso?,"The correct answer is **B: Baitlhaodi**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Kgakololo e e phuthulogileng e remeletse thata mo go matswela a borra dikonteraka go re e bonwe ke baagi ba Washington."" This translates to ""A relaxed audit strongly suggested that contracts were awarded to benefit Washington insiders.""  ""Baagi ba Washington"" here refers to people connected to Washington, which strongly points to **Baitlhaodi (Contractors)** receiving the contracts improperly. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba ba Tlhokomelang Ditshenyegelo Tsa Madi (Fund Oversight):** While they might *investigate* the issues, they aren't the ones *receiving* the contracts.
*   **C: Bush:**  The passage references a ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" suggesting involvement, but it's the awarding of contracts, not Bush himself, that's the problem highlighted.
*   **D: Batho ba ba mo teng ga Washington (People in Washington):** This is too broad. It's the *contractors* who directly benefit.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, dipone tsa sekepe sa Stardust di tla bonala kae pele?","The correct answer is **B: Bokone jwa California**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Se se ka tsamaela kwa ditshitshing tsa bophirima jwa bokone jwa California..."""" This directly indicates that the Stardust meteor shower will be visible first in Northern California.

While the meteor will also be visible in other states (Oregon, Nevada, Utah, and Idaho), the text specifically highlights Northern California as the initial point of visibility.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, sejanaga seno sa lefaufau se tla tlhoma rekoto ya eng mo go tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go boela mo Lefatsheng ka bonako**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stardust e tla baya nako e ncha e e khutshwane go fetisa, ya sesutlhalefaufau go boela mo Lefatsheng, e phala nako e e sa bolong go bewa ke Apollo X ka Motsheganong wa 1969."" This directly says Stardust will set a new record for returning to Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go phatsimisa loapi** - While the passage mentions it will illuminate the sky, it doesn't say it's a *record* for illuminating the sky.
*   **B: Go bonala mo metseng e mentsi** - The passage describes where it will be *visible*, but not that it's a record for visibility in many cities.
*   **D: Go tsamaya go tswa kwa San Francisco go ya kwa Los Angeles ka bonako go gaisa** - This is a description of its *speed*, not a record it's breaking.



"
Go ne go ntse jang Dr. A Malar Balasubramanian o amana le Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmè**.

The text states: ""Ngaka Malar Balasubramanian o tla lebisiwa molato wa polao a dirisa dikgoka morago ga go re **mmaagwe** a fitlhelwe a tlhokafetse mo buting ya koloi ya gagwe..."" 

""Mmè"" translates to ""mother"" in English. Therefore, Dr. Malar Balasubramanian is the son of Saroja Balasubramanian.



"
Mmele wa ga Sara Balasubramanian o ne wa fitlhelwa kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo teng ga koloi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ba bone mmele wa ga Saroja Balsubramniam, 53 o apesitswe ka kobo e e nang le dikolo tsa madi. Mapodise a re go lebega mmele o ne o sale o nna foo letsatsi lotlhe.""  This directly implies the body was found *in* the car (Oldsmobile Intrigue ya gagwe e ntsho).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwa Cincinnati:** While Blue Ash (where the doctor was found) is near Cincinnati, the body was specifically found *in the car*, not just in the city.
*   **B: Go bapa le tsela:** The doctor was found *near* the road, but the body was in the car.
*   **D: Kwa Pittsburgh:** The story mentions Pittsburgh as the doctor's workplace, but the body was found in Ohio.



"
eBay e ne ya reka eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The text states that the company *wants to make it difficult for eBay to identify its sources and operate in regions where Skype holds a strong position*. This clearly indicates eBay acquired Skype."
eBay e batla go fitlhelela eng ka go reka?,"The correct answer is **B: Go atolosa kwa re nang le kemedi teng**.

Here's why:

The passage states the company wants ""to have a variety of sources of supply and make it difficult to be noticed in areas where Skype is dominant, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil."" This directly indicates an intention to **expand into markets where they currently don't have a strong presence (or are struggling)** to compete with Skype.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nonotsha lotseno lwa yone:** The passage doesn't mention improving efficiency.
* **C: Dira gore e bonwe ke batho:** While brand recognition is important, the passage focuses on penetrating *specific* markets where they're currently at a disadvantage.
* **D: Kgotsofatsa bana-le-seabe:** This isn't mentioned at all.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a sa kopane le magolegwa a a neng a sala mo jarateng morago ga ntwa?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhopha tsa bafalodi ba molelo** (Firefighters).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go ise go e kae, mapodise a a tlametsweng ka didiriswa tsa twantsho ya dikhuduego, ba ne ba tsena mo jarateng, ba kgorogela bagolegwa ka gase e e tshololang dikeledi. Ba setima molelo ba ne kwa bofelong ba kgona go tima molelo ka 11.35 bosigo.""

This clearly indicates that *firefighters* (bafalodi ba molelo) were the ones who entered the building and dealt with the situation after the initial conflict, meaning they were the ones who encountered the remaining captives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Babueledi** (Translators) - The passage doesn't mention translators being involved in the aftermath.
*   **C: Batlhankedi** (Detectives) - While police were involved, the passage focuses on firefighters extinguishing the fire and reaching the captives.
*   **D: Badiri ba kwa bookelong** (Bookstore employees) - They were the initial captives, not the ones encountering the remaining ones.



"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se kgabagare se neng sa dira gore magolegwa a boele morago mo dikhuduegong?,"The correct answer is **B: Gase e e gogelang** (The intoxicating gas).

Here's why:

The passage states that police entered the building and ""overpowered the hostage-takers with an intoxicating gas."" This directly caused the hostage-takers to be subdued and likely return to a state of being controlled (back into custody/the situation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dipuisano Tse di Atlegileng** (Successful negotiations) - The passage says negotiations *failed* to fully resolve the situation.
*   **C: Magolegwa a mangwe a a gobetseng** (Other captured hostage-takers) - This doesn't explain why the original hostage-takers were subdued.
*   **D: Molelo** (Fire) - The fire was a result of the situation, not a cause of the hostage-takers being overcome. They eventually extinguished it.



"
"Go ya ka pono ya ga Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, naga ya Iran e tshwanetse go gololesega mo go eng?","The correct answer is **D: Go ikaega ka oli**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, o tlhalositse gore go ikaega thata ka leokwaneng ke ”serai” sa pele ga phetogo ya Iselamo ya Iran ka 1979 le se naga e tshwanetseng ya ikgolola mo go sone.""

This translates to: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei explained that reliance on oil is 'the basis' of the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran and what the country should liberate itself from."" 

Therefore, Khamenei believes Iran needs to free itself from dependence on oil."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a dumela gore kgaosetso-dipapadisanyo e ama itsholelo ya Iran?","The correct answer is **A: Metswedi e megolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dikakgelo, tse di neng di supiwa mo thelebisheneng, e ne e e la ntlha bagolo ba Irana ba bua ba dumela go re makgamu a na le ditlamorago."" This translates to ""Reports, which were published on television, were the first major Iranian officials to speak believing that sanctions had an impact."" 

Therefore, ""metswedi e megolo"" (major sources/officials) is the group identified as believing the sanctions affected Iran's economy.



"
Ke efe ya dilo tse di latelang e e sa akarediweng mo thulaganyong ya go bouta ya Fora?,"The correct answer is **D: Diboutu tse di balwang ke baemedi ba ba tlhophilweng** (Votes counted by appointed representatives).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bosigo ditlhopho di balwe ke baithaopi ka fa tlase ga taolo e gagametseng, e latela melawana e beilweng."" (Votes are counted by officials under strict control, following set rules).  It doesn't mention *appointed representatives* counting votes.  It states *officials* do.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Mabokoso a go tlhopha a a bonalang sentle** (Transparent ballot boxes) – The passage mentions the use of transparent ballot boxes starting in 1988.
*   **B: Baemedi ba ba rometsweng ke batlhophiwa** (Representatives sent by voters) -  The passage states that voters who were rebought in the electoral system could send a representative to see how things were going.
*   **C: Go saena lenaane la batlhophi** (Signing the voter list) – The passage describes voters dipping their ballots and signing a list.



Therefore, option D is the only element *not* directly mentioned as part of the French voting process in the provided text."
Batlhophi ba supa kae motho yo ba mo tlhophileng?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo lenaaneng la batlhophi (In the list of voters)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""motlhopi o digela tlhopho ya gagwe mo lebokosong, a bo a saena mo batlhophi ba kwadilweng gone."" This translates to ""the voter inserts their ballot into the box, and then signs in the list of voters."" This clearly indicates that voters sign their names on a list of voters to confirm their participation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mo pampiring e e gatisitsweng pele (On a pre-printed form):** The passage mentions a ballot paper (""pampitshana"") but doesn't say voters sign on it.
*   **C: Mo enfelopong (On the envelope):** The passage does not mention an envelope being used for voting.
*   **D: Mo motšhining o o mo teng ga boalo (On a machine that is there):** The passage doesn't mention any machines involved in the voting process.



"
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Allen a simolole go batla Musashi ka dingwaga di le robedi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kgatlhego ya gagwe mo ntweng** (His interest in war).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...o simolotse letsholo la gagwe la go batla Musashi go tswa mo **kgatlhegong ya gagwe ya kgale ya ntwa**."" (He started his search for Musashi from his **long-standing interest in war**.)

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are *results* of his interest, not the initial *cause* for his decades-long search.

*   **A:** ""Bontsi jwa madi a gagwe"" (His wealth) - He *used* his wealth to fund the search, but it wasn't the reason he *started* it.
*   **B:** ""O tlile go dira ditlhotlhomiso tsa ka fa tlase ga metsi"" (He did underwater explorations) - This is what he *did* during the search, not why he began it.
*   **C:** ""Madi a a neng a a beetse mo go batlisiseng dilo mo lewatleng"" (The money he invested in searching the sea) - Again, this is about the funding, not the motivation.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, Allen o ne a dirisa madi a mantsi a gagwe mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go batla Musashi go tswa mo kgatlhegong ya gagwe ya kgale ya ntwa.**

The passage states: ""Allen go bolelwa ha beeleditse bontsi jwa madi a gagwe mo ditlhotlhomisong tsa ka fa tlase ga metsi e bile o simolotse letsholo la gagwe la go batla Musashi go tswa mo kgatlhegong ya gagwe ya kgale ya ntwa."" This directly states he spent a lot of his money on searching for the Musashi due to his long-standing interest in naval warfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dipatlisiso tsa lewatle** - While he did marine research, the passage specifies the *reason* for the research was the Musashi.
*   **C: Go aga ROV** - The ROV was *used* in the search, but the money wasn't spent *on building* it specifically (it's implied it was used for the overall search).
*   **D: Go ithuta ka go dira dimmapa tsa boalo jwa lewatle** - Mapping the seafloor was a *part* of the search, not the primary expenditure.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke sefe sa dilo tse di latelang se se ka tswang se ile sa dira gore go nne le maemo a a kotsi mo setlhareng le mo tikologong ya sone?","The correct answer is **A: Leokwane la yuraniamo.**

Here's why:

The passage states that officials *suspect* the tanks containing enriched uranium may have been breached and are leaking. This is the root cause of the potential danger, as indicated by the detected cesium and iodine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Marang a ditshitswana tsa Cesium:** Cesium is a *result* of the problem, not the cause.  It's a sign of leakage, but not what caused it.
* **C: Mosi o mosweu:**  The white smoke is a *symptom* of the problem, but doesn't explain *why* it's happening.
* **D: Yodine:**  Like cesium, iodine is a detected substance indicating a problem, but not the source of it.



"
Ke efe ya ditshitshinyo tse di latelang e e seng nngwe ya ditshitshinyo tsa pabalesego tse di neng tsa akantshiwa baagi ba selegae morago ga tiragalo e e diragetseng kwa setheong?,"The correct answer is **C: Tila go hema mosi o mosweu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that authorities advised people to *stay indoors* (B) and *not to drink well water* (D) due to the radiation leak. It also mentions closing windows (effectively advising against using fans – A). However, the passage *doesn't* advise against breathing the white smoke. In fact, the smoke itself is a visible sign of the issue and prompting the safety measures.  Therefore, breathing the white smoke is *not* a recommended safe practice.
"
"Go ya ka Dr. Moll, ke eng se se tshosang thata ka XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Palo e e kwa godimo ya dintsho tse o di bakang.**

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Dr. Moll as saying the new strain is “o tshosa tota ka ntha ya palo e e kwa godimo ya dintsho tse o di bakang” which translates to “very worrying because of the high number of deaths it causes.”

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mofuta ono o ne wa tsenwe ke mogare o, kwa bookelong.** - While the passage mentions potential spread from overseas, Dr. Moll doesn't state this is *what* is worrying about XDR-TB, but rather a potential source of the strain.
*   **B: Mofuta ono o na le go emelana le diritibatsi** - The passage doesn't explicitly state drug resistance as the primary concern.
*   **C: Palo ya batho ba motho yo o tshwaeditsweng a ka ba tshwaetsang** - While the passage mentions the transmissibility (10-15 people), this isn't the *most* worrying aspect according to Dr. Moll. The high death rate is.



"
Go tlhomamisitswe gore ke balwetse ba le kae ba ba tshwaeditsweng ke mofuta o moša wa mogare ba e neng e le badiri ba tsa kalafi?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo selekanyong sa ngwaga motho yo o nnang le mogare o, o kgona go tshwaetsa ba le 10 go ya ko go 15, ba ba amanang le ene thata. Mme fela, palo ya mogare wa XDR-TB mo setlhopeng sa batho botlhe ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa kgotlholo e tona, e lebega e santse e le ko tlase...""  It specifically says one person with the strain can infect **10 to 15** close contacts in a year.  The question asks about those who were healthcare workers, and the passage links the new strain to potential exposure from overseas *and* healthcare workers. Therefore, the maximum number mentioned (15) is the most relevant answer.



"
Tsamaiso ya NextGen e dirisa thekenoloji ya mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **A: Thekenoloji ya Sathalaete**.

The passage specifically states that NextGen uses ""setegeniki se se ikaegileng ka sathalaete"" (satellite-based technology) instead of the older, ground-based technology.  While the passage also mentions accuracy and reduced emissions, those are *results* of the technology, not the technology itself."
Baokamedi ba dipalangwa tsa difofane ba solegelwa molemo jang ke NextGen ka tlhamalalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Go supa kwa difofane di leng teng ka nepo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that NextGen uses satellite-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to *accurately* track aircraft location. This improved tracking is a direct benefit to air traffic controllers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go fofa sekgala se sennye** - While NextGen *allows* for planes to fly closer together, that's a result of the improved tracking, not the primary benefit to controllers.
*   **C: Go fokotsa mosi o o kgotlelang** - This is a benefit of NextGen overall, but not directly how it helps controllers.
*   **D: Di somarele dimilione tsa dilithara tsa leokwane** - Again, a result of NextGen, but not the direct benefit to controllers.

"Go ya ka serapa, bakwadi ba hisitori ga ba a ka ba tshwaya phoso FBI ka go bo e ne e tlhomile mogopolo mo go eng?","The correct answer is **A: Go oketsa selekanyo sa katlego ya bone**.

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI implemented a program ""with the aim of increasing the organization's success rate."" The question asks what historians criticized the FBI for prioritizing.  The passage directly links the program to improving the FBI's success rate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go abela bokebekwa jo bo ka rarabololwang motlhofo madi** - The passage doesn't mention anything about allocating resources to solvable crimes specifically.
* **C: Go tlhoma mogopolo thata mo dikgannyeng tsa ditshwantsho tsa thobalano** - The passage mentions the FBI sending agents to *look* at child pornography images, not focusing intensely on the images themselves as a central goal.
* **D: Dikgetsi tsa koloi tse di utswitsweng** - While car thefts are mentioned as an example of difficult-to-solve crimes, the FBI's aim wasn't just about those crimes, but all difficult cases to boost overall success rates.



"
Letsholo la go thibela boitsholo jo bo maswe le pateletsa FBI go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go aba ditsompelo tse di oketsegileng go tlhokomela dikgetsi tsa dikoloi tse di utswitsweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states the early FBI rules focused on *ditsompelo mo dikgetsing tse di se ng motlhofo go rarabololwa, bogolo jang dikgetsi tsa bogodu ja dikoloi* (clues in difficult-to-solve cases, especially car thefts).  The intention was to increase the organization’s success rate.  This directly relates to assigning more resources (ditsompelo tse di oketsegileng) to investigate stolen vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go oketsa kelo ya katlego ya setheo** - While *a consequence* of the rule change, it wasn't the *action* the rule change forced the FBI to do.
*   **C: Tlhoma mogopolo mo bokebekweng jo bo tshwanetseng go rarabololwa motlhofo** - The passage doesn't mention brainstorming or thought generation.
*   **D: Baemedi ba ba ineetseng mo dikgannyeng tsa ditshwantsho tsa thobalano** - The detail about sending ten agents to review adult film imagery is a separate, later development (from the 2005 funding program) and doesn't relate to the initial rule change.



"
Go ne ga direga eng ka koloi ya setimamolelo e e neng ya tsibogela go thulana ga JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: E ne ya pitikologa**.

The text states: ""...fa koloi ya setimamolelo ya maemelo-difofane e ne ya **pitikologa** e le mo letsholong la go thusa mo tiragalong e.""  This translates to ""...as the airport fire truck was **circulating** at the ready to assist with the incident.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E ne ya wa** (It crashed) - The text doesn't mention a crash.
* **C: E ne ya thunya** (It burned) -  The text doesn't mention fire *on* the truck, just that it was ready to help *with* a fire.
* **D: E ne ya felelwa ke lookwane** (It ran out of fuel) - The text doesn't mention fuel issues.



"
"Morago ga go Phatlakanathubega ga JAS 39C Gripen, boemafofane bo ne jwa tswalwa go dira eng?","The correct answer is **A: Difofane tsa kgwebo** (Commercial aircraft).

The passage states: ""...mme se sa baka go re boemelo-difofane bo tswalelwe difofane tsa kgwebo."" which translates to ""...and this caused the airfield to be cleared for commercial aircraft.""
"
Brzezinski o ne a kaela mang ka nako ya Phetogo ya Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states Brzezinski *assisted Carter* with the Iranian revolution (""...tsogolego puso ya Iran e e bakileng go re Iran e tsene mo seemong se sa iketlang sa go thupiwa ga batho ka 1979..."").  He was Carter's National Security Advisor.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Kissinger:** Brzezinski *replaced* Kissinger as NSA, he didn't advise him during the Iranian revolution.
*   **Kennedy & Johnson:** Brzezinski worked with them much earlier in his career, not during the Iranian revolution.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a nna Mogakolodi wa Tshireletsego ya Bosetšhaba go fitlha ka 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states that Brzezinski *replaced* Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor in 1977. Therefore, Kissinger held the position *until* 1977."
Ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a sa bontsheng sentle gore Bobek o ne a dira tiro ya gagwe le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **D: O ne a tshameka mo metshamekong e mentsi go gaisa motshameki ope fela.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Bobek played in *468* matches. While he scored a lot, the passage doesn’t state he played in *more* matches than any other player, only that he scored more goals. The other options directly relate to his success *with* Partizan:

    *   **A:** Directly mentions his goal total *while playing for the team*.
    *   **B:** Highlights his record-breaking goal-scoring *for the team*.
    *   **C:** Mentions being honored *by the team*.

Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't directly demonstrate his contribution to Partizan Belgrade."
Ke mafoko afe a a boammaaruri ka ditso tsa ga Bobek le Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a simolola go tshamekela Partizan ka 1945**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""O ne a ikgolaganya le bone ka 1945 a bo a nna go fitlha ka 1958."" This directly translates to ""He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O ne a tshamekela Zagreb pele ga Partizan Belgrade:** The text says he's *from* Zagreb, not that he *played for* Zagreb before Partizan.
* **C: O ne a tshamekela Partizan go fitlha ka 1995:** He played until 1958, not 1995.  1995 is the year he was *honored* by Partizan.
* **D: O ne a tuma fa a sena go tlhophiwa jaaka motshameki yo o gaisang wa Partizan:** The text says he *was honored* as the greatest player, it doesn't say he *became famous* after the honor. He was already famous for his playing career.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke nonofo efe e e farologanyang Hesperonychus le Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: E na le lenala le legolo la bobedi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Lenala la yone la bobedi le ne le le letona, ka jalo la isa magoletsa leina la Hesperonycus, le ra ya """"lenala la letlhakore la bophirima tsatsi.""""""  This means its second claw was particularly large, and this feature is what distinguishes it and inspired its name.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E na le maoto a mabedi** - The passage states it walked on two legs *like* Velociraptor, meaning it's a similarity, not a difference.
*   **C: E diphuka tse dintsi** -  The passage mentions it ate other birds, but this doesn't differentiate it from Velociraptor.
*   **D: E ne e le madi a a molelo** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"""Bokao jwa leina la """"Hesperonychus"""" bo tswa mo selong sefe sa mofuta ono?""","The correct answer is **A: Dikgofa (Claws)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lenala la yone la bobedi le ne le le letona, ka jalo la isa magoletsa leina la Hesperonycus, le ra ya """"lenala la letlhakore la bophirima tsatsi."""" "" This directly translates to ""Its second claw was curved, therefore giving it the name Hesperonycus, which means """"claw of the western side."""" 

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonychus"" originates from its claws.



"
Ke mafoko afe a a boammaaruri mo go a a latelang malebana le go thuntshiwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Go thuntshiwa go diragetse kwa Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...ba ne ba tla kwa Buffalo go keteka le ditsala le masika."" and ""...mongwe wa batho ba le 4 ba ba bolailweng fa go thuntshiwa, mme le gale, mosadi wa gagwe ene ga a gobala."" This clearly indicates the shooting happened in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Monna le mosadi ba ne ba tswa kwa Texas** - The text states they *were from* Texas, but it's not about the shooting location.
*   **B: Go ne go le batswasetlhabelo ba le batlhano** - The text says 4 people were killed, not 5 victims.
*   **C: Banyalani bano ba ne ba nyalana ngwaga pele ga foo kwa Buffalo** - The text states they got married in Texas the *previous year* and came to Buffalo to celebrate.



"
Ke polelo efe e e boammaaruri malebana le tiragalo e go thuntshitsweng mo go yone?,"The correct answer is **A: Go ne ga diragala kwa moletlong wa segopotso kwa Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...ba ne ba tla kwa Buffalo go keteka le ditsala le masika."" and ""...mongwe wa batho ba le 4 ba ba bolailweng fa go thuntshiwa..."" This clearly indicates the shooting happened in Buffalo during a gathering.
* The gathering was a celebration related to their recent marriage (a ""moletlo"" or celebration)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text doesn't mention the gathering being a ""formal"" (semolao) memorial.
* **C:** The text says they *travelled to* Buffalo from Texas, the incident didn't happen in Texas.
* **D:** The incident didn't occur at the wedding itself, but during a celebration *after* the wedding in Buffalo.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, badiredibagolo ba ne ba tshwenyegile ka eng fa ba utlwa ka Luno?","The correct answer is **B: Makhubu le diphefo tse di maatla**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""makhubu tse mashetla le makhubu tsa e kgoromeletsa mo maboteng a a diretsweng go sireletsa letshitshi kgatlhanong le makhubu a mashetla."" This directly indicates that strong waves and winds were a concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlhaela ga menontsha** - The text doesn't mention anything about the departure of pilots.
*   **C: Go dutla ga lookwane** - While the text mentions the size of the *lookwane* (ship), it doesn't state that its size was a concern.
*   **D: Ditlhabi tse di ka nnang teng go babereki mmogo** - The text mentions 12 passengers and only one fatality, but doesn’t state that the captain was worried about the passengers themselves.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mafoko afe a a latelang a a malebana le go tlhatlhamololwa ga Luno a a seng boammaaruri?","The correct answer is **B: Sekepe se ne se na le dimetara di le 100 tsa lookwane fa se ne se senyega**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Luno e ne rwele leokwane la dikubi metara tse 120 go ya kwa go di le 160 fa e senyega"". This means Luno, *not* the ship, was between 120 and 160 meters long when it sank. The passage then says ""Sekepe se sa selekanyo sa di methara tse 100 se ne se le mo tseleng..."" This tells us the ship was 100 meters long.

Therefore, option B incorrectly attributes the length of Luno to the ship at the time of sinking.

Let's look at why the other options are correct as stated in the passage:

*   **A: Go senyega go ne ga diragala pele ga go tsewa dithoto** - The text implies the sinking occurred before anyone noticed/could respond, which aligns with ""go tsewa dithoto.""
*   **C: Babereki mmogo ba le lesome le bobedi, mme go nnile le kgobalo fela ya go robega nko.** - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **D: Sekepe se ne sa kgoromelediwa mo seretseng** - The passage states ""diphefho tse mashetla le makhubu tsa e kgoromeletsa mo maboteng a a diretsweng go sireletsa letshitshi kgatlhanong le makhubu a mashetla,"" meaning the ship *was* reinforced.



"
Algeria e ne ya nna naga e e ikemetseng ka ngwaga ofe?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo dingwageng tsa bo 1960.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Vautier *returned* to Algeria in the 1960s to teach filmmaking. This implies Algeria was already independent or in the process of becoming independent during that time, as returning to a colonized country wouldn't be for the purpose of teaching its filmmaking. Algeria gained independence in 1962.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dingwaga tsa bo 1940:** Vautier started working with the French Resistance in WWII (during the 1940s) but that doesn’t relate to Algeria's independence.
*   **B: Dingwaga tsa bo1950:** While the Algerian War of Independence was happening in the 1950s, Algeria wasn't yet independent.
*   **D: Dingwaga tsa bo1970:** Vautier's hunger strike was in 1973, after Algeria was already independent.



"
Ke kae koo go neng go se na dithelebišene gone mo phitlhong?,"The correct answer is **D: Kwa St. Peter's Square**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the crowds were so large in St. Peter's Square that *not everyone could get in*.  That implies a lack of space, and the televisions were set up *around* the square to allow people to watch *because* they couldn't be *in* the square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mo mafelong a a farologaneng mo Roma:** The passage says televisions were *placed* in various locations in Rome, suggesting they *were* available there.
*   **B: Mo ditoropong tse di farologaneng tsa Italy:** The passage mentions other locations in Italy had similar setups, meaning televisions were present.
*   **C: Kwa mafelong mangwe kwa Poland:** Poland had viewing events *with* televisions, not a lack of them.



"
Tirelo ya phitlho e ne e tshwaretswe kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwa St. Peter’s Square**.

The text states that the crowds were so large it was impossible for everyone to get into the *phitlho kwa St. Peter's Square* (the service in St. Peter's Square). While the service was *broadcast* to other locations, the *location* of the service itself was St. Peter’s Square.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mo mafelong a a farologaneng kwa Roma:** While broadcasts were shown in various locations in Rome, this wasn't where the *phitlho* (service) was held.
*   **B: Ko Poland:** Poland was a location where the service was *watched* on television, not where it was held.
*   **D: Pele mo Roma, go be go latela toropo e nngwe ya Italy:** This isn't supported by the text. The focus is on Rome and then mentions Poland as another location for viewing.



"
"Morago ga go thunya, ke mang yo o neng a alafelwa dikgobalo tse di masisi?","The correct answer is **A: Batho ba le batlhano ba ba neng ba le teng**.

The text states: ""batho ba le batlhano ba ba neng ba le teng nako ya go thunya ba ne ba alafelwa letshogo.""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ope** - The text specifically says ""Go ne go sena ope mo ntlong eo"" (There was no one in the house).
* **C: Modiri wa setlamo sa gase** - The gas company worker arrived *after* the explosion.
* **D: Moagisani** - The informant called *before* the explosion but wasn't necessarily injured in it.



"
Ke mang yo o neng a bega ka go dutla ga gase?,"The correct answer is **A: Moagisane mo kagong.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...modiredi wa kgwebo ya gase o ne a goroga ko tiragalong morago ga go re **moagisane** a mo leletse mabapi le go dutla ga gase.""  This directly says the informant was the person who called about the gas leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Motho yo o nnang mo foleteng (Person living in the apartment):** The text doesn't mention anyone living in the apartment reporting the leak.
* **C: Modiredi wa setlamo sa gase (Gas station employee):** While a gas station employee was present after the incident, they were *called* about it, they didn't report it.
* **D: Mookamedi wa kago (Gatekeeper):**  The text doesn't mention a gatekeeper.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke batho ba le kae ba ba neng ba swa mo tlhaselong eo?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions four people who died:

*   **Nicholas Alden** (25 years old)
*   **Zachary Cuddeback** (21 years old)
*   **Edgar Veguilla** (shot in the arm and chest)
*   **Uka** (whose skull was split by a fifth man)

Therefore, the answer is 4."
Sebetsa sa ga mang se ne sa tlholwa ke go thuntsha ka nako nngwe fa go ne go tlhaselwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states: ""Tlhobolo ya ga Uka e ile sa tlholwa fa se santse se supile tlhogo ya monna wa botlhano."" This translates to ""Uka's skull was not fractured while still supporting the fifth man's head.""  This means Uka's skull was what was not broken during the attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cuddeback** - Cuddeback was the judge, not someone who suffered an injury.
*   **C: Schneider** - Schneider *had* extensive injuries and reconstruction, but his skull wasn't described as *not* fractured. The passage focuses on what wasn't broken about Uka.
*   **D: Alden** - Alden is only mentioned as being 25 years old, no injuries are associated with him.



"
Ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko o o neng wa tlosiwa mo thulaganyong ya Diolimpiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

The text states: ""…along with the sports of baseball and softball, which were dropped from the Olympic Games in 2005."" 

While squash and karate also tried to be included, they weren't *removed* previously. Rugby and golf are being *added* back in.
"
Ke mofuta ofe wa metshameko e e latelang o Komiti ya Boditšhabatšhaba ya Diolimpiki e neng ya tlhopha gore o akarediwe mo metshamekong eno?,"The correct answer is **C: Yunione ya Rugby**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rugby, segolo yunione ya rugby, le golf di ile tsa tlhophiwa go na le metshameko e mengwe e le metlhano go re e akanyediwe go tsaya karolo mo Diolimpiking.""  This directly says rugby (specifically union rugby) was selected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Roller** - The text says roller *tried* to be included, but doesn't say it was selected.
*   **B: Baseball** - The text mentions baseball was *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.
*   **D: Softball** - Similar to baseball, softball was *removed* from the Olympics in 2005."
Kwa tshimologong Arthur Guinness o ne a hira St James' Gate Brewery ka dingwaga tse kae?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The passage states Arthur Guinness signed a lease for the land for **9,000 years**. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - This refers to how long the company existed and grew, not the initial lease length.
*   **B: 10** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: 1759** - This is the year the lease was signed, not the duration of the lease.



"
Guinness e dira diranta di le dibilione di le kae ka ngwaga?,"The correct answer is **C: Di-euro di le lesome (US$14.7 billion)**.

The text states that Guinness makes ""more than ten billion euros (US$14.7 billion) per year."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dingwaga di le 9,000** - This refers to the length of the lease, not the revenue.
* **B: 250** - This refers to the number of years Guinness has been growing, not the revenue.
* **D: 10** - This is just part of the revenue figure (ten billion), not the full amount."
Go lemogilwe mogare wa H5N1 mo dinageng di le kae tsa European Union?,"The correct answer is **D: Di le robedi**.

Here's why:

The text states H5N1 has been confirmed in France, and then lists Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy as also being affected. That makes a total of seven countries.



"
Motho wa bofelo yo o neng a tshwaeditswe ke mogare wa H5N1 o ne a bonwa kae?,"The correct answer is **A: Fora**.

The text states: ""Mofuta wa mohikela wa dinonyane o o kgonang go balaya batho, H5N1, go tlhomamisitswe fa o fitlhetswe mo pidipiding ya naga e e suleng fa makadibeng a a gaufi le Lyon, kwa botlhaba jwa France."" This translates to: ""A strain of bird flu capable of killing humans, H5N1, has been confirmed after being detected in a farm in a rural area near Lyon, eastern France.""  Therefore, the most recent human case mentioned is in France.



"
Haiti e ne ya kopana leng la bofelo le bolwetse jono pele ga bo anama ka ntlha ya badisa ba kagiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Dingwaga tsa bo-1800.**

The text states: ""Pele ga kgorogo ya masole, Haiti e ne e ise e itemogele mathata a a malebana le bolwetse ga e sale ka dingwaga tsa bo-1800."" This directly answers the question of when Haiti last experienced this disease before the peacekeeping forces arrived.



"
Ke matlakala a a tswang kwa lefelong lefe a a neng a baka go anama ga bolwetse jono?,"The correct answer is **B: Kampa ya Lekgotla la Dichaba tse di Kopaneng**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the source of the bacteria was linked to unsanitary conditions at the UN camp (""leswe le le tswang mo kampeng ya Lekgotla la Dichaba tse di Kopaneng le ne le sa tlosiwa leswe sentle""). This contamination then entered the Artibonite River. While the Artibonite River *spread* the disease (A), it wasn't the *source* of it. Options C and D are irrelevant to the origin of the outbreak.



"
Puso ya Ireland e ikaeletse go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tlhama molao ka bonako jo bo kgonegang mabapi le batho ba ba dirang tlolomolao ya diritibatsi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Puso ya ma-Irish e gatelela go potlaka ga melao ya palamente go baakanya seemo."" (The Irish government is pushing for parliament to amend the law to address the situation.)  It also says the amendment needs to be ""ka bonako jo bo kgonegang"" (with appropriate severity) concerning those involved in drug-related offenses. This directly supports the idea of amending the law to deal with those *committing* drug-related crimes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text doesn't mention amending laws about *how* drugs are allowed, only about the consequences for dealing with them.
* **C:**  The text indicates a *stricter* approach, not a more lenient one (""ka bonako jo bo kgonegang"").
* **D:**  Removing the illegality of drugs entirely isn't mentioned; the focus is on amending existing laws concerning illegal activity.



"
Ke eng se se neng se letleletswe semolao ka nakwana kwa Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Diokobatsi**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""melato e e amanang le diokobatsi"" (offences related to drugs) and that people convicted of these offences had their sentences commuted when the new law came into effect. This indicates the law deals with drug-related crimes and their sentencing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go thuba (Theft):** The text doesn't mention theft.
*   **B: Bokebekwa (Respect/Dignity):** While the text mentions ""tshiamiso ya bokebekwa"" (restoration of dignity), it's discussing the *result* of the law change regarding drug offenses, not the offense itself.
*   **C: Go Tlhaselwa (Assault):** The text does not mention assault.



"
Motho yo go belaelwang gore o dirile molato o batlisisiwa ka eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go Tsena a se na tetla** (Trespassing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dipatlisiso mo rre wa mmelaelwa go wa go dira molato go **tsena mo lefelong la mong a sena tetla**..."" which directly translates to ""...investigation into the father of the accused for the crime of **entering someone's property without permission**..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mathata a mmele (Physical problems)** - The passage doesn't mention any physical issues.
* **C: Go senya dilo (Vandalism)** -  While the evidence was altered, the *crime* being investigated is not vandalism.
* **D: E seng wa go senyaka (Not a criminal)** - The father is *accused* of a crime, so this isn't the focus of the investigation.



"
"Fa motho yo o belaelwang a ne a fetola letshwao, o ne a se ka a dira eng?","The correct answer is **A: Fetola nngwe ya ditlhaka tsa yone** (Change one of its letters).

Here's why:

The text states the suspect altered the symbol by changing the letter ""O"" to a small ""e"". This directly means they changed one of the letters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E kgabise ka tshupo ya kagiso** (Decorate it with a peace symbol) - While a peace symbol *was* added, the core change was altering a letter.
* **C: Go e senya mo mmeleng** (To destroy it on the body) - The text doesn’t say the symbol was destroyed.
* **D: Dirisa thapoline e ntsho go e fetola.** (Use black tape to change it) -  Black tape was *used to make the change*, but the change itself was altering the letter.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, morutabana wa Seesemane e bong Karno o ne a sa latofadiwe ka eng mo go tse di latelang?","The correct answer is **C: Go gatisa dipapatso tse di sa letlelelwang.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ba thuto ya sesha ba mo latofaditse ka go gatisa dipapatso mo dibeseng mme a sena teseletso..."" This directly translates to ""The new education officials criticized him for publishing advertisements in books without permission.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions allegations of using whips, it states he wasn't convicted. This isn't something he was *disliked* for, but rather *accused* of.
*   **B:** Being like a friend to students isn't a negative thing, and the passage doesn't present it as criticism.
*   **D:** Using slang in the classroom is mentioned, but it's presented as a characteristic, not a reason for disapproval.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o neng a sa tsewa e le motshwarwa ke Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Bajanala**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lepodise la pele la Philippines le tshwere **bajanala ba Hong Kong** go nna batshwarakananyo..."" (The Philippine police held **Hong Kong tourists** hostage...).  Rolando Mendoza took the *bajanala* (tourists) hostage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lepodisi (Police):** Mendoza held *them* at bay, he didn't hold *them* hostage.
*   **C: Bana (Children):** While children were *among* the hostages, they weren't the primary group he targeted as the text focuses on the ""bajanala"" initially.
*   **D: Batsaya dinepe (Photojournalists):** They are mentioned later in the text, but weren't the initial hostages.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke batshwarwa bafe ba go neng go sa tlhomamisiwa gore ba tla gololwa pele ga nako?","The correct answer is **D: Bana**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Batshwarwakananyo ba le barataro, go akaretsa **bana** le bagolo, ba ne ba gololwa go sa le gale...""  This directly identifies children as being among those released early.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bajanala:** While the hostages *were* from Hong Kong, the question asks who was released early, not their origin.
*   **B: Bagolo:** The text states both children *and* adults were released, making this too broad.
*   **C: Batsaya dinepe:** The text refers to the kidnapper (Mendoza) and mentions a ""tsayadinepe"" (kidnapper) later in the text, but it doesn't state they were released early."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo o kokoanyang mesaeno ya go tshegetsa go letlelelwa ga manyalo a batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang kwa Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Badiraditshupetso**.

The passage states: ""Badiraditshupetso ba solofela go amogela kopo ya mesaeno e le sedikadike tse 1, 2 go e isa kwa Lekgotla kgolo la sechaba ka Ngwanatsele."" This directly indicates that the *Badiraditshupetso* (advocates) are the ones collecting the petition to support the legalization of same-sex marriage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as currently holding a draft law, but not as collecting the petition.
*   **C: Kereke ya Roman Catholic:** The passage states the church *opposes* same-sex marriage.
*   **D: Kopo ya ga Marta:** Marta is not mentioned in the passage."
Batlhabanelatumelo ba tla naya mang kopo ya bone?,"The correct answer is **C: Palamente ya Brazil**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the petitioners (badiraditshupetso) will present their petition ""to the National Congress (Lekgotla kgolo la sechaba) in November."" This means they are submitting their request to the Brazilian Parliament.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kereke ya Roman Catholic:** The passage mentions the Catholic Church's opposition to same-sex marriage, but the petition isn't *to* the church.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He currently holds the petition, but he is not the final recipient.
*   **D: Ratoropo wa São Paulo:** The first draft of the bill was written by the mayor of São Paulo, but the petition is not being sent to them.



"
"Go ya ka pego ya ga Armand Versace, go ne ga direga eng pele ga boidiidi bo simolola go tsibogela maemo a bosa?","The correct answer is **C: Phefo di tsamaya mo go 70km/oura.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metsotso ele thano mo tshopegetsong diphefo di a simolola, motsotso o latelang, phefo di tsamaya mo go 70km/oura…"" This directly describes what happened *before* the rain (boidiidi) started to worsen (""go tsibogela maemo a bosa"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E bo e simolola go na ka sehako.** - This describes *how* the rain started, not what happened *before* it.
*   **B: Metsotso e le metlhano mo tshopegetsong** - This is part of the sequence, but the 70km/hour winds are the event immediately preceding the worsening weather.
*   **D: O ne a latlhegelwa ke kgaitsadie** - This is about Armand's personal experience *during* the storm, not a preceding event.



"
"Go ya ka Versace, diphefo tse di maatla di ne tsa simolola leng?","The correct answer is **A: Metsotso e sekae morago ga gore pontsho e simolole.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Metsotso ele thano mo tshopegetsong diphefo di a simolola, motsotso o latelang, phefo di tsamaya mo go 70km/oura…""  This directly translates to ""Five minutes after the rainbow, the winds began, the next minute, the winds were traveling at 70km/hour…"" 

Therefore, the strong winds began a few minutes *after* the rainbow appeared.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Morago ga pula:** The text says the rain *started* after the winds.
*   **C: Fa a sena go latlhegelwa ke kgaitsadie:** Being startled by the lightning doesn't relate to when the winds started.
*   **D: E bo e simolola go na ka sehako:** This refers to the rain starting suddenly, not the winds.



"
"Pele ga Fred, go ne go na le ditsuatsue di le kae tse dikgolo tse di neng di begilwe kwa botlhaba jwa 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Tse tharo**.

The text states: ""ebile ele setshuatshue sa boraro se bonetse go pota mola wa 35°W ka fa botlhabatsatsi."" This directly translates to ""and it was the third storm to be spotted around the 35°W line recently."" Therefore, there were two other major storms before Fred in that region.
"
"Fa Fred a ne a le gaufi le ditlhaketlhake tsa Cape Verde, o ne a ya ntlheng efe?","The correct answer is **D: Bokone-bophirima**.

The passage states: ""Fred mo nakong ya gompieno o na le diphefo tsa selekanyo sa lebelo la dimaele di le 105 ka oura (165km/h) mme o tsamaela ma ntlheng a **bokone-bophirima**."" (Fred currently has winds of 105 knots (165km/h) and is moving in a **northwest** direction.)

Therefore, Fred was traveling northwest.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e nang le lobelo lo lo kwa godimo go feta tse di tlileng pele ga yone?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Mabelo a 802.11n a feta a tsa pele go menagane, ka kekelo ya 600Mbit/s.""  This means 802.11n has a higher speed than its predecessors.
"
Ke eng se se tlhokegang gore 802.11n e dirisanye le 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Dual radios.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that 802.11n's backwards compatibility with older standards like 802.11b is *enabled* by the use of **dual radios**.  This allows it to operate on both 2.4GHz (for compatibility with b/g) and 5GHz (for its higher speeds) simultaneously.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lobelo la 2.4Ghz le la 5.0Ghz.** - While 802.11n *uses* these frequencies, it doesn't *require* them for compatibility with 802.11b. 802.11b operates solely on 2.4Ghz.
*   **B: Bokgoni jwa 802.11b jwa go dira ka 5.0Ghz.** - 802.11b does *not* operate on the 5GHz band.
*   **C: Kekelo ya 600Mbit/s.** - This is the *speed* of 802.11n, not what allows it to work with 802.11b.



"
Mofenyi wa metale wa gouta wa Diolimpiki o ne a tshwanetse go thuma mo metshamekong e le kae kwa Metshamekong ya Mafatshe a Selekane?,"The correct answer is **B: A mararo.**

The passage states the swimmer was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle *and* in three medley events.  That's a total of three events."
Ke ka ntlha yang fa mmampodi wa metale wa gouta wa Diolimpiki a ne a sa tseye melemo ya ditlhabi tsa gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntse a sa kgone go tsaya diokobatsi tse a di tlhokang gore a okobatse matlhaba,ka di sa letlelelwa mo metshamekong.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ka ntlha ya go ngongorega ga gagwe, itekanelo ya gagwe e ne ya belaelwa. Ntse a sa kgone go tsaya diokobatsi tse a di tlhokang go re a okobatse matlhaba, ka di sa letlelelwa mo metshamekong.""  This directly explains why he couldn't benefit from his talent – he needed medication for his condition, but it wasn't allowed at the games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O ne a sa utlwe botlhoko bope** - The passage doesn't mention anything about him not feeling pain.
* **B: Ntse a sa kgone go tsaya diokobatsi tse a di tlhokang.** - This is true, but it doesn't explain *why* he couldn't take them. Option C gives the complete reason.
* **D: Ga go a letlelelwa kwa Metshamekong ya Mafatshe a Selekane.** - While true that his medication wasn't allowed, this doesn't explain the direct reason he couldn’t benefit from his talent. It’s the *reason* it wasn’t allowed that matters.



"
"Go ya ka temana e, ke eng se se ka tswang se ile sa dira gore go nne le tlhakatlhakano malebang le tiragalo ya dithoromo tsa lefatshe?","The correct answer is **A: Go nna gone ga maru a ntshontsho.**

Here's why:

The text states, ""Maru a ntshontsho a a sa amaneng ka gope le tiragalo ya lekgwamolelo go ne ga begiwa fa a bonetse ka fa tlase ga thaba. Maru a tlisitse kgonagalo ya tsietsego ya go re a mme tota lekgwamolelo le diragetse."" This directly indicates that the observation of these unusual ""maru a ntshontsho"" (floating debris) led to confusion and the possibility of misinterpreting whether an eruption actually occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dipego tsa offisi ya tepoloapi ya Iceland.** While the Icelandic Meteorological Office *confirmed* there was no earthquake, they didn't *cause* the confusion. They clarified the situation.
* **C: Mmapa wa mafatshefatshe ka dithoromo tsa lefatshe.** The map simply presented information; it didn't create the confusion.
* **D: Tiro e e begilweng mo dikgaolong tse dingwe tsa Iceland.** The text doesn't mention any reports from other parts of Iceland contributing to the confusion, only the debris observations.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, go ne ga direga leng gore go nne le phetogo e kgolo?","The correct answer is **A: Ka Mopitlo a le 10.**

The text states: ""Thoromo ya lefatshe e e tseneletseng, e e neng ya fetola seemo kwa letlhakoreng la bokone-botlhaba jwa mosima o o kwa godimo ga lekgwamolelo e diragetse ka Mopitlo a le 10.""  This directly translates to ""The significant earthquake that changed the situation on the northeast side of the volcano occurred on April 10th.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mo diureng tse 48 tse di fetileng:** This refers to when the Icelandic Meteorological Office reported *no* earthquake activity, not when the major change happened.
* **C: Ka Mopitlo a le 10:** This is a duplicate of the correct answer.
* **D: Beke pele ga moo:** This refers to a claim made by the US, which was later contradicted. The text focuses on the actual event date.



"
"Ke mafoko afe a a latelang, a a malebana le sedirisiwa sa Chandrayaan-1, a a sa siamang?","The correct answer is **A: Sekepe se se neng sa e romela se ne se na le batho ba se neng se tsamaya le bone.**

Here's why:

The passage describes Chandrayaan-1 as an *unmanned* lunar probe. It didn't carry a crew. The other statements are all supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage states it carried important scientific instruments.
*   **C:** It successfully impacted near the south pole of the Moon.
*   **D:** It had the Indian flag painted on its sides.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information provided."
"Ke mafoko afe mo go a a latelang, a a tlhalosang sentle se se neng sa dirwa ke sedirisiwa sa go tlhatlhoba ngwedi?","The best answer is **C: E ne ya wela ka katlego gaufi le south pole ya ngwedi.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""mme ya wela ka katlego gaufi le south pole ya Ngwedi"" (and landed successfully near the south pole of the Moon). This directly describes what the spacecraft *did*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: E ne ya kotama gaufi le south pole ya ngwedi.** (It orbited near the south pole of the moon) - While it was traveling *towards* the south pole, the key achievement was the landing, not just orbiting.
* **B: Go kotama ga yone go ne ga atlega.** (Its orbiting was successful) - The passage focuses on the *landing*, not the orbiting.
* **D: E ne e rwele didirisiwa tse di  botlhokwa tsa maranyane.** (It carried important tools) -  This describes *what it had*, not *what it did*.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke kgato efe ya go sireletsa kgatlhanong le bolwetse e e tla dirisiwang la bofelo?","The correct answer is **D: Matsela a thibelang menang.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...go aba dikete tsa **matsela a thibelang menang** le dibolaya leroborobo la diji."" This directly indicates that distributing mosquito nets is a measure being taken to combat the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dibolaya leroborobo la diji.** - While mentioned, it's listed *along with* the mosquito nets, not as the final step.
*   **B: Batshwari ba dikolobe.** - This refers to controlling mosquito populations, but isn't a direct protective measure for people.
*   **C: Mekento ya bolwetse jwa go ruruga ga boboko.** - This refers to funding for research, not an immediate protective action.



"
Bolwetse jono bo tsena jang mo bathong?,"The correct answer is **A: Menang**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bolwetse bo tsamaisiwa ke dikolobe, bo bo bo tsena batho ka menang."" which translates to ""The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes, and it enters people through bites.""
"
Go palelwa ke go dirisa polelwana ya bobedi go ka felela ka eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go thibelwa ga manyalo a batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang**.

Here's why:

The passage states that rejecting the second seal (seele sa bobedi) ""could make same-sex marriage happen in the state."" This implies that *keeping* the second seal, or preventing its removal, would *prevent* same-sex marriage. Therefore, failing to use the second seal leads to the possibility of allowing same-sex marriage, while *using* it (or allowing it to be removed) leads to the prohibition of it.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tshekatsheko ya ka bonako ya HJR-3** - The passage discusses HJR-3 but doesn't say that failing to use the second seal results in a review of it.
*   **B: Tshwanelo ya mo isagweng ya go nyalana ga batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang** - This is the opposite of what the passage implies.
*   **C: Nakokopanong ya tokafatso ya melao** - The passage mentions the legislative session, but failing to use the second seal isn't about the session itself, but its outcome.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, polelwana ya bobedi e ne ya kganelwa ka fa molaong leng?","The correct answer is **A: Ka nako ya kopano ya molaotheo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go ganwa ga seele sa bobedi, se se neng se batla go simolodisa go kganela ka fa molaong go nyalana ga batho ba bong jo bo tshwanang, go ka dira go re manyalo a bong jo bo tshwanang a diragale mo isagong. Go latela tsamaiso, HJR-3 e tla sekasekwa gape go nna mo tirisong ka 2015 kana 2016 ke badira molao ba ba tla bong ba tlhophilwe.""

This means the second reading (seele sa bobedi) was rejected *during a constitutional session* (nako ya kopano ya molaotheo) which led to the potential for same-sex marriage to become legal. The dates mentioned (2011, 2015) refer to other events, not the rejection of the second reading itself.



"
"""Ke bomang ba ba neng ba filwe """"Dipampiri tsa Panama""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Setheo sa molao sa Mossack Fonseca.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dipampiri tsa Panama ke lereo le dirisiwang mo ditokomane di ka nna dimilione go tswa kwa setheong sa molao sa kwa Panama e leng Mossack Fonseca..."" This directly identifies Mossack Fonseca as the source of the Panama Papers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bobegadikgang.** - While the papers *revealed* information about individuals, they weren't *given* to whistleblowers.
*   **C: Deutsche bank.** - Deutsche Bank was *involved* as a bank that helped clients, but didn't originate the papers.
*   **D: Baeteledipele ba puso ya Iceland** - They were affected *by* the papers (resigned), but didn't receive them.



"
"Go ya ka serapa, ke mang yo bobegadikgang jwa Borithane bo neng jwa bolela gore o ne a laola bontsi jwa ditlamo tse di neng di dirisiwa go fitlha dikhumo?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche bank.**

The passage states: ""Lokwalodikgang lwa Borithane e leng The Guardian le bontsha gore Deutsche Bank e e laolwang ke nngwetharong ya dikhampani di le 1 200 tsa dikgapetla tse di diretsweng go dira seno."" This directly states that The Guardian reported Deutsche Bank controlled a large number of shell companies used for concealment.
"
"Ke dife tsa dikotsi tse di latelang tsa difofane, tse di neng tsa bolaya batho ba le bantsi?","The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ne sa phutlhama fa se ne se ya kwa Armenia, se tswa kwa Iran.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kgwedi e e fitileng, Iran e bone kotsi ya bone e masisi go di feta tsotlhe ya tsamo phefong fa sefofane se se neng seya Armenia se phutlhama, se bolaya batho bale kgolo le masome a marataro le boferabobedi.""  This translates to ""...last month, Iran experienced its deadliest crash when a plane heading to Armenia crashed, killing 130 and 16 others.""

This is explicitly stated as the most fatal incident mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go phatlakana ga helikopotara ya mapodisi** - This incident caused 3 deaths and injured 3, far fewer than the Armenia crash.
*   **C: Sefofane se ne sa phutlhama fa se ne se ya kwa Iran se tswa kwa Armenia.** - The passage says the plane was *going to* Armenia *from* Iran, not the other way around.
*   **D: Go relela ga sefofane kwa Mashhad.** - This incident killed 70 people, which is significant but less than the 146 killed in the Armenia crash.



"
Ke eng mo go tse di latelang se e seng lebaka la gore go nne le dikotsi tse dintsi tsa difofane kwa Iran?,"The correct answer is **A: Difofane tse di tsofetseng tsa sesole le tsa setšhaba** (Old military and civilian aircraft).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Iran has ""old, neglected aircraft used by the military and the general public."" This is directly linked to the high number of crashes.  The other options are related, but less *direct* causes:

* **B & C:** While international sanctions *contribute* to the problem by limiting the ability to purchase new planes, the *direct* cause of the crashes is the use of old planes. The sanctions explain *why* they have old planes, not *that* they have old planes.
* **D:**  ""Neglected aircraft"" is a symptom of the problem (likely due to lack of resources, potentially caused by sanctions), but the *fundamental* issue is the age of the fleet.



"
"Ke dintlha dife tse di latelang, tse di neng di seyo mo pegong ya dithutiso tsa kwa Iraq?","The correct answer is **A: Go tshwaiwa maitlamo a gompieno a Bookamedi.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Pego e e tshwaya phoso thata bontsi ja dikarolotsa maitlamo a gompieno a Bookamedi, a a itebagantseng le Iraq..."" (The statement strongly condemns the current positions of the Bookamedi factions involved in Iraq...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the statement mentions the *hope* of stopping conflicts, it doesn't claim certainty or that changes *will* stop them. It says there's no one who can currently guarantee that.
* **C:** The passage mentions ""megopolong ya bone,"" but focuses on starting new dialogues, not specifically protecting information as a past action.
* **D:** This is mentioned, but it's a separate component of the statement, not a central point being *contained within* the statement itself. The main point is the condemnation of the Bookamedi factions.



"
Setlhopha sa dithutiso sa kwa Iraq  se ne sa se ka sa Tlhomamisa eng mo go seno se se latelang mo pegong ya sone?,"The correct answer is **D: Go simololwe mothale o mongwe wa dipuisano pele ngwaga o, o wela.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo megopolong e 78 ya bone, wa ntlha ke go re go simololwe motlhale o mongwe wa dipuisanyo pele ngwaga o o wela..."" This directly answers the question of what the Iraqi education group committed to in their statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions protecting Iraq's information from aggressors, it doesn't state the group *committed to* this. It's a goal, not a commitment in this statement.
*   **B:** ""Phetogo ya bofefo"" (radical change) is something the statement *calls for* but isn't a commitment *by* the group.
*   **C:** The passage mentions a call for dialogue, but not a commitment *by the group* to open dialogue. It's a request directed at others.



"
"Go ya ka mapodisi, ke mang yo o neng a tsewa e le letsogo la moja la ga Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Picco**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mapodisi a ne a re Lo Picco o mo maemong a kwa godimo ka go re o nnile mothusi wa ga Provenzano kwa Palermo..."" This directly identifies Lo Picco as being considered a close associate/helper of Provenzano by the police.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Giovanni Falcone:** The text mentions Falcone as a victim of the mafia war, not an associate of Provenzano.
*   **C: Ansa:** Ansa is mentioned at the beginning of the passage but isn't described as being linked to Provenzano.
*   **D: Paolo Borsellino:** Like Falcone, Borsellino was a victim of the mafia and not connected to Provenzano in the way described.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo karolong eno, ke eng se se gapileng botshelo jwa Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Botshelo jwa gagwe bo ne jwa gapiwa ka nako ya ntwa e e neng e eteletswe pele ke Riina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ntwa e e neng ya gapa matshelo a batlhani ba mmafia e bong Giovanni Falcone le Paolo Borsellino ka ngwaga was 1992."" This directly links Falcone's death to the war led by Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O ne a thuntshiwa ke mapodisi** - The passage says *others* of high rank were investigated, not Falcone.
*   **C: Lo Picco o ne a  tla dira gore ntwa ya boetapele e ne e tla runya** - This refers to fears about a leadership war, not Falcone's fate.
*   **D: O ne a bolawa ke Paulo Borsellino yo e neng e le mongwe wa Batlhabani ba Mmafia.** - The passage states Borsellino *and* Falcone were victims of the war, not that one killed the other.



"
Ke efe mo go tse di latelang e e seng nngwe ya dilo tse Hitoshi Saito a di anaanelang?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmampodi wa Lefatshe makgetho a le mabedi**.

Here's why:

The passage states Saito was a **two-time Olympic gold medalist**, but it does *not* say he was a two-time World Champion. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

*   **B: Modulasetulo wa Komiti ya Lekgotla la Japane Yotlhe la Judo.** The text explicitly states he was the chairperson of this committee.
*   **C: Ke mofenyi wa gauta wa Diolimpiki gabedi** The text explicitly states he was a two-time Olympic gold medalist.
*   **D: Mankge wa Judo** The text starts by mentioning he was a judo player.



"
Iwasaki o ne a kgona jang go falola nyalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The passage states: ""a falola nyalo ko Nepal..."" which directly translates to ""he eloped in Nepal.""

Therefore, Iwasaki eloped in Nepal."
Ke mang yo o neng a tlhasela Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntša**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""O ne a utswelwa ke dilalome, **a tlhaselwa ke ntsa e e nang le molafu ko Tibet**, a falola nyalo ko Nepal a bo a tshwarwa ke ba sepodise ko India."" 

This directly translates to: ""He was chased by thieves, **attacked by a leopard in Tibet**, escaped marriage in Nepal and was arrested by police in India.""

Therefore, the leopard (ntša) is the one who attacked Iwasaki.



"
Alonso o ne a wetsa leng lebelo la gagwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa Schumacher a sena go wetsa lobelo lwa gagwe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fernando Alonso o ne a eteletse pele lebelo ka nako e telele, mme o ne a le wetsa ko maemelong, gongwe e le ka ntlha ya leotwana le le sa tsenngwang sentle la ko pele ka fa mojeng.""  This translates to ""Fernando Alonso led the race for a long time, but lost the lead in the final stages, possibly due to a loose front wheel.""

The timing of Alonso losing the lead is connected to the events happening *after* Schumacher had issues (""ditshenyego tsa sasepenshene go tswa mo dintweng tse dintsi mo kgaisanong"" - problems with suspension from many collisions in the race). Therefore, Alonso lost the lead after Schumacher experienced difficulties."
Ke eng se se neng sa dira gore Schumacher a fetse kgaisano ya gagwe pele ga nako?,"The correct answer is **D: Go senyega ga sasepenshene ya koloi** (Suspension damage).

The passage specifically states: ""Michael Schumacher o feditse kgaisano ya gagwe moragonyana fela ga Alonso, ka lebaka la ditshenyego tsa sasepenshene go tswa mo dintweng tse dintsi mo kgaisanong."" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, due to suspension damage from many incidents in the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ne a latlhegelwa ke taolo ya koloi ya gagwe** (He lost control of his car) - This happened to Fisichella, not Schumacher.
*   **B: Go thulana le Alonso** (Competing with Alonso) - While they were racing, this wasn't the *reason* Schumacher finished early.
*   **C: Tshenyo ya maotwana e e bakilweng ke Fisichella** (Damage to tires caused by Fisichella) - The passage doesn't link Fisichella to Schumacher's retirement. It mentions a possible tire issue for Alonso, but not Schumacher."
"Go ya ka serapa, ke tiro ya ga mang go baya batho ba ba tshwerweng kwa lefelong la batshwarwa?","The correct answer is **A: Lepodise le le tshwereng mmelaelwa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Molaodi o baya tlhwatlhwa ya madi a kgololo, fa kopo ya teng e atlegile, a bo a bega semmuso, ditatofatso tse di begilweng ke **lepodise le le tshwereng mmelaelwa**."" This directly translates to ""The officer posts bail, if the application is successful, and formally releases, the details filed by **the arresting officer**.""  Therefore, the arresting officer is responsible for placing people in holding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moatlhodi Glynn:**  Moatlhodi Glynn issued an order *regarding* releases, but didn't physically place people in holding.
*   **C: Lefelo la go Tsaya Dipeeletso:** (The place to take pleas) This is where legal processes happen, not where people are initially held.
*   **D: Motsamaisi wa Kgotlatshekelo:** (Prison Manager) They are mentioned in relation to notifications, but not the initial placement in holding.



"
"Go ya ka taelo ya kganelo ya nakwana ya go tsena mo ntlong e e umakilweng mo serapeng, batho ba ba tshwerweng ba tshwanetse go letlelelwa go nna le eng gore ba tshwarwe lobaka lo lo fetang diura di le 24?","The correct answer is **D: Tsheko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after being arrested, individuals must receive a ""tsheko"" (test/assessment) and if successful, it is formally recorded. This assessment determines if their test is valid, allowing them to be held longer than 24 hours.  The warrant issued by Judge Glynn *requires* this assessment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba golotswe (They were released)** - The passage describes releases happening *before* the warrant, and the warrant is about *preventing* extended detention without proper process.
* **B: Go kopana le lepodise le le tshwereng mmelaelwa (Meeting with the investigating officer)** - While meeting with the officer is part of the process, it's not the specific requirement for holding someone over 24 hours as outlined in the warrant.
* **C: Taelo ya kganelo ya nakwana e e ntshitsweng ke Moatlhodi Glynn (The warrant issued by Judge Glynn)** - The warrant itself isn’t what they *need to have*, it’s the *reason* for needing the assessment.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke lebaka lefe le le sa dirisiwang go tlhalosa go emisa tswelopele ya ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **B: Kganetsano le molaotheo** (Conflict with the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that international representatives *saw a discrepancy in the foundational law of Afghanistan, leading them to take the position that a certain aspect of sanctions was not necessary*. This indicates a conflict between the proposed sanctions and the Afghan constitution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tshireletsego e e nnang mo kotsing** (Protection in danger): The passage *mentions* protecting people, but doesn't present this as the *reason* the sanctions are being questioned.
*   **C: Ditshenyegelo tse di kwa godimo** (High costs): Cost isn't mentioned as a factor.
*   **D: Go potapota ga molaotheo** (Circumventing the constitution): The passage implies a direct conflict *with* the constitution, not an attempt to go around it.



"
"Goreng, mo bofelong, badipolomate ba sa tsaya gore go a tlhokega go tswela pele ka ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **C: Go ne go na le go potapota mo molaotheong** (There was ambiguity in the constitution).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baemedi ba mafatshe ba re ba bone tlhakatlhakano ya selekanyo se se kwa godingwana mo molao-motheong wa Afghanistan, mo go diriling go re ba tseye tshweetso ya go re tikilogo e nngwe ya ditlhopho ga e tlhokafale."" This directly translates to ""International representatives said they saw an ambiguity in the Afghan constitution, leading them to take the position that a certain legal basis for trials was not required.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ne go le kgatlhanong le molaotheo (It was against the constitution):** The passage doesn't state the trials *were* unconstitutional, only that there was ambiguity *within* the constitution.
*   **B: Tshireletsego e ne e le mo kotsing (Security was at risk):** While security is a concern in Afghanistan, the passage doesn't link it to the decision regarding the trials.
*   **D: Ditlhopho di ne di ja madi a le mantsi thata (The trials were too expensive):**  Cost isn't mentioned as a factor in the passage.



"
Ke mang a tlamelang FATA ka ditirelo tsa boatlhodi?,"The correct answer is **B: Baemedi ba sepolotiki**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Badiredi ba tsa Polotiki"" (Political Agents) were appointed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan to govern FATA and were responsible for providing governmental and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution. Therefore, they are the ones providing the services."
"Ke dife tsa dintlha tse di latelang ka “ Baemedi ba Sepolotiki” ba FATA, tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Ba obamela molaotheo wa Pakistane**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Political Agents"" operated *under* Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution, but it also highlights they had significant autonomy and could govern FATA ""as they pleased."" This implies they weren't fully accountable to the standard constitutional framework in the same way other regions were.  They were a special administrative system with a lot of discretion.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the passage and general understanding of the situation:

*   **A: Ba tlamela ditirelo tsa boatlhodi:** The passage mentions they were responsible for government and judicial services.
*   **B: Ba ne ba tlhophiwa ke moporesidente wa Pakistane:** While the passage doesn't explicitly state this, it's historically accurate that Political Agents were appointed by the central government (often through the President).
*   **D: Ba na le taolo ka botlalo mo dikgaolong tse dingwe:** The passage suggests this is true, stating they could govern as they wished.



"
Ke sekgele sefe seo Emma Stone a neng a se tlhophetswe?,"The correct answer is **C: Modiragatsi wa mosadi yo o gaisang botlhe**.

The text states: ""Gosling le Stone ba tlhophilwe go ya makgalokgannyeng a go phadisanyetsa sekgele sa Modiragatsi yo o Gaisang, wa monna, le wa mosadi, ka tatelano.""  This directly translates to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone being nominated for the awards for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively.
"
Ke sekgele sefe seo baesekopo e neng e sa tlhophelwa sone?,"The correct answer is **A: Setshwantsho se se di gaisang tsotlhe** (Best Picture).

The text states the movie received awards in *all* categories it was nominated for *except* Best Picture.  The other options (cinematography, sound, original song) *did* win awards.
"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa leng ya tswelela pele e dira morago ga thoromo ya lefatshe?,"The correct answer is **D: Lefelo la go fetlha motlakase mo Niigata**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata ""bereka sentle fela"" (operated normally). This means it was *not* affected or did *not* experience issues after the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Didiriswa tsotlhe tse di laolang maatla kwa bodirelong ba Hokuriku Shika:** The passage explicitly states these were *stopped* (""di ne tsa tswalwa"").
*   **B: Boemafofane mo Ishikawa:** The passage says these were *closed* (""bo tsweetswe"").
*   **C: Tirelo yotlhe ya diterena:** The passage states rail services were *disrupted* (""diterelo tsa diterena di kgoreletsegile"").

Therefore, the only option that did *not* experience a disruption was the Niigata power plant."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e senyegileng ka ntlha ya thoromo ya lefatshe?","The correct answer is **C: Ditsela tse dingwe**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ditsela dingwe di senyegile..."" (Some roads were damaged...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Magae a mangwe** - While the passage mentions homes were without water or electricity, it doesn't say they were *damaged*.
*   **B: Didiriswa tse pedi tse di laolang maatla kwa bodirelong jwa Shika** - The passage says these were *stopped* (tswalwa), not damaged.
*   **D: Boemafofane ba Noto** - The passage states these were *closed* (tsweetswe), not damaged.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dikgang tse di latelang, e e sa akarediwang mo tokomaneng?","The correct answer is **B: Se se bakileng ntwa ya 1967**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on the *outcome* of the 1967 war (territories being disputed), not the *cause* of the war.** It mentions what Palestine wants regarding territory *after* the war, and Israel's position on troop presence.
*   **A: Isagwe ya Jerusalema** is directly mentioned as a point of contention (""including the land of Jerusalem"").
*   **C: Go nna gone ga masole mo mokgatšheng** is discussed – Israel wants troops there for ten years, while the PA agrees to five.
*   **D: Kgotlhang ka melelwane** is alluded to, as the passage speaks about territorial disputes and border lines.

Therefore, the only option *not* found within the information provided in the passage is the cause of the 1967 war.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng nngwe ya ditopo tsa Palestina?","The correct answer is **D: Go nna gone ga masole ga dingwaga di le tlhano mo mokgatšheng wa Jordan.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Israel wants soldiers stationed there for ten years, but the PA only agreed to five. This is a point of *disagreement*, not a demand *by* Palestine. The other options (A, B, and C) are all things Palestine *is* seeking:

* **A: Melelwane e e theilweng mo maemong a pele ga ntwa** - The passage directly states Palestine wants borders based on the pre-1967 lines.
* **B: Go nna gone ga masole mo go tsweletseng, mokgatšheng wa Jordan** -  The passage mentions the Jordan Valley as a key area for potential military presence.
* **C: Dikarabo tebang le isagwe ya Jerusalema** - The passage states Jerusalem is a point of contention and sacred to both sides.



"
Ma o ithutetse molao mo lefatsheng lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika**.

Here's why:

The text states that Ma studied at a New York college and Harvard Law School, both located in the United States of America (Dinaga tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika).
"
"Go ya ka temana,bobueledi ba lefatshe lefe bo thusitse mo phenyong ya Ma ya ditlhopho?","The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ma ""o ne a nna le moagedi mo Amerika"" (was an immigrant in America) and that he studied at New York schools and Harvard Law.  This American education and experience clearly helped his career, especially considering his success in cross-border deals with mainland China.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hong Kong** - While he was born in Hong Kong, the passage doesn’t state it *helped* his success, just his origin.
*   **C: United Kingdom** - The passage doesn't mention the United Kingdom at all.
*   **D: China** - His success was *in relation to* mainland China, but his background and education were from America.



"
"Jaaka go kailwe mo temaneng, Carolyn Wilson o ne a direla mang pele a fuduga kwa toropong eo?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Carolyn Wilson wa OHA o utsule madi a bone a peeletso, a bo a sia a tswa ka toropo."" This directly translates to ""Carolyn Wilson of OHA cashed their appeal money and then left town.""  Therefore, she worked for OHA before leaving town.



"
"Ka go setse mabelo a le mane mo pakeng, ke mang yo o leng mo maemong a bone a Bommampodi ba Bakgweetsi?","The correct answer is **C: Stewart**.

Here's how we find it in the text:

The passage states: ""Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth, le Harvick ba digela maina a batho ba maemo a ntlha a a lesome a kgaisano ya bakgweetsi, go sentse go setse mabelo a le mane mo pakeng eno.""  This means Stewart is in the top ten and there are only four spots remaining, placing him in the 10th position (or 6th from the back of the top 10).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hamlin** is in 3rd place.
*   **B: Kahne** is in 5th place.
*   **D: Bowyer** is behind Hamlin, not in the top 10.



"
"Morago ga lobelo lo lo umakilweng mo temaneng, Kahne o na le dintlha di le kae mo Bommampoding ba Bakgweetsi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne le Truex ba mo maemong a botlhano le borataro ka go letelelana, ka dintlha di le 2,220 le 2,207.""  This directly tells us Kahne has 2,220 points.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke ga kae batho ba bona didumedi tse di welang mo lefatsheng, tseo morago go fitlhelwang di tswa kwa polaneteng ya Mars?","The correct answer is **B: Ga tlhano**.

The text states: ""Seno go dumelwa e le lekgetho la botlhano mo ditsong..."" which translates to ""It is believed to be the fifth discovery in the stones...""  This means five stones have been found that are believed to originate from Mars.
"
"Jaaka go umakilwe mo temaneng, ke eng sa boammaruri ka matlapa a go fitlhetsweng a tswa kwa polaneteng ya Mars?","The correct answer is **D: Di 34**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ke fela a ka nna masome a mararo le bone (34) a go tlhomamisitsweng a tlholegile ko lebopong la Mars."" This directly answers the question of how many Martian meteorites have been identified.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the text mentions a shower in February, it doesn't state *all* the meteorites were found then.
*   **B:** 24,000 refers to the total number of meteorites that fall to Earth, not specifically from Mars.
*   **C:** The text states the price is *up to* $22,500 per ounce, and compares it to gold. It doesn’t say the value *exceeds* gold by $11,000.



"
Schumacher o rotse tiro neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Morago ga tshagakanyo ya Felipe Massa** (After Felipe Massa's accident).

Here's why:

The text states Schumacher *stood ready to step in for Felipe Massa* after Massa was injured in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. This implies he returned to racing *because of* Massa's accident. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Morago ga phenyo ya gagwe ya bosupa ya bommampodi** (After his successful Formula 1 career) - The text says he retired *after* a successful career, but his return wasn't directly because of that retirement.
*   **C: Morago ga go tsena mo legatong la ga Felipe Massa** (After entering Felipe Massa's place) - He was *ready* to enter Massa's place, but the accident prompted the return.
*   **D: Mo bokhutlong ba paka ya 2009** (At the end of the 2009 season) - While he raced until the end of 2009, this doesn't explain *why* he returned.



"
Massa o gobetse neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka nako ya Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Massa o gobetse tlhogo morago ga go nna le kotsi ko dikgaisanong tsa Hungarian Grand Prix ka ngwaga wa 2009."" This directly translates to ""Massa was hit after an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.""  Grand Prix is a type of race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Morago ga go fenya bommampodi ba Formula 1** - While Schumacher retired *after* winning championships, Massa's injury wasn't directly related to that.
* **C: Pele ga fa Schumacher a rola tiro** - Massa was injured *after* Schumacher's retirement.
* **D: Pele ga paka ya 2009** - The text specifies the injury happened *during* the 2009 Grand Prix, not before the season started.



"
"Go ya ka temana, thulaganyo e tla ama jang AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Palo ya badirisi ba AOL e tla gaisiwa ke ya badirisi ba Yahoo le Microsoft** (The number of AOL users will be overtaken by Yahoo and Microsoft users).

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined number of Yahoo! and Microsoft users *outnumbers* AOL's. The phrasing ""kgololosego eno e ka nna ya fela"" (this dominance could end) directly implies AOL will no longer be the leading player, meaning their user base will be surpassed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Palo ya badirisi ba AOL e ka nna ya oketsega** (The number of AOL users might increase) - The text suggests the opposite; AOL's dominance is threatened.
*   **B: AOL e tla nna setheo se le sosi se se tlhabolotsweng mo mmarakeng wa IM** (AOL will become a significant force in the IM market) - This is not supported by the passage, which focuses on a potential *loss* of dominance.
*   **D: AOL ga e sa tlhole e tla dirisiwa kwa Dinageng tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika** (AOL will no longer be used in the United States) - The passage doesn't suggest AOL will cease to exist, just that its market share will likely decrease.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka felang, morago ga thulaganyo e ntšha?","The correct answer is **C: Kgololosego ya AOL ya go tlhabolola mmaraka ka lebelo la yone** (AOL's ability to quickly dominate the IM market).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka thulaganyo eno e e dirilweng, kgololosego eno e ka nna ya fela."" (With this arrangement, this ability could end). The ""kgololosego eno"" refers to AOL's previous speed in dominating the IM market due to its widespread use in the United States.  The arrangement (presumably a partnership or competition with Yahoo! and Microsoft) is expected to diminish that advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhabololo ya inthanete e aname mo Dinageng tse di Kopaneng tsa Amerika** (Internet development in the United States) - The passage doesn't suggest internet development itself will end.
*   **B: Tiriso ya mmaraka wa IM** (Use of the IM market) -  IM use isn't predicted to end, just AOL's dominance of it.
*   **D: Tirisanommogo ya Yahoo le Microsoft** (Collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft) - The passage mentions their combined numbers competing with AOL, but doesn't say the collaboration *will* end.



"
"Ke batho ba le bakae ba ba bolailweng mo tlhaselong, ba e neng e se mapodisi?","The correct answer is **A: 19**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the bombing killed **two police officers** and injured **over twenty people**.
* It then specifies that **nineteen** of the injured were police officers.
* Therefore, the number of people killed who were *not* police officers must be the total killed (2) minus the police officers killed (2).  That leaves 0 people who were not police officers killed.
* The question asks for the number of people killed *who were not police officers*. The passage states that there were two fatalities and both were police officers.

Therefore the answer is A: 19."
Ke mang yo o begileng mmelaelwa mo tlhaselong?,"The correct answer is **A: Mapodise**.

The text states ""mo mosong e ne ya bolaya mapodise a le mabedi mme ya gobatsa batho ba feta masome a mabedi"" and later clarifies that ""mo ba le lesome le borobabongwe ja ba ba gobetseng e ne e le mapodisi."" This directly indicates the police were the victims of the attack.



"
"Ka ntlha ya maemo a Florida, a naga e e tsayang gotlhe fa e fenya,ke eng se se abetsweng Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **B: Tlhopho ya Lekoko la Republican**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Florida ne gilè baemedi ba bona go Romney, bamosusumetsapele jaaka moetapele bakeng sa go tlhophelwa Republican Party.""  This translates to ""...Florida denied its delegates to Romney, recommending him as a leader for the Republican Party nomination."" This means Florida essentially endorsed Romney as the Republican Party's frontrunner/candidate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba 32 ba baemedi ba puso:** While the text mentions Newt Gingrich received 32% of the vote, the passage says Florida gave its *delegates* to Romney, not that Gingrich secured 32 delegates.
*   **C: Baemedi botlhe ba puso:** The passage doesn’t indicate Romney received *all* the delegates, only that Florida recommended him.
*   **D: Diperesente di le 46 tsa diboutu:** While Romney won 46% of the vote, the important outcome was the support he gained *towards the nomination* (delegates)."
"Go ya ka temana,Gingrich o bone diperesente di le kae tsa diboutu mo ditlhophong tsa go itlhophela ntlhopheng yo ba mo ratang?","The correct answer is **B: Diperesente di le 32**.

The text states: ""Mmueledi wa pele wa U.S. wa House Newt Gingrich o tshotse maemo a bobedi ka diperesente di le 32."" This directly answers the question."
"Go ya ka temana,ke mang a sa tswelelang ka bontlhopheng morago ga dipholo tsa khokhase?","The correct answer is **A: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Morago ga maduo a tswa, Gingrich o ile a akgola Santorum..."" This indicates Gingrich reacted negatively *after* the results (the polls/losses) were announced, showing he didn't fare well and was responding to a setback.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bachmann:** The text says she ""tsaya tshwetso ya go emisa letsholo,"" meaning she withdrew, but it doesn’t necessarily mean she did poorly *immediately* after the results.
*   **C: Perry:** The text simply lists him as one of the candidates, and doesn't mention his immediate reaction to the results.
*   **D: Romney:** The text states Gingrich accused Romney of unfair attacks, but doesn't suggest Romney himself struggled after the polls.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o tlotlomaditseng ntlhopheng yo mongwe morago ga dipholo tsa khokhase?","The correct answer is **A: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bachmann, yo o gapileng sefoka se Ames Straw Poll ka Phatwe, o ile a tsaya tshwetso ya go emisa letsholo."" This means Bachmann *won* (or ""excelled in"" - ""gapileng"") the Ames Straw Poll and then announced she was suspending her campaign.  This indicates she had a moment of success (winning the poll) *after* the earlier results (the series of finishes mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gingrich:** He criticized Santorum *after* the results, not experienced a boost in status.
*   **C: Romney:**  He was the target of attacks, not someone who benefited from a win.
*   **D: Perry:** The text doesn't mention him achieving any success after the initial results.



"
Lefelo le le lengwe fela foo lenaneo le neng le bontshiwa pele ga 2015 e ne e le kae?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tshimologong, lenaneo leno le ne le gasiwa fela mo tsebeng ya nthanete ya seromanowa sa Toginet..."" This translates to ""Initially, this program was only broadcast on the internet station of Toginet radio..."" 

Therefore, before 2015, the program was only shown on TogiNet Radio.



"
Seteišene se tlhalosa lenaneo jaaka le le sekametseng letlhakoreng lefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Magogorwane**.

Here's why:

The passage states the program initially ""tshameki ba mantswe ba bogogorwane ba ba tswang botlhaba ba Texas"" - which translates to ""featured rare, small-town characters from East Texas.""  ""Bogogorwane"" directly translates to ""rural"" or ""small-town"" and implies a focus on a particular type of character.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go nna matwetwe mo lefapheng le le rileng (Being obscure in a rural area):** While the setting is rural, the description isn't about *being* obscure, but about the *characters* being from that area.
* **C: Go rata dilo tsa bogologolo (Loving old things):** The passage mentions the program being ""a legacy program,"" but doesn't state the characters themselves love old things.
* **D: Tsa selegae (Local):** While the characters are *from* a local area, the key characteristic highlighted is their *rarity* and *small-town nature*.



"
"David Headley o kokoantse eng e, mo bofelong, e thusitseng tlhaselo ka setlhopha sa balwelakgololosego?","The correct answer is **A: Tshedimosetso** (Information).

Here's why:

The passage states that the investigation into David Headley *led to the arrest of 10 terrorists* from the Pakistani militant group. This means Headley provided information that helped identify and connect the attackers to the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, ultimately aiding the investigation into the attack.  The other options are things *used* in the attack, but Headley provided the *information* that helped link it all together.



"
Ke mokgwa ofe wa dipalangwa o o neng o dirisiwa ke setlhopha sa balwelakgololosego go tsaya loeto go ya kwa Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokoro**.

The passage states: ""Batlhasedi ba Mumbai ba gorogile ka **sekepe** ka kgwedi ya Ngwanatsele a tlhola matsatsi a le 26 ka 2008..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived by **boat** on November 26, 2008...""

Therefore, they used a boat (mokoro) to travel to Mumbai.



"
"Ke mafoko afe a a bontshang ka go nepagala,dipholo tsa motshameko wa Nadal le Raonic tsa Brisbane Open, tse di umakilweng mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic o fentse Nadal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nadal o kgobokantse dintlha tsa 88% mo motshamekong, a fenya ka dintlha di le 76 mo karolo ya motshameko ya ntlha. **O fentswe mo malobeng ke Raonic kwa Brisbane Open.**""  This clearly indicates Raonic won *against* Nadal in the Brisbane Open.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the text mentions 88% points won by Nadal, it doesn't say Raonic had that percentage.
*   **C:** The text states Nadal was defeated, not that he won.
*   **D:** Nadal won 76 points, not Raonic.



"
"Go ya ka temana, kemo ya motshameko wa Nadal le Raonic e ne e le jang morago ga go thankgololwa?","The correct answer is **D: Raonic o fentse Nadal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nadal o fentswe mo malobeng ke Raonic kwa Brisbane Open.""  This directly translates to ""Nadal was defeated in the matches by Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text states Nadal won 88% of points *on his serve*, not Raonic.
* **B:**  The text says Nadal *won* 76 points in the first set, but this doesn’t describe the overall outcome of the match.
* **C:** 7-2 refers to the score in one game, not the overall result of the match.



"
"Ke lenaneo lefe la puo, le le sa akaretswang mo dikgasong tsa ntha tse tharo tsa Naked News?","The correct answer is **A: Se-Italy**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News *already* broadcasts in Setswana and Japanese, and is *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean. This means Italian is the only language listed that wasn't already part of their broadcasts.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae foo dikgaso tsa Naked News tse disha di ka se bonweng gone?","The correct answer is **D: Thelebišene**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Naked News is ""tshoma dithulaganyo tsa puo ya se-Spain, se-Italy le se-Korea **tsa thelebishini**, maranyane le megala ya letheka."" This means the new language additions will be available on television.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Megala ya letheka:** While mentioned, it's *along with* television, not the primary place to find them.
*   **B: Inthanete:** The passage doesn't mention the internet.
*   **C: Mafelo a bobogelo:** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Ke bagaisani ba ba kae ba ba sa fetsang Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""fa ba le 45 mo go 117 ba ba neng ba tseneletse Giant Slalom ba paletswe ke go bona maemo mo kgaisanong."" This directly translates to ""of the 117 who entered the Giant Slalom, 45 failed to finish.""

Therefore, 45 skiers did not finish the Giant Slalom.



"
"Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang, e e bontshang ka go nepagala,dipholo tsa mabelo kwa Bommampoding?","The correct answer is **B: Batshameki ba skii ba le 45, ga baa fetsa metshameko ya bona mo Giant Slalom**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""fa ba le 45 mo go 117 ba ba neng ba tseneletse Giant Slalom ba paletswe ke go bona maemo mo kgaisanong."" This means 45 skiers did not finish the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says Carpanedoo was *behind* Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary, not ahead.
*   **C:** The text doesn't give enough information to compare how many skiers finished each race. We only know 33 couldn't finish Slalom and 45 didn't finish Giant Slalom.
*   **D:** The text states Carpanedoo finished *tenth* in Giant Slalom, not Slalom. He struggled to finish Slalom.



"
Ke ofe wa ba ba latelang yo NBA e sweditseng go mo sekega?,"The correct answer is **B: Motshameki yo o tswang Utah Jazz**.

Here's why:

The text states the NBA suspended its season because **a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19**.  The question asks who the NBA suspended play for.  Therefore, the Utah Jazz player is the direct reason for the suspension.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paka ya baseketebolo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a basketball.
*   **C: Motshameki mongwe le mongwe yo go tlhomamisitsweng gore o na le COVID-19** - The suspension was triggered by *one* player, not all players testing positive.
*   **D: Setlhopha sa baseketebolo sa Utah Jazz** - While the team is affected, the suspension was specifically because of a *player* on the team testing positive."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se neng sa dira gore go nne le matshwenyego mo NBA mabapi le mogare?","The correct answer is **D: Go tlhomamisitswe gore motshameki wa Utah Jazz o na le mogare** (It was confirmed that a Utah Jazz player had the virus).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states the NBA suspended its season ""fa mongwe wa batshameki ba Utah Jazz a tshwarwa ka mogare wa COVID-19"" (after a Utah Jazz player was *confirmed* to have COVID-19).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say *players* were confirmed to have it, just one player.
* **B:**  It doesn't mention *several* players, only one.
* **C:**  It doesn't say the player was feeling unwell, just that they were confirmed positive.



"
Ke mang yo o nositseng nno e e tlisitseng phenyo mo motshamekong wa Washington Capitals kgatlhanong le Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ovechkin o simolotse ka go thusa Nicklas Backstrom go nosa sego joo."" (Ovechkin started by assisting Nicklas Backstrom to score a goal.) However, it *also* states Ovechkin scored *two* goals, and the second goal was the one that brought him to 30 goals for the season.  The question asks who scored the goal that brought the Capitals to victory, and Ovechkin's 30th goal is highlighted as significant.

While Backstrom scored a goal *assisted* by Ovechkin, Ovechkin himself scored the goal that put them ahead. Jagr and Lemieux are mentioned as comparisons to Ovechkin's achievement, but they didn't score in this game.



"
Ke mang yo a nositseng nno ya gagwe ya bo 60 ya paka mo motshamekong wa Capitals kgatlhanong le Thrashers ?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""Ovechkin o simolotse ka go thusa Nicklas Backstrom go nosa sego joo. Nno ya gagwe ya bobedi bosigong joo, e ne e le wa gagwe ya bo masome-a-marataro mo pakeng eo."" This directly translates to ""Ovechkin started by assisting Nicklas Backstrom to score. His second goal of the night was his 60th of the season."" 

Therefore, Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in the Capitals game against the Thrashers.



"
Banka ya Northern Rock e tlhokile neng tshegetso go tswa kwa pusong?,"The correct answer is **A: Morago ga gore banka e dirwe ya bosetšhaba**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Banka ya Northern Rock e dirilwe ya bosetšhaba ka 2008 morago ga go senolwa gore setheo seo se amogetse tshegetso ya tshoganyetso gotswa kwa Pusong ya UK.""  This means the nationalization *happened after* the bank received support from the government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The split into ""good bank"" and ""bad bank"" happened *after* the initial nationalization.
*   **C:** Virgin Group didn't buy the entire bank initially, only the ""good bank"" much later.
*   **D:** While the problems with mortgages *led* to the situation, the government support came *after* the bank was already in trouble, and *after* it was nationalized.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke afe a mafoko ano, a a tlhalosang ka nepagalo, tirisano ya Virgin Group le banka ya Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group, gape, e rekile setheo sa tsamaiso ya dithuo ya Northern Rock**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Virgin o rekile """"banka e e molemo"""" fela ya Northern Rock, e seng kopone ya tlhokomelo dithoto."" This means Virgin bought the part of Northern Rock that dealt with good loans (asset management).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text states Virgin's bid to buy the bank was *rejected* before it was nationalized.
*   **C:** The text says Northern Rock *received* support from the government, not Virgin.
*   **D:** The text says Virgin made a bid, but it wasn't about setting a price *after* nationalization, but *before*.



"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng, ke setšhaba sefe se se angwang ke go saeniwa ga tumalano ya Kyoto ya maemo a bosa ?","The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tse di Kopaneng (United Nations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the US, the *only* developed nation not signing the Kyoto Protocol, was withdrawing because of the agreement. This implies the Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement orchestrated through the UN. While Australia also initially refused to ratify, the primary point is the impact of the US *not* being part of the UN-backed agreement.  The question asks what is being impacted by the non-signing, not who refused to sign.



"
Puso ya pele ya Australia e ne e akanya gore go dumalana ka go saena ga Kyoto go ka senya eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Itsholelo ya lefatshe** (Australia's economy).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Puso ya pele ya boratangwao ya Australia e ganne go dumalana le Kyoto, e supa fa leano le le tla senya **itsholelo ya lefatshe e e ikaegileng** ka go rekisa magala..."" 

This directly translates to ""The first government of Australia refused to agree with Kyoto, indicating that the plan would damage **the independent economy of the country** by selling coal...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: United States:** While the passage mentions the US, Australia's concern wasn't about damaging the US.
*   **C: Go rekisa magala:** Selling coal was *how* they believed the economy would be damaged, not *what* would be damaged.
*   **D: Maikaelelo a kgotlelo ka mesi:** The passage says India and China weren't burdened by these constraints, but it doesn't state Australia thought Kyoto would harm these targets.



"
"Bahudi ba ba neng ba le mo tselaneng, ba ne ba thapetswe lenaneo lefe?","The correct answer is **A: Lenaneo la Australia la Sporting Shooters Association**.

The text states: ""...baithaopi ba ba maleba ba ne ba thapiwa, ka lenaneo la go tsoma la mokgatlho wa motshameko wa bahudi.""  This translates to ""...the hunters were given, through the training program of the sporting shooters association.""  Therefore, the program they were given was the Australian Sporting Shooters Association's training program.



"
"Ke mafoko afe a a sa bontsheng ka nepagalo,teko ya go laola disenyi?","The correct answer is **A: Ka fa e ne e le tekeletso ya lenaneo, ga le a ka la sekasekiwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the operation was *intended* to control feral animals and was closely monitored (""Ka tekeletso e ene e etswe tlhoko le go go sekaseka maduo a yone."").**  Option A directly contradicts this by saying it wasn't monitored.  This makes it the statement *not* supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported:

* **B: Bahudi ba ne ba bona taelo ya thupiso (The natives received training instructions):** The passage says they received ""full instruction and direction.""
* **C: Bahudi ba ne ba beilwe leitlho ke batlhokomedi ba diphologolo (The natives were monitored by wildlife officers):**  This is directly stated in the first sentence.
* **D: Bahudi ba le bane ba ne ba tlhophiwa (Four natives were selected):**  The passage states “bahudi ba le bane ba ba tlhophilweng go tsenelela tsamaiso ya ntlha ya go hula ba ne ba amogela...” (four natives selected to participate in the initial hunting system accepted…)



"
"Go ya ka temana, kgaogano e diragetse neng?","The correct answer is **B: Mo bonelong ja matlapa a bogologolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fa go remeletswe mo bonelong ja matlapa a bogologolo, go supega go re go kgaogana go diragetse pele ga nako e neng e akantswe fa go lebilwe bosupi jwa di-molecule.""  This directly translates to ""When it was discovered in the bones of ancient fossils, it turned out that divergence happened before the time previously thought when molecular evidence was examined.""

The text specifically links the divergence to the discovery *in the bones of ancient fossils*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rift Valley** - Rift Valley is where the research service is *located*, not when the divergence happened.
*   **C: Mo bosuping ba dimolekhule** - Molecular evidence was used to *date* the divergence, but the divergence itself happened earlier, in the fossils.
*   **D: Kwa Ethiopia** - Ethiopia is the location of the research service, not the timing of the divergence.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se diragetseng ka bonako go feta ka fa go neng go lebeletswe ka teng?","The correct answer is **B: Kgaogano (Separation/Divergence)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa go remeletswe mo bonelong ja matlapa a bogologolo, go supega go re go kgaogana go diragetse pele ga nako e neng e akantswe fa go lebilwe bosupi jwa di-molecule.""  This translates to: ""Upon examination of the fossil bones, it appears that divergence occurred earlier than previously thought based on molecular evidence.""

The passage specifically highlights that the *timing* of the divergence (kgaogano) was earlier than expected. The other options are either part of the context or the method used to discover this, but not what *happened* unexpectedly.



"
Motshameki o tla tlhoka go dira eng gore a laole dikgato le metsamao mo motshamekong wa bidio?,"The correct answer is **D: Sutisa sediriswa se mo moweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Se se tla kgontsha batshameki go laola dikgato le metsamao mo metshamekong ya ”di-video games”, **ka go sutisa sedirisiwa se mo moweng**.""  This directly explains how players will control actions in the game – by moving the controller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Netefatsa gore disensara tsa molaodi di beilwe gaufi le khonsole** - The sensors are near the TV, not the console.
*   **B: Go kgaoganya lefelo le mo go lone seraro** - This is *what the sensors do*, not what the player does.
*   **C: Baya disensara gaufi le thelebišene** - This is a setup step, not the action of controlling the game.



"
Ke eng se se dirilweng gore se tshwane le selaola thelebišene?,"The correct answer is **A: Disensara tse pedi tsa selaodi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go tshwana le selaola thelebishene, selaodi se dirisa disensara tse pedi tse di beilweng gaufi le modirisi wa thelebishene...""  This means the two sensors are what make it similar to a television remote."
Ke eng se se neng se sa buiwa mo pegong ya moragonyana ya ditheo tsa dikgang tsa Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Sefofane se ne sa kotama mo Ürümqi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *initial* reports said the plane was denied landing in Ürümqi. The *later* reports don't mention anything about Ürümqi; they focus on the plane receiving threats and being diverted to Kandahar.  Therefore, the later reports *didn't* say the plane had attempted to land in Ürümqi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sefofane se ne se amogetse matshosetsi a bomo** - This *is* mentioned in the later reports.
* **C: Sefofane se ile sa busetswa morago kwa Afhanistan** - This *is* mentioned in both reports.
* **D: Sefofane se ne sa kotama kwa Kandahar** - This *is* mentioned in the later reports.



"
Ke eng seo se neng se sa buiwa mo pegong ya ntlha ya ditheo tsa dikgang tsa Xinhua ?,"The correct answer is **A: Sefofane se ne sa gapiwa ka dikgoka**.

Here's why:

The passage states Xinhua *initially* reported the plane was seized with explosives. The later reports added details about the bomb threat, the diversion to Afghanistan, and the denial of landing in Ürümqi.  Therefore, the initial report *did not* mention the plane being seized with explosives. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The initial report *did* mention the plane being diverted back to Afghanistan.
* **C:** The initial report *did* mention the plane being diverted back to Afghanistan.
* **D:** The initial report *did* mention the plane received a bomb threat.



"
Ke eng se se neng sa phatlhaladiwa ke Sara Danius mo thulaganyong ya seromamowa?,"The correct answer is **D: Komiti e tla emisa maiteko a go ikgolaganya le Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Sara Danius said, ""Mo nakong ya gompieno ga re dire sepe"" (Currently we are doing nothing) and that they are waiting for responses from those who work with Dylan, and that what they are doing is ""not enough."" This clearly indicates they are pausing their efforts to contact Bob Dylan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mofenyi wa Sekgele sa tsa Bokwadi sa Nobel:** While the passage mentions the Nobel Prize, Danius isn't announcing the laureate, she is talking about contacting one *after* he has been awarded the prize.
*   **B: Komiti ga e a bona diphetolo go tswa go ba ba dirisanang thata le ene:** The passage states they *are* receiving responses, but those responses aren't ""promising"" enough.
*   **C: Batlhophiwa ba 2016 ba Sekgele sa Bokwadi sa Nobel:** The passage confirms Dylan won in 2016 but doesn't focus on announcing the winners. It’s about the *attempt to contact* the winner.



"
Ke mang yo go neng go pala go mo fitlhelela?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo o dirisanang le Bob Dylan thata** (Those who work closely with Bob Dylan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ka ba nna ba palalwa ke go mo fitlhelela"" which translates to ""...because they were having trouble reaching him."" and then Sara Danius says she's ""sending emails to those who work closely with him hoping to receive changes.""  This clearly indicates they are having trouble contacting *people around* Bob Dylan, not Bob Dylan himself, Sara Danius, or the Swedish Academy directly.
"
"Ke mang a rebotseng maitlamo, a re ke “kgatelopele”?","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states: ""Moanamisa mafoko wa ga Bush, **Gordon Johndroe** o rebotse maitlamo a Korea bokone """"kgatelopele ya maikaelelo a go atlega go emisa tiriso ya dibetsa ke ba Korea peninsula."""""". This directly identifies Gordon Johndroe as the one who rebuffed the North Korean claims, calling them ""kgatelopele"" (a dead end).
"
Ke ditempe di le kae tse Słania a di diretseng dinaga tse dingwe?,"The correct answer is **D: Go ka feta 1,000**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""O diretse lefatshe la Sweden ditempe di ka feta 1,000 le dinaga tse dingwe di le 28.""  This translates to ""He created more than 1,000 stamps for the country of Sweden and 28 other countries."" 

While it doesn't give an *exact* number for the other countries, it explicitly says ""more than 1,000"" total, meaning the number for other countries must be substantial and therefore ""more than 1,000"". Options A and C are too specific, and B is incorrect as it only refers to Sweden.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka bong se baka go dutla mo go tswelelang ga tanka ya letsha?","The correct answer is **C: Go buduloga ga sediriswa se se laolang botsididi le molelo mo teng ga tanka**.

The passage states: ""Go tloga ka Laboraro phirimane, tanka ya letsha e ne e ntse e dutla, **gongwe e le ka ntlha ya go buduloga ga sedirisiwa se se laolang botsididi le molelo mo teng ga tanka**."" 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention the second storage location being full.
*   **B:** The passage says the past tests of the fire control machine caused the valves to open, not directly caused the tank to drain.
*   **D:** The fire was at pump station 9, not directly related to the tank draining."
Goreng di-valve di ile di a bulega?,"The correct answer is **B: Go ne ga nna le kgaogo ya motlakase fa morago ga teko ya ka gale ya motshini o o laolang molelo**.

The passage states: ""Go kgaoga ga motlakase go go diregileng morago ga diketo tsa ka gale tsa motshini o o laolang molelo di bakile gore di-valve di bulege..."" This directly explains why the valves opened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While a sensor malfunction is mentioned, it's regarding a *level sensor* in the tank, not the initial cause of the valves opening.
*   **C:** The passage mentions the tank was *filling* (not full), which contributed to the problem, but didn't *cause* the valves to open.
*   **D:**  The second spill being under capacity is a separate issue; it doesn't explain why the initial valves opened.



"
"Ga jaana, metsi a kwa Wateng ya borobongwe, a tsamaya go fitlha kae?","The correct answer is **A: Dikgato di le 20**.

The text states: ""Wate ya borobongwe, e e boneng merwalela e e bogodimo jwa dikgato dile 20 ka nako ya kgwanyape ya Katrina, ga jaana metsi a teng a a tsamaya go fitlha mo nokeng mo gonne maparego a a gaufi a ile a tlala phetelela."" This directly states the water travelled up to 20 feet (dikgato dile 20).
"
"Ka nako ya Kgwanyape ya Katrina, go diragetse eng mo Wateng ya borobongwe?","The correct answer is **C: Metsi a morwalela a ne a le bogodimo jwa dikgato di le 20**.

The passage specifically states ""e e boneng merwalela e e bogodimo jwa dikgato dile 20 ka nako ya kgwanyape ya Katrina.""  This directly answers the question about what happened at the Wateng during Katrina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the water overflowed the levees (width of 100), this isn't the *first* thing that happened specifically mentioned in relation to the Wateng.
*   **B:** The statement about the river and nearby parishes is related to the overall situation, but doesn’t specifically describe what happened *at the Wateng*.
*   **D:** This statement is about an engineering assessment, not a specific event during Katrina at the Wateng.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e sa tlhomamisiwa ke Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko molwetse a kileng a tseela loeto teng**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hamilton *received* information about a student who had traveled. It doesn't say Hamilton investigated *where* the student travelled, only that the student had been to Nigeria where there was an Ebola outbreak. 

The passage *does* mention Hamilton addressing:

* **B:** The potential for other patients to be infected (through the isolation and contact tracing procedures).
* **C:** That appropriate systems were followed (the disease control measures).
* **D:** The severity of the disease (being in ""critical condition"").

Therefore, the only thing not confirmed as being addressed by Hamilton is the *location* of the patient's travel."
Ke eng sengwe se borasaense ba batlang go se tlhaloganya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka fa Lefatshe le bopilweng ka teng**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists hope to understand *how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed*, and that stars collided with Earth early on. This directly relates to the Earth's formation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa dinaledi tsa motšhotšhonono di thulana le Lefatshe:** While mentioned, this is *part of* understanding Earth's formation, not the main thing they're trying to understand.
*   **B: Ka fa diporoteini di dirwang ka teng:** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.
*   **C: Se dibodi e leng sone:** This is also not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke seabe sefe se mapodise a selegae se nnileng le sone mo go tswaleng?","The correct answer is **A: Ba ikuetse go FBI go tswalela** (They cooperated with the FBI to arrest).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Fa ba melao ba sa itse boleng jwa matshosetsi, Transportation Authority ya Maryland e ile ya tswalela ka go gakala ga mapodisa a FBI."" This translates to ""When they broke the law without knowing its value, the Maryland Transportation Authority arrested with the cooperation of FBI police.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ba sweditse go tswalela** (They hesitated to arrest) - The passage doesn't mention any hesitation.
*   **C: Ba ne ba kaela bakgweetsi ba dijanaga go ya ditseleng tse dingwe** (They were redirecting commuters to other roads) - The passage mentions redirecting traffic *after* the arrests to manage congestion, not as the reason for the arrests.
*   **D: Ba begile tiego ya pharakano mo tseleng e nngwe** (They caused a traffic jam on one road) - The passage states there *was* a traffic jam, but it wasn't the cause of the arrests, it was a result of them.



"
Go diragetse eng ka matseno a diphanele ka nako ya go tswala?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba ne ba thibelwa go tsena** (They were prevented from entering).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go na ga dirisiwa diteraka tsa matlakala go thiba dikgoro tsa teng"" which translates to ""Barricades were used to prevent access to the lanes"". This directly means the lanes were blocked, preventing people from entering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba ne ba dirisiwa jaaka tsela e e motsopadia** (They were used as a new route) - The passage describes *blocking* lanes, not re-routing traffic *through* them.
* **C: Di ne di buletswe bakgweetsi ba dijanaga** (They were shot by armed people) - There is no mention of shooting or armed people in the passage.
* **D: Go ne go na le pharakano e e kitlaneng go ya** (There was heavy traffic going) - The passage states there *was* a traffic jam *before* the barricades were put up, but it doesn't say the barricades themselves *caused* heavy traffic going. They were meant to *stop* traffic.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se sa diragalang pele ga fa motsayaditshwantsho a thulwa ke sejanaga?","The correct answer is **A: Motsayaditshwantsho o ne a laelwa ke Highway Patrol gore a boele morago, go kgabaganya tsela.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...se se ne sa gwetlha ba lephatha la sepodisi sa tsela sa California go mo emisa gore a boele morago ka makgetlho a le mabedi."" This directly translates to ""this led to the California Highway Patrol stopping him to turn back twice.""  This happened *before* he was arrested.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While true, it doesn't describe what happened *before* the arrest. It's part of the events leading *to* being pulled over.
* **C:** The text doesn't say the photographer took pictures *of* being pulled over.
* **D:** The text doesn’t state that the photographer managed to take a photo of Bieber. It states Bieber released a statement.



"
Motsayaditshwantsho o ne a leka go dira eng pele ga fa a thulwa ke sejanaga?,"The correct answer is **A: Emisa sejanaga mo Sepulveda Boulevard**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""motsaya dinepe one a emisa koloi ya gagwe fa thoko ga Sepulveda Boulvelda a bo a leka go tsaya senepe sa mapodisi."" This translates to ""the photographer stopped his car on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard and then tried to take a picture of the police.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text doesn't say he was photographing police stopping someone else.
*   **C:** The text doesn't mention anything about a large, speeding car.
*   **D:** The text doesn't suggest he was trying to negotiate with the police.



"
"Ke mafoko afe a a sa tlhaloseng ka go nepagala, maemo a moporesidente morago ga fa go tlhomamisitswe gore o na le mogare?","The correct answer is **C: O mo maemong a a tlhomameng**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Seemo sa moporesidente se tlhomame"" which directly translates to ""The president's condition is stable."" This is the most accurate description of his state after being diagnosed with the virus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga a ikutlwe sentle** - While he mentions feeling unwell (""Ke fela go ikutlwa sentle""), the overall message is that his condition is *stable*, not just that he feels bad.
* **B: Kgokgotso ya gagwe e botlhoko** - The passage says ""mometso o o botlhoko"" (difficult moment), referring to the diagnosis itself, not his emotional state.
* **D: O na le letshoroma** - The passage clearly states he has ""mogare"" (the virus), not a ""letshoroma"" (wound).



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, ka moporesidente, a e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: O ikutlwa sentle mo e leng gore a ka direla kwa gae** (He feels well enough to work remotely).

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Ke ikutlwa sentle e bile ke siame go re ke dire tiro ya me ka kgolagano ya mogala"" - which translates to ""I feel well and am ready to do my work remotely.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ga a na letshoroma** (He has no fever) - The text doesn't mention whether he has a fever or not.
*   **B: O tla nna a ntse kwa gae dibeke di le mmalwa** (He will stay at home for several weeks) - The text says ""malatsi a le mmalwa"" (a few days), not weeks.
*   **D: O ne a na le mogare o o masisi** (He had a severe illness) - The text says he had ""mogare"" (illness), but doesn’t specify if it was severe. It only says his condition is stable.



"
"Go ya ka temana, Setsuatsue sa Boboatsatsi se se bidiwang Gonu se solofetswe go tswela pele se koafala neng?","The correct answer is **B: Fa diphefo di fokotsegile go ya go dikhilomitara di ka nna 83 ka ura**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Mo mosong wa letsatsi leno, diphefo di ne di tsamaya ka lobelo la 83km/h, mme go solofetswe go re seemo se tla tswelela go tokafala.""  This directly translates to ""This morning, the winds were traveling at a speed of 83km/h, and it is **forecast** that the situation will continue to **worsen**.""

Therefore, the forecast of worsening conditions is tied to the winds being at 83km/h.  The other options don't relate to the forecast mentioned in the passage.



"
Diphefo di ne di le bonako bo bo kaakang fa Setsuatsue sa Boboatsatsi se se bidiwang Gonu se ne se le bogale thata?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimaele di le 149 ka ura** (Miles per hour 149).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...se ne se le diphefo tse di tsamayang ka lebelo la dikhilomithara di le 240 ka oura (dimmaele tse149 ka oura).""  This directly translates to winds of 149 miles per hour when the cyclone Gonu was at its strongest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dikhilomitara di le 149 ka ura:** This is incorrect, the passage specifies 240 km/h at its strongest.
*   **B: Dimaele di le 240 ka ura:** This is incorrect, 240 is the speed in kilometers, not miles.
*   **D: Dikhilomithara di le 83 ka ura:** This refers to the wind speed *later* in the day, not at its peak strength.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tseweng jaaka mokgwa wa Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: E na le disele tse dintsi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dilo tsa tlhago di ka kopana go tlhagisa maemo a a tshwanelang, a a letlang bolelela go oketsega ka tsela e e gakgamatsang."" which translates to ""Natural events can come together to create the right conditions, leading to rapid growth."" and ""e tlhagang fela ka ntlha ya tlhago mo diphologolong kgotsa dijalo tse di nang le sele ele nngwe."" which translates to ""it occurs naturally in blooms or single-celled organisms"". This implies Karenia brevis is a single-celled organism, *not* one with multiple cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ke mofuta wa bolele** - The passage explicitly states the ""red tide"" produces a *toxin* (""botlhole"") capable of killing fish and harming humans.
* **B: E ka koafatsa ditshika tsa batho** - The passage says the toxin can cause illness (""go bolaya ditshika mo bathong"")
* **D: Go diragala ka tlhago** - The passage states it occurs naturally (""e tlhagang fela ka ntlha ya tlhago"").



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang tseo Karena brevis a sa kgoneng go di dira?,"The correct answer is **B: Oketsega mo palong ka bonako mo maemong mangwe le mangwe (Increase in population predictably in all circumstances)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *Karenia brevis* blooms (""Red tide"") are caused by a combination of natural factors and only occur naturally in certain areas.  It specifically says these factors need to *combine* to create suitable conditions for *rapid* growth. This implies its growth isn't predictable or consistent, but dependent on specific circumstances.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Koafatsa ditshika mo tlhaping (Cause paralysis in shellfish):** The text directly states the toxins produced can cause paralysis in both humans and shellfish.
*   **C: Ama metsi (Color the water):** ""Red tide"" itself indicates a change in water color caused by the organism.
*   **D: Tlhagisa botlhole bo bo tlhaselang dinyurone (Produce neurotoxins):** The passage states the toxins are potent enough to cause paralysis, meaning they affect the nervous system (neurotoxins).



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa diragalang ka ntlha ya Kgwanyape e e bidiwang Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Morwalela wa mo mmileng**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""...le go fitlha gompieno, ga go na tshenyo kgotsa morwalela ope o o begilweng."" This means there have been **no injuries or deaths** reported.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go na ga pula go go solegelang molemo** - The passage describes significant rainfall (6.34 inches in one location), so rain *did* occur.
*   **B: Go na ga pula, go tsamaya le tumo ya maru** - The passage states ""Dipula dingwe e ne e le tsa matlakadibe le magadima a kgapetsakgapetsa"" which means there were heavy rains and flash floods.
*   **C: Legadima le le ipoapoeletsang** - The passage says ""magadima a kgapetsakgapetsa"" which translates to flash floods."
"Ke mafoko afe ka Kgwanyape e e bidiwang Felicia, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Santlha, e ne e tlhaotswe jaaka boboatsatsi ba diphefo tsa lobelo lo lo kwa tlase, pele ga fa e fetoga go nna setsuatsue sa Setlhopha 4**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Felicia *started* as a tropical storm and *became* a Category 4 hurricane. Option B correctly identifies that it began as a weaker system (""boboatsatsi ba diphefo tsa lobelo lo lo kwa tlase"") before strengthening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pula e e feletsang e na, e ne ya ungwela Oahu:**  The passage *does* mention heavy rain on Oahu, but doesn't say it ""flooded"" it. It says the rainfall was described as ""excessive.""
* **C: Bontsi ba setlhaketlhake bo itemogetse pula:** The passage does not mention people being affected by rain, only that rain was excessive.
* **D: Pula nngwe e ne e tsamaya le legadima:** While the passage mentions ""isolated thunderstorms and frequent lightning,"" it doesn't say the rain *travelled* with lightning.



"
"Ke mafoko afe a a bontshang ka nepagalo,dipoelo tsa Grand Prix ya Hungary ya 2009?","The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. o ne a lebogiswa tiro morago ga foo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Piquet Jr o ne a kobiwa morago ga tikologo ya Hungary ya 2009."" ""Kobiwa"" translates to ""was fired"" or ""was dismissed."" Therefore, Piquet Jr. lost his job *after* the Hungarian Grand Prix of 2009.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso o ne a amega mo kotsing** - The passage mentions Alonso being *involved in* the Singapore crash, not the Hungarian one.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. o fentse** - The passage only mentions Piquet Jr.'s involvement in an accident and subsequent dismissal, not winning a race.
*   **D: Sejanaga sa pabalesego se ne sa amega mo kotsing** - The passage doesn't mention the safety car being involved in an accident.



"
Thulano e diragetse neng?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka nako yone eo,morago ga go ema nakwana ga Alonso**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Piquet Jr. o ne a kobiwa morago fela ga kemo e khutshwane ya ga Fernando Alonso... o ne a kgona go fetela ko pele."" This directly indicates the overtake happened *after* Alonso slowed down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fa dikoloi tse dingwe di ne di tshelwa mafura:** While the cars were pitting, it wasn't *during* the pit stops that Piquet overtook, but because of the situation created *after* Alonso's stop.
*   **C: Pele sejanaga sa pabalesego se tswa:** The safety car coming out is a *result* of the incident, not the time the overtake happened.
*   **D: Morago ga fa Piquet a se na go tshela mafura:** The text doesn't mention anything about Piquet's pit stop schedule.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tsereng nako e nnye go feta ka fa babatlisisi ba neng ba dumela peleng?","The correct answer is **B: Pego ka mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi** (Hybridization of different species).

Here's why:

The text states that the new finch species originated from *only two* populations, and it was previously thought that such formation would take a *very long time*. This implies that the process happened faster than expected, likely due to hybridization (mixing) between the Darwin's finch and the large ground finch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Popo ya mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi** (Separation of different species) - The text doesn't discuss separation, but rather the *coming together* of two species.
*   **C: Go tsadisa magareng ga mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi** (Competition between different species) - Competition isn't mentioned as a factor in the speed of evolution.
*   **D: Go iphetogela ga mefuta e e farologaneng ya ditshedi** (Transformation of different species) - While evolution involves transformation, the key point here is the *speed* of the process, which is linked to hybridization.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e neng e sa begiwa ke babatlisisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Leina la mofuta o montšhwa wa ditshedi** (The name of the new species).

Here's why:

The passage states the researchers *discovered* a new species of finch, but it **doesn't mention the name** of that new species. It only refers to the parent species: *Geospiza* and *Goespiza conirostris*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mo go neng ga bopiwa mofuta o montšha wa ditshedi** (That a new species of finch was formed): The passage clearly states this happened.
*   **B: Lobaka lo tsamaiso ya go iphetogela e lo tsayang** (The time it takes for evolution): The passage says it's believed evolution takes a long time in this case.
*   **D: Dinonyane di akarediwa mo tsadisong** (The finches are studied in the research): The passage mentions researchers from Princeton and Uppsala, indicating a study was conducted.



"
CowParade e tla diriwa kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo toropong ya Bucharest**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Toropo e tla nna ya ntlha mo borwa-botlhaba jwa Yuropa go ka tshwara moletlo wa CowParade..."" and identifies the city as Bucharest.  While it *is* in southeastern Europe, the event is happening *in* Bucharest, not across the region.
"
"Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo, CowParade?","The correct answer is **D: Ke tiragalo ya bosetšhaba ya botaki e kgolo go di gaisa mo lefatsheng.**

Here's why:

The passage states ""tiragalo e kgolo ya lefatshe ya botaki"" (a major world event of art). This directly translates to a large-scale, international art event. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention any requirement for cities to be ""capable of adaptation.""
* **B:** Bucharest City Hall is *hosting* the event, not creating it.
* **C:** The passage states it will be the first in *south-eastern* Europe, not that it's held annually across the region.



"
Ke eng se se bakileng gore Russia e sekege tiriso ya di II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Kotsi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Naga ya Russia e ne ya emisa metsamao yo difofane tsotlhe tsa modiro wa II-76 ka nakwana morago ga kotsi eo."" This directly translates to ""Russia suspended all operations of Il-76 aircraft for a while after the accident.""

While the passage mentions the involvement of military personnel and investigations, the *reason* for the suspension was the accident itself.



"
II-76 ke eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Motšhini o o fofang** (Airplane).

The text states: ""Il-76 e ntse e le karolo e kgolo ya sesole sa ko Russia le sa Soviet Union..."" and describes an engine failure causing it to crash. This clearly indicates it's a flying machine.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sekepe sa ntwa sa ka fa tlase ga metsi** (Submarine) - The text talks about a crash, not a submersion.
*   **B: Tanka** (Tank) - Tanks are land vehicles, not aircraft.
*   **D: Terena** (Train) - Trains run on rails, and this text discusses something that flies.



"
Ke mang a thapileng setlhopha sa bakwadi sa The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""...o ne a ikarabelela ka go hira bakwadi ba metshamekong ba ntlha."" which translates to ""...he was responsible for hiring the first writers for the show.""  This refers to Simon.
"
"Go ya ka Fluke, ke mang a neng a mo romela ditshwaelo tse di molemo le thotloetso?","The correct answer is **D: Batho ba borre le bomme** (Men and women).

The text states: ""...tse di rometsweng ke **banna le basadi** ba tlhotlheletsa gore melemo ya thibelapelegi e tsewe jaaka dilo tse di tlhokegang mo kalafing."" This directly translates to ""...sent by **men and women** who advocate for the benefits of prevention to be known as necessary things in society.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dingaka (Doctors)** - The text doesn't specifically mention doctors.
*   **B: Balweladiphetogo ba tsa boitekanelo ba basadi (Female rape survivors)** - While the passage discusses violence against women, it doesn't state these survivors sent the encouraging messages.
*   **C: Banna (Men)** -  While men are mentioned, the messages came *from both* men and women.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo batho bangwe ba sa batleng basadi ba bua kgatlhanong le sone?","The correct answer is **B: Ditshenyegelo tsa kalafi** (The privileges of the powerful).

Here's why:

The passage states people are discouraging women from speaking out about their experiences because they fear it will threaten the ""melemo ya thibelapelegi e tsewe jaaka dilo tse di tlhokegang mo kalafing"" – the privileges of the powerful as necessary in society. This implies people don't want the status quo challenged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Motho ka mongwe, wa monna** (Each individual, a man) - While the passage mentions both men and women suppressing the women's voices, it's not about individual men specifically.
*   **C: Boitekanelo ba basadi** (Women's respectability) - The passage doesn't focus on preserving women's respectability; it focuses on preserving power structures.
*   **D: Go diragala fela** (Just happening) - This is too vague and doesn't capture the active suppression described in the text.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke polanete efe e e nang le maatla go feta?","The correct answer is **A: Lefatshe**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go na le setlhopha sa dipolanete se se bontshang matlhagatlhaga go feta Titan, mme leina la yone ke Lefatshe..."" which translates to ""There is a group of planets that show more complexity than Titan, and its name is Earth..."".  Therefore, Earth is presented as having more complexity/strength (in this context, likely referring to complexity of features).
"
"Dinoka le matsha, tse di nang le seedi se se bonalatsang di supilwe mo polaneteng efe?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly discusses Titan: ""Go ya ka kitso ya rona, go na le setlhopha sa dipolanete se se bontshang matlhagatlhaga go feta Titan..."" (According to our knowledge, there is a group of planets that shows more complexity than Titan...).  It describes features like rivers and seas (""dinoka le matsha"") on Titan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jupiter:** Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface for rivers and seas.
*   **C: Letsatsi (Sun):** The Sun is a star, not a planet, and is made of plasma.
*   **D: Saturn:** While Saturn is mentioned in relation to Titan (as Titan is a moon of Saturn), the passage focuses on Titan *having* the rivers and seas, not Saturn.



"
"Ke efe ya diphitlhelelo tseno, e e seng ka ntlha ya thibololo ya diphofa?","The correct answer is **A: Mmala wa diphuka tsa phologolo** (The color of animal feathers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...jaaka mmala le dipopego tsa tsone."" (…like their color and feathers).  This explicitly mentions color as a feature being studied, *independent* of the function of the feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlhaloganya gore diphofa di ne di sa dirisiwa mo phofong** (Understanding that feathers weren’t used for flight) - The entire passage focuses on *re-evaluating* what feathers were used for, specifically moving *away* from the assumption of flight.
* **C: Temoso ya go tlhaloganya go iphetogela ga diphofa** (A caution about understanding the evolution of feathers) - The passage *is* about understanding the evolution of feathers and how they changed over time.
* **D: Tlhomamiso ya gore di-dinosaur tse dintsi di ne di na le diphofa** (Confirmation that many dinosaurs had feathers) - The passage assumes dinosaurs had feathers and explores their function, not proving their existence.



"
Diphofa tsa di- dinosaur di ne di se na eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Rachis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka gonne diphuka tsa dinosaur di sena dithupana tse di itekanetseng, tse di bidiwang di rachis..."" (Because dinosaur feathers lacked equal pieces, called rachis...).  This directly indicates that dinosaur feathers *did not have* rachis – they were lacking them, or at least didn't have them in the same way modern bird feathers do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Barbules:** The passage doesn't mention barbules as being absent in dinosaur feathers.
*   **C: Diphofa tsa bofelo (End feathers):** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Bokafatlase ba mmala o o setlhefetseng (Bright colour patterns):** While the passage mentions colour and patterns, it doesn’t say dinosaur feathers lacked them. It says they were like ""the colour and patterns of none,"" meaning they may not have *had* vibrant colours, but it doesn’t say they were completely absent.



"
Ke efe ya mafoko a a latelang ka ZMapp e e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **B: E kgona go alafa ditshwaetsego tse di leng teng fela e sa thibele leso.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""research demonstrated it was not particularly effective at preventing death."" This contradicts option B, which claims it *does* alleviate existing infections without preventing death.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: E dirilwe ka dilwantshamalwetse** - While not directly stated, ZMapp is a treatment, and many treatments for viruses are developed using antibodies - implying it is made from antibodies.
*   **C: E dirile jaaka taolo mo tekong ya PALM** - The passage says, ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control to evaluate the efficacy of three other treatments.""
*   **D: Tshekatsheko e bontsha gore ditshiamelo tsa yone di kwa tlase go na le ka fa go neng go akangwa ka teng mo tshimologong** - The passage states it ""was not particularly effective at preventing death,"" suggesting its efficacy was lower than initially hoped.



"
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang a a tlhalosang ka nepagalo,teko ya PALM?","The correct answer is **C: ZMapp e ne e dirisiwa jaaka mola wa motheo wa teko** (ZMapp was used as a benchmark in the trial).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mo tshekatshekong ya PALM, ZMapp e ne e le one molemo o o neng o dirisiwa go tshwantshanya boleng ja melemo e meraro e mengwe."" This translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was the one treatment used to compare the effectiveness of three other treatments.""  This means ZMapp served as a *standard* or *benchmark* against which the other treatments were measured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention side effects beyond the fact that ZMapp didn't show strong efficacy.
*   **B:** While the trial *included* ZMapp alongside other treatments, it wasn’t simply *under control*; it was used for comparison.
*   **D:** The passage states ZMapp didn’t appear to be very effective at preventing death, so it wasn't shown to perform well.



"
Babatlisisi ba akanya gore tshitswana e ntšhwa e tla nna botlhokwa go gaisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dinaga tse di nang le lotseno lo lo kwa tlase** (Countries with lower resources).

Here's why:

The passage states the researchers believe the device will be helpful in ""countries with limited resources"" for early detection of diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria.  It contrasts this with the potential for more advanced treatment in developed countries (""as affordable as cancer treatment in developed countries"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dinaga tse di humileng (Developed countries):** The passage implies this technology is *more* critical for countries lacking advanced medical infrastructure.
* **C: Mo Dinageng tse di Kopaneng (In the United Nations):** The passage doesn't focus on a UN-wide impact, but specifically on resource limitations.
* **D: Yunibesithi ya Stanford (Stanford University):** While Stanford developed the technology, the passage focuses on the *impact* of the technology, not the university itself.



"
Ke mokgwa ofe o o tla dirisiwang go dira sediriswa sa tlhatlhobo?,"The correct answer is **B: Motšhini wa tlwaelo wa go gatisa wa inkjet** (A standard inkjet printer).

Here's why:

The text states the new diagnostic tool ""e ka bopiwang ka porintara fela a malatsi otlhe e e dirisang maranyane a inkjet"" which translates to ""can be formed with just a regular printer using inkjet droplets.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sente e le nngwe ya U.S.mongwe le mongwe** (One U.S. cent each) - While the tool *can* hold a single U.S. cent, it's not the method of creation.
*   **C: Ditshitswana tse di kgonang go gatisiwa** (Printable small pieces) - This is a description of the final product, not *how* it's made.
*   **D: Didiriswa tse dingwe tsa tlhatlhobo** (Other diagnostic tools) - This is too broad; the question asks about the specific method used to *create* this new tool.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe ka lobate scarps a e seng a nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Go nna gone ga tsone go kaya gore ngwedi ga o tlhaele tiro ya jioloji.**

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Kgopolo eno e ganetsana le dipego tsa go re ngwedi e tlhaela gotlhelele mo tirong ya jeoloji."" (This idea contradicts the belief that the moon has been geologically inactive.)  The discovery of these scarps *challenges* the idea of a completely inactive moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage suggests the scarps formed due to *ancient* events, but doesn't say they *necessarily* happened in the early stages.
* **C:** The passage mentions the scarps are potentially ""onaditswe ke maemo a bosha"" (affected by recent conditions), but doesn't suggest they *are* caused by shrinking. It's a possible factor, but not the main point about challenging the inactivity idea.
* **D:** The passage states the scarps were found *throughout* the moon (""gotlhe mo ngweding""), not that they are rare.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kgopolo efe malebana le dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe, e e supang gore go na le tiro ya jioloji e e diragalang mo ngweding?","The correct answer is **D: Dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe di tlhodilwe bošeng jaana.**

Here's why:

The passage states the ""mekgokolosa"" (craters) appear to be ""onaditswe ke maemo a bosa"" (affected by conditions of youth), suggesting geological activity occurred *after* the craters formed. This implies the craters aren't simply ancient relics, but were impacted in a geologically active period.  This directly supports the idea that geological processes have reshaped the surface *after* the impacts – meaning they were ""tlhodilwe bošeng jaana"" (affected/altered by youth/recent activity).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngwedi o ngotlega ka bonya , ka bonya:** The passage doesn't mention how the moon is ageing.
*   **B: Dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe di tlhodilwe bogologolo:** The passage *contradicts* this, saying the craters show evidence of more recent geological activity.
*   **C: Go na le palo e e kwa tlase fela ya dipopego tse di farologaneng tsa lefatshe mo boalong ba ngwedi:** The passage speaks to the *condition* of the craters, not their quantity.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se ka se nneng teng ka bontsi go fitlhela go bonwa molato?","The correct answer is **C: Metlotlo ya bopaki jwa dipaki tse di boneng ka matlho (Challenges to eyewitness testimony)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""bosupi bope jwa batho ba ba boneng ka matlho bo ka tswa bo kgotletswe gonne senepe sa gagwe se anamisitswe thata"" which translates to ""eyewitness testimony could be challenged because her identification was severely compromised.""  This directly refers to the reliability of eyewitness accounts being questioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ditshwaelo go ya pele (Emotional feelings)** - While emotions are likely involved, the text doesn't focus on them as a barrier to conviction.
*   **B: Dikgatiso tsa ditshwantsho (Photo identification)** -  While photo identification is mentioned, the issue isn't simply that it happened, but that it's *compromised* (anamisitswe thata - severely compromised).
*   **D: Kgatiso ya Tiro e e kwadilweng (Publication of a report)** - The text doesn't mention any published report.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se e seng bothata gajaana go batshwari ba manyibi?","The correct answer is **A: Maemo a bosa a a boitshegang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo godimo ga go thubega ga dikgapetla tsa metsi, **maemo a bosa a a sa iketlang** a kgoreletsa maiteko a go falotsa."" This means unpredictable conditions are making it harder for fishermen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bokana ba kgapetla:** The passage doesn't mention the *location* of the fishing spots as a problem.
*   **C: Bokima ba kgapetla:** While water levels are mentioned, they aren't presented as the primary difficulty. They are described as ""slightly high"" which is not necessarily a problem.
*   **D: Kgapetla e e gakologang:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the fishing spots being memorable or having a memory.



"
"Mo godimo ga gore go nne le kgapetla, ke eng gape se se amang maiteko a go namola?","The correct answer is **B: Maemo a bosa a sa iketlang**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mo godimo ga go thubega ga go thubega ga dikgapetla tsa metsi, **maemo a bosa a a sa iketlang** a kgoreletsa maiteko a go falotsa.""  This directly links the unstable conditions to making rescue efforts more difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go sa nne le ditlhokwa** - The passage doesn't mention a lack of resources.
*   **C: Go tlhoka thuso** - The passage doesn't mention a lack of help.
*   **D: Batshwari ba manyibi** - This option is irrelevant to the text.



"
Ke tumelo efe e Roberts a tilang go e tlhomamisa?,"The correct answer is **A: O dumela le tiriso ya go nna le tshwanelo ya gore dikgang tse di amang motho di nne sephiri sa gagwe**.

The passage explicitly states: ""O ne gape a tlhomamisa go re o dumelana le tiriso ya go nna le tshwanelo ya go re dikgang tse di amang motho di nne sephiri sa gagwe..."" This directly translates to ""He also affirmed that he agrees with the use of the right to privacy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Botlhokwa ba ditshwetso tse di tlhomameng tsa Kgotlatshekelokgolo** - While mentioned, it's not the *belief* he's affirming, but something he's emphasizing in relation to Roe v. Wade.
* **C: Tshimologo ya botshelo** - The passage mentions the beginning of life as a relevant question, but doesn't state Roberts' *belief* about it.
* **D: Tshiamelo ya sephiri** - While related to the correct answer, ""tshiamelo ya sephiri"" is too broad. The passage specifically refers to the *right to privacy*.



"
"Ke kgang efe e Roberts a neng a akanya gore e ka ga mekgwa e e sa siamang, mme go ka se tlotliwe ka yone?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlhomama ga ditshwetso tsa Kgotlatshekelokgolo** (Following the precedents of the Supreme Court).

Here's why:

The text states Roberts ""emphasized the importance of adhering to the precedents set by the Supreme Court."" This directly relates to his belief that existing legal standards, even those he might personally disagree with, should be respected and followed. The passage suggests he saw a problem with *departing* from those established precedents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tshwetso ya Roe kgatlhanong le Wade** (The ruling of Roe vs. Wade): The text doesn't say Roberts thought this was inherently wrong, but that he defended it initially.
* **C: Go nna le tshwanelo ya gore dikgang tse di amang motho di nne sephiri sa gagwe** (The right to privacy): Roberts *agreed* with this principle, he didn't see it as problematic.
* **D: Dintlha tse di kgethegileng tsa dikgetse** (Specific details of the cases): The passage doesn't focus on specific details, but the broader principle of respecting court precedents.



"
Ke kae mo marang a mabedi a lesedi a ageletsweng gore a lebe kwa loaping mo bosigong?,"The correct answer is **B: Go ralala toropo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Marang a mabedi a lesedi a ageletswe go re a lebe kwa loaping mo bosigong."" This directly translates to ""Two light poles were erected to look at the city in the evening."" Therefore, the lights are facing *outwards towards* the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ya kwa loaping** - This means ""going to the city"" and doesn't describe *where* the lights are positioned.
*   **C: Kwa se se totilweng ke sefofane sa jete sa ntlha** - This refers to the impact site of the first jet plane, which is where the narrator is, not where the lights are.
*   **D: Mo gareng ga serapa sa segopotso** - This refers to the middle of the memorial plaza, which is a different location from where the lights are placed.



"
"Go ya Ka temana, dikago tse dintha tse di goletseng kwa godimo di agiwa neng mo setsheng?","The correct answer is **D: Kago e tsweletse**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kago ya dikago tsa meago e kwa godimo di tsweletse kwa teng."" This directly translates to ""The shadow of the tall buildings cast there."" It doesn't specify *when* they were cast, only that they *are* cast there.  The other options are times mentioned in the text, but don't relate to the shadows.



"
Ke tshedimosetso efe e e bontshang gore The Seven Sisters ke magaga?,"The correct answer is **A: Dipharologano tsa mogote**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pharologanyo ya ditshwantsho tsa mogote le botsididi tse di tserweng bosigo le motshegare e supa fa di ka tswa e le magaga."" This translates to ""The difference in the sharpness and brightness of images taken at night and during the day suggests they could be dunes.""  This directly links the *difference in sharpness (mogote)* as evidence supporting the hypothesis that they are dunes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bophara ba matseno a legaga (Width of the geological formations)** - While the text mentions the width, it doesn't say the width *proves* they are dunes, only describes a characteristic.
* **C: Tshekatsheko ya Jioloji (Geological investigation)** - Glen Cushing's statement is a *comparison* to geological features, not a direct investigation proving they are dunes.
* **D: Ditshwantsho tsa magaga mo Lefatsheng (Images of dunes on Earth)** - The text uses Earth dunes as a *comparison point* for brightness, not as proof.



"
"Go elwa tlhoko jang, tsibogelo ya Seven Sisters go bo mogote fa bo ntse bo fetoga?","The correct answer is **B: Dikhuti tse di boteng** (Shallow depressions).

Here's why:

The passage states that Glen Cushing compares the brightness variations of the Seven Sisters to ""shallow depressions in the ground."" He specifically notes their brightness isn't consistent like larger craters, but *similar to shallow depressions*.  This directly addresses how their appearance changes with light (and therefore, suggests they are not high peaks).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Setshwantsho sa lesedi la marang a letsatsi** (Image of sunlight) - While light is mentioned, the passage focuses on *how* the sisters appear *with* changing light, not the sunlight itself.
* **C: Bophara ba magaga** (Width of craters) - The width is a descriptive characteristic, but doesn't explain the changing appearance.
* **D: Dipatlisiso tsa magaga mo Lefatsheng** (Crater research on Earth) -  This is related to the comparison Cushing makes, but isn't the *key observation* about why they appear as they do.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mafoko afe ka mmelaelwa, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **C: Lotso lwa gagwe le itsiwe ke balaodi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leina la gagwe le santse le sa itsiwe go bamolao..."" This directly translates to ""His name is still unknown to the police.""  Therefore, the statement that his identity *is* known by the police is false.

Let's look at why the other options are not the correct answer:

*   **A: O dirisitse sejanaga ka nako ya tlhaselo** - The passage doesn't mention a weapon being used.
*   **B: Gatwe o thuntshitse sethuthupi** - The passage states he *admitted* to shooting, so it's not false.
*   **D: O ne a sa gobala** - The passage explicitly states he *confessed* (gobale) that he shot.



"
Ke tshedimosetso efe tebang le tlhaselo e e tlhomamisitsweng ke balaodi?,"The correct answer is **C: Se se dirileng gore go nne le tlhaselo** (What happened that led to the attack).

Here's why:

* The text describes an attack – a man intentionally ran over three people with a car. 
* The question asks for information *about* the attack itself.
* Options A, B, and D focus on the perpetrator (individual involved, number of suspects, perpetrator's name) rather than the event of the attack.  The core information the passage provides is *what happened*.



"
Ke ditlhopha dife tse di tla tshamekang mo motshamekong kwa Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Aforika Borwa le Australia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Motshameko wa bofelo wa di series o tla diragala ko lebaleng la metshameko la Ellis Park ko Johannesburg beke e e latelang, fa setlhopha sa Springbok se tla bo se tshameka le sa Australia."" 

* **Springbok** is the South African team.
* Therefore, the final match will be between South Africa (Springboks) and Australia."
Di-Springbok di tla tshameka neng motshameko wa tsone o o latelang?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Motshameko wa bofelo wa di series o tla diragala ko lebaleng la metshameko la Ellis Park ko Johannesburg beke e e latelang, fa setlhopha sa Springbok se tla bo se tshameka le sa Australia.""

This directly says the Springboks' next match will be in Johannesburg against Australia.



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang tse seteišene sa lefaufau se kgaratlhileng ka sone ka nako ya letsholo?,"The correct answer is **A: Tshola sekgala se se siameng go tswa kwa didirisweng tsa go laola tsibogo mo difofela loaping**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Chiao le Sharipov ba begile fa ba ne ba le sekgala se se sireletsegileng go tswa go di-thruster tsa teng."" This directly translates to them using a protective shield from the thrusters.  Option A describes this - adjusting the propellant flow from the control thrusters in the aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go nna le gyroscope:** Gyroscopes are used for stability, but the passage doesn't mention them.
*   **C: Go tlhosetsa jete:** The passage does not mention jet thrust.
*   **D: Go bona gape, boikutlo jo bo tlwaelegileng:** This doesn't relate to the situation described in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana, mokgele wa letsholo la seteišene sa lefaufau e ne e le eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go konosetsa tsamao mo lefaufaung** (To disrupt movement in space).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chiao le Sharipov ba begile fa ba ne ba le sekgala se se sireletsegileng go tswa go di-thruster tsa teng"" (Chiao and Sharipov pleaded while they were in a safe haven from their thrusters). This indicates they were trying to **stop or disrupt their movement**. The fact that ground control realigned the aircraft and the station's orientation was damaged suggests a problem with controlling motion in space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go bona gyroscope e e timetseng** (Seeing a frozen gyroscope) -  While gyroscopes are important for orientation, the text doesn't mention anything about them being frozen.
*   **B: Go atamela enjene ya rokete e e dirisiwang go fetofetola lebelo la sefofane sa lefaufau** (Aiming the rocket engine used to change the spacecraft's velocity) - The text implies they *were* using thrusters, not trying to aim them.
*   **D: Go tlhotlhetsa dijete** (To analyze data) - This is irrelevant to the problem described.



"
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, ka kgetse, a e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: AOL e ne e bonwa molato** (AOL was found guilty).

Here's why:

* **The passage states AOL *created* a legal precedent to fight spam.** It doesn't say they were *guilty* of anything. In fact, they were the ones taking action *against* those sending unwanted emails.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tsheko e tshwere kwa nageng eo AOL e nang le ntlokgolo teng** (A trial was held in the state where AOL was headquartered) - The passage states Kgetse (Virginia) is where AOL is based and where the trial happened.
* **B: Katlholo e dirilwe** (A trial was held) - The passage explicitly mentions a trial occurred.
* **C: Molao tebang le le diimeili tse o di romelwang o sa batle o ne o dirisiwa mo kgetseng eno** (A law regarding unwanted emails was used in this case) - The passage describes a law to reduce spam emails being implemented in 2003.



"
"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a a tlhalosang kgetse ka nepagalo?","The correct answer is **C: Kgetse e ne ya sekiwa ka 2003**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...fa e sale molao o tsena mo tirisong ka ngwaga wa 2003."" (and the law came into effect in 2003). This directly links the case (kgetse) to being settled in 2003.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL e bonwe molato wa phasalatso ntle le tetlelelo** (AOL was found guilty of negligence without intent): The passage doesn’t state AOL was found guilty, it simply says it was the home of internet service providers that pioneered the case.
* **B: Kgetse e ne e ama batlamedi ba babedi, ba ba itlhomileng kwa pele ba ditirelo tsa inthanetse** (The case affected two claimants, pioneers of internet services): The passage mentions AOL as a pioneer, but doesn’t specify two claimants.
* **D: AOL e simolotse tsheko ya kgetse** (AOL initiated the case): The passage says AOL was *home* to the internet service providers, but doesn't indicate they started the case.



"
"Go ya ka temana, Vidal o ne a simolola go tshamekela setlhopha sefe dipaka di le tharo tse di fetileng?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states Vidal joined Barca *from* Sevilla three years ago. Therefore, he was playing for Sevilla before that.
"
Vidal o tshameketse Barça metshameko e le mekae?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Fa a sale a fudugela kwa moshateng wa ma-Catalan, Vidal o tshameketse setlhopha se makgetho a le 49."" which translates to ""After arriving at the Catalan club, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.""



"
Ke bomang ba e leng setlhopha se se emang kgatlhanong mo motshamekong?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states the match was played ""against Bolonia"" (kgatlhanong le Bolonia).  Therefore, Bolonia is the opposing team.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jarque** - Jarque is a player, not a team.
* **C: Coverciano** - Coverciano is a location (training center).
* **D: Italy** - Italy is a country, and while the training was *in* Italy, it's not the opposing team.



"
Goreng Jarque a ne a nna mo hoteleng?,"The correct answer is **A: O ne a ikatisa**.

The passage states ""Jarques o ne a ikatisa ka nako ya ikatiso kwa Coverciano kwa Italy..."" which translates to ""Jarques was training at the Coverciano training center in Italy..."". He was at the hotel *because* he was training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O ne a na le kopano ya pele ga paka** - The passage doesn't mention any meeting before the game.
*   **C: O ne a tshameka ka Sontaga** - The passage states the game was *scheduled* but doesn't specify a day.
*   **D: O ne a ikatisa le Bolonia** - He was training *against* Bolonia, not *with* them.



"
Goreng setlamo sa thutafatshe sa Jakarta se ne se sa batle go ntsha tsiboso?,"The correct answer is **D: E ne e sa fitlhelele bogolo bo bo lekaneng go nna thoromo ya lefatshe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the geologists in Jakarta did *not* issue a tsunami warning ""because the earthquake did not reach the necessary magnitude of 6.5.""  This directly explains why they didn't issue a warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ne go se na matshosetsi a tsunami:** This is a result of the earthquake not being strong enough, not the *reason* for not issuing the warning.
*   **B: Go tila ketsaetsego magareng ga baagi:** While panic *did* occur, it wasn't the reason the warning wasn't issued.
*   **C: Go tila go amega ga kgwebo ya selegae:**  The impact on local business is a consequence of the situation, not a reason for withholding a warning.



"
"Go ya ka temana, thoromo ya lefatshe e bakile eng?","The correct answer is **A: Baagi ba selegae ba ba tshogileng** (The local residents who were shocked).

Here's why:

The text states that despite the earthquake not reaching the threshold for a tsunami warning (6.5 magnitude), people *became panicked* and started evacuating.  This means the earthquake *caused* the residents to be shocked and react with fear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matshosetsi a tsunami (Tsunami warnings):** The text specifically says there were *no* tsunami warnings issued.
* **C: Tsiboso e e ntshitsweng (An announcement made):**  The text doesn't mention any announcements being made, only people reacting on their own.
* **D: 6.5 mo selekanyong sa bogolo ba thoromo ya lefatshe (6.5 on the earthquake magnitude scale):** This is the *threshold* for a warning, not what the earthquake *caused*.



"
Ke efe ya tseno e e tlhotlheletsang tiro ya Letsatsi le dinaledi tse dingwe tsotlhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Lesedi, nomoro ya Rossby, le thefosano**

Here's why:

* **Lesedi (Brightness):** The passage explicitly states the study of stars is based on *how they emit light*.
* **Nomoro ya Rossby (Rossby Number):** This is identified as being *strongly used to determine the number of Rossby stars* and is linked to magnetic field differences.
* **Thefosano (Rotation):**  The passage mentions rotation (""go dikologa"") is crucial *along with brightness* to determine the Rossby number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kelelo ya lesedi le polasema (Brightness and Plasma):** While plasma is *related* to how stars work, it's not specifically mentioned as a *defining characteristic* used in the study described.
* **B: Nomoro ya Rossy , thefosano, le phetolelo ya makenete (Rossby Number, Rotation, and Magnetic Translation):** ""Phetolelo ya makenete"" (magnetic translation) isn't directly mentioned, the passage discusses magnetic poles.
* **C: Thefosano le lesedi (Rotation and Brightness):** This misses the crucial role of the Rossby number.



"
Nomoro ya Rossby ya naledi e tlhomamisiwa jang?,"The correct answer is **C: Maemo a ya tiro**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...go phatsima le go dikologa di dirisiwa mmogo thata go bona palo ya naledi ya Rossby..."" (Spin and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number).  ""Maemo a ya tiro"" translates to ""conditions of rotation/spin"" which directly relates to how the Rossby number is calculated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lesedi le thefosano (Brightness of light):** While brightness is mentioned in relation to identifying stars, it's not directly used to calculate the Rossby number.
* **B: Bokana ba kelo ya polasema (Plasma flow rate):**  The Rossby number *correlates* to plasma flow, but isn't *determined* by it directly. It's the rotation that's key.
* **D: Bokana ba phetolelo ya makenete (Magnetic field translation):** The passage mentions magnetic poles in relation to a *low* Rossby number, but the number itself isn't determined by the magnetic field.



"
Ke peresente efe ya batho ba ba neng ba botsolodiwa e e reng Australia e nne rephaboliki ka bonako?,"The correct answer is **B: Diperesente di le 29**.

The text states: ""29% ya bone ba dumela go re Australia e tshwanetse go nna rephaboliki mo nakong e e sa fediseng pelo...""  This translates to ""29% of them believed that Australia should become a republic in the near future."" This directly answers the question of what percentage of those surveyed favored Australia becoming a republic.



"
"Go ya ka Julie Gillard, Australia e tshwanetse e nne rephaboliki neng?","The correct answer is **B: Morago ga puso ya Kgosigadi Elizabeth II**.

The text states: ""Tonakgolo wa nama-o-sa-tshwere, Julia Gillard o buile ka ipapatso ya ditlhopo tsa puso-kgolo tsa 2010 go re o dumela go re Australia e tshwanetse e nne puso ya rephaboliki fa paka ya ga Mmamosadinyana (Elizabeth II) e wela.""  This directly translates to: ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke about the results of the 2010 election saying she believes Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.""
"
Ke mokgatlho ofe o o leng ka fa tlase ga diotso-patlisiso tsa molao?,"The correct answer is **D: Komitipotlana ya Bookamedi le Dipatlisiso** (Committee on Investigations).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Stearns o batlisisa go re a madi a lekgetlo ke one a dirisiwang go duelela go senngwa ga dimpa ke Planned Parenthood mo seemong sa gagwe jaaka modulasetulo wa mokgatlho wa **Komitipotlana e e Okamelang Dipatlisiso**, o o ka fa tlase ga House Energy and Commerce Committee.""

This clearly identifies the Committee on Investigations as the body conducting the probe.  Option A, ""Komiti ya Ntlo , Maatla le tsa Kgwebo"" (House Energy and Commerce Committee) is the *parent* committee, but the specific investigation is being led by the subcommittee mentioned in the text."
Cliff Stearns ke tlhogo ya komiti efe?,"The correct answer is **D: Komitipotlana ya Bookamedi le Dipatlisiso** (Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations).

The text states: ""Stearns o batlisisa go re a madi a lekgetlo ke one a dirisiwang go duelela go senngwa ga dimpa ke Planned Parenthood mo seemong sa gagwe jaaka modulasetulo wa mokgatlho wa Komitipotlana e e Okamelang Dipatlisiso, o o ka fa tlase ga House Energy and Commerce Committee."" This directly translates to Stearns chairs the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations which falls under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng seo se sa diragalelang mosadi wa kwa Switzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Dithoto tsa gagwe tse di utswitsweng, di bonwe.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""wa mo-Swiss, e bile re ne ra bona mogala wa lethatheka le lepothopo tsa gagwe"" which translates to ""the Swiss woman, and we found her wallet and passport."" This indicates her belongings were stolen and recovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O bolailwe (She was killed):** The text doesn't mention the woman being killed.
*   **C: O ne a sotliwa ka thobalano ke batho ba ba 5 (She was sexually assaulted by 5 people):** The text doesn't mention any sexual assault.
*   **D: Mogala wa gagwe le lepothopo di ne tsa utswiwa (Her wallet and passport were stolen):** While true, the text *also* says they were *found* (di bonwe), making option A more complete and accurate.



"
Ke setheo sefe se se abetsweng Taiwan Sustainable Award ka 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mme mmaraka wa di-laptop o ya go tetolwa thata morago ga ASUS e fiwa sekgele sa Taiwan Sustainable Award sa 2007 ke khuduthamaga ya mmuso wa Republic ya China.""  This means ASUS was awarded the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007."
ASUS Eee PC ke eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Lepothopo** (Laptop).

The text explicitly refers to the ASUS Eee PC as a ""laptop"" and describes its impact on the laptop market. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mogala wa letheka** (Mobile phone) - The text doesn't mention anything about mobile phones.
* **C: tablet** - While tablets are portable computers, the text specifically refers to it as a laptop.
* **D: Hokitoki ya kgetsana** (Small computer) - This is too vague. ""Laptop"" is the precise term used in the context.



"
Ke mang a neng a rwele maikarabelo a ditokomane tse di latlhegileng tsa poso?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosimane**.

The passage states: ""ba poso ba ntshitse lekwalo la go kopa maitshwarelo mo baageding le mo mmedieng morago ga go re mosimane mongwe o ne a fitlhile ditokumente di ka nna 600 tsa poso..."" This directly identifies the boy as the one who possessed the lost documents.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Badiri ba poso:** The postal workers acknowledged the problem and apologized, but they didn't *have* the lost documents.
*   **B: Setlhopha sa baagi ba Obanazawa:** The residents were the ones *affected* by the lost mail, not responsible for it.
*   **D: Bobegadikgang:** This option doesn't appear in the context of the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a kopileng boitshwarelo tebang le ditokomane tse di timetseng?","The correct answer is **D: Kantoro ya poso ya Obanazawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maabane, ba poso ba ntshitse lekwalo la go kopa maitshwarelo mo baageding le mo mmedieng morago ga go re ba lemoge go re mosimane mongwe o ne a fitlhile ditokumente...""  This directly states the post office (*ba poso*) issued an apology. While a boy *found* the documents, the post office is the one taking responsibility and apologizing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baagi ba selegae (Local residents)** - They *received* the apology, but didn't issue it.
*   **B: Mosimane (Boy)** - The boy found the documents, he didn't apologize.
*   **C: Bobegadikgang (The culprit)** - The passage doesn’t explicitly state the boy did this intentionally and even if he did, it’s the post office apologizing for the error."
Del Potro o ne a tlhoka go mekamekana le kgang ya gagwe ya legetla neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo seteng ya bobedi**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Del Potro o ne a na le ketelo pele mo legatong la bobedi, mme se gape se tlhokane le go kgaoganya dinno morago ga go fitlhelela 6-6."" This directly translates to Del Potro having a break point in the *second set* and it being necessary to split points after reaching 6-6.  The fact that he was hampered by his wrist later in the passage doesn't change *when* the issue first arose.



"
Dipoelo tsa kgaisano ya ntlha ya go tlhomamisa mofenyi?,"The correct answer is **A: E latlhegetse Murray mo seteng ya ntlha**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Murray o latlhegetswe mo motshamekong morago ga go re banna ka bobedi ba lekalekane mo motshamekong mme ba tshameke ka gangwe.""  This directly translates to ""Murray lost the point after they were tied in the rally and played simultaneously."" This indicates Murray lost the first point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E latlhegetse Del Potro morago ga kgobalo ya gagwe:** The passage says Del Potro *recovered* after being at a disadvantage (hand disadvantage), not that he lost a point due to it.
* **C: E ne ya fenngwa ke Murrary mo seteng ya bobedi:** The passage describes events in the *first* point, not the second set.
* **D: E ne ya fenngwa ke Del Potro mo seteng ya bobedi:**  Similar to C, this refers to the second set, while the passage details the first point.



"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng,ke mang,segolobogolo, yo o neng a amana le molwetse ?","The correct answer is **B: Bana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ”Gompieno, re ithutile gore bana bangwe ba ba leng mo dingwageng tsa go tsena sekolo ba supilwe e le ba ba kopaneng le molwetse”. This directly indicates that *bana* (children) are the ones identified as having contracted the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmusi** - The passage mentions the leader (Perry) talking about the situation, but doesn't say they are affected.
*   **C: Batlhankedi ba Texas** - While the leader was visiting to discuss safety measures for Texans, the passage doesn't say they are the ones sick.
*   **D: Baagi ba selegae** - The passage is specific about children being affected, not the general population.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke netefaletso efe e mmusi a sa e dirang fa a ne a bua le banni ba kwa Texas?","The correct answer is **D: Kgetse ga e masisi**.

Here's why:

The passage *directly* quotes the governor saying ""kgetse e e masisi"" (the outbreak is serious).  Therefore, he is *not* asserting that the outbreak is *not* serious.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thulaganyo e dira sentle** - He says ""Ke tshepa go re tsamaiso ya rona e dira ka natla jaaka e tshwanetse"" (I trust our system is working as well as it should), which implies the arrangement *is* working well.
* **B: Dilo di diriwa go sireletsa pabalesego ya setšhaba** - He mentions traveling with directors to ""go tserwe dikgato go oketsa tsireletsego ya bone"" (take steps to increase their security), meaning things are being done to protect public safety.
* **C: Ba tlhomeletse go fitlhelela kgwetlho** - He warns that ""go na le mafelo a le mmalwa mo lefatsheng a a tla kgonang go emelana le dikgwetlho tsa kgetse e"" (there are few places in the world that can withstand an outbreak), implying people are vulnerable.



"
"Ke motswedi ofe wa kakgelo ya metlae, e e neng ya tlhangwa ke baithuti ba pele ba UW, ba le babedi?","The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bogologolo pele ga The Daily Show le The Colbert Report, Heck le Johnson ba ile ba akanyetsa kgatiso e e neng e tsile go fetola dikgang ka fa dikgang di begiwang ka teng—fa e ne e santse e le baithuti kwa UW ka 1988. Go tswa tshimologong ya yone, **The Onion** e itshupile fa e le mankge yo o di gagang kwa pele mo tsa dikgang...""

The passage clearly identifies The Onion as the source of the satirical news, created by Heck and Johnson while students at UW.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tseno, e e sa akarediwang mo teng ga kgwebo e kgolo ya kakgelo ya metlae ya The Onion?","The correct answer is **B: Filimi**.

Here's why:

The passage lists several aspects of The Onion's success: print publication, a large online following, personal appearances, daily news, voice recordings, and a book. It *doesn't* mention film/movies as part of their output.

Therefore, film is the only option not mentioned as being part of The Onion's business."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se neng se letetswe ke mapodise?","The correct answer is **C: Matseno a Downing Street**.

Here's why:

The passage states the police were deployed to ""the barriers outside Downing Street."" The passage then details the route taken by the demonstrators, who were heading towards a Conservative Party gathering. The police action was directly related to securing the area around Downing Street.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Square:** The demonstrators *passed through* Trafalgar Square, but it wasn't what the police were protecting.
*   **B: The Spring Forum:** The Spring Forum (the Conservative Party gathering) was the *destination* of the demonstrators, not what the police were blocking access to initially.
*   **D: Hotele ya Grand Connaught Rooms:** This is where the Spring Forum was held, but again, not the initial focus of the police deployment.



"
Mapodise a ne a kopa badiraditshupetso ka nako mang gore ba sute go tila go oketsega ga pharakano go ya pele?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka 11:20**.

The text states: ""Ka nako ya 11:20, mapodise a ne a kopa babopeledi go sutela fa godimo ga bodilo jwa letlhakore la tsela..."" which translates to ""At 11:20, police asked protesters to move to the sidewalk..."" This is when they requested the protesters to move due to increased traffic.
"
Ke eng se e leng nnete ka dipatlisiso tse di dirilweng ke Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Dipeba tse dingwe tse di neng di na le bolwetse ba sukiri ga di sa na bona**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Ur is researching *mice* that had diabetes but *no longer do*. This directly corresponds to option B. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage specifically mentions the findings might *not* apply to people with Type 1 diabetes.
*   **C:** While Dr. Ur is hopeful, the passage states he has ""doubts"" about a cure, not necessarily strong hope for one.
*   **D:** The passage focuses on mice *losing* the disease, not *gaining* it.



"
"Go ya ka temana, Dr Ur o belaela ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Dikakanyo tsa baitseanape ba bangwe tebang le kalafi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jaaka bangwe ba baitseanape, o na le dipelaelo tsa go re a bolwetse jwa sukiri bo a alafega..."" This directly translates to ""Like some researchers, he has doubts that diabetes is curable.""  Dr. Ur's doubt is *about* the claims of other researchers who believe a cure is possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa diphitlhelelo di le maleba go batho ba ba nang le bolwetse jwa sukiri jwa Type 1:** The text says the findings *may not* apply to Type 1 diabetes, it doesn't say Dr. Ur doubts their severity for those with the disease.
* **B: Fa kalafi e kgonagala:** He doubts a cure exists, not the possibility of a cure generally.
* **D: Fa dipeba tse di se nang bolwetse jwa sukiri di tsile go nna fela jalo:**  The text focuses on the study of puppies who *developed* diabetes and then seemingly recovered. It doesn’t discuss puppies who never got the disease.

"Ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a a sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo,thubagano ya Flight CG4684?","The correct answer is **A: Kwa ntlheng,sefofane se ne se sa kgone go kotama ka ntlha ya maemo a bosa**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Patlo e ile ya kgorelediwa ke seemo se se tshwanang se se sa siamang sa bosa se se bakileng go re sefofane se tlogele go kotama."" This translates to ""The investigation focused on the same incorrect wind conditions that caused the plane to fail to land.""
*   This directly links the failure to land (thubagano - crash/landing failure) to wind conditions (maemo a bosa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the crash site was difficult to access, the text doesn't say the *location* itself caused the crash.
*   **C:** The text only mentions two attempted landings, not three.
*   **D:**  The search *was* for the crash site, but the *reason* for the crash, according to the text, is the wind conditions.



"
Ke eng se se bakileng gore Flight CG4684 e emise go kotama?,"The correct answer is **D: Maemo a bosa a ne a le bokoa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Patlo e ile ya kgorelediwa ke seemo se se tshwanang se se sa siamang sa bosa se se bakileng go re sefofane se tlogele go kotama.""  This translates to: ""The investigation focused on the same incorrect weather conditions that caused the plane to abort its landing."" 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the landing strip was difficult to access, the passage doesn't state it was *impossible* to find.
*   **B:** The passage mentions another plane landed, not that multiple planes were ahead of CG4684.
*   **C:** There is no mention of a route change to Kokoda.

"Go ya ka temana,ke afe a mafoko a a latelang ka se se diragaletseng Franciszek Kowal a e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: O ne a gobale fa a leka go thuba letlhabaphefo.**

Here's why:

The passage states ""ba simolola go tswela kwa ntle ka matlhabaphefo, ga bolela mongwe wa bafalodi e leng Franciszek Kowal.""  This translates to ""they started fleeing with the money, including one of the robbers named Franciszek Kowal."" This implies he *was* fleeing *with* the money – meaning he was escaping *after* attempting to rob the bank. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O kgonne go thuba letlhabaphefo (He succeeded in robbing the bank):** The passage says the bank wasn't successfully robbed (""matlhabaphefo a ne a sa thubege"").
* **B: Mo bofelong, o ne a sa gobala (In the end, he didn't flee):** He *did* flee, as stated in the final part of the passage.
* **C: O robile setulo fa a ne a leka go tswa (He broke a chair when he tried to escape):** The passage mentions chairs being thrown *at* the windows, not broken during an escape attempt by Kowal.

Goreng go le thata go lekanya ditlamorago tse di ka nnang teng tsa Letsubutsubu la Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Letsubutsubu le kgakala thata le lefatshe le le fetang kwa godimo ga lone.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E re ka setsuatsue se le kgakala le go goroga mo lefatsheng, ga go bonolo go ka sekaseka go re ditlamorago tsa sone di tla nna jang mo lefatsheng la Amerika kgotsa kwa Caribbean.""  This directly explains that because the hurricane is distant and moving *away* from land, it's difficult to predict its impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions Danielle *could* strengthen, that's not the reason it's hard to predict impact.
* **B:** The passage doesn't say scientists are unsure about the hurricane's strength, only that it *could* strengthen.
* **D:** The passage mentions Miami, but the distance isn't the core reason for prediction difficulty. It’s the overall distance and movement *away* from land.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke afe a mafoko a a latelang, a e seng nnete, ka Letsubutsubu la Danielle?","The correct answer is **A: Khuetso ya yone go Caribbean ga e itsiwe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""E re ka setsuatsue se le kgakala le go goroga mo lefatsheng, ga go bonolo go ka sekaseka go re ditlamorago tsa sone di tla nna jang mo lefatsheng la Amerika kgotsa kwa Caribbean."" This directly translates to ""Because the storm is distant and developing, it is not easy to predict what its impacts will be in the Americas or the Caribbean."" This means the course of the storm and its effects on the Caribbean are *unknown*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E tlholegile kwa lewatleng la Atlantic** - The passage states it ""developed over the Atlantic Ocean,"" making this true.
*   **C: Le ka fetoga go nna kgwanyape** - The passage says it ""could become a hurricane,"" so this is also true.
*   **D: Le gaufi le lefatshe le le fetang fa godimo ga lone** - The passage states it's distant, meaning it's *not* close to land.

"Go ya ka temana, go tshitshinngwa gore go diragale eng ka bolwetse pele bo baka leroborobo la lefatshe lotlhe?","The correct answer is **A: E tshwanetse e nne e e seng kotsi thata**.

Here's why:

The passage states that other research ""reminds us that this disease needs to lessen greatly before it can be considered a global pandemic."" This implies that *currently* the disease isn't severe enough to cause a pandemic.  A pandemic requires widespread, severe illness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matshwao a tshwanetse a nne a ntse a se bogale thata** - The passage says symptoms are mild, not that they *need* to be mild.
* **C: Batho ba bantsi ba tlhoka go tshwaetsega** - The passage doesn't mention the need for fewer people to become infected. It focuses on the severity of the illness.
* **D: Bana ba tshwanetse go nna le matshwao** - The passage states children *are* infected, even without showing symptoms.



"
"Go ya ka temana, letsubutsubu le ne le le bokgakala jo bo kana kang go tswa kwa Fujian?","The correct answer is **C: Dikhilomitara di le 70**.

The text states the typhoon was ""bokgakala jwa dikhilomithara di le masome-a-supa"" (about 70 kilometers) from Fujian province.
"
Ke mang yo a neng a dumedisa George W. Bush fa a goroga kwa Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng le Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Bush was ""dumedisiwa ke mothusa Tonakgolo wa Singapore e leng Wong Kan Seng"" (welcomed by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng) *and* he ""buisana le Tonakgolo ya Singapore e leng Lee Hsien Loong"" (met with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tonakgolo** - While he *met* with the Prime Minister, he was *welcomed* by the Deputy Prime Minister as well.
* **B: Bareetsi** - The passage doesn't mention ""babogedi"" (dignitaries) welcoming him, only that he later spoke to them.
* **D: Motlatsa Tonakgolo** - Only the Deputy Prime Minister welcomed him upon arrival. Lee Hsien Loong was met with *after* his arrival.



"
Moporesidente o buile neng ka katoloso ya kgwebisano ya Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa morago ga go latlhegelwa ke ditlhopho tsa paka ya magareng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Morago ga go ya go latlhegelwa ke ditlhopho, Bush o ile a bolelela babogedi ka katoloso ya papadisanyo kwa Asia.""  This directly translates to ""After being greeted by the photographers, Bush told reporters about the benefits of trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa a goroga kwa Singapore** - While he arrived in Singapore, the passage doesn't say he spoke about trade *upon arrival*.
*   **B: Le Wong Kan Seng** - He discussed trade with Wong Kan Seng, but didn't publicly announce his views on it *to reporters* during that conversation.
*   **D: Go ralala loeto lwa gagwe la beke kwa Asia** - The purpose of the trip isn't where he spoke about the topic."
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e leng mokgele wa konokono wa puso?","The correct answer is **D: Fokotsa lesukasuke mo dikoloing tsa dipitse** (Reduce congestion in traffic).

Here's why:

The passage states the government is adding 300 cars to reach a total of 1300 cars ""to alleviate congestion.""  ""Alleviate congestion"" means to reduce traffic, making **D** the direct goal of the government's action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Describes *why* there's a problem (many cars), not the government's goal.
* **B:** States *how many* cars are being added, not the purpose.
* **C:** States the *total* number of cars, not the purpose.



"
Puso e itsisitse eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba rulaganya go tlamela ka matlole, dikoloi tse dingwe tsa dipitse di le 1,300**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Go tlatsa ka tse 300 go tla oketsa palo yotlhe ya dikara go nna 1300..."" This directly translates to adding 300 more cars to reach a total of 1,300 cars.
* **""Ba rulaganya go tlamela ka matlole""** means ""They plan to invest/spend money"" which aligns with adding more cars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Incorrect. The passage states 300 *additional* cars, not just any other cars.
* **B:** Incorrect. The passage doesn't say they are *solving* the problem of cars, but adding more to *lessen* congestion.
* **D:** Incorrect.  The passage mentions the problem occurred in Mopitlo, but doesn't say it will be resolved *by* Mopitlo. It's a timeframe for the *increase* in cars.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke tshedimosetso efe e e itsiweng?","The correct answer is **A: Selekanyo sa matshosetsi se fokotsegile** (The level of stress has decreased).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...phokotsego ya matshosetsi go nna selekanyo se se tseneletseng..."" which directly translates to ""...a decrease in stress to a manageable level...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga go sa na matshosetsi ape** (There is no stress at all) - The text says stress *decreased* to a manageable level, not that it's completely gone.
* **C: Tlhaselo e lebeletswe** (An attack is expected) - This is mentioned, but it's not the information specifically *revealed* by the decrease in stress.  The decrease in stress is the new information.
* **D: Ba tsa Matlhale ba tlhomamisitse gore tlhaselo e tsile go nna masisi** (Scientists have confirmed the attack has happened) -  The text states an attack is *anticipated*, not confirmed.



"
"Ke polelo efe tebang le ditshupetso, e e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Khomišine ya moporesidente e ne e le tsibogo go ditshupetso**.

Here's why:

The passage states the presidential commission *investigated* the CEPs (Provincial Electoral Councils), it wasn't a gathering *of* the protests themselves.  It was Martelly's team investigating accusations related to the protests.

Let's look at why the other options are true, based on the text:

* **B: Ditlhopho tse di diegileng, di tsositse ditshupetso** - The text says protests were sparked by delayed elections.
* **C: Ditshupetso di ne di batla gore CEP wa pele a role tiro** - The text mentions the aim of the protests was to force the CEP to work.
* **D: Ditshupetso di ne di na le tirisodikgoka ka dinako dingwe** - The passage explicitly states ""Ditshupetso tse ka dinako dingwe di nang le tirisodikgoka"".



"
Ke mang a tshitshintseng gore CEP ya bofelo e role tiro?,"The correct answer is **C: Khomišene ya moporesidente** (The Presidential Commission).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kgwedi e e fetileng komishene ya boporesidente e ne ya atlanegisa go re di-CEP di role tiro pele..."" (Last month the Presidential Commission announced that the CEPs would work ahead...). This directly indicates the Presidential Commission was the entity that said the CEPs should work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Martelly:** While Martelly appointed the CEP members, the text doesn't say *he* announced they should work.
* **B: Badiraditshupetso:** (Protesters) The text mentions protests, but doesn't link them to the announcement of the CEP's work.
* **D: Maloko a CEP a dirile tshitshinyo eo ka boone:** (CEP members made the announcement themselves) The text says the commission made the announcement, not the CEP members.

"Go ya ka temana,Ke eng seo lekgotla la USA Gymnastics le sa dumalaneng le sone, morago ga gore Nassar a kgokgontshe batshameki?","The correct answer is **C: Diphetogo tse di tlhokegang mo teng ga lekoko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics agrees with the USOC that ""interests of athletes and our organizations, and their sports, would be best served by pressing forward with transformative change within our organization, rather than certification."" This means they *don't* agree with simply getting certified without making substantial changes to how things are run.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlosa leina le o bidiwang ka lone semmuso** - The passage doesn't mention anything about removing a formal name.
*   **B: Go tlhola maemo a a maatlafaditsweng** - The passage doesn't directly discuss specific positions.
*   **D: Dipatlisiso tse di ikemetseng** - The passage actually *supports* independent investigations (""rotloetsa go re go nne le patlisiso e e ikemetseng"").

"
"Go ya ka polelo,ke eng maikaelelomagolo a USA Gymnastics gammogo le Komiti ya Di-Olimpiki ya Amerika go ya pele?","The correct answer is **D: Go tsweletsa tikologo e e sireletsegileng ya batshameki** (To promote a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC agree on the importance of fostering a safe environment for all those involved in the Olympics. They believe this is best achieved through significant change within the organization, *rather than* pursuing certification.  The passage also highlights the need for an independent investigation into how Nassar's abuse went undetected and the commitment to making meaningful changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Leba ka kelotlhoko, go sotla ga Larry Nassar (Focusing on the prosecution of Larry Nassar):** While Nassar's actions are central to *why* they are making changes, the focus of the statement is not simply prosecution, but prevention.
* **B: Go tsaya setefikeiti (Obtaining certification):** The passage specifically states they prioritize change *over* certification.
* **C: Go latelela dipatlisiso tsa sephiri (Covering up investigations):** The opposite is true - they are advocating for an *independent* investigation.



"
Sekepe se ne se ya kae fa tiragalo e diragala? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...sekepe sa teng se ne se le mo tseleng go ya **Puerto Princesa ko Palawan**."" ( ""...the ship was on its way to Puerto Princesa in **Palawan**."")

Therefore, the incident occurred near Palawan.



"
Ke eng se e seng boammaaruri tebang le sekepe se se umakilweng mo temaneng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ke sekepe sa moepo sa go thibela bothata bo bo ka tlhagang** (It is a combat ship for preventing potential problems).

Here's why:

The passage states the ship is of the Avenger class and *depicts bombed structures*. This suggests it's a warship used in conflict, not simply a general transport or patrol vessel. The passage also mentions ""pirates are still seeking a way to board the ship,"" further indicating its role in combat or security.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E ne e le mo tseleng ya go ya Puerto Princesa** (It was on its way to Puerto Princesa) - This is a stated fact in the passage, not something inaccurate.
* **B: E kwa Palawan** (It was in Palawan) - Puerto Princesa is *in* Palawan, making this a true statement, not a falsehood.
* **D: E abetswe Seventh Fleet ya masole a lewatle a U.S.** (It was assigned to the Seventh Fleet of the U.S. Navy) - While plausible, the passage explicitly states it was given to the *Seventh Fleet Group* not directly the fleet itself, but this isn't a clear inaccuracy. The description of a bombed structure ship does not align with the function of the seventh fleet.



"
Ke mang a neng a neelana ka polelo tebang le masole a ntwa a US?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text states: ""Mo phirimaneng ya letsatsi la Tshipi, tautona wa lefatshe la United States, **Donald Trump** mo pegong e ntshitsweng ke mokwaledi wa bobegadikgang, a itse fa masole a US a tla tswa kwa Syria."" This directly translates to ""On Sunday, the President of the United States, **Donald Trump** in a statement released by the White House spokesperson, announced that US troops would withdraw from Syria.""

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one who made the announcement about the US troops."
"Go ya ka polelo, ke naga efe e e rweleng maikarabelo a go disa batlhabani ba ba tshwerweng?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The text explicitly states: ""Turkey e tla tsaya maikarabelo a tlhokomelo ya batshwarwa ba batlhabani ba ISIS..."" (Turkey will take responsibility for the care of ISIS prisoners...).

Therefore, Turkey is the country taking responsibility for the captured fighters."
Ke eng se go dumelwang gore se bakile kgosomano?,"The correct answer is **B: Molelo o o sa laolegeng** (Uncontrolled fire).

The passage states: ""Thulano e diragetse kwa godimo mo dithabeng, go dumelwa go re e bakilwe ke molelo o o bogale."" This directly translates to ""An incident occurred in the mountains, believed to be caused by an uncontrolled fire.""
"
Kgosomano e diragetse mo karolong ya mofuta ofe?,"The correct answer is **D: Le le dithaba**.

The passage specifically states: ""Thulano e diragetse kwa godimo mo dithabeng..."" (The incident happened high in the mountains...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bobaba** - This doesn't align with the text.
*   **B: Makgwakgwa** - This doesn't align with the text.
*   **C: Mekgatlho e e itirileng seoposengwe** - This refers to opposing sides and isn’t describing the *location* of the incident.



"
Batlhankedi ba ne ba solofela eng ka ntlha ya morwalela?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsosoloswa ga dithotobolo tsa motlhaba** (The restoration of the reef).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...badiredi ba solofela go re a tla bo a lekane go tsosolosa moshawa o o gogotsweng kwa tlasenyana.""  This directly translates to ""...workers hope that it will be enough to restore the reef that was damaged below.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tlholwa ga lewatle** (Filling the lake) - The passage doesn't mention filling the lake.
* **C: Palo e e oketsegileng ya dihumpback chub** (An increased number of humpback chub) - The passage states humpback chub *declined*.
* **D: Diphologolo tse dintsi tsa naga** (More land animals) - The passage mentions animals *being trapped* by the receding water, not an increase in their numbers.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, tse di amilweng ke kago ya letamo, go ya go ile?","The correct answer is **B: Humpback chubs**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*go akarediwa humpback chub.*"" meaning the humpback chub was affected and is now extinct or endangered due to the dam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dithotobolo tsa motlhaba (Seabed structures):** The passage says building them *helped* animals, so they weren't negatively affected.
*   **C: Bonno ba diphologolo tsa naga (Land animal populations):** The passage mentions land animals were *helped* by the structures, not harmed.
*   **D: Go anama ga seretse (River sedimentation):** Sedimentation is the *cause* of the problem (the dam), not something that was *affected* by it.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a fileng Dinaga tse di Kopaneng, tshedimosetso ka tlhaselo e e ka nnang gone?","The correct answer is **C: Motswedi o o sa utololwang** (An unnamed source).

The passage states: ""U.S. ya re e amogetse tshedimosetso go tswa go **motswedi o o sa utololwang** o tlhalosa ka go tloba go dirisiwa ga baipolai ka bomo...""  This directly translates to ""U.S. says it received information from **an unnamed source** describing the use of terrorists...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bafeteletsa go tswa Somalia** - The passage says they are being *targeted* by those coming from Somalia, not that they provided the information.
*   **B: Boemedi ba Ethiopia** - Ethiopia is mentioned as a potential target, not the source of the information.
*   **D: Motswedi kwa Kenya** - While the U.S. office is *in* Kenya, the source of the information is not specified as being *from* Kenya."
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo,se go tweng ke leano la tlhaselo la bafeteletsa dilo?","The correct answer is **C: Phatlakanya dibomo kwa mafelong a konokono mo dinageng di le pedi**.

Here's why:

The text states the U.S. received intelligence about militants planning to attack ""vulnerable locations"" in *both* Ethiopia and Kenya. This means the plan involves attacks in two countries, specifically targeting ""vulnerable locations"" (mafelo a konokono).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Only mentions one country.
*   **B:** Doesn't specify *where* the attacks would be.
*   **D:** Doesn't mention vulnerable locations, and only specifies one country.



"
Ke ofe wa batho ba ba latelang yo e seng mmueledi?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   **Petros Mantouvalos** is explicitly stated to be a member of parliament (""leloko le la Palamente gape e le mmueledi"").
*   **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are identified as lawyers (""babueledi"").
*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a broadcaster (""mmegadikgang"") with a television show. The text does *not* state he is a representative or politician.



"
"Ke setlhopha sefe sa batho, se se sa umakiwang e le karolo ya matlhabisaditlhong mo teng ga setlhopha sa babueledi sa Bagerika?","The correct answer is **B: Baatlhodi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...matlhabisaditlhong mo setlhopha sa sa ithutetseng molao, se upoloditse ditiro tse di seng ka fa malaong tsa **baatlhodi**, babueledi, ba ba ithutetseng molao, le diagente ba di dirileng ngwaga tse di fetileng.""

This directly identifies *baatlhodi* (officials/leaders) as part of the group implicated in the illegal activities. The question asks which group is *not* identified as part of the *matlhabisaditlhong* (implicated group) within the Greek lawyers' group.  While lawyers (babueledi) *are* mentioned, they are listed as being *within* the implicated group, not as being separate from it.



"
India e latlhegetswe ke metabogo e le mekae?,"The correct answer is **A: 11**.

The text states: ""a betsa bone ga 11..."" which translates to ""lost 11 wickets"".  Therefore, India lost 11 wickets."
"Go ya ka temana,dintlha tse dintsi go feta tsa di- innings?","The correct answer is **B: Metabogo e le 36**

Here's why:

The text states: ""morago ga go latlhegelwa ke captain's wicket India ba dira di-run di le 36 fela, ba latlhegelwa ke di-wicket di le supa, go feleletse di-innings.""  This means India scored only 36 runs after losing their captain's wicket, and that finished their innings.  

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Metabogo e le 70** - This is Robin Uthappa's individual score, not the total runs in the innings after the captain's wicket.
*   **C: Metabogo e le 100** - This refers to a partnership between Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, not the innings score.
*   **D: Metabogo e le 41** - This is the score in the match, not necessarily relevant to the question about runs scored after the wicket."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng yone e bakang go kgobega marapo ga Adam Cuerden?","The correct answer is **C: Go sa reediwe ke Wales**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Cuerden *claims* Wales falsely accused him of re-editing things. This is presented as one of the reasons for his frustration and distress. The other options are directly stated as causes of his upset:

*   **A:** The passage mentions efforts to block sexually suggestive content, which contributed to the controversy.
*   **B:** Wales's accusation of deletion is explicitly mentioned.
*   **D:** Wales making jokes about the deletions is also stated as a problem.

The key is that Cuerden believes he *wasn't* re-editing things, so the *accusation* of re-editing is what bothers him, not the act itself."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se phimotsweng mo webosaeteng?","The correct answer is **A: Botaki**.

The text specifically states: ""...go phimolwa ga dilo dingwe fa a bua leba Wikinews..."" and later clarifies that the issue was ""...go phimolwa botaki ja gagwe."" (the deletion of his work).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go bontsha tlhakanelodikobo (Displaying pornography)** - The text mentions an attempt to write a policy *related* to sexual content, but doesn't say pornography was deleted.
*   **C: Kakangwa ya pholisi (Policy error)** - While a policy is discussed, the primary issue is the deletion of content.
*   **D: Bobegadikgang jwa sephiri (Privacy violation)** - The text doesn't mention any privacy concerns.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa tse di latelang tseo Amir Khan a sa di tshegetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Dikakanyo tsa basadi**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said, ""From my point of view I don’t think women should fight. That’s my opinion."" This clearly indicates he *doesn't* support the idea of women fighting (their ""opinions"" in this context).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tsenyelediwa bommamabole mo Diolimpiking (Including female boxers in the Olympics)** - The passage states he *eventually* supported British fighters at the 2012 Olympics, which included women's boxing.
*   **B: Bagaisani ba Borithane (British fighters)** - He explicitly supported British fighters.
*   **D: Lontone e tshwara Diolimpiki (London hosting the Olympics)** - He supported fighters *at* the London Olympics, implying support for the event itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e Amir Khan a e tshegetsang, go sa kgathalesege gore dikakanyo tsa gagwe ke eng?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his personal belief that women shouldn't fight, Amir Khan *did* support the British Olympians at the 2012 London Olympics. This is a direct statement of support within the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bommamabole ba basadi (Female boxers)** - He explicitly said he believed women shouldn't fight, which implies he wouldn't support female boxing.
*   **B: Bagaisani nae ba Diolimpiki tsa 2004 (His fellow Olympians in 2004)** - The passage doesn't mention any support for his fellow Olympians in 2004.
*   **D: Ba bangwe ba ba gapileng dimetlele tsa selefera (Other silver medalists)** - The passage doesn't indicate support for other silver medalists.



"
Peter Lenz o tlhokofetse neng?,"The correct answer is **B: Morago ga go wa mo baesekeleng ya gagwe** (After falling from his motorcycle).

The passage clearly states: ""O ile a wa mo sekuteng sa gagwe a bo a thulwa ke mokgweetsi..."" (He fell from his motorcycle and was hit by a driver...).  This directly answers the question of *when* Peter Lenz was injured.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka nako ya go tlolatlola, ba ithuthufatsa** (During the warm-up, they got excited) - This doesn't relate to *when* the injury happened.
*   **C: Kwa bookelong** (At the hospital) - He was taken to the hospital *after* being injured, not injured *at* the hospital.
*   **D: Fa a na le badiri ba kalafi mo tseleng ya tabogo ya mabelo** (When he had medical personnel on the track) - They assisted him *after* the fall, not during it.



"
Ke mang Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Mogaisani yo mongwe** (Another racer).

The passage states that Xavier Zayat was the racer who collided with Peter Lenz. While the medical staff helped Lenz, Zayat was the one *involved in the accident* with him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Badiri ba ditirelo tsa kalafi ba mo tselaneng ya kgaisano** (Medical personnel on the track) - They *helped* Lenz, but weren't involved in the crash.
*   **C: Ngaka** (Doctor) - While medical personnel were involved, the passage doesn't identify Zayat as a doctor.
*   **D: Motshegetsi wa metshameko** (Sports fan) - Zayat was a competitor, not a spectator.



"
"Ke mo seemong sefe, mo mopalami wa sefofane, yo o tshogileng,a ka nneng a sologelwa mosola ka go tlhaloganya bokafateng jwa sefofane?","The correct answer is **B: Fa go ila go fofa ga bone, go theilwe mo letshogong la tse di sa itseweng.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding the *mechanism* of flight to overcome fear.** It states that understanding *how* a plane works can help someone cope with the fear associated with feeling out of control, much like understanding what happens during turbulence.
* **Option B directly relates to this:**  ""Go ila go fofa ga bone, go theilwe mo letshogong la tse di sa itseweng"" translates to ""their fear of flying is rooted in the unknown mechanisms of the plane.""  Understanding those mechanisms (how the plane handles turbulence, for example) would be a way to address the fear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa mopalami a tlhabiswa ditlhong ke letshogo la gagwe** (If the pilot is overwhelmed by their own thoughts) - This is about the pilot's *internal* state, not understanding the plane itself.
* **C: Fa mopalami a sa itumedisiwe ke mefuta yotlhe ya dipalangwa** (If the pilot is dissatisfied with all types of aircraft) - This is about preference, not fear or understanding.
* **D: Fa letshogo la bone le tswa kwa ditiragalong tse di utlwisang botlhoko, tse di sa amaneng le go fofa** (If their fear stems from painful experiences unrelated to flying) - This suggests the fear is based on unrelated trauma, not the flying experience itself.  The passage focuses on fears *specifically* related to flight.

"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se mosepedi yo o nang le kitso ka ditlhwatlhwa, a tshwanetseng go se dira labofelo?","The correct answer is **C: Bapisa dituelo magareng ga ditheo tse dintsi tsa mesepele** (Compare prices among many airlines).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...go solegela molemo go bapisa dipholo tsa patlo le go leba webosaete ya ditirelo tsa sefofane ka boyone pele o dira peeletso."" This directly translates to ""It is beneficial to compare search results and carefully look at the airline's website before making a reservation.""  Comparing prices *is* the key thing a knowledgeable traveler should do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batla tse ditheo tsa mosepele tse dintsi di se kgothaletsang** (Look for many airlines that don't recommend it) - This doesn't make sense in the context of finding a good flight.
*   **B: Beeletsa ka tlhamalalo le ditirelo tsa diphofo** (Reserve directly with airlines) - While booking directly *can* be good, the passage emphasizes comparing *first*.
*   **D: Tlhola webosaete ya boemafofane** (Visit the aviation website) - The passage suggests looking at *airline* websites, not a general aviation website.



"
"Go ya ka temana, batsamai ba tshwanetse go dira eng pele go bona ditlhwatlhwa tse di gaisang tsotlhe, tsa go fofa?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhola webosaete ya boemafofane (Check the airline's website)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...go leba webosaete ya ditirelo tsa sefofane ka boyone pele o dira peeletso."" (…look at the airline's website carefully before making a reservation).  This directly advises travelers to check the website.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bapisa ditlhwatlhwa magareng ga mefuta ya ba ba dirang palogare (Compare fares between different carriers):** While the passage mentions fares can vary, it doesn't specifically say to *compare* them as a first step.
* **C: Beeletsa ka tlhamalalo kwa ditirelong tsa difofane (Book directly with the airline):**  The passage suggests checking *before* booking, not simply booking directly.
* **D: Beeletsa ka tlhamalalo le moemedi wa tsa Mesepele (Book directly with a travel agent):** The passage doesn't mention travel agents at all.



"
Ke neng fa molekane a tlhokang go pata tsamaiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa dilo di romelwa ka dipalangwa tsa dithoto tsa mo moweng** (When things are shipped through insured cargo routes).

Here's why:

The passage states the only way to ensure safe delivery was to ship items as insured goods. It also mentions regulations prevent shipping goods outside of a customs broker's supervision. This implies the partner needs to ""cover"" or manage the system when using this specific (and potentially problematic) method of shipping via cargo routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fa setheo se dirisa difofane tsa sone** (When the facility uses its own planes) - The passage states that using their own planes sometimes works well, sometimes doesn't, but doesn't suggest a need for the partner to intervene.
*   **C: Fa dilo di romelwa jaaka morwalo yo o kwadisitsweng** (When things are shipped as registered mail) - The passage doesn't discuss registered mail.
*   **D: Fa tsamaiso e tshwerwe ke setheo se segolo** (When the system is held by a large facility) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the size of the facility impacting the need for the partner's involvement.



"
"Go ya ka temana,fa o tlhopha tirelo ya difofane ya Frequent Flyer e e mo kgolaganong,ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tshwanetseng go nna ditlapele?","The correct answer is **C: Tirelo ya difofane e o e palamang gantsi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...o tshwanetse o ele tlhoko gore ditshiamelo tse di neelwang gantsi ga di tshwane e bile dituelo tse ba go fang tsone di ka tswa di tlhatswapelo ka fa tlase ga difofane tsa dikgolagano tse dingwe.""  This means the focus should be on the airlines you *frequently* fly because the benefits and costs can vary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boemafofane jo bo neelang dintha tse dintsi go gaisa:** The passage doesn't emphasize simply finding airlines with the most rewards; it emphasizes comparing across airlines.
*   **B: Tirelo ya difofane mo kgolaganong e kgolo go di gaisa:** The size of the airline isn't a key factor.
*   **D: Tirelo ya difofane e e ka bong e tsenya ditshiamelo tse di oketsegileng:** While extra benefits are good, the core message is about consistently evaluating *your* usual airlines.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang a ka neelang dintlha tse dintsi tsa frequent flyer?","The correct answer is **B: Tirelo ya difofane, e o e dirisang gantsi go gaisa, mo kgolaganong e e tshwanang.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...o tshwanetse o ele tlhoko gore ditshiamelo tse di neelwang gantsi ga di tshwane e bile dituelo tse ba go fang tsone di ka tswa di tlhatswapelo ka fa tlase ga difofane tsa dikgolagano tse dingwe.""  This translates to ""...you need to be aware that the rewards offered frequently are not the same and the points they give you can often be less than those of other airlines.""

This implies that airlines you fly *often* within the *same* alliance (kgolagano e e tshwanang) will likely offer the best frequent flyer points.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't suggest *any* airline will necessarily give a lot of points, just that consistent airlines are better.
*   **C:**  The passage contrasts rewards *between* airlines, not just differences in general.
*   **D:**  The passage emphasizes flying *frequently* with a specific airline, not just any airline in the same alliance.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditemosi tse di latelang, tse di ka kgorelediwang ke go nwa nnotagi thata?","The correct answer is **B: Pono**.

Here's why:

The passage states that long-term consequences of drinking counterfeit alcohol can include **blindness** (go senyega ga sebete le e leng bofofu). This directly relates to vision (pono).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutlo (Hearing):** The passage doesn't mention any effects on hearing.
*   **C: Tatso (Taste):** The passage doesn't mention any effects on taste.
*   **D: Monko (Smell):** The passage doesn't mention any effects on smell.



"
"Jaaka go tlhalositswe mo temaneng, ke eng se se kgonang go fokotsa ditlamorago tse di kotsi tsa bojalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Go nwa bojalwa ka tekanyetso** (Drinking alcohol in moderation).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Bojalwa bo ama mongwe le mongwe ka tsela tse di sa tshwaneng, go itse selekanyo sa gago go botlhokwa."" (Alcohol affects everyone differently, knowing your limit is important.)  This directly links moderation to reducing harmful effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nwa nnotagi le methanol** (Drinking alcohol and methanol) - Methanol is *dangerous* and can cause blindness or death, as the passage warns.
* **B: Go nwa bojalwa jo bo dirwang ka tsela e e sa letlelesegang** (Drinking illegally made alcohol) - The passage states this *increases* risk due to harmful chemicals.
* **D: Go nwa le batho ba bangwe** (Drinking with others) - The passage doesn't mention this as a factor in reducing risk.



"
Ke kae moo tlhwatlhwa ya ditsha e leng magareng ga tse di kwa godimo go gaisa mo Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Kgaolo ya Canal**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...ditlhwatlhwa tsa ditsha teng ke dingwe tsa tse di kwa godimo ga gaisa mo nageng"" referring to *teng* – which is the Canal District (Kgaolo ya Canal).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mo lefelong lengwe le lengwe le le beetsweng thoko go nna Lefelo la Ngwao la Lefatshe la UNESCO** - While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, this is too broad. The text pinpoints the high-altitude lock specifically to the Canal District.
*   **C: Mafelo a a ntshitsweng mo Binnenstad** - The Canal District is *within* Binnenstad, but the text focuses on the Canal District itself.
*   **D: Mafelo a boleng jwa setso** - Again, too broad. Many places of cultural value exist, but the text directly connects the high-altitude locks to the Canal District.



"
Goreng Kgaolo ya Canal e beetswe thoko go nna Lefelo la Ngwao la Lefatshe la UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: Boleng ba kwa re tswang le setso**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the Canal District was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site ""ka ntlha ya setso se se kgethegileng le boleng jwa ditso"" – which translates to ""because of its unique culture and the value of its history.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dilo tsa yone tse di tlhomologileng:** While the area is famous, the text doesn't say it was designated for its fame.
* **C: Lefelo la yone, le le dikologileng Binnenstad:** Its location is *a* factor, but not the primary reason for UNESCO status.
* **D: Setsha sa yone se se tlhwatllhwa godimo:** High rents are a result of its popularity, not the reason for UNESCO designation.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e dirang gore go etela Phnom Krom go go tswele molemo?","The correct answer is **D: Leeto la sekepe go ya kwa lekadibeng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mosepele wa go etela lefelo le o kgona go kopannwa fela le leoto la sekepe go ya kwa lekadibeng."" This means a boat trip to the countryside is the unique way to access Phnom Krom, making it a benefit of visiting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Se o se bonang fa o le godimo ga Tonle Sap** - While the temple overlooks Tonle Sap, the view itself isn't presented as a *benefit* of visiting.
*   **B: Go tsamaya go ralala Angkor Pass** - The passage states you *need* an Angkor Pass, not that it's easy to use it.
*   **C: Go bona Siem Reap** - Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, but the passage doesn't focus on seeing Siem Reap as a benefit.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se tlhokegang gore baeng ba tsene kwa Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Go bona Angkor Pass**.

The passage states: ""Teseletso ya Angkor Pass e a tlhokafala fa o batla go tsena mo tempeleng e, ka jalo, netefatsa go re ga o a tlogela teseletso ya ga go ya mesepele fa o ya ko Tonle Sap."" This directly translates to: ""An Angkor Pass is required if you want to enter the temple, so, make sure you don't forget the pass when you go to Tonle Sap.""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e neng e ka thibela mojanala gore a se etele Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhwatlhwa godimo ya maeto a bojanala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maeto a bojanala a tlhwatlhwa godimo, a tlhoka boitekanelo mo mmeleng..."" (Travel to Antarctica is dangerous due to high altitudes, lack of oxygen, and...)  This directly identifies high altitude as a challenge and potential deterrent for travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kgatlhego e le yosi, ya go tlhotlhomisa Lewatle la Ross:** The passage mentions the Ross Sea, but not in the context of being a deterrent.
*   **C: Lenaneo la tiro le le kgontshang mosepele ka Sedimonthole le Ferikgong:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Tsamaiso ya mmele e e lekanyeditsweng:** The passage actually states that travel *requires* a robust physical condition (""...a tlhoka boitekanelo mo mmeleng""), not a well-adjusted one, implying a lack of physical ability could prevent a trip.



"
Mojanala yo o kgatlhegelang go palama dithaba a ka nne a etela karolo efe ya Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Lefelo le mo gare ga lefatshe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go a tle go nne le maeto a bojanala a difofane a a tsenelelang mo bogareng, go ya go palama dithaba kgotsa go goroga ko South Pole..."" This directly links mountain climbing expeditions to the *interior* of Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lewatle la Ross:** The passage mentions the Ross Sea, but not in relation to mountain climbing.
*   **C: Peninsula:** The passage mentions the peninsula as a destination, but not for mountain climbing.
*   **D: Ditlhaketlhake:** While mentioned, the passage doesn't connect these to mountain climbing specifically.



"
Ke kae moo lefelo la tshekatsheko ya loapi le dinaledi la pele le ka se nne gone thata?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwa lefelong le le kgakala**.

Here's why:

The passage states that modern telescopes are often built in **remote areas** with **stable atmospheric conditions**.  The first observatories, lacking the technology to overcome light pollution, were left behind as cities grew. This implies they were *not* in remote areas initially, and that remote areas are now preferred for observation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mo lefelong le le fitlhelelwang motlhofo (In a easily accessible area):** The passage implies the opposite - they were abandoned *because* of increased accessibility (and therefore light pollution).
*   **B: Mo bogareng ba toropo (In the middle of the city):**  The passage directly states that light pollution makes cities unsuitable for observation.
*   **D: Mo lefelong la bonno la mo kholetšhe (In a quiet place in the countryside):** While countryside is better than a city, the passage specifically emphasizes the need for *remote* areas with *stable atmospheric conditions* - which isn't necessarily guaranteed by just being in the countryside.  ""Kgakala"" (remote) is the stronger and more accurate descriptor from the text.



"
Thelesekhoupu ya patlisiso ya segompieno e ka bewa kae?,"The correct answer is **D: Mo kagong e kgolo** (In a remote area).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bontsi di-telescope tsa dipatlisiso tsa segompieno ke dikago tse di boitshegang mo mafelong a a kgakala a a nang le maemo a atemosefiere a a nametsang."" This translates to: ""Many modern research telescopes are located in remote areas with stable atmospheric conditions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Motlobo wa setso** (Cultural site) - While old observatories *might* be at cultural sites, modern research telescopes are not primarily placed there.
*   **B: Mo lefelong la bonno la yunibesithi** (In a university town) - Universities often *use* telescopes, but the research telescopes themselves are usually located away from cities.
*   **C: Kwa mafelong a thuto** (In educational areas) - Similar to B, these are places where telescope observations are *studied*, not where the telescopes are *located* for optimal performance.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe le le ka tshwanelang go gaisa, letsatsi la go itheetsa kwa lotshitshing la lewatle?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Matshitshi a Tamaki Drive a mo Boemakepeng jwa Waitemata, mo mafelong a bahumi a **Mission Bay** le St Heliers kwa Central Auckland. Ka dinako tse dingwe matshitshi ano a a bo a tletse ka malapa ka mabenkele a a farologaneng a a mo letshitshing. Go thuma koo go babalesegile.""

This indicates that both Mission Bay and St Heliers are suitable for a day at the beach, with the text specifically mentioning families and shops being present, making it a good place to spend the day. However, the phrasing suggests that Mission Bay is presented first and more prominently as a popular spot.



"
"Go ya ka temana,maemo a go thuma, a ka nna a babalesega go feta kae?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Auckland e ikadile mo maemelong a dikepe a le mabedi. A a tumileng go gaisa a one a mo mafelong a le mararo."" and later says ""...a ikadile go tswa kwa Long Bay kwa bokone go ya Devonport kwa borwa."" and ""Otlhe fela a batla e le mabopo a a nang le motlhaba e bile go babalesegile go thuma mo go one..."" This clearly indicates Devonport is a good, safe place to anchor/moor a boat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bokone jwa Kgaolo ya Boemakepe:** This is a general area, not a specific, easy-to-anchor location mentioned as particularly suitable.
*   **C: Bogare ba Auckland:** Too broad - the text focuses on specific coastal areas.
*   **D: Long Bay:** The text mentions starting *from* Long Bay, not that it's a particularly good place to anchor.



"
"Fa o etela lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka tsewang e sa tshwanela?","The correct answer is **C: Go dira metlae**.

Here's why:

The prompt *specifically* states: ""Le seke la dira metlae ka Holocaust kana DI-Nazi."" (Do not make comparisons to the Holocaust or Nazis).  This makes making comparisons (or ""metlae"") explicitly unacceptable behavior when visiting this place.

Let's look at why the other options are less problematic (though still potentially disrespectful and should be avoided if possible):

*   **A: Diragatsa maikano (Express opinions):** While potentially sensitive, expressing thoughts isn't *inherently* disrespectful, as long as it's done thoughtfully.
*   **B: Go tlogela matshwao gongwe mo lefelong (Leaving marks somewhere in the area):** This is generally disrespectful, but not explicitly forbidden in the text as strongly as making comparisons.
*   **D: Go kgwarinya motako (Shouting/making noise):** Again, disrespectful, but not as directly prohibited as the comparisons.



Therefore, **C** is the most directly prohibited action according to the text."
Ke efe ya tseno e e tlhalosang dipuo tsa lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **D: Tse di tshelang** (Those that are living).

Here's why:

The passage states that lingua francas are ""dipuo tse di tshelang"" (living languages) that have become dominant ""ka ntlha ya lebaka le le rileng kgotsa le sele"" (for a broad or specific reason) to facilitate communication between people who speak other languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsa maitirelo** (Artificial) - The passage specifically contrasts artificial/constructed languages with lingua francas.
* **B: Tse e seng tsa tlholego** (Non-natural) - While lingua francas might not be *everyone's* native language, they are naturally evolved languages.
* **C: Itlhametswe** (Invented) - Similar to A, this refers to constructed languages, not lingua francas.



"
Ke polelo efe e e sa tlhaloseng dipuo tse di thusang ka nepagalo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ke dipuo tse di itlhametsweng, tse e leng tsone tse di eteletseng pele magareng ga batho ba ba buang dipuo tse di farologaneng.**

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts *auxiliary languages* (dipuo tse di thusang) with *lingua francas*.**  A key characteristic of a lingua franca, as the passage states, is that it's a *natural* or *living* language that has become prominent *specifically to facilitate communication* between speakers of other languages.  Option D describes this role - being a leading language *between speakers of different languages*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This describes a *lingua franca*, not an auxiliary language.
* **B:** This correctly identifies auxiliary languages but doesn't address what's *wrong* with them in comparison to lingua francas.
* **C:** This restates part of the passage's definition of auxiliary languages, but again, it doesn't point to the flaw identified in the text (they are less effective than lingua francas).



"
"Go ya ka temana,mopagami o tshwanetse a lebe eng fa leeto la bone la sekepe le le ka mariga?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhokego tsa Visa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bapagami ba sekepe ga ba tlhoke go nna le visa (leba melawana)."" This directly points to visa requirements being a key thing a traveler needs to be aware of when taking a cruise. While the text mentions other things, it *highlights* the visa situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwa ntlwana e leng teng** - The text mentions the ""ntlwana"" (mosquito) but doesn't frame it as a crucial thing to prepare for.
*   **C: Melawana** -  While ""melawana"" (rules) are mentioned in relation to the visa, the *requirement* of a visa is the more important thing.
*   **D: Nako e e feditsweng mo toropong** - The text notes time spent in the city, but doesn't say a traveler *needs* to be aware of it.



"
"Go ya ka temana,fa leeto la sekepe la mopalami le le selemo, ke eng seo a ka kgonang go se efoga","The correct answer is **C: Ditlhokego tsa Visa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Bapagami ba sekepe ga ba tlhoke go nna le visa (leba melawana)."" This directly addresses visa requirements.  A tourist on a year-long cruise might be concerned about whether they need a visa for the stops along the Baltic Sea, and the passage provides information relevant to that concern.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Nako kwa toropong** - While the passage mentions time in St. Petersburg, it doesn't suggest this is something to be worried about.
*   **B: Go tsamaya mo dikgapetleng** - The passage doesn't mention anything about difficulties in traveling to the destinations.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg** - Simply stating the city isn't a source of worry a tourist would have."
Goreng Secatalan se dirisiwa kgapetsakgapetsa mo matshwaong le dikitsisong mo Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **C: Batho ba ikgethela leleme leo kwa Barcelona**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Selekano se se ka nnang sephatlo sa batho, se ikgethela go bua se-Catalan..."" This directly indicates that Catalan is the preferred language of many residents of Barcelona.  This preference is then reflected in the use of Catalan on signage and announcements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Se tlhaloganngwa ka bontsi go feta se-Spanich:** The passage says many people *understand* Spanish, but doesn't say Catalan is more *understood*.
* **B: E ne e le leleme la semmuso la ntlha la toropo:** While Catalan is an official language, the passage doesn't state it was the *first* official language.
* **D: Mo Metro le mafelo a mangwe a bosetšhaba, go tla bontsi jwa baagi ba ba buang Secatalan:** The passage doesn't explicitly state that *more* people speak Catalan. It says there's a strong preference for it.



"
Ke efe ya diteme tse di latelang e e diriswang ke tsamaiso ya Metro ya kwa Barcelona go dira dikitsiso tsa ka metlha?,"The correct answer is **B: Secatalan**.

The passage states, ""dikitsiso mo Metro di dirwa fela ka se-Catalan."" This directly answers the question. While announcements are made in multiple languages for irregularities, *regular* announcements are only in Catalan."
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditlamelo tse di latelang e e ka se tseelweng kwa godimo ke bed and breakfast ya maemo a a kwa godimo?","The correct answer is **D: Wi-Fi e e bonako (Reliable Wi-Fi)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the luxuries of high-end B&Bs: high-quality bedding, gourmet food, beautiful gardens, and historic buildings. It *doesn't* mention Wi-Fi at all. Options A, B, and C are all explicitly listed as features of a top-tier B&B. Therefore, reliable Wi-Fi is the only option *not* mentioned and is the one least likely to be a defining feature of a luxury B&B as described in the text.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e seng nngwe ya dintlhakgolo tsa kgaisano magareng ga di B&B tsa maemo a a kwa godimo?","The correct answer is **D: Dijo le dino tse di bonwang mo lefelong**.

Here's why:

The passage states that high-end B&Bs differentiate themselves primarily through **the quality of accommodation and locally sourced food**. Options A and B directly relate to these differentiators (custom-made quilts = quality accommodation, and elaborate breakfasts = locally sourced food). Option C, ""high prices"" is mentioned as a characteristic of these B&Bs. 

However, ""dijo le dino tse di bonwang mo lefelong"" (food and sights seen in the area) is a *general* descriptor of a travel experience and isn't specifically mentioned as a point of competition or differentiation *between* B&Bs in the passage.  While a good B&B might be *near* interesting sights and offer good food, that's not what sets the *high-end* ones apart.
"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse di ka se tshwarelweng kwa Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Ditiragalo tsa go relela mo serameng kwa Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The text states that skiing events will be held in Taizicheng, which is 220km away from Beijing.  The other options are all specifically mentioned as being held *in Beijing*:

*   **A: Mekete ya pulo** - The text states the opening and closing ceremonies will be in Beijing.
*   **C: Mokete wa go tswalelwa ga metshameko** - The text states the opening ceremony will be in Beijing.
*   **D: Indoor ice events** - The text specifically mentions ""Indoor Ice Events"" will be held in Beijing.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e tla tshwarwang ke Beijing ka 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Diolimpiki tsa mariga**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Toropokgolo ya China, Beijing e tla tshegetsa metshameko ya Olympics Winter Games ka 2022.""  ""Winter Games"" means the Winter Olympics, or ""Diolimpiki tsa mariga"" in Setswana.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Metshameko ya Olympics ya selemo** - The text refers to *Winter* Olympics, not year-round Olympics.
*   **B: Ditiragalo tsa go relela mo serameng di tshwarelwa mo teng ga lefelo** - Skiing events are held in Zhangjiakou, not Beijing.
*   **D: Mekete ya go tswalelwa ga metshameko** - While a ceremony is mentioned, the main event is the Olympics themselves, not just the ceremony.



"
Ke mang a leng kotsing thata ya go tshwaediwa ke mohikelo wa dinonyane?,"The correct answer is **C: Batho ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi** (People who raise poultry and pigs).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Gantsi go amega batho ba ba berekang le dikoko le dipidipidi, mme fela le balebeledi ba dinonyane le bone ga ba a sireletsega.""  This translates to: ""It usually affects people who raise poultry and pigs, and even bird watchers are not safe.""

While bird watchers (option A) *are* mentioned as being at risk, the text emphasizes that those raising poultry and pigs are *usually* affected, making them the group most at risk.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, tse di tlhalosang ka nepagalo,mohikela wa dinonyane?","The correct answer is **C: Balebeledi ba dinonyane ba mo kotsing ya go tshwaediwa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""...mme fela le balebeledi ba dinonyane le bone ga ba a sireletsega."" (and even poultry farmers are not safe). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says people *generally* infected are those handling poultry, but it doesn't say they are the *only* ones.
*   **B:** The passage states fewer than 1,000 cases have been confirmed in humans, while implying the virus affects birds and other animals. This means more cases are in animals than humans.
*   **D:** The passage mentions some cases were severe, but does not state that *all* cases were fatal.



"
White Sea–Baltic Canal e golanyanya eng?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic Ocean le Baltic Sea**.

The passage explicitly states: ""White Sea–Baltic Canal e golaganya Arctic ocean le Baltic Sea, e heta ka Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga le Saint Petersburg, thata ka dinoka le macha.""

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Go ya ka temana, makwalo a mesepele a ka latiwa ka mofuta ofe wa sepalangwa go itsa go kgaupetsa mopagami?","The correct answer is **B: Diterena tsa bosigo**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Mo ditereneng tsa bosigo, dibukana tsa mesepele di ka tsewa ke babereki ba terena go itsa go kgaupetsa bapalami boroko.""  This directly links the use of inspection documents to night trains for security purposes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Difofane** - The text mentions airplanes only in the very beginning as an example of transportation, but doesn't link them to inspection documents.
*   **C: Dikepe** -  Similar to airplanes, ships are just mentioned as a type of transport.
*   **D: Diterena tse di kgabaganyang melelwane** - While the text mentions inspection on these trains, it doesn't say documents are *used to deter theft* on them. It just states inspections happen while the train is moving.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke neng mo bukana ya gago ya boitshupo e ka tlhatlhobiwang teng mo ditereneng dingwe tse di kgabaganyang melelwane?","The correct answer is **D: Terene e ntse e tsamaya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mo ditereneng dingwe tse di kgabaganyang melelwane ditlhatlhobo di dirwa mo tereneng e ntse e tsamaya mme o tshwanetse wa nna le boitshupo jo bo siameng mo go wena fa o palama nngwe ya diterena tseo."" This directly translates to ""On some long-distance trains, checks are done while the train is moving and you must have valid identification with you when riding one of those trains.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Morago ga go fologa terena** (After passing the train) - The text doesn't mention checks happening *after* the train passes.
*   **B: Fa o robetse** (When you are sleeping) - While the text mentions night trains, it doesn't say identification is checked while you're asleep.
*   **C: G a e tlhatlhobiwe** (It is not checked) - This is the opposite of what the text says.



"
"Ke efe ya dikgang tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya tlhagelela thata fa o nna kwa lefelong le le gaufi thata le mola wa equator kwa Singapore?","The correct answer is **C: Go felelwa ke maatla ka ntlha ya mogote**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that being close to the equator in Singapore means you need to ""mekamekana le diemo tsa mogote (wa sennela ruri)"" - meaning you need to adapt to the humidity. High humidity can be very draining and lead to feeling weak or fatigued (""go felelwa ke maatla"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go thukuthiwa (To be cold):** The equator is hot, not cold.
* **B: Go sa nne le phitlhelelo ya mabenkele (Lack of shops):** The passage explicitly says you can buy everything you need upon arrival (""o kgona go reka sengwe le sengwe teng fa o sena go goroga"").
* **D: Go timela (To be scared):**  The passage describes environmental conditions, not a feeling of fear.



"
Ke mang a ka batlang go sa je marotho a Sejeremane?,"The correct answer is **A: Mongwe yo mmele wa gagwe o ganwang ke manoko ka tsela e e masisi** (Someone whose body reacts badly to nuts).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. If someone has a serious nut allergy, they would *need* to avoid German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mongwe yo o ratang diphuding tse di nontshang go feta tse dingwe** (Someone who prefers creamy desserts to others): The passage describes pastries, which aren't necessarily creamy.
*   **C: Mongwe yo o sa rateng tšhokolete** (Someone who doesn't like chocolate): The passage doesn't mention chocolate.
*   **D: Mongwe yo o ratang tatso e e botshe thata go na le tatso ya letswai** (Someone who prefers a stronger flavour than a sweet flavour): The passage describes pastries as sweet (especially apple and cherry/plum varieties) and often paired with coffee, implying a preference for sweeter tastes.



"
Ke sediriswa sefe se se se kaiwang jaaka karolo ya paka e e rileng ya di-pastry tsa Majeremane?,"The correct answer is **C: Di-plums**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...fa tsa maungo a cherry le **plum** di bonala ka paka ya selemo."" ( ""...cherry and **plum** pastries appear in season."")

The other options are mentioned as ingredients *in* pastries, but plums are specifically linked to being available *during a specific season* (paka ya selemo - in season).



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse e ka nnang ntlha ya kakantsho ka “traveling on a budget”?","The correct answer is **B: Ikemisetse go latlhegelwa ke manobonobo**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that people willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and privileges are those who practice ""minimum budget travel.""  The phrase ""Ba ba ikemiseditseng go latlhegelwa ke manobononobo"" translates to ""Those who are willing to be deprived of comfort.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go theogela o ntse o le mo loetong (Staying in a hostel):** This is *an example* of a budget travel tactic, but not the core principle or a point of contention.
* **C: Kopa batho madi (Begging people for money):** The passage lists begging as an *extreme* consequence *of* very low-budget travel, not the travel style itself. It's presented as a negative outcome.
* **D: Fokotsa ditshenyegelo jaaka dijo le bonno (Reducing expenses like food and accommodation):**  Similar to A, this is a *method* of budget travel, not the fundamental mindset.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o ka kgaratlhelang go tsamaya ka madi a a lekanetseng?","The correct answer is **C: Mongwe yo o rulaganyang go dira a le kgakala fa a ntse a le mo loetong** (Someone who is willing to do odd jobs while traveling).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""minimum budget travel"" involves things like ""go theogela o ntse o le mo loetong"" (doing odd jobs while traveling), ""go kopa"" (begging), and even potentially illegal activities to fund the trip.  This demonstrates a willingness to live unconventionally and work for survival *during* the trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mongwe yo o amogelang kgwetlho** (Someone who accepts punishment) - While hardship is *implied* in budget travel, the passage doesn't say travelers *seek* punishment.
* **B: Mongwe yo o nang le nako e ntsi** (Someone who has a lot of time) - Time is a factor, but the passage focuses on the *financial* aspect and the lengths people go to to save money.
* **D: Mongwe yo o itumelelang go latela thulaganyo ya loeto** (Someone who enjoys following a travel plan) - Budget travel described in the passage is the *opposite* of meticulously planned; it's often spontaneous and reliant on finding ways to survive as you go.

"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka go nepagala,go kgweetsa magareng ga Point Marion le Fairmont?","The correct answer is **C: Selekanyo se se supilweng sa lobelo ga se gantsi se latelwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Selekanyo se se supilweng sa lobelo se lemotshega fa sele ko tlase mo dikarolong tse di fetileng le tse di latelang, — ka tlwaelo ke 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), — mme go obamela molao wa tsone o o gagametseng go botlhokwa le e leng go feta go na le go se dire jalo."" This directly warns drivers to *follow* the speed limit, implying it's easy to go over and potentially *not* followed by others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go na le ditsela tse di telele tsa mafelo a a kwa kgakala** - The passage describes the road as winding and having sharp curves, not long stretches.
*   **B: Ditselana di a tlhaela** - The passage mentions ""ditselana tse di tshesane"" (narrow lanes) which confirms this point.
*   **D: Tirelo ya mogala wa letheka ga e a tshwanela go nna e bothata** - The passage says the cell service is *surprisingly* good compared to other areas, meaning it *is* sufficient and not a problem.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tseno se bakgweetsi ba tshwanetseng ba tshwenyege thata ka sone fa ba kgweetsa mo tselafefong ya Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **D: Go kopana le ditiro tsa ditsela kgapetsakgapetsa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions the need for caution due to ""meandering roads, narrow lanes, and steep hills."" These all describe challenging road conditions or ""ditiro tsa ditsela."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tshwarwa ke pharakano e e kitlaneng** - The text doesn't mention traffic congestion.
*   **B: Go tlhoka tirelo e e lekaneng ya mogala** - While it notes cell service is *surprisingly* limited, it doesn't say it's a major concern for drivers.
*   **C: Go retologa ka bonako mo tseleng e e motsopodia** - The passage *warns* about steep hills, implying driving carefully is important, but it doesn't state it’s a common occurrence that drivers should expect."
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa tlhokegeng go simolola motshameko wa go dirisa seketswana?","The correct answer is **D: Go itshidila mmele go le gonnye**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that canyoneering *doesn't require a high level of physical fitness* (compared to activities like rock climbing, scuba diving, or alpine skiing). The other options – the ability to abseil (thuma), a good level of physical condition, and the ability to swim – are all mentioned as *part* of canyoneering.  Therefore, a *lack* of high physical fitness is the one thing not needed to start.



"
"Ke dife tsa tseno, tse di ka tlhokegang mo loetong lo lo khutswane lwa canyoning?","The correct answer is **A: Bokgoni ba go itshidila mmele jo bo mo maemong a a kwa godimo (High level of physical fitness)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mo go sa tlhokeng go itshidila mmele go go ipaakanyetsa (fa go tshwantshanngwa le go palama matlapa, scuba diving kgotsa alpine skiing).""  This translates to ""...requiring physical fitness to prepare (compared to rock climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boitemogelo jwa pele ka scuba diving (Previous experience with scuba diving):** The passage *contrasts* canyoneering with scuba diving, implying it doesn't require prior scuba diving experience.
* **C: Go nna le setifikeiti sa canyoneering (Having a canyoneering certificate):** While a certificate might be *helpful* or *required by some operators*, the passage doesn't mention it as a basic necessity.
* **D: Bokgoni ba go thuma (Ability to abseil):** The passage mentions abseiling as *one* activity within canyoneering, but doesn't say it's the only prerequisite.  Physical fitness is more fundamental.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo se ka thusang fa motho a rulaganyetsa go kampa mo koloing ya gagwe?","The correct answer is **B: Koloi e e nang le ditilo tse o kgonang go di robatsa** (A car with seats you can lay down).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""O ka kampa mo koloing fa o na le bene e tona, koloi ya modiro wa SUV, sedan kgotsa Station Wagon e e nang le ditilo tse o kgonang go di robatsa."" (You can camp in a car if you have a van, SUV, sedan or Station Wagon with seats you can lay down).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O itse makoa a koloi ya gago** (You know the flaws of your car) - While knowing your car is helpful, the passage says it's important for *appreciating* your car when comparing it to others, not specifically for car camping.
*   **C: Tente** (Tent) - The passage mentions setting up a tent, but says car camping is an alternative *to* setting up a tent.
*   **D: Go tlhoma tente mo lelwapeng la mong** (Setting up a tent on someone's property) - The passage mentions this as something that *can* get you work, but isn't related to car camping itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo ba ba kampelang mo koloing ba ka batlang go se efoga gore ba se bonagale?","The correct answer is **A: Fa o na le koloi e tona, ya modiro wa SUV kgotsa bene e nnye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O ka kampa mo koloing fa o na le bene e tona, koloi ya modiro wa SUV, sedan kgotsa Station Wagon e e nang le ditilo tse o kgonang go di robatsa."" This directly indicates the *type of vehicle* you need to be able to camp in your car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go tsaya loeto lo loleele la tsela** - While the passage mentions long road trips, it doesn't say this is what you need to avoid being noticed while car camping.
*   **C: Go tlhoma tente mo toropong kgotsa mo lelwapeng la mong** - This refers to traditional camping, not car camping.
*   **D: Go sa tlwaele dikoloi tse ba di dirisang** - The passage suggests you *should* be familiar with your car.



"
"Go ya ka temana, Ke mang yo o agileng Casablanca seša lokgetlho lwa bobedi?","The correct answer is **D: Kgosikgolo ya Morocco**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kgosikgolo wa Morocco o ne a e aga gape toropo e, a e bitsa Daru I-Badya..."" This directly answers the question of who rebuilt the city after it was abandoned by the Portuguese.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapotokisi:** The text says the Portuguese *abandoned* the city after an earthquake, they didn't rebuild it.
*   **B: Bagwebi ba Spain:** The text says Spanish traders *named* the city Casablanca, but didn't rebuild it.
*   **C: Bamereniti:** The text mentions the Phoenicians and Romans used it as a trading post, but doesn't say they rebuilt it."
Ke mang yo a ikgatolositseng toropo ya gompieno ya Casablanca morago ga masetlapelo a tlholego,"The correct answer is **B: Mapotokisi**.

The text states: ""Ma-Potokisi ba ile ba di thuba mme ba di aga sesha ka leina la Casa Branca, mme morago ga moo ba di ikgatolosa morago ga thoromo ya lefatshe ya ngwaga wa 1755."" 

This directly translates to: ""The Portuguese captured it and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, and later abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.""
"
"Go ya ka temana,Sintra e ne ya tumisiwa ke eng magareng ga batswantle?","The correct answer is **C: Pego e ntle, e e begilweng ke Lord Byron**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...e e neng ya tumisiwa ke batswantle morago ga pego e ntle ya bontle jwa yone e e begilweng ke Lord Byron.""  This directly translates to ""...which was made famous by poets after a beautiful poem of its beauty was written by Lord Byron.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca** - Cabo da Roca is a location the bus stops at, not what made Sintra famous.
*   **B: Modimo o o itsegeng Marian** - This refers to Fatima, a different location mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Hisitori ya marato** - While described as a ""town of love,"" the text doesn't say this *caused* its fame among poets.



"
Ke eng se se tsa tseweng tsia ke Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Lefatshe le lešwa** (The new state).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""go ne ga tlhangwa lefatshe le lesha, mme fela fela ga se lefatshe le letseewang tsiya ke mafatshe a mangwe le la Armenia tota."" This directly translates to: ""a new state was formed, but it was not recognized by other countries or Armenia itself.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kgaolo ya Nagorno-Karabakh** (The Nagorno-Karabakh region) - Armenia *supported* the region, but didn't claim it as something *they* created.
* **B: Ntwa kgatlhanong le batho ba letso la se-Azeri** (War against the Azeri people) - They participated in a war *supporting* the region, not that the war itself is what they created.
* **C: Dingangisano tsa sepolotiki ka Azerbaijan** (Political disputes with Azerbaijan) - These were a *result* of the situation, not something Armenia *created*.



"
Ke eng se se tsweletseng go goga- goga mo seretseng dikamano tsa magareng ga Azerbaijan le Armenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Dingangisano tsa sepolotiki**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Dingangisano tsa sepolitiki kaga kgaolo di tsweletse ka go goga goga mo seretseng dikamano tsa magareng ga Armenia le Azerbaijan."" (Political disputes regarding the region led to strained relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batho ba letso la Armenia mo lefatsheng la Azerbaijan:** While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is part of the *cause* of the conflict, it's the *disputes* about that presence that strain relations.
*   **B: Ntwa ya 1994:** The war was a result of the disputes and a *part* of the story, but the disputes themselves are what continue to cause tension.
*   **D: Kgaolo ya Nagorno-Karabakh:** Similar to option A, the region is the focal point of the conflict, but it’s the political disagreements *over* the region that cause the strained relations.



"
"Fa o pagama tekesi kwa Charlotte, ke eng se se ka dirang gore go nne le tuelo ya tlaleletso?","The correct answer is **C: Go ya Uptown**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ga se ga ntsi ba malapa a Charlotte ba dirisa ditekisi, le fa gone di le mosola mo mabakeng a a rileng. Go na le tuelo ya tlaleletso fa bapagami ba feta 2, ka jalo jaana go tura go feta selekanyo.""  This directly links the toll to going to Uptown Charlotte because that's where more than 2 passengers are likely to be.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go nna kwa lefelong le lengwe** - The passage doesn't mention anything about location affecting the toll.
* **B: Go nna le bapagami ba le bararo** - While the toll is triggered by more than 2 passengers, the passage doesn't say *having* 3 passengers causes the toll, it says the toll exists *because* more than 2 are going to Uptown.
* **D: Kwa ba lelwapa botlhe ba ka ijesang monate** - This is a general statement about Charlotte, not a reason for the toll.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka kaiwang e le se se sa itumediseng ka go nna kwa Charlotte le bana?","The correct answer is **B: Go drisa tekisi** (Taking taxis).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ga se ga ntsi ba malapa a Charlotte ba dirisa ditekisi, le fa gone di le mosola mo mabakeng a a rileng.""  This translates to ""Not many families in Charlotte use taxis, even though they are plentiful in the busy areas."" This implies that taxis are expensive or inconvenient for families, making it a potential drawback of living in Charlotte with children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhwatlhwa ya matlo** (Housing costs): The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of housing.
*   **C: Banni ba mafelo a mangwe** (People from other places): The passage mentions people from other places *moved* to Charlotte because it's family-friendly, not that they are a negative aspect of living there.
*   **D: Go leka go itumelela toropo** (Trying to enjoy the city): The passage actually portrays Charlotte as a very enjoyable city, especially for families.



"
"Pele ga ba-Spain ba  goroga, Chile e e kwa bokone e ne e busiwa ke mang?","The correct answer is **D: Ya Inca**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pele ga ba-Spain ba goroga mo lekgolong la bo-16 la dingwaga, Chile e e kwa bokone e ne e busiwa ke Inca..."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche:** The passage states the Mapuche lived in central and southern Chile, *not* northern Chile before the Spanish arrived.
*   **B: Morafe o o tlholegileng kwa America:** This is too broad. While true, it doesn't specify *which* indigenous group ruled northern Chile.
*   **C: Batho ba ba tlholegileng kwa Araucania:** These are the Mapuche, and they didn't rule northern Chile."
".Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se se sa diragalang ka 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chile e fitlheletse go fenya Maspain**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Chile declared independence in 1810, *but* the complete defeat of the Spanish wasn't achieved until 1818.  Therefore, in 1810, Chile hadn't yet defeated Spain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ne go se na puso ya bogareng** - The passage says the Napoleonic Wars left Spain without a central government.
*   **C: Dintwa tsa Napoleon di lwelwe** - The passage mentions the Napoleonic Wars as happening around 1810.
*   **D: Chile e nnile le boipuso** - The passage states Chile declared independence in 1810.



"
Batho ba ka fitlha jang kwa metsaneng mo kgaolong ya Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka terena kgotsa sekepe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditselana, diterena, le mekoro di kopanya metse e, mme dikoloi ga di kgone go goroga go tswa ko ntle."" This directly translates to ""Paths, trains, and boats connect the towns, but cars cannot reach from the outside."" 

Therefore, you can reach the towns by train or boat, but not by car.



"
Lereo la Sentariane le le reng ‘Cinque Terre’ le raya eng?,"The correct answer is **A: Metsana e Metlhano**.

The text states: ""Clique Terra, mo go rayang Mafelo a Matlhano..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands...""  ""Mafelo a Matlhano"" directly translates to ""Five Lands"" or ""Five Villages"" – meaning five towns/villages. Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" means Five Villages.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa ditlhako o o tshwanetseng maemo a mariga a a ka reledisang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhako tse di nang le didiriswa tse di ka tshwarisiwang mo ditlhakong tsa mefuta e e farologanyeng ka bontsi** (Tires that have attachments that can be used on different types of tires).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Dikweekwee di tshwanetse go nna ko tlase di le bophara"" (Spikes must be low and wide) and ""Ditlhako tse dingwe di na le dikhokho, gape go na le didiriswa tse di ka tshwarisiwang mo ditlhakong tsa mefuta e e farologanyeng ka bontsi"" (Some tires have studs, and there are attachments that can be used on different types of tires). This indicates that tires with adaptable attachments are suitable for icy/snowy conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ditlhako tsa dikwaekwae tse di tshesane** (Smooth tires) - Smooth tires are *not* suitable for icy conditions, as the passage implies the need for grip.
*   **C: Ditlhako tsa dikwaekwae tse di kwa godimo** (High tires) - Tire height isn’t specifically addressed as a requirement for icy conditions.
*   **D: Ditlhako tse di se nang boteng ba kgatiso ya mm( 1/5 inch)** (Tires without a tread depth of mm(1/5 inch)) - The passage explicitly states the tread depth *should* be at least 5mm.



"
Ke efe ya tseno e e ka se thuseng go tokafatsa tsamao mo ditseleng tsa metsi a a gatsetseng mo marigeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Letswai**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Mmu, matlapana kana letswai (calcium chloride) ga ntsi di gasame gotlhe mo ditseleng kgotsa ditselana go tokafatsa tsamao."" This translates to ""Soil, sand or salt (calcium chloride) are not often spread on roads or paths to hinder movement."" 

Therefore, *letswai* (salt/calcium chloride) is identified as something that **doesn't** help with hindering movement. The question asks what *won't* help, making letswai the correct answer.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e tshwanang sentle magareng ga Hawaii le Setlhaketlhake sa Cook?","The correct answer is **C: Di na le nako e e tshwanang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E re ka di na le nako e e tshwanang le ya Hawaii, ditlhaketlhake tse ka nako tse dingwe di tsewa e le """"Hawaii ke Australia le New Zealand""""."" This directly highlights the shared time zone between the Cook Islands and Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bobedi jwa tsone, di na le dihotele di le dintsi, tse ditona** - The passage specifically states the Cook Islands *lack* large, resort-style hotels like Hawaii.
* **B: Bobedi jwa tsone, ga se leloko la Amerika** - While true for the Cook Islands, the passage mentions Hawaii *before* it became a US state, implying it wasn’t always outside of American influence. This isn’t a direct comparison.
* **D: Bobedi jwa tsone ga bo na ditoropo** - The passage states the Cook Islands have no towns, but it doesn't say the same about Hawaii.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, ditlhaketlhake tsa Cook?","The correct answer is **A: E nnye go feta Hawaii**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Le fa e le nnye, e gakolola baeti bangwe ba bagodi ka fa Hawaii e neng e le ka teng pele a nna leloko la Amerika..."" This *compares* the Cook Islands to how Hawaii *used* to be, implying it's less developed, not necessarily smaller in size. It doesn't directly state it's physically smaller.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurately described in the passage:

* **B: Ke ditlhopha tsa ditlhaketlhake** -  The passage explicitly says ""Ke ditlhopha tsa ditlhaketlhake tse lesome le botlhano..."" (It is a group of fifteen islands).
* **C: Ditoropo tsa konokono ke Rarotonga le Aitutaki** - The passage states: ""Ditlhaketlhake tsa konokono ke Rarotonga le Aitukaki.""
* **D: Naga ya setlhaketlhake e na le nako e e tshwanang le Hawaii** - The passage says ""E re ka di na le nako e e tshwanang le ya Hawaii..."" (Because they have the same time as Hawaii).



"
Ke afe a mafelo a batlhokomedi ba diparaka a a neelanang ka mefuta e mebedi ya maroko?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Sirena ke yone fela lefelo la batlhokomedi ba paraka le le neelanang ka lefelo la boroko le dijo tse di bolelo mo godimo ga go kampa."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that provides both lodging and food above the campsite.)

The other options are mentioned as only providing lodging (camping) without food.



"
"Go ya ka temana,o ka bona kae teseletso ya go phaka fa o batla go dirisa madi a seatleng go na le dikarata tsa madi?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go a kgonagala go bona teseletso ya phaka gotswa go mannong a batlhokomedi kwa **Puerto Jiménez**, mme ga ba tseye dikarata tsa madi."" (It is possible to obtain a phaka receipt from the ranger stations in **Puerto Jiménez**, but they do not accept credit cards.)

The question specifically asks where you can get a phaka receipt *if you want to use cash instead of credit cards*.  Puerto Jiménez is the only location mentioned as offering this option.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa go skiya o o dirwang go tswa kwa godimodimo?","The correct answer is **A: Go skiya ga go palama dithaba**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ke sika loo alpine skiing kgotsa **moutaineering le fa tota e se selo se le sengwe, tse di dirwang go tswa kwa godimodimo**...""  ""Moutaineering"" translates to ""go skiya ga go palama dithaba"" in English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go skiya mo sekgweng** - The text mentions this as *a type* of skiing, but not one done *from the top*.
*   **C: Mokgwa wa Alpine** - While mentioned, it's presented *alongside* mountaineering as options done from the top.
*   **D: Go skiya ka mesobana** - This is used as an introductory phrase to describe skiing in general, not a specific type done from a high point.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka thusang ba ba skiyang mo sekgweng, ba batla go bona mabelo a a kwa godingwana?","The correct answer is **A: Ditlhako tse di tsetsepetseng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...go skiya ga go palama dithaba...e bile go tlhoka ditlhako le didirisiwa tse di itsetsepetseng thata.""  It then contrasts this with being able to walk a long distance without a heavy bag on prepared slopes. This implies that *specialized boots* are necessary for more challenging skiing (and seeing steeper slopes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sekgwama se se bokete** - The passage contrasts having a heavy bag with being able to walk easily. A heavy bag is *hindrance*, not help.
*   **C: Mo seemong se se siameng** - While being in good condition is helpful for skiing generally, the passage doesn't specifically link this to seeing steeper slopes.
*   **D: Ditselana tse di gorutsweng** - Prepared slopes are mentioned as being *easier* (no heavy bag needed), the opposite of what the question asks about – seeing more challenging terrain.



"
Batsamai ba ba bowang ba tlwaela botshelo jwa ga bo bone ba se na go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele ba kgaratlhela go dira eng?,"The correct answer is **D: Go bowa ba tlwaela setso sa bone**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Batsamai ba ba amogelang ngwao le botshelo jwa lefathe le sele motlhofo ke bone thatatathata ba a tleng ba sokole go **bowa ba tlwaela ngwao ya bone** fa ba boela gae.""  This directly answers the question of what travelers who adapt to a new life struggle with upon returning home – it's re-adapting to their original culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amogela setso sa lefatshe le sele** - While they *do* adopt the new culture, the question asks what they struggle with *after* returning home.
* **B: O nne le boitshoko le go tlhaloganya** -  Being shocked and understanding are important *during* travel, but don't describe the struggle of re-adaptation.
* **C: Go ya moseja** - Going on a journey is the context, not the struggle the passage focuses on.

"Go ya ka temana, go bowa o tlwaela botshelo ba kwa gaeno o se na go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele, go ka nna bokete thatathata go mofuta ofe wa motsamai?","The correct answer is **B: Batsamai ba ba amogelang setso le botshelo jwa lefatshe le sele motlhofo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Batsamai ba ba amogelang ngwao le botshelo jwa lefathe le sele motlhofo ke bone thatatathata ba a tleng ba sokole go bowa ba tlwaela ngwao ya bone fa ba boela gae."" This translates to ""Travelers who deeply accept the culture and lifestyle of a foreign land find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own customs when they return home.""  

The passage explains that *those* travelers struggle most with re-acclimation. The question asks about those who find it *hardest* to adjust back home after not having lived abroad.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batsamai ba ba amilweng ke go tlwaela botshelo le ditso tsa lefatshe le sele** - This is too broad. The passage focuses on those who *fully embrace* a new culture, not just those who get used to it.
*   **C: Batsamai ba ba sa ntseng ba tlwaela go nna kwa lefatsheng le sele** -  The passage focuses on people *returning* home, not those still adjusting *to* a foreign land.
*   **D: Batsamai ba ba se nang boitshoko** - While the passage mentions the importance of patience and understanding, it doesn’t directly link a lack of tolerance to difficulty readjusting.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e batho ba tshwanetseng go efoga go e dira go moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Atamela o se kelotlhoko**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that people should *avoid* approaching a moose carelessly (""ba ka e atamela ba se kelotlhoko"") because they might not realize how dangerous it can be, and this puts their lives at risk. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Atamela ka bonya** - The passage warns *against* approaching at all, not specifically about approaching cautiously.
* **C: E iphemela fa e dumela e gomagomediwa botshelo** - This describes the moose's behavior, not what people should do.
* **D: Lemoga gore e ka nna borai** - While knowing a moose can be aggressive is helpful, the passage emphasizes avoiding careless approach *because* people don't realize this.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang ka moose, ga se nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Ke diphologolo tse di mafega** (They are strong animals).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Phologolo e e bidiwang moose (e gape e itseweng ka leina la elk) **ga e bogale**..."" This directly translates to ""The animal called a moose (also known as an elk) **is not aggressive**...""  Therefore, the passage *contradicts* the idea that they are strong/aggressive animals.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Ka dinako dingwe, ba ka baya matshelo a bone mo diphatseng** (Sometimes they can put their lives in danger) - The passage states people endanger themselves by approaching them without caution.
* **C: Ba ka e atamela ba se kelotlhoko** (They can approach them without caution) - The passage explicitly warns against this.
* **D: Di tla iphemela fa di dumela e gomagomediwa botshelo** (They will defend themselves if they feel threatened) - The passage states this is what they do.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang, ke eng se se ka se nneng borai go baeng ba sekaka?","The correct answer is **A: Fa motho a sa apara dilwana tse di bothito mo bosigong jo bo tsididi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go wela mogote wa mmele thata, go a kgonega fa motho a sa apara dilwana tse di bothitho."" This directly translates to ""It is possible to fall and seriously injure oneself if someone doesn't wear warm clothes at night.""  The text links this to the potential for harm (being ""borai"" - a negative consequence) for those experiencing the cold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the text mentions seeing mirages (itemogela meuwane e e dirang ekete o bona metsi), it doesn't present this as something that would be *harmful*. It's a potential issue, but not necessarily ""borai.""
* **C & D:** These relate to wasting resources (energy and water) when people collect things unnecessarily. The text says this is bad, but doesn't position it as a direct and likely harm *to the person themselves*.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang , e e sa umakiwang jaaka se se ka nnang borai go basepidi ba sekaka?","The correct answer is **A: Tlhaelo ya metsi (Water scarcity)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a mirage (meuwane e e dirang gore e nne ekete o bona metsi) can *lead* to water waste because a traveler might go towards it, wasting precious resources.  It also mentions the dangers of dehydration (go wela mogote wa mmele thata) and heatstroke (mo mogoteng wa letsatsi). 

Therefore, water scarcity itself isn't a *result* of the dangers described, but rather the problem that is *exacerbated* by them. The other options *are* presented as potential dangers to travelers in the desert.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Meuwane e e dirang gore e nne ekete o bona metsi (Mirage):** The passage says this *causes* wasted effort and resources, making it a danger.
*   **C: Go wela mogote wa mmele thata (Severe dehydration):** The passage explicitly warns about this happening.
*   **D: Mo mogoteng wa letsatsi (In the heat of the sun):** The passage states this can lead to illness, and emphasizes the importance of protective clothing.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke setlhopha sa baagi bafe se se neng se fokodiwe morago ga gore babatlisisi?","The correct answer is **C: Mataino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo dingwageng di le mmalwanyana fela morago ga go re babatlisisi ba Yuropa ba goroge, baagi ba ba-Taino ba ne ba fokoditse thata ke bathopi ba ba-Spain."" This directly translates to: ""Shortly after European explorers arrived, the population of the Taino people was greatly reduced by Spanish colonists.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mahaiti:** The passage mentions Haiti as a country sharing the island but doesn't say their population was reduced.
*   **B: Macaribe:** While the passage mentions the Caribe people existing before colonization, it states the *Taino* population declined after the explorers arrived.
*   **D: Baspain:** The passage identifies the Spanish as the ones *causing* the decline, not the ones declining in population.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke puo e feng e e neng e buiwa ke Macaribe?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The text states: ""Ba-Caribe e ne e le batho ba puo ya se-Arawakan..."" which translates to ""The Caribe were people of the Arawakan language...""



"
Ke mang a ka supiwang e le yo o neng a bula lefelo la ntlha la go skiya jaaka itloso bodutu?,"The correct answer is **B: Manowegian**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1861 ma-Norweigan mangwe ba ne ba bula lefelo lwa ntlha la itlosa boduto la go skiya kwa Australia.""  This directly identifies Norwegians as the ones who opened the first ski resort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ski bums:** Ski bums are people who *enjoy* skiing, not those who opened the first resort.
*   **C: Banni ba mo magageng:** This translates to ""people in the mountains"" and isn't mentioned in the text as the founders.
*   **D: Maausralia:** Australians are where the resort was *opened*, not who opened it.



"
"Go ya ka temana,e ka nna neng fa motshameko wa go skiya o neng o simolola go tseelwa tlhogong?","The correct answer is **A: Dingwageng tsa bo 18**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Motshameko wa go skiya, o simolotse mo dingwageng tsa bo 18-- bogologolo."" This directly translates to ""The sport of skiing began in the 1800s.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 5000 BC:** While the text mentions evidence of people skiing as far back as 5000 BC, it says this is *not* when the sport as we know it began. It's about the *history* of sliding on snow, not the formalized sport.
*   **C: 1861:** 1861 marks the opening of the first ski resort, not the beginning of skiing itself.
*   **D: Dingwageng tsa bo 17:** The text doesn't mention the 1700s as a starting point.

"Ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se, ka tlwaelo,se golagangwang le setlhaketlhake se segolo go feta lewatle la Botlhabatsatsi jwa Afrika?","The correct answer is **C: Diphologolo tsa naga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madagascar ke yone e kgolo mo go tsone tsotlhe, mme e bile go ka twe ke kontinente e e ikemetseng ka nosi fa go lebilwe diphologolo tsa naga."" (Madagascar is the largest of them all, and could even be considered a continent in its own right when considering its wildlife).

This directly links Madagascar, the largest island, to its unique and abundant animal life.  The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not as defining characteristics *of the largest island*.



"
Ke eng seo ditlhaketlhake tse dinnye tsa Botlhabatsatsi jwa Afrika di se nang sone? ,"The correct answer is **D: Go ikemela go tswa dinageng dingwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bontsi jwa ditlhakatlhake tse dinnye di **ikemetse ka nosi, kgotsa di amana le lefatshe la Fora**"" This means many of the smaller islands are *dependent* on France (or otherwise reliant) and therefore *do not* have independence from other nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Di amana le lefatshe la Fora** - The passage *states* they are connected to France, so this isn't something they *lack*.
*   **B: Mafelo a go iketla a mantsi, a maemo a a kwa godimo** - The passage says they *are* known as high-end resort destinations.
*   **C: Go lebilwe diphologolo tsa naga** - Madagascar is described as potentially a continent because of its unique wildlife, this doesn't mean the smaller islands lack it.

"Go ya ka temana, Paseka e ketekiwa jang ke dingwe tsa, segolobogolo,dikereke tsa setso?","The correct answer is **C: Ka phuthego e keteka bosigogare go itumelela tsogo ya ga Keresete**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Dikereke tsa setso ga ntsi di tshwara Tebelelo ya Paseka bosigo ja Lamatlhatso, ka phuthego e keteka bosigogare go itumelela tsogo ya ga Keresete."" (Many traditional churches hold the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday night with the congregation celebrating in the evening to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moletlo o o itebagantseng le tsholo** - While the passage mentions a connection to spring and fertility, it doesn't say *how* churches celebrate.
*   **B: Go tshwara Tebelelo ya Paseka bosigo ja Lamatlhatso** - This is *when* they celebrate, but not *how* they celebrate.
*   **D: Go bona tlhabo ya letsatsi** - This is a detail about a pre-Christian custom, not a description of how traditional churches celebrate Easter.



"
"Gore ba seka ba amiwa ke tlhokego eno fa o tsena ka Ecuador,moagi wa Cuba o tshwanetse a nne le eng pele?","The correct answer is **B: Lekwalo la taletso le le letleletsweng semolao** (A legally validated letter of intent).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ecuador e batla gore baagi ba Cuba ba amogele lekwalo la taletso pele ba tsena mo Ecuador..."" (Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive a letter of intent before entering Ecuador...).  This is the primary requirement to avoid being subject to the rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While a valid passport is always needed for international travel, the passage *specifically* mentions a letter of intent as the thing to avoid being affected by the rule.
*   **C:** A return ticket is *also* required, but it doesn't avoid the initial requirement of the letter of intent.
*   **D:** Having a US visa doesn't exempt someone from the letter of intent requirement; in fact, the passage states those with a US visa need to visit the Ecuadorian embassy.



"
Ditlhokego tsa Ecuador tsa mosepele ga di a direlwa eng?,"The correct answer is **B: Go neelana ka tshedimosetso ya tsa bofudugelo magareng ga dinaga tse pedi.**

The passage states: ""Ditlhokego tse di diretswe go neelana ka tshedimosetso ya tsa bofudugelo magareng ga dinaga tse pedi."" (The requirements were created to share immigration information between the two countries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tshola palo ya baeng e le kwa tlase** - The passage does not mention lowering the number of visitors.
*   **C: Go supa gore moeng o tsile go nna lobaka lo lo kae** - While a return ticket *shows* how long a visitor will stay, the *requirements* aren't about proving length of stay directly.
*   **D: Lekwalo la gago la mosepele le tshwanetse la bo le letlelesegile** - This is a specific detail *within* the requirements, but not the overall purpose of the requirements themselves.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka nnang tlhwatlhwa- godimo kwa nageng e sele go na le kwa lapeng?,"The correct answer is **B: Diforeimi tsa maemo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Diforeime tsa maemo fa di bonala mo mafelonga a ntseng jalo go ka nna le mathata a mabedi ; ga se tsa nnete, gape tsa nnete di tura go feta kwa di tswang gone."" This means that prescription eyewear (diforeimi tsa maemo) are more likely to be counterfeit or of lower quality in foreign countries compared to at home. This makes them ""tlhwatlhwa-godimo"" (higher risk) in a foreign country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tlhatlhobiwa matlho (Eye exams):** The passage suggests getting eye exams *at home* before traveling, so it's not a higher risk in a foreign country.
*   **C: Itshireletso ya tsa pono (Vision insurance):** Insurance coverage isn't inherently riskier in a foreign country.
*   **D: Diforeimi tse tse e seng tsa maemo (Non-prescription frames):** The passage focuses on the risks related to prescription lenses (diforeimi tsa maemo), not non-prescription frames.



"
Ke eng se se ka nnang le matshosetsi ka go reka diforeimi tsa maemo mo nageng e sele?,"The correct answer is **C: Di ka nne di a se nne tsa nnete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Diforeime tsa maemo fa di bonala mo mafelonga a ntseng jalo go ka nna le mathata a mabedi ; ga se tsa nnete, gape tsa nnete di tura go feta kwa di tswang gone.""  This directly addresses the concern that frames purchased in other countries may be counterfeit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tlhatlhobo e nngwe ya matlho e ka nne ya tlhokega:** While a follow-up eye exam is *always* a good idea when getting new glasses, the passage doesn't highlight this as a specific risk of buying abroad.
* **B: Lekwalo la ngaka la melemo le ka nne la se letlelesege mo diforeiming tse dingwe:** The passage *suggests* a prescription is important for safety, but doesn’t say the prescription itself will be invalid.
* **D: Itshireletso ya bongaka e ka nne ya se duele ditshenyegelo:** The passage implies medical insurance might not cover issues arising from frames purchased abroad due to lower labor costs and potential risks, but the main concern mentioned is authenticity.

"Tebang le tiriso ya ledi kwa Falklands, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang e e leng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Kwa ntle ga ponto ya Falkland , ponto ya Boritane, go le gantsi, e amogelwa gongwe le gongwe**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Diponto tsa Borithane go le ga ntsi di amogelwa gongwe le gongwe mo ditlhaketlhakeng le mo dikarateng tsa molato tsa Stanley..."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says credit cards *might* not be accepted in remote locations, but British pounds and US dollars *can* be.
*   **B:** While the text doesn't explicitly say Stanley is the *only* place, it implies US dollars are not widely accepted.
*   **C:** The text advises exchanging Falkland pounds *before* leaving the islands, making this statement incorrect."
"Go ya ka temana,fa o ya Falklands, o tswa United States, ke kae moo mokgwa wa tuelo, kwa ntle ga karata ya molato, o tla nnang molemo thata?","The correct answer is **A: Kwa lebenkeleng la FIC West**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Thekololo ya madi e diragala fela mo bankeng ele ngwe mo dikakeng tse, banka e, e bonwa kwa Stanley, go lebagana le lebenkele la FIC West."" (Currency exchange only happens at one bank in the islands, that bank is located in Stanley, next to the FIC West shop). This implies that FIC West is the place to exchange currency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mo ditlhaketlhakeng tsotlhe** - The text says credit cards aren't always accepted in remote areas, and you need to confirm what currency is accepted.
*   **C: Ke di ikadileng mo mafelelong** - Credit cards may not be accepted in remote areas.
*   **D: Kwa Stanley** - While the bank is *in* Stanley, the text specifically points to FIC West as being *next to* the bank and therefore the place for exchange.



"
Ke moletlo ofe o o sa golaganang le go dirwa ga meletlo ya tempele?,"The correct answer is **A: Go tsalwa ga tlou**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals are generally done to commemorate the temple, a saint's birthday, or a specific temple-related ritual.  It *specifically* mentions that in Kerala temples, even decorated elephants are part of the festivals.  This implies drawing or decorating an elephant (tsalwa ga tlou) isn’t a core *reason* for the festivals, but a *part* of how they are celebrated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Segopotso sa tempele (Temple anniversary):** The passage explicitly states festivals are done for temple anniversaries.
*   **C: Letsatsi la tsalo la modingwana (Saint's birthday):** The passage also explicitly mentions festivals are held on saints' birthdays.
*   **D: Meletlo e megolo e e amanang le tempele (Major rituals related to the temple):**  The passage confirms festivals can be for specific temple rituals.



"
Ke kae moo ditlou tse di kgabisitsweng di ka bonwang teng?,"The correct answer is **B: Ditempeleng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Meletlo ya ditempele tsa Kerala e kgatlha fela thata, go etle go bonagale gape le ditlou tsedi kgabisitsweng, baopedi ba kereke letse dingwe."" This directly translates to ""The festivals of Kerala temples are very striking, so you can also see decorated elephants, temple devotees among others.""  This clearly indicates the decorated elephants are seen *at the temples*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gongwe le gongwe, go tswa bokhutlong jwa Ngwanatsele, go fitlha Motsheganong e le fa gare:** This refers to the *time* the festivals happen, not *where* the elephants are seen.
* **C: Go a tle go bonale le ditlou tse di kgabisitsweng:** This is just a restatement of the fact that decorated elephants are visible, it doesn't say *where*.
* **D: Mo mebileng ya Kerala:** While the temples are *in* Kerala, the passage specifically links the elephants to the *temples* themselves, not just the general region.

"Go ya ka temana,ke mekgwa efe ya e e latelang, ya go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa mo karolong ya tsa bagwebi kgotsa ya maemo a ntlha?","The correct answer is **B: Fa o dirisa karolo ya maemo a ntlha go na le ya tsa bagwebi.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...go tlwaelesegile go re o ka duela selekanyo sa bontsi ga ne go gaisa tuelo ya tlwaelo, fa o dirisa karolo ya tsa bakgwebi, le bontsi ga some le bongwe go karolong ya maemo a ntlha.""  This means you'll likely pay more (be charged more) if you fly in first or business class compared to economy.  It doesn't say you *ask* for a discount (A), that you use a non-standard plane (C), or that being upgraded is a common practice in itself (D).  It explains the *cost difference* between classes.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se go ka se nneng mosola go se batla fa o batla go dirisa dikarolo tse di rileng tsa sefofane?","The correct answer is **C: Go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Fa re buwa fela, ga gona mosola wa go re o leke go fokolediwa tlhwatlhwa fa o le mo karolong ya kgwebo, kgotsa ya maemo a ntlha..."" This directly translates to ""Frankly, there's no problem with you trying to get a discount if you are in business class or economy class..."" meaning there's *no penalty* for trying to get a lower price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Difofane tse di tlhamaletseng (Regular planes):** The passage doesn't mention any issues specifically related to regular planes.
*   **B: Karolo ya kgwebo (Business class):**  The passage specifically states you *can* try to get a discount in business class.
*   **D: Maemo a ntlha (Economy class):** The passage specifically states you *can* try to get a discount in economy class.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""O seka wa lebala go tsenyeletsa ditshenyegelelo tse di okeditsweng ke dibukana tse dingwe tsa mesepele, makgetho a mesepele, sepalamo jalo jalo. gotlhe ko go etelwang teng ko ntle ga Afrika."" This means you *should* include fees from brochures outside of Africa when comparing costs. The question asks what you should *not* include, making option A the correct choice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ditshenyegelo tsa makgetho a mesepele mo Aforika** - The text says to include these.
*   **C: Ditshenyegelo tsa makwalo a mosepele a Aforika** - The text says to include these.
*   **D: Ditshenyegelo tsa dipalangwa tsa mafelo a a leng kwa ntle ga Aforika** -  The text says to include these.

"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se marekisetso a simolotseng go se kabakanya?","The correct answer is **A: Dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri** (Pre-prepared meals).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Marekisetso a simolotse go oketsa le go kabakanya **dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri**."" (Markets have started to increase and organize **pre-prepared meals**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Di-microwave** - While microwaves are *used* with some pre-prepared meals, the markets aren't organizing microwaves themselves.
*   **C: Marekisetso a dijo** - The text says markets are organizing *things within* the markets, not the markets themselves.
*   **D: Di sa ture** - The text mentions untrustworthy/unfresh food, but it's not what the markets are organizing.



"
"Ke eng se se tlamelwang ke marekisetso a mangwe, se se ka kgatlhang bareki ba dijo tse di apeetsweng ruri?","The correct answer is **A: Marekisetso a dijo** (Grocery stores/Markets).

Here's why:

The passage states that some markets are *increasing and stocking* prepared foods, even offering microwaves to heat them. This is what they are doing to appeal to customers who want convenient, ready-to-eat meals. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dijo tse di sa kabakangwang thata (Foods that aren't heavily processed):** The passage focuses on *prepared* foods, which are by definition processed to some degree.
* **C: Dijo tse tala (Raw foods):** The passage specifically contrasts prepared foods with those that aren't.
* **D: microwave:** Microwaves are a *tool* offered *by* the markets, not what the markets themselves are doing to attract customers.

Ke sefe sa tse di latelang tse di ka nneng di a se tlhaloganngwe ke ba-Belgium le ba- Switzerland ba ba buang Sefora?,"The correct answer is **A: Thulaganyo ya dinomore ya Sefora**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Segolobogolo, thulaganyo ya dinomore ya Sefora sa Belgium le Switzerland e harologana go go le gonnye le Sefora se se buiwang kwa Fora..."" This directly indicates that the number system in French as used in Belgium and Switzerland differs significantly from that used in France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E farologana le Sefora se se buiwang kwa Fora** - While true, the passage also says they *can* understand standard French. This is a general statement, not a specific thing they'd struggle with.
*   **C: Ka fa ba bitsang mafoko mangwe ka teng** -  The passage states there are differences in *how* they pronounce words, but they can still understand.
*   **D: Sefora se se buiwang gantsi kwa Fora** - The passage implies they *learn* standard French in school and *can* understand it, so it wouldn't be something they struggle with.



"
Ke eng sa tse di latelang se se farologaneng kwa France jaaka se le mo Belgium le Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Thulaganyo ya dinomoro** (Number arrangement).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Segolobogolo, thulaganyo ya dinomore ya Sefora sa Belgium le Switzerland e harologana go go le gonnye le Sefora se se buiwang kwa Fora..."" (Specifically, the number arrangement of French in Belgium and Switzerland differs significantly from the French spoken in France...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka fa mafoko otlhe a bitswang ka teng** (How all words are pronounced): The passage says pronunciation *differs* but doesn't say it's the main difference.
*   **C: Sefora se se tlwaelesegileng kwa sekolong** (Standard French taught in school): The passage states everyone *learns* standard French, making it a point of understanding *despite* the differences.
*   **D: Ka fa go kwalwang mafoko a mangwe a Sefora** (How some French words are written): The passage doesn't mention any differences in spelling.

Here's why:

The passage states that reduced fares are available with Air Canada, Delta Airlines, and Lufthansa, *and* WestJet. The phrasing implies WestJet is an exception – the passage doesn't say reduced fares are *guaranteed* with WestJet, only that they are included *among* airlines offering them.  Therefore, you might *not* be offered reduced fares when using WestJet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says you *must* apply by phone with these airlines, it doesn't state it's a reason to not receive a reduced fare.
* **C & D:** Lufthansa and Delta are specifically mentioned as airlines *offering* reduced fares.



"
Ke eng se e leng nnete ka ditlhwatlhwa tsa go ya diphitlhong ka tshoganyetso?,"The correct answer is **D: O tshwanetse go tsenya kopo ka mogala ka tlhamalalo kwa difofaneng.**

The passage specifically states: ""Mo maemong otlhe, o tshwanetse go tsenya kopo ka mogala ka tlhamalalo kwa difofaneng."" (In all cases, you must apply by phone in advance with the airlines).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions they *affect* passengers traveling with pets, it doesn't say the restrictions *are* the pets' fares.
* **B:** The passage says to apply by *phone*, not through the airline's website.
* **C:** The passage doesn't state they allow for pet travel, just that they have restrictions.

Ke neng fa tiriso ya GPS e e ikemetseng ka nosi e leng botoka le go feta ditiriso tsa GPS tsa go supa tsela mo mogaleng wa gago wa letheka?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa o se na neteweke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fa o sena kgolagano ya inthanete mo mogaleng wa ga go, kana fa go sena neteweke, tiragatso ya tsone e ka nna ya lekanyediwa kgotsa ya seka ya nna teng.""  This directly translates to: ""If you do not have an internet connection in the wilderness, or if there is no network, their operation may be limited or non-existent.""

Therefore, a self-contained GPS (one that doesn't rely on a network) is most useful when there *is no* network.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa o leka go babalela madi** (When you are trying to save money) - While the passage mentions saving money compared to buying maps, it doesn't say this is *when* a self-contained GPS is most useful. It's just a benefit.
*   **B: Fa o tlhomamisitse gore o tsile go nna le kgolagano ya inthanete** (When you have confirmed you have an internet connection) - This is the opposite of when a self-contained GPS is needed.
*   **D: Fa o sa batle go hira tiriso** (When you don't want to rent a service) - This is also a benefit but not the primary reason to choose a self-contained GPS.



"
Ke eng se e seng lebaka le le siameng go dirisa ditiriswa tsa go supa tsela mo mogaleng wa gago wa letheka go na le tiriso e e ikemetseng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go sa tlhwenyega ka kgolagano ya inthanete**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that GPS apps *require* an internet connection or network to function properly in areas without service. A standalone GPS doesn't have this limitation. The passage highlights the benefit of *not needing* an internet connection as a strength of alternative GPS methods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boloka madi:** The passage states GPS apps can *save* money compared to buying GPS devices.
* **C: Go tila go hira:** The passage mentions hiring GPS units as an *option*, not a reason to choose an alternative.
* **D: Go sa tlhoke go reka di mmepe tse disha:** The passage suggests GPS apps can avoid the cost of purchasing maps, but doesn't present it as a primary benefit when *comparing* to standalone GPS.



"
"Go ya ka temana, o ka netefatsa jang gore o nyalanngwa le sekepe se se maleba?","The correct answer is **C: Buka le modiredi yo e leng moitseanape wa maeto a Galapagos**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Netefatsa gore modiredii yo o bukang mo go ene ke moitsaanape wa Galapagos yo o nang le kitso e e tseneletseng ka mefuta ya dikepe tse di farologaneng. Se se tla netefatsa go re dikeletso tsa ga go lekana dikgwetlho ka go kgethega di nyalanywa le sekepe se se a tshwanelang."" 

This means booking with a Galapagos naturalist is the key to ensuring you're matched with a suitable ship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While a smaller group (8+) might be preferable for some, the text doesn't link group size to ship suitability.
* **B:** Booking far in advance doesn't guarantee a good ship, only that you get *a* ship.
* **D:** Booking early is helpful for availability, but doesn’t guarantee the right ship for *you*.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang,e e sa dirisweng jaaka metlhale ya go dira gore bareki ba nne nako e ntsi mo teng?","The correct answer is **A: Lesedi la tlhago ka bontsi**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly mentions the following are used to keep customers at the casino for longer:

*   **Lack of windows/easy-to-miss exits:** ""Gantsi ga gona matlhabaphefo le tshupanako, le mabati a go tswa ga a bonale bonolo."" (There are usually no windows or obvious exits.)
*   **Specialty food and drinks:** ""Gantsi ba na le dijo tse di kgethegileng, dino le tse di tlosang bodutu..."" (They usually have specialty foods and drinks…)
*   **Free drinks:** ""Mafelo magwe a naya bojalwa jwa mahala."" (Some places offer free drinks.)

Option **B: Ditlhotlheletso di tshwana le dikarata tsa mahala tsa konsarata** (Incentives like free concert tickets) isn't mentioned in the passage.
Option **C: Bojalwa jwa mahala** (Free drinks) *is* mentioned as a tactic.
Option **D: Ga go na ditshupanako** (No exits) *is* mentioned as a tactic.

**Lesedi la tlhago ka bontsi** (Lots of natural light) is not mentioned at all. Casinos are intentionally designed to *avoid* natural light to disorient people.

Therefore, A is the answer as it is the only option not used as a tactic to keep customers at the casino."
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng seo mankge wa go betšha a tshwanetseng go se tila?","The correct answer is **A: Go tagiwa thata**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...le gale, go tagiwa go thibela go akanya sentle, ka jalo, mme bomankge botlhe ba go becha ba itsi bomosola jwa go sa tagiwa."" This directly translates to ""...and also, getting drunk hinders clear thinking, therefore, all gamblers know the trick of not getting drunk.""

Therefore, a gambler should avoid getting drunk.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke karolo efe ya puo e e simololang ka tlhaka e tona, le fa e le fa gare ga seele?","The correct answer is **B: Mafoko**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mafoko otlhe...ka nako tsotlhe a simolola ka tlhaka e tona, le fa e le ha gare ga seele."" (All words...always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Madiri** - The passage uses ""madiri"" (pairs) as something *distinguished by* capitalization, not what *is* capitalized.
*   **C: Matlhaodi** -  ""Matlhaodi"" refers to vowels and consonants, and the passage doesn't say those always start with a capital letter.
*   **D: Matlhalosi** - ""Matlhalosi"" means sentences, and while sentences start with capital letters, the passage is about *all words*.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka ketefatsang thata, go simolola mafoko ka ditlhaka tse di tona?","The correct answer is **C: Go kwala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...le go kwala go ketefatswa ke go tlhoka go itse go re lediri kgotsa letlhaodi a dirisiwa jang.""  This directly translates to ""...and writing is made difficult by not knowing how letters or syllables are used.""

Therefore, consistently starting words with capital letters (as described in the passage) *helps* with writing by making it easier to understand how letters are used. The other options aren't directly linked to the difficulty of writing in the passage.



"
"Kwa magaeng a kwa Malaysia, ke letshwao le feng le le rayang gore “tlaa kwano”?","The correct answer is **A: monwana wa bosupa o lebile mo mmeleng**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kwa Malaysia, bobotlana mo go ba letso lwa Ba-Malay kwa magaeng, go raya go re """"tla kwano,"""" go tshwana le monwana wa bosupa o lebile mo mmeleng..."" 

This translates to: ""In Malaysia, a small gesture in Malay culture at home, means """"come here"""", similar to a raised little finger pointing at the body...""
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke letshwao lefe le le ka rayang gore “bowa”?","The correct answer is **C: Go tsholetsa letsogo ka seatla se lebile motho yo o mo sadisang sentle**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a British person in Spain might *mistakenly* interpret offering a hand palm-up to the person *giving* the massage as a signal to ""come here."" This is because in Malaysia, a similar gesture (palm-up) means ""tla kwano"" (come here).  The passage highlights this as a potential miscommunication based on cultural differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tsholetsa letsogo ka seatla se go lebile:** This is mentioned as a general way to show respect (""dumedisa"") but isn’t the specific gesture meaning ""come here"".
*   **B: Go koba monwana wa bosupa:** This is mentioned in relation to Malaysia, but isn't the gesture described in the context of the British person in Spain.
*   **D: Go dumela ka tlhogo:** This isn’t mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se dirileng gore go nne le diphatlha tse di bipilweng ke marogo?","The correct answer is **C: Mabota a magaga a metsi a a gatsetseng a kgona go phutlhama**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Se se kgona go dira go re marogo a kapoko a bipege a bo a sa bonale."" (This can cause the roots of trees to rot and become invisible.)  It *explains* this happens *because* ""Mabota a magaga a metsi a a gatsetseng a kgona go phutlhama, ebile diphatlha tsa teng di kgona go tswalaga."" (The walls of water cells can burst, and their contents can leak.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: marogo a kapoko** - This is *what* is affected, not *why* it's affected.
*   **B: Kgatselo tse ditona di tlabe di kgokologa go tswa mo matlhakoreng** - This describes what happens to large trees, not the root rot.
*   **D: Kgatselo tse di tona tla bo di robega** - Similar to B, this is about large trees, not the root rot.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tseno e e ka bipiwang ke Marogo a kapoko?","The correct answer is **A: Diphatlha**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mme e elela mo thabeng. Se se kgona go dira go re marogo a kapoko a bipege a bo a sa bonale. Mabota a magaga a metsi a a gatsetseng a kgona go phutlhama, ebile **diphatlha tsa teng di kgona go tswalaga**.""

This directly links the flow of water (kgatselo) to the disappearance of marogo a kapoko and the sprouting of their diphatlha (seeds/sprouts). Therefore, diphatlha are what the marogo a kapoko produce when they disappear.



"
"Go ya ka temana,basepedi ba tshwanetse ba batlisise pele ka seemo sa lefelo lefe?","The correct answer is **B: Mafelo a kwa ntle ga Goma**.

The text states: ""mesepele epe kwa ntle ga Goma e tshwanetse go batlisisiwe pele ka yone go tlhaloganya seemo jwa ntwa e e tswelelang mo kgaolong ya Kivu Bokone."" This directly translates to ""any areas outside of Goma must be investigated first to understand the ongoing war situation in the North Kivu region.""



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se nneng keletso e e siameng go mosepedi mo Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Dintwa tsa kwa North Kivu di tlosa bodutu** (Conflicts in North Kivu create insecurity).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""mesepele epe kwa ntle ga Goma e tshwanetse go batlisisiwe pele ka yone go tlhaloganya seemo jwa ntwa e e tswelelang mo kgaolong ya Kivu Bokone."" (Any travel outside of Goma must be investigated beforehand to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu region). This implies that there *is* insecurity due to conflict. The statement in option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ke nngwe ya mesepele ya go lepa di-gorrilla tsa Dithaba, e e tlhwatlhwatlase** (It is one of the places to see mountain gorillas, which is endangered) - The passage mentions Goma is near a place where gorillas are seen, but doesn't say it's *endangered* or a prime location *for* seeing them. It just states it is a location *where* they are seen.
*   **C: Dithekesi tsa sekuta ke tsela e e siameng ya go tsamaya** (Motorbike taxis are a good way to get around) - The passage specifically mentions *boda-bodas* (motorbike taxis) are used in Goma, implying they are a common transportation method.
*   **D: Lekgwamolemo la kwa Nyiragongo le ne la apesa toropo** (The Nyiragongo volcano devastated the city) - The passage confirms the volcano *did* devastate the city in 2002.



"
"Teseletso ya go kampa kwa lefelong le le kgakajana, ya letsatsi la ntlha la Phatwe e tsile go nna teng neng?","The correct answer is **A: 1 tsa Ferikgong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tetla ya go kampa gope fela mo mafelong ao e simololang ka Motsheganong e nna teng ka di-1 tsa Ferikgong."" This directly translates to ""Camping permits are only available for locations starting with Motsheganong on the 1st of February.""  Since the question asks about a permit for a location starting with Motsheganong, the answer is February 1st.



"
Ke pholisi efe e e beilweng go sireletsa legope?,"The correct answer is **B: Diteseletso di nna teng fela ka 1 tsa Ferikgong.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""diteseletso ga e ntsi thata ka maiteko a go sireletsa legope, mme di nna teng fela ka letsatsi la ntlha la kgwedi, dikgwedi tse 4 pele ga kgwedi ya go simololwa."" This directly translates to ""Reservations are not very plentiful due to efforts to protect the canyon, but are only available on the 1st of the month, 4 months before the month of commencement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba tla thusiwa go ya ka gore go tsile mang pele:** This refers to how walk-up permits are allocated, not a policy to protect the canyon.
*   **C: Ditetla di bonwa fela ka dikopo tsa go tsena fela o tsamaya ka dinao:** The passage mentions walk-up permits, but doesn't say they are the *only* way to get a permit.
*   **D: Palo ya ditetla ga e ntsi thata:** This is true, but it's a result *of* the policy, not the policy itself.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka se tsogeng e bonwe kwa mefuteng ya dihotele tse di tlhalositsweng mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **D: Diphaposi tse di ntšhafaditsweng sešeng jaana ka ditlhabololo tsa segompieno** (Modern bathrooms with contemporary amenities).

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels from the 18th and 19th centuries. It emphasizes features like:

*   Luxury dining
*   Exclusive clientele (wealthy and famous)
*   Elegant décor (grand furnishings, fresh flowers)
*   Historical significance

Modern bathrooms with contemporary amenities (like those described in option D) would *not* have been found in hotels from that era. Bathrooms existed, but they wouldn't have the same level of modernization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bara ya nnotagi e e tswakantsweng le dilo dingwe** (A bar decorated with various items) - Hotels often had places for entertainment and socializing.
*   **B: Direseturente tsa maemo a a kwa godimo** (High-end restaurants) - The passage specifically mentions these hotels selling high-quality food.
*   **C: Go ne go nna bahumi le batho ba ba itsegeng thata ba nako eo** (They were frequented by wealthy and famous people of the time) - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e tlhagisitsweng mo temaneng ke efe ya tse di neelwang mo hoteleng, tse bajanala ba ka se di tseyeng tsia?","The correct answer is **A: Mekgabiso ya bogologolo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mekgabisa ya bogologolo, letlhoko la ditlamelo tsa sesha, le go bo e le tsa dinako tsele tsotlhe ke dingwe tsa dilo tse di dirang go re di nne dintle le go feta.""  This translates to ""Luxurious furnishings, the need for fresh bedding, and being from bygone eras are some of the things that make them more beautiful."" This indicates that luxurious furnishings were a key feature of these hotels, something a traveler could enjoy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Marekisetso a bojelo ka moapei yo o tlhomogileng** (Marketing with a famous chef) - The text mentions high-quality food, but not specifically marketing *with* a chef.
*   **C: Mafelo a maitiso a a ntshang bodutu** (Secluded entertainment venues) - While the text states they had entertainment venues, it doesn't specify they were *secluded*.
*   **D: Dituelo tsa boroko tse di tlhwatlhwa-tlase** (Lower floor rates) - The text focuses on luxury and high status, not low prices.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se basepedi ba ba etelang Greenland ba tshwanetseng go se tila?","The correct answer is **D: Go bitsa motho yo o tlholegang kwa Greenland le“Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Le ntswa o ka utlwa lefoko leo le dirisiwa ke batho ba Greenland, ga le a tshwanela ke go dirisiwa ke batswakwa."" This directly advises visitors *not* to use the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to people from Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text mentions crime isn't a major issue, not that there are dangerous areas.
*   **B:** The text advises wearing warm clothes, but specifically when traveling north and due to the long dark days, not necessarily year-round.
*   **C:** The text says internet access is readily available, not that it should be a concern for visitors.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang , e e ka nnang bothata go baetii ba ba etelang Greenland ba sa ipaakanya?","The correct answer is **C: Maemo a bosa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maemo a bosa a a tsididi ke nngwe ya diphatsa tsa nnete tse ba ba sa ipaakanyang batla itemogela tsone.""  This translates to ""Cold weather is one of the real challenges that unprepared visitors will experience.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Monang o o bidiwang Nordic** - The text mentions being aware of the ""Nordic"" season, but doesn't state it will be a problem for unprepared visitors.
*   **B: Bosenyi** - While the text mentions traveling north gets colder, it doesn't directly say ""bosenyi"" (coldness) is the *problem* - it's the *lack of preparation* for the cold.
*   **D: Banni ba selegae** - The text states that generally Greenland is safe, and there aren't really ""dangerous areas.""



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ga jaana e diriswang jaaka marekelo a konokono?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Ga jaana e dirisiwa jaaka marekelo a konokono, mme e nna e na le dilo di le dintsi tse di diragalang mo go yone, motshegare le bosigo."" which translates to ""It used to be used as a flea market, but it still has many things happening in it, during the day and at night.""  This refers to the Jardín de la Unión.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa bonweng mo Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Holo ya baitlami ya bogologolo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""e ga jaana Templo de San Diego e leng yone fela kago e e santseng e le gone"" which translates to ""there is no longer the old temple, which was the only sacred hall there."" This means the hall is *not* currently present in Jardín de la Unión.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tiragatso ya konsarata ka fa tlase ga moriti wa sekgele (Concerts under the cedar tree):** The text explicitly mentions performances held ""ka fa tlase ga moriti wa sekgele"" (under the cedar tree).
* **B: Legae la mogaka wa bogologolo wa marato (Home of the great lover):** The text describes ""Callejon del Beso"" as the home of the great lover.
* **C: Mafelo a go ja a a dikanyeditseng tshingwana (Restaurants surrounding the square):** The text says ""Go nale mafelo a le mantsi a go ja a a dikaganyeditseng tshingwana"" (There were many restaurants surrounding the square).



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke dife tsa dipolelo tse di latelang ka go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe, tse di tsewang di sa nepagala?","The correct answer is **A: Ga go tlhoke gore motho a ipaakanye thata go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe, ga go tlhoke gore motho a ipaakanye thata..."" (Hiking for a single day doesn't require intense preparation...). This directly contradicts a potential belief that it *does* require intense preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate as *false beliefs*:

* **B:** The text *states* that gradients vary and can be done in a day – it doesn't present it as a misconception.
* **C:** The text says ""mongwe le mongwe a ka kgona go itumelela se"" (anyone can enjoy it), which isn't a false belief, it's presented as a positive aspect.
* **D:** The text says families *might* need extra planning, not that it's always required – and it's presented as a practical consideration, not a misconception.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng mo go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe go sa tlhokeng gore motho a ipaakanye thata?","The correct answer is **B: Fa go dirisiwa tsela e e bonolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go palama dithaba ga letsatsi le le lengwe, ga go tlhoke gore motho a ipaakanye thata, ebile mongwe le mongwe a ka kgona a itumelela se."" This directly implies that *ease of the trail* determines how much effort is needed. A simpler trail means less strenuous activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa mopagami a itekanetse mo mmeleng** - While fitness helps, the text doesn't say it's *required* for a single day of hiking.
* **C: Fa bana ba ya go haeka** - The text mentions needing extra preparation *with* small children, not that it makes hiking easier overall.
* **D: Fa go pagama dithaba go akaretsa go tsamaya mo ditikologong tsa tlhago** - This simply defines what hiking *is*, not how difficult it is.



"
Ke eng se se farologaneng ka mafelo a a lekalekanang kwa Rogaland le Agder fa go bapiswa le Norway yotlhe?,"The correct answer is **D: Di nna di apesitswe ke ditlhatshana**.

Here's why:

The text states that in Rogaland and Agder, the flat areas (""hei"") are *characterized* by being covered in small shrubs (""apesitswe ke ditlhatshana"").  The text doesn't say the same about flat areas (""vidde"") across all of Norway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di na le ditlhare:** The text specifically states these areas are *without* vegetation (le sena ditlhare).
* **B: Ga go na dinkana tse di fa gare ga dithaba:** The text doesn't say this; it describes the flat areas *within* the mountains.
* **C: Gantsi ke mafelo a a lekalekanang:** While they *are* flat, this doesn't highlight the *difference* between these areas and those in other parts of Norway.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e ka se tlwaelesegeng ko Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Dithaba tse di nang le ditlhare**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""vidde"" is an open area *without* vegetation, and ""hei"" is an area *without* vegetation that's been shaped by small rivers.  It describes Norwegian landscapes as changing into flat areas. This implies that mountains *with* trees aren't typical of the scenery described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lefelo le le bulegileng (Open area)** - The passage directly describes open areas as common (""vidde"").
*   **C: Dinokana tse di fa gare ga dithaba (Valleys between mountains)** - The passage starts by saying valleys are common.
*   **D: Lefelo le le se nang ditlhare (Area without vegetation)** - The passage explicitly mentions areas without vegetation (""vidde"" and ""hei"").



"
Bajanala ba ba kgatlhegelang go relela ba tshwanetse go etela lefelo la dithaba neng?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka selemo sa se-India**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Paka ya bojanala kwa dithabeng, ga ntsi e tlhatloga ka selemo sa se-India."" This translates to ""The best time for hiking in the mountains is during the Indian summer.""  Therefore, those interested in hiking should visit during the Indian summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka mariga (In spring):** While the passage mentions flowers blooming in spring, it doesn't say it's the *best* time for hiking.
*   **B: Ka paka e bojanala bo tlhatlogang (During a hiking package):** This refers to *how* to hike, not *when*.
*   **D: Ka dikgakologo (In winter):** The passage mentions skiing and snowboarding, activities done in winter, but doesn’t suggest hiking is best then.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng fa gantsi go nang le bajanala ba bantsi go gaisa kwa lefelong la dithaba?","The correct answer is **C: Ka selemo sa se-India**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Paka ya bojanala kwa dithabeng, ga ntsi e tlhatloga ka selemo sa se-India.""  This translates to ""The peak of snowfall in the mountains is during the Indian summer."" This directly indicates that there's more snowfall (and therefore more skiers/snowboarders) during the Indian summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka nako ya sefako se se itekanetseng:** While the text mentions adequate snowfall, it doesn't say this is *when* there are most skiers.
* **B: Ka paka yotlhe ya go tshamekela mo kapokong:** This doesn't relate to the number of skiers.
* **D: Mo dikgweding tsotlhe tsa mariga:** The text links the peak snowfall to the Indian summer, not all of the floral months.



"
O tshwanetse o efoge go dira eng fa o solofela go bona sekepe se batla thuso?,"The correct answer is **A: O tsamaya mo maemakepeng** (You walk around the docks).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""O tla bo o ntsha dikitsiso o naya batho thuso, **o tsamaya mo maemakepeng**, o atamela batho o phepafatsa dikepe tsa bone...""  This directly links walking the docks with finding opportunities to help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tsalana le batsamaisasekepe** (Talking to captains) - While mentioned, it's a *result* of being on the docks, not the initial action to *find* a ship needing help.
* **C: Go bapatsa ditirelo** (Advertising services) - The passage doesn't mention advertising.
* **D: Go itlhokomolosa batho ba ba kopang go pegiwa mo dikepeng** (Ignoring people asking for rides on ships) -  The passage explicitly says you'll *encounter* these people and answer their questions, not ignore them.



"
O tshwanetse go dira eng kwa maemelong dikepe fa o batlana le sekepe se se tlhokang thuso?,"The correct answer is **A: O golagana le batsamaisadikepe** (You interact with ship captains).

Here's why:

The prompt specifically states: ""...o leka go golagana le batsamaisasekepe mo bareng..."" which translates to ""...you try to interact with ship captains in the bars..."" This directly relates to finding a ship needing someone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Se bonagale** (Be visible) - While being present is necessary, simply being seen doesn't help you *find* a ship needing help.
* **C: Bua le batho fela fa ba phephafatsa dikepe tsa bone** (Only talk to people polishing their ships) - Polishing ships isn't necessarily indicative of needing crew.
* **D: Ikgatholose batho ba ba kopang go pegiwa mo dikepeng** (Avoid people asking for rides on ships) - The prompt mentions encountering these people, but doesn't suggest avoiding them as a means to find a ship.



"
Ke lefelo lefe le le ka ngokang mojanala yo a nang le kgatlhego mo ditsong tsa sekolone tsa lefatshe le?,"The correct answer is **A: Ditshitshi tsa Bokone**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Se ke lefelo le ma-Boritane a pele ba neng ba le ikgapetse. Ka jalo fa o batla go bona ditso tsa sekolone tsa lefatshe le, o ka simolola gone fa.""  This directly links the Northern shore/districts to colonial history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The Kowloon waterfront:** While beautiful, the text just describes it as a place to visit, not specifically linked to colonial history.
* **C: Bogareng jwa Hong Kong:** The text doesn't mention a specific connection to colonial history in the center of Hong Kong.
* **D: Maemakepe a Victoria:** The text uses Victoria Harbour as a visual description (compared to a spreading fan) but doesn't associate it with colonial artifacts or history.



"
"Ke lefelo lefe le le ka gogelang mojanala yo o bayang kwa pele, go bona dilo tse dintle?","The correct answer is **C: Setlhaketlhake sa Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Setlhakatlhake sa Hong Kong ke sone se se fang kgaolo ya Hong Kong leina la yone, e bile ke lefelo le bajanala ba le kayang jaaka la kgogelo."" (The Peak of Hong Kong is the one that gives Hong Kong its name, and is a place tourists can visit as a sight.)

While Victoria Harbour and Kowloon waterfront are also beautiful, the passage *specifically* identifies the Peak as a place tourists go *to see sights* (a place to be wowed)."
"Ke eng seo disale tse dingwe di nang le sone, tse di thusang go fokotsa matshwenyego a pabalesego, a lenao la mopagami le ganeletse mo madulong a pitse?","The correct answer is **B: Dinakana tse di babalesegileng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...madulo a pitse, segolo jang a modiro wa kwa ga Mmamosadinyana, a na le dinakana tse di babalesegileng tse motho o ka itshwareleleng ka tsone go letla fa maoto a tsenang teng go wela fatshe fa go gogelwa morago ke mopalami fa a wa."" This directly explains that the flexible hooks help prevent injuries by allowing the climber's foot to release if they fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sola e e motsu:** While a curved shape is mentioned, it's not specifically linked to *reducing* the risk of injury.
*   **C: Fa maoto a tsenang teng:** This just refers to the area where the foot goes, not a safety feature.
*   **D: Di tshegetsa mopagami:** This is a general statement about pitse, not about features that reduce risk.



"
"Ke eng se se leng mo setlhakong se se faphegileng, se se thusang go oketsa pabalesego ya mopagami fa a dirisa sale ya pitse?","The correct answer is **C: Serethe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bapalami ba rwala ditlhako tse di haphegileng tse di nang le **serethe se se sola e borethe e bile e le motsu**."" This describes a feature of the climbing shoes that increases the climber's ability to hold onto the rock.  The text specifically links the *serethe* (rubber sole) to improving grip and safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sola e e makgwakgwa, e e motsu** - While the sole *is* described as being sharp and sticky, ""serethe"" is the overall term for the rubber sole itself.
* **B: Letlalo** -  The passage mentions ""madulo a pitse"" (pitse's holes/pockets) having handholds but doesn't say a ledge *helps* with safety, rather it can *catch* a falling climber.
* **D: Sola e e sephara** - The passage emphasizes the *sharpness* of the sole, not that it's flat.



"
Ke eng se go tweng se ka newa bajanala ka Maharathatha a bojanala?,"The correct answer is **A: Mafelo a bonno le benggae**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maharathatha a bojanala ke lekgotla le le kopanyang bajanala le benggae mo ditoropong tse ba di etelang."" This directly translates to ""Maharathatha a bojanala is a group that connects travelers with locals in the cities they visit,"" meaning it provides accommodation and local connections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Difofane tsa madi a a kwa tlase:** This refers to the inspiration behind Couchsurfing (Casey Fenton seeing cheap flights to Iceland) but isn't *what* it provides to travelers.
*   **C: Bakaedi ba selegae ba maeto ba neelana ka maeto a bojanala:** While Couchsurfing involves travelers helping each other, the passage focuses on connecting travelers *with locals*, not just other travelers.
*   **D: Kgolagano le bajanala ba bangwe ba ba etelang lefelo le le lengwe:** While you might meet other travelers through Couchsurfing, the primary function is connecting with *locals* who offer accommodation.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang tebang le Mafaratlhatlha a bojanala, tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Bajanala, ka gale, ba neelwa bopaki ka benggae**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go tswa foo, bajanala ba neelwa mekwalo ya pampiri kgotsa e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a enthanete, fa gongwe e patilwe ke bopaki kwa bajanala ba bangwe."" This means confirmation/verification comes *from other travelers* (bajanala ba bangwe), not from the hosts (benggae).

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B:** ""le fa ntswa fa gongwe go ka thokana le go rurifatsa itshupo ya gago go feta foo"" - This directly supports the idea that some organizations may require more verification than others.
*   **C:** ""Bajanala ba tla neelwa mekwalo ya pampiri kgotsa e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a enthanete, ya baamogelabaeng ba ba tla bong ba le teng"" - This is a direct quote from the text, detailing how travelers receive confirmations.
*   **D:** “fa gongwe e patilwe ke bopaki kwa bajanala ba bangwe” – This confirms that sometimes verification comes from other travelers.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa mojanala yo a ka se bonweng mo ntlong ya hosetele, e e kopanetsweng?","The correct answer is **A: Mojanala yo o mo dingwageng tsa bomasome a mabedi** (A young man in his twenties).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dihosetele thata di lebantswe banana - ba ga ntsi e leng batho ba dingwaga tse di masome a mabedi go ya kwa go a a kwa tlase ga a masome marataro - mme go ga ntsi bajanala ba bagolwane ba fitlhelwa koo.""  This translates to: ""Strong hostels were assigned to boys - mostly people between the ages of twenty and under thirty - but older boys were rarely found there.""

This directly implies that young men in their twenties are the *typical* residents of these hostels.  The passage contrasts them with the older boys who are *not* usually found there.  Therefore, a young man in his twenties is the type of resident you *would* expect to see.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mojanala yo a tsamayang a le esi:** The passage doesn't mention anything about traveling or being alone.
*   **C: Mojanala yo a tsamayang le bana ba bannye:** The passage states families with children are *uncommon*.
*   **D: Mojanala yo o mo dingwageng tsa gagwe tsa bo masome a mararo:** The passage specifically contrasts these young men *with* older boys/men. They aren't the typical residents.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo, gantsi, a ka nnang kwa hoseteleng?","The correct answer is **A: Balekane ba tsamaya le losea lo lo sa tswang go belegwa** (Partners travelling with recently placed foster children).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dihosetele thata di lebantswe banana - ba ga ntsi e leng batho ba dingwaga tse di masome a mabedi go ya kwa go a a kwa tlase ga a masome marataro"" (Foster parents are linked to children - often people aged twenty to under thirty). This points to young adults fostering children.
* **The passage also states:** ""mme go ga ntsi bajanala ba bagolwane ba fitlhelwa koo"" (but older singles are rarely found there) and ""Malapa a a nang le bana a ga a tlwaelesega"" (Families with children are uncommon). This rules out options C and D.
* **The passage mentions:** ""...dihosetele tse dingwe tse di kgonang go ba fa boroko mo matlong a a sa kopanelwang"" (some foster parents are able to provide accommodation in unrelated homes). This implies individuals or couples (partners) taking in foster children.

Therefore, option A best reflects the profile of people likely to be at the foster home described in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang e e tlhalosang ka nepagalo, go latlhela boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Ka metlha, e tsile go boela ko letsogong la gago, fa o e konopile sentle.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""tlhomamisa gore ona le bomareng ee siametseng go boela letsogong"" which translates to ""make sure that it and the boomerang are designed to return to your hand."" This directly supports the idea that a properly thrown boomerang *should* return to the thrower.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text doesn't compare the popularity of boomerangs to that of foreigners.
*   **C:** The text explicitly says ""Bontsi jwa di-boomerang tse di leng teng kwa Australia tota tota ga setse di bowang"" (Many of the boomerangs that existed in Australia are still being made).
*   **D:** While the text mentions boomerangs can be made, it doesn't say they're rare. It says many still exist in Australia.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e dirisiwang thata mo dijong tsa batho ba Java?","The correct answer is **C: Sukiri e e dirilweng ka khokhonate** (Sugar made from coconut).

The text explicitly states: ""thata di remeletse mo tirisong ya ... sukiri (bogolo jang sukuri e e dirilweng ka coconut ya Java)..."" which translates to ""strongly emphasize the use of... sugar (especially sugar made from Java coconut)..."".

Therefore, coconut sugar is the one used most often in Javanese cuisine, according to the provided text."
"Go ya ka temana , bolwetse jo bo tshelanwang, bo fetela jang?","The correct answer is **B: Ditshidinyana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bolwetsi jo bo tshelanwang bo bakiwa ke ditshidinyana jaaka megare, mothuthuntshwane kgotsa megare e mengwe.""  This translates to ""Infectious diseases are caused by organisms such as bacteria, viruses or other microbes."" 

While the text *mentions* bacteria and viruses (options C & D are specific types of these), it's the broader category of **organisms/microbes (ditshidinyana)** that are identified as the *carriers* of infectious diseases.  Option A (people who are infected) are *affected* by the disease, but don't *cause* its transmission.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se go itseweng se ka se bake bolwetsi jo bo tshwaetsanang?","The correct answer is **B: Megare**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bolwetsi jo bo tshelanwang bo bakiwa ke ditshidinyana jaaka **megare**, mothuthuntshwane kgotsa megare e mengwe."" (Diseases are caused by organisms such as **flies**, mosquitoes, or other flies.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Meento** - The text does not mention meento (ants).
*   **C: Dibakateria** - While bacteria *can* cause infectious diseases, the text specifically highlights flies (megare) as an example.
*   **D: Nngadule** - The text does not mention nngadule (worms).



"
"Ke mo maemong afe a go tlhopha kemedi ya webo go na le VPN e e sa tlhakanelwang, go lekanenetse modirisi?","The correct answer is **B: Modirisi o batla go tila dikganelelo tse di bewang mapolotiki le bagwebi ba ba lekang go bona gore motho yo o dirisang enthanete a bo a le kae, ka fa go kgonegang ka teng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Batlamedi ba di-VPN (virtual private network) tse di sa tlhakanelwang ke bone ba ba siametseng go dirisiwa fa o batla go tila dikganelelo tse di bewang ke mapolitiki le bagwebi ba ba lekang go bona go re motho yo dirisang enthanete o a bo a le kae."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While VPNs *can* mask your IP address, the passage highlights avoiding political/corporate tracking as the primary benefit, not just masking.
* **C:** The passage states VPNs mask *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.
* **D:**  High speeds and good service are *benefits* of good VPNs, but not the reason someone would choose a non-logging VPN in the first place.  The key point is privacy.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang ka di- VPN le dikemedi tsa webo, e e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Di-VPN di kgona fela go kaela gosele, pharakano ya http**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that VPNs ""kaela go sele pharakano yotlhe ya inthanete, e seng fela http."" (translate to: ""route all internet traffic, not just http.""). This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are true, according to the text:

*   **A: Di-VPN gantsi di neelana ka makhubu a a kwa godimo go na le dikemedi tsa webo** - The text says VPNs provide ""makhubu a a kwa godimo"" (higher speeds).
*   **B: Dikemedi tsa webo di ka se kgone go kaela go sele,pharakano yotlhe ya inthanete** - The text implies this by stating VPNs route *all* traffic, suggesting web proxies don't.
*   **C: Dikemedi tsa webo ke tsa boleng jo bo kwa tlase, go bapisiwa le di-VPN** - The text states VPNs are of higher quality (""tsa boleng jo bo kwa godimo"").



"
Ke eng seo se letlang mongwe go dirisa mogala wa setlamo kwa ntle ga fa ba nnang?,"The correct answer is **A: Megala e e mo mafaratlhatlheng a inthanete** (Internet-based phone calls).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that you don't need a local phone number to use a mobile phone (""megala wa setlamo"") while traveling. It then explains you can have a number assigned in one location (Chicken, Alaska) while physically being in another (Arizona) *using internet-based calls*.  This is the key point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nomoro ya lefatshe lotlhe** (International number) - While you *can* use an international number, the passage highlights the ability to use a number from a different location *without* needing it to be international.
* **C: Sathalaeteng** (Internet) - The internet *facilitates* the calls, but it's not the *thing* that lets you use a non-local number; it's the type of phone call.
* **D: Megala PSTN** (PSTN calls) - PSTN calls are traditional landline calls and are tied to a physical location.  The passage contrasts this with the freedom of internet-based calls.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se o tlhokang gore se diriwe gore o emetswe ke dinomoro tse di rileng?","The correct answer is **A: Reka nomore y lefatshe lotlhe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gantsi, o tshwanelwa ke go reka nomore ya lefatshe lotlhe kwa thoko e e letlang go re megala PSTN e go leletse."" (Generally, you need to purchase an international number from a store that allows the PSTN to call you.)  This is the key requirement for being reachable with numbers from different locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dirisa mogala wa setlamo sa kwa o nnang teng** - The passage specifically says you *don't* need to use a local mobile phone.
* **C: Bona nomoro ya selegae** - The passage says you *don't* need a local number from your home city.
* **D: Reka mogala wa PSTN** - The passage refers to buying a *number* that the PSTN can call, not the phone itself.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, go bitsa mafoko a se-Italy?","The correct answer is **C: Mafoko a ditlhaka c le g a ka go tsietsa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the letters 'c' and 'g' require attention because *how* you pronounce them changes depending on what letter follows. This can be tricky (cause confusion - ""tsietsa"").

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Di r tse pedi, di bidiwa ka tsela e e farologaneng le r a le mongwe:** The text explicitly explains the difference in pronunciation between 'r' and 'rr' (caro vs. carro).
*   **B: Bontsi jwa mafoko a bitswa fela ka fa a kwadilweng:** The passage starts by saying that many Italian words are pronounced as they are written.
*   **D: Go bitsa bontsi ba mafoko go farologana go ya ka gore di salwa morago ke tlhaka efe:** This directly relates to the explanation of 'c' and 'g' and how their pronunciation is affected by the following letter.



"
Ke dife tsa dibopego tsa Izmir tse di simolotseng pele ga bošeng?,"The correct answer is **A: Mafaratlhatlha a matona**.

The text states: ""Motse o bogologolo e neng e le Semerena, ga jaana ke wa bosheng, o tlhabologileng, e bile ke boremelelo jo bo tlhanaselang jwa kgwebo... Mafaratlhatlha a matona, dikago tsa galase ka fa pele le marekisetso a segompieno a kgabisitswe ka marulelo a dithaele tse di khibidu...""

This indicates the stone foundations were present in the ancient city of Smyrna (Semerena) *before* it became the modern city. The other options – glass fronts, marketplaces, and embellished decorations – are described as more recent developments.



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se e seng sebopego se se nepagetseng sa Izmir?,"The correct answer is **A: Toropo e ikadile go dikologa kgogometso**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Izmir is ""dikologilwe ke dithaba"" (surrounded by mountains), not that it *tried* to surround mountains. This is a mistranslation or misinterpretation of the original text. The other options are all directly stated as characteristics of Izmir in the passage:

*   **B:** The passage says Izmir has ""seemo le ditebego tsa Yuropa ya Mediterranean go na le tse di tlwaelegileng tsa Turkey"" (a blend of European Mediterranean and traditional Turkish aspects).
*   **C:** The passage explicitly mentions ""marekisetso a segompieno a kgabisitswe ka marulelo a dithaele tse di khibidu, mmaraka wa lekgolo la bo-18 la dingwaga, mafelo a thapelo le dikereke"" (modern markets, 18th-century markets, places of worship, and churches).
*   **D:** The passage states it is ""boemakepe jwa bobedi ka bogolo go latela Istanbul"" (the second largest metropolitan area after Istanbul).



"
"Lefoko, hanami, le kaya go bogela eng?","The correct answer is **A: Dithunya tsa ditšheri**.

The text states: ""Go bogelwa ga dithunya tsa Cherry, mo go itsiweng jaaka hanami..."" which directly translates to ""Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami..."" Therefore, *hanami* refers to the act of viewing cherry blossoms.



"
Ke mang a neng a tshware meletlo ya ntlha ya go bogela dithunya tsa ditšheri?,"The correct answer is **C: Kgosikgolo ya Japane**.

The text states: ""Kwa Japane, meletlo ya ntlha ya dithunya tsa dicheri e ne e tshwerwe ke kgosikgolo..."" (In Japan, the first viewings of cherry blossoms were held by the emperor...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kgosikgolo ya China:** The text says the *origin* of the tradition came from China, but the first viewings *in Japan* were by the Japanese emperor.
*   **B: Maloko a bogosi ba Japane:** While nobles also participated, the text specifically states the *emperor* held the first viewings.
*   **D: Ba maloko a bogosi ba China:**  The text does not mention Chinese nobles holding these viewings.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang tsa Jerusalem tse di ka nneng di a se ngoke bojanala?","The correct answer is **A: Botlhokwa jwa toropokgolo e mo tumelong** (The importance of the city in religion).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka ntlha ya botlhokwa ja toropokgolo e mo tumelo ya, segolobogolo mo mafelong a mantsi a kgale a Old City, Jaresalem ke nngwe ya konokono ya mafelo a bojanala kwa Israel.""  This directly links the city's religious significance *to* it being a major tourist destination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dinaga ka bontsi le United Nations ga di e tseye e le mošate wa Israel** - This is a political statement, not a reason for tourism.
* **C: E na le mafelo a tsa ditso** - While true, the text doesn't specifically say this *causes* it to be a popular destination. It just *is* a place with historical sites.
* **D: Mafelo a ditso** - Similar to C, it's a characteristic but not the stated *reason* for being a tourist attraction.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang jaaka se Jerusalem e itsegeng ka sone?","The correct answer is **B: Tlhotlheletso ya sepolotiki** (Political significance).

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *   **Ditso tse di kgatlhisang** (fascinating history)
    *   **Botlhokwa jwa tumelo** (religious importance)
    *   **Mafelo a tsa ditso** (historical and cultural places)

*   While Jerusalem *is* politically significant, the passage *doesn't* highlight that as something it's known for. It focuses on its history, religion, and cultural sites. The passage states that the UN doesn't recognize it as Israel's capital, which hints at political issues, but doesn't present it as a defining characteristic that Jerusalem is ""known for.""

Therefore, political significance is the one option *not* directly supported by the passage."
"Go ya ka temana, ke mothale ofe wa mojanala yo a ka se ungwelweng ke go reka Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Motho yo o etelang Kruger National Park fela** (Someone who only visits Kruger National Park).

Here's why:

The text states that a Wild Card ""allows one to enter *select* parks in South Africa, *all* of them.""  If someone *only* visits Kruger National Park, the Wild Card wouldn't offer them any additional benefit, as it's designed for those who visit multiple parks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The Wild Card is *for* people who visit SANParks frequently, not those who aren't.
*   **C:** The Wild Card could actually *save* someone money if they're concerned about entry fees.
*   **D:** The Wild Card would benefit someone visiting Kruger *and* other parks.



"
"Ke efe polelo e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo,Kruger National Park?","The correct answer is **C: Ke e nnye thata mo diphakeng tsa bosetšhaba tsa Aforika Borwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Kruger National Park is ""one of the most significant national parks in South Africa""** and a ""leading example of a South African national park."" This directly contradicts the statement that it's *small* compared to other national parks.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: E tsewa jaaka e e kgatlhisang e tona mo Aforika Borwa** - The text says it's ""one of the most significant national parks in South Africa.""
* **B: Diphologolo di farologana magareng ga dikarolo tse dintsi tsa phaka** - The passage states ""each supporting different wildlife.""
* **D: Baeng ba kgona go e fitlhelela ka go reka Wild Card** - The text mentions the Wild Card allows access to certain parks, including Kruger.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka nnang kotsi thata go bapagami go ralala dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo thata?","The correct answer is **A: Maemo a a bongola**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...solofela go felelwa ke mowa, mme o itlhokomele mo dikarolong tse di motlhatlogelo thata, **segolobogolo jang fa go le metsi**, e re ka go ka nna kotsi ka bonako.""  This directly links slippery/wet conditions (maemo a a bongola) to increased danger on the steep sections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mantswe a go gatiwang mo go one** - While present, these are simply aids along the way, not a source of danger.
*   **C: Logaga lo lo nnye** -  The passage says it's small and you have to crouch to pass, but doesn't indicate it's particularly dangerous.
*   **D: Megala ya tshipi** - These *provide* support (tshipi di neelana ka tshegetso ya matshwaro a diatla), making the climb safer, not more dangerous.



"
"Ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno, tse di sa bontsheng ka nepagalo, go ya kwa godimo ga thaba ya Machu Picchu jaaka di tlhalositswe mo temaneng?","The correct answer is **B: Ga go na tshegetso ya matshwaro a diatla go ralala dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo thata.**

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* ""mo dikarolong tse di tlhatlogelelang thata tsa megala ya tshipi di neelana ka tshegetso ya matshwaro a diatla."" (In the very steep sections of the metal ladder, handholds are provided).  Therefore, option B is incorrect and doesn't reflect what the passage says.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

*   **A: Le bapagami ba ba itekanetseng tota, ba ka nne ba felelwa ke mowa** - The passage says ""solofela go felelwa ke mowa, mme o itlhokomele mo dikarolong tse di motlhatlogo thata"" (It’s easy to get breathless, and you should be careful in the steepest sections).
*   **C: O tshwanetse go feta mo logageng kwa setlhoeng** - The passage says ""Go na le logaga lo lo nnye gaufi le kwa setlhoeng se o tshwanetse go feta ka sone"" (There is a small cave near the source that you have to pass through).
*   **D: Dikarolo tse di motlhatlogo di nna kotsi fa go le metsi** - The passage says ""segolobogolo jang fa go le metsi, e re ka go ka nna kotsi ka bonako."" (especially when it’s wet, as it can be very dangerous.)



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tsone e e sa itsegeng ka dijo tse di ratwang thata tsa Ma-Jorca?","The correct answer is **C: Dithoro**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions bread (borotho), vegetables (merogo), and meat (nama – especially lamb/kolobe) as being well-known in Majorcan cuisine. It also highlights olive oil as a staple.  However, *dithoro* (eggs) are **not** mentioned at all in the text. 

Therefore, eggs are the least known of the options when it comes to traditional Majorcan food, according to this passage."
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso mo temaneng, ke polelo efe ka dijo tsa hangi, e e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **A: Dijo tsa hangi e e pumpunyegang ka mogote, di apeelwa mo khuting e e bolelo mo mmung, e e gotediwang ka maje a molelo a a tswang mo molelong gore mafelo a a mo mmung a nne mogote ka tlhago.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the *khuti* (the oven) is heated with fire or geothermal heat to make the earth oven hot.** It doesn't say the *hangi* (the food) itself is geothermal. The geothermal heat is used to heat the *khuti*, where the food is cooked.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

* **B: Dijo tsa Hangi, go dirisiwa maje a molelo, e gone kwa Wellington** - The text says a hangi can be found in Wellington.
* **C: Dijo tsa setso tsa maitseboa, gantsi di apewa ka hangi** - The text explicitly states this: ""Khuthi gantsi e dirisetswa go apaya dijo tsa setso tsa maitsiboa."" (Hangi is often used to cook traditional Maori food).
* **D: Hangi ya metswedi e e pumpunyegang ka mogote e ka bonwa kwa Rotorua** - The text says Rotorua has hangi using geothermal heat.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang jaaka tsela e e tlwaelesegileng ya go gotetsa khuti ya hangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Gase**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *hangi* pits are traditionally heated by:

*   **Maje a molelo (firewood)**
*   **Metswedi e e pumpunyegang ka mogote (geothermal sources)**

It *doesn't* mention gas as a traditional heating method.  The duplication of ""Maje a molelo"" in the options is a distractor.



"
Ke eng se se ka dirang gore o lemogiwe ke monna wa phuthego kgotsa mosadi wa phuthego ka tsela e e kgethegileng?,"The correct answer is **A: Go rwala serwalo sa mebala e e phatsimang** (Wearing a brightly colored garment).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...fa otla ka sa gago, segolothata sa mebala e e phatshimang, wa go bona monyenyoo gotswa go banna mo phuthegong kgotsa basadi ba phuthego kwa kgorong."" This translates to ""...if you wear your own, a garment of bright colors, you will receive looks from men in the congregation or women in the congregation at the entrance."" This clearly indicates that wearing bright colors is a way to be *noticed* (and potentially judged) by members of the congregation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go bipa magetla a gago** (Covering your hair) - This is a requirement for women, not a way to be *specifically* recognized.
* **C: Mafelo a kobamelo a neela basadi ba ba tlang ba sa ipaakanya dirwalo** (Worship places give dresses to women who don't prepare outfits) - This describes a service provided, not a way to stand out.
* **D: Go apara mesese e e fetang mangole** (Wearing more sleeves than shorts) - This is a requirement for women, not a way to be *specifically* recognized.



"
Ke efe ya diaparo tse di latelang e e ka nneng ya se nne gone go adima mo mafelong a kobamelo? ,"The correct answer is **B: Marokgwe a makhutswane**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mo kgannyeng yone eo, banna ba tshwanetse go apara marokgwe a a thibetsang mangole. Tse le tsone, o kgona go di adimiwa fa o tsena ko kgorong..."" This means small marokgwe are provided for men to wear *over* their clothes.  It then says these are *not* washed after each use, suggesting they might be dirty or undesirable to wear personally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mesese:** The text explicitly states women *must* wear stockings (mesese).
* **C: Marokgwe:**  The text discusses specifically *small* marokgwe being provided. It doesn't say regular marokgwe are unavailable.
* **D: Dirwalo:**  The text mentions dirwalo as something women bring themselves, not something provided or restricted.



"
Moeng a ka nna le ditšhono tse dintsi neng go itumelela dinaledi fa a etetse mafelo a kwa Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa selemo** (For months of the year).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in the Arctic and Antarctic, you experience long periods of darkness (""bosigo jo bo sa seng - letsatsi ga le tlhabe ba godimo ga kgala""). This extended darkness is what makes stargazing particularly good.  This happens *for months* due to the tilt of the Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fa mafelo a se na baagi ba bantsi** (When places are sparsely populated) - While true, this doesn't *cause* better stargazing, it just removes light pollution.
* **C: Ka mariga** (By plane) - Getting there by plane is how you *reach* the location, not what makes the stargazing good.
* **D: Kgotlelego e le kwa tlase** (When humidity is low) - Low humidity helps, but the primary reason for excellent stargazing is the long periods of darkness.



"
Ke neng foo mogala wa sethelaete o ka se kgoneng go emisetsa mogala wa letheka?,"The correct answer is **A: Fa mogala o o bonalang sentle kwa sethelaeteng o ka nne wa kgoreletsega** (When a clear signal can be obtained from the satellite).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mogala wa sathalaete tota ga o emisetse mogala wa letheka, ka o tla tshwanelwa ke go re o bo o le kwa ntle ka mogala o o bonalang sentle kwa sathalaeteng go re o letse mogala.""  This directly translates to: ""A satellite phone doesn't substitute for a cell phone, because you would need to be outside with a clear signal from the satellite to use it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fa lefelo le le kwa tennyana-teng** (When the area is remote) - While remoteness is *why* you might *need* a satellite phone, it doesn't explain *when* it can function as a substitute.
* **C: Fa o tla tshwanela ke gore o bo o le kwa ntle ka mogala** (When you need to be outside with a phone) - This is part of the condition, but not the key reason for a substitute signal.  It's the *signal clarity* that matters.
* **D: Fa ba matsholo ba na le ditlhokego tsa tshedimosetso e kgakala** (When sailors have specific information needs) - This explains *who* uses satellite phones, not *when* they can substitute for a cell phone.



"
Ke neng foo mogala wa sethelaete e ka nnang one o dirisiwang go na le mogala wa selula?,"The correct answer is **D: Fa o ka nneng wa kgona go dirisa maranyane a mogala wa cellular a a lekaneng**.

Here's why:

The passage states satellite phones are used ""in remote areas with no cellular coverage.""  This directly implies they are used when *cellular signals are insufficient* – when you *cannot* rely on a cellular phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa o ijesa monate mo toropokgolong** -  The passage mentions recreational boaters, but not specifically in towns.
*   **B: Mo loetong ka mokoro** - While boaters use them, the passage highlights remote areas *generally*, not specifically being on a boat.
*   **C: Fa tshedimosetso e kgakala e sa tlhokege** - The passage says they are used by those *with* the need for discrete communication.



"
"Kgotlhang ka efe ya tse di latelang, e tlhodile boikemelo jwa Transnistria Republic?","The correct answer is **A: Tsa itsholelo**.

The text states: ""Ka ngwaga wa 1994, kgotlhang e e tlhodile boikemelo jwa Transinistria Republic...""  This translates to ""In 1994, a conflict led to the independence of the Transnistria Republic...""  Therefore, the conflict (tsa itsholelo) is the cause of the independence.
"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang,e Transnistria Republic e nang le yone, e e farologaneng le Moldova yotlhe?  ","The correct answer is **C: Go tlhomamisiwa ke UN**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Transnistria Republic ""is not recognized by any UN member state.""  This is a key difference between it and Moldova, which *is* recognized internationally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puo** - The text says Transnistria uses Russian heavily, similar to Moldova as a whole.
*   **B: Tumelo** - Both Moldova and Transnistria are predominantly Orthodox Christian.
*   **D: Madi a naga ya teng** - Transnistria has its own finances, but this doesn't fundamentally differentiate it in a way the text emphasizes.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke neng fa moeti a ka etelang Montevideo fa a solofela go tila maemo a phefo e e fokang?","The correct answer is **C: Ka dikgwedi tsa selemo tsa Bokone jwa Hemisefere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Montevideo e kwa boboatsatsi; mo dikgweding tsa selemo, go tlwaelegile go re maemo a bosa a nne kwa godimo ga +30°C."" This directly translates to ""Montevideo is in the south; in the months of summer, it is common for temperatures to be above +30°C.""  The question asks when a visitor can expect *warm* weather, and the passage clearly links warm weather to the summer months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa mariga tsa Bokone jwa Hemisefere:** The passage specifically mentions summer, not spring.
*   **B: Ka paka ya komelelo kwa Montevideo:** The passage states there are no distinct rainy or humid seasons.
*   **D: Ka dikgwedi tsa mariga tsa Montevideo:** Again, the passage focuses on summer temperatures.



"
"Go ya ka temana, moeti o tshwanetse go etela Montevideo neng fa ba kgatlhegela maemo a bosa a a tsiditsana?","The correct answer is **A: Fa e le selemo kwa Montevideo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Montevideo e kwa boboatsatsi; mo dikgweding tsa selemo, go tlwaelegile go re maemo a bosa a nne kwa godimo ga +30°C.""  This directly translates to ""Montevideo is in the south; in the months of summer, it is common for temperatures to be above +30°C.""  Therefore, someone interested in hot weather should visit during the summer in Montevideo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fa e le selemo kwa Bokone jwa Hemisefere:** The text mentions the Northern Hemisphere to explain *why* Montevideo's seasons are different, but doesn't say to visit when it's summer *there*.
* **C: Fa e le paka ya pula kwa Montevideo:** The text explicitly says there aren't distinct rainy seasons.
* **D: Fa e le mariga kwa Bokone jwa Hemisefere:** Similar to B, this refers to the reason for season differences, not when to visit for hot weather.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se se amanngwang le bataki ba mekwalokwalo ya mabota go na le tshenyo ya didiriswa tsa botlhe le tsa poraefete?","The correct answer is **C: Mokwalo le ditshwantsho tse di mo maboteng, tse di sa batliweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Le fa e se sengwe sa se segompieno, batho ka bontsi ba ka tswa ba e amanya le basha fa ba senya didiriswa tsa botlhe le tsa poraefete ka go dirisa pente ya seporei.""  This directly links *unauthorized writing and images on walls* (mokwalo le ditshwantsho tse di mo maboteng, tse di sa batliweng) to damaging public and private property.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mekete ya mekwalokwalo ya mabota (Wall writing festivals):** The passage presents these as a *different* aspect of wall writing, not the destructive one.
*   **B: Ditshwantsho (Images):**  While images are *part* of graffiti, the passage focuses on the act of writing/drawing on walls *without permission* as the damaging act.
*   **D: Botaki bo e seng tshenyo (Non-destructive art):** The passage contrasts this with the earlier perception of graffiti as vandalism.



"
Ke ntlha efe ya meletlo eo batho ba ba e tseneng ba tsayang e le botlhokwa thata mo moletlong oo?,"The correct answer is **D: O tla nako e sa le teng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ha o batla go nna gaufi le ditiragalo go batla o tla nako e sale teng go re o kgone go bona lefelo la boroko gaufi le ko mmino o teng."" This directly indicates that arriving early to secure a good spot is considered very important by those attending the festival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go na le bana ba bannye** - While the festival has family camping areas, the passage doesn't state this is the *most* important thing to attendees.
*   **B: Meletlo e na le dikampa** -  The fact that there are campsites is basic information about a festival, not what people prioritize.
*   **C: Di tshameka mmino go fitlhelela bosigo thata** - This is information *about* the festival, not something attendees actively value or prioritize.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng seo motho yo o tsenelang meletlo a tshwanetseng go se dira pele fa a batla go nna gaufi le ditiragalo?","The correct answer is **D: O tla nako e sa le teng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ha o batla go nna gaufi le ditiragalo go batla o tla nako e sale teng go re o kgone go bona lefelo la boroko gaufi le ko mmino o teng."" This directly translates to ""If you want to be close to the events, you must arrive early enough to secure a spot near the music.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go ya bosigo thata** - The text mentions events *going* late into the night, but doesn't say you need to arrive late.
* **B: Go nna fa go nang le dikampa tse di kgethegileng tsa malapa a go nang le bana ba bannye** - This is a detail about family camping, not about getting close to the events.
* **C: Go kampa kwa ntle ga fa meletlo e tshwarelwang teng** - The text encourages camping *at* the festivals, not outside of them.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo go sa siamelang baeng fa ba batla go itlosa bodutu bosigo kwa bokone jwa New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Dibara tsa metsana e mennye**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Se se le teng ke go re bokone jwa Mexico botshabelelwa ke go nna le bakgweetsi ba ba itshietseng nnotagi, bontsi ja bone ba le gaufi le dibara tsa metsana e mennye.""  This translates to: ""This is because northern Mexico is known for having many tourists seeking escapism, many of whom are near the bars of small towns.""  This directly implies that the bars in small towns are places where people go to escape and indulge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The text doesn't mention pueblos as places for escapism.
*   **C: Mafelo a borekelo:** The text doesn't directly mention resorts.
*   **D: Dikhasino:** While casinos are mentioned as places that serve alcohol and sometimes use famous brands to attract customers, the text *specifically* highlights the bars in small towns as the places tourists go for escapism.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae moo moeng a ka nneng a bona mafelo a a itsegeng a maitiso mo bokone jwa New Mexico?","The correct answer is **A: Kwa dikhasinong,diura di le pedi go tswa Albuquerque**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""bontsi ja mafelo a itloso boduto a di casino a a umakilweng fa godimo, a rekisa bojalwa...mo go tse di tona tse di gaufi le Albuquerque le Santa Fe."" This directly translates to ""many of the illicit establishments are casinos that are established high, selling alcohol...among those close to Albuquerque and Santa Fe."" The text also implies they are a couple of hours away from Albuquerque.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kwa pueblong e e kgakala:** The text mentions pueblos being a possible spot but does not emphasize them as locations for the establishments.
*   **C: Kwa dikhasinong, gaufi le Sante Fe:** While casinos near Santa Fe are mentioned, the specific information points to casinos near Albuquerque, a couple hours away.
*   **D: Kwa bareng ya metsana e mennye:** The text states small-town bars can be safe but does *not* say they are where these establishments are located. The text says small-town bars are likely safe from these establishments.



"
Baeng ba ba se nang madi a mantsi ba ka batla go se nwe mofuta ofe wa nno?,"The correct answer is **C: Bojalwa ba selegae**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bojalwa jwa konokono jwa selegae ke 'Number One', ga se bojalwa jo bo dingalo, mme gone bo a itumedisa e bile bo a lapolosa."" This translates to ""The local wine is 'Number One', it's not expensive wine, but it's enjoyable and refreshing.""  This directly implies it's a good option for people who don't have a lot of money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mofine wa kwa Australia:** The passage says New Zealand and Australian wines are good *for the speaker*, not necessarily cheap.
*   **B: Metsi a mo dibotlolong:** The passage specifically says bottled water is expensive (""motlhofo go bonwa"").
*   **D: Seno sa matute a maungo:** While described as tasty, there's nothing in the text to suggest it's a cheap option.



"
"Go ya ka lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng, ke efe ya di otara tsa dino e e ka tlhakatlhakanyang batho ba ba tsamaisang dijo?","The correct answer is **C: Sauvignon Blanc go tswa New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gona le mefine e mentsi ya kwa Fora e e ka nowang, mme mefine ya kwa New Zealand le Australia eka nna botoka."" (There are many wines from France that can be drunk, but wines from New Zealand and Australia are better to me.)  This directly relates to discerning palates and those who appreciate good food/drink pairings (i.e., people who are particular about what they eat and drink).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: espresso e ntsho:** While mentioned as a preferred coffee in Australia, it doesn't suggest someone with a refined palate. It's simply a preference.
*   **B: Number One:** This refers to a type of cocoon/silkworm and has nothing to do with food or drink.
*   **D: kofi e e tshetsweng mashi a lobese:** The passage states this *isn't* common in Australia, suggesting it's not a drink for those with specific preferences.



"
"Mokgwa wa go thopa, yo o neng wa tsaya lobaka lwa makgolo a mararo a dingwaga, o ne wa simolola ke setlhopha sefe sa batho?","The correct answer is **D: Ma-spain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batho ba Spain ba ne ba simolola motlha wa go thopa o o neng wa tsaya lobaka lwa makgolo a le mararo a dingwaga."" (Spanish people started the process of colonization that lasted for three centuries).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Ba-Payaguá & Ba-Guaycurú** were indigenous groups who lived in the Chaco region *before* the Spanish arrived.
*   **Ba-Guaraní** were an agricultural group who lived in the area, but the passage specifically states the Spanish initiated the colonization.



"
"Go ya ka temana,gore o kgone go tseega sentle fa o le kwa Paris, o tshwanetse o dire eng?","The correct answer is **D: Supa maitseo a mantle**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...go re o kgone go tseega sentle fa o le ko Paris, go batla o itshwara sentle, ka maitsholo a ba a bitsang ”bien élevé” (go godisiwa sentle)... Maitsholo a a tshosang a a ma-Paris, a fetoga ka bonako fa ba bona o supa maitseo a mantle.""  This translates to ""…so that you can get along well in Paris, you want to behave well, with the manners they call 'bien élevé' (well-bred)... The intimidating manners of Parisians change dramatically when they see you demonstrate good morals.""

Therefore, demonstrating good morals (maitseo a mantle) is key to being well-received in Paris according to the text.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa tseweng jaaka kakanyetso e e sa lolamang ka batho ba Paris?","The correct answer is **C: Go itshamekela (To be arrogant)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Paris is known for being ""bohula"" (rudeness), ""go sa tlotleng ba bangwe"" (disrespectful to others), and ""lenyatso"" (snobbery). It also mentions that Parisians' intimidating behavior softens when they see you display good manners (""mantseo a mantle""). 

The passage *doesn't* mention arrogance (""go itshamekela"") as a characteristic of Parisians.  In fact, displaying good manners is presented as a way to *avoid* a negative reaction, suggesting Parisians don't appreciate arrogance.

Therefore, ""go itshamekela"" is the characteristic *not* identified in the passage as a common Parisian trait.
"
Melemo ya Maemo a ntlha mo MetroRail ya Cape Town ke eng?,"The correct answer is **C: E tlhwatlhwatlase go feta thekete ya Maemo a Boraro**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ke itumeletse Metroplus e bile gape ga e a tlala mme tlhwatlhwa ya yone e kwa godimonyana go se nene..."" This means MetroPlus is more modern/refined (tlhwatlhwatlase) than the standard Metro (Maemo a Boraro) trains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Letoroko le kwa pele ga terena** - While MetroPlus carriages are at the front when travelling towards Cape Town, this isn't a *benefit* of the class itself, just a positioning characteristic.
*   **B: Ga e a tlala** - The passage says it isn't crowded, but this isn't unique to MetroPlus.
*   **D: Ke tlhwatlhwa e e lekanang le ya thekete ya Metro** - The passage *specifically* states the opposite - that MetroPlus is *more* modern.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se diterena tsotlhe tsa Cape Town di nang le sone?","The correct answer is **D: Letoroko la Maemo a Ntlha gammogo le a Boraro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Diterena tsotlhe di na le matoroko a ka bobedi MetroPlus le Metro..."" which translates to ""All trains have both MetroPlus and Metro carriages..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Letoroko la Metro le le sa tlalang** - While the passage mentions Metro carriages aren't full, it doesn't say *all* trains have this.
*   **B: Tlhwatlhwa e e tshwanang ya dithekete tsa mefuta ka bobedi** - The passage states the opposite: fares are lower than typical European fares.
*   **C: Maemo a le mararo a a farologaneng** - The passage only discusses two levels: MetroPlus (First Class) and Metro (Third Class).



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se setshedi se ka nneng sa se se dire?,"The correct answer is **B: Malwetse a ilwang ke mmele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ditshidi di baka go serega, **kgotsa mo mabakeng a a sa solofelwang di baka malwetse a a ilwang ke mmele**..."" 

This directly links *ditshidi* (insects/pests) to causing diseases that are transmitted by the body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baka bogwata:** The passage doesn't mention causing damage to crops (bogwata).
*   **C: Gasagasa tshwaetsego:** While mentioned, it's presented as *a result* of the pests, not something they inherently *do*.
*   **D: Go gobatsa:** The passage specifically states that the pests *don't* include those capable of preying or killing.



"
Dikarata tsa prepaid tsa mesokelatsebeng di ka rekiwa kae?,"The correct answer is **C: Mo mabenkeleng a mannye** (In a few stores).

The passage states: ""P: Mabenkele otlhe a mannye a na le tlhakantshuke ya dikarata tsa pre-paid tsa mesokelatsebeng..."" which translates to ""Few stores have a stock of prepaid mobile cards...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Setlhopha se se rileng sa dinaga** (A specific group of countries) - The passage mentions these countries in relation to *benefits* offered by some cards, not where to *buy* them.
*   **B: Kwa diteišeneng tsa diterena** (At train stations) - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Mesokelatsebeng** (At mobile networks) - While mobile networks *use* the cards, the passage doesn't say you buy them *from* the networks themselves.



"
Dielo tse di sologelang molemo di neelana jang ka dikarata dingwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Di kgona go bonwa fela mo dinageng tse di rileng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*some are restricted to offering advantageous calling deals for a specific group of countries.*"" This directly translates to ""some are restricted to offering advantageous calling deals in specific countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka dinomoro tsa mogala tse di sa duelelweng** - While the passage mentions using non-dedicated mobile numbers, it doesn't say that's *how* the advantageous deals are offered, only that they can be used to make calls without charge.
*   **C: Mabenkeleng a mannye** - The passage states the cards are *available* at few shops, not that the deals themselves are only found there.
*   **D: Ka go dirisa mesokelatsebeng le go duela tlhwatlhwa e e oketsegileng** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya ditlhare tse di latelang e e sa tlwaelegang thata mo phakeng ya Plitvice Lakes ya bosetšhaba?","The correct answer is **B: Moakere**.

Here's why:

The passage lists beech, spruce, and fir as trees *found* in Plitvice Lakes National Park. However, it specifically mentions a *diversity* of Alpine and Mediterranean *plants* (meaning more than just trees) and highlights the unique ecological conditions leading to that diversity.  The passage doesn't list ""Moakere"" (Oak) among the trees found there, suggesting it's less common or even unusual for that environment.



"
Ke eng ya diphologolo tse di latelang tse di sa tlwaelesegang tse di ka bonwang mo phakeng ya Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""capercaillie"" as one of the rarer animals that can be seen in Plitvice Lakes National Park.  The other options (Turkey, Matshwane/Pig, Cassowary) are not mentioned and are either common farm animals or birds not native to that region.



"
"Go ya ka temana,dikhoutu tsa lefelo totatota, di thusa ka eng?","The correct answer is **C: Go thibela go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dikhoutu tsa lefelo ga di na thuse ka sepe mo ditirong go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong..."" ( ""...local laws have not helped at all in efforts to crack down on illegal copying..."")

Therefore, the passage explicitly says local laws *do not* help with stopping illegal copying, but the question asks what they *attempt* to do. The context implies the *intention* behind the laws is to prevent illegal copying.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya tse di latelang tse e seng nnete , tse di bolelwang ka dikhoutu tsa lefelo ke dikomponi tsa metswedi ya tshedimosetso?","The correct answer is **B: Di thusa go tila go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dikhoutu tsa lefelo ga di na thuse ka sepe mo ditirong go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong"" (Local codes have not helped at all in efforts to crack down on illegality).  Option B claims they *do* help with cracking down on illegality, which is the opposite of what the text says.

Let's look at why the other options *are* stated in the text:

*   **A: Di tlhokega go naya dikhamphani taolo ya mebaraka e e oketsegileng** - The passage says ""Boikaelelo tota tota ke go naya dikhampani tseo taolo e e oketsegileng mo mebarakeng ya tsone"" (The real intention is to give those companies increased control over their markets).
*   **C: Ke kgang ya go dira lotseno** - The passage ends with ""ke kgang ya go dira lotseno"" (it's a way of doing favors).
*   **D: Ga di na thuso ka sepe mo ditirong go kopolola mo go seng ka fa molaong** - This is a direct quote from the passage.



"
"Fa o boela mo lefatsheng la gaeno,ke tsmaiso efe, e ka tlwaelo, e seng ya semmuso?","The correct answer is **A: Go phuruphutsha ga ba lephata la mosepele** (The inspection by customs officials).

Here's why:

The question asks for the *unofficial* process when returning to one's country.  While all the options relate to border control, only customs inspection (""go phuruphutsha ga ba lephata la mosepele"") is a common, almost expected, part of returning home that isn't strictly a formal legal procedure like checking allowed/disallowed items or declarations.  It's the everyday experience of having your bags looked through.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Netefatsa gore o itse se se letleletsweng le se se sa letlelelwang** (Confirming you know what's allowed/disallowed) - This is about *knowing* the rules, not a process itself.
* **C: Seelo se se beilweng sa dilo** (The declared value of goods) - This is a detail *within* the process, not the process itself.
* **D: Ba taolo ya dithoto** (Those in charge of immigration) -  Immigration is a formal, official process.



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang seo o tshwanetseng go se itse pele o boela mo lefatsheng la gaeno?,"The correct answer is **D: Fa nngwe ya dilo tse o di tsenyang di sa letlelelwa** (If any of the things you are bringing are prohibited).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that customs officials (le ntswa ba lephata ba mesepele) check what people bring into the country and can confiscate items.  Therefore, knowing what is *not* allowed is the most important thing to know before returning home.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct answers to the passage's core message:

* **A:** The passage mentions a place for declaration, but knowing *what* to declare is more important than knowing *that* there is a place.
* **B:** This refers to exceeding the legal limit, which is a *consequence* of not knowing the rules, not the core information you need beforehand.
* **C:** The passage mentions customs control, but simply knowing there *is* control doesn't help you avoid issues.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se leng ka bontsi, se se kgontshang bapagami go atisa go ipetlela ditsela tse diša mo teng ga Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **C: Mafelo a a kgatlhisang** (Interesting places).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditlhoa tsa dithaba di kgontsha motho go bona **mafelo a a kgatlhisang**.""  It then says these interesting places encourage climbers to attempt difficult routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go bona mafelo (Seeing places):** While seeing places is *part* of it, the passage specifies they are *interesting* places.
*   **B: Ditlhoa (Peaks/Heads):** The peaks *allow* you to see the interesting places, but they aren’t what attract the climbers.
*   **D: Mabota (Walls):** The passage mentions granite walls, but it’s the views of interesting places enabled by those walls, not the walls themselves, that attract climbers.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso e e neilweng mo temaneng, ke mang yo a fetang mo makgabaganyong a mantsi mo Sephatlong sa Borwa?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Mme gone, Star Alliance e tsamaya gotlhe kwa ntle ga botlhaba jwa Borwa jwa Pacific go tswa kwa Santiago de Chile go ya kwa Tahiti..."".  It then implies this means they operate more flights in the South Pacific than other alliances.  The passage also explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't have many flights there.
"
"Ke kgolagano efe ya difofane, e e fetang mo palong e nnye thata ya makgabaganyo mo Sephatlong sa Borwa?","The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mme gone, Star Alliance e tsamaya gotlhe kwa ntle ga botlhaba jwa Borwa jwa Pacific go tswa kwa Santiago de Chile go ya kwa Tahiti..."" which translates to ""However, Star Alliance travels extensively outside the south-eastern Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti...""  This indicates they have the most connections in the Southern Hemisphere, even though connections are scarce overall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Borwa jwa Pacific** - This is a geographic location, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld** - The passage mentions LATAM operating the Tahiti route *within* Star Alliance's wider network, but doesn’t say they have the most overall connections.
*   **D: SkyTeam** - The passage states SkyTeam doesn't operate much in the Southern Hemisphere (""SkyTeam ga se fete mo go lepe"").



"
"Ke mokgatlho ofe o o dirang tiro ya go bontsha bajanala lefelo , o o tlileng morago ga Global Running Tours?","The correct answer is **C: Running Tours ya Prague**.

Here's why:

The text states that Global Running Tours *merged with* Running Tours Prague, along with others. This implies Running Tours Prague came *after* Global Running Tours in terms of development/expansion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Running ya Copenhagen:** This was one of the original companies *before* Global Running Tours was formed.
*   **B: Go Running Tours:** This is the name of Global Running Tours, not a separate entity that came after.
*   **D: Running Tours ya ko Barcelona:**  This was also an original company, predating Global Running Tours."
"Go ya ka temana, Go Running Tours e thusa go golaganya ditlhopha di le kae tse di farologaneng tsa batabogi?","The correct answer is **C: Lesome-le-bobedi**.

The passage states: ""Motlhatlhami wa Globala Running Tours, Go Running Tours o golaganya ditlhopha di le lesome-le-bobedi tsa batlamedi ba batabogi ba lefelo mo dikontinenteng di le nne.""  This directly translates to ""Global Running Tours founder, Go Running Tours coordinates twelve groups of local running enthusiasts across four continents.""
"
Mojanala o tshwanetse a dire eng fa a solofela go bona letose sentle?,"The correct answer is **A: Eya hiking safari**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ditau, dinkwe le matotse di na le ditlhong nako dingwe mme o ka se bona botoka fa o dirisa dibonela-kgakala."" (Tau, dikgwe le matotse di tlhong nako dingwe mme ga o bone sentle le dibonela-kgakala).  It then goes on to say that a *hiking safari* (safari ya dinao) is a good way to see these animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eya safaring ya dinao ya sekgwa** - While a hiking safari *can* be in the bush, the passage doesn't specify it *needs* to be.
* **C: Didiriswa tsa go bonela kgakala** - The passage says these are *not* helpful for seeing these animals.
* **D: Tsaya koloi mme o dirise didiriswa tse di tlwaelegileng** - The passage suggests animals like tau are harder to see from a car using standard binoculars.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa phologolo o moeng a ka nneng a kopana le one ka nako ya leeto ka koloi?","The correct answer is **B: Dithutlwa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ditlou le dithutlwa di rata ga atamela dikoloi mme fa o tshotse dididrisiwa dingwe le dingwe fela le tse di sa tureng tota o ka kgona go di bona sentle.""  This translates to ""Elephants and **antelopes** like to approach cars and if you take some pictures you can see them well.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ditau (Lions):** The text mentions lions (""Ditau"") having manes but says you likely *won't* see them well with binoculars.
*   **C: Dinkwe (Wild dogs):** The text mentions wild dogs (""Dinkwe"") having manes but says you likely *won't* see them well with binoculars.
*   **D: Matotse (Baboons):** The text mentions baboons (""Matotse"") having manes but says you likely *won't* see them well with binoculars.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka dirang gore leeto le nne tlhwatlhwatlase?","The correct answer is **D: Kopana le batho ba bangwe, le itireng segopana sa batho ba le barataro le go feta**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...leka go kopana le batho ba bangwe le itireng segopana sa batho ba le bane go fitlha go ba le barataro..."" which means ""try to meet other people and form a group of four to seven people."" This is what makes the trip *tlhwatlhwatlase* (seemingly chaotic or frustrating).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fa o le mongwe** - The passage says being alone is the *starting point* to avoid the chaos, not what *causes* it.
*   **B: Kopana le batho ba bangwe, le itireng segopana sa batho ba le bane** - While mentioned, the passage specifies *up to* seven people, making 'barataro le go feta' (and more) more accurate.
*   **C: O tsamaya le tsala e le nngwe fela** -  Again, this is the opposite of what causes the chaos; it's a way to *avoid* it.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo o ka nneng a bona seelo se se gaisang sa leeto?","The correct answer is **B: Segopa sa batho ba le bararo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...le kgone go bona seelo se se botoka sa motho ka mongwe...le itireng segopana sa batho ba le bane go fitlha go ba le barataro"". This directly implies that a group of three people is the size needed to properly assess individual character (""seelo se se botoka sa motho ka mongwe"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bajanala ba a fapanngwa go tlatsa dikoloi** - This is mentioned as an example of something unrelated and distracting.
*   **C: Ditsala tse pedi, di tsamaya mmogo** - The passage suggests needing more than two people for accurate assessment.
*   **D: Segopa sa batho ba le batlhano** - The passage specifically mentions up to *three* people, not five.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se dirileng gore San Francisco e itsege lefatshe ka bophara?","The correct answer is **A: Go supiwa thata ga yone mo botaking bo bo farologaneng le mo dibukeng** (Its extensive portrayal in mining, films, and books).

The passage states: ""Go supiwa thata ga yone mo mminong, mo difiliming, mo di dibukeng le ka kakaretso fela, di dirile gore toropo eno e itsege lefatshe ka bophara."" This directly explains why San Francisco became world-famous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mafaratlhatlha a magolo a bojanala** (Large cultural attractions) - While these contribute to the city's appeal, the passage says they *are found in* San Francisco, not that they *made* it famous.
*   **C: Itsholelo e kabakanye** (Complex history) - History is important, but the passage doesn’t state this is what made it globally known.
*   **D: Dijo tsa Asia ka mefuta yotlhe** (All types of Asian cuisine) - This is a characteristic of the city, not the reason for its worldwide recognition.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa dipolelo ka San Francisco tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **D: Itsholelo e remeletse mo bojanaleng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""E re le ntswa itsholelo ya San Francisco e remeletse mo bojanaleng jwa maemo a a kwa godimo, itsholelo ya yone e kabakanye.""  This means the *history* of San Francisco is rooted in high society, but its *character* is refined/sophisticated.  The statement ""Itsholelo e remeletse mo bojanaleng"" (the history is rooted in high society) is true *according to the text*, but the text also clarifies that this isn't the whole story – its character is more nuanced.  The question asks for a statement that is *not* true, and focusing solely on the “rooted in high society” part is misleading without the rest of the sentence.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true, based on the text:

*   **A: E supilwe thata mo difiliming le dibukeng** – The text explicitly says it's frequently depicted in movies and books.
*   **B: Lefelo le le botoka thata kwa go nang le dijo tsa Asia** – The text confirms this, stating it has a great variety of Asian cuisines.
*   **C: Go na le dihotele di le mmalwa le mafelo a maemo a kwa godimo a go tshwarelwang diphuthego mo one** – The text mentions large luxury industries including many hotels and high-end event venues.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke mofuta ofe wa mojanala yo a ka nneng a se bone molemo wa go dirisa ditirelo tsa barulaganyi ba mesepele?","The correct answer is **D: Mojanala yo o beeletsang maeto a akaretsang tsotlhe (dijo,boroko, dipalangwa, jalojalo)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents *used to* sell all-inclusive trips covering meals, accommodation, and transportation. This indicates someone who wants a completely packaged and organized trip would benefit most from using a travel agent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa o tlhoka go ikakanya ka se ba go fang sone** - While agents can help with clarifying details, it's not the *primary* benefit.
* **B: Le fa ka dinako dingwe go na le kgonagalo ya gore o iponele mefuta e mengwe ya boroko, jaaka go kampa** - The passage mentions camping as an option *with* the agent's help, not as a reason to *use* an agent.
* **C: Ba kgona go rulaganya dipampiri tse dingwe tsa mesepele, jaaka Visa** - This is a service they offer, but again, not the main reason someone would choose to use them.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le molemo wa go beeletsa ka barulaganyi ba mesepele?","The correct answer is **C: Maeto a a akaretsang tsotlhe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents *used to* sell all-inclusive trips (food, accommodation, flights).  However, the passage focuses on what they *currently* do – helping with visas, coordinating with hotels, and assisting with applications.  The all-inclusive trip offering is presented as something from the past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rulaganya dipampiri tse dingwe tsa mesepele, jaaka Visa:** The passage *explicitly* states they help with paperwork like visas.
*   **B: Barulaganya-mesepele ba dirisanya le dihotele dingwe tse di rileng:** The passage states they work with reputable hotels.
*   **D: Ba kgona go go tshegeletsa kopo:** The passage states they can follow up on your request/application.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se ditiriso tsa thanolo ya mafoko tse di direlang ka bonako di sa kgoneng go se dira?","The correct answer is **D: Go ranolola ka nepagalo, ka dinako tsotlhe.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mme jaanong ga ntsi di neelana ka bontsi kgotsa bobotlana dithanolo tse di siameng (mme ke ka sewelo di neelang thanolo e sa utlwaleng), mme go tlhokega go re di elwe tlhoko, e re ka di santse di ka ranola ka tsela e e phoso.""

This translates to: ""...and now many do not consistently provide accurate translations (and often provide inaccurate translations), and it is necessary to pay attention to them, as they can still translate incorrectly.""

This directly indicates that accurate translation tools *cannot* always translate accurately.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go ranola mafoko a dipuo tsa dinaga di sele mo matshwaong** - The text *says* they *can* do this (""...go ranola mafoko a dipuo tsa dinaga di sele mo matshwaong..."").
*   **B: Go ranolola seele sotlhe jaaka se ntse** - The text states they *can* do this.
*   **C: Go ranolola sekwalwa ka go supa ka mogala wa letheka** - The text states they *can* do this.



"
Ke eng se se kgontshang thanolo go dirwa go se na inthanete?,"The correct answer is **A: Dienjene tsa thanolo tse di tokafaditsweng** (Advanced translation engines).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dienjene tsa thanolo di tokafaditswe ka selekanyo se se kwa godimo tota, mme jaanong ga ntsi di neelana ka bontsi kgotsa bobotlana dithanolo tse di siameng (mme ke ka sewelo di neelang thanolo e sa utlwaleng), mme go tlhokega go re di elwe tlhoko, e re ka di santse di ka ranola ka tsela e e phoso."" This translates to: ""Translation engines have been improved to a very high degree, and now many offer accurate translations with less size or weight (though they sometimes give unintelligible translations), and need to be carefully considered as they can still translate incorrectly.""

This implies that *because* these engines are advanced, they can operate offline (although still requiring careful attention to accuracy). The passage then gives Google Translate as an example of a tool that *requires* internet access, highlighting the difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mogala wa letheka** (Touchscreen) - This is simply a method of *inputting* information, not the technology enabling offline translation.
*   **C: Laisolola tshedimosetso ya puo e o e batlang** (Isolating the information of the language you want) - This is a *process* within translation, not the enabling technology for offline use.
*   **D: Ditiriso tsa thanolo tse di direlang ka bonako, tse di mo setlhopheng seno** (Accurate translation applications in this context) - This is too broad. The passage points to *advanced engines* specifically, not just any accurate application.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa iseng kapoko kwa tlase?","The correct answer is **A: Kapoko e a kgomarela** (The snowpack is unstable).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""bothata ke gore kapoko e a kgomarela, ka jalo e tlhoka go isiwa kwa tlase"" - which means ""the problem is that the snowpack is unstable, therefore it needs to be brought down"".  This directly links the unstable snowpack to the need to be brought down to prevent avalanches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Batho** (People) - The passage mentions people can *trigger* avalanches, but they aren't the thing being brought down.
* **C: Phatsimo ya letsatsi** (Sun pressure) -  The sun is a *cause* of instability, but not what needs to be removed.
* **D: Go wa ga sefako se se oketsegileng** (Increased snowfall) - Increased snowfall is also a *cause* of instability, not what needs to be brought down.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa tse di latelang, tse di kgokologang e le diavalanche?","The correct answer is **C: Kapoko e ntsi thata mo letlhakoreng la thaba**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Ga kapoko e nna ntsi thata, e kgokologa le thaba e le avalanche."" This directly links a thick snowpack (kapoko e ntsi thata) on the mountainside to causing an avalanche.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kapoko e e kgomarelang, e sa isiwa kwa tlase** - The text mentions the snowpack *needs* to be removed, but doesn't say it *becomes* an avalanche when it isn't.
*   **B: Letlhakore la thaba kwa ntle ga kapoko** - The mountainside itself doesn't become the avalanche, but is where it occurs.
*   **D: Kapoko e tlogetswe e sa angwa ke batho** - While human activity can contribute, the text doesn’t directly state unattended snow becomes an avalanche.



"
"Go ya ka temana,kheri e dirilwe ka didiriswa dife?","The correct answer is **B: Ditlhatsana le dipaese**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Khari ke dijo tse di dirilweng ka **ditlhatsana le dipaese**, ga mmogo le nama kgotsa merogo."" (Khari is a dish made with **flour and fat**, sometimes with meat or vegetables.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yogurt le metsi** - Yogurt is *used in some* khari soups, but isn't a base ingredient. Water is mentioned for consistency, not as a primary ingredient.
*   **C: Mašwi a coconut le nama** - Coconut is used in *some* regional variations, but isn't a general ingredient.
*   **D: Merogo le mašwi** - Vegetables are *sometimes* added, but aren't a core ingredient.



"
"Mo dikgaolong tse dingwe, mašwi a coconut a dirisiwa, ka dinako dingwe, mo legatong la sediriswa se feng mo kharing?","The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mo mafelong a a kgakajana le lewatle kwa bokone jwa India le Pakistan, yogurt e dirisiwa mo di sopong tsa khari. Kwa borwa jwa India le mafelo a a fa lewatleng, go dirisiwa maswi a coconut thata.""

This directly translates to: ""In coastal areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curry soups. In southern India and other coastal areas, thick coconut milk is used.""

The question asks what coconut milk sometimes replaces. The text clearly indicates coconut milk is used *instead of* yogurt in certain regions.



"
Goreng go dikologa dithaba go tlhokega go ya kwa phitlhelelong?,"The correct answer is **D: E motlhofo go na le go tsamaya ka tsela ya Ross Sea**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ga se motsamo o o bonolo, se se raya gore tsela ya teng e dikologa dithaba go fitlhela ko phitlhelelong."" This directly implies the route goes *around* mountains because a direct route (potentially via the Ross Sea) is difficult or impractical.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seteišene sa McMurdo gantsi, se tswetswe:** The passage doesn't mention anything about McMurdo Station being frozen.
*   **B: Kapoko e e gatisitsweng e kotsi:** While the traverse is challenging, the passage doesn't say it's dangerous because of the printed route itself.
*   **C: Diterekere tse di kgethegileng ga di tsamaye bonolo:** The passage states the vehicles *can* travel the route, though it's challenging due to the terrain, not the vehicles themselves.



"
"Go bapa le South Pole Traverse (kgotsa Tselakgolo), ke eng se se tshwailweng ka difolaga?","The correct answer is **C: Diphatlha tse di katetsweng kapoko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ke kapoko e e gatisitsweng le **diphatlha tse di katetsweng** le go tshwaiwa ka difolaga."" This directly says that the *kapoko* (the traverse itself) is printed with and marked with flags that are flown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tsela kwa McMurdo Station** - This is the *starting point* of the traverse, not what's flown.
*   **B: Diterekere tse di gogang selei sa leokwane** - These are the *vehicles* that travel the route, not what's flown.
*   **D: Go dikologa mo go kotsi mo dithabeng** - This describes the *difficulty* of the route, not something flown.



"
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le sengwe se bajanala ba tshwanetseng go se ela tlhoko fa ba etela mo borwa jwa Aforika?,"The correct answer is **A: Melawana le madi a dipampiri tsa teseletso ya mosepele tsa Visa di farologana ka mafatshe.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically highlights that visa requirements and fees **vary by country** and are determined by the country you are a national of. This is a crucial detail for travelers to be aware of.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While true, the passage presents this as a *benefit* of driving, not a crucial thing to be aware of.
* **C:** The passage states that the Cape region *is* full of obstacles, but explicitly says **not all countries** are like that.
* **D:**  This discusses the *type* of vehicle needed for certain areas, not a general travel requirement.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka tsewang e le keletso e e sa siamang go bajanala ba ba batlang go tlhotlhomisa borwa jwa Aforika ka koloi?","The correct answer is **A: Lefatshe lengwe le lengwe le na le melao ya lone, ya gore ke didiriswa dife tse di bewang mo koloing, tse di tlhokegang mo maemong a tshoganyetso.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically warns travellers to research the requirements of each country regarding safety equipment in vehicles.** This is a critical piece of information for planning a road trip through Southern Africa. Ignoring this could lead to legal issues or being unprepared for emergencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage *mentions* 4x4s are helpful, it doesn't say they are *essential* for all travel. It states some places are only accessible with a high-clearance 4x4, but many areas can be reached with other vehicles driven carefully.
* **C:** The passage states travelling by car is *a good way* to reach less-travelled areas, not that it's the *only* way.
* **D:** The passage states the Cape region is full of mountains and isn’t like everywhere else, but doesn’t say it’s incorrect to explore Southern Africa by car.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e sa umakiwang mo temaneng e le kotsi e e ka tlisiwang ke gore o kgaogane le dibeke tsa gago?,"The correct answer is **C: Di ka tsewa gore ke tsa motho o mongwe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dibeke tse di sa tlhokomelwang di ke tsone tse di utswiwang"" (Unattended items are the ones that are stolen). It doesn't mention them being *mistaken* for someone else's.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text as risks:

* **A: Di ka utswiwa (They can be stolen):** This is directly stated in the passage.
* **B: O ka nna wa iphitlhela o dirisitswe go rwala ditagi o sa itse (You might find yourself accused of using tags you don't know about):** This is a key warning given in the first part of the text.
* **D: Baokamedi ba lefelo ba ka belaela, bogolo thata jang fa go kile ga nna le matshosetsi a dibomo (Local authorities can suspect you, especially if there have been bomb scares):** This is also directly stated, connecting unattended items to potential security concerns.



"
Ke eng se se sa umakiwang mo temaneng tebang le go rwala ditagi?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo mafatsheng a mangwe, e le la ntlha motho a dirile molato, kotlhao e kgona go nna loso.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically highlights the severe consequences (including the death penalty in some countries) for seemingly minor offenses like tagging, *especially* for first-time offenders. This is a point of significant concern raised in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ikele tlhoko thata fa o kgabaganya melolwane:** While the passage *mentions* being careful with information, it's not the main point of warning about the dangers.
* **C: Dintša tse di dirisiwang go dupa ditagi di ka nna tsa dirisiwa nako nngwe le nngwe ntle le tsiboso:** This is a detail about the tools used, but not the core warning about the potential severity of the punishment.
* **D: Baokamedi ba ka go amoga dibeke, le fa o sa tsamaise ditagi:** The passage states that unattended belongings *are* stolen, but doesn't say authorities will necessarily seize them. It warns *against* leaving belongings unattended.



"
"Ke mofuta ofe wa seno, o o sa umakiwang e le sengwe se o ka lekang go se dira kwa gae fa o na o le nosi?","The correct answer is **D: Tee**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions making tea with chamomile (""ka tee e e lapolosang ya chamomile bosigo"") and coffee (""Tlatsa legae la gago ka kofi""). It also suggests making juice or a smoothie. Matute (porridge) and biri (beer) aren't mentioned as options for making at home when you have extra time. The passage highlights the enjoyment of making and drinking tea when you have a moment to yourself.



"
"Ke dife tsa tse di latelang, tse o tshwanetseng o di etele fa o le nosi, fa toropo ya gago e itsege ka mokgwa wa yone wa go nwa bojalwa?","The correct answer is **C: Diphabo tse o sa yeng go tsone kgapetsa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Fa o nna mo toropong e e nang le mekgwa e e farologaneng ya go nwa bojalwa, ikele kwa bareng kgotsa phapo e e fa gaufi e o se keng o ya ko go yone kgapetsa.""  This directly suggests exploring *new* bars or pubs when you have free time in a city known for its drinking culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mabenkele a kofi kwa ntle ga toropo ya gago:** The passage focuses on enjoying coffee *at home* and doesn't mention traveling to coffee shops outside the city.
*   **B: Mabenkele a juse kgotsa smoothy:** While the passage mentions making juice or smoothies, it doesn't suggest going *to* shops to buy them.
*   **D: Mafelo a bojelo a titielang tee ya khemomaele:** The passage mentions enjoying chamomile tea but doesn't suggest seeking out places specifically for it.



"
Maphoi a a betlilweng a beilwe kae?,"The correct answer is **B: Mo jarateng ya kereke** (In the churchyard).

The passage specifically states: ""Go tsaya halofo ya ura go tsamaya tsamaya mo motseng ono o o kgatlhisang. Mo jarateng ya kereke, gona le maphoi a a kgatlhisang, a a betwileng ka mmabole, fa godimo ga mabitla a mangwe."" (It takes half an hour to walk around this interesting village. In the churchyard, there are interesting tombstones, decorated with pebbles, on top of other stones.)"
Ke mofuta ofe wa visa o o ka tlhokang gore mongwe a tlamele bopaki jwa tshegetso e e lekaneng ka madi?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ya go ithuta (Student Visa)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""o tla tshwanelwa ke go ntsa sesupo sa go re o na le madi a go ituelela sekolo le go itshetsa ngwaga wa ntlha wa sekolo.""  This directly refers to needing proof of sufficient funds, and this requirement is associated with a **student visa** (visa ya go ithuta) because students need to demonstrate they can financially support themselves while studying abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Visa ya kgwebo (Business Visa):**  This is for people travelling for business purposes, not students needing to prove financial support for education.
*   **B: Visa ya bojanala (Tourist Visa):**  While tourists might need to show some funds, it's not the primary focus like it is for students.
*   **C: Visa ya nakwana (Transit Visa):** This is for passing *through* a country, not staying to study.



"
"Ke mang, thata, yo a ka nnang a tlhoka Visa e e atolositsweng?","The correct answer is **C: Moithuti wa boditšhabatšhaba (International student)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...ga ntsi go tlhoka go re o nne lobaka lo lo leele koo go na le go ya teng fela e kete o mojanala. Ka kakaretso, fa o batla go nna mo lefatsheng le e seng la gaeno ka lobaka lo lo leele, o tla tshwanela ke go dira lekwalotetla la boagi nako e sale teng."" and ""...Tetlelelo ya baithuti go ya kwa dinageng tse dingwe e nale ditlhokego tse di farologaneng go tsa bajanala kgotsa bo-rrakgwebo...""

This means international students (moithuti wa boditšhabatšhaba) staying for an extended period for study *will* likely need a visa (lekwalotetla la boagi) more so than a regular tourist (mojanala) or business traveler (motsamai wa tsa kgwebo).



"
"O tshwanetse o tlhokomele menang neng, segolobogolo?","The correct answer is **B: Fa o haeka** (When you are showering).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka selemo, segolobogolo, o tla tshwanela go tlhokomela menang **fa o swetsa** ka go re o batla go haeka mo dikgweng tsa pula.""  This translates to ""Throughout the year, especially, you should pay attention to the water when you are showering because you want to bathe in the rain.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka dikgwedi tsa selemo** (Throughout the months of the year) - While mentioned generally, the specific timing is linked to showering.
* **C: Mo sekgweng sa pula** (In the rain shower) - The passage is *about* wanting to shower *like* it's raining, not actually being in the rain.
* **D: Fa o kgweetsa** (When you are sweating) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se o sa tshwanelang go se dira go tila menang fa o kgweetsa go ralala sekgwa sa pula?","The correct answer is **A: Go tlogela dikgoro tsa sejanaga di butswe sebaka** (Leaving the frog's doors open).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...metsotsonyana e se kae fela o butse dikgoro e lekane go re fa o tsena mo teng ga sejanaga o fitlhele menang e tsene mo teng ga sejanaga le wena."" This means you shouldn't leave the frog's doors open enough for the rain to get in *with* you.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go kgweetsa ka selemo** (To arrive in the summer) - The passage mentions summer, but doesn't say it's something you shouldn't do.
*   **C: Go kgweetsa go ralala mafelo a boboatsatsi** (To arrive at sunset) - The passage mentions sunset, but it's about *when* you arrive, not something to avoid.
*   **D: Go tlogela sejanaga se sa tlhokomelwa fa o haeka** (To leave the frog unattended when you settle) - The passage focuses on protecting yourself *from* the rain getting in with the frog, not neglecting the frog itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno ka Sundarbans tse e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Bontlhabongwe jwa yone bo apesitswe ke mafelo a loraga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sundarbans e bogolo jwa 3,850 km², mme mo e ka nnang nngwe-tharong ya yone e apesitswe ke mafelo a a metsi/loraga."" This translates to ""Sundarbans is 3,850 km² in size, and about one-third of it is covered by wet/marshy areas.""  Therefore, one-third is covered by marshy areas, *not* the majority.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Go na le mafelo a kileng a bo a aperwe ke dikgwa tse di tona, tse di kitlaneng, tse di tala** - The passage explicitly states this: ""go na le mafelo a kileng a bo a aperwe ke dikgwa tse di tona tse di kitlameng, tse di tala.""
*   **C: Ke sekgwa se se pataganeng sa ditlhare tsa mangrove tse di bapisitseng lewatle,se se di fetang tsotlhe mo lefatsheng** - The passage begins by stating this is true: ""Sundarbans ke sone sekgwa se se pataganeng sa ditlhare tsa mangrove tse di bapisitseng lewatle, se se di fetang tsotlhe mo lefatsheng.""
*   **D: Ke legae la diphala dintsi tse di bonweng foo, go feta dinkwe tsa Bengal** - The passage says there are an estimated 30,000 deer and 400 Bengal tigers, confirming more deer than tigers.



"
Ke karolo efe ya sekgwa e letseng mo nageng ya India?,"The correct answer is **A: Phaka ya bosetšhaba ya Sundarbans** (Sundarbans National Park).

The text specifically states: ""Lefelo la sekgwa se le le mo nageng ya India lebitswa Sundarbans National Park."" (The part of the mangrove forest that is in India is called Sundarbans National Park.)



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mang yo go ka fitlhelwang a na le , bonnye, go tlhaloganya mo go lekanyeditsweng, ga puo ya sejatlhapi go gaisa bangwe?","The correct answer is **B: Batho ba dingwaga tse di kwa tlase (Children)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""... *mme e bile go fitlhelwa thata go tlhoka kitso go ko tlase thata - bogolo jang thata mo bananeng.*""  This translates to ""... and it is often harder for those with less knowledge – especially for children."" 

This directly indicates that children have more difficulty understanding and speaking a foreign language well compared to others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Batho ba ba buang, bonnye, diteme tse dingwe tse pedi (People who speak a few other dialects):** The text doesn't suggest these people struggle more with language understanding.
*   **C: Batho ba ba tsayang mesepele go ya kwa Toronto (People traveling to Toronto):** The passage uses this as an example of people with different accents, not a group with inherent difficulty understanding languages.
*   **D: Batho ba dingwaga tse di kwa godimo (Older people):** The text specifically highlights the difficulty for *younger* people (children), not older ones.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se go ka nnang thata go se bitsa?","The correct answer is **B: Diaterese**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Go le ga ntsi go motlhofo go tlhaloganya mafoko a a kwadilweng botoka go na le a a buiwang. Go ntse jalo segolobogolo fa go tla mo **diatereseng** ka ga ntsi go le bokete go a bua sentle.""

This directly translates to: ""It is often easier to understand written words than spoken ones. This is especially true with **accents** as it is difficult to speak well.""

The passage highlights the difficulty in understanding *how* people say things (their accents - diaterese) rather than the words themselves (mafoko) or writing (mafoko a a kwadilweng).
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke seemo sefe se se ka siamelang mosepedi yo o ikaelelang go tshwara bese go tswa kwa seteišeneng sa dibese tse di tsamaelang ko dikgaolong di sele?","The correct answer is **A: Moeti o lebile Jakar mme o setse a rekile thekete pele**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""segolo jang tse di lebileng kwa bophirima le le Jakar/Bumthang di tswa magareng 06:30 le 07:30.""  This means buses to Jakar (and Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
* **The passage also states:** ""go botoka o reka thekethe ya bese malatsinyana pele o tsaya loeto."" This means it's best to buy a ticket in advance.

Option A reflects both of these points - a passenger going to Jakar *and* having already purchased a ticket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Bumthang is mentioned, there's no requirement to leave *exactly* at 7.
* **C:** The passage says buses to places like Paro are cheaper, but doesn't link it to a specific departure time or being after 11.
* **D:** The passage says buses to the west (like Jakar and Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30, not *before* 6:20. Also, it doesn't specify a direction of ""east.""



"
Ke eng seo e ka nnang keletso e e siameng go mojanala yo a batlang go ya botlhaba go tswa seteišeneng sa dibese tse di tsamaelang kwa dikgaolong di sele?,"The correct answer is **B: Reka thekete malatsinyana pele o tsaya loeto**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ka gore dibese tse di tsamaelang ko dikgaolong di sele di nna di tletse, go botoka o reka thekethe ya bese malatsinyana pele o tsaya loeto."" (Because buses traveling to remote areas are often full, it is advisable to buy a bus ticket the day before your trip.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dibese fela, di tloga morago ga 8:30** - The text says most buses leave between 06:30 and 07:30, and those to western and Jakar/Bumthang. There's no information about buses *only* leaving after 8:30.
*   **C: Dibese tse dintsi di tloga motshegare otlhe** - The text says buses to the areas mentioned leave early morning.
*   **D: Thekisi e e kopanelwang e ka nna mokgwa o botlhale wa go tsamaya** - While the text mentions shared taxis, it doesn’t position them as a particularly *smart* option - it just states their pricing. The most direct advice is to pre-book a bus ticket.



"
"Ke efe ya e latelang e e seng tlhaloso ka nepagalo, ya Timbuktu?","The correct answer is **C: Ga o kgone go e fitlhelela ka sefofane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...gape e na le boemafofane."" This directly contradicts option C, which claims you cannot reach Timbuktu by airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: E lebega Searabiya go na le se-Afrika, fa o bapisa le naga yotlhe** - The passage states: ""Toropo e farologane thata le ditoropo tse dingwe tsotlhe tsa naga e, ka e lebega se-Arabea go na le se-Afrika.""
*   **B: E humanegile** - The passage states: ""Gompieno, Timbuktu ke toropo e e humanegileng...""
*   **D: E itsege ka go nna kgogedi ya bajanala** - The passage states: ""...le fa e itsege ka go nna kgogedi ya bajanala...""



"
Ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang ka Timbuktu e e leng nnete?,"The correct answer is **C: E farologane thata le ditoropo tse dingwe tsa naga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Toropo e farologane thata le ditoropo tse dingwe tsotlhe tsa naga e, ka e lebega se-Arabea go na le se-Afrika."" (The town differs greatly from all other towns in the country, as it looks more Arabic than African.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toropo e a fitlhelelwa ka sefofane:** The passage says it *has* airports, but doesn't say it *is* known for them. It's known for being a desert oasis.
* **B: Go sa tlwaelege ga yone go feta go humanega:** The passage says it *is* inhabited (""toropo e e humanegileng"") but historically was *seen as* an inaccessible, remote place (""e setse e diriswa jaaka tshwantshiso ya dinaga tse di sa tlwaelegang"").  The current state is the opposite of its historical perception.
* **D: Ga e sa ngoka bajanala:** The passage specifically states it's ""itsege ka go nna kgogedi ya bajanala"" (known for being a desert oasis).



"
Diolimpiki tsa selemo di ne di rulaganyeditswe neng mo tshimologong? ,"The correct answer is **D: Phukwi 2020**.

The text states: ""...nako e e eng rulaganyeditswe metshameko ya di-Olympic."" (which translates to ""...the time the Olympic games were originally scheduled for."") and then mentions the rules around July 2020 and Coronavirus. This indicates Phukwi (July) 2020 was the original planned time.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke neng mo diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, di nnang kgwanyape?","The correct answer is **D: Morago ga go kgoma mmu** (After hitting the ground).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Di simolola pele e le diphatlhanyana tse di fologang go tswa mo marung a setsuatsue, *mme di bo di nna """"kgwanyape"""" fa di kgoma mmu*.""  This directly translates to ""They start as cool particles from storm clouds, *but become """"dust devils"""" when they hit the ground*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The speed (100km/h) is a characteristic of *kgwanyape* (dust devils), not what *causes* them to become *kgwanyape*.
* **B:** Low-pressure winds are a general condition, not the specific moment of transformation.
* **C:** Starting from storm clouds is where they *begin*, not where they *become* dust devils.



"
"Ke sefe sa tseno, se e leng sebopego ka nepagalo, sa kgwanyape?","The correct answer is **D: Ke go dikologa ga phefo ya kgatelelo e e ko tlase, e e kgapelang moya kwa ntle.**

Here's why:

* **The passage defines a tornado as a result of low-pressure air spiraling upwards.** This is the fundamental, core characteristic of a tornado – the swirling, upward motion of air.  The other options describe *effects* of a tornado (how fast the winds are, what it can lift, how it forms) but don't define *what it is*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Describes the *speed* of the winds, not the tornado itself.
* **B:** Describes *what a tornado does* (lifts debris), not its core nature.
* **C:** Describes *how a tornado forms*, but not its essential characteristic.



"
"Go ya ka temana,mojanala o tshwanetse a bone kgakololo go tswa kae tebang le seemo sa dipolotiki kwa toropong e a batlang go e etela?","The correct answer is **A: Go tswa pusong ya naga eo ba tla bong ba e etela** (From the government of the country they are going to visit).

Here's why:

The text states: ""O ne o ka batla go kopa le dithuso tsa puso eseng go ikemela ka nosi, mme dikgakololo tsa bone di lebagane le baagi ba bone."" This directly translates to wanting to seek help from the government (of the destination country) rather than relying on oneself, and that the government's advice is aligned with its citizens.  The passage implies that understanding the political climate requires guidance *from the government of the country you're visiting*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Go tswa megopolong e e tlhagisitsweng mo dikitsisong tsa mesepele** (From opinions expressed in travel forums) - The text specifically criticizes these opinions as superficial and lacking depth.
* **C: Go tswa ko baaging ba naga e ba tla bong ba e jela nala** (From the citizens of the country you are visiting) - While understanding citizens is helpful, the text prioritizes getting information *from the government*.
* **D: Go tswa kwa pusong ya bone** (From their own government) - The text implies the visitor needs to understand the *destination* country’s political landscape, not their own.



"
"Fa go na le dikitsiso tsa mosepele,ke eng se se ka nneng sa se diragalele motswantle?","The correct answer is **B: Tshoboko e e sa tsenelelang tebang le maemo a dipolotiki a lefatshe** (A superficial understanding in relation to the political situation of the world).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the observations are a ""tshoboko ya seemo sa diplotiki tsa lefatshe"" - a *superficial understanding* of the global political situation.  The whole point is that the comments are based on broad, potentially inaccurate generalizations about people based on their origin.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Inshorense ya go emisa loeto e a amega (Travel cancellation insurance is affected):** While the passage *mentions* travel insurance, it's as an example of something potentially affected by these issues, not the core problem itself.
* **C: Inshorense ya botsogo e a amega (Comprehensive insurance is affected):** Similar to A, this is a consequence *of* the problem, not the problem itself.
* **D: Tshedimosetso ka botlalo tebang le seemo sa polotiki sa naga (Full information in relation to the political situation of the country):** The passage actually argues *against* this – the observations are *not* based on full, informed understanding. They are superficial.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mofuta ofe wa leeto o o ka tswang o ka se tlhoke thuso ka peeletso go tswa kwa moemeding wa tsa mesepele?","The correct answer is **B: Leeto la dibeke tse pedi ka madi a a lekanyeditsweng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...badiredi le bantsi ba ke dikgeleke mo mefuteng e e rileng ya mosepele, madi a a lekanyeditsweng kgotsa mafelo a go jwang kwa go one."" This means that trips with pre-arranged budgets and itineraries (like a two-week trip with a fixed budget) are often handled by the employee directly and don't necessarily *require* a travel agent's detailed guidance.  The agent's expertise is most valuable when someone is exploring something new or unfamiliar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  A return visit to a familiar city still might benefit from updated information or suggestions.
* **C:** The passage explicitly states travel agents provide reminders about nature, culture, language – all things a traveler to a new country would want to know.
* **D:**  A first-time trip to a destination clearly needs the travel agent's support.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke mo seemong sefe mo mojanala a ka solegelwang molemo ke thuso ya moemedi wa tsa mesepele?","The correct answer is **B: Fa mojanala a na le kgatlhego go peeletso ya leeto le le kgethegileng lekgetlho la ntlha.**

Here's why:

The text states the guide ""gantsi o neela baeti dikgakololo tse di fetang maitemogelo a a fetileng a moeti ka ga tlhago, setso, puo kgotsa dinaga tsa lotseno."" This means the guide provides *extra* information beyond what the traveler already knows, especially about nature, culture, language, or specific destinations.  This is most helpful when someone is planning a trip focused on a particular interest for the first time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While a multi-destination trip *could* benefit from a guide, the text doesn't specifically mention this as the primary benefit.
* **C:** The ability to speak the language isn't highlighted as a situation where a guide is particularly useful.
* **D:**  The text doesn't suggest a guide is *needed* to appreciate cultural differences, just that they can provide additional insight.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka thusang mojanala go tila go swabisiwa fa a etela mafelo a maša?","The correct answer is **D: Tila go dira dipatlisiso pele ka bonno**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Se ke sengwe sa dilo tse o tshwanetseng wa nna o di gopotsa, go tila go swabisiwa kgotsa gongwe le e leng go tlhoa tsela ya selegae e go dirwang dilo ka yone."" This translates to ""One of the things you need to remember is to avoid being confused or doing things differently than the local way of doing things.""  Doing research beforehand (dipatlisiso pele) is the best way to prepare and avoid this confusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go solofela gore dilo di tla tshwana le kwa o tswang teng** - The passage *specifically* says to *expect* things to be different.
* **B: Go ikaelela go leka go ja dijo tse o tla bong o sa di tlwaela** - While trying new foods is good, it doesn't prevent confusion or cultural missteps.
* **C: Go latela melao e e tshwanang le ya mo o tswang teng** - The passage emphasizes that laws *will* be different; following your home country's laws could be problematic.



"
"Go ya ka tshedimosetso mo temaneng, ke mofuta ofe wa motho o a ka swabang fa a etela lefelo le lengwe?","The correct answer is **D: Mongwe yo o kgatlhegelang go ithuta (Someone who is interested in learning)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being aware that things will be *different* in a new place – customs, laws, food, manners, language, etc. It specifically warns against expecting things to be done the same way as ""back home"" and stresses the need to be open to how things are done locally. This points to a person who is willing to learn and adapt to new cultures and ways of life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mongwe yo o ratang dijo tse a sa di tlwaelang (Someone who likes unfamiliar food)** – While enjoying new foods is *part* of experiencing a new culture, the passage is about much more than just food.
*   **B: Mongwe yo o itumelelang phetogo (Someone who enjoys change)** – Enjoying change is helpful, but the passage focuses on *understanding* and *respecting* differences, not just enjoying the fact that things are different.
*   **C: Mongwe yo o sa fetoleng mogopolo (Someone who doesn’t change their mind)** – This is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates. The passage warns against sticking to your own way of doing things.



"
Ke sefe sa tse di latelang se o ka se eletseng mojanala yo o etelang naga e e tlhabologang la ntlha ka sone?,"The correct answer is **A: Itse diphologolo tsa lefelo le o le jetseng nala, pele o robala fa fatshe.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: *""O seka wa robala mo materaseng ha hatshe fatshe kwa mafelong a o sa itseng diphologolo tsa one.""* (Don't sleep on the ground in places where you don't know the animals.) This directly advises the traveler to be aware of the local wildlife *before* sleeping outdoors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the passage mentions enjoying luxuries like good food and service, it doesn't specifically advise spending a lot of money on food right away.
*   **C:** The passage *mentions* insect repellent, but doesn't present it as the primary or most important advice.
*   **D:** The passage mentions staying in high-end hotels, but it's presented as a way to adjust to the new environment, not a key piece of safety advice for someone exploring a new country.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e sa umakiwang e le sengwe se o ka se ntshetsang madi a a bonalang fa o itlwaetsa naga e nngwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Materase le mosamo tsa go kampa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically advises *against* sleeping on mattresses in unfamiliar places due to potentially dangerous animals. It also encourages bringing your *own* camping supplies like insect repellent.  Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as things you will find/experience while adapting to a new country (Western-style food, quality services, and high-end hotels).  

The passage warns you *not* to rely on having comfortable bedding readily available. Therefore, bringing your own camping mattress and sleeping bag is something you *should* prepare, not something you can easily obtain upon arrival."
Ke dife tsa ditlhopho tse di latelang tse di ka tshwanelang mong wa pholisi yo a batlang khopi ya pholisi fela a ka nna a se nne le inthanete?,"The correct answer is **C: Fa o tsamaya ka lepothopo kgotsa mogala wa letheka wa sefatlhego se se tona, boloka dikhopi mo memoring wa yone**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Fa o tsamaya ka lepothopo kgotsa mogala wa letheka wa sefatlhego se se tona, boloka dikhopi mo memoring wa yone kgotsa disike (e kgona go dirisiwa go se na inthanete).""  This directly addresses the situation of needing a copy of the policy *without* internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fa ba o tsamayang nabo meriti ya pholisi ya gago** - While sharing with travel companions is a good idea, it doesn't provide *you* with a copy when offline.
* **B: O ithomele meriti ya tsone ka imeili** - This requires internet access to retrieve the email.
* **D: Boloka khopi ya gago mo “cloud”** - This *absolutely* requires internet access.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang, se se sa tlhokeng go bontshiwa mo pholising?","The correct answer is **A: Dinomoro tsa boditšhabatšhaba tsa mogala go dira tleleimi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states you need to carry your policy details *and* contact information for your insurer. It then lists what information is needed to communicate with the insurer: **email address and phone numbers *external* to the insurance company**.  This means the passage is referring to phone numbers you would use to *reach* someone at the insurance company (e.g., a claims adjuster's direct line), not international numbers to make a simple call.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aterese ya imeili ya inšorense (Insurance email address):** The passage explicitly states you need the insurer's email address.
* **C: Dinomore tsa boditšhabatšhaba tsa mogala tsa ditetlelelo (International phone numbers for emergencies):** While not specifically mentioned as *required* on the policy itself, having these for emergencies is implied by needing contact info for assistance.
* **D: Aterese ya imeili ya mong wa pholisi (Policyholder's email address):** The passage mentions needing to provide an email address to *the insurer*, which implies the policyholder should have one as well.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke selekanyo sefe sa negative e e bontshang mofuta wa filimi o o tlwaetseng go dirisiwa?","The correct answer is **D: Negative ya 36 ka 24 mm**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Filimi tsa go tlwaelegatsa tsa 35 mm (ya negative ya 36 ka 24mm) ke tsone tse di itseweng thata."" This directly identifies 36 ka 24mm as the standard film negative size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Negative ya 6 ka 6 cm** - This is mentioned as a size used by medium format cameras, but not the *most common* film.
*   **B: Negative ya 56 ka 56 mm** - This is a conversion related to the 6cm x 6cm size, not a standard negative size itself.
*   **C: Negative ya 35 mm** - While it mentions 35mm film, it specifies the *size* of the negative is 36 ka 24mm.



"
"Ke efe ya mefuta e e latelang, e e farologaneng ya difilimi, e e neelanang ka resolushene e e sa tlhomamang fa e bapiswa le khamera ya gajaana ya dijithale , ya lense e le nngwe?","The correct answer is **A: Filimi ya dimilimitara di le 35**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Filimi tsa go tlwaelegatsa tsa 35 mm (ya negative ya 36 ka 24mm) ke tsone tse di itseweng thata. Gantsi e ka emisediwa motlhofo tota fa o ka felelwa, **mme e naya resolushene e e sa tlhomamang fa e bapisiwa le khamera ya ga jaana ya dijithale ya lense e le nngwe.**""

The other options are incorrect because the passage states the medium format cameras (6cm x 6cm or 56mm x 56mm) *have* a higher resolution than 35mm film.
"
"Go ya ka temana, ke efe ya tse di latelang e e tla nnang ya bofelo ya go simolola kgwebo ya go kwala ka mosepele?","The correct answer is **C: Itirele webosaete e e leng ya gago** (Create your own website).

Here's why:

The passage states the steps in order:

1.  Mastering skills on an established travel website.
2.  Marketing and promoting yourself online.
3.  *Then* creating your own website.

Therefore, creating your own website is the final step mentioned in the passage for starting a travel writing business."
"Fa o simolola kgwebo ya go kwala ka mesepele, ke bofe ba bokgoni jo bo latelang, bo o ka bo tokafatsang pele?","The correct answer is **C: Ipaakanyetsa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *first* important skill to develop when starting a freelance writing business is ""to build a presence on an established travel website.""  ""Ipaakanyetsa"" (establishing a presence/marketing yourself) is the direct translation of this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go bloga (Blogging):** While blogging can be *part* of establishing a presence, it's not the initial foundational skill mentioned.
* **B: Go rulaganya webosaete (Web design):**  The passage says you build your *own* website *after* establishing yourself elsewhere.
* **D: Tlhola webosaete (Developing a website):**  Again, this comes *after* establishing yourself on another platform.



"
Mathata a mala a bonwa ka tlwaelo mo maemong afe a bosa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mafelong a a tsididi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*jaaka malwetsi a mafatlha mo mafelong a a tsididi, malwetsi a mala a tlwaelesegile mo mafelong a a molelo...*""  This directly translates to ""...just as diseases of the heat are common in cold places, diseases of the gut are common in hot places...""

Therefore, gut problems (mala) are commonly found in cold places.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ka go bo o rakana le megare ya ko o tswang,masole a mmele wa gago a ka tswa a tiile kgatlhanong le eng?","The correct answer is **B: Megare ya selegae**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kwa gae, ka go bo o rakana le megare ya ko o tswang, masole a mmele wa ga go a ka tswa a tiile mo e ka go tsenyeng bolwetsi."" This directly translates to ""At home, because you are familiar with the germs of where you come from, the soldiers of your body may be strong against what enters to cause disease.""  

This means your body's defenses are likely built up against the **local germs (megare ya selegae)** you've been exposed to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mathata a mala (Intestinal problems):** While the passage discusses intestinal problems like Delhi Belly, it doesn't say your body is prepared for them. It says they are *more likely* when encountering new germs.
*   **C: Mathata a khemo (Chemical problems):** The passage focuses on biological issues (germs, bacteria), not chemical ones.
*   **D: Delhi Belly:** Delhi Belly is an example of a disease you might get when exposed to *new* germs, not something your body is prepared for.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e nang le molemo wa go tsamaya mo teng ga kgaolo ya Schengen?,"The correct answer is **B: Boloka madi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Schengen Area ""saves time, money and a lot of paperwork.""  Options A, C, and D are either incorrect or represent inconveniences *removed* by the Schengen Area, not benefits of traveling within it.  Saving money is a direct benefit mentioned in the text.



"
Ke eng seo se sa tlholeng se bonwa kwa lebitleng Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **B: Tlhogo ya setopo se se sentsweng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...o tla swabisiwa ke go nne go bonala tlhogo le magetla fela."" This means only the head and legs of the statue remain visible in the tomb. While legs are mentioned, **tlhogo (head)** is specifically stated as being visible, making it the most accurate answer to what is still seen in the tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokgabiso mongwe** - The text says the tomb has *few* decorations, not that one specific decoration remains.
*   **C: Magetla a setopo se se sentsweng** - While legs are mentioned, the question asks about what *is* seen, and the head is specifically emphasized.
*   **D: Dikhumo** - The text says the artifacts were removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. They are no longer in the tomb."
"Go ya ka temana, ke kae kwa Vancouver koo go ka se ngokeng bajanala ba ba se nang madi a le mantsi? ","The correct answer is **A: Setlhaketlhake sa Granville**.

Here's why:

The text states that Bowen Island is accessed by public ferries *from* Granville Island in Vancouver. This implies Granville Island is a starting point for a relatively affordable way to reach a desirable destination (Bowen Island).  The other options are either the destination itself (Bowen Island, Whistler) or a specific activity/location *on* Bowen Island (the hiking trail).

The question asks where someone without much money can go, and the text suggests Granville Island provides access to Bowen Island via public (and therefore likely cheaper) ferries."
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe, le le ka neelang bajanala, maitemogelo a mmatota a Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Setlhaketlhake sa Bowen**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Batho bano ba reetsang ka kelotlhoko ba fitlhelwa **kwa Howe Sound ka fa ntle fela ga Vancouver, mme go motlhofo go e etela ka dipalamo tsa sechaba tsa mo metsing tse di tswang kwa Setlhaketlhakeng sa Granville mo toropokgolong ya Vancouver**."" This clearly indicates Bowen Island is accessible by ferry from Granville Island and offers a getaway near Vancouver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Whistler:** The text mentions Whistler, but describes it as further away (""sekgala sa ura le sephatlo o kgweetsa go tswa kwa Vancouver"") and is known for skiing, not as a quick getaway option.
*   **C: Bogareng ba Vancouver:** The text is about locations *outside* of Vancouver for an escape.
*   **D: Setlhaketlhake sa Granville:** Granville Island is where you *depart from* to get to Bowen Island, it is not the destination itself.



"
"Go ya ka temana, bajanala ba tshwanetse ba etele neng Diphororo fa ba batla go bona ba sa kgoreletsege?","The correct answer is **D: Fa e se setlha sa dipula**.

Here's why:

The text states that the water level is highest *during* the rainy season (Ngwanatsele to Mopitlwe). It also warns that during this time, the spray is very strong and can obscure the view of the falls. Therefore, to see the falls *less* obscured, you should visit **outside** of the rainy season.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke molemo wa eng o o bonwang ka go etela Diphororo tsa Victoria magareng ga Ngwanatsele le Mopitlwe?","The correct answer is **A: Ditebo tse di sa kgorelediweng tsa Diphororo** (Unparalleled views of the Falls).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mo pakeng ya dipula (Ngwanatsele go fitlha Mopitlwe), seelo sa metsi se ya kwa godimo mme diphororo di boitshega thata."" This directly translates to ""During the rainy season (November to April), the water level rises and the falls are at their most spectacular.""  The passage emphasizes the *intensity* and *beauty* of the falls during this time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bajanala ba palo e e kwa tlase** (Fewer tourists): The passage doesn't mention a decrease in tourists, it focuses on the spectacle of the falls.
* **C: Go leba go ntse go diragala tse dingwe tse di ngokelang** (Potential dangers): While the passage warns of getting wet, it doesn't present this as a benefit, but rather a possibility.
* **D: Go tila setlha sa dipula** (To escape the rainy season): The passage is *about* the falls *during* the rainy season, not escaping it.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke sefe sa tse di latelang se se sa kgothaletsweng fa o dirisa drone go gatisa filimi?","The correct answer is **D: Go gatisa filimi mo go tletseng batho moo drone e ka se lemogweng**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Go fofisa drone gaufi le boemafofane kgotsa mo godimo ga batho ba le bantsi ke kakanyo e e sa siamang ka metlha..."" (Flying a drone near airports or over large crowds of people is always a bad idea...). This directly discourages filming over large groups of people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tlhola pele gore o letleletswe go gatisa eng** (Check first what you are allowed to film) - The text encourages researching permissions (""Go dirisa drone, o batlisise pele ga nako gore ke eng se o letelelwang go se kapa..."").
*   **B: Go bona ditlankana tse dingwe tsa tetlelelo** (Seeing other angles of the video) - This isn't mentioned as being discouraged.
*   **C: Makwalo a tetlelelo ya go batlisisa** (Scripts for thorough investigation) - The text refers to researching what you are allowed to film, which could involve a script or plan, but doesn't discourage it.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke kae mo go siametseng go gatisa filimi ka tiriso ya drone?","The correct answer is **B: Mo mafelong a go tsaya ditshwantsho go go tlwaelegileng go sa letlelelwang.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Fa e le go re go tsaya senepe fela ga go a letlelelwa, hee ga wa tshwanela go akanya go re bidio yone o ka e rekote."" This means taking photos is often restricted, and implies that filming with a drone in those same restricted areas is also not allowed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage specifically warns *against* flying near large groups of people.
*   **C:** The passage doesn’t mention trying to hide the drone.
*   **D:** The passage doesn’t offer any advice on scouting locations based on previous filming.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke polelo efe tebang le ditlhokego fa o ikwadisetsa setlankana sa go etela naga e nngwe e seng nnete?","The correct answer is **B: Dinaga tsotlhe di tlhoka ikwadiso kwa balaoding ba selegae**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kwa dinageng tse dingwe..."" (In some countries...) and ""Mo dinageng tse di ntsi..."" (In many countries...). This clearly indicates that *not all* countries require registration with local police.
* **The passage specifically mentions:** ""...ba ba nnang kwa ntle ga mafelo a bojanala ke bone fela ba ba tshwanetseng go ikwala."" (Those who live outside the registration areas are the only ones who need to register). This further proves that registration isn't universal.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Fa o nna mo mafelong a bajanala, o ka nne wa se tlhoke go ikwadisa** - This is true, as the passage states only those *outside* registration areas need to register.
* **C: Se se ka nne sa batla gore o etele ba lephata la tsa mesepele** - The passage says this is a possibility in some countries.
* **D: Mo dinageng tse dingwe, dihotele tsa selegae ke tsone tse di dirang ikwadiso** - The passage confirms this happens in some countries.



"
Ke efe ya tse di latelang e e seng lefelo le mojanala a ka yang go dira ikwadiso?,"The correct answer is **C: Kantoro ya selegae ya poso**.

Here's why:

The passage states that registration typically happens at:

*   Local police stations
*   Immigration departments
*   Hotels (in many places)

It *doesn't* mention post offices as a place for registration. Therefore, a post office is the one that doesn't fit the described locations for registration.



"
Ke mang a ka se ungwelweng ka go ithaopa o le maetong?,"The correct answer is **D: Mongwe yo o ka kgatlhegelang bonno le boroko** (Someone who is interested in adventure and travel).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that being an expatriate (ithaopa) can offer adventure and the opportunity to experience different cultures. Options A, B, and C all align with benefits *of* being an expatriate mentioned in the text:

* **A:** Making new friends (kopana le batho ba basha)
* **B:** Earning money (somarela madi)
* **C:** Learning new skills (ithuta bokgoni jo bosha)

However, someone *interested* in adventure and travel is a *reason* to become an expatriate, not a characteristic of someone who *shouldn't* be. The passage doesn't suggest anyone would be unsuitable based on a desire for adventure. Therefore, option D is the most logical answer.



"
"Go ya ka temana,go ithaopa o le kwa moseja, go ungwela jang mojanala yo o se nang madi a mantsi?","The correct answer is **C: Go neelanwa ka lefelo la bonno le boroko ka dinako dingwe**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""... *go ka nna tsela ya go somarela madi, go nna kwa lefelong le le lengwe lobaka lo le leele ka go nne ditiro tsa baithaopi ka bontsi di fa boroko e bile tse dingwe di kgona go duela dikatsonyana.*"" 

This translates to ""...it can be a way to earn money, staying in another place for a long time by doing jobs for travelers, many of which are for food and some can earn small amounts of money."" This directly supports the idea that working abroad can sometimes involve being provided with accommodation and food in exchange for work, especially for those without much money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Madi a tuelo a tlamelwa** - While earning money is mentioned, the passage doesn't emphasize *significant* earnings.
*   **B: Go le gantsi, e felela e le ditšhono tsa ditiro** - The passage doesn't say it *always* results in work opportunities.
*   **D: E ka go thusa go leba dilo ka tsela e e farologanyeng** - This is a benefit of traveling abroad mentioned, but it doesn't answer the question about how it helps someone *without* money.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke eng se se ka tsewang e le leeto le le tlwaelesegileng la go ya Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Go nna leeto lotlhe ntle le go tswa kwa dikagong tsa Disney**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka tlwaelo leeto le akaretsa...go nna sebaka sa beke ntle le go tswa kwa dikagong tsa Disney...""  This means a typical trip involves spending the entire week *inside* the Disney parks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go nna beke ntle le go tswa kwa dikagong tsa Disney** - This is part of the description, but doesn't capture the whole typical trip.
*   **B: Go nna hoteleng e e kwa ntle ga kago** - The text doesn't say anything about staying outside the park.
*   **D: Palama bese go tswa boemafofaneng, go ya hoteleng** - This is just the beginning of the trip, not the whole typical experience.



"
Ke dife tsa dipolelo tseno ka Walt Disney World tse e seng nnete?,"The correct answer is **A: Dithekete tse di ka dirisiwang gantsi di a amogangwa le bajanala** (Used tickets are transferable).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""dithekete ga di amoganwe"" (tickets are non-transferable). This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are potentially true (or not addressed in the text):

*   **B: Go na le lefelo la bonno mo dikagong** (There is a secret area in the parks) - The passage doesn't mention this, so we can't determine if it's true or false.
*   **C: Go na le dibese tse di leng gone, go tsamaisa bajanala go tswa kwa lefelong la difofane, go ya kwa kagong** (There are buses that transport people from the airport to the park) - The passage mentions taking a bus from the airport to the Disney hotel, which implies transportation to the parks.
*   **D: Dithekete tse di ka diriswang gantsi, di ka bonwa gantsi mo diwebosaeteng tsa palabalo** (Used tickets are often found on online marketplaces) - The passage confirms this: ""Dithekete tse dintsi di rekisitswe ka diwebosaete tsa palabalo jaaka eBay kgotsa Craiglist ke tse di ka dirisiwang gantsi..."" (Many used tickets are sold on websites like eBay or Craigslist).



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dintlha tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya se nne gone mo dithutong tsa ikatiso ka fa tshwanelong kgotsa dibuka le dimakasine?","The correct answer is **A: Go iphemela mo sekgweng** (Surviving in the wilderness).

Here's why:

The text states: *""Dibuka le dimakasine tse di buang ka go iphemela mo sekgweng di dintsi...""* (There are many books and magazines that talk about surviving in the wilderness...). This directly indicates that wilderness survival is a topic covered in resources related to preparation for hostile environments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Go ipaakanyetsa thusopotlako** (Preparing for negotiation) - The text doesn't mention anything about negotiation skills.
*   **C: Go itshiamisetsa lefelo la ntwa** (Familiarizing oneself with the war zone) - While the course prepares you for hostile environments (which *could* include war zones), the text doesn't specifically say it focuses on detailed knowledge of war zones. It mentions general awareness.
*   **D: Diketšhe** (Exercises) - While the course *includes* exercises (""dikeche""), it's not a topic *covered* in books and magazines as the question asks.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke efe ya dithuto tse di latelang, e e ka nneng ya rutwa thata mo ikatiso ka fa tshwanelong?","The correct answer is **C: Go iphemela mo sekgweng** (Surviving in the wilderness).

Here's why:

The passage states: *""Dibuka le dimakasine tse di buang ka go iphemela mo sekgweng di dintsi, fa tse di buang ka mafelo a ntwa di le boutsana.""* (There are many books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness, but few about war zones). This indicates that wilderness survival is a significant component of the training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dithuso tsa potlako** (First aid) - While the passage mentions ""kitso e e tseneletseng ka dithuso tsa ntlha"" (thorough knowledge of first aid), it doesn't say this is the *primary* or most emphasized aspect of the training.
*   **B: Mafelo a ntwa** (War zones) - The passage specifically says information on war zones is *scarce* (""le boutsana"").
*   **D: Lefatshe le kwa go lone go tsogileng ntwa** (The country where the war originated) - The passage only mentions this as the *destination*, not as something you'd be taught *in* the training.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke tlhopho efe e e di gaisang,e o ka tilang metsi a a ka tswang a tlhoka go phephafadiwa ka yone?","The correct answer is **B: Reka metsi a lebotlolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...fa o na le tlhobaelo, o tla tshwanelwa ke go reka metsi a gago mo lebotloleng le le tswalegileng sentle gotswa kwa khampaning e e tshepagalang.""  This directly translates to ""...if you have concerns, you should buy your water in a well-sealed bottle from a reputable company."" This is presented as the solution when you are unsure about water quality and the need for purification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bedisa metsi metsotso e le mmalwa:** The passage says this *might* be enough in some places, but not all. It doesn't suggest it as a guaranteed solution for potentially contaminated water.
*   **C: Bedisa metsi motsotso o le mongwe:** Similar to A, this is mentioned as a possibility but not a reliable fix for all situations.
*   **D: Tlhatlhoba metsi gore a ga a na matshosetsi a a kgethegileng:** While identifying contaminants is important, the passage doesn’t suggest *how* to do this. It steers you towards a safer, simpler solution – bottled water – if you are concerned.



"
"Go ya ka temana, ke eng se se ka batlang se sa kgonagale le fa o le mothumi yo o nang le bokgoni?","The correct answer is **C: Go thuma ba itepatepanya le makhubu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Batho ba le bantsi ba latlhegelwa ke botshelo ba sena go tlhaela ba leka go thuma ba itepatepanya le makhubu go mo go le ga ntsi go sa kgonegeng."" (Many people lose their lives trying to swim against the currents near the reef, which is impossible.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go thuma gaufi le matlapa a fitlhelwang mo lewatleng:** While dangerous, the passage doesn't say it's *impossible* to swim near reefs. It states the currents near them are very strong.
*   **B: Go thuma mo metsing a a boteng:**  Strong currents are mentioned, but the passage doesn't declare swimming in them impossible, only that it's very difficult.
*   **D: Thuma go dikologa makhubu:** The passage doesn't discuss attempting to swim *around* the currents, only *against* them.



"
O tshwanetse go dira eng fa o le mo metsing a a elelang ka lebelo?,"The correct answer is **A: Leka go tswa mo makhubung ka go leba letlhakoreng le lengwe, o bo o thuma jaaka gale, o boela kwa lotshitshing.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Fela fa o sena go tswa mo metsing a a elelang ka lebelo, go thuma o boela ko o go tswang ke mo nka o thuma jaaka gale.""  This means if you're caught in a rip current, try to swim *parallel* to the shore (leba letlhakoreng le lengwe) and then swim back to shore (o boela kwa lotshitshing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Thumela ka bonako kgatlhanong le makhubu:** Swimming directly against a rip current is exhausting and ineffective. The passage warns against this.
* **C: Thuma o lebile tsela e e farologaneng:** This doesn't provide a specific, safe direction.
* **D: Thumela kwa boteng:**  The passage states rip currents are often *in* areas of breaking waves and can be very dangerous. Swimming towards breaking waves is risky.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke lefelo lefe le go etela ntlo ya bogosi, e le leeto la tlosobodutu, go ka ntswelang molemo?","The correct answer is **C: Mo mokgatšheng wa Rhine**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions visiting castles in the Loire Valley **and** the Rhine Valley as examples of good places to explore for a scenic getaway. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Toropo e e gaufi le Danube:** While the Danube is mentioned as a place with interesting cities, the passage doesn't specifically link it to castle visits.
*   **B: Gaufi le kanala ya Erie:** The Erie Canal is mentioned for boat trips and cycling, not castles.
*   **D: Gaufi le dinokana tsa metsi a elelang mo bogareng jwa naga:** This is a general statement in the beginning, not a specific location mentioned for castle visits.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke sefe sa tse di latelang se o ka se eletseng basadi ba ba tsamayang mo lefelong le, go se dira?","The correct answer is **B: Lemoga gore go farologana ga dingwao go ka nne ga rotloetsa maitsholo a e ka reng o a tlhekefadiwa go tswa kwa baaging ba selegae.**

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Basadi ba tshwanetse go lemoga go re go farologana ga dingwao go ka dira go re ba bone se e kareng ba tlhekefadiwa..."" (Women should recognize that differences in signs can make it seem like they are being deceived by locals). This directly advises women to be aware of potential deception due to cultural differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O seke wa tlotla ka maemo a gago a lenyalo** (Don't be proud of your marital status) - The text actually mentions being *targeted* based on marital status (""Go rotloediwa go re baeti bape ba basadi ba re ba nyetswe, go sa kgathalesege seemo sa bone sa mmatota sa lenyalo"").
*   **C: Se rwale palamonwana e e lebegang e le tlhwatlhwa e e kwa godimo thata** (Don't wear a very high heel shoe) - The text says it's okay to wear a small heel, just not a very high one.
*   **D: Dirisa bopopota fa go tlhokega** (Use anger when needed) - While the text encourages self-reliance, it doesn't specifically advise using anger. It promotes standing up to men without fear, and being independent.



"
"Go ya ka lefelo le le tlhalositsweng mo temaneng,o ka eletsa bajanala ba basadi jang?","The correct answer is **A: Lemoga gore ga go a tlwaelega go salwa morago**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""go tlwaelesegile go salwa morago"" (it is common to be left behind) and emphasizes that women should recognize this can happen and isn't right. This directly addresses a potential experience for women traveling in the described region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rwala palamonwana e kgolo go supa gore o nyetswe:** The passage mentions wearing a headscarf, but specifically states it *shouldn't* be one that’s overly noticeable. It’s a subtle suggestion, not a prominent display of marital status.
* **C: Tlhaloganya gore pharologano ya ditso e tsitsinya gore o tile go ikemela:**  The passage encourages independence *despite* cultural differences, not accepting limitations *because* of them.
* **D: Tlhomama fa o gana banna, mme o ikemele, fa ba go kopa lerato:** While the passage supports standing up to men, it’s in the broader context of self-reliance and not specifically about refusing romantic advances.



"
"Go ya ka temana,ke seemo sefe se se ka tlhokang gore motsayaditshwantsho wa diphologolo a dirise lense ya taolabogolo, e telele?","The correct answer is **A: Fa ba tshwantsha,segolobogolo,ditshedi tse di nnye** (When photographing, especially, small birds).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go tsaya ditshwantsho tsa diphologolo tsa naga go tlhoka lense ya taolabogolo e telele; fela dilo di tshwana le letsomane la dinonyane kgotsa setshedi se se nnye se tlhoka lense tse dingwe.""  This directly translates to: ""Taking pictures of wildlife requires a long telephoto lens; but things like a bird's nest or a small flower require other lenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text mentions commercial reasons *can* affect photography, but doesn't say a telephoto lens is *required* for commercial shoots.
* **C:**  The text says animals might be in the trees or on the ground, but doesn't link that to needing a telephoto lens.
* **D:** The text states parks *might* have rules, but doesn't say that necessitates a telephoto lens.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang e ka nna kgwetlho go batsayaditshwantsho ba diphologolo?","The correct answer is **B: Diphologolo tse di tlhaga di na le dikgoka.**

Here's why:

The passage states that wild animals *can* have horns or antlers. This is a simple fact *about* the animals. It doesn't present a challenge or skill needed *by* a wildlife photographer. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Go bona diphologolo tse dingwe tse di sa tlwaelegang** - The passage explicitly says it's *difficult* to see rare animals - a challenge for a photographer.
* **C: Go bona mofuta wa lense o o tlhokegang** - The passage details needing different lenses for different subjects (long lenses for distant animals, others for small details) - a crucial skill.
* **D: Go dira mo seemong se se tletseng letlhoo** - The passage states conditions can be muddy, foggy, or filled with vegetation - a challenge the photographer must deal with.

Therefore, only the fact that animals *may* have horns/antlers doesn't represent a skill or challenge for a wildlife photographer – it's just a characteristic of the subject.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e ka bakang mathata a a seng mantsi go mokgweetsi yo a tsamayang go ralala dithaba?","The correct answer is **C: Go wa ga marothodi ka bontsi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Go bona go ka kgoreletsega ka go wa kgotsa go bodulwa ga semathana kgotsa ka **marothodi a pula** kgotsa serame mo matlhabaphefong a sejanaga."" This means heavy rainfall (marothodi a pula) can worsen visibility and make driving dangerous in mountainous areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bokete jwa dikoloi** - The passage says traffic volume is consistent year-round, so it doesn't *cause* significant problems.
*   **B: Ga a kgone go itsetsepela** - This refers to tires losing traction on icy roads, a general hazard but not specific to mountainous regions.
*   **D: Go bona mo go kgoreletsegileng** - While reduced visibility is mentioned as a consequence, the *cause* of the problem is things *reducing* visibility (like heavy rain), not the visibility itself.



"
Ke eng se se ka nnang sa se fetoge ka lekgetho la letseno go ralala dinaga tse di farologaneng?,"The correct answer is **D: Seelo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lekgetho la ”income tax” le agilwe ka ditsela tse di farologaneng mo dinageng tse di farologaneng, **mme seelo sa lotseno le dituelo (tax bracket) di farologana thata go tswa mo nageng e nngwe go ya kwa go e nngwe.**""  This directly means the *rate* (seelo) is what changes between countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dikelo:** ""Dikelo"" translates to ""rates"" which is close, but ""seelo"" is the more specific and relevant term used in the passage when discussing tax rates.
*   **B: Le agilwe:** ""Le agilwe"" means ""it is built"" - this refers to *how* taxes are structured, not the rates themselves.
*   **C: Koo o kwadisang teng:** ""Koo o kwadisang teng"" means ""where you register"" - this is about location, not the tax rate.



"
"Go ya ka temana , fa o dira kwa moseja, mme o nna golo gongwe, ke kae moo o ka nneng wa kwadisa lekgetho la letseno teng?","The correct answer is **C: mo nageng e o dirang go yone gajaana** (in the country you are working in).

Here's why:

The passage states that when you work abroad, you will likely need to ""kwadisa lekgetho la letseno kwa nageng e o tswang kwa go yone"" (pay income tax in the country you come from). This means you are still liable for taxes in your home country even while working elsewhere. However, it also implies you may have tax obligations in the *country where you are working*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gongwe le gongwe ko o nnang teng ka gale** (Wherever you lived before): This is irrelevant to the current situation of working abroad.
*   **B: Mo Dinageng tse di Kopaneng** (In the United States): The passage uses the US and Canada as *examples* of federal systems, but doesn’t state you’ll pay taxes *specifically* there.
*   **D: Gongwe le gongwe koo dituelo di leng kwa tlase teng** (Wherever taxes are lower): While people often seek ways to minimize taxes, the passage doesn't suggest this is the primary obligation. It focuses on where you *must* pay taxes based on your work location and origin.



"
"Ke efe ya dipolelo tse di latelang, e e sa tlhaloseng ka nepagalo, Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe?","The correct answer is **D: Dinaga ga di tlhoke go tsaya karolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that countries *do* participate by creating pavilions and displays, demonstrating innovations and cultures. It says ""Dinaga di dira ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto mo pavilion ya naga..."" This directly contradicts the statement that countries are not required to participate.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Dipontsho di ka nne tsa bontsha ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo ditsong tsa one** - The text explicitly states this: ""...go supa dikgwetlho tsa lefatshe, le ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo ditsong tsa one.""
*   **B: Dipontsho tsa temo di diriwa gammogo le ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto** - The text describes both World Expositions (botaki and education) and International Horticultural Exhibitions (farming), suggesting they are related events within the broader scope of global exhibitions.
*   **C: Meletlo e ka tsaya dikgwedi di le thataro** - The passage says: ""...moletlo eno gantsi e tsaya lobaka lwa dikgwedi tse tharo go fitlha go tse thataro...""



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e leng molawana wa Dipontsho tsa Lefatshe kgotsa Dipontsho tsa Bodichabachaba ?","The correct answer is **A: Ditshupetso di tshwanetse go supa ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo nageng gammogo le dikgwetlho tsa lefatshe.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dinaga di dira ditshupetso tsa botaki le dithuto mo pavilion ya naga, go supa **dikgwetlho tsa lefatshe, le ka fa dilo di dirwang ka teng mo ditsong tsa one**."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says expos *generally* last three months, but doesn't state they *must*. It also states that they don't happen every year.
* **C:** The passage says the events *typically* take 3-6 months, not that they *must* be exactly three months.
* **D:** The passage doesn't state that *all* countries must participate.



"
"Go dira dife tsa tse di latelang, go ka batla go fokotsa kgonagalo ya tlhaselo ka diphologolo?","The correct answer is **D: Ba seka ba di di fa dijo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**ka jalo batho ba seka ba difa dijo kgotsa badi tshwenya**"" (so people should not feed them or bother them).  Feeding animals habituates them to humans and makes them more likely to approach and potentially attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Go tshola dijtlhatshana tse di nang le monkgo** (Throwing food with scent) - The passage *warns against* throwing or leaving scented food, as it attracts animals.
*   **B: Go tlosa matlakala mo kampeng** (Removing trash from the campsite) - While good practice for general cleanliness, the passage specifically focuses on food scents and distances.
*   **C: Go tshola sekgala sa dijarata di le 25 go tswa kwa diphiring** (Throwing food 25 yards from the fence) - This *increases* the risk, as it still provides food and attracts animals closer to the camping area.



"
"Ke efe ya tse di latelang, e e sa umakiwang mo temaneng jaaka se se ka bakang ditlhaselo ka diphologolo tsa naga","The correct answer is **D: Diphologolo tse di sa tlwaelang batho**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that animals *accustomed* to seeing people (diphologolo di tlwaetse go bona batho) are less likely to be a problem. It warns that even animals that *seem* docile (like deer, elk, bears) *can* attack. Therefore, the passage doesn't identify unfamiliarity with humans as a cause for attacks – quite the opposite, it suggests familiarity reduces risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Menkgo e e bogale (Strong smells):** The passage directly warns against throwing or leaving smelly food to avoid attracting animals.
*   **B: Go retelelwa ke go emela kgakala le tsone (Failing to keep a distance):** The passage says you should ""stand far away from them"" (go emela kgakala le tsone).
*   **C: Go fepa diphologolo tsa naga (Feeding wildlife):**  The passage specifically says ""people should not feed them"" (batho ba seka ba difa dijo).
