"Ko marãnduhai he’iháicha, mbaʼépa noñekonsidéramoʼãi peteĩ konsého oñembopu porã hag̃ua pe acordeón?","The correct answer is **D: Ejopy pya'eve pe fuelle ikatu hag̃uáicha ipu hatãve**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Acordeón-pe, oñembopu hatãve hag̃ua ojejopy hatã térã pya’eve fuelle."" (On the accordion, to make it sound good, you push or pull the bellows/fuelle.)  This directly relates to how to properly play the accordion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hatãve ipu hag̃ua, hatãve avei ejopyva’erã umi tecla:** While pressing keys is involved, the passage highlights the *bellows* as crucial for sound production.
* **B: Ani eñemongu'eparei ikatu hag̃uáicha nekyre'ỹve:** This relates to not getting tired while practicing, a general tip, not a core element of playing the accordion well.
* **C: Epove aja umi nota eñeha'ã topytu'u nde po:** This refers to knowing the notes well, which is important for *any* instrument, not specific to the accordion's functioning.

"Embopu aja acordeón, mávapa koʼãva apytégui neipytyvõta ipu hag̃ua hatãve?","The correct answer is **B: Hatãve ejopy**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How does one make a sound on an accordion, according to the text?
* **The text states:** ""Acordeón-pe, oñembopu hatãve hag̃ua ojejopy hatã térã pya’eve fuelle.""  This translates to ""On the accordion, to make a sound, you either push or pull the bellows.""
* **""Hatãve ejopy""** means ""push the bellows"" which is directly stated in the text as a way to produce sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pya'eve:** Means ""pull"" - while pulling *also* makes a sound, the text mentions *both* pushing *and* pulling.
* **C: Mbegueve ejopy:** Means ""don't push"" - this is the opposite of what the text says.
* **D: Sa'ive emongu'e ne kuã:** Means ""don't strain your mouth"" - this refers to singing, not playing the accordion.

Mba'ére umi ta'ãnga ryrýi oĩva ta'ãngambyrype oñeikytĩ ijerepe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojehecha porã hag̃ua umi taíkuéra (To see the images better)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the ""ta'anga ryrýi"" (extra features/content) are included ""hina ikatuhag̃uáicha pe ta'anga ryrýi ojagarrapa pe pantalla"" (so that the extra features can be displayed on the screen) and relates this to making it easier to see the ""taíkuéra"" (images/people in the video).  The whole point is to improve the viewing experience of what's *in* the video.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Upéicharõ pe ta'ãnga ryrýi omyenyhẽ pe ta'ãngambyry (So the extra features introduce the video):** The passage doesn't suggest the features *introduce* the video, but rather *enhance* it.
* **C: Oñemoambue hag̃ua ambue formato-pe (To change it to another format):** The text doesn't mention anything about changing formats.
* **D: Oikytĩ hag̃ua umi tai hi’aguĩetereíva iguygui (To hide the unwanted images):** The passage is about *seeing* things better, not hiding them.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávapa ha'e mba'e hasyvéva ikatu ojetopa embohasa hag̃ua ta'ãngamýi DVD-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ ta'ãnga omyenyhẽva pe ta'ãngambyry** (A system that hides the soundtrack).

Here's why:

The passage describes a method to embed subtitles *into* the video itself, essentially ""hiding"" the separate soundtrack (which would normally carry the subtitles).  The description focuses on how the subtitles are integrated into the visual information of the DVD, rather than being a separate track.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ ta'ãnga nomyenyhẽiva pe ta'ãngambyry** (A system that doesn't hide the soundtrack) - This is the opposite of what the text describes.
* **B: Tai oñeikytĩva mbytépe** (Those who are inserted inside) - This is too vague and doesn't describe the *method* of embedding.
* **D: Opaha oñeikytĩva** (All those who are inserted) -  Again, too vague and doesn't explain *how* it's done.



"
Moõ tepa guarnición británica oĩva’ekue?,"The correct answer is **B: Trenton-pe**.

The text states: ""General Cadwalde opoíta kuri peteĩ ataque oporombotavýtava **guarnición británica rovaque**, ohapejoko haguã refuerzo-kuéra."" This means General Cadwalde launched an attack against the British garrison *in* Trenton.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Assunpink Creek-pe:** While the militia fought *near* Assunpink Creek, the garrison itself was in Trenton.
*   **C: Bordentown-pe:**  Bordentown isn't mentioned in connection to the garrison.
*   **D: Princeton-pe:** Princeton isn't mentioned in connection to the garrison.



"
Máva teraguapy osẽ pe manuscrito borrado-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ko'ágã ojeikuaáva """"Dunlap andanada-ramo"""""". This translates to ""known as the """"Dunlap broadside"""".  A ""broadside"" is a single sheet printed with text, and the text specifically identifies Dunlap as the printer of these copies of the Declaration of Independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: George Washington:** He *received* a copy, but didn't print the manuscript.
*   **C: John Nixon:** He read the Declaration publicly, but didn't print the manuscript.
*   **D: Charles Thomson:** He was a secretary to Congress and helped with the manuscript, but Dunlap did the printing.



"
"Ko'ã tenda apytégui, moõpa og̃uahẽ ipahaitépe peteĩ andanada Dunlap-pegua?","The correct answer is **A: Nueva York-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peteĩ copia oguahẽ kuri George Wasington 6 jasykõiramo, oñemoñe'ẽ va'ekue tropa-kuérape **Nueva York-pe** 9 jasykõime."" (A copy was sent to George Washington on the 6th of the month, to be read to the troops in **New York** on the 9th.)

This directly links a Dunlap broadside (the copies made) being sent to New York.  The other options are not mentioned in the text as destinations for the broadside.



"
Moõpa oñemohenda raka'e Coronel Stark tropa-kuéra?,"The correct answer is **A: Norte apýra gotyo, cerca pukukuépe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Stark ñorairõharakuéra oñemohenda kuri pe **cerca pukukuépe pe Colono-kuéra renda norte apýra gotyo**..."" which translates to ""Stark's soldiers were positioned on the **pukukué (redoubt) near the north**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Peteĩ tembe’y oĩva y rembeʼýpe** - This refers to a breach in the Mystic River, not the location of the troops.
*   **C: Península norte gotyogua pukukuére** - While mentioned, it doesn't specify *where* Stark positioned his troops.
*   **D: Cerca rovái** - This refers to the stake/barrier Gridley or Stark set up, not the troops' overall positioning.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka'épa Stark tropa-kuéra omyasãi ikorakuéra?","The correct answer is **B: Regular-kuéra ohasa rire pe estaca**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gridley térã Stark omoĩ kuri peteĩ estaca peteĩ 30 m(100 pies)cerca rovái ha he'i ani avave ombokapu umi regular-kuéra ohasa peve.""  This translates to ""Gridley or Stark placed a stake with a 30m fence around it and said no one should let the regulars pass it.""  Therefore, Stark's troops waited for the regulars to attempt to pass the stake/fence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Colono-kuéra ojerure aja pytyvõ:** While the text mentions the colonists preparing, it doesn't state *when* Stark's troops attacked.
*   **C: Marea baja jave:** The low tide is mentioned as a factor in creating a gap, but not as a trigger for the attack.
*   **D: Umi tropa-kuéra omombarete jave pe tenda oĩhápe:** The text mentions the troops were stationed at the tents, but not that they attacked *because* they were stationed there.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa oiko peteĩ tahyi aty ejército rehere oikundaha aja?","The correct answer is **C: Oñembohupa ha oguerova hikuái 17 ára rire** (They rest and return after 17 days).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko mba'e oiko sapy'a ha ñeikundaha ikatu hi'are 17 ára."" (This happens repeatedly and they can be gone for up to 17 days.) This directly links resting and returning with the 17-day timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñembohupa hikuái pyharekue** (They rest during the day) - While they *do* rest during the day, it's not the defining characteristic of their cycle.
* **B: Sa'ive hembi'u hikuái** (They start resting after eating) - This is mentioned, but it's a *part* of the cycle, not the overall outcome of being ""gone.""
* **D: Oguata hikuái arakuépe** (They go out in the evening) - This is when they *leave*, not what happens while they are ""gone.""

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba’e mombe'u ko'ã apytégui ohechauka porã mba’eichaitépa umi tahýi aty ejército ojepokuaa jehupapope oikundaha aja?","The correct answer is **B: Oikundaha hikuái 17 ára opytu'uỹme**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko mba'e oiko sapy'a ha ñeikundaha ikatu hi'are 17 ára."" (This happens continuously and it is estimated it can last 17 days). This directly answers the question of how long the army of ants is observed to be moving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oñembohupa hikuái pyharekue** - While they move during the day, the question asks about the *duration* of their movement, not *when* they move.
*   **C: Oguerova hikuái ihupa ára ha ára** -  This describes that they move day and night, but doesn't give a specific timeframe for the observation.
*   **D: Oiporu hikuái hupakuéra oguerova'ỹme hi'are aja ñeikundaha** - This talks about their purpose and the estimation of their duration, but isn’t a direct answer to the question.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytégui oikota jepénte oĩramo okapegua apañuãi?,"The correct answer is **C: Reloj biológico**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Reloj biológico oikóva ijeheguireínte ha oikove aréta jepéramo ndaipóri okápegua apañuãi"" which translates to ""The biological clock lives within and continues to function even without external cues.""  This directly answers the question of what continues to function even *without* external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ciclo endógeno (Endogenous cycle):** While related, the passage uses ""ciclo endógeno"" to *describe* what the biological clock *is*, not what *continues functioning* without cues.
* **B: Ritmo jepivegua (Daily rhythm):**  These rhythms are *influenced* by the biological clock, but aren't the thing that functions independently of external cues.
* **D: Ritmo ojekuaáva (Adjusted rhythm):** This implies a rhythm that *has* been influenced by cues, the opposite of what the question asks.



"
Mba'e término-pa omombe'u umi individuo-kuéra ohechaukávo oguerekoha rasgo fenotípico?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimórfico**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Umi individuo-kuéra ohechaukávo oguerekoha hetamba'e imba'eva añónte ojehero hína polimórfico."" This directly translates to ""The individuals observed having diverse characteristics are called polymorphic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomórfico:** The passage defines monomorphic as *lacking* diversity in phenotypic traits. It's the opposite of what the question asks for.
* **B: Organísmo:** This is a general term for a living being, not a specific descriptor of trait diversity.
* **C: Especie:** This means ""species"" and refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed, not their physical characteristics.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apyra apytépe oje'éva hína umi organismo oikóva peteĩ tenda imba'eteévape?,"The correct answer is **D: Polimórfico**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Umi individuo-kuéra ohechaukávo oguerekoha hetamba'e imba'eva añónte ojehero hína polimórfico."" This directly translates to ""Individuals showing different variations are called polymorphic.""  The passage defines polymorphic organisms as those with varying characteristics within a population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomórfico:** The passage states monomorphic individuals *lack* variation (""ojojoguáramo rasgo fenotípico ojueheguápe""), which is the opposite of what the question asks about organisms *with* variation.
* **B: Atýpegua:**  ""Atýpegua"" means population, which is the general group being discussed, not the *description* of organisms with variation.
* **C: Especie:** ""Especie"" means species, which is a broader classification than describing variations within a population.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""ta'ãnga ñeguenohẽ"" (walkway) and Borneo's orangutan life as an example of eco-tourism.** This directly connects to observing the ecosystem and wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jeguata peteĩ ytu peve** (Simply a flower) - This is too general and doesn't relate to eco-tourism or the examples given.
* **C: Museo ciencia rehegua jeike** (Visiting a science museum) -  While educational, a science museum isn't directly related to experiencing a natural environment.
* **D: Pesca** (Fishing) - While *mentioned* in the passage as an activity *within* eco-tourism, it's not an example *of* the type of eco-tourism being described – which focuses on observation and learning.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytépe oñemopyenda pe sistema mba'yrumýi rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Mba'yrumýi ijara teéva** (The existing ecosystem).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...opavave ojoaju ha oykeko peteĩ mba'yrumýi ñemohendaporã oñemopyendáva mba'yrumỹi ijara teévape.""  This translates to ""...everyone joins and there is a well-structured ecosystem being modified by the existing ecosystem.""

The passage describes how the current ecosystem (mba'yrumýi ijara teéva) is being altered and used to support human activity and further change.  The other options are components *within* that ecosystem, but not the system being modified itself.

* **A: Mba'apohápe (Work)** is an activity *within* the ecosystem.
* **C: Biósfera estado opytávape (Biosphere state)** is a broader concept; the ecosystem is *part* of the biosphere.
* **D: Evolución humana (Human evolution)** is a process influenced *by* the ecosystem, not the thing being modified.



"
"Umi partícula ojeréva núcleo rehe, mba'éichagua carga oguereko?","The correct answer is **A: Carga positivo-va** (Positive charge).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Protón-kuéra oguereko peteĩ carga eléctrica positivo-va ha katu neutrón-kuéra ndoguerekói carga."" This translates to ""Protons have a positive electric charge and neutrons do not have a charge.""

Therefore, the particles within the nucleus (protons and neutrons) have a positive charge (due to the protons) and no charge (due to the neutrons). The question asks about the charge *they* have, and the dominant charge present is positive.



"
Mba'e partícula oreko umi núcleo-kuéra?,"The correct answer is **A: Protón ha neutrón-kuéra** (Protons and neutrons).

The text explicitly states: ""Nucleo oguereko mokõi partícula: neutrón ha protón-kuéra."" (The nucleus contains two particles: neutrons and protons.)
"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ikatu ha'e papapy binario orekóva po bit?","The question asks for a valid binary code (a code consisting of only 0s and 1s). Let's examine each option:

* **A: 1010** - Contains only 0s and 1s. This is a valid binary code.
* **B: 12001** - Contains the number '2', which is not a valid binary digit.
* **C: 10010** - Contains only 0s and 1s. This is a valid binary code.
* **D: 110101** - Contains only 0s and 1s. This is a valid binary code.

The question doesn't specify a length for the binary code, only that it *is* a binary code.  Since A, C, and D are all valid, and there's no further information to distinguish them, any of them could be the answer. However, generally the simplest answer is preferred.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: 1010** because it's the shortest and simplest valid binary code among the options.



"
Papapy binario mba'éicha avei ojeikuaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...papapy binario orekokuaa peteĩ térã mokõi valor, upéva he'ise 0 térã 1, ha ko'ã papapy ojeikuaa papapy binario-ramo, **térã bits**, ojeiporu haguã peteĩ jerga informática.""  This directly defines binary digits as ""bits"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Valor (Value):** While bits *represent* values (0 or 1), ""valor"" is too broad.  The question asks *what they are called*.
* **C: Jerga (Jargon):**  Jerga is the overall language/terminology, not the individual units.
* **D: Oñemohendáva (Manipulated/Engineered):** This describes what's *done* with binary, not what the units themselves are called.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Jepéramo temimbo’ekuéra katuínte oñepyrü hembiasa blog ñepyrũme peteĩ gramática ha ortografía ivaíva rehe."" (Even though bloggers initially use blogs to improve their grammar and spelling). This is presented as a primary reason for starting a blog.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sa'ive crítica tapichágui** (Critical audience): While the text mentions a critical audience is helpful, it isn't the *primary* benefit discussed for the bloggers themselves.
*   **C: Jeikuaave umi mba’e jere rehegua** (Learning about interesting things): The text says blogs *help* audiences learn, not necessarily that this is the main benefit *for the bloggers*.
*   **D: Ñemongyre’ỹ ojeipysove hag̃ua jeikuaapy** (Facilitating information sharing): This is a benefit, but it's a consequence of blogging, not the initial reason for it according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ombohovái hemimo'ã tapicha oihaíva rovake oĩva internet-pe** - This is *a* benefit of blogs mentioned in the text, but it doesn't directly answer the question of *how* blogs help improve writing.
* **C: Tekotevẽ oĩva oñemongyre’ỹve hag̃ua oporohechávape** -  This refers to the need for blogs to be promoted for readership, not how they help writers.
* **D: Tekotevẽ ñepytyvõgui** - This is about blogs being helpful in general, not specifically related to improving writing through a critical audience.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndaha'éi beneficio comunicación asíncrona temimbo'ekuérape? ,"The correct answer is **B: Jojehechahápe instructor-ndive taha’e ha’éva aravópe** (Contact with the instructor whenever needed).

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication *allows* students to contact instructors ""taha'e ha'éva aravópe"" (whenever they need to) and work on assignments at their own pace. This is a *benefit* of asynchronous communication. The question asks which is *NOT* a benefit.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits mentioned in the text:

* **A: Internet jeporu marandu topa hag̃ua** (Internet provides access to information) - The passage explicitly states the internet ""ojeja temimbo'épe oguerekóvo marandu hekoitépe"" (allows students to access a wealth of information).
* **C: Sa’ive ojehapejoko arange, oguereko posibilidad omba’apóvo** (Flexibility to schedule work and possibility to participate) - The passage says ""sa’ive ojehapejoko arange, ikatuhápe oguereko posibilidad omba’apóvo"" (flexibility in scheduling and possibility to participate).
* **D: Ritmo imba'évape** (Working at your own pace) - The passage states it allows work ""omba’apóvo ritmo imba’évape"" (work at your own pace).



Therefore, option B is the only one that isn't directly presented as a benefit in the provided text. While contact with instructors is *possible* through asynchronous communication, the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary *benefit* – it's more a *facilitated action*."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã comunicación asíncrona rehegua apytégui ndaha'éi temimbo'ekuérapeguarã?","The correct answer is **B: Ñemba'apo ritmo** (Work rhythm).

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication *allows* people to work at their own pace and schedule (""ritmo imba’évape""). The passage highlights this as a benefit. The question asks what is *not* a characteristic of this type of communication *for students*.  Working at one's own pace is precisely what asynchronous communication enables, so it's a characteristic *of* it, and therefore not something it lacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemoarandu ritmo** (Study rhythm) -  While related to work rhythm, the passage specifically mentions the *work* rhythm, not necessarily the study rhythm.
* **C: Marandu oporohekombo’éva** (Available information) - The passage *states* asynchronous communication provides access to information.
* **D: Internet jeporu** (Internet access) -  The passage explicitly mentions the internet as a facilitator of this communication.



Therefore, **Ñemba'apo ritmo** is the answer that doesn't describe a benefit or aspect of asynchronous communication mentioned in the text as being advantageous to students. It's a characteristic it *allows*, not something it *lacks*."
Mba’épa noñeñe’ẽi ko maranduhaipe ikatúva ojoaju castillo medieval rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mazmorra**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""mazmorra"" (dungeon)** when describing the feeling of adventure and imagining knights and castles. It talks about the ""kyhyje ry'akuã osẽva mazmorra guive"" - ""the strange sound coming from the dungeon.""

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **B: Justa-kuéra (Tournaments):** While tournaments were *associated* with medieval castles and knighthood, the passage doesn't specifically mention them.
* **C: Caballería (Chivalry):**  This is a concept linked to the period, but not a *physical* element of a castle itself.
* **D: Caballero-kuéra (Knights):**  Knights inhabited castles, but the passage isn't asking for something *within* a castle, but something mentioned *in* the description.



Therefore, **Mazmorra** is the most directly referenced element of a medieval castle in the provided text."

Here's why:

The passage describes a medieval castle inspiring imagination, with knights, large battles, and the Arthurian age. It specifically mentions ""ñahetũ pe kyhyje ry'akuã osẽva mazmorra guive"" - *watching the dungeon ghost emerge from the dungeon*.  This clearly links ""kyhyje"" (ghost) to an element commonly associated with castles and the imagined stories surrounding them.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ñorairõ (War):** While war is *part* of the imagery, it's a broader concept and not a specific element *within* the castle itself.
* **C: Karu guasu (Large battle):** Similar to war, this is an event that happens *around* the castle, not necessarily *in* it.
* **D: Kavaju py ryapu (Horseback archers):** While present in the imagined scenarios, they are not a core, structural element of the castle's mystique like a ghost in the dungeon is.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1480 década-pe, Lord Hasting oñepyrũramo guare omopu’ã..."" (In the 1480s, Lord Hastings began to build...). This directly supports the idea that he initiated the castle's construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oikotevẽva’ekue sa'i ñangareko oñemopu'ãramoguare pe tetãme ojeiko rupi py'aguapype** (It was necessary to build it bigger to support the country in a difficult situation) - While the passage *implies* a strategic need, it doesn't explicitly state it was *necessary* to build it bigger due to the country's state. It says it was built to accommodate his men.
* **C: Pe castillo ñemopu'ã ndaha'éiva'ekue típico upe época-pe g̃uarã** (The castle's construction wasn't typical for that time) -  The passage mentions it had large crystal windows and was designed for defense, suggesting it *was* notable, but doesn't directly say it was atypical.
* **D: Oñemopu'ã kuri ombohovake are hag̃ua ataque-kuéra** (It was built to defend against attacks) - While defense was a consideration (it mentions preparing for an attack), the primary reason given is to house his men.

Here's why:

* The text states that Lord Hasting began to fortify the castle in the 1480s because the country was in a precarious situation and needed to be prepared to defend against potential attacks.  This directly points to a plan to prepare for an attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ovetã tuicháva** (A great view) - While the text mentions a view of crystal, it's not the *main* point about the castle.
* **C: Sa'ive jeñangareko ambue castillo-gui** (Similar to building another castle) - The text doesn't mention comparisons to other castles.
* **D: Agyke pererĩ** (It is very old) -  The text states it's being fortified, implying age, but that's not the central idea.

The passage states: ""Peteĩ ñeñani campo traviesa rehe, oñembojoapývo tembiapo gimnacio-pe tete yvate gotyoguápe, upéva oiko porãvéva hína ñeñani temporada-pe guarã.""  This translates to: ""A cross-country race, combined with work in the gym with high intensity, is very good for the racing season.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says that **training in the gym with high intensity** is what helps prepare someone well for a racing season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñeñani campo traviesa rehe arahaku jave** (A cross-country race in the morning) - While cross-country is mentioned, it's the *combination* with gym work that's highlighted as beneficial.
* **B: Jeheka pya’eve hag̃ua práctica-jave** (To run fast in practice) - The passage doesn’t focus on speed, but endurance and preparation.
* **C: Pya'eve mbohapy aravo'ígui** (Running three times a week) - The frequency of running isn’t the key point.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ãva apytegui imba'eguasuvéva peteĩ oñanítavape primera clase medio kilómetro-gua?","The correct answer is **C: Omarkávi mbykyve mokõi aravo'igui**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""medio kilómetro primera clase-pe, peteĩ tapicha oguahẽkuaa mokõi aravo'ípe ipya'e nunga va'erã...""  This directly translates to ""in the first class half-kilometer, a person appeared two times trying to pass...""  Therefore, appearing twice is what distinguishes them in that race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñeñani campo traviesa rehe araro'y jave** - While cross-country training is mentioned, it doesn't explain what sets someone apart *in the first class half-kilometer*.
* **B: Resistencia oñemomba'eguasuvéramo pya'ekuaágui** -  The passage mentions resistance is important, but doesn't state it's *why* this person stands out.
* **D: Pya'ekuaa oñemomba'eguasuvéramo resistencia-gui** - This is similar to B; resistance is mentioned, but isn't the defining characteristic in this specific instance.

"Atléta-pe g̃uarã, mávapa ko apytégui ndaikatúi ojehupyty práctica nutricional rupivente?","The correct answer is **C: Rendimiento yvateve** (High performance).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ndaikatúi ojepo peteĩ rendimiento yvatéva"" - meaning it cannot achieve a *high performance*.  The question asks what this practice *cannot* do for athletes.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Rendimiento poravẽ** (Good performance) - The passage suggests it falls short of *high* performance, not just any good performance.
    * **B: Jevy’ave** (Recovery) - While nutrition aids recovery, the passage focuses on overall performance.
    * **D: Jeiko porã** (Good health) -  The passage notes the athlete *is* already healthy (""jeiko porã""), but still lacks optimal performance.

Therefore, the passage directly states this practice won't lead to **high performance**.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndoje'éi atleta imitãvape g̃uarã ovy'ave hag̃ua ojapo jave deporte?","The correct answer is **D: Eguerekóramo equilibrio energético**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...eguerekóramo equilibrio energético, hey'u heta ha ojesareko heta suplementación apo rehe oipytyvõkuaáva atleta-kuérape oiko porãve haguã rendimiento orekóva ha ovy'ave haguã ojapo jave deporte.""  This translates to ""...therefore energy balance, eating a lot and considering a lot of supplementation help athletes to maintain their performance and improve their ability to practice their sport.""

The question asks what, *according to the text*, helps young athletes improve their performance. The text directly links **energy balance** (eguerekóramo equilibrio energético) to improved performance and the ability to continue participating in sports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jekaru porã** - ""Being healthy"" is a general statement and not specifically mentioned as a way to *improve* performance in the passage.
*   **B: Katuete ojapova'erã rendimiento yvatéva** - ""Even if they don't have great performance"" is the opposite of what the passage is about.
*   **C: Jey'u heta** - ""Eating a lot"" is mentioned *along with* energy balance and supplementation, but isn't presented as the core factor for improvement.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére oñaníva media distancia ikatu ojogua mba'erepykue hepyvéva?","The correct answer is **C: Oreko rupi impacto irendimientope**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...mba'erepykuéra ojejoguakuaa katu hetave oguerekóta sa'i térã mboyve impacto social rendimiento orekóvape."" (Teams consider many things, including the small or large impact on performance.) This directly links the choices made in middle-distance running to performance impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñandu mba'érepa oipotave** (Understanding why they compete) - While the passage mentions understanding *why* athletes compete, it doesn't explain *how* middle-distance running choices relate to that.
* **B: Oreko rupi beneficio** (Having a benefit) - The passage mentions benefits exist, but doesn't say how choices in middle-distance running specifically relate to those benefits.
* **D: Oĩ heta concepto ojavýva umi equipo ndahepýiva rehe** (There are many concepts influencing non-competitive teams) - This refers to teams generally, not specifically to the choices made *within* middle-distance running to affect performance.



Therefore, option C best answers the question based on the information provided in the passage."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oikotevẽ ñeñani hag̃ua media distancia?","The correct answer is **A: Heta equipo**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Ñeñani orekóva media distancia hína peteĩ deporte ndahepýiva; katu oĩ heta concepto ojavýva umi **equipo** ojeiporu va'erãva ojejapo haguã.""  (Middle-distance running is an individual sport; but there are many concepts involving the **teams** that support it to be done.)

The passage explicitly mentions the importance of teams in supporting middle-distance runners, even though it's an individual sport.  The question asks what is *needed* to run middle distance, and the passage highlights teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nde deportistava'erã** (Your teammate) - While teammates can be helpful, the passage focuses on the broader concept of supporting teams, not just a single teammate.
* **C: Sa'i equipo** (Small team) - The passage doesn't specify the *size* of the team, just that teams are involved.
* **D: Heta pirapire** (Many shoes) - Shoes are equipment, but not the core support system discussed in the text.

Mávatepa oikuaapyva'ekue Resonancia magnética? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ha Purcell**.

The text explicitly states: ""Resonancia magnética ha’e peteĩ física-pegua fenómeno (RMN), ojekuaa’ypyva’ekue 1930-pe Felix Block rupive ha Edward Purcell..."" (Resonance magnetic is a physical phenomenon (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell...).

Therefore, both Bloch and Purcell are credited with the discovery of magnetic resonance.



"
Mba'e arýpe oñeme'ẽ patente ñepyrũ yvy'ape'ári? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Irundy ary uperire oñeme’ẽ peteĩ patente, ha’éva patente ñepyrũ yvy’ape’ári..."" which translates to ""Three years later he was granted a patent, being the first patent in this area...""  Since Damadian filed the patent in 1970, three years later would be 1973/1974. While the exact year isn't explicitly stated as 1974, it's the closest and most logical option given the information.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1977** - This is the year Damadian demonstrated the first full-body MRI scanner, not when he received the first patent.
*   **C: 1930** - This is when RMN was discovered, not when the patent was granted.
*   **D: 1970** - This is when Damadian *began* using RMN for diagnostics, not when the patent was awarded.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oikuaava'erã avakuéra ikatu hag̃ua oikuaa ambue tapicha remimo'ã?","The correct answer is **A: Oipotáva** (being able to).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Péva he’ise ikatuha roimo’ã ambue yvypóra oñandúva, ojaposéva, oimo’ãva, **oikuaáva teã oipotáva**.""  This translates to: ""This means we can imagine another person existing, making, thinking, **being able to feel**.""

The passage is discussing the capacity to empathize - to understand what another person is feeling.  ""Oipotáva"" directly relates to the ability to *feel* what another person feels, which is the core of understanding their emotional state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojaposéva** (making) - While we can imagine someone *doing* something, that's not the core of understanding their *feeling*.
* **C: Oimo'ãva** (thinking) -  Knowing what someone thinks is different than understanding how they *feel*.
* **D: Oñandúva** (existing) - Just knowing someone exists doesn't give you insight into their emotional state.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oipytyvõ yvypórape oikuaávõ ambue tapicha ojaposéva?","The correct answer is **B: Eikuaa ojeipotáva**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Techapyrã, ehecháramo ambue tapichápe ojokávo mba’yrumýi ventanilla, ikatu reimo’ã hína omondaseha hapicha oikuaa’ỹva mba’yrumýi.""  This translates to: ""For example, if you see another person knocking on a window, it can be imagined that a skilled person is seeing the window.""

This directly illustrates the ability to *understand what is being done* (ojeipotáva - being done) by another person. The passage explains how observing someone's actions allows you to imagine their perception of the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeipe'a jeikuaa'ỹ ambue ojapóvare** (Even if you don't know what another person is doing) - The passage focuses on *understanding* what is happening, not the lack of understanding.
*   **C: Emaña ambue tapichare ehusga'ỹme** (Not paying attention to another person) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
*   **D: Emoñe'ẽ ambue temimo'ã** (Talking about what another person thinks) - The passage discusses *seeing* and *understanding* actions, not necessarily discussing someone's thoughts.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ã mombyky apytégui añete IA rembipota guasuvéva?","The correct answer is **C: Programación**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Techapyrã ryepýpe oĩ control rape’apo ha **programación**, ñembohovaikuaa umi diagnóstico ha hasýva ñeporandu..."" (Among others are control, **programming**, understanding diagnoses and making predictions...).  This directly links programming as a key component of how IA functions and is built.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rape'apo (Control):** While control is *part* of IA, programming is the fundamental process of *creating* the control.
*   **B: Ñe'ẽ jeikuaa (Language understanding):** Language understanding is a *result* of IA, not a core building block.
*   **D: Máquina apo omba’pótava ijeheguíntema (Machine learning):** Machine learning is a *method* IA uses, but programming is what allows for machine learning to happen.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui IA-pe ko'ãga oñemoirũve?","The correct answer is **B: Rape'apo ha programación**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Techapyrã ryepýpe oĩ **control rape’apo ha programación**, ñembohovaikuaa umi diagnóstico ha hasýva ñeporandu..."" (In practical examples there is **control, work and programming**, understanding diagnoses and conducting research...).  This directly links these elements as components of IA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ñembohovái hasývape (Understanding diagnoses):** While mentioned in the text, it's a *result* of IA, not a foundational component *used to build* it.
*   **C: Ciencia ficción (Science fiction):** The text acknowledges a science fiction connotation, but it's not what IA *is* built from.
*   **D: Pópe jehai jeikuaa (Being able to speak and learn):** This is a *capability* of IA, not a core element *used to create* it.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Pe mba'e tuichaveva ko metalidad rehegua ha'e hina: peteĩ ñembohovái añoite oĩ porã."" which translates to ""The most important thing about this mentality is: a hypothesis that is well founded.""  This aligns directly with the idea of a thought process focused on identifying what *is* and then working to find what *could be* or improve upon it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Heta ñembohovái oĩ porã** (Many hypotheses are good) - While true in general, the text doesn’t emphasize the *quantity* of good hypotheses, but the *quality* and foundation of one.
* **B: Jeipuru mba'e kuaa pyahu** (Knowing a lot) - Knowing things is important, but the text focuses on using knowledge to form a strong initial hypothesis.
* **D: Omoinge iñakape patrón-kuéra** (Challenging patterns) - While logical thinking can lead to challenging patterns, the core idea presented is about building *from* a solid foundation of what is already known.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndaha'éi ohekáva ko ñepensa patrón?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ ñembohovái añoite oĩ porã** (A good initial hypothesis).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe mba'e tuichaveva ko metalidad rehegua ha'e hina: peteĩ ñembohovái añoite oĩ porã."" (The most important thing about this mentality is: a good initial hypothesis.)

The passage emphasizes the importance of starting with a well-formed hypothesis as a crucial element of this type of thinking. The other options are *components* used *to create* a good hypothesis (data gathering, research, etc.), but the hypothesis itself is the key missing element when this type of thinking isn't applied.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndojeikuaaichéne microexpresión-kuéra ramo?","The correct answer is **C: Pya'e esapymi** (Difficulty concentrating).

Here's why:

The passage explains that people with brain damage, like those described by Oliver Sacks, have trouble *understanding* language, and can appear to be saying things that don't make sense.  This is linked to difficulty in recognizing even subtle cues like microexpressions. The passage suggests that damage to the brain can affect the ability to process and interpret information, leading to a lack of focus or difficulty concentrating on details like microexpressions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemaña ambuegotyo eñe'ẽaja** (Speaking a different language) - The passage isn't about people speaking different languages, it's about understanding language.
* **B: Odeforma pe hova** (The smell is deformed) - This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Poguasu yvate gotyo** (Very high volume) -  This also has nothing to do with the passage's content.

Mávapa ko'ã techaukaha apytépe microexpresión-kuéra rehegua ndaha'éiva añetegua?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñe'ẽ ha tova ku'e ikatu ojeikumby**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Oliver Sacks, in *The President Speech*, discusses how people with cerebral damage *cannot* fully express themselves through language.  This directly relates to the idea of difficulty communicating (ojeikumby - to communicate).  The passage highlights the inability to *fully* utilize language despite potentially understanding microexpressions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grabación jeiporu omohenda kuri heta mba'e ojejuhúva** - This simply states the recording contains a lot of information; it doesn't relate to the *difficulty* in understanding or expressing.
* **B: Jajesareko porãramo ikatu ojeikuaa peteĩ tapichápa ijapu** - This refers to being able to recognize someone's lies, which is a consequence of understanding microexpressions, but doesn't address the core issue of *inability* to communicate.
* **D: Ikatu ohechakuaa he'i añetéva** - This means ""it can be seen he is saying something,"" which is not about a *lack* of communication, but rather its visibility.

Mávapa ko'ã apytépe mba'e guasuve Renacimiento rupive? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mba'ekuaa ñemosarambi** (Understanding of conflict).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Upéicha, Renacimiento omoamue kuri mba'ejekuaa enfoque ha **mba'ekuaa ñemosarambi**."" (Thus, the Renaissance brought understanding of approach and **understanding of conflict**).

The question asks what was gained with the Renaissance, and the passage explicitly states that understanding of conflict was one of those gains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tapicha imanu'áva** (People/Individuals) - The passage mentions people but doesn't say they were *gained* through the Renaissance.
*   **C: Jehaipy jegueromandu'a** (Specific approach) - While an approach is mentioned, it's not presented as something *gained* from the Renaissance.
*   **D: Mba'ejekuaa jeguereko** (Having knowledge) - This is too general and doesn't pinpoint a specific gain mentioned in the text.



"
"Renacimiento rupive, mba'épe oĩ sa'ive enfoque ko'ã apytégui?","The correct answer is **B: Mba'ejekuaa jeguereko** (What is known/understood).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Renaissance brought a new *enfoque* (focus/approach) to *mba'ejekuaa* (what is known/understood) and *mba'ekuaa ñemosarambi* (the way of learning).  The question asks what the Renaissance shifted the focus *to* regarding these things.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tapicha imanu'áva (Humans)** - While the Renaissance *did* see a renewed focus on humanity (humanism), the passage doesn't say the *enfoque* itself was humans. It was a change *in how* things were understood.
* **C: Jehaipy jegueromandu'a (The act of learning)** - This is *related* to the change, but it's not the focus itself.  The passage says the Renaissance brought a focus *to* learning, but the focus is what *is* learned.
* **D: Mba'ekuaa ñemosarambi (The way of learning)** - Similar to C, this is *how* things changed, not *what* the new focus *was*.



Therefore, **B: Mba'ejekuaa jeguereko** best captures the essence of the passage – the Renaissance brought a new way of *knowing* and *understanding*."

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that ""umi relacion ipukuva"" (forming relationships) is a strong motivator for internet use, according to Eighmey and McCord (1998).  This directly relates to people wanting to connect with and learn about others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Red de negocio-kuéra (Business networks):** While the internet *can* be used for business, the text doesn't highlight this as a primary motivational factor.
* **B: Nde rogayguandi reĩ hag̃ua en contacto (Your desire to stay in contact):**  This is related to relationships, but the text focuses on the *formation* of relationships, not just maintaining existing ones.
* **C: Viaje jeheka (Looking for trips):** The text doesn't mention travel as a motivator.



"
"Ko'ã apytégui, máva ndojehechaukái motivación pe jepytaso ndete ejapova eipuru hag̃ua internet?","The correct answer is **D: Viropukuaa jemaneha** (Emotional reward/gratification).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that """"Pe jepytaso ndete ejapova"""" (""the pleasure of self-expression"") is an aspect of motivation for using the internet, as identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998).  ""Viropukuaa jemaneha"" directly translates to emotional reward or gratification, which aligns perfectly with the idea of finding pleasure in expressing oneself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Receta jeheka (Recipe seeking):** The passage doesn't mention searching for recipes as a motivation.
* **B: Panel de discusión jehecahuka (Panel discussion seeking):** While internet facilitates discussion, the passage doesn't focus on this specifically.
* **C: Pohã jeheka (Game seeking):** Games aren't mentioned as a primary motivator in the provided text.



"
Araka'e Europa occidente-gua oñypurũ oguerojera estilo imba'evoi?,"The correct answer is **A: Edad media paha rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Edad media ipaha gotyo Europa occidente-gua oguerojera ñepyrũ kuri estilo imba'evavoi..."" which translates to ""Western Europe began to show a new style at the end of the Middle Ages...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Byzantine época rupi:** The text says the Gothic style *developed* from Byzantine, but wasn't *introduced* by it to Western Europe.
* **C: 25 ary rupi edad media rire:**  While the text mentions 25-30 years for the style's spread, it doesn't indicate that's when it was *first* seen.
* **D: Siglo 11 jave:** The text states the Gothic period existed from the 10th/11th centuries *through* the 14th century, but doesn't say it began being shown in Western Europe in the 11th century. It says it started later, at the *end* of the Middle Ages.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...upéramo guare ojejapo rupi cruzada-kuéra tapichakuéra oiporu ñepyrũ kuri votõ ao oñembojokupyty hag̃ua.""  This translates to ""...especially when the people of the Crusades began to build their churches to defend themselves.""

Therefore, the text directly links the building of fortified churches to the Crusades.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ha'éne ipukúva rehegua myatyrõ tekohape ğuarã?","The correct answer is **A: Ñembyai yvypóra rekove asa extravagante-va** (Concern about extravagant human lifestyles).

Here's why:

The passage expresses concern about ""superpoblación ha yvypóra rekove asa extravagante-va"" (overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles).  The author links this to the challenges faced by the environment and suggests it's a key problem alongside the lack of a comprehensive solution (ñemyatyrõ sapy'a).  The passage frames this lifestyle as contributing to the problems needing treatment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Activismo (Activism):** While the passage implies a need for change, it doesn't specifically focus on activism as the core issue it identifies.
* **C: Jajuhuva'erã apañuái rapo (Looking for quick fixes):** The passage *criticizes* looking for quick fixes, saying that symptomatic treatment isn't enough.
* **D: Jajoajukuaa tekoha rehe oku'éva ndive (Understanding what the environment needs):**  While understanding the environment is important, the passage frames *human behavior* (extravagant lifestyles) as a central problem *causing* environmental issues, not just needing to understand those issues.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytégui ndaha'eichene tratamiento sintomático tekohape ğuarã?","The correct answer is **A: Jajoaju oku'éva ndive**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jaiko porãkuaave ñande rekoha ndive, **jajoajukuaa tekoha rehe oku'éva ndive**, ha upéicha avei ikatu ñande ñamokyre'ỹ ñambosa'ive haguã jeiko asy ágã tenonderãve oikokuaáva.""  This translates to: ""We greatly value our environment, **we need to understand what the environment offers**, and in this way we can also strengthen our efforts to achieve a good quality of life with sustainable development.""

The question asks what, according to the text, indicates that these things aren't simply symptomatic treatment.  Understanding *what the environment offers* (jajoajukuaa tekoha rehe oku'éva ndive) is the key – it's moving beyond just treating the symptoms to addressing the root causes and finding sustainable solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñamboguete apañuái rapo.** (We continue to investigate) - This is mentioned but doesn't explain *why* it's more than symptomatic treatment.
* **C: Ñame'ẽ ñande remiandu yvypóra rekove asa extravagante-va rehe** (We share our knowledge about the extravagant lifestyle of humans) - This is a related observation, but not the core reason why it's not just symptomatic.
* **D: Jaiko porãkuaave ñande rekoha ndive** (We greatly value our environment) -  Valuing the environment is important, but it doesn't inherently mean it's more than symptomatic treatment.  You need to *understand* what the environment offers to move beyond just treating the symptoms of environmental problems.

Mba'e tetãme raka'e tendondetegua ñorairõ Europa-pe oje'e pokatu ñembojoja rupi jeroviapy rangue rehe?,"The correct answer is **D: España-pe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Pe Guerra de Sucesión española omoñepyrũ peteĩha ñorairõ ha upépe ojeheka va'ekue pe pokatu rekojoja.""  This translates to ""The War of the Spanish Succession began the first war and in it, the consequences of the pokatu (balance of power) were shown.""

The passage directly links the concept of the balance of power to the Spanish War of Succession. Therefore, Spain is the country most directly associated with the development of the balance of power system in Europe as described in the text.



"
"""Máva ñorairõpe ojeikuaa sapy'a avei """"ñorairõ jeroviapy rehe""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Guerra de los Treinta Años**.

The text specifically states: ""Upevare, pe Guerra de los Treinta Años ha’éta pe ipahapegua ojeherótava ñorãirõ jeroviapy rehe."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War is considered the first war fought over religious conflicts.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Guerra de los Cien Años (Hundred Years' War):** The text doesn't mention this war in connection to religious conflicts.
* **C: Guerra de Sucesión española (War of the Spanish Succession):** While mentioned in the text, it's described as *beginning* a conflict about sovereignty, not being the first religious war.
* **D: Guerra civil española (Spanish Civil War):** This war occurred much later and is not discussed in the provided text.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that despite the challenges and criticisms, the Catholic Church *continues* to uphold its principles (""añetehápepa oñemboguata hína ko’ã principio"").  The passage describes how these principles, despite being used for both good and ill, remain central to the Church's power and existence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pirapire tupão ryepýpepa oñemboja'o porã (The wealth of the Church is well managed):** While the passage mentions wealth (""heta pira pire""), it doesn't say it's *well managed*.  In fact, the implication is that it's a source of power and potentially corruption.
* **B: Umi principio religión he'ívapa ojeguerovava'erã (The religious principles are changing):** The passage specifically says the opposite – they are being *held onto* stubbornly.
* **C: Poder oñembyatýva tupãope (Power is concentrated in the Church):** The passage *describes* the Church's power, but doesn't state that this is what's preventing change.  The resistance *to* change is the key point.

The text states: ""ha rey reindy, Isabel, 6 japa 1789 ramo kuña ñemuhapegua aty pochy oñemyaña chupekuéra ojevy hag̃ua París-pe Versalles guive.""  This translates to: ""and the king's sister, Isabel, on July 6, 1789, a large group of women marched with them to bring them from Versailles to Paris.""

Therefore, a group of women is what initiated the movement *from* Versailles.



"

Here's why:

The passage states ""Umi tapicha ojopy Rey ha Reina-pe ombojurupe’a hag̃ua tuichakue carruaje rovetã"" which translates to ""The people watched the King and Queen, trying to slow down the heavy carriage.""  This clearly indicates their intention was to impede the carriage's progress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñeguenohẽ mbaretépe Versalles-gui** (To return quickly to Versailles) - The text says they are *going* to Paris *from* Versailles, not returning to Versailles.
* **C: Guardia akãngue jehecha** (To see the guard nearby) - While a guard is mentioned, the text doesn't suggest the people were watching him.
* **D: París-pe jevy** (To go to Paris) - They are *already* going to Paris; that's not why people are watching/trying to stop them.

Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndaha'éi Gran Bretaña convencional-ỹva rupi guerra naval?,"The correct answer is **A: Alemania ojapose rupi estrategia upéichagua** (Germany responded with this strategy).

Here's why:

The passage states that Gran Bretaña (Great Britain) initiated a naval blockade of Germany.  The passage *then* directly links this blockade to Germany's response:  ""Sa’imínte oñembohovái rupi ko estrategia, Alemania oha’arõ kuri oñembohovái chupe guerra submarina ojejoko’ỹvapeguáicha"" (Because of this strategy, Germany began to respond with unrestricted submarine warfare).  This means Germany's actions were *in response* to Britain's unconventional naval warfare (the blockade).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi barco neutral oñemoĩ peligro-pe** (Neutral ships were in danger) - While true, this is a *consequence* of the blockade, not *why* it was unconventional.
* **C: Oñemboambue umi derecho internacional-pe** (International law was changed) - The passage states the blockade *challenged* international law, it didn't change it.
* **D: Ojejoko opaichagua suministro oñeikotevẽvéva** (All supplies were cut off) - This describes the *effect* of the blockade, not why it wasn't a conventional naval war tactic.



"
Mávapa ko'ã ñe’ẽ apytégui ndaha'éi añetete upe bloqueo naval Gran Bretaña ojapóva Alemania rehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojoko opaichagua suministro Alemania-gui** (It blocked all supplies to Germany).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ojoko opaichagua suministro militar ha civil oñeikotevẽvéva"" - ""it blocked all military and civil supplies that needed to be sent."" This directly describes the effect of the naval blockade.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Opyrũ derecho internacional rehe** (It started with international law) - While the passage mentions international law and agreements, it's *context* for the blockade, not the blockade itself.
* **B: Omyaña Alemania guerra submarina** (It caused Germany to start submarine warfare) - The passage states the blockade *led to* Germany's response of submarine warfare, but it isn't *what the blockade is*.
* **D: Umi barco neutral ndoñemoĩri peligro-pe** (Neutral ships weren’t in danger) - The passage actually states the opposite – the blockade *created* a danger for neutral ships.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávape ikatuve ojediagnostica esclerosis múltiple?","The correct answer is **A: Kuña 32 ary orekóvape** (32-year-old woman).

**Reasoning:**

The text states: ""Jehapeka ohechakuaa kuri kuñanguérape ojo'aha mokõi posibilidad oreko hag̃ua EM kuimba'ekuéra rovake.""  This translates to ""Studies show that women have twice the possibility of developing MS compared to men.""  Therefore, a woman is more likely to be diagnosed.  Of the options, 32 is a reasonable age for diagnosis, and the text supports women being more susceptible.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kuimba'e 15 ary orekóvape** - While MS can occur at any age, it's less common in young boys.  The text also highlights women are *more* likely.
* **C: Kuimba'e 43 ary orekóvape** - Men can get MS, but the text indicates it's less frequent than in women.
* **D: Kuña 10 ary orekóvape** -  MS is rare in children.  It's typically diagnosed in young to middle adulthood.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, ambue ojapóva teteku'e mba'e oikotevẽve?","The correct answer is **A: Ykeko tasy percepción negativa rehe** (To understand the negative perception of pain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ambue ojapóva teteku'e oikotevẽve kuri ykeko tasy percepción negativa rehe..."" This directly translates to ""Another thing healthcare professionals need to do is understand the negative perception of pain.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lumbar:** While the passage mentions lumbar pain, it doesn't state that healthcare professionals *need to do* something related to the lumbar region itself.
* **C: Depresión:** Depression is mentioned as a consequence, not something to actively address *by* the healthcare professional in this context.
* **D: Kyhyje:** Kyhyje (fear/anxiety) is also a consequence, not the action the professional should take.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'éicha oñeha'ã esgrima?","The correct answer is **D: Duelo formato-pe**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ko ñoa'ãngatu oiko **duelo formato-ramo**, peteĩ escrima ra'ãha ambuéva rovake."" (This competition takes place in a **duel format**, a different style of fencing.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko'ãgagua formato** - This is too vague; the text doesn't define a specific ""this competition's format.""
*   **B: Mbo'ehaovusu formato** - While it mentions starting at a student level, the core format isn't *defined* as a student format.
*   **C: Nivel olímpico-pe** - The text mentions aiming for Olympic level, but doesn't say that's *how* the fencing is done.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ikatu ha'e síntoma envenenamiento hyepýpe rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Gue'ẽ ha ty'ái** (Vomiting and dizziness).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Síntoma-kuérape oikekuaa **gue'ẽ**, ojekuaá jepi..."" (Symptoms include **vomiting**, dizziness...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Py'ajere ha akanundu** (Sweat and shivers) - Not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Calambre ha tye rasy** (Cramps and dry throat) - Not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Pohã recetada ryru** (Prescribed medicine poisoning) -  The text discusses general poisoning, not specifically from prescribed medication.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ejapova'erã tenondete ejesareko hag̃ua víctima rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Ejesareko mba'écihapa opyta ra'e**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically states:** ""Ojesareko va'erã mba'écihapa opyta ra'e víctimia oñembojávo hese ha oĩmeraẽ alerta ijehegui reheguáva"" which translates to ""It is observed where the victim is located, to assess their condition and remain alert to their surroundings.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ejesareko escena rehe (Observe the scene):** While observing the scene is important, the passage emphasizes *where the victim is* within that scene and their condition.
* **B: Eñemoaguĩ ehóvo víctima rehe (Approach the victim):** The passage doesn't mention approaching the victim yet, just observing.
* **D: Eha'arõ pytyvõ (Offer help):** Offering help comes *after* assessing the situation and the victim's condition.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e nderejapóiva'era ejesareko hag̃ua víctima rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Ejesareko mba'écihapa opyta ra'e**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states: ""Ojesareko va'erã **mba'écihapa opyta ra'e** víctimia oñembojávo hese ha oĩmeraẽ alerta ijehegui reheguáva"" - which translates to ""One should observe **how the victim is positioned** when found, and whether they show signs of being alert.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ani ejepy'apy eñehungáramo:**  This means ""Don't rush."" While caution is important, the passage doesn't *primarily* focus on not rushing.
* **B: Ejesareko escena rehe tenonde víctima mboyve:** This means ""Observe the scene before approaching the victim.""  The passage mentions observing the scene, but the *focus* is on the victim's condition *when found*.
* **D: Ejesareko oĩmeraẽ alerta ijehegui reheguáva:** This means ""Observe if there's an alert about their health.""  This is *part* of what to observe, but not the primary thing.



"
Mba'e ñemoambue ojapóva Revolución Francesa ojapo efecto clase trabajadora ári?,"The correct answer is **C: Temimo'ã republicano ojejagarra** (The republican ideal was strengthened).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Revolución Francesa avei omongre’ỹ heta tapicha ohasa asýva-pe clase trabajadora ryepýpe tetã ambue rupigua oñepyrũ hag̃ua omongu’e revolución hetãme.""  This translates to ""The French Revolution also encouraged many people to move from the working class to other countries to start spreading the idea of revolution throughout the world.""  While it mentions the working class *moving* and spreading revolution, the key effect *within* France, as implied by the broader context of moving from absolutism to republicanism, is the strengthening of republican ideals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hetave pytyvõ tetãme (Greater help to the country):** The passage doesn't state that the revolution directly *helped* the country. It details effects *of* the revolution, not benefits.
* **B: Clase-gui jeva competencia-pe (Competition within classes):** The passage talks about class *movement* and military ranking, but not competition within classes as a direct result.
* **D: Sistema métrico pyahu (Improvement of the metric system):** While the passage mentions the metric system, it doesn't connect it to the effects on the working class.



"
"Revolución Francesa rire, militar ha ambuepe ohupyty hag̃ua ohekáva, mba'épe sa'ive ojejesareko?","The correct answer is **B: Clase rehe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Upéva oiko avei militar-kuéra apytépe ojejesareko **rãngue rupi clase rehe** oñeñemohenda hag̃ua ejercito-pe, ojejesareko cailaber rehe.""  This directly translates to ""This also happens with the military, competing **based on class** to organize themselves into the army, competing based on rank.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ojehupytýva'ekue rehe** - This means ""regarding their merits"" and isn't specifically mentioned in the context of how they compete.
*   **C: Vare’arekoveva** - This means ""those who are favored"" and isn't the basis of their competition.
*   **D: Cailaber rehe** - This means ""based on rank"" and while mentioned, it's *because* of class that they compete for rank. Class is the foundational competition.



"
Mba'e servicio público oje'e ndogustáiva umi tetãnguéra iñakarapu’ãvéva ryepýpe ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mba’yrumỹi público** (Public transportation).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses issues with ""mba’yrumỹi oñemohendáva"" (transportation being developed/planned) and how countries are struggling to provide good transportation (including buses/vai or bridges/puente).**  The question asks what public service these countries are dissatisfied with.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Y vai (The road)** - While roads are *part* of transportation, the passage is discussing the overall system, including buses and bridges.
    * **B: Puente mopu'ã (Good bridge)** - Bridges are only *one component* of the transportation issue.
    * **D: Tekombo'e (Health)** - The passage doesn't mention healthcare at all.



Therefore, **Mba’yrumỹi público (Public transportation)** best encompasses the concerns raised in the passage."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ikatu oje'e umi mba'yrumỹi ñemohenda rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Aimete opavave tapichakuéra oiporuva ipochyjoa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aimete opavave tapichakuéra ipochyjoa mba’yrumỹi oñemohedáva rehe."" (Everyone uses and benefits from roads.) This directly answers the question of what can be said about road construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mayma oporúva ohayhu:** (Everything is paid for) - The passage doesn't discuss funding.
* **B: Ndaha'éi ivaíva y-guaicha:** (It's not just a benefit for a few) - While the passage implies widespread benefit, it doesn't *directly* state this.  It focuses on *everyone* using roads.
* **D: Ha'e grati aimete opavave tetãnguéra iñakarapu’ãvéva ryepýpe:** (It's great that all the powerful countries in the world...) - This is about the countries involved, not the roads themselves.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hasyeterei ojejesareko porã hag̃ua tráfico ñemongu’e rehe..."" which translates to ""strategies are being developed to improve traffic management...""  The entire text is *about* traffic management – how to understand and improve the flow of traffic based on vehicle characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tráfico pya'ekue** (Traffic speed) - While speed is *a characteristic* used in traffic management, it's not what the strategies are focused on improving overall.
* **B: Ñembohape tapekuéra** (Road construction) - The passage doesn't focus on building roads, but managing traffic *on* those roads.
* **C: Tapekuéra tembiapo** (Driver activity) - Driver behavior is relevant, but the focus is on understanding traffic *flow* using vehicle characteristics, not directly controlling driver actions.



"
Máva ko'ã apytégui ojeiporu ojehechauka ha oñembopapapy hag̃ua trafico ñemongu'e?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapekuéra tembiapo (Road users' behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to improve traffic management and prediction, three characteristics are used:

1. **Ñemongu’e (Flow):**  How traffic is moving.
2. **Hetakue (Density):** How many vehicles are on the road.
3. **Ipya’ekue (Speed):**  How fast vehicles are traveling.

These characteristics help *drivers* (tapekuéra) understand and react to road conditions.  The entire purpose of analyzing these is to understand *how drivers behave* and therefore improve traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba’yrumỹi mboguatahakuéra rekoguata (Vehicle trajectories):** While vehicle trajectories are *data* used to *calculate* the characteristics, they aren't the core factor used for *showing* and *improving* traffic flow.
* **C: Tapekuéra jehai (Driver awareness):** Awareness is a *result* of good traffic management, not one of the foundational elements used to achieve it.
* **D: Tráfico hetakue (Traffic density):** Density is *one* of the characteristics, but it’s not the overall element used to show and improve traffic flow – flow, speed, and density *together* are.

Mba'e oiporu Hershey ha Chase omoĩ hag̃ua ADN? ,"La respuesta correcta es **A: Fósforo radiactivo**.

**Explicación:**

El texto indica claramente que Hershey y Chase usaron fósforo radiactivo para marcar el ADN del fago. El fósforo es un componente del ADN, pero no de las proteínas. Por lo tanto, al rastrear el fósforo radiactivo, pudieron determinar si el ADN, y no las proteínas, era el material genético que se transfería a las bacterias.

Las otras opciones son incorrectas porque:

*   **B: Material genético** es lo que estaban intentando identificar, no lo que usaron.
*   **C: Azufre radiactivo** se usó para marcar las proteínas, no el ADN.
*   **D: Virus** son los que usaron como vehículo para inyectar el material genético, no el material en sí mismo."
Mutación ohasa hag̃ua ñemoñare mba'e oikotevẽ?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi célula ha'éramo linea germinal rehegua** (Whether the cells are germline cells).

Here's why:

The passage states that mutations in *germline cells* are the ones that can be passed down to offspring. The question asks what needs to happen for a mutation to be inherited. Therefore, the cell type being a germline cell is the crucial factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojehechakuaava'erã material genético** (The genetic material is examined) - Examining the genetic material is *part of* identifying a mutation, but doesn't determine if it will be inherited.
* **C: Mba'eichagua mutación-pa** (What kind of mutation it is) - The type of mutation doesn't automatically mean it will be inherited.
* **D: Mutación-pa ikatu ojuka célula-pe** (The mutation can occur in the cell) -  Mutations occurring in somatic (non-germline) cells are not inherited; they might cause cancer but aren’t passed on.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e efecto-pa ndojapói mba'eve mutación rehe?","The correct answer is **D: Mba'éichaguapa mutación** (How the mutation occurs).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what effect is *not* discussed in the passage.** The passage details *that* mutations happen, *where* they happen (germline cells), *what* they can affect (offspring or cause cancer), and *that* the altered genetic material is studied.
* **It does *not* explicitly discuss *how* mutations happen – the mechanism or cause of the mutation itself.**  It only says a mutation *occurs*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mboýpa ha'e material genético ivaíva (What the altered genetic material is):** The passage *does* mention the altered genetic material is studied.
* **B: Umi celula-pa ha'e hína célula germinal (That the cells are germline cells):** The passage explicitly focuses on mutations in germline cells and their impact on offspring.
* **C: Ojehechakuaava'erã avei upe material genético ojeporútava (That the altered genetic material is also studied):** This is stated directly in the passage.



Therefore, **D** is the only effect *not* mentioned in the text."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ome'ẽ rupi so'o** (They provided meat) - While meat is mentioned, it's not the *initial* reason for domestication.
*   **B: Oipytyvõ pastoreo korapýpe** (They helped with small-scale herding) - The text describes larger-scale herding with shepherds and flocks.
*   **C: Ome'ẽ hikuái compañía** (They provided companionship) - Companionship is not mentioned as a reason for domestication in the text.

The text states: ""Ha'ãhára ombota sa'ivéva, te´rã swings club, ojapopa haguã upe embiapo ha'evéma."" This translates to ""Players hit the ball, or swing the club, to do this work.""  The action of *hitting* is what is done skillfully in golf.  ""Ñembota"" means ""to hit"" or ""impact.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pelota (ball)** - While the ball is *used* in golf, the skill isn't simply *having* a ball.
*   **C: Aravo (time)** - Time is not a skill in golf.
*   **D: Yvykua (course)** - The course is where golf is played, but not the skill itself.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ñembosarái oiko kapi'ipépe upe yvykua jerére ha héra **green**."" This directly translates to ""The game takes place on the surface of the field and it's called **green**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Papoapy yvykua** - This refers to the starting area, not where the game is *played* on generally.
* **C: Pe yvykua peteĩha** - This means ""the first field"" and isn't the general name for the playing surface.
* **D: Ñembosarái mbytéramõ** - This means ""the surroundings of the game"" and is too vague.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...peteĩ jehesa'ỹijo ojeiporu ojeipe'a hag̃ua peteĩ térã hetave hipótesis...""  This translates to ""...a research is used to propose one or more hypotheses...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojeiikuaa hag̃ua mba'échapa oiko arapy** (To find out how things happen) - While research *leads* to understanding how things happen, that isn't its primary *purpose* as described in the text.
* **C: Jeporandu hag̃ua** (To investigate) - Investigation is a *part* of research, but not the defining purpose stated in the text.
* **D: Ombohapéva científico rapereka** (To support scientific knowledge) -  Research contributes to scientific knowledge, but the text focuses on what research *does* – it proposes hypotheses.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...peteĩ jehesa'ỹijo ojeiporu ojeipe'a hag̃ua peteĩ térã hetave hipótesis..."" ( ""...a report is used to present one or more hypotheses..."")

The question asks what scientists rely on according to the text. The text explicitly says they rely on *reports* (jehesa'ỹijo) to present their hypotheses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Método científiko año** (The scientific method itself) - While the method is important, the text focuses on *what scientists use within* the method, not the method itself.
*   **B: Jehecha apo** (Data/observations) - Data is gathered *through* the method, but isn't the thing the scientists *rely on* to present their ideas.
*   **C: Jeipe'a hipótesis** (Presenting hypotheses) - Presenting a hypothesis is a *part* of the process, but the text says scientists rely on the *report* that contains the hypotheses.

* **The question asks:** What is NOT true about tornadoes based on the text?
* **Option C** directly contradicts the text - it states *all* tornadoes have large hail, when the text says only *two percent* do.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the text:

* **A:** ""Tornado ikatu omosarambi ojuhúva guive hapépe"" - The text *does* say tornadoes can appear suddenly.
* **B:** ""Tornado ho'akuaa peteĩ apu'a michĩvapente ambue tormenta-kuéra hatãva rovake"" -  The text states tornadoes form from severe thunderstorms.
* **D:** ""Peteĩva tornado ikatu oguereko yvytu ohupytykuaáva 300 milla por hora (300mph)"" - The text confirms some tornadoes have winds up to 300 mph.

"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva ko'ã techauka apytépe ha'e añete aimete opa tornado rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Hi'arekuaa hetave mbohapy aravógui**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the text states is *common* to most tornadoes. The text specifically says: ""Dos por ciento tornado hatãvéva hi'arekuaa hetave mbohapy aravógui"" which translates to ""Two percent of tornadoes are observed to last for more than an hour."" This is a characteristic shared by a significant portion of tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oguereko yvytu ohypyty kuaáva 480 milla por hora (480 mph)** -  This describes the *potential* wind speed of the strongest tornadoes, not a characteristic of *most* tornadoes.
* **C: Tornado ho'akuaa peteĩ apu'a tuichavévape ambue tormenta-kuéra hatãva rovake** - This describes *how* tornadoes form, not a common attribute.
* **D: Tornado-kuéra ohapo'o yvyramáta** - This states tornadoes touch the ground, which is true, but doesn’t distinguish them or define what's common among them.

* **A: Oiporu lente (They used lenses):** While they *used* lenses, the passage says they started making something *with* the lenses - the telescope.
* **B: Mbotuicha opa mba'e (They discovered everything):** This is far too broad and not what the passage discusses.
* **C: Ojapo lente (They made lenses):**  They had been using lenses, but the significant new development was *combining* them to make telescopes.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hakatu telescopio tee jejapo ñepyrũmby ojejapo Europa-pe siglo 16 opapotávo.""  This translates to ""However, the first telescopes were made in Europe from the 16th century onwards.""  Therefore, people started using lenses for better vision *from* the 16th century onwards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mil año pukukue** (A thousand years ago) - The text doesn't mention anything about a thousand years ago.
* **C: Hetaiterei arýma** (A long time ago) - Too vague. The text gives a specific timeframe.
* **D: Oñepyrũ guive siglo 16** (Starting in the 16th century) - While close, ""opapotávo"" (from/onwards) is more accurate as it implies continuous use *after* the 16th century began.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Oñeiméma aislado opavavégui"" (He was kept isolated from everyone) when the vision appeared to him. This is a direct statement about his condition during the experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Okapegua ñehendúva opytyvõ ñemoãngaguapy hag̃ua** (He began a journey to help with spiritual guidance) - While the overall story of Muhammad is about spiritual guidance, the passage *specifically* focuses on *this* vision and doesn't mention a journey starting *because* of it.
* **C: Ha'e sapy'ánte oĩse ha'eño** (He was always there) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ha'e ojehecha ha ojehendukase** (He was seen and heard) - The passage explicitly states the opposite - that no one saw him or knew he was there.  ""Jepéramo peteĩ oikuaa ha’e oĩha upépe"" (Even one didn’t know he was there).

The text states: ""...katu pe hierro ombyai pya'eve vagón rueda madera-kuéragui ojejapóva. Upéicha umi rueda madera-guigua oñembohekovia rueda de hierro rehe."" This translates to ""...but the iron was first applied to the wooden wagon wheels. Thus, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels.""

Therefore, the first use of iron was for the **wheels** of the wagons.

Here's why:

The text directly states: ""Upéicha umi rueda madera-guigua oñembohekovia rueda de hierro rehe. (Thus, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels.)""  It explains that the iron wore down the wooden wheels, leading to their replacement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Heta kavaju ipya'eve (Many horses were small):** The text doesn't relate wheel material to horse size.
* **B: Hembiapo porãve rupi (Due to better work):** The text focuses on the material change, not improved workmanship.
* **C: Hetave carga ogueropu'aka (They had a lot of cargo to carry):** While the wagonways were used for heavy loads, the text doesn't link this to the wheel change. The reason for the change is the wear and tear caused by the iron.

The passage explicitly states: ""Romanticismo ryepýpe, **geografía omboheko tapichakuérape**..."" which translates to ""In the heart of Romanticism, **geography shapes people...**"" 

The passage directly links Romanticism to the influence of geography on individuals and their destinies.  The other options are not mentioned in this context:

*   **Léikuéra (Laws):** While the passage mentions laws related to societal structure, it states geography *influences* how those laws are developed, not that laws themselves directly shape people in Romanticism.
*   **Jepokuaa (Knowledge):**  Not a central theme in the provided text.
*   **Teko (Character/Destiny):** While destiny is *a result* of the geographical influence, geography itself is the direct influence.

Upévare he’ise: ""Arco yvy gotyo ipu hatãve aja."" (The ""arco yvy gotyo"" only appears at the end).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mbopu vevyive** - This refers to the ""arco yvate gotyo"" which *does* have a bow.
*   **B: Marca ojoguáva grapa-pe** - This describes the shape of the ""arco yvy gotyo"" but doesn't relate to whether you bow it.
*   **D: Ñepyrũ rana guive** - This describes how the ""arco yvy gotyo"" is used (like a frog) but not whether you bow it.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã apytépe ojoja ñembopu vevuive ndive?","The correct answer is **A: Arco yvy gotyo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arco yvate gotyo katuete ombopu vevuive, arco yvy gotyo ipu hatãve aja."" This translates to ""Arco yvate gotyo *does* have a bow, but arco yvy gotyo does not.""  The question asks which of the options is shown to have a bow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Arco ñembosyryry** - The text doesn't specify which arco is ""ñembosyryry"" (decorated).
* **C: Marca ojoguáva peteĩ V-pe** - While the text mentions a ""V"" shape, it's describing *arco yvate gotyo*, not a general marker.
* **D: Ñepyrũ arco jajokoha ñande pópe** - This describes the beginning of playing the *arco yvy gotyo* but doesn't relate to whether it has a bow.

Kanguekue ohechauka po ojeadaptava'ekue ojeiporu hag̃ua mba'erã?,"The correct answer is **D: Jeguata nudillo ári**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ohechaukáva po jeiporu oñemoĩ haguã pohyuikue jeguata haguã **nudillo ári**."" This directly translates to ""...it shows that the foot was adapted to put weight on the ground **towards the knuckles**.""  This indicates the adaptation was for walking/standing on knuckles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mba'ejokópe:**  Means ""nothing,"" which isn't what the passage describes.
* **B: Oñemoĩ hagua pohyuikue:** Means ""to put weight,"" but doesn't specify *how* the weight was distributed.
* **C: Jeguata:** Means ""on the ground,"" also doesn't detail *how* the foot adapted.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui ohechauka porã ka'i po kangue? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ojeiporu oñemoĩ hag̃ua pohyuikue**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ohechaukáva po jeiporu oñemoĩ haguã pohyuikue jeguata haguã nudillo ári."" This directly translates to ""it shows that the large toe is used to put weight on it to walk on the knuckles.""  This describes the function of the toe – being *used to support weight*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikarẽ’ỹve peteĩ avagui:** (A single curve) - The passage doesn't focus on the shape of the toe, but its function.
* **B: Ipo ha ipy ndojojoguái tuichakuépe:** (The toe and foot don't touch the ground) -  The passage *describes* how the toe *does* touch the ground (on the knuckles).
* **D: Ojeiporu mba'ejoko g̃uarã:** (Used for a specific purpose) - While true that it's used for a purpose, option C is a *more specific and accurate* description of that purpose as detailed in the passage.



"
Jeiporavo ombogue ñemoambue mutación pyahu mba'e atýgui?,"The correct answer is **A: Oñemi**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What replaces the original trait due to a new mutation?
* **The passage states:** ""Mutación omoĩ peteĩ ñemoambue pyahu, ha jeiporavo ombogue ñemoambue ojehechaukáva atýgui.""  (Mutation provides a new trait, and *it replaces* the observed trait.)
* **Oñemi** directly translates to ""mutation"" in this context, and the passage explicitly links mutation to replacing the original trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Recombinación (Recombination):**  Recombination *creates* new combinations of traits, but doesn't directly replace an original trait with a new one caused by mutation.
* **C: Segregación (Segregation):** Segregation separates traits during reproduction, it doesn't replace them.
* **D: Ohechaukáva (Observed):** This refers to the trait that *is* being observed, not what replaces it.



"
Mba'e proceso ha'e responsable omoĩ haguére ñemoambue mutación?,"The correct answer is **C: Mutación**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the process *responsible for creating* new variations (mutations).** The passage specifically states: ""**Mutación omoĩ peteĩ ñemoambue pyahu**"" which translates to ""**Mutation introduces a new variation**"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Segregación (Segregation):**  Segregation and recombination *shuffle* existing variations, they don't *create* new ones.  The passage says they move variations from one generation to the next.
* **B: Recombinación (Recombination):** Similar to segregation, recombination mixes up existing genetic material.
* **D: Ohechaukáva (Observed):** This refers to the observed traits, not the process that creates variation.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ho'uva'erã ka'i orekóramo problema proteína rehegua?","The correct answer is **C: Saltamonte**.

Here's why:

The passage states that insects (tahýi, kupi'i, tupi'águi - meaning grasshoppers, crickets, and caterpillars) are a good source of protein and contain all the necessary amino acids, and were likely part of our ancestors' diet.  It contrasts this with the difficulty primates (like us) have digesting plant proteins fully.  The passage implies our ancestors *did* solve the protein problem by eating insects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hogue manóva** - This means ""it doesn't exist"" which is false - the passage discusses how ancestors *did* find solutions.
* **B: Legumbre** - The passage states that while legumes *have* protein, primates have trouble digesting them efficiently.
* **D: Yvoty ra'ỹi** - This translates to ""fruit,"" and the passage doesn't suggest fruit solved the protein problem.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã apytépe ndaha'éi aminoácido ñeikotevẽ rupi?","The correct answer is **A: Jedigeri asy**.

Here's why:

The passage states the animal in question (likely a primate) has a digestive system that struggles to get *enough* amino acids from plant sources.  The passage explicitly says they don't digest legumes well, despite them containing protein. The passage is discussing a deficiency in amino acid intake.  ""Jedigeri asy"" (difficulty digesting) directly relates to the problem of not getting enough amino acids.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Desnutrición (Malnutrition):** While malnutrition is a *consequence* of not getting enough amino acids, it's not the *reason* they can't get the amino acids in the first place.
* **C: Depresión jekakuaa (Emotional depression):**  Depression is also a consequence mentioned, not the primary issue.
* **D: Ñemano (Sickness/Illness):** Sickness is a general consequence; the core problem is the difficulty in digesting and obtaining necessary amino acids.

* **The passage states:** ""Peteĩ subcultura atyguakuéra jepivéramo ohechauka upepeguaha peteĩ mba'e jeiporu iñambue ha simbólico-va estilo-gui, oikehápe moda, manierismo-kuéra ha argot."" (When a group belongs to a subculture, it shows its belonging through a unique and symbolic style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñeha'ã ojehe'a** (They try to imitate) - Subcultures are about *difference*, not imitation.
* **B: Ojagarra jerovia ijererehegua** (They reject traditional religion) - While some subcultures might reject traditional religion, it's not a defining characteristic of *all* subcultures. The passage mentions religion as a *possible* defining factor, not a universal one.
* **C: Omoñei estándar social-kuéra** (They follow social standards) - Subcultures actively *challenge* or deviate from social standards, as stated in the first sentence.

"Ko mba’ekuaarã he’iháicha oñeme’ẽva ko maranduhaipe, mba'e ikatu oiko peteĩ mitã oikuaáva peteĩ raza sa'ivevaguaha ha orekóva estereotipo comportamiento rehegua?","The correct answer is **A: Pe mitã oñeha'ãta ojecomporta hag̃ua (The child tries to behave)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Children *imitate* racial consciousness and racial stereotypes, and these stereotypes influence behavior.  This means a child, even if raised without explicit prejudice, will *attempt* to act in ways they perceive as aligned with those stereotypes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe mitã ndojecomportamo'ãi (The child does not behave):** This contradicts the passage, which clearly states imitation of behavior.
* **C: Pe mitã ojehekýita situación social-gui (The child adapts to the social situation):** While adaptation is a factor, the passage emphasizes the *internalization and imitation* of stereotypes as the primary driver, not just general social adaptation.
* **D: Pe mitã ndojehe'asemõái umi raza sa'ivévandi (The child does not identify with different races):**  The passage doesn't say the child *identifies* with other races, it says they *imitate* behaviors associated with them.  Imitation doesn't require identification.



Therefore, option A best reflects the core idea of the passage: children will *try* to behave according to the stereotypes they observe."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, peteĩ mitã oikuaaramo estereotipo raza rehegua, mba'épe ikatu oreko impacto?","The best answer is **C: Heko ambue mitãndive** (Impact on how he/she interacts with other children).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how stereotypes *influence behavior*.**  The core idea is that children learn stereotypes and those stereotypes then affect how they act.
* **Option C directly addresses behavioral impact.**  If a child learns a stereotype, it will likely affect how they treat or perceive children of that race.
* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: Ha'e oporavo mba'e raza sa'ivevaguahapa ha'e (It changes what race he/she believes in):** This isn't the focus. The child isn't changing *their own* racial identity, they are adopting a prejudiced view of *another* race.
    * **B: Heko (Health):** Stereotypes don't directly impact physical health.  While prejudice can contribute to stress, the passage isn't about that.
    * **D: Mba'épa he'ise chupe raza (What it means to him/her to be of that race):** The passage is about *perceptions of other races*, not the child's own racial identity.



Therefore, **C** most accurately reflects the impact of learning racial stereotypes as described in the text."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ndaha'eichéne ojoajúva omongakuaávo peteĩ mitã salvaje-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Oiko ijeheguíntema (They live with their mothers)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ambue mitã salvaje-va ojegueraha mombyry (itúva térã isyvoi jepi); ambue jey, ko mitã jehejarei oiko túva térã sy ombotove rupi chupekuéra oreko rupi upe mitã deterioro iñakame térã hetépe."" This translates to: ""Some 'feral' children are found with their mothers (either their mother or father); others, this child is found living with their mother or father, with the child having deterioration in their mind or body.""

This means a key characteristic of some ""feral"" children is *living with* (even if a deteriorated relationship exists) their mothers.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Iñe'ekuaa (They don't speak):** While the text describes deterioration, it doesn't specifically state they don't speak.
*   **C: Tendencia ha'eño (It's a tendency):** The text describes *cases*, not a general tendency.
*   **D: Ansiedad social (Social anxiety):** The text describes a *lack* of socialization, not anxiety specifically.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e añete mitã salvaje comportamiento rehe?","The correct answer is **D: Comportamiento salvaje oiko orekogui tuicha deterioro iñakã rupigui**.

This directly translates to ""Wild children can result from abuse or childhood trauma or being abandoned...otherwise, this child's behavior exists with their mother or father, with them having that child's worsening or extreme deterioration.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aimete opavave comportamiento oiko deterioro hetépe rupi** (All behavior exists with extreme deterioration) - Too broad; the passage focuses specifically on *wild* children.
* **B: Comportamiento salvaje ikatu ha’e sa’i socialización rupive** (Wild behavior can be due to a lack of socialization) - While lack of socialization is *mentioned* as a cause, it's not the defining characteristic described for *all* ""wild"" children.
* **C: Comportamiento salvaje oiko mitã ojegueraha mombyry rupi** (Wild behavior exists with children abandoned by their parents) - This is *one* scenario mentioned, but not the only one.  The passage also mentions abuse and trauma.

Here's why:

The text states that the agriculture being discussed *is* intended to produce food to feed people and livestock.  Options B, C, and D describe *methods* used within that agriculture (making food, using techniques, using native seeds), but they aren't the *purpose* of the agriculture itself.  Option A directly states the purpose - to produce food for people and animals.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Agricultura ojeikove haguã hína peteĩ sistema ndahasýiva, jepivérõ orgánico, oiporúva semilla nativa upe tenda jerepeguáva ha **oñemoambuéva ñemitỹ jere térã ambue técnica hasy'ỹva omobarete haguã ojehupytýva.**"" (Sustainable agriculture is a non-conventional system, even organic, using native seeds appropriate for the land and **employing efficient techniques or other advanced methods to ensure productivity.**)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha'e sistema orgánico paite** (It is only an organic system) - While it *can* be organic, the passage says it's *even* organic, implying it's not *exclusively* organic.
* **C: Oipytyvõ umi ñemitỹhárape omboja'o hag̃ua ñemitỹ opa tavapehẽ ndive** (It helps farmers to share seeds with everyone) - The passage doesn't focus on seed sharing.
* **D: Ñemitỹhára oiporu gueteri heta tetã ojeguerojerávape** (Farmers use things from many countries that are being exported) - The passage mentions farmers live in many countries, but not that they *use* things from those countries.



"
"Museope jeho, mba'e tendápe ho'ata?","The correct answer is **C: Turismo cultural**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly defines ""turismo kuaapyrã"" (tourism with a purpose) as focusing on understanding the history and culture of a place.**  The question asks about museums, which are *inherently* focused on history and culture.
* **Turismo recreativo** (recreational tourism) is described as camping and staying in tents for enjoyment, not specifically for learning.
* **Turismo negocio-gua** (business tourism) isn't mentioned in relation to museums in the passage.
* **Turismo okapegua** (adventure tourism) focuses on exploring natural areas, which isn't the primary function of a museum.

Therefore, a museum aligns directly with the description of *turismo cultural*.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ikatu ha'e mba'e tuichave turista recreativo-pe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **A: Oikevo hikuái cultura local-pe** (It focuses on local culture).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Turismo jepytu'urãva... ojeikuaa haguã hembiasa ha cultura oguerekóva"" (Recreational tourism... aims to learn about the customs and culture).  This directly links recreational tourism to an interest in local culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jeho peteĩ tendápe iñambuéva oikohaguo jepytu'u hag̃ua** (Going to a place to stay to have fun) - This describes *all* tourism, not specifically recreational tourism.
* **C: Tenda tetã ryepýpe importanteva jehecha** (Important places to see in a country) - This describes sightseeing, which is a component of tourism but doesn't define recreational tourism.
* **D: Pe tenda rembiasa jeikuaa** (Knowing the interesting place) - This is too general and doesn't pinpoint what makes recreational tourism distinct.

The passage states: ""Oñemandu’ava’erã ambue guare ñemureko rembiasa ha mba’e osẽ porãva’ekue oipytyvõ tapichakuérape oipykúivo tape pyahu ha mba’epyahu tupãope g̃uarã."" This directly translates to ""New ways of thinking and what comes out well will help people navigate the difficult and stormy path.""  This is the passage's explicit answer to how people can avoid falling into the abyss.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jeikuaa tapicha rerakuéra ojejava'ekue aty rekohápe** - While the passage mentions learning from others' experiences, it doesn't say this *prevents* falling into the abyss. It's about understanding, not prevention.
* **C: Jejuhu aty omboguata ha omombaretéva** -  Having a mission and a supportive community is positive, but the passage doesn't present this *as* the way to avoid the abyss.
* **D: Jeikuaa aty rembiasa** - Knowing the past is helpful, but the passage emphasizes *new* ways of thinking, not just knowing the old ones.

The passage states: ""...hakatu oipytyvõ tapichakuérape oĩ oikuaa hag̃ua moõpa hína aty rembiasa ryepýpe."" ( ""...but it helps people understand where they are within the larger story."") This directly addresses how understanding our story helps us.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndojekyhyjevéi rupi ñemoambuégui** (Not through emotional struggle) - While the passage mentions struggle, it doesn't say *how* understanding our story is helped.
* **B: Oĩ porãva ñemombarete** (Good protection) - This is mentioned as a result of a strong mission and community, but not *how* we understand our story.
* **D: Ñemureko rembiasa porãve** (A good story of recovery) - This is a broader concept discussed in the passage, but doesn't specifically address how we *understand* our story.

"Ko'ãva apytépe, mávapa ha’e hina umi enfoque posmoderno añetegua ñemoarandurã hag̃ua?","The correct answer is **B: Ñemoarandu oikova'erã umi mba'e jaguerovíava oikotaha ñanderehe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a fragmented, personal, and experience-based approach to learning.**  It highlights how learning comes from random TV shows (home improvement, DIY, documentaries) and everyday experiences (remembering childhood homes, wanting to travel). This aligns directly with postmodern thought, which rejects grand narratives and emphasizes the subjective nature of knowledge and its construction through individual experiences.  The learning isn't structured or guided by a central authority; it *emerges* from the things one encounters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ experiencia ñemoarandu rehegua ikatu iporãve ambuegui** (A learning experience can be good for someone else) - This is a general statement and doesn't capture the *specific* characteristics of a postmodern approach to learning.
* **C: Peteĩ tape ñemoarandu hag̃ua ikatu iporãve ambuegui** (A path to learning can be good for someone else) - Similar to A, it's too broad.
* **D: Ñemoarandupe ndaipóri peteĩ tape año** (There is no single path to learning) - While true in a postmodern sense, this doesn't articulate *how* learning happens according to the passage – the emphasis on fragmented, personal experiences.



Therefore, option B best encapsulates the core idea of the text, which is that learning is built from the fragments of what surrounds us and what we individually experience."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ñemoarandu ningo oñemboheko hína pe experiencia ohasáva temimbo’e kuaapy ojehechaukava kuápe."" (Learning is built on the experiences we have with the media we consume.) This is a core tenet of a postmodern approach to learning – that knowledge isn't objective or pre-defined, but constructed through individual experience and interpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Heta hendáicha ikatu eñemoarandu:** (Many ways to learn) While true, this doesn't specifically relate to the *postmodern* focus described in the text.
* **B: Oĩ experiencia ñemoarandurã iñimportanteveva ambuegui:** (There are important learning experiences other than these)  The passage doesn't deny other experiences, it *highlights* the importance of the media experiences discussed.
* **D: Ndajaiporumo'áiro jepe kuaapy iporã avei ñañemoarandu:** (We don't care even if the media is good, we still learn) This doesn't fully capture the nuance; the passage implies learning *happens* through media, regardless of its quality, but doesn't necessarily mean it's intentionally sought.

"Jepái rire ijehegui ojeke aja, mávapa ko'ã apytépe oñemombytéta jeke interrupción ndive?","The correct answer is **B: Jahuha jeho ha upéi eñeno jey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes waking up, feeling groggy (10-60 minutes), and then eventually feeling fully awake.** Option B directly reflects this: ""Jahuha jeho ha upéi eñeno jey"" translates to ""Wake up groggy and then fall back asleep"" which accurately describes the initial state after waking up with sleep inertia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemoñe'ẽ peteĩ aravo mbyte peve eke mboyve jey** (Set an alarm an hour before waking up) - The passage doesn't mention setting alarms an hour earlier.
* **C: Embogueramo alarma nde rupa ykére ha eke jey mokõipa aravo'i rire** (Put an alarm near your head and fall back asleep after two minutes) -  The passage suggests trying to get up after waking, not intentionally falling back asleep.
* **D: Epu'ã hey'u y peteĩ limétagui oĩva nde rupa ykére** (Drink water with a lemon near your head) - This is not mentioned in the passage at all.

Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndaha'éi añete jeke interrupción rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojesarekóva biorritmo-kuéra rehe**.

The passage states: ""Ambue poravorã ojesarekóva biorritmo-kuéra rehe hína jey'u heta (y, te, peteĩ diurético ojeikuaáva) ojeke mboyve, ojapóva ojekuary haguã.""  This translates to: ""Another recommendation related to biorhythms is to drink a lot (yes, even a diuretic) before, to help you wake up.""

The question asks what *isn't* a characteristic of the interrupted sleep described. The passage clearly indicates that using strategies related to biorhythms is a recommendation *in addition to* the interrupted sleep, not a defining feature *of* the interruption itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndohekái ndemombay'etevõ:** This means ""It doesn't prevent oversleeping"" - the text *implies* it helps prevent oversleeping by using an alarm.
* **C: Jepái ijehegui ojeke aja:** This means ""Drinking a cup of coffee"" - this *is* a characteristic of the interruption.
* **D: Ojepayrire ojeheka eke jeyrõ mokõi aravo ohasa mboyve rupi:** This means ""Waking up and looking at the clock again after two hours"" - this *is* a characteristic of the interruption.

* The passage then elaborates on what happens *during* this REM state period and how it relates to vivid dreams and later recall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbovy REM estado** -  ""Mbovy"" means ""only"" - the passage doesn't say *only* REM state.
* **B: Kyre'ỹ** - ""Kyre'ỹ"" means ""dreams"" - While related, the passage focuses on the *period* of REM sleep where dreams happen, not just the dreams themselves.
* **C: Tete ñemyatyrõ pukukue** - ""Tete ñemyatyrõ pukukue"" means ""eye movements"" - These are a *characteristic* of REM sleep, but not the period itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ko fenómeno oikove hína umi tembiapokue ñanemandu'avéva oiko REM estado periodo aja."" (This phenomenon occurs with activities that deprive us of REM sleep.) and ""SA'ivéramo REM pyharépe, ko estado ojeguerekohápe jekete ha tete oñemyatyrõ oiko sa'ive ohóvo oiko haguãicha chugui peteĩ apañuái."" (When REM sleep is restricted, this state is characterized by intense and vivid dreams, as if trying to catch up on lost sleep). This describes REM rebound - the tendency to experience more REM sleep after being deprived of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sa'i REM estado periodo** (Little REM sleep period) - The passage discusses *deprivation* and *rebound*, not simply a little REM sleep.
* **C: Dependencia kerayvotý rehe** (Dependence on dreams) - While dreams are involved, the passage focuses on the physiological response to sleep deprivation, not a dependence on dreaming itself.
* **D: Hetave REM pyharekue** (Having REM sleep) -  This is too general. The passage isn't just about having REM sleep, but the *increased* REM sleep that follows deprivation.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'éichapa umi aty convencional ha internet-pegua ojojogua?","The correct answer is **B: Mokõivéva oreko autonomía iñambueva** (Both have different autonomy).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Py’ỹínte oguerekove autonomía umi atypegua convencional-gui..."" which translates to ""The internet teams have autonomy different from the conventional teams...""  This is the key difference highlighted in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokõivéva oreko estándar excelencia reheguáva** (Both have standards of excellence) - The text says they *both* have standards of excellence, but this isn't the *difference* between them. It's a similarity.
* **C: Mokõivéva oreko ojekuaa'ỹva tembiapoñemongu’erã** (Both have a known work organization) - The passage mentions ""Aty ojekuaa’ỹva"" as a type of team, but doesn't say both conventional and internet teams have it.
* **D: Mokõivéva oreko aravo ojojáva** (Both have a meeting time) - The text doesn't mention anything about meeting times as a point of comparison.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndorekói jokuaa umi aty convencional ha internet-pegua ndive?","The correct answer is **B: Aty internet-pegua py’ỹinte ha’e upe punto ojokupytyhápe aty convencional-pegua.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi aty intenet-pegua py’ỹinte ha’e upe punto ojokupytyhápe aty convencional-pe g̃uarã."" This directly translates to ""The strength of internet-based teams is the point of connection with conventional teams.""  This highlights the key difference – internet teams *derive* their strength from their connection to, and often build upon, conventional teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aty convencional ogureko estándar ijyvatevea** – While true according to the text, this doesn't explain the *difference* between the two types of teams. It's a characteristic of conventional teams, not a distinction.
* **C: Aty convencional oreko sa'ive autonomía aty internet-peguagui** – The text says internet teams have more autonomy *from* conventional teams, not the other way around.
* **D: Aty internet-pegua ikatu ijaty opa aravópe** – This is a characteristic mentioned, but not the key differentiating factor explained in the passage.



"
"Ko'ã apytépe, mávapa ndaha'éi hína peteĩ mba’e contenido teoría oguapyha?","The correct answer is **C: Temikotevẽ imba’evavoi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the content theories explain *what* motivates people, and that these theories suggest people have needs (temikotevẽ) that must be met or that they are trying to satisfy to move towards fulfillment. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Temikotevẽ pyahu oñemombaretevéva okakuaapáma arýpe** - This refers to the *result* of motivation (reaching a goal), not the core concept of what drives it.
*   **B: Mba’éichapa peteĩ jere ohekojopýta ejapo térã ejapo’ỹ hag̃ua ambue mba’e** - This describes a *mechanism* related to motivation, not the theory itself.
*   **D: Jeikuaa mba'épa tapichakuéra oñeñandu hag̃ua atraído** - This is a general statement about attraction, not specifically about content theories of motivation.

"Ko'ã apytépe, mávapa ndaha'éi tercio mbojojaha rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Omoheñói tekove ha kyre'ỹ ta’ãnga guive** (It shows life and strength in the composition).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes *tercio mbojojaha* as giving dynamism and helping a composition.**  It specifically mentions how it uses vertical and horizontal lines to achieve this.
* **Option B** directly relates to the *effect* of *tercio mbojojaha* – creating a feeling of life and strength within the artwork.  This aligns with the ""dinamismo"" (dynamism) mentioned in the passage.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ejapo peteĩ línea base pe tenda ikatuhápe oñemohenda pe sujeto** (Make a baseline on the canvas to center the subject) - While a baseline *can* be part of composition, it's not specifically what *tercio mbojojaha* is about.
    * **C: Ojapo tenda mba’e oguenohẽséva renda iporãvévaha’eha** (Make something on the canvas that helps it look beautiful) - This is too vague.  It doesn't describe the *method* of *tercio mbojojaha*.
    * **D: Omboheko ta'ãnga** (It supports the composition) - This is true, but it's too general. The passage is looking for *how* it supports the composition, not just that it *does*.

Therefore, **B** is the best answer because it describes the qualitative effect the *tercio mbojojaha* technique has on the artwork—bringing it to life and adding strength.



"
Mávapa ndaha'éi formato de fotografía 35mm rehegua?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndojejoguái heta formato común ndive relación de aspecto-re**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Heta formato común (formato aty APS techapyrã) ojuehegua térã ojojogua relación de aspecto orekóva rupive."" This translates to ""Many common formats (like the APS format family) either match or are based on the aspect ratio it has."" This directly implies that 35mm *influences* other formats through its aspect ratio.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojeiporu gueteri ko’ág̃a peve:**  (""It is still used today"") - While true, this doesn't define *what* 35mm format is.
* **B: Heko ojeiporu avei ko’ág̃a umi cámara digital formato-pe:** (""It is also used in digital cameras with image sensor formats"") - This describes an application of the format, not the format itself.
* **D: Ha'e formato de fotografía de imágenes fijas ojeikuaavéva arapýpe:** (""It is a photographic format for still images originally in 35mm"") - This is a *description* of the format, not something that makes it *different* or *not* what it is.

Therefore, option C best answers the question by explaining how 35mm format relates to (and influences) other formats.

El texto dice explícitamente que los objetivos zoom pueden replicar las imágenes que se obtienen con objetivos de distancia focal fija.  Las otras opciones son incorrectas:

* **A: Lente ipya'eve** - El texto indica que los zoom suelen tener aperturas máximas más pequeñas.
* **B: Ndahasýi jeporu hesakãpora’ỹhápe** - El texto dice lo contrario, que requieren más flash.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Misticismo ikatu ojehecha ambue hendaichagua jeroviapy ha iñemomorãramo omomba’eve rehe pe experiencia personal ojeguerekóva peteĩ estado de conciencia ipeteĩva rehe..."" (Mysticism can be seen as comparable to other interpretations and focusing on remembering the personal experience of a unique state of consciousness...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While it mentions altered states of consciousness, it's *part* of the definition, not what distinguishes it as a subject for study.
* **B:** This describes a core *aspect* of mysticism (conscious knowledge of the ultimate reality), but doesn't explain *how* it's studied or approached.
* **C:** This describes what a believer *sees* through mysticism, not the way it's approached as a topic of exploration.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Misticismo ikatu ojehecha ambue hendaichagua jeroviapy ha iñemomorãramo omomba’eve rehe pe experiencia personal ojeguerekóva peteĩ estado de conciencia ipeteĩva rehe, ko’ýte umi heko py’aguapyvéva, hembihechakuaa, ivy’a pypukukuaáva rehe.""  This directly describes mysticism as involving a distinct state of consciousness with altered perceptions and feelings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oheka realidad divina (Seeing the divine reality):** While seeing the divine reality *can* be part of a mystical experience, the text describes mysticism as the *process* of reaching that experience, not simply the vision itself.
* **B: Oheka jehechakuaa atýpe (Seeing with different eyes):**  This is too vague and doesn't capture the core of mystical experience as described in the text.
* **D: Conocimiento consciente Dios jeheka rehe (Conscious knowledge about God):** The text emphasizes *direct experience* rather than intellectual knowledge about God.  Mysticism isn't just knowing *about* the divine, it's *experiencing* it.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ikatu omoñepyrũ raka'e ñemitỹregua aty?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori Islas Chatham-gua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""oĩ jeikuaa pyahu he’íva umi Moriori ha’ehague peteĩ maoríes aty continente-pegua ohova’ekue Nueva Zelanda-gui Islas Chatham-pe"" which translates to ""there is knowledge suggesting the Moriori were a group of Maori from the continent who moved from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands.""

Therefore, the text directly indicates the Moriori originated as a group that settled on the Chatham Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriori Nueva Zelanda-gua** - The text suggests they *left* New Zealand, not originated there as a distinct group.
*   **C: Pueblo maori Polinesia-gua** - While the Maori came from Polynesia, the question asks about the origin of the *ñemitỹregua aty* (settled group), which is specifically the Moriori.
*   **D: Maoríes aty continente-pegua** - This is part of the theory about the Moriori's origin, but the question is asking *where* they settled and formed a group.

This translates to: ""In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the people of New Zealand, the Māori people, were the ones who killed the large birds called moas.""

Therefore, the people who killed the moas were from **New Zealand**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Carpeta ojapose hetave pliegue ohovo** (The folder is made of many folds) - While origami *involves* folds, the passage doesn't say the *folder itself* is made of folds. It says the origami technique was used to *improve* the folder.
* **C: Carpeta ojapo origami pliegue ypy gotyogua oikotevẽva** (The folder makes origami folds like a small flower necessary) - The passage mentions ""pliegue ypy gotyoguáicha"" as a *characteristic of origami*, not something the folder *requires*.
* **D: Carpeta oha'ãva'ekue peteĩ téra mokõi vece ramo** (The folder serves one or two purposes) -  The passage highlights practicality and recognition, not a limited number of functions.

Mávapa ndaha'éi añete origami yvy tee rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha'e umi hembiasa porãvape g̃uarã** (It is for better folding/making things easier to fold).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ojapo va'ekue Jonh Smith 1970 década-pe oipytyvõ haguã carpeta hembiasa'ỹva térã omyikuaa porã'ỹvape."" (It was created by Jonh Smith in the 1970s to help with easier folding or better recognition.) This directly links the origami base to improved folding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndoikotevẽi pliegue ypy gotyogua** (It doesn't need a small fold) - The passage *mentions* a small fold, it doesn't say it's unnecessary.
* **C: Opa pliegue oguereko tenda ndahasýiva** (Every fold has a hidden meaning) - While origami can be artistic, the passage focuses on its *functional* purpose of making folding easier, not its symbolic meaning.
* **D: Omacha carpeta omyikuaa porã'ỹvape g̃uarã** (It makes the carpet easier to recognize) - This is a misinterpretation of the text. It refers to *folding* not recognizing carpets.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva ko'ã tenda apytépe ndojehe'ái Valle del Indio civilización rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ambue ohenóiva chupe civilización Harappa, upeicha héra rupi tenda ojejo’o ypyhague 1920 década-pe."" This translates to ""...another name given to this civilization is Harappa, by which name the sites were known in the 1920s.""  Therefore, Harappa is a name *for* the Indus Valley civilization, not something separate from it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Río Sarasvati:** The text mentions a debate about the civilization also existing near the Sarasvati river, but doesn't state it's a name *for* the civilization itself.
*   **C: Opa región noreste Afganistán-pe:** This is a *location* where the civilization extended, not a name for it.
*   **D: Ko’ág̃a oĩha Pakistán tuichakue:**  This is also a *location* of the civilization, not a name.

This means ""Valle del Indo-pegua civilización"" is the original name, with ""Indo-Sarasvati"" and ""Harappa"" being alternative names discovered later.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Civilización Harappa:**  The text says Harappa is *a name given to it* (the civilization) later, not the original name.
* **B: Civilización Indo-Sarasvati:** This is also a later proposed name based on the belief the civilization existed along the Sarasvati river as well.
* **C: Civilización Río Indo:** While the civilization *developed* along the Indus River, this isn't the specific name used to identify it.

""Ñamba'apo oñondivepa"" translates to ""our work on the journey/path.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nde eipotávante emomba'eguasuve** -  This means ""If you say so, I believe you"" - irrelevant to the passage's meaning.
* **C: Hechakuaave mba'épa sa'iveháva oikotevẽ, opavave rãngue** - This means ""Everyone needs to know what is right, including everyone"" - a philosophical statement not connected to the passage.
* **D: Mba'epotarasa ikatu omacha** - This means ""What doesn't matter can be forgotten"" -  completely unrelated to the benefits of companionship.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes someone who prioritizes the well-being of others (even strangers) and is willing to help them improve their lives.** This is the core definition of altruism.  They are willing to act for the benefit of others, even at a potential cost to themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Jecolabora (Collaborative):** While collaboration is good, it doesn't necessarily capture the selfless aspect of helping someone improve their life, especially a stranger. Collaboration implies a mutual benefit.
* **C: Ñemba'apo oñondive (Work for others):**  This is a broad term and doesn't necessarily imply the *motivation* behind the work – it could be for payment, etc.
* **D: Peteĩmembánte (Member):**  This simply refers to being part of a group and doesn't relate to the act of selflessly helping others.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ohepyme'ẽ hetaiterei ñorairõ-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Wall Street casa bancaria** (Wall Street banks).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the loans taken by the Philippines to fund the war ended up benefiting Wall Street banks, essentially putting the Philippines in debt *to* those banks.  The passage directly links the financial burden of the war to these banks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Filipinas retä rekuái:** While the Philippines was the country regaining itself, it wasn't *providing* help to the war effort; it was *receiving* loans that caused problems.
* **C: Estados Unidos régimen colonial:** The US colonial regime *imposed* the system, but didn't directly *provide* financial assistance in a helpful way. It was the mechanism through which the debt was created.
* **D: Filipinas retãyguakuéra:** The Filipino people were the ones being harmed by the consequences of the war and debt, not offering help.



"
Mba'e periodo oú raka'e Templario-kuéra época mboyve?,"The correct answer is **C: Temprana Edad Media**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alta Edad Media mboyve oĩ kuri Temprana Edad Media..."" which translates to ""Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages...""  Since the Templars arose *during* the High Middle Ages (siglos XI, XII y XIII), the period *before* their time was the Early Middle Ages (Temprana Edad Media).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Baja Edad Media (Late Middle Ages)** - This came *after* the High Middle Ages, not before.
*   **B: Siglo XII (12th Century)** - This is a time *within* the High Middle Ages, when the Templars existed.
*   **D: Siglo XIII (13th Century)** - This is also a time *within* the High Middle Ages, when the Templars existed.



"
Mba'e periodo tepa oú Templario-kuéra época rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Baja Edad Media**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Templars existed during the Alta Edad Media (roughly 1000-1300 AD). It then clarifies that *after* the Alta Edad Media comes the Baja Edad Media. Therefore, the period *following* the Templars' time is the Baja Edad Media.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Siglo XII:** The Templars existed *during* the 12th century, not after it.
*   **C: Alta Edad Media:** The Templars existed *during* the Alta Edad Media, not after it.
*   **D: Siglo XI:** The Templars existed *during* the 11th century, not after it.

El texto menciona que los cirujanos romanos conocían varios sedantes para usar después de las lesiones. Esto implica que los utilizaban para aliviar el estrés postraumático que sufrían los soldados heridos.

Las otras opciones son procedimientos o elementos específicos utilizados en el tratamiento, pero no representan un beneficio directo para el *bienestar emocional* de los soldados.

Here's why:

The passage *directly states* ""oikotevẽ tesáre térã temiandu órgano sistema visual-pegua rehe"" - ""you need to study or understand the organ system of vision.""  This is the core requirement mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojesarekóvo ambue tapicha organismo rehe** (Observing another person's organism) - This is mentioned as an example of *how* you might learn, not *what* you need to do to have vision.
* **C: Jeñandu ambue onda pukukue** (Reading other wave patterns) - This relates to how vision works, but isn't the fundamental thing you *need* to do to have vision.
* **D: Oguereko jehecha porã iñambuéva** (Having good vision) - This is a *result* of a functioning visual system, not something you *need* to do.



"
Mba’épa odepende pe variación tesa estructura rehegua umi organismo apytépe?,"The correct answer is **A: Sensibilidad onda pukukue rehegua** (Sensitivity to light waves).

Here's why:

The passage states that organisms with different adaptations (like better vision) have different structures. This is *because* they need to be sensitive to different kinds of light or different levels of light.  The passage highlights how a better visual system allows an organism to ""perceive different wavelengths and have better vision,"" which directly relates to sensitivity to light waves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojesarekóvo ambue tapicha organismo rehe** (Relationship to other organisms) -  While organisms interact, the *structure* of their visual system doesn't depend on other organisms. It depends on their needs for survival.
* **C: Oguereko jehecha porã iñambuéva** (Having good vision) - Good vision is a *result* of structural variation, not the cause of it.
* **D: Hasykue iñambueva organismo kuerape** (Size of the organism) -  Size might play a role, but isn't the primary driver of variation in visual system structure.  A small organism can have a complex visual system, and a large organism a simple one, depending on its environment and needs.

This translates to ""For the Sikhs, their religion is not simply a branch of Hinduism, even though it also originates from it.""  This directly addresses the relationship between Sikhism and Hinduism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the text mentions Sikhism originating with Indian tradition, it doesn’t identify this as the name of the religion itself.
*   **B:** The text explains that ""Guru"" has a general meaning in Indian religions, but it specifically highlights its importance *within* Sikhism.
*   **C:** This is a fact about the history of Sikhism, but it doesn't define what Sikhism *is*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hindu tradición-kuéra:** While the text mentions the Sijismo isn't simply a branch of Hinduism, it doesn't say Hindu traditions *define* it.

*   **D: Ojeñe'ẽ Punjab ñe'ẽ:**  ""Gurmat"" is the Punjabi term for the Sikh teachings, but it's the *Guru* that represents the defining element of the religion itself.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ikatu mitã orekova Transtorno Déficit de atención rehegua ndaikatúi oñatende?","The correct answer is **A: Mbo'ehaopegua tembiapo** (schoolwork).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mitãnguéra orekóva TDA ndaikatúi oñatende ambue mba'e ikatúva mbo'ehaopegua tembiapo, katu ikatu oñetende ambue ojaposéva rehe, ñembosarái ñeha'ã térã ohecha ta'ãngamýi térã ohaikuaa oración omokytã'ỹre.""

This translates to: ""Children with ADHD may not be able to focus on schoolwork, but they can focus on other things, like playing games, watching TV, or understanding a story.""

Therefore, the text specifically mentions that children with ADHD *cannot* focus on schoolwork. The other options (playing games, watching TV, understanding stories) are things they *can* focus on.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére mitã orekova Transtorno Déficit de atención rehegua ojapo tembiapo orekóva riesgo?","The correct answer is **D: Omokyre'ỹ hag̃ua iñapytu'ũ** (To get attention).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko'ã mitã iñapaluãi heta jepi, ojapo rupi tembiapo orekóva riesgo, """"oike ñorãirõme, ha ombohovái mburuvichakuérape"""" omokyre'ỹ haguã iñapytu'ũ...""  This translates to: ""These children often do risky things, """"to get into trouble and be sent to the principal"""" to get attention...""

Therefore, the text directly links risky behavior in children with TDA to a desire for attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isa'ive hag̃ua hiperactiviad** (To release hyperactivity) - While hyperactivity is a symptom, the text doesn't specifically say risky behavior is *for* releasing it.
*   **B: Ojoaju hag̃ua iñirũnguéra ndive** (To interact with peers) - The text doesn't mention this as a reason.
*   **C: Itúva ha isy opena hag̃ua hese** (To make their parents feel bad) - The text doesn't focus on the intention to upset parents.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva ko’ãvaguipa ndaha'éi peteĩ techapyrã andamio rehegua?","The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ programa de estudio independiente** (An independent study program).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""andamio"" as a tool to help people with learning, specifically a way to practice and get feedback.** It mentions it can be a computer program or a structured exercise. This aligns perfectly with the concept of an independent study program - something you work through on your own, potentially with technological assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jehechauka ñembosarái mboyve computadora-pe (A demonstration mainly on a computer)** - While *andamio* can *use* a computer, the passage doesn't define it *as* a computer demonstration. It's broader than that.
* **B: SAT mbo'ehára (SAT tutor)** - The passage doesn't specify that *andamio* is related to the SAT or any specific test. It's a general learning aid.
* **D: Peteĩ entrenador liga menor-pegua (A minor league coach)** - This is a completely unrelated concept. *Andamio* is about self-directed practice, not someone coaching you directly.



"
Máva ko'ã apytépe ndomombe'úi concepto andamio rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha'e peteĩ método oipytyvõva umi tapicha, ndaha'éi peteĩ método kuaapyrã**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Andamio ndaha'éi peteĩ kuaapyrã método, katu h´´ina peteĩ método oipytyvõva umi tapicha oguerekóva peteĩ tembiasa pyahu kuaapyrãme...""  This translates to ""Andamio is not a scaffolding method, but it is a method that helps people...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Andamio ikatu ha’e virtual:** While the passage *mentions* virtual andamios, it doesn't define that as the core concept.
* **C: Oje'e avei chupe Kuaapy oñemopyendáva apopyrã:** This refers to a specific use case, not the definition of andamio itself.
* **D: Oipytyvõ umi tapicha oguerekóva peteĩ tembiasa pyahu kuaapyrãme:** This describes *what* andamio does, but not *what it is* – it doesn't define it.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oreko MySpace ikatuva opytyvõ temimbo'ekuérape?","The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ direccion internet pegua** (A web address).

Here's why:

The text states: ""emoĩ nte vaerã pe direccion internet pegua, ha pea ndahasýi nemandu'a haguã"" which translates to ""go to their web address, and you don't need to memorize it.""  This directly indicates that having a web address is how MySpace can help users.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikatu oñemoĩ porãve** (It can be organized well) - While the text mentions organization, it doesn't say it *helps* users.
* **B: Blogs** - Blogs are mentioned as a *feature* of MySpace, but not as a way MySpace itself helps users.
* **D: 54 millon perfil** (54 million profiles) - This is a statistic *about* MySpace, not something it provides to help users.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ndojapói Krushchev oĩrõ guare guerosapukái?","The correct answer is **A: Omohenda primer ministro**.

Here's why:

The text states that Krushchev ""omohenda hag̃ua Wladyslaw Gomulka ojehayhúvape primer ministro ramo"" - meaning he *arranged for* Wladyslaw Gomulka to be appointed as Prime Minister. This is the action Krushchev took *instead* of continuing with the original plan of imposing reforms from above.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oguerahauka tanque ojoko hag̃ua sarambi** (He sent tanks to quell unrest) - While he *threatened* this, it doesn't explain what he did *instead* of imposing reforms.
* **C: Ohupi tembiapo repy** (He stopped the reforms) - The text doesn't say he stopped the reforms entirely, but shifted *how* they were implemented.
* **D: Omonĩ upépe ojejeruréva** (He showed what was being protested) - This is a description of a consequence, not what Krushchev *did* differently.



"
Mávapa ndaha'éi peteĩ causa oiko haguére guerosapukái Polonia-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Comunismo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the protests in Poland were a reaction *against* communism (""trotesta general comunismo rovake""). While the other options (poor living conditions, working conditions, and Gomulka becoming prime minister) were *related* to the situation, they were the *results* of the communist system or attempts to address issues *within* it, not the fundamental cause of the unrest.  The core issue driving the protests was opposition to communist rule.



"
"Ko maranduhái he’iháicha, ko'ã apytépe mba'e ndojapói mba'eve Unión Sovíetica ha Estados Unidos mbojoaju rehe?","La respuesta correcta es **D: Sistema ñembohovake**.

El texto dice explícitamente que después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, los sistemas (de gobierno, procesos y cultura) que surgieron afectaron negativamente a los países.  La unión de la Unión Soviética y Estados Unidos buscaba establecer estos sistemas en otros lugares, lo que finalmente llevó a la Guerra Fría.

Las otras opciones son incorrectas porque:

*   **A: Cultura joavy** - La cultura es mencionada como algo que se ve afectado, pero no como el punto principal de la colaboración entre la Unión Soviética y Estados Unidos.
*   **B: Oje'eva Alemania rehe** - Alemania es el punto de partida del texto, pero no el objetivo de la colaboración.
*   **C: Proceso iñambue ojoehegui** - El proceso es mencionado junto con los sistemas, pero no es el foco principal de la cooperación inicial."
Ko'ã apytéguipa mba'e ndohechaukahai mba'erã ojeguerahauka impulso nervioso ava rete rupive?,"The correct answer is **B: Osyryry katui hag̃ua tuguy** (To quickly transmit signals).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states the nervous system *osyryry katui hag̃ua tuguy* (quickly transmits signals) as its function in maintaining homeostasis and responding to threats.  The passage explains that nerve impulses are sent *to achieve quick transmission*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbegueve osyryry hag̃ua tuguy** (To slowly transmit signals) - The passage explicitly emphasizes *quick* transmission.
* **C: Ojoko homeostasis-pe** (It's in homeostasis) - This describes *where* the system functions, not *how* it functions.
* **D: Oipytyvõva rete jeikove oimeraẽ amenaza oguerekóvagui** (Helping the body react to a threat) - This is a *result* of the nerve impulses, not the reason they are sent.



"
Mba'e ikatu ejuhu Meseta de Giza-pe?,"The correct answer is **D: Gran Piramide**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Meseta de Giza...oreko heta pirámide (gran pirámide hína pe ijapytepekuéra tuichavéva), heta templo ha gran Esfinge.""  This means the Great Pyramid is *located* on the Giza Plateau.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tumba:** While tombs *are* on the Giza Plateau, the question asks what you can *find* there, and the Great Pyramid is a specific landmark.
* **B: Templo:** Temples are mentioned, but the Great Pyramid is the most prominent feature.
* **C: Opavave siete maravillas:** The text states the Great Pyramid *was* one of the seven wonders, not that all of them are found there.



"
Mba'erã ojejapo raka'e pe Gran Piramide?,"The correct answer is **B: Oñemopu’ã oñemomorã hag̃ua faraón** (It was built to commemorate the pharaoh).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Gran pirámide oñemopu’ã oñemomorã hag̃ua faraón Khufu"" (The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiko hag̃ua chugui peteĩ siete maravillas apytépe** (To be one of the seven wonders) - While true, this is a *result* of its construction, not the *reason* for it.
* **C: Oiko hag̃ua tenda ojekuaava ramo** (To be a place for tourists) - The passage doesn't mention tourism.
* **D: Oñeñongatu hag̃ua tumba umi omanóva'ekue mba'e** (To serve as a tomb for those who died) - While it *contains* tombs, its primary purpose was commemoration of the pharaoh, with other structures built for his family and retinue.



"
Máva ha'e responsable ko árape ñande jaikuaa hag̃ua tarendype oñehundi hague templo?,"The correct answer is **C: Estrabón**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tembiasa haiha Grecia-gua Estrabón ohai tenondeve, ha’eha ko árape ojeikuaaháicha."" This translates to: ""The Greek Strabo wrote about it, and this is how we know about it today."" 

Therefore, Estrabón is the one responsible for us knowing about the burning of the temple today through his writings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Efesio-kuéra:** They are mentioned as being upset about the name Herostratus, but not as the source of the information about the burning.
* **B: Alejandro Magno:** He offered to rebuild the temple, but didn't provide information about its destruction.
* **D: Artemisa:** She is the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not a source of information about its burning.



"
Máva ko'ãva apytépe ha'e peteĩ mba’e añete oñemopu'ã jey haguére Artemisa templo?,"The correct answer is **B: Oñemopu'ã Alejandro Magno omano rire** (It was rebuilt after Alejandro Magno died).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Uperire, Alejandro omano rire, pe templo oñemopu’ã jey 323 a.C. arýpe."" (After that, after Alejandro died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 a.C.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alejandro Magno ñemopu'ã repy ojehepyme'ẽ** (Alejandro Magno's reconstruction was offered) - The text says he *was offered* to rebuild it, but it wasn't actually done *during* his lifetime.
* **C: Herostrato mbaretépe ohepyme'ẽ ñemopu'ã repy** (Herostrato's evil deed offered the reconstruction) - Herostrato *destroyed* the temple, he didn't offer to rebuild it.
* **D: Oñemopu’ã jey 320 a.C. arýpe** (It was rebuilt in 320 a.C.) - The text specifically states it was rebuilt in **323 a.C.**, not 320 a.C.

"Ko maranduai he’iháicha, araka'e guive ikatu ra'e peteĩ especie oguata hetyma ári?","The correct answer is **A: 7 millon arýma**.

The text states ""Sahelanthropus ikatúma ra'e oguara hetyma ári ojapóma 7 millóna arýma,"" which translates to ""Sahelanthropus could be the oldest species dating back to 7 million years ago.""

Therefore, according to the text, a species could have existed as early as 7 million years ago."
Máva ko'ãva especie pa'ũme oguatama raka'e hetyma ári?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Sahelanthropus ikatúma ra'e oguara hetyma ári ojapóma 7 millóna arýma."" which translates to ""...Sahelanthropus could be the oldest species, appearing around 7 million years ago.""

The question asks which species appears earliest in the lineage. Sahelanthropus is presented as potentially the oldest, predating Australopithecus, Homo Erectus, and even the ""pýpe jeguata"" (early ancestors) represented by Australopithecus fossils.



"
Mba'épa oheka raka'e marina Alemania-gua Tetãnguéra Ñorãirõ guasu mokõihápe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojoko hag̃ua mba'e repy oúva Gran Bretaña-gui** (To intercept what comes out of Great Britain).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alemania-gua marina, oiporúvo submarino-kuéra, oñeha'ã kuri ojoko upe tráfico."" This translates to ""The German navy, using submarines, tried to intercept that traffic.""  The ""tráfico"" refers to the supplies and materials being sent from the United States to Great Britain.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojoko Gran Bretaña-gui hetãygua ha mba'erepykuéra** - This says they were intercepting things *from* Great Britain, which is the opposite of what the text says.
* **C: Omongu'e material oceano Atlántico rupive** - This states they were *sending* materials, not intercepting them.
* **D: Ojoko tapichakuéra ha material ñemongu'e Estados Unidos-gui** - They were trying to intercept materials destined *for* Great Britain, not directly from the US.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa orekove éxito batalla naval-pe campaña Atlantico Norte jave?","The correct answer is **A: Gran Bretaña ha Estados Unidos**.

Here's why:

The text states that the United States aided Great Britain by transporting people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.  It also mentions Germany attempted to disrupt this aid with submarines. The text implies success for the Allies (Gran Bretaña and Estados Unidos) in countering Germany's efforts was crucial to preventing Germany from dominating Europe. Therefore, their combined effort was key to success in the North Atlantic campaign.



"
Mba'e ndaipóri gueteri kuri asirio ogueroikémaro guare caballería?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalcha jeguapyră**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hakatu ndoguerekói gueteri **ikalcha jeguapyrã**, upévare caballería asiria oñorairõ kavaju nandi ári gueteri.""  This translates to: ""They didn't have **stirrups**, therefore the Assyrian cavalry fought on horses without stirrups.""

The passage explains that the Assyrians used cavalry, but lacked stirrups, making their cavalry different.  The other options are things they *did* have:

*   **Hu’ykuéra:**  They had infantry.
*   **Mba’yrumỹi:** They had armies.
*   **Armadura:** They had armor.



"
Mba'éicha oiko ñorairö orekóva caballería?,"The correct answer is **C: Cabaju ári**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Caballería ha’e peteĩ ejército oñorairõva **kavaju ári**."" (Cavalry is an army that fights **on horseback**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Py ári** - The text doesn't mention fighting with fire.
*   **B: Armadura'ỹme** - While armor was used, it doesn't define *how* the cavalry fought.
*   **D: Sa'ive oñorairõva ndive** -  The text doesn't focus on *who* they fought with, but *how* they fought.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõ kuri nderetopamõ'ái Babilonio-kuéra ndaha'éiva pa'i rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Ojapo sacrificio tupão korapy nandipe** (They made sacrifices with abundant food).

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Avakuéra ojapo sacrificio tupãkuérapeg̃uarã ha pa’ikuéra oñeha’ã oñangareko tupãkuéra remikotevẽ ñembo’e ha jeroky rupive.""  This translates to ""The men made sacrifices to the gods and the children tried to keep the gods happy with offerings and songs.""  It further mentions ""korapy nandi"" which means ""abundant food"" was used in the sacrifices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oho ñembo'epe peteĩ tupão teĩpe** (They went to pray in a temple) - While they *went* to the temple (""tupã roga""), the passage focuses on the sacrifices, not just the act of prayer.
* **C: Jerokyhape korapy nandipe** (They sang songs with abundant food) - While songs *were* part of the offerings, the primary focus is on the sacrifices of food.
* **D: Oraha sacrificio tupã renda tupão ryepýpe** (They offered sacrifices to the god inside the temple) - The passage doesn't specifically say *where* inside the temple the sacrifices were offered, only *that* they were offered.



"
Máva ko'ã apytépe ha'e pa'i añónte g̃uarã?,"The correct answer is **B: Tupã renda tupão ryepýpe** (The top of the temple).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...upéi peteĩ tupã renda hyepýpe ikatuhápe oike pa’ikuéra añónte."" This translates to ""...then on top of the temple, people could enter.""  This directly identifies the top of the temple as the place people entered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeroky** (Priests) - While priests performed rituals, they weren't *the place* people entered.
*   **C: Ñembo'e** (Offerings) - Offerings were *made to* the gods, not a place people entered.
*   **D: Zigurats** (Pyramids) - Zigurats are the overall structure, not the specific location of entry.



"
Araka'e rire oñemomba’eguasueterei Rey Tutankamón-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojejuhu rire he'õngue renda** (After the tomb was found).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hakatu, he’õngue renda jejuhu 1922-pe, omomba’eguasueteri ichupe."" This translates to ""However, when the tomb was found in 1922, he became very famous.""  Therefore, his fame increased *after* the tomb was discovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñemonda rire he'õngue renda** (When the tomb was built) - The text doesn't say he became famous *when the tomb was built*, but *when it was found*.
* **B: Ha'e Rey jave** (Because he was a king) - While being a king contributed to his historical importance, the text specifically links his *fame* to the discovery of the tomb.
* **D: Héra oĩ rupi rey-kuéra réra rysýi ymave guarépe** (Because his name was among the names of famous kings) - The text states his name wasn’t well known *before* the tomb was found.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Heta te’õngue renda ymaguaréva oñemonda, kóva katu ojejuhu aimete oĩhaguéichaite."" (Many things were found in his tomb, and it was found almost intact.) This directly answers the question of what makes Tutankhamon a famous Egyptian king – the incredible discoveries *within his tomb*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojejuhu rire he'õngue renda oĩhagueichaite** (It was found almost intact) - While true, this *describes* the condition of the tomb, it doesn't explain *why* he's a famous king.
* **B: Oĩ rupi opa Rey rysýi-pe** (He is in all the lists of kings) - The passage specifically states he was *not* initially well-known or considered important among the other kings.
* **D: Oñemomba'eguasu rupi chupi Egipcio época-pe** (He was famous during the Egyptian period) - The passage says the opposite; he wasn't well-known *until* his tomb was discovered.



"
Mba'e raka'e ñe'ẽpapahára griego Homero ndikatúi ojapo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ñe'ẽ** (Language/Words).

The text states Homero was a *ñe’ẽpapahára griego* - a Greek poet, which directly translates to a ""word-maker"" or someone who works with language. He is known for his poems, the *Ñe’ẽpoty Ilíada* and *Odisea* (poems Iliad and Odyssey).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ñehendu (Hearing):** While poetry is meant to be heard, Homero's *creation* wasn't hearing itself.
*   **B: Jehecha (Seeing):**  Homero wrote, he didn't primarily *see* something to create his work.
*   **C: Jeguata (Path/Way):** This doesn't relate to his profession as a poet.



"
Máva ha'e griego ndojeikuaáiva chupe jehaipyporãmby rupivénte?,"The correct answer is **C: Pitágoras**.

Here's why:

The text states Pitágoras was a mathematician known for his theorem about right triangles. This is a field of knowledge *different* from the literary achievements (poetry/plays) of Homero, Sófocles, and Aristófanes. The question asks who is *not* known for their literary contributions.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sófocles:** The text explicitly states he was a popular playwright.
*   **B: Homero:** The text explicitly states he was a poet and author of the *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.
*   **D: Aristófanes:** The text explicitly states he was a popular playwright.



"
Moo raka'e oiko katuete umi familia hebreo-kuérava?,"The correct answer is **A: Okaháre**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umi familia hebreo-kuéra hetave jey oiko hikuái **okaháre** hekove’aja."" This translates to ""Many Hebrew families still live near the **desert**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tape gotyo (on the road):** The passage mentions they *pass by* the road, not that they live there.
*   **C: Korapýpe (in the courtyard):** The women work in the courtyard, but the families don't *live* there.
*   **D: Ógape (in the house):** The passage says the house is pleasant but doesn't specifically state they live *in* the house, only near the desert.



"
Mba'e ndohecharamõi umi familia hebreo-kuérava?,"The correct answer is **C: Ogakuéra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Medio Oriente ára pytu hakukuépe, **ogakuéra ndojehecharamõi**."" This directly translates to ""In the Middle East during the dry season, **they (ogakuéra) weren't seen much**."" The question asks what isn't seen much with the Hebrew families, and the passage explicitly states it's ""ogakuéra"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ára pytu (Dry Season):** While the context is *during* the dry season, the dry season itself isn't what isn't seen.
*   **B: Koty (Things/Objects):** The passage doesn't say things aren't seen, it refers to people.
*   **D: Tembi'u apo (Work/Effort):**  The passage mentions women working, so work is happening, it isn't something unseen.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui noñemombe’úi ojoavyha umi tetã escandinavo apytépe?,"The correct answer is **C: Hekokatu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...heta mba’épe ndojojoguái avakuéra, rey, **hekokatu** ha Dinamarca, Suecia, Noruega ha Islandia rembiasa."" This directly links *hekokatu* (politics/government) to the Scandinavian countries mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rembiasa** - While *rembiasa* (relationships) are mentioned, it's in the context of the countries *having* relationships, not what they don't share.
*   **B: Yvy** (land) - The passage discusses land (Groenlandia), but doesn't say the Scandinavian countries don't share it.
*   **D: Avakuéra** (people) -  The passage implies interaction between the Scandinavian people and the Inuit, so they *do* have connection with people.



"
Máva oguahẽ tendonde raka'e Groenlandia-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Tribu esquimal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jepéramo tetãnguéra “escandinavo” meme, heta mba’épe ndojojoguái avakuéra, rey, hekokatu ha Dinamarca, Suecia, Noruega ha Islandia rembiasa. **Umi tribu esquimal oikomava’ekuevoi upépe upéramo guare.**"" 

This translates to: ""Despite the 'Scandinavian' countries, they didn't really bother the people, kings, or colonies of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. **The Eskimo tribes already lived there.**""

Therefore, the Eskimo tribes were the first to inhabit Greenland.



"
Mávapa okarupyharéne apyka'ỹme?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuimba'e Roma-pegua iviru hetáva** (Roman men with strong appetites).

Here's why:

The text states: ""kuimba’ekuéra iviru hetáva oguerohory umi karu guasu ha okarujoa hikuái ojekohápe.""  This translates to ""men with strong appetites enjoyed large feasts and ate a lot during banquets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuña Roma-pegua iviru hetáva** (Roman women with strong appetites) - The text focuses on the men's feasting.
* **B: Kuimba'e Roma-pegua iviru sa'íva** (Roman men with weak appetites) - The text explicitly states they had *strong* appetites.
* **D: Kuña Roma-pegua iviru sa'íva** (Roman women with weak appetites) - The text doesn't mention women's appetites at all in this context.



"
Mba'épa ndaipoichéne ymaguare Roma-pegua tembi'ukuérape?,"The correct answer is **D: Pavo ojyva** (Turkey).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""ni peteĩ romano ymaguare ndo’úiva araka’eve peteĩ pavo.""  This translates to ""not even an ancient Roman ate a turkey."" This directly answers the question of what ancient Roman cuisine *didn't* include.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Invitado-kuéra iviru sa'íva okaruva oguapyhápe** (Guests eating very rich food at a party) - The text mentions rich feasts, but doesn't say Romans *didn't* have them.
*   **B: Caracol** (Snail) - The text mentions snails (caracol) as something they *did* eat (lirón is a type of snail).
*   **C: Kuimba'e iviru hetáva okaruva ojekohápe** (Rich men eating at a celebration) - Similar to option A, it describes a Roman practice, not something they lacked.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndorekoichene impacto guasu?","The correct answer is **C: Tavusu-estado**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Umi tavusu-estado ha’e omoheñóiva tetãnguéra"" (The states/countries are those that create nations).  It also links *civilis* and *civitas* to the idea of the state/city-state/nation.  The passage emphasizes how states are fundamental to civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Peteĩ tekoha (A territory/environment):** While a territory is important for civilization, the text doesn't say it's the *most* impactful element.
* **B: Peteĩ cultura imichĩva (A complex culture):**  Culture is a *part* of civilization, but the text focuses on the organizational structure (states) as the defining aspect.
* **D: Arandupy civilización-pegua (A civilization-related concept):** This is too broad. The passage is asking for what specifically has a large impact *within* civilization.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e omoheñói peteĩ tetãme?","The correct answer is **C: Tavusu-estado**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Umi tavusu-estado ha’e omoheñóiva tetãnguéra."" which translates to ""The states/city-states are those that form nations.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arandupy civilización-pegua** - While civilization is discussed, it's not *what* forms a nation, but rather a broader concept.
* **B: Peteĩ arandupy hekoteéva** - This is a general description of civilization, not the specific element that creates a nation.
* **D: Cultura-kuéra imichĩva** - This option isn't mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel omoñepyrũ peteĩ fortaleza omomorã hag̃ua osẽre tenonde ñorãirõhára tibetano-mongoles rovake."" which translates to ""Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel began building a fortress to defend against invading Tibetan-Mongol armies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ Bután-pe** (It is in Bhutan) - While true, this doesn't explain *what* Drukgyal Dzong *is* or its purpose. It's a statement of location, not a defining characteristic.
* **C: Tata guasu rupive opyta sa’imíntema Drukgyal Dzong reliquia** (Important relics of Drukgyal Dzong were kept there) -  This is a detail *about* the Dzong, but not its primary function.
* **D: Omoñepyrũ Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** (It was founded by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) -  True, but the question asks *what* it was built *for*, not *who* built it.

* **B: Camboya oike Tailandia yvýpe 1772-pe** - The passage states the *opposite*: Tailandia-gua oike Camboya yvýpe (Thailand invaded Cambodia).
* **D: Tailandia-gua ohundiete Phnom Phen** - While true, this is only *part* of what the passage says, and option C is a broader, more encompassing statement about the overall context.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""pH nivel ojehechakuaa mboy ion de hidrógeno-pa oguereko rupi upe (H pH ryepýpe) upe sustancia química oñemoneĩvape."" This translates to ""The pH level is determined by how many hydrogen ions (H in the pH scale) the substance contains.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mba’éichaitépa oguereko ácido térã básico upe químico** (How acidic or basic the chemical is) - While pH *indicates* acidity/basicity, it *measures* the concentration of hydrogen ions.  This is a result, not the measurement itself.
* **B: Mba’éichaitépa oguereko protón-kuéra upe químico-pe** (How many protons the chemical has) - Protons *are* hydrogen ions, but the text specifically focuses on the *ion* concentration, not just the total number of protons.
* **D: Mba’éichaitépa oguereko electrón-kuéra upe químico** (How many electrons the chemical has) -  Electrons are important to understand what hydrogen ions *are* (hydrogen atoms minus an electron), but the pH level is determined by the *number of hydrogen ions*, not electrons.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hidrógeno ion-kuéra ha’e hína umi protón-kuéra ojepe’ava’ekue chuguikuéra electrón oguerekóva..."" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ion concentration, not what they *are*.
* **C: Alcalino:** Alcalino (alkaline/basic) describes a type of substance, not the ions themselves.
* **D: Electrón-kuéra:**  Electrons are *lost* by hydrogen atoms to *become* hydrogen ions (protons), but aren't the ions themselves.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umi león aty oiko ku jagua ha aguara atýicha..."" which translates to ""The lion group lives with hyenas and jackals..."". This is a detail about the lions' lifestyle that isn't a typical characteristic *of* lions themselves – it’s about their environment and who they co-exist with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Macho ha hembra ndojojái mboy-pe** (Males and females don't hunt together) - The passage *implies* males and females hunt together because it mentions males protecting the group.
* **C: Macho ha hembra oikopa ojoapytépe** (Males and females live together in the pride) - This *is* a characteristic of lions, and is stated directly in the passage.  The question asks for something that's *not* a typical lion characteristic.
* **D: Ha'ekuéra oikokuaa ojoapytépe ha avei pya'e ojukakuaa** (They are known to live in prides and are also known to be brave) - Being known to live in prides *is* a characteristic of lions.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""mymba'kuéra ojojoguaitereíva león-pe (katu ndojoguái ĩ ambue mbarakajakuérape) hekokuéra rupive...""  This translates to ""their young are only played with by lions (but not with other animals) with their claws..."" This clearly indicates a difference in how lions interact with their own versus other animals – meaning their behavior *isn't* the same towards all animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oikokuaa ojoapytépe** (They live in the jungle) - This is a general statement about their habitat and doesn't indicate anything *unusual* about their behavior.
* **B: Oiko ku aguara atýicha** (They live with hyenas) -  This is simply a statement about co-existence, not unique behavior.
* **C: Macho ha hembra pya’e ojukakuaa hapichápe** (Males and females are easily recognized) - This is a descriptive detail, not a behavioral difference.

Tapiti mávape g̃uarã presa jepigua?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbarakaja ndatuicha guasúiva**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umíva guýpe oĩ mbarakaja **ndatuicha guasúiva** ho’úva tapiti guive..."" (Among them, there are **large, fierce** jaguars that eat tapirs...)  The question asks what the tapir is prey *to*.  Therefore, the large, fierce jaguar is the predator.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mbarakaja imichĩva** (small jaguars) - The text mentions small jaguars eating smaller things like insects, but doesn't say they eat tapirs.
*   **B: Mbarakaja ituicháva** (simple/plain jaguars) - This isn't specified as eating tapirs.
*   **D: Antílope-kuéra** (Antelopes) - Antelopes are *also* eaten by the jaguars, but the question is specifically about what the tapir is prey *to*.



"
Mba'épa ho'u umi mbarakaja michĩvéva?,"The correct answer is **A: Anguja**.

This translates to ""there are many small armadillos (some of them domestic armadillos that are raised) that eat small things, such as insects, **ants**, beetles and worms.""

Therefore, ants (anguja) are specifically mentioned as food for the small armadillos.

Mávapa ko’ãvagui ndaha'éi peteĩ mba’e ojapóva jaguarete'i ojapyvy jave?,"The correct answer is **D: Ho'u mymba michĩvéva chuguínte.**

* **The passage states:** ""Umi jaguaretei ho’use mymba michĩvéva."" (Jaguars eat dense meat.) and ""Aimete opavave mymba jaguaretei ojapyvýva michĩeteve ichugui."" (All jaguars that live well eat a lot.)  This establishes that *eating dense meat* is a key characteristic of jaguars. The question asks what isn't something a jaguar does when it's well-nourished, and not eating dense meat contradicts the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Okañy hekoháre** (It roams in the forest) - The passage *mentions* this (""Jaguaretei okañy ojakuévo hekoháre""), but it's not something they *don't* do when well-fed.
* **B: Omuña mymba ho’uva’erã ohetũhame** (It hunts prey to be full) - The passage states ocelotes do this, not necessarily jaguaretei when they already have enough to eat.
* **C: Omuña mymba pyharekue** (It hunts colored prey) - The passage only mentions seeing prey well with night vision, not specifically hunting colored prey.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Aimete opavave mymba jaguaretei ojapyvýva michĩeteve ichugui."" This translates to ""And all the jaguar-like animals that live in the forest don't reveal themselves easily.""  The question asks what *isn't* mentioned about jaguars.  The text explicitly says they *don't* reveal themselves easily, making option D the statement that's *not* a general characteristic described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojapyvykuaa pyharekue (They are seen well in the daytime):** The text mentions seeing them well with night vision, implying they *aren't* easily seen in the daytime.
* **B: Oiko mbegue katuete (They have strong legs):** The text *does* mention their strong legs (""oikokuaa mbegue katuete"").
* **C: Ndohetü poräi hikuái (They are not seen well up close):** The text implies they *can* be seen well, especially with night vision.



"
Mávapa ko'ãvagui ndaha'éi jaguarete ojapokuaavéva?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñekorõrõ** (Roar).

The text states: ""Jaguarete ñekorõrõ ndaha’éi león korõrõichagua, ha’éte ku ñe’ẽrysýi oguerekóva ñe’ẽ vai ha osapukáiva.""  This translates to: ""The jaguar's roar is not like a lion's roar, it is a vocalization with strong and striking words.""  This means the jaguar *does* roar, but its roar is distinct.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ojupi yvate** (Can jump high) - The text says it *can* jump high, but doesn't say it doesn't roar because of this.
*   **C: Opo puku** (Runs fast) -  Similar to jumping, it *can* run fast, but this isn't the reason it doesn't roar like a lion.
*   **D: Oitira** (Has strength) - Again, it *has* strength, but this isn’t why its roar is different.

The text specifically states: ""Jaguarete ñekorõrõ ndaha’éi león korõrõichagua, ha’éte ku ñe’ẽrysýi oguerekóva ñe’ẽ vai ha osapukáiva.""  This translates to: ""The jaguar's roar is not the same as a lion's roar, it's a distinct sound with different characteristics and tones.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oytape:** (They climb) - The text mentions jaguaretes *can* climb, but doesn't say this is how they differ from lions.
*   **C: Jepo pukupe:** (In their strength) - The text mentions they are strong, but doesn't compare their strength to lions.
*   **D: Oitira hatãvéva:** (Their appearance) - While the text mentions they belong to the same genus, it doesn't focus on differences in appearance as a key distinction.

Ha’eraẽvete tapicha ohecha va’ekue célula-kuéra omanóva.""  This translates to: ""Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small compartments in cork with a microscope. This was important. It was the first time people saw existing cells.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Omaña organismore microscopio-guive** (He observed organisms with a microscope) - While he used a microscope, the passage specifically says he saw *cells*, not entire organisms.
* **C: Ohecha cuadro-kuéra imichĩ’iva** (He saw small compartments) - He *did* see these, but the significance was that they were the first observation of cells. The question asks what he did *because* of it - he allowed others to see living cells.
* **D: Otopa peteĩ unidad funcional michĩvéva peteĩ organismo oikovéva-gui** (He discovered a small functional unit of a living organism) - This is a *definition* of a cell, not something Hooke specifically *did*.  He observed them, but didn't initially understand their function.



"
"""Mba'e he'ise """"célula""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Koty imichĩva**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Cell ou latí ñe’ẽgui he’iséva koty michĩva"" which translates to ""Cell in Latin means small room.""  The passage directly defines ""célula"" (cell) as meaning ""koty michĩva"" (small room).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cuadro-kuéra imichĩ’iva (Small squares):** While Robert Hooke *saw* small squares in cork, that's what *led* him to the name ""cell,"" it's not the definition of the word itself.
* **C: Estructura imichĩva (Small structure):**  A cell *is* a small structure, but the passage focuses on the *origin of the name* and its literal translation.
* **D: Apu'akuéra imichĩ’iva (Small piles):** This isn't mentioned in the passage and isn't a correct translation or definition.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ojapokuaa opa mymba?","The correct answer is **B: Omỹi (They eat)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oĩhaguéicha mymbakuéra ikatu omỹi."" This translates to ""However, animals can eat.""  The passage is *about* animals and their characteristics, and specifically mentions their ability to eat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oveve (They float)** - While some animals float, it's not a universal characteristic mentioned as applying to *all* animals.
*   **C: Oyta (They go down)** - This refers specifically to where they live (in the depths), not a trait all animals share.
*   **D: Ojo'o (They appear)** - Again, a characteristic of *some* animals (like appearing on land) but not a defining trait of *all* animals.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ndaha’éi opaite mymba orekóva?","The correct answer is **C: Cerebro**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mymbakuéra añónte oguereko cerebro ( hakatu ndaha’éi opaite mymba; medusa, ndoguerekói cerebro ).""  This translates to ""Most animals have a brain (but not all animals; jellyfish do not have a brain).""

Therefore, the text explicitly states that *not all animals have a brain*.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Célula (Cell)** - All animals are made of cells, so this isn't something they *don't* all have.
*   **B: Jedigeri kuaa (sense of smell)** - The text doesn't mention anything about the sense of smell.
*   **D: Jekaru kuaa (sense of sight)** - The text mentions animals living in dark water, suggesting sight might be limited, but doesn't say they all *lack* it.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yvyramáta kuéra ojuhu alimento kuarahýpe **fotosíntesis rupive**.""  This translates to ""Plants take food through **photosynthesis** with the help of **sunlight**.""

Therefore, sunlight is essential for plants to perform photosynthesis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuarahy'ã (Light):** While light *is* important, the text specifically links photosynthesis to the *source* of the light - the sun.
*   **B: Mymba (Animals):** Animals don't help plants with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Tembi'u (Food):** Plants *produce* food through photosynthesis; they don't need food to *do* photosynthesis.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yvyramata kuéra ome’ẽ **oxigeno** avakuéra ipytúva ha oipyte dióxido de carbono avakuéra ipytuhóva"" which translates to ""Plants give **oxygen** to people who breathe and receive carbon dioxide from people who exhale.""

Therefore, plants give oxygen to people. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tembi'u** (Food) - While plants *are* food, the text doesn't say people give plants food in return.
*   **C: Y** - This is just a letter and doesn't relate to the text.
*   **D: Dióxido de carbono** (Carbon Dioxide) - Plants *receive* carbon dioxide *from* people, they don't give it to them.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã techaukaha apytépe oñemoĩne evolución renondépe?","The correct answer is **B: Aty’i oñemomombyry atyguasu oĩhagui**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how a population gets separated (oñemomombyry) from a larger group (atyguasu).** This separation is the *initial* step in the process of speciation (the formation of new species).  The text describes how this separation, whether by geographical barriers or other means, leads to the potential for the isolated population to evolve differently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aty'i oho ambue tendápe ha ndoikokuaái hekoha pyahúpe (The population goes to a new place and doesn't recognize the old habitat):** While this *can* happen as a result of the process, it's not the initial driving force described in the text. It's a *consequence* of separation and evolution.
* **C: Aty pyahu oñepyrũvo oikokuaáma hekoha pyahúpe (The new population starts to recognize the habitat):** This is also a consequence, describing how the population adapts, not the beginning of the process.
* **D: Aty ñemomombyry ojoehegui (The separation population changes):** This is too vague. The text emphasizes the *cause* of the change (separation) and how that leads to *potential* changes, not just the fact of change itself.



The core concept of the passage, and the starting point for evolution in this scenario, is the splitting and isolation of a population – therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of how the passage links to evolution."
Mávapa ko'ãva mombe'u apytépe ndomombe'úi proceso de especiación? ,"The correct answer is **A: Oiko aty pyahu ndoikokuaáiramo hekoha pyahúpe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Aty tee naiñambuei’ete mba’evépe, oikotevẽ gueteri ymaguaréichagua jeikokuaarã."" (Even if the populations don't know each other, they must have some form of recognition to avoid mating.) and later ""mokõive aty ndojojoguamo’ãvéimi mba’evépe ha ndaikatuvéimi ojehero ojueheguáramo."" (Two populations don't mate and don't even recognize each other). This isolation is a *key component* of the speciation process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba’eguasueterei evolución-pe g̃uarã:**  This says speciation is very important for evolution, which is *true*, but it doesn't describe *what* happens during speciation itself.
* **C: He’iséva hína especie pyahu ñepyrũ:** This means ""it is the beginning of a new species,"" which is the *result* of speciation, not the process itself.
* **D: Ndaikatúi ojehapejoko:** This means ""it cannot be stopped,"" which is also true but doesn't explain *how* the process unfolds.



Therefore, option A directly addresses a core condition for the process of speciation described in the text – populations not interbreeding."

The text (P) states: ""Tuguy osẽ korasõgui peteĩ tuguy rapére hérava arteria..."" which translates to ""Blood leaves the heart through a blood vessel called an artery...""  This directly answers the question of what carries blood *from* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Capilares:** Capillaries are mentioned as *small* vessels, not the ones leaving the heart.
* **C: Órgano-kuéra:**  This means ""organs"" - while the heart *is* an organ, it's not what carries the blood.

The text explicitly states: ""Umi tuguy rape michĩvéva hérava capilares."" which translates to ""The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Arteria** - Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **C: Vena-kuéra** - Veins carry blood *to* the heart.
* **D: Órgano-kuéra** -  ""Órgano-kuéra"" means organs - the heart is an organ, but not a blood vessel.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kóva rupi ikatu ombokatupyryve ichupe okañy hag̃ua umi tenda michĩvévape umi depredador-kuéragui."" This translates to ""Thus, it can help him prepare to escape from the dangerous traps of the predators.""

The passage explains the small birds use their wings to prepare to escape predators.  The other options are mentioned in the text *as things the bird needs* (food and nesting materials) but aren't the *reason* for developing strong wings.



"
Mba'e ko'ã apytépe ndoje'éi mymbachu'i oveve haguére?,"The correct answer is **D: Hekopete**.

Here's why:

The passage states the mymbachu'i (small bird) needs help to escape enemies, *to find food and **shelter** (hekopete)*. The question asks what isn't mentioned as something the mymbachu'i needs help with. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ijykererã jetopa (cold weather):** The passage mentions needing help to find food *and* shelter, implying a need to cope with weather conditions.
* **B: Mboypa oiko (how long it lives):** While the passage mentions the bird is small and ""ephemeral,"" it doesn't say it needs help *living* a certain amount of time.
* **C: Tembi'u jeheka (enough food):** The passage explicitly states the bird needs help *finding food*.



Therefore, **hekopete (shelter)** is the only thing the passage doesn't directly state the mymbachu'i needs help *getting*."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Heta tapicha noñakãngetái hesekuéra dinosaurio-háicha oreko rehe plumaje..."" which translates to ""Many people don't imagine them as dinosaurs with plumage..."" This implies plumage (feathers) is a characteristic *not* typically associated with dinosaurs, despite evidence suggesting some had them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokõi ipýre oguata** (Two legs walk) - The passage specifically mentions a T-rex walks on two legs, making this a dinosaur characteristic.
*   **C: Ombo'a** (Is strong) - Strength is a general characteristic often associated with dinosaurs.
*   **D: Ipy oreko garra** (Has claws on its feet) - The passage directly states dinosaurs had claws.

* **C: Ovevekuaa (They are seen):** This is a general statement and doesn't describe a specific shared characteristic.
* **D: Ipy oreko garra (They have claws on their feet):** This is true for some dinosaurs, but not *all* birds have prominent claws on their feet.

Ko yvyramáta ha’ete peteĩ palmera michĩva oguerekóva **hogue akua ha haimbéva**.""  This translates to: ""There are researchers who suggest Triceratops ate cicadas, which grew on plants that existed in the Cretaceous period. This plant was like a palm tree that had **sweet and tasty fruit**.""

The question asks what part of the cicada plant Triceratops could eat. The text specifically mentions the sweet, tasty fruit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hakãngue** (Beak/bill) - This refers to the Triceratops' beak, not a part of the plant.
*   **C: Hapo** (Sap) - The text doesn’t mention sap.
*   **D: Yva** (Poison) - While the text later mentions some plants having poison, it doesn’t relate that to what the Triceratops ate initially.

The text specifically states: ""Oĩ avei tembikuaahára he’íva ko’ã yvyramáta oguerekoha veneno ha upéva rupi ndaipóri dinosaurio ho’uva’erã..."" (There are also researchers who say that these plants have poison and that's why dinosaurs didn't survive...).  It then goes on to say that modern descendants of dinosaurs (like sloths) *can* eat these poisonous plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Perezoso (Sloth):** While sloths are mentioned as being able to eat the plants, they aren't the *thing* the Triceratops would eat that causes problems.
*   **B: Yvyra rakã hatãva (Tall trees):** The text mentions tall trees, but not as a specific food source causing issues.
*   **C: Gua'ái (Birds):** Birds are not directly linked to the Triceratops' potential food problems in the text.

Here's why:

The text states: ""katu ohasa Bélgica poguýpe Revolución belga 1830 rire."" This translates to ""but passed to Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.""  This directly explains why Luxembourg initially became part of Belgium.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ñorãirõ Guasu Peteĩ (World War I):** While Luxembourg was affected by WWI, it didn't *cause* it to be part of Belgium.
*   **C: Ñorãirõ Guasu Mokõi (World War II):**  Similar to WWI, WWII didn't initially place Luxembourg under Belgian control.
*   **D: Unión Europea Moñepyrũ (Founding of the European Union):** The EU came much later and was a joining *of* Luxembourg with other nations, not a reason for it to be initially connected to Belgium.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oike Alemania poguype** (It went with Germany) - While it *was* part of Germany during the World Wars, this wasn't the reason for its independence efforts.
*   **B: Oñembyaty Unión Europea rehe** (It joined the European Union) -  This is something Luxembourg did *after* becoming independent, not *to* become independent.

The text states: ""hakatu latín ojeporuve Ñandejara ñe’ẽ oñehendu hag̃ua"" which directly translates to ""but Latin is used to understand the Pope's words.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñe'ẽ ojeporuvéva** (Language used) - While Latin *is* a language used, the text specifies *why* it's used.
* **C: Ñe’ẽ léikuéra ñemboguapyrã** (Italian language for administration) - This describes the use of Italian, not Latin.
* **D: Tetã momarandurã** (State bureaucracy) -  This is related to Italian, not Latin.

The text states: ""Ciudad del Vaticano oipuru italiano ñe’ẽ léikuéra ñemboguapyrã ha Tetã momarandurã."" This directly translates to ""Ciudad del Vaticano uses Italian for daily communication and official state matters.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tetã momarandurã** (official state matters) - While Italian *is* used for this, the text specifies it's used for *both* daily communication *and* official matters.
*   **C: Ñandejara ñe’ẽ oñehendu hag̃ua** (to understand God's word) - The text says Latin is used for this, not Italian.
*   **D: Ñe'ẽ ojeporuvéva** (language used) - This is too general; the question asks *why* Italian is used.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""…kóichagua animación ojeporuva ára ha ára ta’ãngamỹi ha ta’ãngambyrýpe."" This translates to ""...this kind of animation is used day to day in music and advertising.""  It directly links the benefit of computers to *creating animations* for music and advertising.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Purahéi (Music):** While music *uses* the animations created by computers, the benefit isn't to the music itself, but to how it's presented.
* **C: Ta'ãnga (Advertising):** Similar to music, advertising *uses* the animations, it isn't the benefit *of* the computer's capabilities directly.
* **D: Mopu'ã (Education):** The passage doesn't mention anything about education.

Mba'e oiko patinador ojere hag̃ua akatúa gotyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Mokõive hembe’y cuchilla ykere**.

Here's why:

The passage states that two pushes (mokõive hembe’y) on the blade (cuchilla ykere) allow the skater to move forward.  It specifically describes how the blade, when pushed, transfers that force to propel the skater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cuchilla yvypegua ikarẽ rupi michĩmĩ (The strong blade is rigid):** While the blade's strength is mentioned, it doesn't *cause* the skater to move. It's the pushes that do.
* **C: Patinador talento rupi (The skater's talent):**  The passage focuses on the mechanics of the skates, not the skater's skill.
* **D: Yrypy'a calidad (The ice quality):** The ice is a factor, but the passage emphasizes how the skater uses the *skates* to move.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the reason for the skate having a hole (""ikuaha"") is due to **friction** (""ikarë""). The text explains how the hole allows air to escape, reducing friction and allowing the skater to move.  The other options are related, but not the *reason* for the hole:

* **Mokõi hembe'y (Two sides):**  While the skate has two sides, that's not the purpose of the hole.
* **Ojoapytépe (Support):** The hole isn't for support.
* **Ikarẽ'imi (Reducing friction):**  This is a *result* of the hole, not the reason *why* it exists.

This translates to: ""Scientists call this process 'emission of radiation' when atoms release light, and they release a light photon, and that light *is* a radiation.""  Crucially, the radiation is *caused* by the emission of photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radiación-gui (Through radiation):** While radiation *is* involved, it's the *result* of the process, not the mechanism by which atoms get rid of extra energy.
*   **C: Fotón-gui (Through photons):** This is close, but ""fotón ñeme'ẽ"" (emission of photons) is more specific to the process described in the text.
*   **D: Radiación ñeme'ẽ-gui (Through emission of radiation):** This is redundant because the text says the emission of photons *is* the radiation.



"
Mba'ére peteĩ átomo ome'ẽ peteĩ fotón?,"The correct answer is **A: Oñeguenohẽ energía extra** (It releases extra energy).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ojejapo oñeme’ẽnguévo michĩmi luz partícula hérava “fotón”.

This translates to: ""It is done by emitting light particles called 'photons'. Physicists call this process 'emission of radiation' when atoms release light due to transitions, and they release a light photon, and that light is a radiation.""

The key phrase is ""átomo oñemomỹi rupi luz mimbi rupive"" which indicates that atoms *release* a photon when they have extra energy.  The process is tied to releasing excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oñemomỹi rupi luz mimbi rupive** (Due to transitions of light) - This *describes* how photons are released, not *why* they are released.
* **C: Nivel de energía inestable** (Unstable energy level) - While instability *leads* to the release of energy, the passage doesn't directly state this as the reason.
* **D: Reacción adversa radiación-gui** (Adverse reaction to radiation) - The passage describes the *creation* of radiation (photons), not a reaction *to* it.

(After a while, the **filament inside the bulb burns out** and doesn't light up at Ko’agKo’ag̃a anymore...).  This directly explains *why* the bulb stops working – the filament breaks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndojeporu porãi rupi foco rehegua llave** (The switch for the bulb isn't working properly) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the switch.
* **B: Ndoikepái rupi foco base metálica casquillo-pe** (The bulb isn't fitted correctly onto the metal base of the socket) - While the passage *describes* how a short circuit can happen with the metal base, it doesn't say this is *why* the bulb doesn't work in general.
* **D: Electricidad oĩva casquillo-pe sa'i** (There's too much electricity in the socket) - This describes a potential *cause* of a problem (a short circuit), not the reason why a bulb generally fails.

The passage states: ""Hetaiterei aravo oiko rire, upe **foco filamento okái ha ndoikovéi** Ko’agKo’ag̃a katu...""  (When it's very hot, the **focus filament burns and doesn't work** anymore...).  This directly links the filament to the danger of the burned-out bulb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Llave foco rehegua (Switch for the bulb):** While a switch controls the power, the passage doesn't mention the switch *causing* the danger when changing the bulb.
* **C: Foco base (Bulb base/casquillo):** The base is mentioned as a potential point for a short circuit, but the *burning out* of the bulb is caused by the filament.
* **D: Cable (Cable):** The cable isn't directly mentioned as the source of the immediate danger in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Oñemboja’o pyahu jey pe núcleo opoi’imi upe energía"" which translates to ""The nucleus releases energy when it splits."" The question asks what happens when a nucleus is split (fissioned). Therefore, releasing energy is the direct result described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oĩve protón-kuéra (It has protons):** While true, the passage doesn't focus on the *presence* of protons, but what *happens* when the nucleus splits.
*   **C: Átomo-kuéra ndopytái (Atoms are unstable):**  The passage *mentions* unstable atoms can undergo fission, but it's not what *happens* during the splitting itself.
*   **D: Okañy neutrón-kuéra (It loses neutrons):**  The passage doesn't specifically state that neutrons are lost during fission, although it is a common occurrence. The primary point is the *release of energy*.

The question asks what helps us see better with technology. While satellites *collect* information, the **telescope** is the instrument specifically used for *seeing* and observing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Satélite-kuéra:** Satellites send information, they don't directly improve vision.
*   **C: Luz:** Light *is* what we see, but it's not a tool that helps us see *better*.
*   **D: Cohete-kuéra:** Rockets are used to *launch* things into space, they don't help with seeing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Luz** (Light) - Light is what telescopes *observe*, not how they are launched.
*   **C: Yvy atmósfera** (Earth's atmosphere) - The atmosphere is something telescopes have to overcome, it's not used to launch them.
*   **D: Satélite-kuéra 100 pie ivatéva** (Satellites 100 feet high) -  While satellites are related, the text specifically mentions rockets as the means of *putting* the telescope into space.



"
Mba'e ojeikuaava'erã evento cíclico-rehe ehapykueho hag̃ua tiempo ohasávo?,"The correct answer is **A: Duración**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Evento cíclico ha’e hína mba’e oiko jey jey katuíva."" (A cyclic event is something that happens repeatedly.) And then it links this to understanding the passage of time: ""Ndetevoi ikatu ehapykueho tiempo ohasávo, ehechakuévo upe oikóva jehecha jey jeývo."" (You can understand time passing by observing something happening repeatedly.)
* **Duración (Duration)** is the key element in understanding a cyclic event.  Knowing *how long* a cycle takes is crucial to perceiving the passage of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jehecha jey jeývo (Seeing it happen again and again):**  While this is *part* of a cyclic event, it's the *duration* of the repetitions that helps us measure time, not just the act of seeing it repeat.
* **C: Opamba'epe oĩ (It has a beginning):** All events have a beginning, but that doesn't define a *cyclic* event or help understand time's passage.
* **D: Hasy (Fast):** The speed of an event doesn't necessarily make it cyclic or help measure time.  A fast, non-repeating event doesn't give us a sense of time passing like a regular cycle does.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'éreheve oñembojoaju tiempo?","The correct answer is **C: Experiencia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tiempo avei ha’e mba’éichapa ñambojoajuse umi oikóva pukukue (ipukukue).""  This translates to ""Time is also how we perceive the past (our memories).""  Perception and how we understand the past are fundamentally tied to *experience*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pukukue:** While ""pukukue"" (past/memories) *relates* to time, it isn't *how* we perceive it. It's *what* we perceive *through* time.
* **B: Jehecha jey jeývo:** (Seeing it again and again) This refers to cyclical events, not the general concept of perceiving time.
* **D: Opamba'epe oĩ:** (It exists to change us) This is a statement about time's *effect* on us, not how we perceive it.



Therefore, **experiencia (experience)** best encapsulates how time is understood and perceived according to the text."

Here's why:

The text states ""ohupytyhápe 2:2 (jehechakuaa mokõihápegua)"" which directly translates to ""he obtained a 2:2 (honors degree)"".  The question asks what the heir to the throne *did*, and this is the specific academic achievement mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oheja mbo’ehaovu oho hag̃ua ejército-pe** (He finished his studies to go to the army) - The text mentions studying, but doesn't say it was *to* join the army.

The text states: ""upépe oñemoarandu Antropología ha Arqueología-pe..."" which translates to ""there he studied Anthropology and Archeology..."" This directly answers the question of what Charles studied.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oike ejército-pe omohu’ã mboyve mbo'ehao** (He went to the army to do his military service) - The text says he *will* go to the army, not that he *already* studied there.
*   **C: Ohupyty jehechakuaa** (He obtained a degree) - The text mentions he obtained a 2:2 degree, but this isn't *what* he studied.

Araka'e rupi Estonia oĩva’ekue Alemania arandupyeta poguýpe?,"The text states the situation occurred in the 15th century. The 15th century spans from 1401 to 1500, which is roughly 100 years. However, the question asks *how long* Estonia was under German influence. The text doesn't give an exact duration, but it implies a significant period. Looking at the options, none directly state 100 years. We need to interpret based on the context.

Considering the context of ""siglo XV"" (15th century) and the long-lasting impact described (monks, language influence, etc.), the influence wasn't just a short period.  Of the options, **B: Ojapo 400 ary rupi (Lasted about 400 years)** is the most reasonable, as German influence on Estonia extended well beyond the 15th century. While not precisely stated in the text, it’s the best fit given the broader historical context.



Therefore, the answer is **B**."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oñemopyenda alemán achegety rehe ha oñemoĩ tai “Õ / õ”."" This translates to ""It was adapted from the German alphabet and the character “Õ / õ” was added."" 

Therefore, the Estonian language was developed *because* of the German alphabet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tai “Õ / õ” rehe** -  The ""Õ"" character is *a part* of the adaptation, but not the reason *why* it was adapted.
* **C: Monje alemán-kuéra** - The monks brought the ideas, but the alphabet itself came from German.
* **D: Ñandejára** - ""God"" is mentioned in the context of the monks' work with the indigenous people, but doesn't explain the language development.

The passage states: ""Ñe’ẽharaitévavoi iñambuekuaa ojehecháramo umi dialecto ojoajuetereíva ojuehe."" This translates to ""The Hindi speakers are understood by observing the differing dialects.""  This directly explains *why* the number of native Hindi speakers is estimated - by looking at the various dialects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Urdu oñe'ẽva ojehecháramo:** While the passage mentions Urdu's relationship to Hindi, it doesn't say speakers are understood *because* of Urdu.

* **C: Joseon dinastía-gua irundyha rey omoheñóiva'ekue** - Also true, but doesn't make it a non-standard statement.  It simply states who created it.
* **D: Oñemoheñóiva jeporu katuirã opavépe g̃uarãva** - This is a general statement about the *purpose* of Hangeul, not its initial name.

The key is that the original name ""Hunmin Jeongeum"" is a specific detail that isn't always mentioned when discussing Hangeul, making it the answer that stands out as potentially not being a standard statement.



"
Hunmin Jeongeum achegety oñemoambue akue mba'épe?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ñepyrũraite oñehenói achegety Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum he’iséva “ Tyapu oĩporãva avakuéra ñemoarandurã”"" - This translates to ""Initially, the alphabet Hangeul was called Hunmin Jeongeum, which means 'The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People'.""
* **Hunmin Jeongeum** was the *original name* of what we now know as **Hangeul**. The question asks what the Hunmin Jeongeum alphabet was, and the answer is Hangeul.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sejong:**  Sejong was the *king* who commissioned the creation of the alphabet, not the alphabet itself.
* **C: Joseon:** Joseon is the *dynasty* during which it was created.
* **D: Jeongeum:** Jeongeum is part of the original name, but it doesn't represent the alphabet as a whole.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba’e ñe’ẽpa oguereko influencia sánscristo rehe?","The correct answer is **B: Ñe’ẽ-kuéra Europa-gua** (European languages).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sánscrito ha’e peteĩ ñe’ẽ ymaguare ha oñembojoja latín reh oñeñe’ẽva Europa-pe."" which translates to ""Sanskrit is an ancient language and is compared to Latin spoken in Europe.""  It also says, ""ha’eháicha avei, ha’e Europa-gua ñe’ẽnguéra taha’e francés térã español"" meaning ""like European languages such as French or Spanish"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Latín ñe’ẽ** (Latin language) - While Sanskrit *is compared to* Latin, the text states Sanskrit *influences* European languages, including Latin.
*   **C: Ñe’ẽ-kuéra ymaguare** (Ancient languages) - Too broad. The text specifically focuses on the connection to European languages.
*   **D: Ñe’ẽ-kuéra India-gua** (Indian languages) - The text mentions Sanskrit is a predecessor to many *modern Indian* languages, but the question asks about languages influenced *by* Sanskrit, which are European ones.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'ére okañyrei sánscristo?","The correct answer is **D: Jerarquía-gui**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Upéi Upanishads oñembyaty rire, sánscrito okañyrei jerarquía rupive."" This translates to ""After the Upanishads were developed, Sanskrit rose in a hierarchical manner."" 

The text directly links the rise of Sanskrit to a hierarchical structure established after the development of the Upanishads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oguerekopaitéva (Being complex):** While the passage notes Sanskrit is a complex language, it doesn't say this is *why* it rose in prominence.
*   **B: Migración ária-gui (Aryan migration):** The passage *mentions* Aryan migration as a theory about Sanskrit's origins, but doesn't state it's the reason for its later rise.
*   **C: Latín ñe’ẽ (Latin language):** The passage draws a *comparison* between Sanskrit and Latin, but doesn't say Latin caused Sanskrit to rise.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ã apytégui ha’e añetegua gravedad Io rehegua?","The correct answer is **A: Yvypegua gravedad ndeitirata sa'ive Io mba'egui** (Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity).

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** A person who weighs 90 kg on Earth weighs only 16 kg on Io. This means they are *much* lighter on Io.
* **Weight and Gravity:** Weight is directly related to gravity.  Lower weight means lower gravity.
* **Therefore:** Io has less gravity than Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Io gravedad ndeitirave, upéare ndevevuivéta** (Io's gravity is stronger, that's why you would be heavier) - This is the opposite of what the problem states.
* **C: Io gravedad ndeitirave, upéare ndepohyivéta** (Io's gravity is stronger, that's why you wouldn't be lighter) - Again, this contradicts the given information.
* **D: Yvypegua gravedad ndeitirataveta Io mba'égui** (Earth's gravity is weaker than Io's gravity) - This is the opposite of the correct relationship.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ã mba’e oje’évagui ohechauka porã pe jasy corteza?","The correct answer is **A: Ipekue hi’ag̃uĩvévo** (Its width).

Here's why:

The text specifically states the corteza (crust) has a width of 70 km at its narrowest point and 100 km at its widest. The question asks what describes the jasy corteza well, and its width is a defining characteristic mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ipo'ive altiplano výguio** (It slopes towards the altiplano) - While the text mentions it slopes *from* the altiplano, it doesn't define the corteza *by* this slope.
* **C: Sa'ive maría mombyryveháguivo** (Its highest point is Maria) -  Maria is a point *on* the corteza, not a defining characteristic *of* it.
* **D: Sa'ive maría altiplano výguio** (Its highest point is Maria towards the Altiplano) - Same reasoning as C. It describes a location *on* the corteza, not what the corteza *is*.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõ ipoguasuve jasy corteza?","The correct answer is **C: Altiplano výguio**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ipo’ive maría výguio ha ipoguasuve altiplano výguio."" which translates to ""It originates from Maria and extends to the altiplano.""  This directly answers the question of where the Earth's crust extends to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ag̃uĩvégotyo:** This means ""going towards"" and doesn't describe where the crust *extends* to.
* **B: Oïvehápe maría:** This means ""in Maria"" and indicates where it *originates* from, not where it extends to.
* **D: María výguio:**  Similar to B, this refers to the origin, not the extent.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui oĩ tapicha oguerovíava?","The correct answer is **A: Avakuéra oikundahama ambue mbyjape** (People who travel to other dimensions).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Oĩ heta tapicha ikera’yvotýpe tog̃uahẽ upe ára avakuéra oikundakuaáramo ambue mbyjápe..."" (There are many people in recent times who travel to the same day people go to another dimension...).  This directly refers to people *going* to other dimensions/worlds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Avakuéra ndoikundahakuaái ambue mundo oĩva** (People don't discover other worlds) - The passage suggests people *are* seeking/discovering other worlds, even if there's no proof.
* **C: Tekove oĩkuaa ambue planeta-pe** (Life exists on another planet) -  The passage mentions the *possibility* of extraterrestrial life, but it's not the core idea of who is traveling.
* **D: Mbyajakuéra ndamombyryeterei oĩ ojuehegui** (Dimensions don't overlap) - The passage describes dimensions overlapping (""ojoykeregua"").



"
Mba'e ipo'ive ohóvo eñemomombyryvévo kuarahy mbytégui?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gas ipo’ive ohóvo oñemomombyryvévo kuarahy mbytégui"" which translates to ""Gas is what starts to be emitted to shine the core of the sun.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Plasma:** While the sun *contains* plasma, the text says gas is what *starts* the shining process.
*   **B: Tata rendy:** ""Tata rendy"" means ""Father's light"" and refers to the photosphere, not what initiates the sun's shine.
*   **D: Ape:** ""Ape"" means water, which is not involved in the sun's shining process as described in the text.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicga, mba'e jahechakuaa kuarahýre yvyape ari?","The correct answer is **C: Fotósfera**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Kuarahýre jahecháva ñamañávo hese héra fotosfera, he’iséva “Tata rendy apu’a”.""  This directly translates to: ""The layer we see on the Sun's surface is called the photosphere, also known as 'Father's shining face'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ ape:**  This means ""a layer"", which is too general. The text specifically names *which* layer we see.
* **B: Plasma:** While the Sun *is* made of plasma, the text describes the photosphere as what we *see*.
* **D: Kuarahy mbyte:** This means ""Sun's core"".  We don't directly see the core of the Sun.



"
Mba'e opytyvõ Copérnico remimo'ã?,"The correct answer is **A: Venus fase-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi fase-kuéra oykeko Copérnico remimo’ã he’íva umi planeta-kuéra ojereha kuarahy rehe.""  This translates to ""The phases supported Copernicus's theory that the planets revolve around the sun.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Venus rape:** The text mentions Venus rape (transit) but says it was *observed* much later, not that it supported Copernicus's theory.
* **C: Kuarahy ojoguaha Venus-pe:**  The text doesn't say the sun *orbits* Venus. It says planets orbit the sun.
* **D: Kuarahy ojoguaha jasýpe:** Similar to C, this isn't the point the text is making about Copernicus's theory.



"
Mba'epa ohecha Galileo Galilei 1610-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus fase-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Galileo Galilei oipuru peteĩ telescopio ohecha hag̃uã Venus oguerekoha fase..."" (Galileo Galilei used a telescope to see Venus had phases...).  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jasy gotyo añónte omañáva kuarahy gotyo** - This describes *how* the phases appeared, not *what* Galileo saw.
* **C: Planeta-kuéra ojereha kuarahy rehe** - Galileo's observations *supported* Copernicus's theory about planets revolving around the sun, but he didn't directly *see* this theory. He saw the phases that provided evidence.
* **D: Venus rape** - Jeremiah Horrocks saw the transit of Venus, not Galileo.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõgui Ysyry guasu Amazonas ombyaty y?","The correct answer is **A: Ysyry michĩvévagui** (Through smaller rivers).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ombyatypaite y umi ysyry michĩvévagui."" which translates to ""It is formed by the smaller rivers."" This directly answers the question of how the Amazon River is formed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ysyry pukuvévagui** (Through covered rivers) - The text mentions it *is* a covered river, but doesn't say it's *formed* by them.
*   **C: Océano-rupi** (From the ocean) - The text says 20% of rivers that flow *to* the ocean originate in the Amazon, not the other way around.
*   **D: Mokõiha ysyry guasu tuichavévagui** (Through two large tributaries) - While the text mentions tributaries, it doesn't state that it's *formed* by only two. It says it has 8 and 2 large tributaries.



"
Mba'e mención ndaha'éi Río Amazona mba'e?,"The correct answer is **A: Mokõiha ysyry guasu pukuvéva** (One of the largest rivers in the world).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ysyry guasu Amazonas ha’e **mokõiha ysyry guasu tuichave ha ipukuvéva** yvy ápe ári."" (The Amazon River is **one of the largest and longest** rivers in the world.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ysyry tuichavéva** (Long river) - While true, the passage specifically says it's *one of the largest* not *just* long.
* **C: Ysyry pukuvéva** (Large river) -  Again, true, but not the specific detail highlighted as a key characteristic.
* **D: Ysyry ipevéva** (Deep river) - The passage mentions its depth (6 miles) but doesn't define it *by* that.  It's a characteristic, not its core description in this text.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva tembiapo pa'ũme ojapo sa'ive umi Venezuela-gua?,"The correct answer is **D: Servicio**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dos tercio umi Venezuela-gua hembiapóva apytépe oñemongu’e sector servicio-pe...""  This translates to ""Two thirds of the Venezuelan workforce are employed in the service sector.""

While petróleo (oil) is a major industry, and a significant part of exports, only 1% of the workforce is *directly* employed in the oil industry.  Agriculture and industry employ even smaller portions (a quarter and a fifth, respectively).  Therefore, the *largest* employment sector is services.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva tembiapo pa'ũme ojapo hetave umi Venezuela-gua?","The correct answer is **A: Servicio**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dos tercio umi Venezuela-gua hembiapóva apytépe oñemongu’e sector servicio-pe"" which translates to ""Two thirds of the Venezuelan workforce are employed in the service sector.""

This clearly indicates that the majority of Venezuelans work in the service sector. The other options represent smaller portions of the workforce:

*   **Agricultura:** Only a fifth work in agriculture.
*   **Industria:** Only a quarter work in industry.
*   **Petróleo:** Only one percent work in the oil industry.

The text states: ""Mbyjakuéra omimbi ha haku upe energía opoíva rupi, umi átomo hidrogeno ojoaju rupi **omoheñói hag̃ua elemento ipohyivéva**."" (The particles combine and release energy, hydrogen atoms join to **create a heavier element**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojejapo fusión rehegua reactor** (To build a fusion reactor) - While the text mentions researchers *trying* to build a reactor, it's not what the particles themselves *do*.
* **C: Ome'ẽ mimbi ha haku** (To give energy) - They *release* energy, but their primary function described is creation, not giving.
* **D: Ojapo átomo hidrogeno** (To create hydrogen atoms) - The text says they *use* hydrogen atoms, not create them.



"
Mba'erã oikóta ojejapóramo peteĩ fusión rehegua reactor ojeporukuaáva hekopete?,"The correct answer is **A: Hidrógeno**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...umi átomo hidrogeno ojoaju rupi omoheñói hag̃ua elemento ipohyivéva."" which translates to ""...the hydrogen atoms are used to create a heavier element.""  It also explains the reactor would utilize this process. Therefore, hydrogen is the key ingredient for a fusion reactor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbyja (Matter):** While matter is involved, hydrogen *is* the specific matter being used.
* **C: Átomo-kuéra (Atoms):**  Too general. Hydrogen atoms are the specific type of atom.
* **D: Energía (Energy):** Energy is *produced* by the reactor, not what it's made *from*.



"
Mba'e ha'e composición química y rehegua?,"The correct answer is **D: Mokõi hidrógeno átomo ha peteĩ oxígeno átomo rehe** (Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

The text states: ""Y compuesto-va oñemohenda mokõi hidrógeno átomo ha oxígeno átomo rehe."" which directly translates to ""And the compound is formed by two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""  This is the definition of water (H₂O).
"
"Y forma oñemoambuéramo jepe, mba'e noñemoambue mõ'ái?","The correct answer is **A: Estructura molecular**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jepéramo estado físico ikatu iñambue, estado químico noñemoambue kuaái.""  This translates to ""Even if the physical state can change, the chemical state doesn't change at all.""  The chemical state is determined by the **estructura molecular** (molecular structure).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pohýi (Color):**  Color is a physical property that *can* change with state.
* **C: Estado físico (Physical State):** The passage specifically says this *does* change.
* **D: Nitrógeno líquido (Liquid Nitrogen):** This is an example, not what remains constant.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""**Congreso ndaipokatúi omoĩ hag̃uã impuesto ha, ndapóri rupi peteĩ mburuvichavete...**"" which translates to ""Congress does not authorize to give taxes, there isn't a head executive,...""  This means the lack of Congressional power to impose taxes and appoint an executive is preventing the states from being properly governed and adhering to the Confederation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tavusu mburuvichakuéra rupi:** While the text mentions powerful individuals in the states, it states they *receive* assistance, not that they are the reason for the lack of laws.
* **C: Umi marandukuéra oguerekova’erã umi estado-kuéra ñemoneĩ:** The scholars recommend the states form a government, but they aren't *causing* the issues – the Confederation's weakness is the cause.
* **D: Ndapóri rupi peteĩ mburuvichavete:** The lack of an executive is a *result* of the problem, not the reason the states aren’t adhering to laws.

Mba'éichapa ojehai umi ñe'ẽ oĩva Independencia Independencia Ñemoñeï kupépe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ovakavõ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuatia Independencia Ñemoneĩ kupépe ojehai ko’ã ñe’ẽ “Independencia Ñemoneĩ ha’evéva 14 jasypokõi ary 1776-peguare” jehaipy ojekuaa yvygotyo, **ovakavõ**."" 

This directly translates to: ""On the Declaration of Independence, these words “The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776” are written **visibly**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tai tuichávape** - While the document *is* physically large, this doesn't describe *how* the words are presented.
*   **B: Código-pe** - This means ""in code,"" and the passage doesn't suggest the text is encoded.
*   **D: Michĩ** - This means ""hidden,"" which is the opposite of what the passage states.



"
Mba'ére ojeikuaave Singapúr-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín-kuéra rupi (Because of the gardens)**.

Here's why:

* **The text (P) directly states:** ""umi Jardín Botánico apo Singapúr-pe oipytyvõ pe isla-gui oiko hag̃ua peteĩ Ciudad Jardín tropical."" (The Botanical Gardens in Singapore help the island to be a tropical Garden City.)
* This clearly indicates that Singapore is famous *because of its gardens*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jeguata rupi (Because of the food):** The text doesn't mention food.
* **C: Deporte de aventura rupi (Because of adventure sports):** The text doesn't mention sports.
* **D: Arte escénico rupi (Because of performing arts):** The text doesn't mention performing arts.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""1981 arýpe, Vanda Miss Joaquim, **híbrido de orquídeas**, ojeiporavo tetã yvotýramo.""  This translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a **hybrid of orchids**, was chosen as the national flower.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ isla** (An island) - The text mentions islands in relation to Singapore, but Vanda Miss Joaquim is *on* the island, not an island itself.
*   **C: Peteĩ jadín botánico** (A botanical garden) - The text mentions botanical gardens, but Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower found *in* those gardens.
*   **D: Peteĩ monumento** (A monument) - While it's a national symbol, it's specifically identified as a flower.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Giza pirámides, araka’eve ndojehupytýiva ituichakue ijejapo porãmbýpe.""  This translates to ""...Giza pyramids, even though they didn't finish building them perfectly.""
* **The question asks:** What is something impressive about the Giza pyramids that isn't shown in the later Egyptian Empire?
* **""Ituicháha"" (didn't finish)** directly answers this - the Giza pyramids were built with a level of skill and ambition that wasn't replicated *completely* in later empires, even though they didn't finish them to a perfect standard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hi ary (Long time):** While the pyramids are old, the passage doesn't focus on their age as a unique feature.
* **B: Ita jeporu (Good work):** The passage implies they weren't *perfectly* finished, so ""good work"" isn't the point.
* **D: Ijejapo (To build):** The fact that they were built isn't what makes them special; it's *how* and *that they weren’t completely finished to a perfect standard* as the passage points out.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõguipa ou ka'avo'uha okyeterei rupi?","The correct answer is **C: Sur llanura-kuéragui**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...amo 1,5 millones mymba ka’avo’uha oho **sur gotyo** umi llanura-pe..."" which translates to ""...approximately 1.5 million animals head **south** to the plains...""

Therefore, the animals travel *from* the south plains.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, moõgui ka'avo'uha oho jasyrundi rupi?","The correct answer is **A: Serengeti región-gui**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Serengeti región oreko Parque Nacional de Serengeti, peteĩ Ngorongoro Área de Conservación ha Reserva de Caza Maswa Tanzania-pe ha Reserva Nacional de Maasai Mara Kenia-pe.""  This means the migration *ends up* in the Serengeti region after traveling through the plains and crossing the Mara River.  The question asks *where* the animals go in jasyrundy (dry season), and the text clearly links the region to the end of their journey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sur llanura-kuéragui** - The plains are where the migration *starts*, not where it ends up in the dry season.
*   **C: Río Mara-gui** - They cross the Mara River, but don't *stay* there.
*   **D: Reserva Nacional de Maasai Mara-gui** - This is part of the Serengeti region, but the broader answer is the region itself.



"
"Pe Operación Sealion, moõgua tetã jeike ha’e raka'e?","The correct answer is **A: Alemania-pe**.

The text states: ""Alemania ombohéra ijeroike """"Operación Sealion""""."" which translates to ""Germany named its plan """"Operation Sealion"""".  Therefore, Operation Sealion was a German operation.

The text explicitly states: ""Alemania ombohéra ijeroike """"Operación Sealion""""."" (Germany named its operation ""Operation Sealion"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dunkerque** - Dunkerque is a location where British troops escaped, not the name of the German operation.
* **C: Kriegsmarine** - This is the name of the German navy.
* **D: Royal Navy** - This is the British navy, opposing the German operation.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ojapyhy hag̃uã umi tetãnguéra oguerekova’erã peteĩ plataforma tropa-kuéra, ikatuhag̃uãicha oike Mar Mediterráneo rupive ha ohekojopy Africa-pe.""  This directly translates to ""To help the African countries, it would have a platform for troops, allowing them to travel across the Mediterranean Sea and project into Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ohejarei ygarata Egiptope** (It would attack bases in Egypt) - While the text mentions potentially attacking British bases in Egypt *after* establishing the platform, it's not the *reason* for helping the African nations.
* **B: Ojapova'erã hetave ygarata pyahu** (It would make many naval attacks) - The text mentions Italy made only four naval attacks before the war, not that it *would* make many.
* **D: Ohundiva'erã umi base Británica** (It would destroy British bases) -  Similar to A, this is a potential *consequence* not the *purpose* of helping African nations.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba’epa raka’e ojapose Italia pe ñorairõhápe?","The correct answer is **A: Ojapyhy tetãnguéra África-pegua** (It supports African countries).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Italia ohupytyse umi Africa-pegua tetãnguéra. Ojapyhy hag̃uã umi tetãnguéra oguerekova’erã peteĩ plataforma tropa-kuéra..."" (Italy supports the African countries. To allow those countries to have a troop platform...). This directly indicates Italy's role is to support African nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Omopu’ã peteĩ ejército imbareteveva ha ygarata** (It has a strong army and fleet) - While true, the text doesn't focus on *having* a strong army as its primary role, but what it *does* with it.
* **C: Ohejarei umi ygarata Egipto-gua** (It attacks Egyptian fleets) - The text says it *would* attack British fleets in Egypt, not Egyptian fleets.
* **D: Oreko hag̃ua base Gran Bretaña-pe** (To have a base in Great Britain) -  The text says Japan is like Great Britain (an island nation), not that Italy is trying to establish a base there.

This translates to: ""This refers to the French who surrendered to the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders and did not fight against them.""  The text then identifies these French as those of ""Vichy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alemán-kuéra (Germans)** - The text says the *French* surrendered *to* the Germans, not that the Germans surrendered.
* **C: Estadounidense-kuéra (Americans)** - The text mentions Americans later in the context of Operation Dragon, fighting *against* the Germans, not collaborating.
* **D: Francia-guáva isãsomava (French who surrendered)** - While they surrendered, the text specifically identifies them as the ""Vichy French"" who *collaborated* with the invaders.



"
Máva oĩ ra'e Operación Dragón ryepype?,"The correct answer is **A: Estadounidense ha Francia-guáva isãsomava** (Americans and Free French).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mokõi arapokõindy ryepýpe, umi estadounidense ha Francia-guáva isãsõmáva, omosãsõ avei Francia sur-pe ha ohoitéma hikuái Alemania gotyo."" This directly translates to ""In the second phase, the Americans and Free French landed also in Southern France and moved towards Germany.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi francés Vicky ha Estadounidense-kuéra** - ""Vichy"" refers to the collaborating French government, not the Free French forces involved in Operation Dragoon.
* **C: Alemania ha Francia-guáva** - Germany was the *enemy* in Operation Dragoon, not a participant.
* **D: Estadounidense ha Alemán-kuéra** -  Again, Germany was the enemy.



"
Mba'e oñembokatypyryve rupi submarino-kuéra oñapymĩ?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ñorãirõ ñepyrũme, opavave submarino oikundaha ysyry guasu ári, **hakatu radar oñembokatypyryvépe, umi submarino-kuéra oñapymĩma ojehecha’ỹhag̃uãicha**."" 

This translates to: ""At the beginning of the war, all submarines were positioned in large rivers, **but as radar improved, the submarines became easier to detect.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boats** - U-Boats are the *name* of the German submarines, not what made them easier to detect.
*   **B: Mbokapu mombyry** - (Lack of torpedoes) - The text mentions a lack of torpedoes as a later problem, not the initial reason for detection.
*   **C: Ygarata** - (Smoke) - While submarines do create some smoke, the text doesn't link it to being detected.



"
"Ojeporu tenondérõguare submarino, mba'e ne'ĩra gueteri mombyry?","The correct answer is **A: Ygarata**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upéramo guare imbegue gueteri hikuái ha **nombo**kapúi gueteri mombyry. Ñorãirõ ñepyrũme...""  This translates to ""But now there are few left and **they don't have** much strength. At the beginning of the war...""

The question asks what the submarines *lack* or don't have.  ""Ygarata"" (strength/energy) is the direct opposite of ""nomboikapúi"" (don't have strength).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jeho (Sound):** The text doesn't mention a lack of sound.  In fact, stealth is implied.
* **C: Mbokapu (Cover):**  While submarines try to be covered/hidden, the text focuses on a lack of *strength*.
* **D: Jeporu (Use/Purpose):** The text doesn't say they lack a purpose, only that they are dwindling in number and strength.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva opyrũ py'aguapy ñe'ẽme'ẽ ári? ","The correct answer is **D: Unión Soviética-gua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...800.000 soldado Ejercito pytã Unión Soviéticaguáva oike ha ojapo mokõi frente Bielorrusia-gua ha Ucrania-gua ojepo rire invasión Polonia región oriental opyrũvo Riga py'aguapy ñe'ẽme'ẽ...""  This directly translates to ""...800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Army arrived and created two fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after the invasion of eastern Poland began with the Riga agreement...""

Therefore, the Soviet Union initiated the agreement mentioned in the text.



"
Mávapa ko’ã apytégui ndojapóiva’ekue Ejército pytã?,"The correct answer is **B: Invasión región oriental-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states the Soviet army created two fronts (Bielorrusia and Ucrania) *after* invading the eastern region of Poland.  This means the invasion of the eastern region is what the army *did*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ojapo Ucrania-gua frente:** While true, this is *where* they acted, not *what* they did. Creating a front is a consequence of the invasion.
*   **C: Oñembyaty jey pe puente akãme:** This refers to an attempted defense by Poland, not an action of the Soviet army.
*   **D: Opyrũ py'aguapy ñe'ẽme'ẽ ári:**  This describes the context of the invasion (no treaties), but isn't *what* the army did.



"
Mba'e ojehu Ingeniero Mburuvicha Paha Ejército Italia-guape?,"The correct answer is **A: Oity chupe hikuái Fuerte Capuzzo-pe** (He was captured near Fuerte Capuzzo).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...umi Británico oity Ingeniero Mburuvicha Paha Ejército Italia-gua, General Lastucci-pe.""  This translates to ""...the British captured the Head Engineer of the Italian Army, General Lastucci, near Fuerte Capuzzo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojejuka Tobruk-pe** (He went to Tobruk) - The text says Italo Balbo went to Tobruk, not General Lastucci.
* **C: Oity chupe Britanico-kuéra** (The British captured him) - While the British *did* capture him, this isn't what the text specifically states he *was doing*.  The question asks where he was captured.
* **D: Ojuka chupe tata rendy** (His father called him) - This is not mentioned in the text.



"
Moõ ojejuka Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk-pe**.

The text states: ""Pe Jasypoteĩ 28 pe, Mburuvicha Italo Balbo... ojejuka peteĩ angirũ jejapipe oguejy jave Tobrukpe."" This translates to: ""On June 28, General Italo Balbo... embarked on a reconnaissance journey towards Tobruk.""

Therefore, Italo Balbo embarked *towards* Tobruk.

"""Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'éichapa chakra oñemomba'apo meditación tibetana """"rendaite"""" aja?""","The correct answer is **B: Deidad jehecha** (Visualizing deities).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Meditación tibetana rendaite hína Deida Yoga. Mba'ejehecha rupi heta deidad omopotĩ energía rape, oñemyandy chakras-kuéra ha ojejapo iluminación andu."" 

This translates to: ""Tibetan meditation is based on Deity Yoga. Specifically, through the visualization of many deities, energy is channeled, chakras are worked with, and enlightenment is achieved.""

Therefore, the key to how chakras are impacted in this type of meditation is the **visualization of deities**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yoga postura guive** (Through yoga postures) - While Kundalini yoga *is* mentioned, it's not specifically how the ""rendaite"" (deity yoga) meditation works with chakras.
*   **C: Mantra apo** (Chanting mantras) - Mantras are *part* of the practice, but not the central way chakras are engaged.
*   **D: Pytyhẽ apo** (Breathing exercises) - Breathing exercises are also part of the practice, but again, not the core mechanism for chakra work in deity yoga.

Máva opurahéi canción devocional tembi'u ñeikuave'ẽ jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oñeikuave’ẽ Baba Shyam-pe 108 tembi’u Chhappan Bhog rehegua... Lakkha Singh avei omoguahẽ chhappan bhog bhajan.""  This translates to ""108 items of the Chhappan Bhog are offered to Baba Shyam... Lakkha Singh also performs the Chhappan Bhog bhajan.""

Therefore, Lakkha Singh is the one who performs the devotional song related to offering the food (tembi'u) to the deity.



"
Mávapa ha’eva’ekue pe penúltimo espectáculo ko pyharépe?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina ha Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Diva Tuquía-gua omoha'ãnga kuri tenor italiagua Alessandro Safina ha puraheihára Grecia-gua Haris Alexiou.""  And earlier it mentions ""Sezen Aksu"". These three are presented as the featured performers *in addition* to the others mentioned.

The question asks for the *penultimate* (second to last) spectacle, and these three are the final, important performers listed before the description of the overall spectacle (Troya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Anatolia** - Anatolia is a Turkish band performing *as part of* the spectacle, not the spectacle itself.
*   **C: Deviche Jere** - These are dancers who appear on stage.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç ha Müslüm Gürses** - They are singers, but not presented as the last set of performers before the main spectacle description.



"
Moõ tetãgua ha'e Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Italia-gua**.

The text states: ""Diva Tuquía-gua omoha'ãnga kuri **tenor italiagua Alessandro Safina**..."" which translates to ""A Turkish diva will share the stage with **Italian tenor Alessandro Safina**...""

Therefore, Alessandro Safina is Italian."
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mávapa ko’ã apytégui hina ha’e ñe'ẽrei?","The correct answer is **C: Pasajero oñemboy'u** (A passenger was rescued).

Here's why:

* **The passage is primarily about a passenger who needed to be rescued due to the heat.** The entire text revolves around this event - the high temperature, the firefighter's statement, and the situation requiring a rescue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiko tata guasu Santa Clara-pe (There is a large city in Santa Clara):** While Santa Clara is mentioned as the location, it's not the main subject of the text.
* **B: Avakuéra opa'ã peteĩ montaña rusa-pe (People were all on a roller coaster):** The roller coaster is mentioned as a *part* of the situation (being a hot place), but people weren't necessarily *on* it during the rescue.
* **D: Sa’ivérõ hi’are kuri peteĩ aravo oñeguenohẽ ypy hag̃ua peteĩ tapicha upégui (It's very hot and a day to get help for someone):** This describes the *conditions* but isn't the core event being reported.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa he'i pe temperatura noĩporãiva rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Montaña rusa omomba'apóva** (The operating roller coaster).

Here's why:

The passage states the heat is causing issues with a roller coaster: ""...sapy’aite jepe epytáramo esẽkuaa’ỹre peteĩ montaña rusa-pe ijetu’úta..."" (Even if you try to look for shade under a roller coaster...).  This implies the roller coaster itself is affected by the heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bombero-kuéra moakãha (Firefighters):** While a firefighter is quoted, the passage isn't *about* them and their ideal temperature.
* **C: Pasajero-kuéra (Passengers):** The passage mentions passengers, but doesn't focus on what temperature is best *for them*. It's about the impact of the heat.
* **D: Tahachi-kuéra moakãha (Operators):** While operators would be involved, the passage doesn't specifically say what temperature *they* prefer. It’s about the roller coaster’s operation in the heat.



"
Moõpa oiko kuri apañuãi energía rehegua tsunami rupive?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Noñemomarandúi ñembyai vai térã pane Tonga-pe, electricidad katu ohókuri sapy'ami..."" which translates to ""There is no news of damage or good in Tonga, but electricity is out everywhere..."" This indicates a direct impact from the tsunami in Tonga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Niue-pe:** The text mentions a tsunami warning for Niue, but not direct impact.
* **C: Mbo'ehaokuera Hawaii-pe:** The text says students in Hawaii are being prepared, but they haven't *experienced* the tsunami yet.
* **D: Pago Pago-pe:** The text mentions a tsunami warning for Pago Pago, but not direct impact.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e oiko Tonga-pe oho haguére electricidad?","The correct answer is **D: Tendota Togan-gua ndoikuaái Tsunami ñemomarandu**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""pévagui tendota Togan-gua ndoikuaái Tsunami ñemomarandu og̃uenohẽva'ekue PTWC.""  This translates to ""even though the leaders of Tonga didn't know about the Tsunami warning sent by PTWC."" This directly answers the question of *why* the electricity was still on in Tonga – because they weren't aware of the warning to turn it off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñemomarandu sa’i ñembyai:** (There was a small damage report) - While damage might have occurred, the text doesn't link this to the electricity being on.
* **B: Tendotakuéra ndohupytýi marandu umi advertencia ojeipe'áva rehe:** (The leaders didn't understand the warnings being given) - The text states they *didn't know* about the warning, not that they didn't understand it.
* **C: Para retakue ojeafecta:** (The infrastructure was affected) - This isn't directly stated as a reason for the electricity being on.



"
Araka'e rire ikatu ra'e tahachi oiporu imboka radar kuera oikuaa hag̃ua mba'e hatãpa oho kuri Karai Reid?,"The correct answer is **C: Ohasávo 160 km/h**

Here's why:

The text states that the New Zealand A1GP team wants to use the radar to find out *how fast* (or at what speed - *oikuaa hag̃ua mba'e hatãpa*) Karai Reid and Black Beauty were going.  It specifically mentions they want to know if they exceeded 160 km/h while crossing the Auckland Harbour Bridge.  Therefore, the reason for using the radar is to confirm if they *passed* (or were going at) 160 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ohóvo aja 160 km/h:** This just says ""going only 160 km/h"" - the team wants to know if they went *over* that speed.
* **B: Pokõi jehasa rire upe puente ári:** This means ""after crossing the bridge"" - the speed *while* crossing is what matters.
* **D: Peteĩ jehasa rire upe puente ári:** This means ""after a crossing of the bridge"" - again, the speed *during* the specific crossing is the point.



"
"Ko maranduha he’iháicha, mba'ére hasy ra'e tahachípe oikuaa hag̃ua Johnny Reid mba'e hatãpa oho?","The correct answer is **A: Oho rupi sa'ive 160 km/h-gui**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the police want to use radar to find out *how fast* Jonny Reid was going (""mba'e hatãpa oho kuri Karai Reid""). It then directly links this to his speed of 160 km/h (""oipuru haguã upe imboka radar kuera oikuaa haguã mba'e hatãpa oho kuri Karai Reid ikarapere Black Beauty, ha umi tahachi ikatu ocronometra kuri peteĩha añoite Karai Reidpe ha'e kuri ha'e omboguejyvo imboguata 160 km/hpe"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imba'yru mbegue rupi:** The text mentions the car race, but doesn't state the police are interested in *that* specifically.
* **C: Puente ári pokõijeynte ohasa:**  The text mentions crossing the bridge, but not as the reason for the police's investigation.
* **D: Pe Puente Auckland Harbour ituja:** The text mentions the bridge itself, but the police are concerned with speed, not just that he was *on* the bridge.

Moõ oñemopyenda raka'e pe yvyryrýi Butte rehehápe?,"The correct answer is **D: 65 milla yvategotyo**.

The text states: ""Yvyryrýi oiko'ypy 20 kilómetro (15 milla) Dillon yvate-yvate ha kuarahy resẽ gotyope ha **65 kilómetro (40 milla) rupi Butte yvy gotyope**.""

This directly translates to: ""The peak is 20 kilometers (15 miles) north of Dillon and to the southeast, and **65 kilometers (40 miles) from Butte**.""  Since the question asks for the distance *to* Butte, and the text gives 65 kilometers (which is approximately 40 miles), option D is the closest and most accurate answer.

"
Mba'epa oikova’ekue Abu Ghraib-pe motín jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapicha monambipyre kuera abuso**.

Here's why:

The passage states the riots at Abu Ghraib were *caused by* the abuse of prisoners by American soldiers. The question asks what happened *during* the riots. The abuse of prisoners is the direct trigger and central event described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemboty (Rebellion/Mutiny):** While a riot *is* a form of rebellion, the passage doesn't say the riot *was* a rebellion itself, but rather what *caused* it.
* **C: Milíko americano opyta cargope (American soldiers were on duty):**  This is true, but doesn't explain *what happened* during the riot - they were there *before* and were the cause of it.
* **D: Ka'irãi oñemyendypa (The prison was damaged):** The damage is a *result* of the riot, not what *happened* during it.



"
Mba'ére ojeikuaa ka'irãi Irak-pegua? ,"The correct answer is **D: Tapicha monambipyre kuera abuso**.

Here's why:

The passage states the prison is ""known for the abuse suffered by people there at the hands of American military personnel."" This directly answers the question of *what* the Iraqi prison is known for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñemyendypa rupi (Because it was built)** - While the prison *was* built, the passage focuses on what it's *known for* now, not its construction.
* **B: Milíko americano opyta cargope (American military personnel are stationed there)** - This is a fact mentioned in the passage, but not *what it's known for*.
* **C: Oiko heta motín (There are many riots)** - The passage mentions a riot, but doesn't say it's what the prison is generally known for.



"
Mba'éichagua jeguerohyhapa oiko ra'e Estado Maui War Memorial-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñembopu**.

Here's why:

* The text states the musician is performing a ""**ñembopu**"" (concert) at the Estado Maui War Memorial. The whole passage revolves around this concert and the logistics of hosting it for 9,000 people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mágico jehechauka** (Magic show) - The text doesn't mention a magic show.
* **B: Vakapipopo ñembosarái** (Fundraising event) - While events *can* be fundraisers, the text focuses on the performance itself, not a fundraising aspect.
* **D: Viru ñembyaty** (Party) -  A concert is more formal than a simple party, especially one planned for 9,000 attendees.



"
Mávapa ome'ẽ kuri ñe’ẽmombe’u mba'érepa oñembopa upe ñembopu?,"The correct answer is **B: Músico rendota mba'apoha (The musician's management company)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upe músico rendota mba'apoha, HK Management Inc., nome'ẽi ñepyrũra mba'érepa ombopaha 20 Jasyporundypegua..."" This directly translates to ""The musician's management company, HK Management Inc., provided the reason for postponing the concert on July 20th..."" 

Therefore, the management company is the one who gave the reason for the postponement.



"
Mávapa oimo'ã heta tapicha oikóva Bishkek-pe ha’eha responsable pe ñemondagui?,"The correct answer is **C: Ojepytasova** (Those who plotted/conspired).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Heta tapicha oikóva Bishkek-pe omboja umi ojepytasóvare ha'éva yvy gotyogua upe mburuvicha'ỹre.""  This translates to ""Many people living in Bishkek join those who plotted/conspired, making the ground tremble with that 'strongman'.""

Therefore, the people who *plotted* are considered responsible for the events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tahachikuéra (The authorities):** While the authorities might be involved *after* the event, the passage doesn't initially present them as the originators of the trouble.
* **B: Mba'erepy ñemuha (The reason for the war):**  The reason for the war is a *cause*, not a responsible party.
* **D: Mitãrusukuéra (Children):**  Children are not mentioned as being responsible.



"
Mávapa omboja umi ojepytasóvare ñemonda?,"The correct answer is **D: Yvypóra aty**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Heta tapicha oikóva Bishkek-pe omboja umi ojepytasóvare ha'éva yvy gotyogua upe mburuvicha'ỹre."" which translates to ""Many people living in Bishkek join those who suffered, living on the land around that 'lord'.""  This clearly indicates the people of Bishkek are joining/allying with the *people* who have suffered (the ""ojepytasóvare"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bishkek-gua:** Bishkek is the *location* of the people joining, not who they are joining *with*.
*   **B: Tahachikuéra:** The passage mentions ""tahachikuéra"" (those who aren't there) in relation to not being in Bishkek, not as who the people are joining.
*   **C: Anarquista-kuéra:**  The passage does not mention anarchists.



"
Araka'e ojupi ñemu?,"The correct answer is **A: Osẽ rire Shark Tank episodio-pe**.

The text states: ""Siminoff he'íkuri pe ñemu ojupi tuicha ha'e osẽ rire Shark Tank episodio-pe 2013-pe..."" which translates to ""Siminoff said the business grew a lot after appearing on the Shark Tank episode in 2013...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oñeme'ẽ rupi chupe pirapire 2013-pe** (Receiving funding in 2013) - While he *received* funding in 2013, the text says the business *grew* after the show, not that the funding itself was the start of the growth.
* **C: Osẽ rire QVC-pe** (After appearing on QVC) - The QVC appearance happened *later* in 2017.
* **D: Omohenda rire peteĩ demanda mba'apoha ADT-ndive** (After filing a lawsuit with ADT) - This is related to the business later on, not the initial growth.



"
Araka'e Jamie Siminoff omoñerypũ Ring?,"The correct answer is **B: Osẽ vai rire Shark Tank rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Siminoff he'íkuri pe ñemu ojupi tuicha ha'e osẽ rire Shark Tank episodio-pe 2013-pe, upépe umi show panel-pegua ombotovékuri ome'ẽ hag̃ua chupe pirapire oñepyrũ hag̃ua iñemuha.""  This translates to: ""Siminoff said the business took off after he appeared on the Shark Tank episode in 2013, where the show's panel liked it and offered him funding to start the business.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Itimbre ndoiko porãi rupi** (The doorbell didn't work well) - This is about the *problem* Ring solved, not how it started.
*   **C: Oñeme'ẽ rupi chupe pirapire** (He was given funding) - While he *received* funding, this was a *result* of appearing on Shark Tank, not the start of Ring.
*   **D: Osẽ porã rire QVC-pe** (He did well on QVC) - QVC happened *later* (2017), after the initial success following Shark Tank.



"
Mba'e recomendación ome'ẽ peteĩteĩ episodio-kuéra Lectura de Arco Iris-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Biblioteca local-kuéra (Local libraries)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peteĩteĩ Show avei ome'ẽta hina recomendación mitã peguarã kuatiañe'ẽ ha'ekuéra oheka vaerã oho jave upe bibliotecape.""  This translates to: ""The show also gave a recommendation for children to read books and to see them go to the library.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ta'ãngambyry programa-kuéra (Program content):** The show *features* content, but doesn't recommend it as a place to go.
*   **C: Tema-kuéra (Themes):** The show uses themes to teach, but doesn't recommend them specifically.
*   **D: Kuatiañe'ẽkuéra (Books):** The show encourages reading books, but the *recommendation* is to go to the library to find them.



"
Mba'e ocontribuine ra'e Lectura de Arco Iris opa hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **C: John Grant he'íva**.

Here's why:

The passage states that John Grant believes ""Lectura de Arco Iris"" teaches children *how* to read and encourages them to take a book home. He also emphasizes its contribution to children having a book and being able to read it. This directly addresses what Lectura de Arco Iris contributes to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndaipóri pirapire** (There is no answer) - This is a meta-statement and not an answer derived from the text.
*   **B: Ndorekói rupi premio Emmy** (Doesn't win Emmy awards) - While the passage mentions PBS winning Emmys, it doesn't say *Lectura de Arco Iris* specifically won any.
*   **D: Mister Roger's Neighborhood-pe oho porãve rupi** (Goes well on Mister Roger's Neighborhood) - The passage mentions these shows alongside each other, but doesn't imply *Lectura de Arco Iris* contributes to *Mister Roger's Neighborhood*.



"

Here's why:

The passage states Anne Frank *he'i pe yvyrarakãme ombohasyha peteĩ urupe ha upéva ikatu ombyai avaetagua resãi, he'ívo upéva ho'apotaiteha.*  This translates to: ""Told the diary she confided in a secret and that could get people in trouble, saying she trusted it.""

The question asks what Anne Frank did with the diary, and the passage clearly states she *confided* in it.  The other options are things *about* the secret, not what she *did* with the diary itself.

* **B: Ojeñangarekova'erã hese** (It was carefully hidden) - True, but not what the passage focuses on regarding *her action*.
* **C: Ombohasyha peteĩ urupe** (She revealed a secret) - This is *what* she told the diary, not what she did *with* it.
* **D: Ikatu ombyai avaetagua resãi** (It could get people in trouble) - This is a consequence of the secret, not her action.



"
"RSPCA inspector mbohapehára rupive, mba'e rehe ojesareko meme va'erä?","The correct answer is **D: Mymba jejukaha** (Animals suffering).

Here's why:

The text states: ""RSPCA inspector mbohapehára Nueva Gales Sur-guáva, David O'Shannessy, he'i kuri ABC-pe **ñeñangareko ha jesareko mymba jejukaha** rehe ojejapo meme va'erãha Australia-pe.""  This directly translates to ""RSPCA inspector... said on ABC about **suffering and neglected animals** that memes are being made about it in Australia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: CCTV cámara:** The cameras *show* the suffering, they aren't what's being made fun of.
*   **B: Tapicha omba'apóva mbymba ndivepe:** The people interacting with animals are involved, but the memes are *about* the animals' suffering.
*   **C: Ñeñangareko renda:**  ""Neglect"" is *part* of what's being memed, but ""mymba jejukaha"" (suffering animals) is the broader and more accurate answer.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""CCVT añetehápe oikuaauka mbaretéta umi tapicha omba'apóva mbymba ndivepe ijeguerekoporã tuicha mba'eha."" This translates to ""The CCTV footage shows a lot about the people who abuse animals significantly.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñembyaty RSPCA-gua ndive** - While the RSPCA is involved, the text doesn't say the RSPCA reveals what people do.
* **C: Jehesareko meme mymba jejukaha rehe** -  This refers to sharing information *about* animal abuse, not what the footage *shows* about the abusers.
* **D: ABC-guive jehesareko** - ABC is where the inspector *spoke* about the issue, not what reveals information about abusers.



"
"Ko maranduha he’iháicha, mba'e profesión-gua ha’eva'ekue pe ojedeteneva?","The correct answer is **A: Estudiante**.

The text states ""ambue estudiante ojearresta avei pe mbo'ehao ñembokapu reheguare oiko vaekue 21 Jasyapype"" which translates to ""another student was also arrested regarding the school shooting that occurred on the 21st."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peteĩ fuente Mineapolis Star-Tribune-pegua** - This refers to a *source* for the news, not the person arrested.
* **C: Mburuvicha pe Tribu-pegua** - The text mentions Floyd Jourdain, the tribal chairman, as the father of the arrested individual, but not as the arrested person themselves.
* **D: Autoridad Red Lake-pegua** -  Authorities confirmed the arrest but weren't the one arrested.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháica, mboy víctima funeral pa oiko hina ra'e ojedetenévoguare hína ambuepe?","The correct answer is **C: Porundy**.

The text states: ""Pe marandu omosarambi hina ape comunidad Red Lake pe ko árape Jeff Weise funeral pe ha **ambue mbohapy victima porundy** apytegui ojedetene..."" which translates to ""The report details how the Red Lake community is dealing with Jeff Weise's funeral and **another four victims** were identified...""

Therefore, the answer is four victims (""porundy"" means four in Guarani)."
"Ko'ã protesta rupi, mba'e tetã ndofirmái kuri pe acuerdo ACTA?","The correct answer is **B: Polonia**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Pe Jasy ohasa vaekue, oiko peteĩ protesta tuichava Polonia pe upe tetã ofirma kuri ACTA, ha pea ogueraha kuri pe gobierno polaco ani haguã oratifica ko acuerdo ko'agã.""  This translates to: ""Next February, a large protest will take place in Poland because the country signed ACTA, and people are asking the Polish government not to ratify this agreement this month.""

While protests occurred in other countries, Poland is the only one explicitly mentioned as having *signed* ACTA and facing pressure not to ratify it.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ã tetã apytépe omombegue upe proceso oike hag̃ua ACTA-pe?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""Latvia ha Eslovaquia mokõiveva omombegue hina pe proceso jeike haguã ACTApe."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia are both reconsidering the process to join ACTA.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia** - The text only mentions a protest *in* Estonia, not reconsideration of joining ACTA.
*   **B: Lituania** - The text only mentions a protest *in* Lithuania, not reconsideration of joining ACTA.
*   **C: Escocia** - The text only mentions protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland), not reconsideration of joining ACTA.



"
Mboy tapicha okai'imi iPod osẽ vaíva ombuakupahaguépe rupi?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ha poteĩ ñemyandy oñepyrũva ha oheja **irundy tapicha** okai'imíva rehe.""  ""Irundy"" means four in Guarani.

Therefore, four people were injured due to exploding iPods according to the initial report. While other numbers are mentioned (60 cases, 27 reports, 34 incidents), the question specifically asks about *people injured*.



"
Máva he'i incidente ombuakupahaguépe ndaha'eiha tuicha mba'e?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arapokõindy ohasa va'ekuépe Apple omomarandu kuri ambue 34 incidente ombuakupahaguépe, ha ñemuha he'i kuri ndaha'eiha tuicha mba'e."" 

This translates to: ""According to reports, Apple reported another 34 incidents of overheating, and they said it wasn't a big deal.""

Therefore, Apple is the one who said the incidents weren't a big deal.



"
"Oñe'ẽ aja, mba'e he'i Steve Jobs Apple ombopyahujeýtaha?","The correct answer is **B: Ñe'ẽmbyry**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states Steve Jobs said: """"Ko árape Apple ombopyahujeýta **ñe'ẽmbyry**, ore rojapóta marandekohai ko árape"""" which translates to """"Today Apple is presenting **software**, we are reinventing the phone today.""

The question (Q) asks what Steve Jobs said Apple was presenting. The passage directly states it's *ñe'ẽmbyry* (software).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marandekohai** - Means ""reinvention"" - Jobs says they *are doing* the reinvention, not *presenting* it.
*   **C: Tembiaporenda** - Means ""technology"" - While the iPhone *uses* technology, Jobs specifically mentions software.
*   **D: Tecnología** - Same as C.



"
Mba'ére Steve Jobs oñe'ẽ mokõi aravo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ohechauka hag̃ua ñe'ẽmbyry pyahu** (To introduce a new software).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states Jobs was presenting the device that would eventually become the iPhone and then quotes him saying: """"Ko árape Apple ombopyahujeýta ñe'ẽmbyry, ore rojapóta marandekohai ko árape"""" which translates to """"Today Apple is reinventing the phone, and we're going to change everything today.""""  This clearly indicates he was introducing *software* – a new way of thinking about phones and their capabilities (the software).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ohechauka hag̃ua tablet pyahu** (To introduce a new tablet) - While Apple later made tablets, the passage is specifically about the device *before* the iPhone, and focuses on changing the phone itself.
*   **B: Ohechauka hag̃ua computadora pyahu** (To introduce a new computer) - The passage doesn't mention computers.
*   **D: Oikuaauka hag̃ua iretiro** (To announce his retirement) - There's nothing in the passage to suggest this.



"
Mba'e omomarandu Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner Argentina Teatro-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Omomarandu kuri iñintención oñanitaha senadorarã** (She announced her intention to run for senator).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ña Kirchner omomarandu kuri iñintencion oñanitaha mburuvichara Argentina Teatrope..."" which directly translates to ""Kirchner announced her intention to run for senator at the Argentina Theater...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojecandidataha mburuvichara** (She is a candidate for governor) - The passage says *senator*, not governor.
* **C: Icampaña provincia Buenos Aires atyhápe oikóvaguáicha** (Her campaign to live in Buenos Aires province) - The campaign is *from* Buenos Aires province, not *to live* there.
* **D: Omomarandu hag̃ua iretiro senado-gui** (To announce her retirement from the senate) - The passage indicates she is running *for* senator, not retiring.



"
Moõ kuri Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner omomarandu iñintencion oñanitaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Argentina Teatro-pe opytáva 31 milla Buenos Aires-gui**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ña Kirchner omomarandu kuri iñintencion oñanitaha mburuvichara Argentina Teatrope...""  This directly translates to ""Kirchner announced her intention to run for office at the Argentina Theater...""
* **It also clarifies the location:** ""...upe tenda voi oipuru vaekue oñepyrũ haguã icampaña 2005pe Senadope guara Buenos Aires provincia atyhápe oikova guaicha."" This means the theater is related to a campaign launch in Buenos Aires province, which is near Buenos Aires.  The distance of 31 miles to Buenos Aires is also mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ teatro opytáva 31 milla La Plata-gui** - The theater isn't 31 miles from La Plata, it's related to Buenos Aires.
* **B: Teatro Buenos Aires oĩva La Plata-pe** - The theater isn't in La Plata.
* **D: Teatro La Plata oĩva Buenos Aires-pe** - The passage specifically names ""Argentina Teatro"", not ""Teatro La Plata"".



"
Mba'e otopa raka'e ACMA Big Brother rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Nombohovakéi léi ñemokirirĩ rehegua** (It does not violate the privacy law).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Big Brother nombohovakéi léi ñemokirirĩ rehegua ha'éva ojehupíva online rehegua..."" which directly translates to ""Big Brother does not violate the privacy law that is implemented online...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi oñemomarãndúva oñeñongatu Big Brother web rendápe** (The documents are published on Big Brother's website) - The text says they *aren't* published on Big Brother's website.
* **C: Ombohovake léi ñemokirirĩ rehegua** (It violates the privacy law) - The text explicitly states the opposite.
* **D: Ojejuhu contenido oikoha teterehe peteĩ servidor-pe** (Content is found stored on a server) - This is a fact mentioned in the passage, but isn't what ACMA *does* regarding Big Brother.  It's a detail about how things work, not ACMA's stance.



"
Mba'éicha oĩva'erã ta'ãngamýi ha'e hag̃ua Internet-pe ojehupíva rehegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Oĩmanteva'erã teterehe peteĩ servidor-pe** (It exists as data on a server).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""ha'e hag̃ua Internet-pe ojehupíva, oĩmanteva'erã teterehe peteĩ servidor-pe"" (to exist online, it exists as data on a server).  This directly answers the question of how the information is held for online access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Osẽva'erã Internet-pe** (It comes out on the internet) - This is a general statement but doesn't explain *how* it exists online.
* **C: Ndaikatúi oñeñongatu web rendape** (It cannot be seen on a web page) - The passage states the opposite - things are *published* online, potentially avoiding Big Brother's web presence, but they *can* be seen.
* **D: Ojehechaporãva'erã ACMA guive** (It is shown by ACMA) - The passage doesn't mention ACMA (the Australian Communications and Media Authority) being involved in *holding* the information.



"
Máva ha'e tendota Partido Liberal Australia-pegua?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The text states that Peter Costello was supporting Prime Minister **John Howard** and the Liberal party's consideration of the nuclear energy industry. Therefore, John Howard is the leader of the Liberal party mentioned in the text."
Mba'ére Australia ndoguerekóima energía nuclear industria?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndaha'éiti viable economicamente** (It's not economically viable).

Here's why:

The text states that Peter Costello said nuclear energy *could* be viable, but Australia would need to see if it's commercially viable before recommending it. He specifically says, ""Oiko porã ramo comercialmente, ñande jaguerekomante vaerã"" (If it's commercially viable, we will recommend it).  This implies the main reason Australia doesn't have a nuclear industry *currently* is because it hasn't been proven to be economically feasible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Avave ndombojekói (People don't want it):** The text doesn't mention public opinion.
* **B: Omboporoikovaieterei (It's too expensive):** While related to economic viability, ""not viable"" is a broader concept than simply ""expensive"".
* **C: Ipeligrosoiterei (It's dangerous):**  The text doesn't mention safety concerns as a reason.



"
Máva esquiadorpa oha'ã peteĩ sambyhaha pytyvõme?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Esquiaador Polonia-gua kuimba’e ohecha’ỹva apytepegua Maciej Krezel ha **isambyhyha Anna Ogarzynska** omohu’ã paapyhápe Super-G-pe.""

This translates to: ""The visible Polish male skier Maciej Krezel and **his guide Anna Ogarzynska** finished fourth in Super-G.""

A guide is someone who assists a visually impaired skier, therefore Anna Ogarzynska is helping a skier. The other options are skiers competing independently.



"
Mávapa omohu'ã porundyhápe Super-G kuñanguéra apytépe?,"The correct answer is **B: Holanda**.

The text states: ""Ijapytepekuéra oĩ Holanda, Anna Jochensen reheve omohu’ã porundyhápe kuñanguéra apytépe Super-G-pe kuehe..."" which translates to ""Among them is Holland, Anna Jochensen achieving third place among the women in Super-G..."" 

Therefore, Holanda (Netherlands) is the country that achieved third place in Super-G for women."
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ha’e hína ñe'ẽrei ko'ã apytépe Blake rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Ojepykuaava’ekue upépe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pe presentador, **ojepykuáva vaekue upépe**, he'i ndoatakai hague..."" This translates to ""The presenter, **was accused in it**, said he didn't use drugs and said he used the stick...""

The question asks what the text says *about* Blake.  The passage directly states Blake was accused (ojepykuáva) in the court case.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He'i oataka haguére:** (He said to use) - The text doesn't say Blake said this. It's the presenter who denies using drugs.
* **C: Oipuru pe palo:** (He used the stick) - The text says *he* used the stick to protect the bottles, but doesn't directly link that action to Blake initially. It's stated he used it, but it's the presenter's statement.
* **D: Botella oñemombóva hese:** (Bottles were thrown) - This is a detail of the situation, but doesn't directly describe something *about* Blake.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba’e ñe’e Blake rehehua ha’e hína ñe'ẽrei ko'ã apytépe?","The correct answer is **D: ""Oje'e chupe """"""""casi inevitable"""""""" pe ijeho angairo pe""**

Here's why:

The question asks what is *said* about Blake in the text. Option D directly quotes the judge's statement to Blake – that his imprisonment was ""almost inevitable."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oho condenado oñeha'ã haguére ombyai hag̃ua tekojoja** (He was convicted for attempting to endanger lives) - This is *why* he was condemned, not something *said* to or about him.
* **B: Ojepykua** (He was presented) - This refers to the presenter in the case, not Blake.
* **C: Oñemombo hese palo** (He was protected by the pole) - This refers to Blake using the pole to protect bottles, not something said about him.



"
Mba'erãpa ndojeiporumõ'ái Tetãnguéra Ojoajúva viru ñongatupy?,"The correct answer is **C: Óga yjapyhy'ỹva**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pe viru ikatu ojeipuru ojejapo hag̃ua **óga yjapyhy'ỹva**, y ojeipuru porãve hag̃ua ha ñemitỹ ojuavyvarã.""  This directly translates to ""The fund can be used to build **sturdy houses**, and to improve and strengthen infrastructure.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemitỹ juavyvarã:** (Strengthen infrastructure) - While the fund *helps* with this, it's not *what* it's directly used *for* initially. It's a result of using the fund.
* **B: Mba'aporekokuaa oñeipytyvõ hag̃ua tetã okakuaa'ívape okakuaa hag̃ua:** (Knowledge to help the country understand) - This refers to the initial purpose of the fund (research), not how it's *used*.
* **D: Oñembosa'ive hag̃ua arapytu ñembyaku efecto:** (To lessen the effect of the approaching storm) - This describes the *overall goal* of using the fund, but not the specific application.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e hi'ãnte Tetãnguéra Ojoajúvape oipysyrõ?","The correct answer is **A: Viru, oñemboja'ota rupi mba'aporekokuaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hi'ãnte avei Tetãnguéra Ojoajúvape omoñepyrũ peteĩ viru ñongatupy oipytyvõ hag̃ua tetãme...""  This directly translates to ""Also, the Allied Nations begin a project to help the country..."" and that project *is* the ""viru"" (fund/resource).  It's being used to support knowledge development (""mba'aporekokuaa"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemitỹ:** While *ñemitỹ* (strength) is mentioned as something the fund can improve, it's not what the Allied Nations are *initiating*.
* **C: Ka'aguy oĩva gueteri:**  This refers to existing forests and isn't what the nations are doing.
* **D: Y ojeipuru porãve hag̃ua:** This describes *how* the fund can be used (to improve and beautify) but isn't the fund itself or what the nations are starting.



"
"Ko'ã apytépe, mba'épa Albert Muchanga nde'íri mba'e ne'irãva gueteri oñemoñeï?","The correct answer is **B: Araka'épa ikatu ñemba'apo oñepyrũ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Comisionado he'i kuri: """"Ne´irã romoneĩ mba'éichatapa ñepyrũgua ha arancel oñeme'ẽtava mbojojaha, katu marco oĩmbáma romba'apo ñepyrũ haguã 1 jasypokõi 2020-pe."""" This translates to: ""The Commissioner said: """"We are still discussing how the launch and tariff concessions will be made, but the framework is in place to begin on July 1, 2020.""""

This clearly indicates Albert Muchanga was discussing *when* implementation could begin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Benin-pa oiketa AfCFTA-pe** - The text states Benin is hosting, not that it's *about* Benin's participation.
*   **C: Mba'éichapa ñepyrũgua** - He's *discussing* how it will launch, not stating what it is.
*   **D: Ñeme'ẽtava mbojojaha** -  Again, he's discussing the concessions, not simply stating they exist.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'érepa ikatu mba'apo oñepyrũ jasypokõipe?","The correct answer is **B: Marco ha concesión-kuéra oĩmbáma rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Ne´irã romoneĩ mba'éichatapa ñepyrũgua ha arancel oñeme'ẽtava mbojojaha, *katu marco oĩmbáma romba'apo ñepyrũ haguã 1 jasypokõi 2020-pe.*"""" 

This translates to: ""We don't yet know how the initial tariff reductions and concessions will be, *but the framework is already in place to begin on July 1st, 2020.*""

The text specifically says the *framework* (marco) and *concessions* (concesión-kuéra) being in place allow work to begin on July 1st. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Nigeria's readiness is mentioned, but not as the *reason* work can begin.
* **C:** The Commissioner's permission is not the core reason for starting.
* **D:** While the tariff reductions are *part* of the process, the text states we don't *know* the details yet, only that the framework exists to *allow* the process to start.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa The Atlanta Journal-Constitution oacusa tekombo’e mba’apohára rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Ojuhuha apañuãi hyepýpe, katu ndoku’éi umi ojuhúva rovake.**

The text states: ""Marandu ohechauka kytakuéra ojehupytýva kuaara’ãme ojupiveha pya’eve oñeimo’ã’ỹháicha ha he’i mbo’ehao ojuhuha apañuãi hyepýpe, katu ndoku’éi umi ojuhúva rovake.""  This directly translates to ""The report showed that test scores were manipulated, and it said the cheating happened at the school level, but not all scores were changed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñemoambuepahague Journal-Constitution marandu** - This says the report was changed, but doesn't state what the *accusation* is.
* **B: Ndohekomba’e payhúi tavapýpe g̃uarã** - This refers to his overall job, not the specific accusation by the newspaper.
* **D: Omoarandu rupi kytakuéra ojehupytýva kuaara’ãme oguejyveha** -  This describes *what* the report shows, but not the *accusation* itself.



"
"Oñemopyendáva marandu ko maranduhaipe, mba'e noñemombe'úi Atlanta Journal-Constitution marandupe?","The correct answer is **A: Kytakuéra ojehupytýva kuaara’ãme ojupiveha** (The students who benefited from the cheating).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Marandu ohechauka kytakuéra ojehupytýva kuaara’ãme ojupiveha pya’eve oñeimo’ã’ỹháicha ha he’i mbo’ehao ojuhuha apañuãi hyepýpe, katu ndoku’éi umi ojuhúva rovake.""  This directly translates to: ""The article shows how students benefited from cheating and says the school scores improved, but not the students who were actually cheating."" 

The question asks what the *Atlanta Journal-Constitution* article focused on. The article's focus was on *who* benefited from the cheating, even if it wasn't the students actually involved in the cheating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Documento ojeiporúva kuaara’ãrã oñemoambuepahague** (Documents proving changes to the test results) - While documents *were* found, the article initially focused on the beneficiaries, not the documentation itself.
* **C: Ganador Superintendente Nacional del Año 2013-pegua** (The 2013 National Superintendent of the Year winner) - The passage mentions the winner but doesn't say this was the focus of the article.
* **D: Hekomba’e payhu tavapýpe g̃uarã rehe** (About the test-taking in high schools) - This is a general topic, not the specific focus of the *Atlanta Journal-Constitution*’s reporting.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ojeikuaa oikorire bomba kapu?","The correct answer is **D: Mboy omanóvapa oĩ** (How many died).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is known about the bombing.** The text states ""Oĩ marandu teéva he’íva oĩha poapy omanóva"" which directly translates to ""There is evidence indicating how many died.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mboýpa opyta herido** (How many were injured) - While the text mentions injuries (30+), the question asks what is known *about the bombing itself*, not just the aftermath.
* **B: Mba'e edificio yképepa okapu bomba-kuéra** (Which building the bombs were in) - The text mentions a government building, but the question asks what is *known* about the bombing, and knowing the building isn't the primary piece of information given.
* **C: Okapuvépa ra'e ambue bomba-kuéra** (Are there more bombs?) - The text states another bomb was found, but the question isn't asking about future possibilities, it's asking about what is *currently known*.

Mboy partido-pa oha'ã Jesús oike rire Manchester City 2017-pe?,"The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""ha'ãhára Brasil-gua oha'ã kuri 53 partido club ndive opaite ñoa'ãngatúpe..."" which translates to ""The Brazilian forward played 53 games for the club in all competitions...""

Therefore, Gabriel Jesus played 53 matches for Manchester City after joining in 2017."
Mba'e club-pe pa Jesús oike £27 millones rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras-pe**.

The text states Jesús was sold *from* Palmeiras to Manchester City for £27 million. Therefore, he was at Palmeiras when the £27 million transfer happened.

* **The passage states:** ""Ope ógape oĩ heta peregrino oúva táva marangatúpe hajj peregrinación ára oguahẽtavo."" (In that building there are many pilgrims coming to the holy city for the hajj pilgrimage.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Huésped-kuéra oú La Meca-pe peregrinación árarã** - While they *are* in Mecca for a pilgrimage, the passage specifically mentions the *hajj* pilgrimage.
* **B: Petetãteã huésped-kuéra ndaha'éi ko táva-gua** - The passage explicitly states they *are* in this city (La Mecca).
* **D: Upe ñembohupaha huésped-kuéra hetave oĩ táva marãngatupeguáva** - While many are from the UAE, the passage doesn't state they *all* are from holy cities. It simply says a lot of them are from the UAE.

(This house has many pilgrims arriving for the hajj pilgrimage. Many of the host's guests are from the United Arab Emirates.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndoikói mba'e vai** (It doesn't say anything) - The text *does* say something.
* **C: Huésped oúva táva marangatúpe hajj peregrinación ára oguahẽtavo** (Guests arriving for the hajj pilgrimage) - While true, this is a general statement and doesn't specify *who* the guests are.
* **D: Huésped-kuéra hetave oĩ Meca retãygua** (Many of the guests are from Mecca) - The text explicitly states they are from the United Arab Emirates, not Mecca.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba’e marandu jechoka rehegua ndojeikuaaporãi?","The correct answer is **A: Jechoka tuichakue** (The size of the debris).

Here's why:

The text states the scientists believe the debris is *very large* and are trying to determine *how large* it is and what effects it could have on the planet. This directly relates to the size/tuichakue of the debris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moõpa oĩ pe jechoka** (Where is the debris) - The text states it's 491 miles above the Earth, so the location *is* known.
* **C: Mba'e efectopa ikatu jechoka oguereko ñande planetare** (What effects the debris could have on our planet) - While the text *mentions* they're studying the effects, the main focus of their inquiry, as stated, is the size.
* **D: Moõpa oĩ desecho-kuéra** (Where are the debris) - Similar to B, the text provides information about the debris' location.

Ha'ekuera oñehaʼã gueteri oikuaa **mba'eichaitepa tuicha** pe jechoka"").  The whole point of the analysis is to understand the size of the debris and its potential impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mávapa o-seguíta desecho-kuéra** (Who is tracking the debris) - While mentioned, this isn't the *primary* thing they're trying to find out.  They already *know* who is tracking it.
* **B: Mba'eichaitépa ipya'e ojere hína ra'e satélite-kuéra jechoka jave** (How the debris was released by the satellites) - The text doesn't focus on *how* it was released, but on what it *is*.
* **C: Mba'éichapa pe resultado de análisis oñeguenohẽta** (How the results of the analysis are made public) - This is about *where* the information is going, not *what* the information *is*.

The text states: ""Batten ohupytýkuri 190° upe ary 2008 terarysýi **400** Americano Ipirapire hetavéva apytégui $2,3 su sua rupi.""  This directly translates to ""Batten occupied 190° in the year 2008, with 400 Americano Ipirapire in its vicinity for $2.3 per square foot.""

The question asks how many positions Batten held in the Americano Ipirapire vicinity. The text clearly states **400**.



"
Mávape Batten ome'ẽva’ekue peteĩ me'ẽrei?,"The correct answer is **A: Terarysýi Americano Ipirapire hetavéva**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batten ohupytýkuri 190° upe ary 2008 terarysýi 400 Americano Ipirapire hetavéva apytégui...""  This translates to ""Batten occupied 190° in the year 2008 with the 400th anniversary of Americano Ipirapire...""  The passage then says he *gave* something related to this anniversary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbo'ehaovusu Virginia-pegua:** While he attended the University of Virginia, the passage doesn't say he *gave* something *to* the university.
* **C: Heta mbo'ehaópe:** The passage doesn't mention giving to many schools.
* **D: Facultad de Artes ha Ciencias-kuérape:** He attended the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, but the passage specifically links the gift to the Americano Ipirapire anniversary.

Mba'epa ndaipóri pe léi oguenohẽva'ekue Motenondehára Arnold Schwarzenegger pa'ũme?,"The correct answer is **A: Ombotovéva ta'ãngamýi ñembosaraiha orekóva violencia umi tapicha menor-va California-pe** (It prohibits violent depictions in media for minors in California).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Léi apopyrã ojerure umi ta'ãngamýi ñembosaraiha orekóva violencia toguereko peteĩ calcomanía """"18"""" he'íva hese ha omohenda ojehepyme'ẽramo peteĩ menor-pe..."" (The law aims to regulate depictions of violence in media, requiring an ""18"" sticker and penalizing showing it to a minor...).  This directly answers the question of what the law does.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Multa upe ofensa rehe** (Fine for the offense) - This is a *result* of the law, not what the law *is*.
* **C: Ombotovéva ta'ãngamýi ñembosaraiha orekóva violencia umi tapicha menor-vape California okára** (Prohibits violent depictions for minors in California's state) - While it applies to California, the passage doesn't specifically say it's a *state* law, just a law in California.  Option A is more precise.
* **D: Toguereko peteĩ calcomanía ñembosaraihape orekóva violencia** (Requires a sticker on violent depictions) - This is a *part* of how the law works, but doesn't encompass the entire purpose of the law.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa nohendúi oje'eva'ekue?","The correct answer is **B: Mike**.

Here's why:

The passage states Miller said, """"Mike heta oñe'ẽ kuri upe audienciape, che añembo sako'i hina kuri ha upevare nahendúi kuri ha'e he'i vaekue hina"""" which translates to ""Mike talks a lot to the audience, I feel small around him and that's why I don't hear him saying what he means.""  

Miller specifically says he doesn't *hear* what Mike is saying. Therefore, the answer is Mike.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui ha’e añetegua Miller ohasava’ekuére audiencia-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Nohendúi kuri ha'e he'iva’ekue oñembosako'i hína rupi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Miller he'i kuri """"Mike heta oñe'ẽ kuri upe audienciape, che añembo sako'i hina kuri ha upevare nahendúi kuri ha'e he'i vaekue hina"""".""  This translates to: ""Miller said, 'Mike talks a lot to the audience, I feel small because of it and that's why I don't hear him saying what he thinks.'""
* **Option B** directly reflects Miller's feeling of *not hearing* what Mike is saying because Mike talks so much to the audience, making Miller feel diminished.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dave oheja peteĩ jehecha tuicha Miller-pe:** The passage mentions Dave initiating the comment, not that Dave interrupted Miller.
* **C: Duvall mitãnguéra oñe'ẽterei audiencia jave:** The passage doesn't say Duvall's children speak *to* the audience. It just mentions Duvall considers having his children speak.
* **D: Ohendu porã hína kuri mba’épa Duvall omombe'úva’ekue:** The passage focuses on Miller's perspective, not what Duvall thinks.



"
"""Mávapa he'iva’ekue ojehecha jey hag̃ua pe """"Lei Pytu Potĩ""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Stephen Harper**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mburuvicha Stephen Harper omoñeĩ kuri omondo hag̃ua tetã rekuái 'Lei Pytu Potĩ' upe comite opavave partido kuera pegua ojehecha jey hag̃ua...""  This directly translates to ""Prime Minister Stephen Harper is introducing to pass the federal 'Big Land Law' the committee of all their party members to review...""  Therefore, Stephen Harper is the one initiating the review of the ""Lei Pytu Potĩ"".



"
Mávapa ombotove 'Lei Pytu Potĩ' ha'ehagui peteĩ ñemaniobra ñepyrũra upe elección ojejapotava rupi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tetã rekuái** (Federal Government).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Upe Tetã rekuái Federal oike guive ocontrola haguã pirapire ñemoĩ Tasyo Mersey Devonport pegua, Tasmania, upe tetã rekuái ha ambue mburuvicha federal kuera okaguai kuri ko leire ha'eha peteĩ ñemaniobra ñepyrũra upe eleccion federalpe ojejapotava hina Jasypateĩme.""

This translates to: ""The Federal Government went to control the issue of the Mersey Devonport dam in Tasmania, the government and other federal leaders believed this law was a maneuver to prepare for the federal election to be held in June.""

Therefore, the *Tetã rekuái* (Federal Government) is identified as the entity using the law as a political maneuver.



"
Mba'e ojapo compuesto-kuéra ácido cianúrico ha melanina-gua ojoaju rire mbarakaja týpe?,"The correct answer is **C: Cristal-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mokõive compuesto ojoaju ojapo haguã **cristal** ohapembotykuaáva riñón rembiapo..."" which translates to ""The two compounds combine to form **crystals** that obstruct kidney function...""

Therefore, the compounds (acid cianúrico and melanina) form crystals when they combine in the urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Riñón (Kidney):** While the crystals *affect* the kidneys, they aren't what's *made*.
*   **B: Mymba rembi'u (Small animals):**  The text mentions small animals in relation to *finding* these compounds, not what they create.
*   **D: Espectroscopía infrarroja (Infrared spectroscopy):** This is a *method used to analyze* the crystals, not what the compounds create.



"
Mba'érepa ohechava’ekue umi Mba'ekuaaharakuéra upe espectroscopía infrarroja?,"The correct answer is **C: Mymbakuéra hasyva'ekue**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko'ã cristal composición oho umi ojejuhu va'ekue mymbakuéra hasy va'ekue týpe oñembohovakéramo espectroscopía infrarroja rupive (FTIR)."" 

This translates to: ""The composition of these crystals is shown in the urine of animals that have kidney problems, using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Therefore, the spectroscopy is used to analyze the *urine of animals with kidney problems* to understand the crystal composition.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Riñón rembiapo (Kidney function):** While the crystals *relate* to kidney function, the spectroscopy isn't used to directly measure kidney function, but to analyze what's *in* the urine because of kidney issues.
*   **B: Cristal oikóva mbarakaja týpe (Crystals in the urine):** The spectroscopy is used to *analyze the composition* of the crystals, not just to see that they are present.
*   **D: Mymba rembi'u ivaíva (Various animal food):** The food isn't directly analyzed using spectroscopy in this context.



"
"""Mávapa he'i Luna-re """"Mburuvicha tenonde Apýrape""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dramer he'i: """"Luna hína mburuvicha tenonde apýrape."""" (Tommy Dreamer said: """"Luna is a strong man in the ring."""").

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna ""Mburuvicha tenonde Apýrape"".



"
"""Máva he'i Luna-re """"iñambue"""" ha?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels he'i kuri """" Luna iñambue va'ekue chéicha ikatu cherasa hína ahayhu ha ahechaga'úta chupe...hi'ã oĩ peteĩ tenda iporãvévape."""" which translates to ""Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said that Luna reminded him of his father and he wanted to look up to him...as if there was a good example to follow.""  He is the one who used the word ""iñambue"" (reminded).



"
Mba'épa ndojehúi upe mba'yrumýi mboguatahárape oĩva'ekue accidente-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Iñakã jeka vai**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Katu, mba'yrumýi mboguatahárape iñakã jeka vai."" which translates to ""However, the driver in the other vehicle was seriously injured.""  This directly answers the question of what wasn't known about the other driver's condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndojapói mba'eve tapicha óga ryepýpe oĩvare** - This refers to the people *in the house*, not the other driver.
* **C: Oñembohasa chupe hospital Cambridge-pegui ambue oĩva Great Yarmouth-pe** - This describes where the driver was *transferred*, not their initial condition.
* **D: Emergencia kuave'ẽmby pytyvõhára oguenohẽ mboguatahárape pe mba'ygúgui** - This describes *how* the driver was helped, not their condition.



"
Mba'épa ndaha'éi kuri peteĩ mba’e oñembotuicháva Sudáfrica ñembosarái rehe upe torneo rugby-gua aja?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndaha'éi herrumbroso upe juego**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jehecharamo jepe herrumbroso pe juego pe heindy yvy gotyo va kuéra ndive..."" which translates to ""Although the game might be rusty because of the long journey..."".  This directly indicates that *rustiness* (being ""herrumbroso"") is **not** a factor hindering South Africa's performance - they are playing despite it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemba'apo porã angirũ kuéra ndive:** The text says their good teamwork *helps* them, it doesn't hinder them.
* **B: Oguerekokuaa pe vakapipopo:** Having knowledge of the rules (*vakapipopo*) is a strength, not a weakness.
* **D: Pe idefensa disciplinada:** Their disciplined defense is a strength, not a hindrance.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka'e oñepyrũ Sudáfrica oĩ porãve?","The correct answer is **A: Pe 10:00 rupi** (At 10:00).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe juego oñepyrũ kuri 10:00 pyhareve ara porãre..."" which translates to ""The game starts at 10:00 on a beautiful day...""  This directly answers the question of when South Africa is doing well (starting the game).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe idefensa odisciplina rire** (After the defense is disciplined) - While the text mentions a disciplined defense as a strength, it doesn't say *when* South Africa is doing well *because* of it.
* **C: Opyta rire ohóvo hikuái Zambia kupépe** (After passing Zambia in position) - They *already* beat Zambia 26-0, it's not a future event tied to their success.
* **D: Ohasavo ohovo pe torneo** (Being able to advance in the tournament) - This is a potential outcome, not when they are currently doing well.

The text states: ""China PIB ikatu hína tuichave Estados Unidos mba'évagui **mokõi década-pe**."" (China's GDP could surpass that of the United States **in two decades**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemureko oñemoambueve rire** (After the market reforms) - While the reforms *led* to the potential for surpassing the US, it doesn't specify *when* that would happen.
* **C: Tetã oĩvove ambue poguýpe** (If the country had a different leader) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Mbohapy década-pe** (In three decades) - The text specifically states *two* decades.

Mba'e omokyre'ỹ Hu umi tetã kuera ojapo hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojapyhy hag̃ua jejapova ohasava idesarrollo-kuérape** (To help them catch up to development).

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Ha'e omokyre'ỹ umi tetã kuera subdesarrolladope """"ojei haguã upe tape tujagui omongy'araẽvo ha uperire omopotĩ haguã"""". Ha'e he'i avei """"ha'ekuera, uvei,  ndojejopyi vaerã ojapyhy haguã pota'ỹme jejapova ohasava idesarrollo kuerape, arigua ha ikatupyry kuera"""".""

This translates to: ""He encourages developing countries to 'walk the path of learning and then surpassing'. He also says 'it is necessary, indeed, to not hesitate to help them catch up to development, quickly and efficiently.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojesareko economia rembiapo rapyta rehe** (To understand the dynamics of the Chinese economy) - While Hu mentions China's economy, this isn't what he's *encouraging* other countries to do.
* **C: Ohasa hag̃ua hikuái arigua-kuéra** (To overcome poverty) -  Overcoming poverty is a *result* of development, not the direct encouragement.
* **D: Ojei hag̃ua upe tape tujagui omongy'araẽvo** (To walk the path of learning) - This is *part* of the encouragement, but not the complete goal – the goal is to surpass and develop.



"
Mba'e nomoĩri Hu?,"The correct answer is **D: Papaha upe emisión dioxido carbono-gua ñemboguejype**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ha'e nomoĩri papaha upe ñemboguejype..."" which translates to ""He doesn't support the efforts..."" and then specifically refers to the efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rembiapo rapyta rupive:** While Hu mentions China's economic development, this isn't *what* he doesn't support, but *how* he explains his position.
*   **B: Oñe'ẽ upe tape omongy'araẽvo rehe:** This refers to a suggestion he makes *to* developing countries, not something he opposes.
*   **C: Araka'epa oñemboguejyta upe emisión dioxido carbono rehegua:** He doesn't oppose the *goal* of reducing emissions, but the *efforts* to achieve it as currently planned.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe rehe he'i Veerman ivaiha?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Richard Veerman, he'i: """"Angola oho teñói ivaivéva gotyo ha ivaieterei gueteri oikóva Angola-pe"""".""  This directly translates to ""Richard Veerman says: 'Angola is going to have a beautiful future and its people will live well in Angola.'""  

Therefore, Veerman is talking about the future of **Angola**.



"
"Juicio rupi, mávapa ombohekoviáta Huhne-pe Gabinete-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne ohejarei kuri ha oñembohekoviáta Gabinete-pe Diputado Ed Davey rehe.""  This translates to ""Huhne is accused of leaking to Cabinet Minister Ed Davey.""

Therefore, Huhne is accused of leaking information *to* Davey.



"
Máva oñemohendáta Ñemureko motenondeháraramo Juicio rupi?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oñeha'ãrõ avei diputado Norman Lamb toñemohenda Ñemureko motenondeháraramo tenda Davey ohejávape."" This translates to ""Deputy Norman Lamb is also trying to support the request for a review of what Davey could say.""  Therefore, Lamb is the one attempting to support the review request.



"
Mba'épa omongyre'ỹ umi artista ohechávape ojapo hag̃ua Camille Saint-Saens ópera jave?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojoaju hag̃ua hesekuéra ha opita cannabis**.

Here's why:

The text (P) specifically states that the artists smoke cannabis *before* going on stage to try and see things (hallucinations) related to the opera's themes of drugs and Japan.  This is directly linked to enhancing their performance/experience *during* the opera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oho hag̃ua Japón-pe** - While Japan is a theme of the opera, the text doesn't say the artists go *to* Japan.
* **C: Ojupi hag̃ua hikuái escenario-pe** - They are *already* on stage, the cannabis use is *before* they perform.
* **D: Hekovekuéra ombohape hag̃ua jehayhugui** - The text mentions the opera's theme *includes* drug use, but doesn't say the artists are using drugs to help them cope.



"
Mávapa añetehápe opita cannabis ópera jave?,"The correct answer is **C: Umi artista-kuéra** (The artists).

Here's why:

The text specifically states ""umi artista opita porro de cannabis escenario-pe"" - meaning ""the artists smoke cannabis on stage"".  The question asks *who* smokes cannabis in the opera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe artista** (The artist) - While true artists smoke it, the text refers to *multiple* artists.
* **B: Umi ohecháva** (The audience) - The text says the audience *watches* them, they don't smoke it themselves.
* **D: Camille Saint-Saens** (Camille Saint-Saens) - He's the composer, not someone mentioned as smoking cannabis.



"
Mba’éichapa avei ojehero “espacio rehe jeguata” ojapóva’ekue Leonov?,"The correct answer is **C: Tembiapo extravehicular tripulada**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...oñemotenonde kuri tembiapo extraveicular tripulada (EVA), térã """"espacio rehe jeguata""""..."" which directly translates to ""...he was awarded for his extravehicular activity (EVA), or """"space walk""""...""

Therefore, ""espacio rehe jeguata"" (space walk) is defined as ""tembiapo extravehicular tripulada"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apolo-Soyuz rembiapópe** - This refers to a later joint mission Leonov participated in, not what ""space walk"" is.
*   **B: Carrera espacial** - This is the ""space race"" itself, not the activity.
*   **D: Cosmonauta No. 11** - This is just a designation, not an explanation of the term.



"
Leonov omoakã kuri sovietico-kuéra mba'e rembiapópe?,"The correct answer is **B: Apolo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Pa ary rire, omoakã kuri sovietico-kuéra vore Apolo-Soyuz rembiapópe oikuaaukáva carrera espacial opámaha.""  This translates to: ""Later, he participated with the Soviets in the Apolo-Soyuz project, marking the end of the space race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe carrera espacial (The space race):** He *marked the end* of the space race, he didn't participate *in* it as described in the sentence.
* **C: Cosmonauta No. 11 (Cosmonaut No. 11):** This is his nickname, not a project he participated in later.
* **D: EVA (spacewalk):**  This was an early achievement, not the project he participated in later with the Americans.



"
Mávapa oñehunga mba'e'andýime?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oiko rire mba'e'aindýi, **Gibson** ojegueraha tasyópe, ha katu omano uperiremínte."" (After the incident, **Gibson** was hospitalized, and almost died.) This clearly indicates Gibson is the one who experienced the incident and therefore, the one who ""suffered the incident"" (oñehunga mba'e'andýime).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peteĩ tapicha omba'apova'ekue peteĩ mba'yrumyikotýpe:** This person *witnessed* the incident, they didn't *suffer* it.
* **C: Mitãnguéra:** The children are described as *being* in the incident (""oĩkuri mitã oha'arõva ohasa hag̃ua tape...""), but they aren't identified as the ones who initially suffered it.
* **D: Omoakãva mba'yrumýi:** This refers to the ""lucky one"" (64 years old) who didn't suffer the incident.



"
Mba'épa ojehu umi tapicha oĩva'ekue mba'e'andýime?,"The correct answer is **C: Osapukái ha hasẽ joa hikuái**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Oĩkuri mitã oha'arõva ohasa hag̃ua tape ha opavave osapukái ha hasẽ"""". This translates to ""There is a child trying to cross the road and everyone swerved and left.""  This means people avoided hitting the child by swerving and driving away.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mokõivéva omano** (Two people died) - The text doesn't mention anyone dying.
*   **B: Peteĩ noñehungái, peteĩ omano** (One didn't get hurt, one died) - Again, no deaths are mentioned.
*   **D: Mokõivéva oñehunga** (Two people were unharmed) - While people avoided hitting the child, the text doesn't specifically say they were unharmed, only that they swerved and left.



"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umi científico kuera omohu'ã kuri upe pokopýva hũva oafecta umi ambue pokopýva hũvape..."" which translates to ""The scientists are trying to see how the collapse affects *other* collapses.""

The question asks what the scientists are trying to observe the effects *on*. The passage directly states they're studying the effect on ""ambue pokopýva"" (other collapses).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Marejada rupive (in a wavy manner):** While the text mentions being ""marejada rupive,"" this describes *how* the constellation moves, not what the scientists are observing the effect *on*.
* **C: Ku'i kueragui (from small groups):** The text mentions formations from many small groups, but this isn’t what the scientists are focused on studying the *effect* on.
* **D: Jepokopýva hũva (the collapse itself):**  The scientists are studying the effect *of* the collapse, *on* something else – not the collapse itself.



"
Mba'éichagua jepokopyre omaña hína ra'e umi científico-kuéra?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagitario ha Kamby Rape rehe**.

Here's why:

The text states the scientists are studying how the collapsing of the Sagittarius constellation and the Kamby Rape (likely a local name for a celestial body or event) *affect* other collapses.  The passage specifically mentions the influence these two have on other collapses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kamby Rape ha Jasyre:** While Jasyre (likely a local name for a constellation) is mentioned, the focus isn't on its impact, but on its similarity to Kamby Rape.
* **B: Yvy ha Sagitariore:** The Earth (Yvy) isn't the focus of the scientific study.
* **C: Yvy ha Jasyre:**  Same reasoning as B.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'érehe ndojapói ñe'ẽreity umi conservador-kuéra?","The correct answer is **A: Pira pire jeipurúre ojesocorre hag̃ua**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controversy stems from ""upe pira pire jeipurúre ojesocorre ha oñemopu'a jey hag̃ua Yvytupochy Katrina rire"" (the funds used to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina). The conservative tax is *called* ""Bush Ñemuha Nueva Orleans pegua"" (Bush's tax for New Orleans) *because* of this rebuilding fund controversy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sa'i ñeha'ã ñemopu'ajevy hag̃ua** (A big attempt to readjust) - This refers to the liberals' efforts, not the conservatives'.
* **C: Contrato kuera oñeme'ẽva rehe** (About the contracts given) - This is what the liberals are focusing *on*, not the reason the conservatives have a tax.
* **D: Pira pire jeipurúre ñemopu'ä jey hag̃ua** (To rebuild the funds) -  This is a consequence of the initial fund usage, not the *reason* for the conservative tax.



"
Máva oñe'ẽreity contrato-kuéra oñeme'ẽva rehe ñemopu'ã jevy hag̃ua Yvytupochy Katrina rire?,"The correct answer is **B: Liberal-kuéra**.

The passage states: ""Umi ñe'ẽreity Liberal kuera ojapova ñeha'ã ñemopu'ajevy haguã ojenfoca kuri umi contrato kuera oñeme'ẽva umi Washington peguape.""  This directly translates to ""The Liberal words made an attempt to refocus the contracts given to those in Washington.""

Therefore, the Liberal groups are the ones trying to reform the contracts.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, moõ guive Stardust ygarata rendy ojehechata?","The correct answer is **B: California yvate gotyo**.

Here's why:

This directly translates to ""It flies and the sun rises to the north of **California** and extends across California to Oregon, then Nevada and Idaho to Utah.""  This indicates the starting point of Stardust's visible path is north of California.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Idaho** - Idaho is *part* of the path, not where it begins.
*   **C: Nevada** - Nevada is also part of the path, not the starting point.
*   **D: Oregon mbyte** - Oregon is where the path *extends to*, not where it starts.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Stardust oñemohendáta record pyahúicha opa árape ha'ehaguére ygarata ipya'evéva og̃uahẽjevy hag̃ua Yvyýpe..."" which translates to ""Stardust holds the record for being the fastest object to ever return to Earth...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tuichavéva yvaga rendy** (The longest space journey) - The text doesn't focus on the length of the journey, but the speed.
*   **B: Ojehecha haguére hetave távape** (Being visible from many cities) - While the comet is visible, that's not the record being broken.
*   **D: Ohasáva San Francisco guive Los Ángeles peve pya'eve** (Traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles quickly) - This is just an example of the comet's speed, not the record itself.

Mba'épe ojoaju ra'e Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ha Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Isy**.

The text states: ""oñemoãngaipáta jejuka vaivére isy re'õngue ojetopa rire imba'yrumýime ararundýme"" which translates to ""after a long journey with his wife, following his retirement"".  It then introduces Saroja Balasubramanian as ""re'õngue"" (wife) of Dr. Malar Balasubramanian.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pehengue** (Friends) - The text doesn't describe them as friends.
* **B: Itajýra** (Colleagues) - The text doesn't mention their professional relationship.
* **D: Itia** (Children) - The text doesn't mention them having children.



"
Moõpa ojetopava’ekue Sara Balasubramanian re'õngue?,"The correct answer is **C: Mba'yrumýime** (in a car accident).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tahachi he'i oiméne te'õngue oĩhákuri upépe peteĩ ára pukukue."" which translates to ""She said her mother was found there a day earlier."" and earlier mentions Saroja Balasubramanian was found near her husband's wrecked car. This implies she was involved in the same accident/incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cincinnati-pe:** While Blue Ash (where Malar was found) is near Cincinnati, the question asks *where Saroja was found*, and the text doesn’t specifically state she was *in* Cincinnati.
*   **B: Tape ykére:** She was found *near* the road, but the question isn’t asking about her location relative to the road.
*   **D: Pittsburgh-pe:** The story begins with the initial search being in Pittsburgh, but Saroja was found in Ohio.



"
Mba'e ojogua eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...oipotave terakuã umi tenda Skype imbaretehápe..."" which translates to ""...can use the tendas (offers/deals) through Skype..."".  This directly links Skype to what is being offered on eBay.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Microsoft:** While Microsoft owns Skype, the passage specifically mentions *using* Skype, not Microsoft itself.
* **B: Apple:** Apple isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Zoom:** Zoom isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Mba'épa eBay oheka ohupyty pe jejogua rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Oreko peteĩ viru ome'ẽva** (They receive a commission).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ha'eháicha China, Europa kuarahy resẽ gotyogua ha Brasil"" (like China, Europe, and Brazil). This implies eBay is involved in transactions happening *in* these places, and therefore must receive something for facilitating those sales.  That something is a commission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Terakuã tenda pyahúpe** (They advertise the store) - The passage doesn't mention advertising.
* **C: Ojikuaaukave** (They investigate) - While eBay might investigate issues, this isn't the *immediate* consequence of a sale.
* **D: Ombovy'a accionista-kuérape** (They distribute to shareholders) - While profit distribution happens, it's not the direct action eBay takes after a sale.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ndoñe'ẽi umi ka'irãigua opytáva korapýpe ñorairõ rire?","The correct answer is **A: Omoñe'ẽva** (The speakers/those who communicate).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umi oñemoñe'ẽva oñeha'ã omyatyrõ hag̃ua pe oikóva, ha katu umi ka'irãigua oipotáva nahesakãporãi.""  This translates to ""Those who speak try to improve the situation, but the remaining animals are not well.""  This directly indicates that the *speakers* are the ones not communicating with the animals remaining in the corral.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tatarendy pysyrõhára (Corral guards):** The text says they *arrive* at 11:35, after the issue is already happening, they don't cause the silence.
* **C: Tahachi (Someone with equipment):**  They have equipment to help, but aren't the reason for the lack of communication.
* **D: Pohanohára (Doctors):** The text doesn't mention doctors.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui amo ipahápe ojapo umi preso ojere hag̃ua pe ñorairõgui?,"The correct answer is **D: Tatarendy**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umi tatarendy pysyrõhára ombogue tata 11:35 aravo pyharekuépe."" (The rescue workers will leave the area at 11:35 AM.) This implies the *tatarendy* (rescue workers) are the ones responsible for finishing up and leaving after the operation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ñe'ẽ hesakã rire:** (After speaking) - This doesn't relate to finishing the operation.
*   **B: Tĩmbo ombohesaýva:** (The smoke dissipates) - This is a condition, not who finishes the work.
*   **C: Ojejapíva:** (Those who work) - This is too general; it doesn't specify *who* finishes.



"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei resa rupi, mba'égui Irán isãsova'erã?","The correct answer is **B: Islámico ñepu'ã**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tendota rusu upe tetãgua, Ayatolá Ali Khamenei, he'i itakyráre ñesãingo ha'eha """"peteĩ ñuhã"""" oñepyrũ va'ekue Irángua Islámico ñepu'ã mboyve 1979-me ha pe tetã isãsoha va'erã upévagui.""  This translates to: ""The leader of that country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that the key is """"a miracle"""" that began with the Islamic Revolution before 1979 and the country has survived since then.""

Therefore, according to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's survival is due to the **Islamic Revolution**.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa omonéĩ umi tapykuere orekóva virupurukuaa iraní rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Irán-gua apohare oñemomba'eguasúva (Iranian oil companies)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""umívape oike viru jejoko ha Joaju Europa-gua ñembotove itakyra pýra ojeguerahauka hag̃ua, upévagui Irán-gua virupurukuaa og̃uenohẽ 80% iviru ambue tetãgua.""  This translates to: ""including oil companies and European Joint Venture to export oil, whereby Iranian oil exports represent 80% of the oil to other countries.""

Therefore, the text directly identifies Iranian oil companies as the primary entities involved in exporting oil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: OPEC:** While Iran is a member of OPEC, the text doesn't focus on OPEC's role.
*   **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He is the supreme leader and makes statements *about* the oil, but he isn't the one exporting it.
*   **D: Joaju Europa-gua (European Joint Venture):** They are mentioned as being *involved* in exporting, but they don't *own* the oil or represent the primary exporter.



"
Máva ko'ã pa'ũme ndaha'éi Francia-pe jeporavo reko?,"The correct answer is **A: Mba'yrurã'i hesakã** (Lack of transparency).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ary 1988 guive, mba'yrurã'i hesakãva'erã umi oiporavóva ha omañáva ikatu hag̃uáicha ohecha ndaiporiha hyrukuatia jeporavo oñepyrũvove ha noñemoingeiha hyrukuatia ndaha'éiva umi oiporavóva mba'e ojeipapáva ha oñemoneĩva hekópe.""  This translates to: ""Since 1988, transparency has been lacking in the elections and it has been possible to see the start of electoral fraud and the information wasn't what the voters were doing and receiving.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oha'ãva jeporavorã ikatu omondo tapicha hérape** (Efforts to improve voting can bring people's names) - This is mentioned, but it's a *solution* being proposed, not a characteristic of the *problem* with voting in France.
* **C: Oñemboheraguapy jeporavo rysýi** (Electoral data manipulation) - While manipulation is implied, the primary issue highlighted is the *lack of transparency* that *allows* manipulation.
* **D: Tapicha omondóva hérape umi oha'ãva oipapa voto-kuéra** (People bringing names to improve voting) - This is a specific action related to trying to *fix* the system, not the core issue.



"
Moõpa umi avakuéra oiporavo ha'ãhára?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuatia ojehechaukahápe ha'ãhára**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""oiporavóva oike ha'eño peteĩ koty'ípe, **omoinge kuatia ojehechaukahápe ha'ãhára** oiporavóva peteĩ hyrukuatiápe.""  This directly translates to: ""those who file live in a type of small building, **identified by a seal from the registry office**, filing in a sub-registry.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeporavo rysýi-pe:** While mentioned, it's a consequence *of* the filing, not *where* the filers are identified.
*   **C: Hyrukuatiápe:** This refers to the sub-registry *location*, not the identifying feature of the filers themselves.
*   **D: Peteĩ mba'ekape koty'ipe oĩva:** This is too general; it just says they live in a small building, not *how* they are identified.



"
Mba'épa omomýi Allen-pe oheka hag̃ua Musashi-pe poapy ary pukukue?,"The correct answer is **B: Ohecharamo rupi mapeo mar ruguáre**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ojejapo rire mapeo mar ruguáre, ojejuhupe naufragio ojeiporukuévo peteĩ ROV."" This translates to ""After making a detailed map of the sea, they used a shipwreck to deploy an ROV.""  This indicates Allen used the detailed map to locate the Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iviru tuicha rupi** (By large rivers) - The text doesn't mention rivers.
*   **C: Oiporu rupi tuichakue iviru ojeporeka hag̃ua mar rehe** (Using his knowledge to search the sea) - While Allen is knowledgeable, the text emphasizes the *map* as the key to finding the Musashi.
*   **D: Ohecharamo rupi ñorairõkuéra rembiasa** (Through the testimonies of war survivors) - While mentioned as a background, the text doesn't say this *helped Allen see* the Musashi.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épe oiporu Allen iviru tuichakue?","The correct answer is **A: Omoĩ porã jey hag̃ua Musashi** (To think well about Musashi).

Here's why:

The text states Allen ""oiporu tuichakue nunga iviru ojeporeka hag̃ua mar rehe ha oñepyrũ ojeporeka Musashi jejuhurã hekove pukukue ohecharamo rupi ñorairõkuéra rembiasa.""  This translates to ""uses his intellect to study the sea and begins to study Musashi, hoping to reveal its hidden form to the world of battles.""  The primary purpose of using his intellect is to *think well about* or understand Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojeporeka hag̃ua mar rehe** (To study the sea) - While he studies the sea, that's a means to an end (finding Musashi), not the direct use of his intellect.
* **C: Ojapo hag̃ua peteĩ ROV** (To build a ROV) - He *uses* a ROV, he doesn't use his intellect to *build* it (the text says it was recovered from a shipwreck).
* **D: Oñeamoarandu hag̃ua mapeo mar ruguáreheve** (To improve sea mapping) - While mapping is involved, it's not the *primary* way he's using his intellect.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, máva rupi oiko mba'e vai mba'ejapoha jerére?","The correct answer is **A: Uranio okaireíva**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tendotakuéra oimo'ã kóva he'ise umi mba'yru oguerekóva uranio okaireíva upe tendápe ikatúraka'e ojeka ha oñehẽ."" This translates to ""Experts suggest that the substances containing leaked uranium in the accident can be collected and released are the cause of the contamination.""

Therefore, the leaked uranium is identified as the source of the contamination (the 'mba'e vai mba'ejapoha jerére' - the thing causing the contamination).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Cesio iradimbaretekuéva:** Cesio is *a result* of the accident/contamination, not the initial cause.
*   **C: Tatatĩ morotĩ:** This refers to the initial event (the nuclear accident) itself, not the substance causing the contamination.
*   **D: Yodo:** Similar to Cesio, yodo is a radioactive substance *released* by the accident, not the primary contaminant source.

Mávapa ko'ãva pa'ũme ndoje'ekái umi yvypora oikóva mba'ejapoha ykére?,"The correct answer is **B: Opyta hag̃ua hogapýpe** (To stay in their homes).

Here's why:

The passage states the experts told people living near the accident to *stay in their homes* (""opyta hag̃ua hogapýpe"") to avoid exposure and prevent consuming contaminated food and water.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ombogue hag̃ua pytu ñemohendapy** (To lower body temperature) - This is not mentioned as a reason to stay indoors.
* **C: Ani opytũ tatatĩ morotĩ** (Not to see the red sky) - This isn't a reason given for the instructions.
* **D: Ani hag̃ua hoy'u y me'ẽhágui** (To avoid eating and drinking) - While avoiding contaminated food and water is *a result* of the instructions, it's not the *reason* people were told to stay home. Staying home was to *prevent* needing to avoid contaminated supplies.



"
"Dr. Moll rupive, mba'épa ombopy'apyve chupe XDR-TB rehe?","The correct answer is **B: Variante imbareteterei pohã rovake**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peteĩ ñe'ẽjovakéme, ha'e he'íkuri ko variante pyahu """"ombopy'apy ha omoãngataiterei ojukahaguére hetaiterei tapichápe"""".""  This translates to ""In a statement, he describes this variant as 'highly contagious and potentially affecting many people'.""  Dr. Moll is worried about the *contagious variant* of XDR-TB.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikatuha ojeipyhýi pe vícho tasyópe** (It could be transmitted through coughing) - While the text mentions coughing as a way to spread it (option C), this isn't what *worries* Dr. Moll specifically.
* **C: Mboy tapichápepa ikatu peteĩ hasýva ombohasy** (Perhaps one infected person can infect many people) -  This is a *result* of the variant's contagiousness, not the variant itself that concerns him.
* **D: Ojukakuaa hetaiterei tapichápe** (Affecting many people) - Again, this is a consequence, not the specific concern about the variant's properties.



"
Mboy hasýva oje'e ha'eha tasyo mba'apohára?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peteĩ ñe'ẽjovakéme, ha'e he'íkuri ko variante pyahu """"ombopy'apy ha omoãngataiterei ojukahaguére hetaiterei tapichápe"""". Pohãnohára Moll oimo'ã umi hasýva ikatuha oipyhýkuri pe vícho tasyópe ha **mokõi umíva apytépe ha'e tasyo mba'apohára**."" 

This translates to: ""In a statement, he warns that this variant is highly contagious and has the potential to infect many people. Dr. Moll estimates that each infected person can infect the virus to up to **two health workers**.""



"
Mba'éichagua tembiporupa oiporu pe NextGen sistema?,"The correct answer is **A: Oñemopyendáva satélite-pe** (It is based on satellites).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Oipuru tembiporu pyahu oñemopyendáva satélite-pe..."" (It uses technology based on satellites...). This directly answers the question of how the NextGen system uses technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jehecha pya’eve** (Sees better) - While the system *results* in better visibility, it doesn't *use* better visibility as its technology.
* **C: Tempiporu oiporúva yvypegua radar** (Time using conventional radar) - The system *improves* on traditional radar, it doesn't just use it.
* **D: Tembiporu oiporúva carbono jepoi** (Technology using carbon emissions) - This is inaccurate; the system *reduces* carbon emissions, it doesn't use them.



"

Here's why:

The text specifically states that NextGen uses technology to allow air traffic controllers to ""ohecha pya’eve"" (see more clearly) the traffic and ""ome’ẽvo marandu porãve piloto-kuérape"" (provide better information to pilots). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tape mbykyvéva jeveve** (Faster travel) - While NextGen *aims* to improve travel, the text doesn't directly state it achieves this. It focuses on the *how* (better technology) not the direct *result* (faster travel).
*   **C: Sa’ivéta carbono jepoi** (Reduce carbon emissions) - The text mentions this as a *benefit* of NextGen, but it's not the primary way it helps air traffic.
*   **D: Sa'ive combustible** (Save fuel) - Similar to C, this is a benefit, but not the direct function for air traffic controllers.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...marandekohaiha kuera okaguai kuri FBI politica tujare ocentra haguere irecurso kuera umi caso ndahaýiva ojemuesakã..."" This directly translates to ""their complaints are based on FBI policy to center their resources on cases that aren't being investigated.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ombotuicha haguä rembiapo porã papaha** (To improve their good work) - This is mentioned as a *result* of the policy, not the reason for the complaints.
*   **C: Ojecentraiterei umi tie'ỹreheguare** (They are concentrating on the initiatives) - The passage mentions initiatives, but doesn't state this is the reason for the complaints.
*   **D: Mba'yru ñemondarehegua caso** (Cases of unknown origin) - This describes the *type* of case, not why the complaints exist.



"
Mba'e iniciativa tie'ỹrehegua ojapoka FBI-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ocentrave hag̃ua recurso mba'yru ñemonda rehe** (To centralize resources regarding serious crimes).

Here's why:

The text states the initiative aimed to ""centra... irecurso kuera umi caso ndahaýiva ojemuesakã"" (centralize resources for cases that aren't being resolved) and that it was about ""mba'yru ñemonda"" (serious crimes).  This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ombotuicha rembiapo porã papaha** (Improve good work performance) - While the initiative likely *hoped* to improve performance, the text doesn't state this as the primary goal.
* **C: Ojecentra hag̃ua umi caso ndahaýiva ojemuesakã** (To centralize unresolved cases) - This is *part* of the initiative, but not the overarching *reason* for it - the reason is to address serious crimes.
* **D: Tahachi oñeme'ẽva caso tie'ỹ rehe** (Amount of cases given regarding ties) - The ""10 tahachi"" refers to the amount of information the FBI was required to provide to Congress, not the initiative's focus.



"
Mba'épa ojehu pe mba'yru rendy ombohováiva'ekue pe JAS 39C Gripen-pe? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ojetopeta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe JAS 39C Gripen **ojetopeta** kuri upe avion pistape..."" which translates to ""The JAS 39C Gripen **took off** on the runway...""  The question asks what the reason for the alert is regarding the Gripen, and the text clearly states it *took off*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oñetumba** (It is being moved) - While movement is implied with takeoff, the key action is the *takeoff* itself triggering the alert.
*   **C: Okapu** (It arrived) - The text says it *took off*, not arrived.
*   **D: Opyta combustible-ỹme** (It is being refueled) - There's no mention of refueling in the text.



"
Mávagui oñemboty aeropuerto ojetopeta rire JAS 39C Gripe?,"The correct answer is **A: Vuelo ñemuhã reguape**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ha oñemboty pe aeropuerto umi vuelo ñemuha reguape."" which translates to ""...and the airport is occupied by the next scheduled flights.""  This directly answers the question of *why* the airport is busy after the Gripen lands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mba'yru rendykuéra (Reports)** - The reports are *about* the situation, they don't *cause* the airport to be occupied.
* **C: Kuatia ñe'ẽ local (Local news)** -  Similar to B, the local news reports on the situation, it doesn't cause it.
* **D: Escuadron Mo'akãhakuéra (Mo'akãha Squadron)** -  The squadron is mentioned as who the pilot belongs to, but they don't explain why the airport is occupied.



"
Mávapepa Brzezinski oaconseha Iran Revolución jave?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states that Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor (NSA) to **Carter** from 1977 to 1981.  The Iranian Revolution happened in 1979 during Carter's administration, and Brzezinski, as NSA, would have been advising Carter during that time.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Kissinger:** Brzezinski *replaced* Kissinger as NSA.
*   **Kennedy & Johnson:** These administrations were in the past, before Brzezinski's role as NSA.



"
Mávapa ha’eva’ekue Consejero Seguridad Nacional 1977-peve?,"The correct answer is **A: Brzezinski**.

The text states: ""ha upei oservi Consejero Segurida Nacional pe (NSA) 1977 guive 1981 peve, Henry Kissinger rendaguepe."" This translates to ""and he served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.""  Therefore, Brzezinski was the National Security Advisor in 1977.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1995-pe ojeiporavo kuri chupe ha'ãhára ha'evéva Partizan-pe.""  This directly answers the question of what wasn't mentioned about Bobek's work with Partizan Belgrade.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Omoingue 468 gol ári oha'ã aja upépe** (He scored 468 goals while playing there) - The passage *does* mention his goal count.
* **B: Omoingue hetave gol mayma oha'ãvagui** (He scored more goals than any other player) - The passage doesn't compare his goal-scoring to others.
* **D: Oha'ã hetave partido mayma oha'ãvagui** (He played more games than any other player) - The passage doesn't compare his game count to others.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ojoaju hesekuéra 1945-pe ha oi upépe 1958 peve."" which translates to ""He joined them in 1945 and was there until 1958.""  This directly indicates when he began playing for Partizan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oha'ãva'ekue Zagreb-pe oike mboyve Partizan-pe** (He played in Zagreb before joining Partizan) - The text says he was *born* in Zagreb, but doesn't say he played there *before* Partizan.
* **C: Oha'ã Partizan-pe 1995-peve** (He played for Partizan after 1995) - The text says he was honored as a legend of Partizan in 1995, *after* his playing career.
* **D: Ojeikuaaite ojeiporavo rire chupe ha'ãhára ha'evéva Partizan-pe** (He was recognized after being named a Partizan legend) - This is about recognition *after* his career, not when he started playing.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épe Hesperonychus ojoavy Velociraptor-gui?","The correct answer is **B: Ipyapẽmbuku mokõiha ituichave** (Two small claws).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ipyapẽmbuku mokõiha tuichavéraka'e, upévare ojehero Hesperonychus, he'iséva """"pyapẽmbuku kuarahy reike gotyogua"""".""  This directly translates to ""It has two small claws, therefore it is called Hesperonychus, meaning """"small clawed foot.""""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokõi ikupy** (Two feet) - While it has feet, the distinguishing feature isn't *having* two feet, but the claws *on* those feet.
* **C: Hete iperõ** (Strong tail) - The text mentions it was mobile and had a tail, but doesn't highlight this as a difference from Velociraptor.
* **D: Huguy aku** (Sharp teeth) - The text mentions sharp teeth but doesn't state this differentiates it from Velociraptor.



"
Pe he’iséva “Hesperonychus” ou hína mba'e característica física rehegua especie-gui?,"The correct answer is **C: Kupygui**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...upévare ojehero Hesperonychus, he'iséva """"pyapẽmbuku kuarahy reike gotyogua"""".""  This translates to ""...therefore it is called Hesperonychus, meaning """"western claw foot""""."" 

""Kupygui"" means foot/claw in Guarani. The name *Hesperonychus* directly refers to a characteristic of its feet - its claws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pyapẽ** - While the creature has claws, the name doesn't simply mean ""claw.""
*   **B: Rete perõ** - This doesn't relate to a physical characteristic mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Hu'ã gui** - This refers to the animal's body/frame, and isn't the specific characteristic the name highlights.

* The text states the couple *omenda kuri Texas-pe* (moved to Texas) and then *ou Buffalo-pe oguerovy'a haguã iñangirũ ha hogayguakuéra ndive* (went to Buffalo to raise children and live with their family).  The question asks about their *jejapirehe guare* (where they moved to).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ kuri po ojejukáva jejapípe** (There are four people shown in the picture) - The text mentions four children *involved in the project*, but doesn't say they are *in the picture*.
* **C: Pe pareja omendava'ekue Buffalo-pe ojapo peteĩ ary** (The couple who moved lived in Buffalo for a year) -  They lived in Buffalo *after* Texas, but the text doesn't state the duration of their stay in Buffalo.

(A celebration will be held for them a year later, they told their friends.) and later specifies ""oguerovy'a haguã iñangirũ ha hogayguakuéra ndive"" (to celebrate with family and friends) in Buffalo. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: Oiko peteĩ jevy'ahápe Texas-pe** (There is a party in Texas): They got married in Texas, but the celebration mentioned is in Buffalo.
* **D: Oiko peteĩ pareja omendahape** (There is a couple getting married): They *are* a couple getting married, but the question asks about what is *happening* in the event described.

"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'épa ojepy'apy ypyva'ekue umi funcionario-kuérape Luno rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Sa'i fertilizante carga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ñepyrũrã funcionario-kuéa okyhyje kuri buque oñohẽ mba'éramo peteĩ carga."" which translates to ""first, the officials inspect the ship to see what kind of cargo it carries.""  The ship is carrying a fertilizer cargo (""fertilizante carga""). Therefore, the officials are inspecting the ship *because of* the fertilizer cargo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ola-kuéra ha yvytu hatã (fires and bad weather)** - These are the *reasons* Luno is being used, not what the officials are inspecting.
* **C: Carga ñehẽ (arriving cargo)** - This is too general. The specific type of cargo is important.
* **D: Ñehunga tripulante pa'ũme (accompanying crew)** -  The crew isn't the focus of the inspection.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndaha'éi añete Luno ñemyaña rehe?","The correct answer is **D: Barco oñemyaña rompeolas rehe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Barco oguerekóva 100 metro oho kuri ogueru fertilizante carga jepiverõguáicha ha ñepyrũrã funcionario-kuéa okyhyje kuri buque oñohẽ mba'éramo peteĩ carga."" This translates to: ""A 100-meter boat is going to deliver a fertilizer load, and initially the officials inspected the ship to see what the load was.""  The text then mentions the boat is involved with the ""rompeolas"" (breakwater).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe ñemyaña oiko ojehupi mboyve carga:** (The fire happens after the load) - The passage doesn't directly link the fire to *after* a load is delivered.
* **B: Pe barco oreko kuri 100 metro combustible oikóvõguare ñemyaña:** (The boat with 100 meters of fuel is related to the fire) -  The boat *carries fertilizer*, not fuel, and the passage doesn't explicitly state it's related to the fire.
* **C: Pakõi tripulante pa'ũgui, peteĩ oñehunga:** (With eight crew members, one is missing) - This is a detail about the helicopter crew, not the boat's involvement in the fire.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that directly describes the boat's role in the described situation - working with the breakwater (""rompeolas"")."
Mba'e arykuéra-pe Argelia isãso?,"The correct answer is **C: Arykuéra 1960-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arykuéra 1990 aja ou jey tetã isãso ramóva Argelia ombo'e hag̃ua cine ñemoakã.""  This translates to ""In the 1990s, they went back to independent Algeria to make a film."" This implies Algeria gained independence *before* the 1990s.  Of the options given, the 1960s is the only period when Algeria achieved independence (1962).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Arykuéra 1940-pe:**  Algeria was under French colonial rule in the 1940s.
*   **B: Arykuéra 1950-pe:** The Algerian War of Independence began in 1954, but independence wasn't achieved yet.
*   **D: Arykuéra 1970-pe:**  Algeria had already been independent for a decade by the 1970s.



"
Moõpa ndaipóri raka'e ta'ãnga mbyry funeral ceremonia jehecha hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **A: Roma-me**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Irundy sua ári avakuéra ohókuri **Roma-me** oĩme hag̃ua funeral-pe."" (Many people traveled to **Rome** to attend the funeral.)  It then describes arrangements made *in* Rome to accommodate the crowds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ambue tavakuéra Italia-pe:** While other towns in Italy made arrangements, the funeral *itself* is happening in Rome.
* **C: Peteĩteĩ tenda Polonia-pe:** Poland is mentioned as having similar arrangements for viewing, but not as the location of the funeral.
* **D: Plaza San Pedro-pe:** Plaza San Pedro is *where* some people couldn't fit and were directed to other locations, it's not the general location to view the ceremony.



"
Moõ oiko ra'e funeral ceremonia?,"The correct answer is **C: Plaza San Pedro-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ndaikatui kuri opavave oike funeral hape Plaza San Pedrope.""  This directly translates to ""...not everyone could attend the funeral in Plaza San Pedro.""  This indicates the funeral ceremony itself was *in* Plaza San Pedro.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ambue tenda Roma-me:** While people were directed to other locations *in Rome* to view the ceremony on screens, the ceremony wasn't *in* another location.
* **B: Polonia-pe:** Poland is mentioned as having similar large gatherings, but the funeral itself wasn't there.
* **D: Tenonderã Roma-me ha upéi ambue táva Italia-pe:** The text doesn’t state the ceremony moved to other cities in Italy. It states other cities *also* had gatherings to watch it.



"
"Oiko rire pe jekapu, mávare oñeñangareko herida ivaietereíva rupi?","The correct answer is **A: Po tapicha rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""katu po tapicha oĩva uperupi rehe oñeñangareko oñemondyivaieterei rupi."" This translates to ""but people who were there were taken care of with medical attention.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Avave:** The text says no one was found *inside* the apartment.
* **C: Peteĩ compañía de gas mba’apohára:** The gas company worker investigated the leak, they didn't provide medical attention.
* **D: Peteĩ vecino:** The neighbor *reported* the leak, they didn't provide medical attention.



"
Máva ohenói fuga de gas rupi?,"The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ vecino** (A neighbor).

The text states: ""Peteĩ vecino ohenói rireoĩ rupi fuga de gas."" which translates to ""A neighbor reported a gas leak.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apartamento-pe oikóva** (Someone living in the apartment) - The text doesn't say someone *in* the apartment reported it.
* **C: Peteĩ compañía de gas mba’apohára** (A gas company worker) - The worker *responded* to the report, they didn't *make* it.
* **D: Apartaménto-re oñangarekóva** (Someone evacuated from the apartment) -  They were evacuated *because* of the leak, not because they reported it.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mboy tapicha omano?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Víctima omano va'ekue hína Nicholas Alden, 25 ary, ha Zachary Cuddeback, 21 ary oguerekóva."" This translates to ""The victims include Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old who are deceased."" 

Therefore, two people died."
Máva mboka ndoikóiva’ekue sapy'ánte ataque aja?,"The correct answer is **C: Schneider-gui**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Schneider Katu oikotevẽ opytávo cirugía oemyatyrõ haguã"" (Schneider has to undergo surgery to recover). This indicates Schneider was the one most affected by the attack and needing medical intervention. The text also details the severe injury Schneider sustained (""oñemyatyrõ hova titanio-pe"" - being rebuilt with titanium).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cuddeback-gui:** Cuddeback is mentioned as the attacker, not a victim.
*   **B: Uka-gui:** ""Uka"" means ""that"" or ""the"" and refers to the attack itself, not a person.
*   **D: Alden-gui:** Alden is listed as a victim, but the text doesn't mention the severity of his injuries compared to Schneider.



"
Mávapa ko'ã ñoa'ãrã apytépe ojeiporavo ojeipe'a hag̃ua programa Olímpico-gui?,"The correct answer is **C: Béisbol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""béisbol ha softbol, ojeipe’a va’ekue Juegos Olímpicos ryepýgui 2005 arýpe.""  This translates to ""baseball and softball were removed from the Olympic program in 2005.""  The question asks which sports are being considered to be *removed* from the Olympic program.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Squash** - The text says squash is *trying* to get *into* the Olympic program.
*   **B: Rugby** - The text says rugby is being considered to be *added* to the Olympic program.
*   **D: Karate** - The text says karate is *trying* to get *into* the Olympic program.



"
Máva ko'ã ñoa'ãrã apytépe oiporavo Comité Olímpico Internacional oike jey hg̃ua?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby unión**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rugby, rugby unión ja’eporãitesérõ g̃uarã, ha golf ojeiporavo po apytégui ojegueroike jey hag̃ua Juegos Olímpicos-pe.""  This translates to ""Rugby, especially rugby union, and golf are being considered for re-inclusion in the Olympic Games.""

The other options are mentioned as also *trying* to get included (squash, karate, patines) or were *previously* removed (béisbol and softbol), but rugby union is specifically highlighted as being considered alongside golf.



"
Arthur Guinness omboheraguapy raka'e alquiler St. James's Gate Brewery g̃uarã mboy ary pukukuépa?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The text states: ""P: 24 Jasyporundy 1759-pe, Arthur Guinness omboheraguapýkuri peteĩ alquiler **9.000** ary pukukue St. James's Gate Brewery g̃uarã...""

This directly answers the question of how many years the lease was for.
"
Mboy su sua dólar rupi omongu'e Guinness ary ha ary?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states that Guinness currently costs 10 euro, which is equivalent to US$14.7 per pint. The question asks for the cost in *dollars*, and the closest value given is $14.
"
Mboy tetã Unión Europa-pe ojehasa asy virus H5N1-rupive?,"The correct answer is **C: Pokõi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Francia hína tetã oĩva pokõihápe Unión Europea ryepýpe ohasa asýva ko virus reheve; Austria, Eslovenia, Bulgaria, Grecia ha Italia rapykuéri.""  This translates to: ""France is a country within the European Union that has detected this virus; Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy follow.""

Therefore, six countries (France + the five listed) have detected the H5N1 virus within the European Union. ""Pokõi"" means ""six"" in Guarani.



"
Moõpa ojetopa peteĩ caso ipahaitéva H5N1 virus rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Francia**.

The text explicitly states: ""ojejuhu va’ekue arakõime peteĩ karuguápe Lyon ypýpe, este gotyo Francia-pe."" which translates to ""it was found recently in a farm near Lyon, this happened in France.""  This clearly indicates France is where a case was identified.



"
Araka'épa Haiti oguereko paha mba'asy ojegueraha mboyve umi mbokárakuéra py'aguapy?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi mboka rehe oúva oguahẽ mboyve**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oguahẽ mboyve umi mboka rehe oúva, Haití ndoguerekói ve’ekue mba’eveichagua apañuai ko mba’esy rehegua siglo XIX guive.""  This translates to: ""Before the arrival of the foreigners, Haiti did not have the capacity to deal with this type of problem since the 19th century."" 

This indicates Haiti had issues with diseases *before* the foreigners arrived, and definitely before the 2010 earthquake.  ""Siglo XIX"" refers to the 19th century (1800s), making option B the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Siglo 1800-guive** - While close, the text specifically states *before* the foreigners arrived, not just a time period.
*   **C: Yvyryrýi mboyve** - The earthquake is a more recent event, and the text implies the problem predates it.
*   **D: 2009-pe** - This is too recent; the text clearly states the problem existed long before 2010 (and the 19th century!).



"
Moõgua tembyre oipytyvõ ojegueraha hag̃ua mba'asy?,"The correct answer is **B: Naciones Unidas campamento jerere** (United Nations substandard camps).

Here's why:

The passage states the demand is that the UN camps weren't properly constructed, leading to bacteria entering the Artibonite River and causing the cholera outbreak. The camps are directly linked to the *source* of the problem and thus the reason for the demand/blame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ysyry Artibonite** - The river is where the cholera *spread*, but it wasn't the source of the contamination.
*   **C: 2010-guare yvyryrýi** - The earthquake is the event that *led* to the need for camps, but it didn’t directly cause the cholera.
*   **D: Pe Instituto de Justicia ha Democracia Haiti-gua** - This is an organization conducting a study, not the source of the problem.

Mba'e oñemoneĩ sapy'ami Irlanda-pe?,"La respuesta correcta es **D: Sustancia-kuéra** (Sustancias).

El texto indica que el Ministro de Salud está preocupado por el aprovechamiento de las sustancias que se mencionan y que las condenas por posesión de drogas, incluso las que ya existen, podrían ser consideradas inconstitucionales. Por lo tanto, el tema central es el manejo y la legalidad de las sustancias (drogas).

Las otras opciones no son el foco principal del texto:

*   **A: Ñemonda (Robo)** no se menciona en el texto.
*   **B: Fraude (Fraude)** no se menciona en el texto.
*   **C: Ataque (Ataque)** no se menciona en el texto."
Mba'ére oñeimo'ãva ojapoha pe mba'evai ojeheka?,"The correct answer is **A: Oga sururúre**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""he'i pe kuimba'e oñeimo'ãva ojapoha pe mba'evai ojeheka **óga sururúre**, mba'e ñembyai rãngue.""  This directly translates to ""he says the man is planning to do the trick of seeing **the haunted house**, what he will achieve.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ñembyai teterehe:** The passage mentions *ñembyai* (achievement) but not specifically *teterehe* (easily).
*   **C: Mba'e ñembyai:** This translates to ""what he will achieve"" which is a description *of* what he's doing, not *what* he's doing.
*   **D: Ñemonda:** This doesn't appear in the text and isn't related to the question.



"
"Ombojegua jave, mba'e ndojapói pe oñeimo'ãva ?","The correct answer is **A: Omoambue ñemoñe'ë** (He modifies the spelling).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pe haihechaukaha noñembyaíri teterehe; ñemoambue ojejapo ojeipurúvo ao anambusu hũ oñembojeguáva py'aguapy ha ñe'ã ra'ãnga ndive oñemoambue hag̃ua pe """"O"""" oñemoñe'ẽ hag̃ua """"e"""" michĩvéva rupi.""

This translates to: ""The change doesn't affect the meaning; a modification is made using a lot of effort, with sounds and writing, to change the """"O"""" to be pronounced as """"e"""".""

This directly indicates the person is *modifying the spelling* (ñemoambue ñemoñe'ë) to change pronunciation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ombojegua py'aguapy ra'ãnga ndive** (He uses sounds) - While sounds are *part* of the process, it's not what he *doesn't do*.
*   **C: Ombyai teterehe** (He changes the meaning) - The passage specifically states the change *doesn't* affect the meaning.
*   **D: Oiporu ao anambusu** (He uses a lot of effort) - Again, effort is involved, but it doesn't describe *what* he's doing.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mba'e ndoñembojái tutor Inglés-pegua Karno rehe?","The correct answer is **A: Apohára derecho rehe** (About right law).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oñemboja avei hese opyrũ hague apohára derecho rehe, katu noemoneĩri kuri."" This translates to ""He also began to study about right law, but didn't finish.""  This is the only option directly mentioned as something Karno's English tutor started to do with him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oreko cita temimbo'e ndive** (He has appointments with students): The text mentions he *gives* appointments, not that he *has* them.
* **C: Omoĩhague ñekuave'ẽ oñemboaje'ỹre chupe** (He gives him a talk about his appointment): This describes what the tutor *does* generally, not something specifically Karno did *with* the tutor.
* **D: Oiporu blasfemia mbo'esyrýpe** (He uses blasphemy in his language): This is a criticism of the language used *against* Karno, not something he does with the tutor.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapepa ndojapóiva rehenro Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Turista-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Rolando Mendoza ombokapu pe imetralla M16 umi turistare"" which translates to ""Rolando Mendoza opened fire with an M16 rifle at the tourists.""  Therefore, he took hostages *of the tourists*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tahachi:**  ""Tahachi"" are reporters, and while they were present, Mendoza didn't take *them* hostage.
* **C: Mitãnguéra:** Children were *among* those rescued and affected, but not the initial hostages Mendoza focused on.
* **D: Fotografo-kuéra:** The photographers were involved later, helping a woman escape, not being held hostage themselves.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva rehen-gui ndojepoiri?","The correct answer is **B: Tujakuéra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Poteĩ rehen, upevape oike hina mitã ha tuja kuéra, ojepoi chuguikuéra kuri..."" which translates to ""One of the hostages was a child and elderly people, they were taken hostage..."" 

The question asks who *wasn't* taken hostage. The passage specifically mentions tourists, children, the elderly, and photographers *were* all taken hostage. Therefore, the elderly (tujakuéra) are the correct answer.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, mávapa ombyaty hína teraguapy omoañetegua hag̃ua upe ñemenda meña ojeheguava rehe Brasil-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Ñe'ẽngurukuéra** (Journalists).

The text states: ""Ava ñe'ẽnguru kuera oha'arõ hina ombyaty peteĩ jerurera 1,2 sua teraguapy kuera ogueraha haguã upe Congreso Tetãme Jasypateĩpe.""  This translates to: ""The journalists are working to fill a queue of 1.2 kilometers so they can reach the National Congress in June.""

This directly indicates that journalists are the ones organizing the gathering/queue to influence the amendment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He's mentioned as someone who wants to modify the legislation, not organize a gathering to support it.
* **C: Tupão Católico Romano:** The Catholic Church is mentioned as being *involved* in the amendment, but not as organizing a physical gathering.
* **D: Marta Suplicy:** She proposed the bill, but isn’t organizing the demonstration.



"
Mávape ome'ẽta ñe'ẽngurukuéra pe jerurera?,"The correct answer is **A: Tupão Católico Romano**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upe Tupao Catolico Romano hatã oñemoĩ kuri omoañeteguaseva upe ñemenda meña ojeheguava rehe upe tetãme."" This translates to ""The Catholic Roman Bishop is putting forward the amendment regarding the issues affecting the country.""  Therefore, the *Tupão Católico Romano* (Catholic Roman Bishop) is the one presenting the petition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as someone who wants to modify the legislation, but not as the originator of the petition.
*   **C: Congreso Tetãgua Brasil pegua:** The Congress is *debating* the petition, not presenting it.
*   **D: Tendota São Paulo pegua Marta Suplicy:**  She introduced the *project* (legislation), but not the initial petition.

"Versace mombe'u rupive, mba'épa ojehu heta tapicha oñepyrũ mboyve ombohovái tiémpore?","The correct answer is **A: Ho'a amandau** (It started to rain).

The text states: ""Upéi oky, hatã ha tuicha nde pire rehe ho'a ju ho'aramoguáicha, upéi ho'a amandau, tapichakuéra oñemondyipa, osapukái ha ombetipa ojuehe.""  This translates to: ""Then it started, strong and heavy rain falling on you like a waterfall, then it started to rain, people gathered, took shelter and waited.""

Versace is explaining *why* many people started gathering - it was because it began to rain. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Po aravo'i pe pantalla oĩ tarde** (The time on the screen is late) - While the passage mentions a time on the screen, it doesn't explain why people gathered.
*   **C: Yvytu hatã** (Strong wind) - While the wind is mentioned (70km/h), the rain is what causes people to seek shelter.
*   **D: Okañy chugui hogaygua** (He remembers his relatives) - This is a personal reflection of Armand Versace and doesn't explain the gathering of people.



"
"Versace he'iháicha, araka'e oñepyrũ yvytu hatãvéva?","The correct answer is **A: Mbovymi aravo'i pantalla-pe ohasa rire**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Po aravo'i ohasa rire pantalla-pe, oñepyrũ oipeju yvytu..."" which translates to ""After a storm passed on the screen, it began to rain...""  This directly indicates the storm on the screen *preceded* the rain (and thus the strong wind).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oky rire** - ""After it rained"" - The text says rain *started* after the storm on the screen, not before.
*   **C: Okañy rire chugui heindy** - ""After I felt my head"" - This is a later event in the passage, not the trigger for the rain.
*   **D: Amandau ho'a mboyve** - ""Before eating breakfast"" - This is also a later event and doesn't relate to the start of the rain.



"
"Fred mboyve, mboy yvytupochy ojeregistrava'ekue 35° W kuarahy resẽ gotyo?","The correct answer is **B: Mbohapy**.

The text states: ""...yvytu hatã tuichava mbohapyha ojeregistráva upe 35° W kuarahy resẽ gotyo."" This directly translates to ""the third strongest wind was registered at 35° W longitude.""  ""Mbohapy"" means three.
"
"Fred oĩroguare Cabo Verde isla ykére, moõ gotyo oho hína ra'e?","The correct answer is **D: Yvate kuarahy reike gotyo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fred oguereko hina yvytu oipejuva 105 milla peteĩ aravope (165 km/h) ha **oho hina upe yvate kuarahy reike gotyo**."" (Fred has winds of 105 miles per hour and is heading towards the **northwest**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuarahy reike gotyo** (East) - The text specifies *northwest*, not east.
*   **B: Yvy gotyo** (Land) - This refers to where Fred originated, not its current direction.
*   **C: Kuarahy resẽ gotyo** (West) - Again, the text clearly states *northwest*.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ipya'eve henonderaẽvévagui?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""Upe 802.11n pya'ekue iñakuãvéva umi henonderaẽvévagui, ipya'evéva 600Mbit/s peve.""  This translates to: ""802.11n has the highest speed among the standards, reaching up to 600Mbit/s.""

Therefore, 802.11n is the one mentioned as having the highest speed."
Mba'e oikotevẽ pe 802.11n compatible hag̃ua hapykue gotyo 802.11b ndive?,"The correct answer is **A: Pya'eveva'erã**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pea ikatu hina ojapo chugui compatible hapykue gotyo umi 802.11a, 802.11b ha 802.11g ndive...""  This translates to ""It can be made compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g...""

Therefore, to be compatible with 802.11b, 802.11n *must* be able to work with it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 802.11b oikova'erã 5,0Ghz-pe:**  802.11b operates on 2.4 GHz, not 5.0 GHz.
* **C: Ipya'evéva 600Mbit/s peve:** This is the *maximum* speed of 802.11n, not a requirement for compatibility with 802.11b.  802.11b is much slower.
* **D: Mokõi puhoe:**  While 802.11n *can* have two antennas, this isn't a requirement for compatibility with 802.11b.



"
Mboy jeyta-pe pa pe medallista Olímpico-va oytava'erã ra'e Commonwealth ñembosaráipe?,"The correct answer is **B: Mbohapy**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...medallista oro olímpico-va, oyta ve'erã kuri **100 ha 200 metro aja ha mbohapy relevo** Commonwealth ñembosaráipe..."" This directly translates to ""...the Olympic gold medalist, won medals in 100 and 200 meters and **three relays** at the Commonwealth Games...""

Therefore, the medalist won medals in three relays at the Commonwealth Games."
Mba'ére pe medallista oro Olímpico-va ndo'úi pohã oikotevẽva?,"The correct answer is **C: Okyhyje ijestado físicore ojapo vairamo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Olympic gold medalist *struggles to maintain the physical condition they once had* and therefore *cannot eat properly to support their training, and is competing in the Commonwealth Games despite this*. This directly implies the reason they don't eat well is because of their declining physical state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndahasýi chupe mba'eve** (Nobody tells them what to eat) - The passage doesn't focus on *who* is telling them what to eat, but *why* they can't eat properly.
* **B: Ombohasy chupe** (They are being forced to train) - The passage talks about competing, not being forced.
* **D: Oñembotove rupi ñembosarái Commonwealth-pe** (They are competing in the Commonwealth Games) - This is a *result* of the situation, not the *reason* for their poor diet.

The text states: ""Arai hûva ndoguerekóiva mba'eve actividad volcanica ojehecha kuri pe yvyty ape. Umi arai kuéra ojepresenta kuri pe confusion raicha ndojeikuaai rupi oikopa ra'e pe erupcion."" 

This translates to: ""There is no visible volcanic activity on the surface of the land. These days present confusion, as it's not known if an eruption will occur.""

This directly explains the confusion surrounding the land – the *lack of visible activity* makes it hard to predict if an eruption will happen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe Oficina Meteorológica Islandia-pegua omomarandúva rupi** (Because of the reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office) - The reports *mention* the land, they don't *cause* the confusion.
* **C: Pe mapa Internacional yvy ryrýi rehegua** (Because of the International land map) - The map simply shows the land exists, it doesn’t explain the confusion.
* **D: Oĩhague yvy ryrýi ambue área Islandia-pe** (Because there is land in another area of Iceland) - This is irrelevant to the confusion surrounding *this specific* land.



"
"Ko maranduhai he’iháicha, araka'e oikova’ekue pe cambio de fase?","The correct answer is **C: Jasyapy 10 pe**.

The text states: ""Pe yvyryryi tuichava oiko vaekue pe cambio de fase oiko kuri Jasyapy 10 pe yvate kuarahy reikevo pe volcan apýra caldera gotyo."" This translates to: ""The strong tremor is happening because the phase change is happening on January 10th above the volcano's caldera.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jasyapy 10 mboyve** - The text specifies *on* January 10th, not *before* January 10th.
* **B: 48 aravo ohava vaekue pe** - This refers to 48 hours of monitoring, not the date of the phase change.
* **D: Pe arapokõindy mboyve** - This refers to before the investigation, not the date of the phase change.



"
Mávapa ko'ã mombe'u apytépe sonda Chandrayaan-1 rehegua ndaha'éi añetegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe orbitador opoiva'ekue sonda oreko tripulación** (The orbiter launched a lunar impact probe without crew).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Orbitador lunar no tripulado Chandrayaan-1 opoi sonda de impacto lunar orekóvagui..."" (The unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched an impact lunar probe without crew...)
* This directly contradicts the statement that the probe *was* crewed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe sonda oraha instrumento científico** (The probe carries scientific instruments) - The passage *does* state this, but it's not something the passage says is *not* true.
* **C: Pe sonda jepoi oiko hekoitépe** (The probe fell onto the south pole) - The passage *does* state this, and it's not a contradiction.
* **D: Pe sonda oñembosa’y opahenda rupi** (The probe helped India advance in all areas) - The passage *does* state this, and it's not a contradiction.



"
"Ko'ã apytégui, mávapa ohechaukahai porã pe sonda lunar?","The correct answer is **B: Oguejy hekoitépe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...oguejyha hekoitépe jasy polo sur ypýpe"" which translates to ""...it will head towards the south pole of the moon.""  This directly answers the question of where the lunar probe is going.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oguejy jasy polo norte-pe (It goes to the north pole of the moon):** The passage specifically says it's heading to the *south* pole.
* **C: Ojepoi orbitador tripulado-gui (It was launched from a manned orbiter):** The passage states it was launched from an *unmanned* orbiter (Chandrayaan-1).
* **D: Oraha mokõi instrumento (It has two instruments):** The passage states it has *three* instruments (""Mbohapy instrumento científico..."").



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'e ojeiporuta pahaitépe ojejoko hag̃ua mba'asy?","The correct answer is **A: Vícho jukaha**.

Here's why:

The text states the purpose of the campaign is to *“omotĩmbo vícho jukaha”* (strengthen health). It explains the campaign aims to reach people in vulnerable areas to provide many benefits and *“omotĩmbo vícho jukaha”* (strengthen health).  All other options are *means* to achieve that end, not the end itself.

*   **B: Tapicha oitýva kure** (People living in vulnerable areas) - These are *who* the campaign targets.
*   **C: Vakúna encefalítis rehegua** (Encephalitis vaccine) - This is *how* they aim to improve health.
*   **D: Ñati'ũjokoha** (Benefits) - These are *what* people receive, but not the ultimate goal.



"
Mba'éichapa oñembohasa ko mba'asy yvypórare?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñati'ũ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mba'asy oñembohasa kure rupi, upéi ova yvypórape **ñati'ũ** rupi.""  This translates to ""The disease is transmitted through mosquitoes, then to people through **bites**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vícho jukaha:** This refers to a bad headache, a *symptom* of the disease, not the method of transmission.
* **C: Kure:**  This means ""mosquito"" - the *vector* of the disease, not how it's passed to people.
* **D: Tapicha oitýva kure:** This means ""people who live with mosquitoes"" - it doesn't describe *how* the disease is transmitted.



"
Mba'e ikatu oiko ñe'ẽsyry mokõiha fracaso rupi?,"The correct answer is **A: HJR-3 ojehecha jeýta**.

Here's why:

The text states that *because* the second bill failed (due to lack of enough votes to amend the constitution), HJR-3 would be considered by the legislature in 2015 or 2016.  This shows HJR-3 is a *result* of the second bill's failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tapicha imeña ojoeheguáva omenda hag̃ua oñondive ágã tenonderãve** - This is the *reason* the second bill failed, not what happened *because* of the failure.
* **C: Sesión legislativa apúrope** -  The text doesn't say the legislative session ended *because* of the bill's failure.
* **D: Oñembotoveta tapicha imeña ojoeheguáva omenda hag̃ua oñondive** - Similar to B, this is a cause of the failure, not a consequence.



"
"Ko maranduha he’iháicha, araka'e oñembogue ra'e pe ñe'ẽsyry mokõiha?","The correct answer is **B: 2011-pe**.

The text states: ""Enmienda oje'éva omboajéma kuri mokõive cámara 2011-pe."" (The amendment was introduced to both chambers in 2011.) This directly answers the question of when the second bill was introduced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sesión legistaliva jave** - While it was introduced *during* a legislative session, the text specifies *when* - 2011.
* **C: Arakõime** - This means ""later"" and doesn't specify a date. The bill failed initially and was revisited later, but the introduction date was 2011.
* **D: 2015-pe** - The text says HJR-3 was considered in 2015/2016, but this refers to a *reconsideration* of the amendment, not the initial introduction of the second bill.



"
Mávape oñembotyky ra'e pe “Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Firma Mossack Fonseca-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Panama Papers ha'e hina peteĩ apy tuicha umi 10 sua rupi kuatia kuera upe Panama pegua firma tekopegua **Mossack Fonseca**...""  (Panama Papers is one of the largest leaks of 10 million documents from the Panamanian firm **Mossack Fonseca**...).

The papers were *about* the activities of Mossack Fonseca, and the leak originated from their documents.  The other options are involved in the story, but the papers themselves were leaked *from* Mossack Fonseca.

Mávapa ko'ãva accidente aéreo-kuérape oĩ hetave omanóva?,"The correct answer is **A: Avión ho'ava'ekue ohóva hina Armenia-pe Irán-guive** (The plane that was going from Iran to Armenia).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jasy ohasa va’ekuépe, Irán ohecha desastre aéreo tuichavéva peteĩ avión de pasajero ohóva Armenia-pe ho’árõ guare, ojukávo 168 tapicha ohóva ipype."" This translates to ""Last month, Iran witnessed a major air disaster with a passenger plane heading to Armenia, resulting in the death of 168 people."" This is the accident with the highest number of fatalities mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Accidente de helicóptero policía mba’éva** (The police helicopter accident) - This resulted in injuries, but fewer than the plane crash.
*   **C: Avión ho'ava'ekue ohóva hína kuri Irán gotyo Armenia-guive** (The plane that was going from Armenia to Iran) - The text specifies the plane was *going to* Armenia *from* Iran.
*   **D: Avión ombetiva'ekue Mashhad-pe** (The plane that landed in Mashhad) - While it was an accident, it only caused a few injuries.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndaha'éi peteĩ mba’e mba'érepa oiko heta accidente aéreo Irán-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Sanción orekóva ndaikatui ojogua avión pyahu** (Sanctions prevent the acquisition of new aircraft parts).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Sanción internacional orekóva he’ise ndaikatuiha ojogua avión pyahu."" (International sanctions mean they cannot acquire aircraft parts.) This directly links the sanctions to a potential reason for the accidents – older, poorly maintained aircraft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Flota tuja ojeiporúva operación civil ha militar-rã** (Old fleet used for civil and military operations) - While true, this is a *result* of the situation, not the *reason* for the accidents.
* **B: Ndorekói hikuái pira pire avión pyahu ojogua hag̃ua** (There are no spare parts to repair aircraft) - This is related, but the *cause* of the lack of spare parts is the sanctions.
* **D: Peteĩ flota tuja oñeñangarekoporã’ỹva** (An old fleet) - Similar to A, this describes the situation but doesn't explain *why* the fleet is old and potentially unsafe.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndaipóri kuri Irak Jetypekaha Aty marandupe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñe'ẽreoity ko Ejecutivo politica ko'agãguare** (Discussion of the Executive's policy regarding Iraq).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Upe Marandu oñe'ẽreoity hatã aimete opavave mba'ere ko Ejecutivo politica ko'agãguare Irak rehegua..."" (The Report discusses in detail what the Executive's policy is regarding Iraq...).  This is a direct statement about what the report *does*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Violencia jejupi Iraq-pe ikatuha ojejoko** (Violence in Iraq could occur) - The passage *mentions* the possibility of violence, but it's not what the report *is about* primarily. It's a consequence discussed.
* **C: Recomendacion ojeasegura hag̃ua Irak frontera** (Recommendation to secure Iraq's borders) - This is *one* of the 78 recommendations, but not the overall focus of the report.
* **D: Peteĩ jejure tojejapo ñemoñe'ẽ Estados Unidospe** (A hearing will be held in the United States) - This is a potential *result* of the report, not the report's core content.



"
Mávapa ko'ã apytépe ndojejeruréi Irak Jetypekaha Aty marandupe?,"The correct answer is **D: Peteĩ iniciativa diplomatica puahu jejapo** (A strong diplomatic initiative to be carried out).

Here's why:

The text states: ""ha'e hina peteĩ iniciativa diplomatica puahu ojejapo vaerã opa mboyve ko ary oje asegura haguã Irak frontera kuera umi intervencion hostil ha tojeguereko jevy relacion diplomatica umi tetã kuera ijykeregua ndive."" This directly translates to ""one of the 78 recommendations is a strong diplomatic initiative to be carried out this year to secure Iraq's borders from hostile interventions and to maintain good diplomatic relations with neighboring countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ garantía ojejoko hag̃ua violencia** (A guarantee to end violence) - While the overall goal is to reduce violence, the *recommendation itself* is not a guarantee, but an initiative.
* **B: Tojejapo taha'e ha'eva** (To do what has been done) - The text indicates a need for *new* action, not repetition of past actions.
* **C: Tojejapo ñemongetajovái** (To carry out an investigation) - The text mentions a potential investigation related to US policy, but it's not the main recommendation of the report.



"
"Tahachi he'ívare, mávava’ekue Provenzano jehecharamove?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tahachikuéra he'íkuri Lo Piccolo oguereko changui ha'égui Provenzano jehecharamove Palermo-pe...""  This directly translates to ""Tahachi reported that Lo Piccolo had contacts and was close to Provenzano in Palermo...""

Therefore, Lo Piccolo is the one reported to be close to Provenzano.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, mba'ére omano Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Ojejuka Riina ñorairõme** (He was killed in Riina's war).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ombopaharõ guare upe Riina ñorãirõ tetãete rovake oguerahava'ekue umi Mafia joasa rekove Giovanni Falcone ha Paolo Borsellino 1992-me"" which translates to ""...they joined Riina's state war that cost the lives of Mafia fighters Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""  This clearly indicates Falcone died *because of* Riina's war/conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tahachi ojuka chupe** (Tahachi killed him) - The passage mentions Tahachi's involvement in a broader context, but doesn't directly state they killed Falcone.
*   **C: Oje'e Lo Piccolo-pe ojuka hag̃ua chupe** (Lo Piccolo was ordered to kill him) - Lo Piccolo is mentioned as having a connection, but not as the direct perpetrator.
*   **D: Ojuka chupe ambue mafia joasa rekove Paolo Borsellino** (He was killed by another Mafia fighter Paolo Borsellino) - The passage states they *both* died in the same conflict, not that one killed the other.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytépe ndaha'éiva'ekue Hitoshi Saito apore?,"The correct answer is **D: Judoca**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what Hitoshi Saito *is* (his profession/identity).** The passage clearly states he is a ""Judoca"" (judo practitioner).
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Mokõi jey Campeón arapýpe ha'evéva (Two-time Olympic Champion):** While true, this describes an *achievement* of Saito, not what he *is*.
    * **B: Saito Judo ha'e Japón-gua Aty Mburuvicha kuri (Saito Judo is the head of the Japanese team):** This is a consequence of his status as a respected judoka, but not his core identity.
    * **C: Oguereko mokõi medalla olimpica itajúgui ojejapóva (He has two Olympic gold medals):**  Again, this is an *achievement*, not what defines him.

Therefore, **D: Judoca** is the most fundamental and accurate answer to the question.



"
Moõgui Iwasaki okañy ñemendagui?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...okañy kuri ñemendagui Nepal-pe..."" which translates to ""...he fled to Nepal..."" 

Therefore, Iwasaki fled *to* Nepal.



"
Mávapa oataca Iwasaki-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ jagua** (A rabid dog).

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""Tibet katu oataka chupe jagua rabioso..."" which translates to ""Tibet sent a rabid dog after him...""  Therefore, Iwasaki was attacked by a rabid dog.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hembirekorã** (Embassy) - The text doesn't mention an embassy attacking him.
*   **B: Pirata-kuéra** (Pirates) - While pirates *attacked* him, the question asks *what* attacked him, and the dog is a more direct answer related to the specific event described.
*   **D: Tahachi** (Nothing) - The text clearly states something attacked him.



"
Araka'e omohu'ã Alonso pe carrera?,"The correct answer is **A: Schumacher rueda oñemoĩvai rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ikatu va’ekue oiko peteĩ rueda oñemoĩvai rupi"" which translates to ""...he could have a wheel put on because of it."" This directly relates to Alonso and a potential issue with a wheel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Fisichella ndaipu’akavéi rupi imba’yrumýi rehe** - This refers to Fisichella's feelings, not what happened *to* Alonso.
*   **C: Schumacher omopu'ã rupi carrera rire** - Schumacher finished *after* Alonso, not before.
*   **D: Oĩ mboyve kuri tenondete** - While there was competition, the question asks specifically what happened *to* Alonso.



"
Mba'ére Schumacher omopu'ã voi pe carrera?,"The correct answer is **D: Mba'yrumýi suspensión oñembyai rupi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher omohu’ã carrera Alonso riremi, suspensión oñembyai rupi hatã oñorairõ rupi carrera aja.""  This translates to ""Michael Schumacher abandoned the race after Alonso, due to a broken suspension, in order to avoid a bigger accident.""

Therefore, Schumacher stopped racing because of a suspension failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndaipu’akavéi rupi imba’yrumýi rehe** (Because of Fisichella's accident) - The text doesn't say Schumacher's accident was *because* of Fisichella's.
*   **B: Ombeti rupi Alonso-rehe** (Following Alonso) - He stopped *after* Alonso, but not *following* him as a consequence.
*   **C: Rueda oñemoĩvai rupi Fisichella** (Fisichella's wheel problem) - This refers to Fisichella, not Schumacher.



"
"Ko maranduhai rupive, máva rembiapo ha'e ñemonambi?","The correct answer is **A: Tahachi omonambi vaekue**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko 3 jasy pahape, **80 ari oñemonambi vaekue** ojepoi upe Central Booking instalaciongui oñemombe'u'yrẽ hekópe.""  This directly translates to ""For the past 3 months, **80 people have been arrested** using the Central Booking installation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tekojojahára Glynn:** He's a detective who *receives* a report, he doesn't *do* the arresting.
* **C: Pe Central Booking instalacion:**  This is a *location* where arrests are processed, not the entity doing the arresting.
* **D: Ava corte-gua:** These are court officials, not those making the arrests.



"
"Pe kuatia ipuku'ỹva rupive, mba'e oñemonambiva’ekue ikatu ojapo ojejoko hag̃ua 24 aravo rire?","The correct answer is **A: Fianza**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upe comisionado omoĩ **fianza**, oñeme'ẽro, ha omoĩ hekópe pe mombe'u ojapo vaekue tahachi omonambi vaekue."" (The commissioner gives a **bail**, a receipt, and records the booking information in the system.)

The question asks what can be done to be released after 24 hours, and the text directly links the bail (fianza) to the release process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemongeta tahachi omonambiva’ekue ndive (With the booking information)** - The booking information *records* the process, it doesn't *enable* release.
* **C: Mombe'u ojapova’ekue Tekojojahára Glynn (The booking made by Prosecutor Glynn)** - The booking is a step, but it’s the *fianza* that facilitates release.
* **D: Peteĩ audiencia (An audience/hearing)** - An audience ensures rights are upheld, but isn't the direct mechanism for release after 24 hours as stated in the text.

"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mba’e ndojeiporúi oñemyesakã hag̃ua mba’érepa ojehapejoko jeporavo jevy?","The correct answer is **A: Ñemongyhyje oguerúva (The arriving refugees)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the reason for wanting a new deal with Afghanistan is to *prevent* the influx of refugees and to *manage* the arriving refugees (ñemongyhyje oguerúva). The entire context revolves around controlling the refugee situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tetã Kuatiaguasu imba’eavyha (Afghanistan's political instability)** - While mentioned as a factor, it's not *what* they're trying to prevent with a new deal – it's the consequence (refugees) they're trying to manage.
* **C: Heta viru (A lot of resources)** -  The text doesn't focus on resources.
* **D: Tetã Kuatiaguasu nahesakãporãi (The superpower is not cooperating)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Mba’érepiko ipahápe umi oñe’ẽkuaáva he’i ojehapejoko jeporavo jevy?,"The correct answer is **A: Tetã Kuatiaguasúpe imba’eavýkuri** (It exists in the great country).

Here's why:

The passage states the speakers believe the reason for the bad situation (related to Afghans using drugs and causing problems elsewhere) is because the ""great country"" (presumably meaning a powerful nation) allows this to happen. They believe the bad situation will stop *when* the problem is moved to that great country – implying the problem *exists* there already in some form.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩkuri ñemongyhyje rehegua** (It is about drug use) - While the passage mentions drug use, the speakers aren't saying *that* is what they're referring to, but rather the situation *caused by* it.
* **C: Oĩkuri heta mba’e nahesakãporãiva Tetã Kuatiaguasúpe** (There are many bad things in the great country) -  The passage doesn't state there are *many* bad things, just that allowing this problem to exist there will worsen things.
* **D: Pe jeporavo jevy hepyetereíkuri** (The bad situation is worsened) - This describes a *result* of the situation, not what the speakers are referring to.



"
Mávapiko ome’ẽ tekojoja kuave’ẽmby FATA-pe g̃uarã?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi agente político** (The political agents).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the ""Agente Político"" (Political Agents) are responsible for administering and maintaining security in FATA, and their authority is detailed in Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution. While the President of Pakistan appoints them, *they* are the ones directly providing the administration and security.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A & C: Paquistán mburuvicha (President of Pakistan):** The President appoints the agents but doesn't directly *provide* the administration and security.
*   **D: Britanico-kuéra mburuvicha (British authorities):**  The text states Pakistan gained independence in 1947, so British authorities are no longer in charge.

The text states the ""Agente Político"" (Political Agent) is responsible for administration and ""opita tetã rekuái ha tekojoja kuave'ẽmby ñeme'ẽ ipyendáva Art. 247-pe Pakistán Léi Guasúpe"" – which translates to ""deals with the state's recovery and administrative support as defined in Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.""  This directly points to administrative support being their role.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oiporavókuri chupekuéra Paquistán mburuvicha** (The President of Pakistan appoints them) - While likely true, the text doesn't *specifically* state this as a core function.
* **C: Oñemopyenda Paquistán Léi Guasu rehe** (They are based on the Pakistan Constitution) - The Constitution *defines* their role, but it’s not what they *do*.
* **D: Oisãmbyhy hikuái haimete tenda tuichakue javeve** (They work to maintain peace and tranquility) - This is a likely outcome of their administration, but not the direct function stated.

The text states: ""Gosling ha Stone ojapyhy ñembohéra actor ha actriz porãvevape guara."" (Gosling and Stone were nominated for best actor and best actress awards.)

Therefore, Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress.



"
Mba’e premio-pe oñembohérakuri pe ta’ãngamýi?,"The correct answer is **D: Purahéi teete iporãvéva** (Best Original Song).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mokõi purahéi upe ta'ãngaryryipegua, Audición (The Fools Who Dream) ha Táva Mbyjakueraguigua, ojapyhy purahéi ñembohéra iporãveva teetépe g̃uarã.""  This directly translates to ""...two songs from the film, Audition (The Fools Who Dream) and City of Stars, were nominated for the best original song award.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ta’ãnga iporãvéva** (Best Picture) - While the film received nominations, the text specifically highlights the song nominations.
*   **B: Efectos visuales iporãvéva** (Best Visual Effects) - The text doesn't mention visual effects nominations.
*   **C: Mba’epu mbojehe’a iporãvéva** (Best Production Design) - The text mentions production design as a nomination, but it's not the *specific* award highlighted.

Ko’ãva apytégui mávapa oiko gueteri pe yvyryrýi rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Opavave reactor pe planta Shika Hokuriku-peguápe** (All reactors at the Shika plant in Hokuriku).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant are being stopped (""oñembotyha"").  The question asks what is being stopped *after* the earthquake.  Therefore, the reactors are the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aeropuerto Ishikawa-pe** (Ishikawa Airport) - The airport is *closed* due to the earthquake, but isn't being stopped as a direct result of damage.
* **C: Opavave servicio ferroviario** (All railway services) - Railway services are being checked, but not necessarily stopped completely. The text says they are ""evaluating"" them.
* **D: Peteĩ central eléctrica Niigata-pe** (A power plant in Niigata) - The Kashiwazaki Kariwa plant is being *checked*, not stopped.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. nomomarandúi yvyryrýi ombyaíva ha umi reactor 1 ha 2 planta de energía nuclear de Shika-pegua oñembotyha.""  This translates to: ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. reported that the earthquake caused damage and reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were stopped.""

The question asks what was stopped due to the earthquake. The answer is the two reactors at the Shika plant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oĩmimi ogakuéra** (There are many people) - While the text mentions 9400 households potentially affected, it doesn't state people were *stopped*.
*   **C: Oĩ tape oñembyaíva** (There is a road blocked) -  This is a consequence of the earthquake but not what was directly stopped.
*   **D: Noto aeropuerto** (Noto Airport) - The airport is closed, but the question focuses on what was stopped *because* of the earthquake's impact.

The text specifically mentions Jerusalén Estado (Jerusalem State) and its disputed status, suggesting it's a key point of contention. The passage highlights that it's a major factor related to the frontier issues discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly relevant:

* **B: Ñorãirõ 1967-peguare mba’érepa oikoraka’e** (Why the 1967 war happened): While the 1967 war is *context* for the frontier issues, the passage doesn't delve into the *reasons* for the war itself. It focuses on the *result* - the disputed frontiers.
* **C: Umi militar ñeime ñúme** (The names of the soldiers): The text only mentions the presence and duration of the military presence, not their names.
* **D: Jeikovai frontera rehe** (Discussion about the frontier): This is too broad. The passage *is* about frontiers, but it's a starting point, not the core issue needing further exploration. The specific issue is *what* is being disputed about the frontiers, and Jerusalem is central to that.



"
"Ko’ã apytégui, mávapa ndaha’éi Palestina mba’ejerure?","The correct answer is **A: Umi frontera oñemopyendáva umi condición ñorãirõ mboyveguare rehe** (The borders established by the conditions before the war).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Palestina oipotáva omopyendáva umi frontera Medio Oriente ñorairõ 1967-guápe"" (Palestine seeks to establish the borders of the Middle East war of 1967). This means Palestine's claim is *based on* the borders that existed *before* the 1967 war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Militar-kuéra ñeime pe Jordán ñúme:** The passage mentions military presence *on* the Jordan River, but doesn't say this is what defines Palestine.
* **C: Mbohovái pe Jerusalén renonderã rehegua:** While Jerusalem is mentioned, the passage states a dispute *over* its status, not that claiming it defines Palestine.
* **D: Militar-kuéra ñeime po ary pukukue pe Jordán ñúme:**  This refers to a specific detail about Israeli military presence, not a defining characteristic of Palestine's claim.



"
Mba’e tetãme Ma ojetavy'ova'ekue derecho-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos America-gua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ma ojetavy'o kuri Mbo'ehaguasu Nueva York ha Facultad de Derecho Harvard-peguápe ha peteĩ jey oguereko va'ekue upe """"green card"""" residencia permanente Estados Unidos pegua.""  This translates to: ""He studied at New York University and Harvard Law School and eventually obtained a 'green card' for permanent residency in the United States.""

Therefore, Ma studied law in the United States.



"
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mba’e tetã oipytyvõkuri Ma ogana hag̃ua jeporavópe?","The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos America-gua**.

Here's why:

The text states Ma has a ""green card"" (residencia permanente) in the **Estados Unidos** (United States). This means the US provides him with the legal basis to reside and potentially thrive there, aiding his political aspirations.  The text also mentions his education at universities in the US (Nueva York and Harvard).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hong Kong** - He was *born* in Hong Kong, but doesn't currently rely on Hong Kong for political support.
* **C: Reino Unido (United Kingdom)** - The text doesn't mention any connection to the UK.
* **D: China** - While he has a stance *regarding* China, the text suggests his platform involves opposing China, not being supported by it.



"
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mávape g̃uarã omba’apova’ekue Carolyn Wilson oho mboyve távagui?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""opavave ogaygua kuera oimevaekue involucrado upepe opilla Carolyn Wilson, **OHA pegua**, omonda ra'e isegurida deposito kuera, ha oho ra'e pe távagui."" 

This directly translates to: ""Everyone involved in this knew Carolyn Wilson, **from OHA**, who was taking the security deposits and leaving the country.""

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson works for OHA and that's why she was taking deposits and leaving. The other options are locations or housing complexes mentioned in the text, but not the organization Carolyn Wilson is associated with.



"
"Hembývo irundy carrera opa hag̃ua ko temporada, máva oĩ irundyhápe ko Campeonato de Pilotos-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hamlin veinte punto reheve tapykuévo"" (Hamlin is twenty points behind). This places him in fourth position in the championship standings with four races remaining. The question asks who is in fourth place.

Let's break down the standings to confirm:

1. Keselowski: 2,250 points
2. Johnson: 2,243 points
3. Bowyer: (5 points behind Johnson) - 2,238 points
4. Hamlin: (20 points behind Bowyer) - 2,218 points
5. Kahne: 2,220 points
6. Truex, Jr.: 2,207 points



"
"Pe carrera oje’eva’ekue oikohague rire, mboy punto oguereko Kahne pe Campeonato de Pilotos-pe?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne ha Truex, Jr. Oĩ po ha poteĩhápe ojoapykuéri 2.220 ha 2.207 punto reheve."" This directly tells us Kahne currently has 2,220 points. The question asks how many points Kahne has *after* the race, and the text doesn't mention any points being added or subtracted for Kahne specifically. Therefore, he still has 2,220 points."
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mboy jeýpa tapichakuéra ohecha ho’árõ umi meteorito ha upe rire ojejuhu ouhague marte-gui?","The question asks how often people see meteorites fall after they've been detected coming from Mars. The text states: ""Umi 24.000 meteorito ojeikuaáva ho’ahague yvy ape ári apytépe, 34 añónte ojejuhu ouhague marte-gui."" This translates to ""Of the 24,000 meteorites detected falling to Earth, 34 were found to have come from Mars.""

The phrase ""34 añónte ojejuhu ouhague marte-gui"" indicates that after detecting them falling, it took 34 years to confirm their origin as Mars. The question is *how often* people *see* them fall after detection. The text doesn't give a frequency of *sightings* but rather the time it took to *confirm* their Martian origin.  However, the context strongly suggests these are rare events, and 34 years is a significant amount of time.

Looking at the options:

* **A: Pa jey (Once a year)** - Highly unlikely given the 34-year timeframe for confirmation.
* **B: Po jey (Twice a year)** - Also unlikely, same reasoning as above.
* **C: Papo jey (Rarely)** - This best reflects the information given.  Finding 34 Martian meteorites *out of 24,000* detected over time indicates rarity.
* **D: Mbohapypa irundy jey (Four times every year)** - This is completely inconsistent with the text.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Papo jey**.



"
"Oñemombe’uháicha pe ehẽnguépe, mba’épa umi mba’e añeteguáva umi ita ojejuhuva’ekue rehegua oje’éva ouhague marte-gui?","The correct answer is **A: Opavavete umíva ojejuhuva’ekue upe lluvia de meteorito jasypokõime** (Everything that falls during the meteor shower in September).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what the text says about the things that fall from Mars.** The passage specifically states that the meteorites are believed to originate from Mars and that their fall is associated with the September meteor shower (""lluvia de meteorito jasypokõi ohasa va’ekuére guare apytépe"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ 24.000 hesekuérava** (There are 24,000 of them) - This refers to the *total* number of meteorites hitting Earth, not specifically those from Mars.
* **C: Oñemoñemu 11.000 dólares hepyve órogui** (They are worth 11,000 dollars more than gold) - This is about the *value* of certain meteorites, not their origin.
* **D: Oĩ 34 añónte** (There are 34 years) - This refers to the time it takes for these meteorites to be found after falling, not their origin.



"
Araka’épiko oñemomombyryva’ekue Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **B: Osẽrire tenonde campeonato-pe pokõi jey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Schumacher, oñemomombyrýva 2006-pe osẽrire tenonde campeonato de Formula 1-pe pokõi jey...""  This directly translates to ""Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning his seventh championship..."" 

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Oñaccidenta rire Felipe Massa:** The text states Massa had an accident *after* Schumacher retired.
*   **C: Omyengovia rire Felipe Massa-pe:** The text says Schumacher competed *against* Massa, not after competing against him.
*   **D: Opa rire pe temporada 2009:** The text relates to Massa's 2009 season, but doesn't state when Schumacher retired in relation to the end of that season.



"
Araka’épa hasýva’ekue Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ Gran Premio aja** (Just one Grand Prix).

Here's why:

The text states Massa ""oinupã hatãiterei iñakã peteĩ accidente oiko va’ekue Gran Premio de Hungría-pe 2009 arýpe"" - meaning he missed a Grand Prix due to an accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Osẽrire tenonde campeonato de Formula 1-pe** (He retired from the Formula 1 championship) - The text says he missed a season, not that he retired.
*   **C: Schumacher oñemomombyry mboyve** (Before Schumacher retired) - This is context, not the reason for Massa's absence.
*   **D: Temporada 2009 mboyve** (Before the 2009 season) - He missed *during* the 2009 season.

"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mba'épa ko oñemohendáva hendaguépe ikatu ojapo AOL-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Ikatuete ojupive AOL poruharakuéra retakue.** (AOL's shareholders could benefit.)

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage states that because AOL is a leader in instant messaging and the US market, and Yahoo! and Microsoft are showing interest in AOL's customers, ""ko oñemohendáva hendaguépe, ko sãso ikatu opa hína"" - meaning ""this development, this situation could benefit everyone.""
* **Why A is correct:** The ""everyone"" being referred to most directly and logically is AOL's shareholders.  If Yahoo! and Microsoft are interested in acquiring AOL's customer base, that increases AOL's value and benefits those who own stock in the company.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: AOL añónte ha’éta empresa omongu'e ha ombohekóva pe mensajería instantánea mercado-pe.** (AOL is large and is a company that leads and controls the instant messaging market.) - While true, this is *stated* in the passage, not what the development *causes* to happen. It's background information, not the consequence.
* **C: Umi AOL poruhára retakue ombohováita umi Yahoo ha Microsoft puruhára.** (AOL's shareholders will meet with Yahoo and Microsoft shareholders.) - The passage doesn't mention any meetings, just interest.
* **D: AOL ndojeiporuvéitama Estados Unidos-pe.** (AOL is not used in the United States.) - The passage specifically states the opposite: ""tuichaháicha ojeiporu rupi Estados Unidos-pe"" (it is heavily used in the United States).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko’ágã peve, AOL ikatu omongu’e ha omboheko mensajería instantánea mercado ha’e oipotahaichaite..."" (Translation: ""However, AOL can control and support the instant messaging market as it is positioned..."")
* **The question asks:** What makes it possible for everything to be controlled in the future?
* **Option C** directly reflects the power AOL has to control the market, as stated in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Internet jeguerojeraguasu Estados Unidos-pe (The internet grows larger in the United States):** While relevant to the context of messaging, it doesn't explain *how* control is possible.
* **B: Pe mensajería instantánea mercado jeiporu (The instant messaging market is successful):** Success doesn't guarantee control.
* **D: Yahoo ha Microsoft joaju (Yahoo and Microsoft join):** Their joining is mentioned as a reaction to AOL's power, not as the reason for the potential control.

Mboy umi tapicha omanova’ekue apytégui ndaha’éikuri tahachi?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The text states: ""Upe mburuvicha oficina guive he'i kuri 19 ojedegrasia vaekue ha'eha tahachi."" which translates to ""The governor's office said 19 were injured in the attack.""

Therefore, 19 people were reported injured *as* police officers."
Mávapa odenunciakuri pe sospechoso del atake-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Tahachi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tahachi kuera omalisia hina ikatu hague upe Daesh (ISIL) milíko ojapo pe atake."" This translates to ""The attackers are suspected of being the ones who carried out the attack by the Daesh (ISIL) military.""  The text directly identifies the *tahachi* (attackers) as the suspects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mburuvicha oficina guive (The chief of the office):** While the chief of the office provided information about the number of injured, they didn't *denounce* the suspect.
* **C: Momaranduhára (Reporter):** The text doesn't mention a reporter making a denunciation.
* **D: Gaziantep-peguakuéra (People of Gaziantep):**  The people of Gaziantep are victims, not the ones making the accusation.

"Florida herakuãgui ha’eha pe Estado ha'evéva oguerapaitehápe, mba'épa oñeme'ẽkuri Mitt Romney-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Opavave delegado estado-pegua** (All the state's delegates).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Florida ome'ẽ kuri 50 delegado Romney-pe"" (Florida gives 50 delegates to Romney).  This means if Romney wins Florida, he gets *all* of Florida's delegates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 32 delegado estado-pegua** - This is Newt Gingrich's percentage, not what Romney receives.
* **B: Partido Republicano candidatura** - While winning Florida helps Romney toward the nomination, it doesn't *directly* give him the candidacy.
* **D: 46% umi oiporavóva chupe** - This is Romney's poll percentage, not the number of delegates he receives.



"
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mboy porcentaje oiporavóva chupe ohupytýkuri Gingrich ha'eve hag̃ua umi jeiporavo peteĩhápe?","The correct answer is **D: 35%**.

Here's how to calculate it:

* **Total votes for Romney and Gingrich:** 46% + 32% = 78%
* **Votes needed for Gingrich to tie:** To tie, Gingrich would need to reach 46% (Romney's percentage).
* **Percentage Gingrich needs to gain:** 46% - 32% = 14%
* **Percentage Gingrich needs to reach to have a 50/50 tie:** (100% - 46%) / 2 = 27% 
* **Difference between current percentage and that 50/50 tie:** 32% - 27% = 5%
* **Votes for candidates other than Romney and Gingrich:** 100% - 78% = 22%. Assuming those votes are evenly split, 11% goes to Gingrich.
* **Gingrich total when factoring in split votes:** 32% + 11% = 43%
* **Difference between 43% and 46% (Romney):** 3%.
* **To be close to half of the votes it would be:** (46% + 43%) / 2 = 44.5%.
* **Percentage that Gingrich is from the total:** (43% / 78%) * 100% = ~55%.
* **Percentage that Romney is from the total:** (46% / 78%) * 100% = ~59%.

However, based on the information provided, the problem is asking how much percentage is needed for Gingrich to be close to half of the total, given Romney has 46% and Gingrich has 32%. The closest answer from the available options is 35%. The phrasing of the question is tricky but based on the available answers, the closest we can get is 35%.

This translates to: ""Gingrich supports Santorum, but speaks ill of Romney, and many campaign announcements have come out in Iowa focusing on Gingrich.""

This indicates that Gingrich is actively involved and being discussed as a candidate, implying he is still in the race after the Iowa caucus. The other candidates are mentioned as making statements *about* the race or their future plans, not necessarily *staying* in it.

"
"Ojejesarekóvo umi mba’e oikóvare, mávapa oñe’ẽ porãiterei ambue candidato rehe osẽ rire ojehupytýva caucus-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Gingrich oguerohory Santorum-pe, katu iñe’ẽpohýi Romney-pe, hérape osẽ rupi heta anuncio de campaña ivaíva lowa-pe Gingrich-pe ojehova api hag̃ua."" 

This translates to: ""Gingrich supports Santorum, but speaks ill of Romney, with many campaign announcements in Iowa appearing to benefit Gingrich."" This clearly indicates Gingrich is talking *about* another candidate (Romney) after the caucus results started coming in, specifically using announcements to his advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bachmann** - The text says she's trying to *revitalize* her campaign, not talking about others.
*   **C: Romney** - Gingrich is the one speaking *about* Romney, not the other way around.
*   **D: Perry** - Perry focuses on his own strategy in Texas and South Carolina, not commenting on other candidates after the Iowa caucus.

Therefore, after 2015, the broadcast could be found on AstroNet Radio.

Here's why:

The passage states the message within the broadcast is """"ymaguare puhoe ñoha'ãnga oguerekóva peteĩ mba'ekuaaiterei jere ipyahu ha itapiagua'ỹva!"""".  This directly translates to ""a fantastic broadcast containing a mysterious message!""  Therefore, ""ymaguare"" (fantastic) is the descriptor of the broadcast's content.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amateur:** While the broadcast *includes* amateur radio enthusiasts, it doesn't *describe* the message itself.
*   **B: Mba'ekuaaiterei:**  This means ""mysterious"" - it describes the *message*, not the broadcast as a whole.
*   **D: Upe gotyogua:** This refers to a person from Texas and is irrelevant to the overall message description.

This translates to: ""Informant David Headley saw and provided assistance to help these 10 individuals, Pakistani militants affiliated with the Laskhar-e-Taiba group, carry out the operation.""

The question asks what David Headley provided to help the militants. The text clearly says he was an informant and *provided assistance*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umi granada (The grenades)** - Grenades were *used* in the attack, but not provided *by* Headley.
*   **C: Tapichakuéra mbokareheve (The individuals/militants)** - He helped *facilitate* their actions, he didn't *provide* them.
*   **D: Arma automática (Automatic weapons)** - Similar to grenades, weapons were used, but not explicitly stated as provided by Headley.

The text states: ""Ha'e operde ramoite kuri Raonic ndive upe Brisbane openpe."" This translates to ""He lost just now to Raonic in the Brisbane Open.""  Losing means Nadal did *not* win; Raonic won.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic ohupytýkuri 88% umi punto neto-gui** (Raonic won 88% of the net points) - The text says *Nadal* won 88% of the net points, not Raonic.
* **C: Nadal ogana Raonic-pe** (Nadal won against Raonic) - This is directly contradicted by the text.
* **D: Raonic ojapo 76 punto** (Raonic scored 76 points) - The text says Nadal scored 76 points on his serve, not Raonic overall.

This translates to ""Nadal won 76 points with his first serve in the match and won 88% of the net points.""  The question asks about how the match progressed *after* the first serve, and 76 points won is the detail provided related to that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic ombovosa kuri 88% umi punto neto-gui** - The text says Nadal won 88% of net points, not Raonic.
*   **C: Osẽkuri 7-2** - This is the final score, but doesn't describe how the match progressed *after* the first serve.

The text states: ""...opoporomarandu inglés ha japonés-pe, omyasãima apopyrã español, italiano ha coreano ta'ãngambyry..."" This translates to ""...it is translated into English and Japanese, with plans to add Spanish, Italian, and Korean subtitles...""

The question asks which language *isn't* currently part of the broadcasts (the three Naked News transmissions). The text implies Spanish, Italian, and Korean are *planned* additions, meaning they aren't currently available.  Since the question asks for a language *not* in the current broadcasts, and the text explicitly lists Italian as a planned addition, Italian is the correct answer.



"
"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, moõpa ndojeguerekomo'ãi umi transmisión pyahu Naked News?","The correct answer is **B: Internet**.

The passage states: ""...internet ha tembiporumỹime g̃uarã."" which translates to ""...through internet and television.""  The question asks *how* the Naked News transmissions are distributed. The passage directly links them to the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tembipurumỹime (Television):** While mentioned alongside the internet, it's not the *sole* method highlighted as the reason for wide distribution.
* **C: Ñoha’ãngakuéra (Viewers):** Viewers are the *audience*, not the method of transmission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 36** - This refers to the number of skiers who completed the first Slalom run.
* **B: 117** - This is the total number of skiers in the Giant Slalom, not the number who didn't finish.
* **C: 4** - This number isn't mentioned in relation to skiers not finishing the Giant Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mokõiha carrera-pe, Carpenado omohu'ã peteĩ esquiador Hungria-gua mboyve** - While Carpenado is mentioned, the text doesn't say they *helped* a Hungarian skier. It states Dani from Hungary advanced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe baloncesto arajere** (The basketball season) - This is what *happened* as a result, not the reason *why* it happened.
* **B: Peteĩ ha’ãhára Utah Jazz-gua** (A Utah Jazz player) - While true, this doesn't explain the *decision* to suspend the season. It's part of the reason, but not the full explanation.
* **D: Pe Tetãgua Baloncesto Aty rehegua Utah Jazz-pegua** (About the National Basketball Association with Utah Jazz) - This is too broad and doesn't pinpoint the cause of the suspension.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** The NBA suspended the season *after* a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19.  It implies this wasn't an isolated case, but rather triggered by multiple positives.
* **Option B** directly reflects this – several players tested positive *during* the Utah Jazz game.  This is the most logical reason for the suspension.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Umi miembro NBA-guápe osẽkuri positivo** (NBA members tested positive) - Too general. The passage specifically links it to the Utah Jazz.
    * **C: Peteĩ ha’ãhára Utah Jazz-gua noha’ãporãikuri osẽ rire chupe positivo** (A Utah Jazz player didn't feel well and then tested positive) - This describes *how* someone tested positive, not *why* the season was suspended.
    * **D: Peteĩ ha’ãhára Utah Jazz-gua osẽkuri chupe positivo** (A Utah Jazz player tested positive) - While true, it doesn't explain the scale of the problem that led to the suspension.

Mávapa omoingera’e gol motenondeha partidope Washington Capitals ohugava’ekue Atlanta Thrashers ndive?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oveschkin asistencia peteĩha ko pyharepe ha'e kuri upe gol motenondeha partidope ojapo vaekue puahu Nicklas Backstrom...""  This translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist in this game was for the game-winning goal scored by Nicklas Backstrom.""

Therefore, Nicklas Backstrom scored the game-winning goal."
Mávapa omoinge gol 60ha peteĩ ára vorépe partido Capitals ohugava’ekue Thrashers ndivépe?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""Ogol mokõiha upe pyharépe ha'ékuri 60-ha upe ára vorépe, ha oiko chugui jugador peteĩha omoingéva 60 térã hetave gol peteĩ ára vorépe 1995-96 guive..."" which translates to ""His second goal of the game was his 60th of the season, and he is the first player to reach 60 or more goals in a season since 1995-96...""

Therefore, Alex Ovechkin was the one who scored his 60th goal in the game against the Thrashers. While Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux are mentioned, they *previously* achieved this feat, not in this specific game.

Araka'épa banco Northern Rock oikotevẽkuri oipytyvõ chupe tetã rekuái?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe banco ohasa rire tetã rekuái poguýpe** (When the bank went into nationalization).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Banco Northern Rock ohasa kuri tetã rekuái poguýpe 2008-pe ojeikuaa rire upe empresa-pe oguahẽhague pytyvõ pya’erãra Reino Unido retãgui.""  This directly translates to ""Northern Rock bank went into nationalization in 2008 after being seen as needing urgent help from the United Kingdom government.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe banco ojeívokuri pe empresa de gestión de activa-gui** (The bank was transferred to the asset management company) - This happened *after* the nationalization, as a result of it.
* **C: Virgin Group ojogua rire pe banco** (When Virgin Group took over the bank) - Virgin attempted to take over, but ultimately didn't fully succeed in preventing nationalization.
* **D: Pe crisis de las hipotecas aja** (The subprime mortgage crisis) - This was the *cause* of the bank's troubles, not the reason it needed a bailout.

El texto indica que Virgin Group intentó comprar el banco antes de que fuera nacionalizado (lo que significa que el gobierno lo ""salvara"").  Aunque finalmente no lo logró, esa fue su oferta principal.

Las otras opciones son incorrectas porque:

* **A:** El texto dice que Virgin *no* se quedó con la empresa que gestionaba los activos (Northern Rock Asset Management).
* **B:** Si bien es cierto que Virgin se involucró después de la nacionalización, la oferta inicial fue *antes*.
* **C:** La ayuda de Virgin fue un intento de compra, no simplemente una ayuda durante la crisis.

"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, mba'e tetãpa ojeafectáva oñemboheraguapývo pe arapytu ñe'ẽme'ẽ Kioto-pegua?","The correct answer is **A: Estados Unidos**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Karai Rudd omboheraguapývo Kioto arapytu ñe'ẽme'ẽ oheja ha'eño Estados Unidos-pe, ha'étava ko'ág̃a ha'eñoite tetã kakuaa nomoneĩriva pe ñe'ẽme'ẽ.""  This translates to: ""Mr. Rudd opposed the Kyoto protocol speech going to the United States, and at that time, no recognized country supported the speech.""  This clearly indicates the United States was the country affected by the opposition to the Kyoto protocol speech.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: India** - The passage states India *did* join the agreement, although with reservations.
* **C: Australia** - The passage mentions Australia opposing the protocol *because* of its impact on industries, but not opposing the speech itself going to the US.
* **D: China** - The passage also states China joined the agreement with reservations.



"
Australia-gua Sãmbyhyhakue oimo'ã pe ratificación Kioto-pegua ombyaineha  mba'épe?,"The correct answer is **B: Tetã virupurukuaa** (Developed countries).

Therefore, Australia opposed the Kyoto Protocol because it placed burdens on *developed countries*.

Australia-gua tirador ñoa'ãngatupegua caza apopyrãmegua.""  This directly translates to ""Mick O'Flynn...the shooters are being trained for a single purpose, being instructed on safety and handling. **Australia-gua tirador ñoa'ãngatupegua caza apopyrãmegua**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pe Apopyrã Australia-gua tirador ñoa'ãngatupegua** - This is part of the full name, but doesn't represent the entire purpose of the instruction.
*   **B: Pe Apopyrã Conservación ha Parque-kuéra Patrimonio rehegua** - This refers to the department Mick O'Flynn works for, not the reason for the training.
*   **C: Pe Apopyrã NPWS rehegua** - NPWS is also the department, not the training's purpose.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""upe oñeñangareko kuri upe tembiapo rehe ha ojehecha oiko porãpa."" This translates to ""they are carrying out the control of the plague with this work and it is being seen if it is working well.""  This implies it's a *first attempt* and they are *observing the results* – meaning no full evaluation has been completed yet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi tirador-pe oñemomarandu kuri jehekombo’e rehe** (The shooters are being trained) - While training *is* happening, it doesn't explain *what isn't known* about the plague control effort.
* **C: Umi tirador rehe ojesarekókuri guardabosque-kuéra** (The rangers are supervising the shooters) - This is a detail of *how* the work is being done, not a lack of information about the control itself.
* **D: Ojeporavo irundy tirador** (Four shooters are being used) - This is a detail about the *implementation* of the control, not about understanding its effectiveness.

"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, moõpa ojejuhu pe división?","The correct answer is **D: Etiopía-pe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “""...Rift Valley Research Service **Etiopía-pegua** jeporekahára ha tembiapo Berhane Asfaw apohára mokõiha” which translates to ""...Berhane Asfaw, a researcher and worker with the Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia**...""  The division (referring to a scientific division or finding) is associated with the research happening *in Ethiopia*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rift Valley-pe:** While the research service is *named* after the Rift Valley, the division itself is located *in* Ethiopia according to the text.
*   **B: Peteĩ fósil-pe:** The fossil is *evidence* used by the division, but isn’t where the division is located.
*   **C: Pe evidencia molecular-pe:** Molecular evidence is also used, but doesn’t represent the location of the division.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...the division carried out by the molecular evidence shows it is older."" This directly indicates that *analysis* of the molecular evidence is what reveals the older age.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe fósil jejuhu (The found fossil):** The fossil itself doesn't *show* the age; it's the analysis of evidence *related* to the fossil (like molecular data) that does.
* **B: Pe división (The division):** ""Division"" is a vague term here. It refers to the division *carried out by* the molecular evidence, not the division itself being the thing that's older.
* **D: Pe tembikuaareka ojejapóva Rift Valley-pe (The research done in Rift Valley):** The research is the *context* for finding the evidence, but it's the analysis of the evidence (molecular data) that establishes the age.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller has two sensors that are placed *in front of the TV* to create a triangular space in three dimensions. This is how the player's movements are tracked and translated into the game.  Therefore, the key to manipulating the game with movement is positioning the sensors on the TV.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ejesareko porã umi sensor controlador reheguápa oñemohenda consola ypýpe** (Adjust well the sensors of the controller connected to the console) - The passage details sensor *placement* not adjustment.
*   **B: Otriangula henda** (Triangulate the position) - Triangulation is the *result* of the sensor placement, not the action the player takes.
*   **D: Emomýi pe controlador yvate rupive** (Move the controller upwards) - The passage explains how the *sensors* work to track movement, not simply moving the controller.



"
Mbaʼépa ojejapova’ekue ojogua hag̃ua pe TVcontrol remoto-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi mokõi sensor controlador rehegua** (The two sensors on the controller).

Here's why:

The text specifically states the game is played ""using a TV remote, the controller *having two sensors* that detect the player's hand movements to create a triangular space in three dimensions.""  This means the sensors are the key element for how the game interacts with the TV remote.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe controlador Nintendo Revolución rehegua** (The Nintendo Revolution controller) - While the concept originated with the Revolution controller, the text states the game is played *using a TV remote*.
* **C: Pe jehechaukarã principal** (The main exhibition) - This refers to the Tokyo Game Show and isn't how the game is played.
* **D: Pe consola Nintendo Revolución rehegua** (The Nintendo Revolution console) -  Similar to B, the game isn't directly played *on* the console, but through the TV remote.

Mba'épa noñemombe'úikuri pe marandu ipahaitegua ome’ẽva’ekue marandu myasãiha rehegua Xinhua-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe avión oguerekoha peteĩ amenaza de bomba** (The plane has a bomb threat).

Here's why:

The question asks what detail is *not* included in the initial report from Xinhua. The initial report states the plane is hijacked and heading towards Afghanistan/Kandahar, and was originally intended to fly to Ürümqi. It *doesn't* initially mention a bomb threat. That detail is revealed in the following sentence (""Marandu ypy he’ipe avión oñembojevyha Afganistan-pe oñembotove rire chupe oguejy pya’e hag̃ua Ürümqi-pe."") which clarifies *why* it's been diverted to Afghanistan.

Therefore, the bomb threat is the piece of information that isn't in the very first report.



"
Mba'épa noñemombe'úikuri pe marandu ypýpe ome’ẽva’ekue marandu myasãiha Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Pe avión oñembotoveha pya’e oguejy hag̃ua Ürümqi-pe.**

Here's why:

The main news (myasãiha) from Xinhua states the plane was hijacked and potentially headed to Kandahar, Afghanistan. However, the *later* report (marandu ypy) specifies the plane was actually *diverted* to Afghanistan after initially attempting to fly to Ürümqi.  This diversion is the new information added in the later report, and thus what isn't included in the initial report.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pe avión oĩha secuestrado** - This *is* mentioned in both the main and later reports.
*   **C: Pe avión oguevi jeyha Afganistán-pe** - This is also mentioned in both.
*   **D: Pe avión oguerekoha peteĩ amenaza de bomba** - This is also present in both reports.

Mba’épa oikuaauka Sara Danius pe radio programa jave?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko comité noñeha’ãvéima oñe’ẽ haguã Bob Dylan ndive** (The committee didn't even try to speak with Bob Dylan).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Danius explained the committee was unable to get in touch with Bob Dylan to notify him of the award, and that they attempted to reach out but failed.  This is the central point of her statement in the radio program.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the prize *is* mentioned, the core of her statement isn't simply *that* Dylan won, but the difficulty in contacting him.
* **B:** The text mentions collaborators and help, but doesn’t focus on a lack of support *within* the committee.
* **C:**  The text doesn't discuss who was nominated, only the winner and the trouble reaching him.



"
Mávandipa ndaikatúikuri oñeñe’ẽ?,"The correct answer is **B: Sara Danius**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee for Literature, publicly revealed in a radio program that the committee had been unable to reach Bob Dylan to inform him of his 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.  She is the one who *couldn't* get in touch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bob Dylan-pe oipytyvõva ag̃uĩ guive:** This translates to ""Bob Dylan- to help him.""  Dylan is the *recipient* of the prize, not the reason contact was impossible.
* **C: Pe Academia Sueca-pe:** This translates to ""The Swedish Academy."" While the Academy is involved, the passage specifically highlights Danius's struggle.
* **D: Bob Dylan:** Dylan is the one *being* contacted, not the one preventing contact.



"
Mávapa he’iva’ekue pe ñe'ẽme'ẽ ha'eha “peteĩ paso tuichava”?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bush vocero Gordon Johndroe ohero kuri Corea Yvate gotyogua ñe'ẽme'ẽ..."" This directly translates to ""Bush spokesperson Gordon Johndroe said regarding North Korea's statement...""  Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who *said* the phrase ""peteĩ paso tuichava"" (a big step).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Momaranduha (Information):** This is a general term, not a person who would make a statement.
*   **B: George W Bush:** While Johndroe is *Bush's* spokesperson, the text specifically attributes the quote to Johndroe.
*   **D: Peteĩ Corea Yvate gotyogua momaranduhára (A North Korean official):** The text says Johndroe is *reporting on* what North Korea said, not *being* North Korean.

The text states: ""Ha'e ojapo 1.000 ári ta'ãngajopyrã Suecia ha ambue 28 tetãme g̃uarã."" which translates to ""He made 1,000 banknotes for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Therefore, Słania made 1,000 banknotes for many countries."

The passage states: ""Ararundy ka'arúpe, yryrurãguasu pytuho rupi oñehẽ gueteri, oĩméne takukue omyasãihaguére yryrurãguasu ryepýpe.""  This translates to: ""In the event of a disruption, it flows through the pipeline, with a cushion being created in the pipeline.""

The passage explains the cushion is there to absorb shock and prevent damage in case of disruptions to the flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe jejokoha renda yryrurãguýpe oñemyenyhẽ ikatuha peve** (The location is changed in the pipeline) - This is not mentioned as a reason for the cushion.
* **B: Peteĩ mba'era'ã jepiguáva rire tatarendy jeporavorape reheguávape** (After a disruption to the transport) - This describes *when* the cushion is useful, not *why* it exists.
* **D: Peteĩ tatarendyguasu peteĩva mba'enohẽha pytaha Fort Greely-peguápe** (A large transport installation at Fort Greely) -  This is a detail about the pipeline but doesn't explain the purpose of the cushion.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ararundy ka'arúpe, yryrurãguasu pytuho rupi oñehẽ gueteri, oĩméne takukue omyasãihaguére yryrurãguasu ryepýpe."" This directly translates to ""In the event of a spill, it would be released into the river, where it would help cool the bottom of the river.""  This explains the purpose of the released oil - to cool the riverbed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The mention of a road and a survey relates to the pipeline's construction, not *why* the oil is released.
* **C:**  The text doesn't state the rivers *cause* the releases; the oil is released *into* them.
* **D:** The text says additional sites could hold 104,500 spills, it doesn't say the current site *cannot* hold enough.

"Ko'ag̃aitéramo, mboýpiko pe y ijyvatekue pe Ninth Ward-pe?","The correct answer is **A: 6 m**.

Here's why:

The question asks for the highest the water reached in the Ninth Ward. The text states: ""Upe Ninth Ward, ohecha vaekue upe y japyhy ohupyty vaekue 6 m upe Huracan Katrina jave..."" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, you can see the water reached 6 m during Hurricane Katrina...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 150 mm** - This is the amount the engineer is proposing to raise the dike, not the water level.
* **C: Ku’a alturape** - This translates to ""its height"" and is vague. The text doesn't tell us the current height of the dike.
* **D: 300 m** - This is the length of a section of the dike, not the water level.



"
"Pe Huracán Katrina jave, mba’épa oikókuri Ninth Ward-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Umi y ojupiva’ekue ijyvatékuri 6 m** (The water rose to 6 m in the Ninth Ward).

The text explicitly states: ""Upe Ninth Ward, ohecha vaekue upe y japyhy ohupyty vaekue 6 m upe Huracan Katrina jave"" which translates to ""The Ninth Ward, you can see the water rose 6 m during Hurricane Katrina.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umi y ojupiva’ekue ipekue oguerekókuri 300 m** (The water rose to a length of 300 m) - This refers to the length of a section of the dike, not the water level.
*   **B: Pe y ku’a peve ijyvatekuéva ohasapákuri pe dique** (The water that rose the highest passed over the dike) - The text doesn't state the highest water level passed *over* the dike.
*   **D: 150 mm amangýre oitýkuri pe dique oñembyaíva** (150 mm is the length that the dike will be raised) - This refers to the planned height increase of the dike, not what happened during Katrina.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui nomoañetéikuri Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **A: Moõpa ohova’ekue pe hasýva** (How serious the illness is).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the seriousness of the Ebola virus outbreak in Nigeria and the potential for it to spread.** Hamilton is concerned about the outbreak *because* of how severe the illness is.  The passage mentions the need for infection control measures *because* the virus is dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe probabilidad oĩva ambue hasýva ikatuha ojapyhy pe virus** (The probability that another illness could contract the virus) - The passage doesn't discuss other illnesses contracting Ebola, it's about containing the existing outbreak.
* **C: Ojejapópakuri umi oñeikotevẽva ñeñangarekorã** (The infection control measures are being implemented) - This is *a result* of Hamilton's concern, not the concern itself. The passage states the hospital is taking precautions *because* of the risk.
* **D: Pe hasýva mba’échaitépa oĩ ko'ágãitéramo** (How many cases there are right now) - While there are cases, the passage doesn't specifically focus on the *number* of cases, but rather the nature of the illness itself.

This directly translates to: ""Scientists are investigating how planets are made, and **how the sun remains**, comets hitting the sun.""  The question asks what scientists are investigating, and this sentence clearly states they are investigating the sun's existence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi cometa ombetírõguare arapy rehe** (How comets hit the sun) - While comets hitting the sun *are* mentioned, it's as context *to* the investigation, not the investigation itself.
* **B: Mba’éichapa heñói proteína-kuéra** (How proteins are formed) - The passage mentions proteins being *in* organic matter, but doesn't say scientists are investigating how they are formed.

The passage states: ""...80 policía oĩ kuri ombohape haguã umi mba'yrumýi omboguatávape desvio-kuéra rehe.""  This directly translates to ""80 police are there to control the people who are protesting the detours.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojerure hikuái FBI-pe ohapemboty hag̃ua** - The passage says the Maryland Transportation Secretary *contacted* the FBI, not that the police are reporting *to* the FBI for the operation itself.
* **B: Odecidi hikuái ojapo jehapemboty** - The passage doesn't mention the police deciding to do the operation; they are *participating* in it.
* **D: Omombe'u hikuái jeiko mbegueve tráfico ipohýirupi upe ambue tape ojeiporúva pukukue** - While they might be directing traffic, the primary role stated is controlling protestors related to the detours.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ojeiporu kuri volteo camión-kuéra **ohapembopy haguã tubo-kuéra jeikeha**...""  This directly translates to ""Volteo trucks are being used **to prepare the tubes**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the photographer *caused* an accident on Sepulveda Boulevard, the text doesn't say this is what prevented them from being charged.
* **C:** The photographer *tried* to go around a police stop, but this isn't the reason they weren't charged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha’e noñeñanduporãi** (He doesn't care) - The text doesn't mention anything about the president's feelings or lack of concern.
* **B: Ijahy’o rasy** (He is tired) - While the text mentions tiredness (""akãnundu""), it doesn’t directly relate to the *condition* of being positive for the virus.
* **D: iñakãnundu** (He is tired) - Again, tiredness is mentioned, but it doesn’t define his condition related to the virus itself.

"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, mávapa añetegua ko'ã mba'e oje'éva presidente rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Ha'e oĩporã omba’apo hag̃ua mombyry guive** (He is well and willing to continue working despite everything).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Presidente oĩporã, jepéramo upeícha opytáta oñemoha’eño hóga ko’ã ára oúvape"" which translates to ""The president is well, even though they are still quarantined these days.""
* The question asks what the text says about the president's condition. Option C directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naiñakãnundúi** (I don't understand) - This is a statement of comprehension, not information *from* the text.
* **B: Opytáta hógape heta arapokõindy pukukue** (He is quarantined at home for many anxious days) - While true, it doesn't answer what the text says about his *condition* – it describes his situation.
* **D: Ojagarra vai chupe pe virus** (The virus attacked him) - The text states he *tested positive* for the virus, but doesn't say it ""attacked"" him in that phrasing. More importantly, it focuses on his current wellbeing *despite* the positive test.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka'épa oñeha'ãrõkuri pe Yvytuvai Yvyjopepygua Gonu ikãngyve ohóvo?","The correct answer is **B: Oguejy jave yvytu 83 kilómetro peteĩ aravópe rupi** (It is currently moving at 83 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko árape pyharevete, yvytu oho 83 kilómetro aravóre rupi ha oñeha'ãrõ ikãngyve ohóvo.""  This directly translates to ""Currently, the storm is moving at 83 kilometers per hour and is expected to intensify.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Og̃uahẽ mboyve Maldivas-pe** (It is approaching the Maldives) - While the passage mentions the Maldives, it doesn't say the storm *is approaching* them currently, just that its name is in the Maldivian language.
* **C: Og̃uahẽ mboyve ijyvatevehápe** (It is approaching the east) - The passage doesn't give any directional information about where the storm is heading.
* **D: Og̃uahẽ mboyve yvytu 149 millas aravóre** (It is moving at 149 miles per hour) - The passage states the *maximum sustained wind speed* is equivalent to 149 miles per hour, not the speed of movement.  The current speed is 83 kilometers per hour.



"
Mba'éichapa ipya'ékuri umi yvytu og̃uahẽvo imbaretevehápe pe Yvytuvai Yvyjopepygua Gonu-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilómetro aravóre**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ohupyty yvytu ohóva 240 kilómetro aravóre (149 milla aravóre)."" This directly answers the question of how far the storms travel to reach the Yvytuvai Yvyjopepygua Gonu – 149 kilometers.  While 240 kilometers is mentioned, it's given *as a conversion* to miles, not the direct distance to the Gonu.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui noñeconsiderái peteĩ rasgo Karenia brevis reheguáva?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikatu omonge tajygue yvypóra** (It can poison people).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ygau oguereko peteĩ mba'e tajygue oporombohasýva ikatúva omonge tajygue yvypóra ha pirápe."" (The algae has a substance that can poison people and fish.) This directly describes *Karenia brevis* being poisonous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha'e peteĩchagua ygáu** (It is a type of algae): The passage explicitly states it's an algae (""oiko Karenia brevis"").
* **C: Heta célula oguerekóva** (It is made up of many cells): The passage says ""oĩ peteĩ célula añónte oguerekóva"" (it's a single-celled organism), not many cells.
* **D: Oikóva teko harupi** (It lives in the environment): The passage states ""oikóva tekoha rupi"" (lives in the environment), so this *is* a characteristic.

**Therefore, the only statement that isn't a characteristic of *Karenia brevis* as described in the passage is that it can poison people – it IS poisonous, making B the incorrect answer, and the only one that doesn’t fit.**



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaikatúi ojapo Karena brevis?,"The correct answer is **D: Ojapo peteĩ mba'e tajygue oporombohasýva** (It creates a certain poisonous substance).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ygau oguereko peteĩ mba'e tajygue oporombohasýva ikatúva omonge tajygue yvypóra ha pirápe."" (The bloom contains a poisonous substance that can harm humans and fish.)  This directly links *Karenia brevis* to *producing* a toxin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Omonge tajygue pirakuérape** (It harms fish) - While true, this is a *result* of what *Karenia brevis* does, not *what it is*.
* **B: Pya’e oñembohetave ipapapýpe ojejuhúvo oimeraẽ condición-pe** (What is needed to create a favorable condition in the paper) - This is completely unrelated to the text.
* **C: Ombyai pe y** (It emits the 'y') - This is nonsensical and not mentioned in the passage.

"He’ihaicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼãva apytégui ndoikói pe huracán Felicia rupi?","The correct answer is **C: Aratiri akói**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pe amáme omoirũ tormenta eléctrica ha **aratiri akói**."" (And with it came electrical storms and **heavy rain**.)

The question asks what, according to the passage, accompanies the hurricane Felicia.  Heavy rain is directly stated as being part of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ama ouporãva** (It's not strong) - The passage states it *was* a category 4 hurricane, so this is incorrect.
*   **B: Ama arasunu reheve** (It's not about the wind) - The passage doesn’t say it’s *not* about the wind. It talks about rain and electrical storms.
*   **D: Tapekuéra oñapymíva** (People being injured) - The passage says there's no *report* of injuries or deaths, but doesn't state it as a direct accompaniment.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Felicia, peteĩ jey tormenta de categoría 4 escala de huracanes Saffir-Simpson-pe, ikangy ohóvo oguahẽ meve depresión tropical-pe opaite mboyve ko araapýpe."" (Felicia, once a category 4 hurricane, has weakened into a tropical depression today.) This directly addresses the change in the hurricane's status.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe ama oúva upévagui oipytyvõ Oahu-pe** (The rain helped Oahu) - While the rain is mentioned, the passage doesn't state it was *helpful*. It only notes the amount of rainfall.
* **C: Oky opavave umi isla-pe** (It passed over all the islands) - The passage says it *passed near* the islands (""Hembyre rupive oky opave nunga umi isla-pe""), but doesn't say it went *over* them all.
* **D: Umi amáme omoirũ aratiri** (The rain brought thunderstorms) - This is a detail *about* the storm, not a statement about the storm's change in status.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Piquet Jr. Oñemosẽ kuri upe Grand Prix Hungaria 2009 pegua rire."" (Piquet Jr. left after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso ochoka kuri** - Alonso is mentioned in relation to a different race (Singapore 2008).
* **B: Piquet Jr oñemotenondékuri** -  The text says he was *investigated* due to Alonso's actions, but doesn't state he was investigated *because* he left the Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **D: Pe mba'yru segurida regua oĩkuri peteĩ ojechokahápe** - This is about the safety car situation in Singapore 2008, not the reason Piquet Jr. left in 2009.



"

The text states: ""Piquet Jr. ochoka kuri upe Grand Prix Singapur 2008pe, jepyta voi boxespe riremi Fernando Alonso ojapova..."" which translates to ""Piquet Jr. crashed in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, just after Fernando Alonso left the pits..."" This clearly indicates the crash happened *after* Alonso exited the pits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi ambue mba'yru omoĩ aja nafta:** While this happens *because* of the crash, it doesn't describe *when* the crash happened.
* **C: Osẽ mboyve pe mba'yru segurida regua:**  The safety car came out *as a result* of the crash, not the other way around.
* **D: Piquet oike rire nafta piári:** This isn't what the text says. Piquet crashed after Alonso left the pits.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on a study *about* the evolution of a species.** It details how researchers are observing the changes in a finch population over generations. The core of the text is the *research* itself, not just the fact that a new species is evolving, or that all species evolve, or that a species already exists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe especie pyahu ñemoheñói** (The evolution of the species) - While evolution *is* happening, the text is about the *study* of that evolution, not the evolution itself.
* **C: Ñemoheñói opaichagua especie apytépe** (The evolution of all species) - The passage is specifically about *one* species, not all species.
* **D: Ñemoheñói orekóva pe especie** (The existing evolution of the species) -  The study is observing *current* evolution, but the focus isn't on past evolution; it's on observing it as it happens.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *how* a new species is forming (hybridization between two finch species) and connects it to Darwin's finches and the concept of evolution.** The researchers are studying the *process* by which evolution is happening.
* **A: Moõpa heñói pe especie pyahu** (How the new species is born) - While related, the passage isn't just about *that* the species is born, but *how* it's happening evolutionarily.
* **C: Pe especie pyahu réra** (The name of the new species) - The name (""Kuri"") is mentioned, but it's not the main focus of the study.
* **D: Umi guyra oikeva’ekue pe ñemoheñóime** (The birds involved in the experiment) -  The birds are the subjects, but the *process* of their hybridization and the resulting evolution is what the research is about.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""peteĩha Europa yvy ha kuarahy resẽ gotyoguápe oguerekótava CowParade"" which translates to ""the first to have CowParade in Europe and the world.""
* **The text also mentions:** it's in Bucarest (Romania) but implies it's not *exclusive* to Bucarest.
* **""Heta tavusu Europa-peguápe""** means ""in many cities in Europe,"" which aligns with being the first in Europe and the world, suggesting it's been in multiple locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Heta tavusu Rumania-peguápe:** While it started in Bucharest, Romania, the text indicates it's wider than just Romania.
* **B: Bucarest Tavarógape:**  Too specific.  It's *in* Bucharest, but not *only* in Bucharest.
* **C: Opavave Europa yvy ha kuarahy resẽ gotyoguápe:**  ""All of Europe and the world"" is too broad. The text says it was the *first* to have it, not that it's *everywhere* now.

This translates to ""it was the first in Europe and worldwide to have CowParade, a very beautiful artistic event that takes place in the spring and early summer this year.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiko umi tavusu ojeheróva “creativapente”** - The text doesn't mention ""creativapente"".
* **B: Omoakã Bucarest Tavaróga** - While the text mentions Bucharest, it's not *about* the city itself, but the event happening there.
* **D: Ha'e pe mba'eporã'apo avaetagua rehegua tuichavéva ko yvy ape ári** - While true, it's not the *main* point the text is trying to convey about CowParade. Option C is more comprehensive.

The text states: ""Rusia omboyvyguejy sapy'aite umi Il-76 upe mba'e'andýi rire."" This translates to ""Russia is investigating all the Il-76s after the incident.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi milíko tetãpygua** (The national militaries) - While national militaries *use* the Il-76, that's not *why* Russia is investigating them.
* **C: Pe Soviético milíko atygua** (The Soviet military history) - The history of the plane isn't the reason for the investigation.
* **D: Peteĩ ñeporandu noñemboguyguýiva gueteri** (A non-investigated investigation) - The text actually states an investigation *is* happening.



"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Upe Il-76 ha'eva'ekue mba'e Rusia ha Soviético milíko atygua oñemomba'eguasúva"" which translates to ""The Il-76 is a Russian and Soviet military aircraft.""  It further describes it as an airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ submarino** (A submarine) - The text doesn't mention submarines.
*   **B: Peteĩ tanque** (A tank) - The text doesn't mention tanks.
*   **D: Peteĩ tren** (A train) - The text doesn't mention trains.

This translates to ""In 1989, he helped Brooks and Groening with the creation of The Simpsons, and then began working as a program scriptwriter.""  Therefore, Simon was the one who started as a scriptwriter.

"Fluke heʼiháicha, mávapa omondo chupe hetaiterei temiandu porã ha ñemokyre'ỹ?","The correct answer is **D: Umi kuimba’e ha kuña**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that ""kuimba'e ha kuña omondohaguére chupe hetaiterei temiandu porã ha ñemokyre'ỹ"" – meaning ""men and women offer him a lot of good advice and support"".  The question (Q) directly asks *who* offers Fluke the advice and support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pohãnoharakuéra (Sorcerers/Witches)** - The passage mentions them *receiving* the advice to help the women, not *giving* it to Fluke.
* **B: Kuñanguéra tesãirã rehe omba'apóva (Women working on their exit)** - These are the women Fluke is trying to help, not those helping *him*.
* **C: Kuimba’ekuéra (Men)** - While men are included, the passage specifically states *both* men and women.

"Pe pehẽnguépe heʼiháicha, mbaʼe rehépa ndojeipotaiva’ekue kuñanguéra oñeʼẽ?","The correct answer is **C: Kuñanguéra tesãirã rehe** (About women being pregnant).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** The person (Fluke) is trying to prevent women from talking about their pregnancies, especially early on. The whole scheme revolves around keeping pregnancies secret.
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is the reason women are not allowed to talk?

Therefore, the answer is about the topic they are prohibited from discussing: their pregnancies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuimba’ekuérare** (About men) - The passage focuses on controlling *women's* speech, not men's.
* **B: Umi ojehepyme’ẽva ñepohãnorã rehe** (About those who give advice on pregnancy) - While advice is involved, the core issue is the *disclosure* of pregnancy, not the advice itself.

The text states: ""...oĩ peteĩ cuerpo planetario añoite ohechaukáva hetave mba’e ku’e Titán-gui, ha héra hína **Yvy**.”  This directly translates to ""...there is a planetary body that shows many things like it on Titan, and its name is **Earth**.""

Therefore, the planetary body observed with many similarities to Titan is Yvy (Earth)."
Mba'e cuerpo planetario-pepa ojehechakuaa umi ysyry ha ypa oguerekóva peteĩ y hesakãva?,"The correct answer is **B: Titán**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...oĩ peteĩ cuerpo planetario añoite ohechaukáva hetave mba’e ku’e Titán-gui..."" which translates to ""...there is a planetary body where many things like those of Titan have been observed...""  The question (Q) asks where rivers and lakes with a liquid have been observed. The passage directly links these observations to Titan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Júpiter:** While Jupiter has moons, the passage doesn't mention Jupiter in relation to rivers or lakes.
*   **C: Kuarahy (Sun):** The sun is a star, not a planetary body with rivers or lakes.
*   **D: Saturno (Saturn):** While Saturn is the planet Titan orbits, the passage specifically states the *observations* are similar to what's seen *on* Titan, not Saturn itself.

Mba'épa ko'ã mba'e ojetopáva ndaha'éiva osẽva pe tague jejuhúgui?,"The correct answer is **C: Marandu guyrarague evolución rehegua** (Research on the evolution of feathers).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on the evolutionary development of feathers.** It discusses how feathers might have originated in dinosaurs, their color (carotenoid pigments), and how they weren't initially for flight but for other purposes like display or thermoregulation.  The mention of the ""raquis"" and how it's a developed structure supports this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mymba rague sa’y (Feather color):** While color is *mentioned*, it's only a part of the broader discussion about feather evolution.
* **B: Peteĩ ñeikũmby umi tague ndojeporuihague ojeveve jave (A theory about how feathers didn't initially develop for flying):** This is *a* point made in the passage, but it’s not the central theme.
* **D: Ñemo'añete heta umi dinosaurio orekohague tague (Research on many dinosaurs with feathers):** The passage focuses on *understanding* the evolution of feathers, not simply cataloging dinosaurs that have them.



"
Mba’épa ndorekoiva’ekue umi dinosaurio rague?,"The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ raquis**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Upéva hína pe dinosaurio rague ndoguerekói rehe peteĩ mbytegua ojedesarrolla porãva, hérava raquis, katu hague heko ambue - mba'e akua ha pe pira kangue joguaha...""  This translates to: ""This refers to the fact that dinosaur wings did not have a well-developed structure called a raquis, but rather a different structure - something like a bone and a feather shaft...""

Therefore, the text explicitly states dinosaurs *didn't* have a raquis in their wings, making it a defining characteristic they lacked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pira kangue joguaha** (feather shaft) - The text mentions this *with* the raquis, not as something they lacked.
*   **C: Guyrarague okakuaapava** (wings that understand) - This is a metaphorical interpretation and not a physical characteristic they lacked.
*   **D: Sa'yjuguy yvygotyo** (colorful carotenoids) - The text says they *had* this, it wasn't something they were missing.

This directly translates to ""In the PALM trial, Zmapp is used as a control, meaning the scientists use it as a baseline and compare it to other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojejapo anticuerpo-gui** (It's made of antibodies) - While true, the passage focuses on its *use* in the trial, not its composition.
* **B: Ha'e oipohanokuaa umi infección ha katu ndaikatúi ojoko ñemano** (It recognizes infections but cannot cause illness) -  The passage says it *may* work against Ebola, but doesn't definitively state it can't cause illness.  It's still experimental.
* **D: Jeitypeka porãve ohechauka kuri oguerekoha sa'ive mba'e porã oñeha'ãrovaekuegui** (It shows promise in having good results with effort) - This is a general statement that’s implied, but not the *primary* point the passage makes about Zmapp.

This translates to: ""In the PALM trial, Zmapp is used as a control, meaning the scientists use it as a baseline and compare other three treatments to it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions seeking better treatments, it doesn't say *this* is what the trial aims to demonstrate. It focuses on *comparing* treatments.
* **C:**  Zmapp is used *with* the baseline, not *as* the baseline.  The baseline is established *using* Zmapp.
* **D:** The passage doesn't make a general claim about improving conditions; it’s about evaluating different treatments for Ebola.

Here's why:

The text states the chip is important because it can help diagnose cancer early, HIV, and malaria ""umi tapicha hasyva oikova ambue tetã sa'i pirapire oguerekova"" – *people who live in small countries with few resources*.  The investigators believe it will especially help in countries where early cancer detection is difficult due to lack of resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tetãnguéra sa’ive ipirapirévape** (Small resource countries) - While it *helps* these countries, the text focuses on the impact on *many* resource-limited countries, not just small ones.
* **C: Estados Unidos-pe** (In the United States) - The chip was *developed* at Stanford, but the benefit is explicitly stated to be for other countries.
* **D: Mbo’ehaopavẽ Stanford-pe** (At Stanford University) - Again, Stanford is where it was created, but the importance lies in its global application.



"

Here's why:

The text specifically states the chip costs ""kuaáva 1 centavo pe dolar americanore"" – meaning it costs 1 cent US dollar. The question asks *what* is used to make the diagnostic tool affordable, and the answer is its incredibly low cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umi impresora inyección de tinta estándar rehegua** (Standard inkjet printers) - While the chip *can be printed* with an inkjet printer, the printer isn't the cost-saving factor.
*   **C: Umi ficha oñembokuatiáva rehegua** (The chips themselves) - This is what is *being* made, not what makes it affordable.
*   **D: Ambue tembipuru diagnóstico rehegua** (Other diagnostic tools) - The text is comparing this *to* other diagnostic tools, not using them in its creation.

* **The question asks:** What does the passage *not* say about the lobular scarps?
* **Option B directly contradicts the passage's claim.** The passage *does* say there's no geological activity on Mars, therefore it doesn't say that activity *does* exist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiméne nda’aréi oikohague umi mba’e omoheñóiva’ekue chupekuéra:**  (It's not known what caused them) - The passage doesn't discuss *what* caused the scarps, only a theory about whether geological activity is involved.

* **The question asks:** What theory explains these geographical accidents as evidence of geological activity in the past?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jasy michĩve rupi ohóvo ko'ẽreíre** (Through the thickness of the earth to the center) - This describes *where* the features are found, not the theory about *why* they exist.
* **B: Umi accidente geográfico ymaite guive ojejapo** (These geographical accidents were made a long time ago) - This is a statement about the *age* of the features, not a theory explaining their formation.
* **D: Umi accidente geográfico ramoite guare** (These geographical accidents are rare) - This refers to the rarity of the features, not the theory about their origin.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer as it directly addresses the presence of these ancient geographical accidents as supporting evidence for past geological activity."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'épa ndojeikuaaukamo'ãvéima acusación peve?","The correct answer is **A: Ndojeikuaaukamo'ãvéima temiandu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Corona-pegua oficina, omotenondéva enjuiciamiento-kuéra, he'i kuri periodista-kuérape **ndojeikuaukamo'ãveimaha temiandu ágã acusación peve**.""  This directly translates to ""The Corona office, responsible for the trials, told journalists **not to reveal any information about the accusation**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi taʼãnga jeikuaauka:** This refers to the ways information *could* be leaked, not what is being restricted.
* **C: Ñomongeta oĩmeraẽ tapicha ohecha va'ekue ndivegua:** This talks about people watching and potentially contaminating the case, a different issue.
* **D: Umi kuatiahaipyre ñemyasãi:**  This refers to published articles, not the instruction to journalists.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'épa ndaha'éi apañuái ko'ág̃a umi sellador-pe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **B: Pe yrypy’a hetakue** (The size of the seal).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pittman he'iháicha, yrypy'a retakue ha anambusukue ha'e mba'e ivaivéva umi foca omymbajukávape g̃uarã 15 ary ohasávape.""  This translates to: ""Pittman says that the size and thickness of the seal are what last for 15 years when seals are applied.""

The question asks what *isn't* applied to the seals.  The passage specifically mentions size and thickness *are* applied. Therefore, the answer must be something *not* applied.  The other options are either related to the application process (A) or qualities *of* the seal (C & D), but the question is what isn't *applied* to the seals themselves.

Therefore, **B** is the best answer because the passage focuses on the size of the seal as a critical factor for longevity."
"Pe yrypy’a ári, mba’e ambue mba’e oafectáva pyrysõ ñepia'ã?","The correct answer is **D: Umi foca**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pittman he'iháicha, yrypy'a retakue ha anambusukue ha'e mba'e ivaivéva umi foca omymbajukávape g̃uarã 15 ary ohasávape."" This translates to ""Pittman says the seal's (yrypy'a) health and well-being depend on the seals that attacked it 15 days ago.""

Therefore, the other seals (umi foca) are directly affecting the injured seal's recovery (pyrysõ ñepia'ã).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndaipóri mba'evéichagua tekotevẽmby:** This means ""There is nothing that needs to be considered,"" which is false as the passage clearly states something *is* affecting recovery.
*   **B: Arapytu rehegua:** This means ""Related to the weather,"" and the passage doesn't connect weather to the seal's recovery.
*   **C: Tekotevẽ pytyvõ:** This means ""Need help,"" while the seal might need help, the passage doesn’t state that another factor affects its recovery.



"
Mba’e jerovia piko Roberts ombotovete?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe ética oñeñe’ẽvo umi káso rehe** (The ethics of speaking about the cases).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""he'i kuri ndaha'emo'ái etico oñe'ẽro mobosa'i kuerare umi káso ndaha'éva añetegua"" - meaning he said it wasn't ethical to speak about cases that weren't analogous. This is the core of what he believed about the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemomba'eguasuva'erã Tekojojaro Rusu apopyrã ijojáva** (The consequences of the Russian government's appointment) - While mentioned, this is a *result* of Roe vs. Wade, not what Roberts primarily believed.
* **C: Tekove ñepyrũ** (The beginning of life) - This is a topic related to the debate, but not Roberts' specific objection as stated in the passage.
* **D: Tekokatu ha'éva ñemi rehegua** (The lawsuit about it) - This is about a potential lawsuit related to Roe, not Roberts' core ethical concern.



"
Mba’e témapa Roberts he'i ndaha’emo'ãiha etico oñeñe’ẽ hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **D: Umi mba’e específico umi káso rehegua**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts said it wasn't ethical to talk about ""specific cases that weren't analogous."" This directly corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe Tekojojaro Rusu apopyrã ijojáva (The Russian government's interference):** While mentioned in the context of how Roe v. Wade was argued, it's *not* what Roberts said was unethical to discuss.
* **B: Pe decisión Roe v Wade rehegua (The decision regarding Roe v Wade):**  Roberts discussed Roe v. Wade itself (""yvy léi oñemohendáva""), so it wasn't the topic he deemed unethical.
* **C: Tekokatu oje'e'ỹva ha'éva ñemi rehegua (The lawsuit filed against him):** This is mentioned, but not the core of what Roberts considered an ethical boundary in discussion.



"
Moõpa omimbi umi araveraichagua hendýva?,"The correct answer is **A: Ára gotyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mokõi araveraichagua hendyva ojupy ára gotyo upe pyhare mbytepe.""  This translates to ""Two witnesses support the date of the event.""  Therefore, the witnesses support *the date* (ára gotyo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Táva tuichakue javeve:** The passage mentions the city, but the witnesses don't support *the city*.
* **C: Pe peteĩha temimo'ã syrýpe:**  The passage talks about the first impact, but the witnesses aren't specifically supporting *that impact*.
* **D: Pe yvyraty mandu’arã mbytépe:** The passage mentions the forest fire, but again, the witnesses aren’t supporting *the fire* itself.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka'épa oñemopu'ãta rascacielos pyahu upe tendápe?","The correct answer is **A: Ára mbytépe**.

The passage states: ""...ohorei hina hese oñemopu'ãvo po yvaga karãiha upe tendape, oguerekotava peteĩ centro mba'yru kuerape guara ha peteĩ yvyraty mandu'arã.""  This translates to ""...when they finally built the skyscraper on that land, it had a shopping center around it and a surrounding park.""  The phrase ""ohorei hina hese oñemopu'ãvo"" means ""when they finally built"" or ""when it was built,"" referring to the time *after* the event described earlier – the two days leading up to the event.  Therefore, the skyscraper was built *after* the mentioned date.  ""Ára mbytépe"" means ""later"" or ""afterwards.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pyhareve 8:46 aravo jave** - This is the specific time of the initial event, not when the skyscraper was built.
* **C: Pyhare pukukue** - This means ""the next day,"" not the time of construction.
* **D: Oñemotenonde mba’e ñemopu’ã** - This means ""they don't know what they are building,"" which isn't what the passage states.



"
Mbaʼe marandúpa ohechauka umi Pokõi Kypy'y haʼeha itakua?,"The correct answer is **A: Arapytu ñemoambue** (Temperature variations).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ta'ãnga infrarrojo ohechauka arapytu ñemoambue pyharekue ha pyharevekue, upéva he'ise ha'eha itakua."" which translates to ""Infrared imaging shows the temperature differences between hot and cold, which indicates where the craters are.""  

Therefore, temperature variations are what identify the ""Pokõi Kypy'y"" (craters) as craters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi itakua jeikeha diámetro** (The diameter of the craters) - While the passage *mentions* the size of the craters (100-250 meters), it doesn't say this is *how* they are identified.
* **C: Umi tembikuaareka geología rehegua** (Geological formations) - The passage doesn't focus on the geological formations themselves, but on identifying craters *using* temperature.
* **D: Ta'ãngakuéra itakua rehegua oĩva yvýpe** (Stories about craters on Earth) - The passage is about identifying craters, not folklore about them.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ta'ãnga infrarrojo ohechauka arapytu ñemoambue pyharekue ha pyharevekue, upéva he'ise ha'eha itakua.""  This translates to ""Infrared imaging reveals the temperature differences between hot and cold areas, which indicates the location of the craters.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuára pypuku rupive** - While the text mentions ""kuára pypuku"" (dust), it says they *are found on* the craters, not *how* the craters are detected.
* **C: Umi itakua diámetro rupive** - The text mentions the size (100-250 meters) but doesn't state that's *how* they are detected.
* **D: Umi porandu’aty ojejapóva umi itakua oĩva ko yvýpe rehegua rupive** - The text doesn't discuss research being done *on* the craters, just how they are identified.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the accused person is *allegedly* doing.** The text states ""Pe tapicha oje’eha ombokapuha explosivo oĩ detenido"" which translates to ""The people are accused of carrying an explosive and are detained.""  This is the direct accusation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiporu peteĩ mba'yrumýi explosión aja** (They carried out an explosion) - The text says they were *accused* before an explosion happened, and were injured *by* an explosion, not that they carried it out.
* **C: Mburuvichakuéra oikuaa mba’e etnia-guápa** (Authorities know what ethnicity they are) -  The text states authorities *don't* know their names but *suspect* they are Uighur. This isn't the accusation.
* **D: Chupe ndojehúi mba’eve** (They don't know what they did) - This is incorrect; they are accused of carrying an explosive.

Here's why:

The text states ""Mburuvichakuéra ndoikuaái gueteri héra, jepéramo oikuaáma ha’eha étnia Uigur-guaha."" (Investigators don't know his name, but they know he is Uigur.)  This directly answers the question of what information the investigators have about the explosion – they know the suspect’s ethnicity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi omo’ãva’ekue identidad** (They are revealing his identity) - The text says they *don't* know his name, so this is false.
* **C: Pe mba’e omokyre’ỹva ojejapo hag̃ua pe explosión** (What motivated the explosion) - The text doesn't mention the motivation.
* **D: Pe tapicha oje'eha réra ha herajoapy** (The suspect’s name and injury) - The text says they *don't* know the name and mentions injury *after* the explosion, not as a known fact beforehand.

This translates to: ""The next match regarding this result will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, with the Springboks playing against Australia.""

Springboks is the nickname for the South African rugby team. Therefore, the match at Ellis Park is between South Africa and Australia."
Moõpa oha'ãta Springboks' partido oúva?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Springboks oha'ãvove Australia ndive."" which translates to ""...Springboks will play against Australia.""  This clearly indicates their next match is against Australia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rustenburgo-pe** - Rustenburg is where a *previous* match was played, not the location of their next game.
*   **C: Johannesburgo-pe** - Johannesburgo is mentioned as a location for a future game, but not the *immediate* next one.
*   **D: Nueva Zelanda-pe** - Nueva Zelanda (All Blacks) were the opponent in the game described, not the next opponent.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...jepéramo oho kuri chugui peteĩ giroscopio peteĩ tembiapo estación espacial-pe..."" ( ""...they are taking a gyroscope for a work on the space station..."").  The text details how Chiao and Sharipov are preparing to install and work with the gyroscope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñeñemombyry hekopete umi propulsor-gui (They are helped by the propulsors):** While propulsors are mentioned for maneuvering, they aren't the *primary* focus of this particular task.
* **C: Oñemyendy avión (They use airplanes):** Airplanes are used to *support* the space station, not directly involved in the work *on* the station itself.
* **D: Oñemohenda porã jey (It is being improved):**  This is a general statement about the station but doesn't relate to the specific task described in the text.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...oho kuri chugui peteĩ giroscopio peteĩ tembiapo estación espacial-pe..."" which translates to ""...they are taking a gyroscope for a job on the space station..."". This directly indicates the purpose of the activity is to install a gyroscope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oñemoaguĩvo umi propulsor mohendaha rehe** (They are preparing the maneuvering thrusters) - While mentioned, this is *how* they're doing the work, not the work itself.
* **C: Oñemohu’ãvo peteĩ caminata espacial** (They are preparing for a spacewalk) -  The text mentions a spacewalk (""caminata espacial""), but it doesn't say it *is* the purpose of the work, only that it’s involved.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the action was intended to disrupt massive email sending (and specifically mentions spam).**  This is what option C directly addresses. The goal was to stop the flow of emails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñembohasa kuri pe estado oimehápe AOL róga** (The event happened at the state where AOL's house is located) - The passage states it happened *in* Virginia, but doesn't focus on the physical location of AOL's headquarters as the core issue.
* **B: Ojeguereko peteĩ condena** (There was a conviction) - While a conviction *exists* related to this, the passage focuses on *what the action was intended to do*, not the outcome of a legal case.
* **D: AOL-pe ojehepyme’ẽkákuri oikóvo** (AOL was being paid to exist) - This is nonsensical and not mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Internet kuave'ẽmby omotenodéva AOL..."" (the internet transmission originated with AOL...) and goes on to describe how this transmission caused a massive disruption, including spam. This implies AOL was responsible for a problematic and *uncontrolled distribution* of data.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Upe ojehúva oike mokõi Internet kuave'ẽmby rehegua** (The case involves two internet transmissions) - The passage focuses on *one* transmission originating from AOL.
* **C: Upe ojehúva oñembohasa kuri ary 2003-pe** (The case was initiated in 2003) - While 2003 is mentioned, it's when the actions *took place* (to try to cause chaos), not when the case was initiated.
* **D: AOL omoñepyrũ procesamiento pe káso rehegua** (AOL started processing the case) - The passage doesn't mention AOL starting processing the case; it describes AOL *being the source* of the problem.

The passage states ""Vidal ojapoma mbohapy ara vore, Sevilla gui."" (Vidal played three years, going to Sevilla).  It then says ""Ou rire ko Catalan tavaguasupe, Vidal ojuga kuri 49 partido ko clubpe."" (After that, in the Catalan giant, Vidal played 49 games for the club). This clearly indicates the ""club"" being referred to is Barça (Barcelona), as it's described as the ""Catalan giant"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sevilla-pe:** Vidal *left* to go to Sevilla, he didn't play 49 games *for* Sevilla in this context.
*   **B: Cataluña-pe:** Cataluña is a region, not a club.
*   **D: Capital-pe:**  This is too vague and doesn't align with the information provided.



"
Mboy partido ojuga kuri Vidal Barça-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text states: ""Ou rire ko Catalan tavaguasupe, Vidal ojuga kuri 49 partido ko clubpe."" which translates to ""After arriving at the Catalan giant, Vidal played 49 games for the club."" 

Therefore, Vidal played 49 games for Barça."

The text states: ""Opyta kuri equipo ha’e oĩha hotel-pe partido oha’ãtava arateĩ **Bolonia** rovake mboyve.""  This translates to ""The team is staying at the hotel preparing for a match against **Bolonia**.""

Therefore, Bolonia is the team they are playing against.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Opyta kuri equipo ha’e oĩha hotel-pe partido oha’ãtava arateĩ Bolonia rovake mboyve.""  This translates to ""His team is staying at the hotel to play a match before the Bologna tournament.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

The passage states the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.5, and *because of this* there was no tsunami warning. The reason Yakarta didn't receive a tsunami warning is directly linked to the earthquake's relatively low magnitude.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndaipórikuri ñemongyhyje tsunami rehegua** (There was no tsunami warning) - This is a *result* of the magnitude, not the reason *why* there wasn't a warning.
* **B: Ani hag̃ua okyhyjeterei tapichakuéra oikóva upépe** (To prevent people living there from panicking) - The passage doesn't say this is the reason.  People *are* panicking and evacuating.

* **C: Peteĩ ñemosarambi marãndu tsunami rehegua** (A tsunami advisory) -  Similar to B, the passage focuses on a lack of official warnings.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states:

* **Hendykue ha ijere** are the initial forces driving the systems.
* These forces are used to create the **Rossby wave**, which is related to plasma flow.
* The **Rossby wave** is crucial for the magnetic inversion process.

Therefore, all three – hendykue, Rossby wave, and ijere – contribute to driving the Sun's activity and other celestial body activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hendykue ha plasma flujore** - Plasma flow is a *result* of the Rossby wave, not a primary driver mentioned in the text.
* **B: Rossy papaha, ijere ha umi inversión magnética** - Magnetic inversion is a *process* affected by the wave, not a driving force itself.
* **C: Ijere ha hendykue** - While important starting points, they don't tell the whole story of how the system is propelled, as the Rossby wave plays a crucial intermediate role.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""...Pe hendykue ha ijere ojeipuru oñondive oñemoi haguã Rossby papaha..."" which translates to ""...The vorticity and divergence are used to identify Rossby waves..."". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe plasma flujo retakue (The plasma flow retake):**  While the passage *relates* Rossby waves to plasma flow, it doesn't say flow *is* how you identify them.
* **C: Pe tembiapo retakue (The work retake):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Umi inversión magnética retakue (The magnetic inversion retakes):**  The passage says Rossby waves can be related to magnetic inversions, but not that they *are* identified by them.

Here's why:

The text states: ""31% oimo'ã araka'eve Australia-gui ndoikói a'erã peteĩ república"" which translates to ""31% believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.""  Julia Gillard was campaigning *for* a republic, but the question asks what people believed *about* becoming a republic, and the text clearly states a significant percentage believed it shouldn't happen ""at all"" (araka'eve).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikatuvovéntema:** The text says 29% were in favor *with conditions*, not generally.
*   **B: Opa rire reina Isabel II reinado:** This is the timing of the campaign, not the belief.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Energía ha Ñemureko Representante-kuéra Cámara:** This is where the subcomité is *located*, not the entity doing the investigation.
* **B: Fundación Komen:** Komen is seeking the investigation, they aren't *doing* it.

Therefore, the text explicitly says people *kidnapped* the Swiss woman, meaning she is missing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ojejuhu jey umi mba'e oñemondava'ekue chugui** - ""They still have what was stolen from them."" This doesn't address the woman's whereabouts.

The text explicitly states: ""...oñembojopói rire 2007 Taiwán Ñembokakuaapuku Jopói ndive ome'ẽva Mburuvicha Yuan República de China-gua."" which translates to ""...was presented at the 2007 Taiwan Excellence Awards with a commendation from President Yuan of the Republic of China.""  And the preceding sentence introduces ASUS as the manufacturer of the Eee PC. Therefore, ASUS was the company recognized at the Taiwan Excellence Awards in 2007.



"
Mba'épa pe ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ computadora portatil** (A laptop).

Here's why:

The text describes the ASUS Eee PC as being presented at a computer show (Taipei Computer Show) and awarded a prize by the President of the Republic of China. This strongly indicates it's a type of computer, and specifically, it's described as being small and working well – characteristics of a laptop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ pumbyrymýi iñarandúva** (A small informative tool) - Too vague. While it *is* small, it's a specific type of tool.
*   **C: Peteĩ tableta** (A tablet) - Tablets weren't as prevalent in 2007 as laptops were, and the description doesn't suggest a touchscreen device.
*   **D: Peteĩ localizador** (A locator) - This has no connection to the context of the text.



"
Mávapa ha’e responsable umi documemto postal okañýva rehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ mitã**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""oñomihague 600 documenteo postal rupi, ijapytepekuéra 429 postal Ary Pyahu rehegua"" which translates to ""stole 600 postal documents, including 429 related to Ary Pyahu"".  It then says this was done by ""petẽi mitã"" - a child.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi omba’apóva correo-pe (Those who work at the post office):**  The text states the documents were *taken from* the post office, not that the workers were responsible for the loss.
* **B: Umi tapicha oikóva Obanazawa-pe (People who live in Obanazawa):**  The location is simply where the post office is, it doesn't make the residents responsible.
* **D: Marandu myasãihakuéra (Investigators):** The investigators are investigating *after* the documents were stolen; they aren't responsible for the theft.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ojejerure toñeñyrõmi chupekuéra  umi documento postal  okañýva rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Marandu myasãihakuéra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...marandu myasãihakuéra ojejerure toñyrõmi chupekuéra tavaygua ha marandu myasãihakuéra ohechakuaa rire peteĩ mitã oñomihague 600 documenteo postal rupi...""  This directly translates to ""...the investigators will investigate them [the people] and the investigators will see a child who took 600 postal documents...""

Therefore, the *investigators* are the ones who will review the postal documents after seeing the child with them.



"
Araka'épa oikotevẽkuri Del Potro oñeipohãno ijati’ýpe?,"The correct answer is **C: Set mokõiha aja**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Del Potro oreko ventaja tenondete set mokõihápe, katu ápe avei oñeikotevẽ kuri peteĩ tie break oñeguahẽ rire 6-6 peve."" This directly translates to ""Del Potro has an advantage in the second set, but he still needs to play a tie break after reaching 6-6.""  Therefore, Del Potro needs to play a tie break *in the second set* even though he's ahead.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Set peteĩha aja** - The text doesn't mention needing a tie break in the first set.
*   **B: Tie break peteĩha mboyve** - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific situation described.
*   **D: Tie break mbohapyha rire** - The text doesn't mention anything about a third tie break.



"
Mba’éichapa osẽ pe tie break peteĩha?,"The correct answer is **A: Operde Murray set peteĩha** (Murray lost the first set).

Here's why:

The text states that a tie break is needed to decide the first set *after* both players have already played a set. It then says Murray needs to win a tie break to avoid losing a set.  The final sentence indicates that Del Potro is fighting, implying Murray is struggling.  Therefore, the tie break must have been won by Del Potro, meaning Murray lost the first set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del Potro operde oñehunga rire** (Del Potro lost after getting frustrated) - The text doesn't say Del Potro lost. It says he's fighting.
* **C: Ogana Murray set mokõiha** (Murray won the second set) - The text is about the *first* set and the possibility of a tie break in the second.
* **D: Ogana Del Potro set mokõiha** (Del Potro won the second set) -  Same reason as C – the passage focuses on the first set.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa, específicamente ojojuhúkuri pe hasýva ndive?","The correct answer is **B: Mitã**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko árape roñemoamrandu oĩhague mitã ohóva gueteri mbo’ehaópe ojeikuaaha ojojuhuhague pe hasýva ndive"" - which translates to ""Today we are concerned about children going to school being accompanied by the tragedy.""

This clearly indicates the children (mitã) are the ones being accompanied by the tragedy (pe hasýva). The other options are not directly mentioned as being accompanied by the tragedy in the text.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e seguridad nome’ẽi pe gobernador oñe’ẽvo umi Texas tavayguápe?","The correct answer is **A: Pe sistema oikoha** (The system works).

Here's why:

The governor states, ""Kóva ivaieterei. Eikuaáke ore sistema oikoha hína tekotevẽhaichaite."" which translates to ""This is reassuring. Believe me, our system is working as it should."" This directly addresses the security concerns by stating the system is functioning properly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojejapoha hína tekotevẽva oñeñangareko hag̃ua hekoitépe tavayguakuéra rehe** (Efforts are being made to protect the people) - This is mentioned, but it's not the *security* he assures them of, but rather what's *being done*.
* **C: Haʼekuéra hembiporuporã oñembohovake hag̃ua ko ko'ápe oñeñe'eva** (They are well prepared to receive those who come here) - This refers to preparedness, not a statement about the system’s security.
* **D: Kóva ndaivaietereíri** (This is not reassuring) - This is the opposite of what the governor says!



"
Mba'e fuente momarãndu ñeha'ã pukarã omoheñóiva’ekue mokõi temimbo'ekue UW-peguare?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Oñepyrũ guive, The Onion-gui oiko momarãndu ñeha'ã pukarã tuicha añetéva..."" (Initially, a large satirical memo originated from The Onion...).  It goes on to describe the memo and how it relates to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's time at Washington University.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: The Colbert Report:** This is a show *featured* in the memo's story, not the source of the memo itself.
* **B: Aranduróga Jeporavoguápe (2000 Election):** This is an event *mentioned* in connection to the memo (Al Gore's involvement), but not the source.
* **C: The Daily Show:**  Similar to The Colbert Report, this is a show *featured* in the memo's story, not the source.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui noĩri The Onion momarãndu ñeha'ã pukarã tuicha añetéva ryepýpe?","The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ web renda** (A website).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...oguerekóva kuatia ñenohẽ, **peteĩ web renda oguerekóva 5.000.000 puruhára jasypápe**..."" ( ""...including a newspaper, **a website with 5,000,000 users per month**..."")

The question asks what part of The Onion's large satirical operation is mentioned. The passage explicitly states they have a website with a large readership.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ yvy'ãngakuatia arapygua** (A daily newspaper) - While mentioned as *part* of the operation, the question is asking for a main component of the ""large satirical operation.""
*   **B: Peteĩ ta’ãngamýi** (A joke) - This is too broad and not specifically mentioned as a component of the operation.
*   **D: Peteĩ kuatia ñenohẽ** (A newspaper) -  Again, a component, but not the central element described as having 5 million monthly users.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'érepa oñatende tahachi kuera?","Pe respuesta correcta es **C: Jeikeha guataha Downing**.

Pe texto-pe ohechauka mba'érepa oñatende tahachi kuera: ""jeikeha guataha Downing renondepe oñatendeva tahachi kuera, upe Primer Ministro róga teete."" (Los manifestantes fueron convocados para protestar fuera de Downing Street, frente a la residencia del Primer Ministro).

Las otras opciones son lugares por los que pasaron, pero no la razón por la que se reunieron.
"
Mba'e aravópepa tahachi kuera ojerure umi ava kuera ñe'ẽngurupe tojevy upe guataha rembere ani hag̃ua hetaiterei mba'yru jehasa ?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 aravo jave**.

The text states: ""11:20 aravope, tahachi kuera ojerure umi ava kuera ñe'ẽngurupe tojevy upe guataha rembere, omomarandu chupe kuera ha'ekuera ombojoja vaerãha upe iderecho kuera iñe'ẽnguru haguã upe mba'yru jehasa ndive.""  This translates to: ""At 11:20, the police encountered the protesters near the barrier, questioned them and reminded them of their right to protest without causing disruption.""

Therefore, the police encountered the protesters at 11:20 to prevent excessive disruption.



"
Mba’épa oĩ añeteguáva pe tapykueho ojapova’ekue Dr Ehud Ur ryepýpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi resultado ikatu oipytyvõ umi avakuérape oguerekóma va'ekue Tuguy Azuka tipo I-pe** (The results could help people with Type 1 Diabetes).

Here's why:

The text states Dr. Ur believes the research *could be important for people with Type 1 Diabetes*.  The other options are either statements *about* the research (B & D) or represent his skepticism about being able to predict the condition (C).  The core of his statement is the *potential benefit* to those *with* Type 1 Diabetes.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ndogueroviái  Dr. Ur?","The correct answer is **A: Oiménepa umi mba’e ojuhúva oguerekópa importancia umi avakuérape oguerekóma vaekue Tuguy Azuka tipo I-pe g̃uarã.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""ha oikuaauka ko ojuhúva ndoguerekoiha importancia umi avakuérape oguerekóma vaekue Tuguy Azuka tipo I-pe g̃uarã.""  This directly translates to ""and he believes this situation does not give importance to those people who have Type I Diabetes.""  Dr. Ur doesn't believe the current situation is important *for* those with Type I Diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ikatúpa oñemonguera** (Whether it can be offered) - The text says he *doesn't* believe it can be offered (or its importance isn't recognized).
* **C: Umi ambue experto he'íva ñemonguera rehe** (What other experts say about offering it) - The text mentions other experts, but doesn't specify what Dr. Ur disagrees with *about* their opinions on offering it.
* **D: Umi anguja ndoguerekóiva Tuguy Azuka opytáta upéicha** (That patients without diabetes are treated this way) - The text is specifically about Type I diabetes patients.

Mávapa ko’ã ñe’ẽ apytégui nomombe’uporãi pe accidente vuelo CG4684  rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe aviõ ñepyrũrã ndaikatúikuri oguejy árarekovaigui** (The plane initially couldn't take off due to the weather).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Twin otter oĩ hína kuri oñeha’ã oguejy hag̃ua Kokoda-pe kuehe vuelo CG4684 Airlines PNG mba’évaramo."" (The Twin Otter was trying to take off for flight CG4684 Airlines PNG in Kokoda, but something was preventing it.)  And later implies bad weather was the reason: ""Pe árarekovai omyañava’ekue ojeguejy pya’e hag̃ua avei omoñepysãnga tuicha jeporeka oñemboguatáva."" (The bad weather was hindering take-off and causing a significant delay.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe aviõ ho’a peteĩ tenda hasyetereihápe ojeike** (The plane crashed into a tent that was set up.) - While the passage mentions a tent and police searching the area, it doesn't say the *cause* of the accident was hitting a tent.
* **C: Pe aviõ oñeha’ã oguejy mbohapy jey ho'a mboyve** (The plane attempted to take off three times before crashing.) - The passage doesn’t mention multiple attempts.
* **D: Árarekovai omoñepysãnga tuicha jeporeka oñemboguatáva ojehuhu hag̃ua aviõ ho'ahague** (The bad weather causing a significant delay was seen when the plane crashed.) - This is a consequence of the weather, not the *cause* of the initial problem.



"
Mba'épa  omyañava'ekue ojeguejy pya'e hag̃ua pe vuelo CG4684 ?,"The correct answer is **D: Pe árarekovai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe árarekovai omyañava’ekue ojeguejy pya’e hag̃ua avei omoñepysãnga tuicha jeporeka oñemboguatáva.""  This translates to: ""The bad weather is being blamed for trying to continue the flight, also requiring a large investigation into what happened.""

Therefore, the bad weather is what they are blaming for attempting to continue the flight CG4684.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pe tenda jeguejyharãme ndaikatúi ojeike** - (The route couldn't be accessed) - The text doesn't mention the route being inaccessible.
*   **B: Oĩkuri heta ambue aviõ CG4684 renondépe** - (There are many other planes on the CG4684 route) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Pe aviõ oñemombiajey Kokoda gotyo** - (The plane was moved towards Kokoda) -  The text states the plane was *trying* to get to Kokoda, but doesn't say it was moved there.

"Oje’eháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa añetegua ko'ã mba'e oje'éva Franciszek Kowal experiencia rehe?","The correct answer is **C: Ojoka peteĩ apyka oñeha’ãvo osẽ hag̃ua** (They are trying to escape through a basement).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Tapichakuéra ombota apykápe umi vidrio, hakatu ko’ãva ojeka’ỹva ra’e."" (People are hitting the glass in the basement, but it seems strong.) This clearly indicates people are *attempting* to escape *through* the basement.
* **Franciszek Kowal's quote:** “Hasypeve, peteĩ vidrio ojeka ha osẽjoa tapichakuéra ovetã rupi”, he’i Franciszek Kowal, tapicha oikovéva. ( ""Eventually, a glass will break and people will escape through it,"" said Franciszek Kowal, a resident.) reinforces the idea of an escape attempt via the basement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojoka peteĩ ovetã** (They are escaping) - The text doesn't say they *have* escaped, only that they *are trying* to.
* **B: Amo ipahápe ndojehúi chupe mbaʼeve** (It doesn't matter if it doesn't affect him) - This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on the escape attempt.
* **D: Oñehunga oñeha'ãvo ojoka peteĩ ovetã** (They are hungry and trying to escape) - The text makes no mention of hunger.



"
Mba'ére ijetu'u ojeikuaa hag̃ua mba'éichapa opokóta arapochy tropical Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Pe tormenta oĩ mombyry gueteri yvýgui** (The storm is still far from land).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Arapochy oĩ rupi mombyry gueteri yvýgui, hasy gueteri ojeikuaa haguã mba'éichapa opokóta Estados Unidos ha Caribe rehe."" This directly translates to ""The tropical storm is still far from land, and they are watching to see how it will affect the United States and the Caribbean.""  This means scientists are monitoring it *because* it's far away and they need to predict its path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oje'e ko tormenta imbaretevétaha oiko peve chugui peteĩ huracán** (It is said that the storm may become a hurricane) - While the passage *mentions* the possibility of it becoming a hurricane, it doesn't explain why they are watching it.
* **B: Umi kuaarekahára ndoikuaái umi yvytu ohupytýva pe tormenta** (The forecasters don't know the wind speeds of the storm) - The passage *states* the wind speed (40 mph/64 kph), so this is false.
* **D: Ko tormenta opyta mombyryeterei Miami-gui** (This storm is very close to Miami) - The passage says it's 3000 miles from Miami, which is *not* close.



"
"Oje’eháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa umi mbaʼe ojeʼévagui pe Arapochy Tropical Danielle rehegua ndahaʼéi añetegua?","The correct answer is **A: Ndojekuaái mba'éichapa opoko Caribe rehe** (It is not known how it will impact the Caribbean).

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""...hasy gueteri ojeikuaa haguã mba'éichapa opokóta Estados Unidos ha Caribe rehe."" This translates to ""...they are waiting to see how it will affect the United States and the Caribbean.""  The phrase ""hasy gueteri ojeikuaa"" means ""they don't yet know"" or ""it's still uncertain.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oñemoheñói Océano Atlántico-pe** (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean) - This *is* stated in the text, but it's not something the text says is *unknown* about Danielle. It's a known fact.
* **C: Ikatu oiko chugui peteĩ huracán** (It could become a hurricane) - The text states it *could* strengthen into a hurricane, so this isn't an unknown.
* **D: Hi'aguĩma yvýgui** (It's far from land) - The text states it's 3000 miles from Miami, so its distance is known.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ambue estudio he'i upe mba'asy sa'ive oporojukakuaa va'erãha oiko mboyve chugui peteĩ epidemia global..."" This directly translates to ""Another study says this disease *can be easily transmitted* before a global epidemic occurs...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sintoma-kuéra sa'íramo gueteri** (Having symptoms that are not typical) - While mentioned, this isn't the *reason* for potential global spread, but a characteristic of the cases.
* **C: Oñembohasa va'erã hetave tapicha rehe** (Many people are getting infected) - This is a *result* of spread, not the cause of a potential epidemic.
* **D: Mitãnguéra oguerekova’erã síntoma** (Children are having symptoms) - Similar to B, this describes *who* is affected, not *why* it could become a global epidemic.

"Pe pehẽngue heʼiháicha, mboy mombyry piko Fujian-gui oĩ pe yvytu atã?","The correct answer is **B: 11 kilómetro**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Oje’e peyvytu atã ohoha China gotyo once kilómetro peteĩ aravo aja.""  This directly translates to ""It is said that the typhoon will enter China by eleven kilometers in one day.""

Therefore, the distance the typhoon will travel into China is 11 kilometers."
Mávapa omomaiteĩ kuri George W Bush-pe oguahẽvo Asia-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ha Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The text states that George W. Bush was *greeted* by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and had a *conversation* about security and terrorism with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  These are the individuals who welcomed and engaged with him upon his arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mburuvicha Peteĩha (First Gentleman)** - The text doesn't mention any First Gentleman.
* **B: Ava kuera (The people)** - While he addressed ""his people"" later, they didn't *greet* him.
* **D: Mburuvicha Mokõiha (Deputy Prime Minister)** - Only one deputy prime minister is mentioned (Wong Kan Seng), and he was part of a larger welcoming party including the Prime Minister.



"
Araka'épa oñe'ẽ mburuvicha upe ñemu okakuava hina Asiape rehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Oñembotapykue rire upe jeiporavo ku'a peguape** (After finishing the working visit).

The text states: ""Ára pokõi rire oñembotapykue haguepe upe jeiporavo ku'a peguape, Bush he'i kuri ava kuerape upe ñemu okakuava hina Asiape.""  This directly translates to ""After finishing the working visit, Bush told the people that the war was spreading in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oguahẽvo Singapur-pe** (Going to Singapore) - This is *when* he spoke, not *what* he spoke about.
* **B: Wong Kan Seng ndive** (With Wong Kan Seng) - He spoke *to* Wong Kan Seng, but the statement about the war was made after the visit.
* **D: Ára jeguata Asiare aja** (During the trip to Asia) - The text specifies *after* the visit in Singapore, not generally during the Asia trip.

**Here's why:**

The question asks what the passage says this *is* - referring to ""ko'ãva apytégui ha'e sãmbyhyha jehupytyrãguasu"" (what is this about?). The passage explicitly states the activity is about distributing seedlings in April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oñehepyme'ẽ 300 mba'yru** (Distributing 300 seedlings) - This is *part* of the information, but not the full scope. It says between 300-1300.
* **C: Ohupi 1.300-pe mba'yru retakue oñehepyme'ẽtava** (Up to 1,300 seedlings are being distributed) - Again, just a detail about the *quantity*, not the overall activity.
* **D: Ojoramie hag̃ua ojo'aripa ñeime mba'yrúpe** (To be able to identify the name of the seedling) - This describes the *purpose* of the distribution, not the distribution itself.

Mbaʼépa oikuaauka pe sãmbyhyha?,"The correct answer is **B: Oñe'ẽme'ẽ ojoramietaha mba'yru rehegua apañuãi** (It announces a competition related to fruits).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Marãndu ko aragua avei ombotuichave sãmbyhyha ñe'ẽme'ẽ ojejapova'ekue jasyapýpe..."" This translates to ""This year, they are also announcing a competition through a notice in April...""  The *sãmbyhyha* is described as being announced *through a notice*.
* **The passage continues to describe the competition:**  It details that people can submit fruits (300 to 1300) to participate and win a prize (ojo'aripa ñeime).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oplantea oñehepyme'ẽve haguã 300 mba’yru** (It plans to submit 300 fruits) - This is about *participating* in the competition, not what the competition *is*.
* **C: Ombosako’i ohepyme'ẽve hag̃ua 1300 mba’yru** (It aims to submit 1300 fruits) - Same as A, this is about participation.
* **D: Pe ojo'aripa ñeime mba'yrúpe oñemohu’ãta jasyapýpe** (The fruit prize will be awarded in April) - This is about the *result* of the competition, not what the competition *is*.

"Oje’eháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼe marandúpa ojekuaa?","The correct answer is **B: Amenaza guasu opamaha**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *understood* from the passage. The passage states that even though there isn't intelligence *initiating* an attack, there *is* a significant threat looming (""Amenaza guasu opamaha"").  This is the key takeaway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Upe amenaza nivel ñembosa'ive (The threat level is low):** The passage says the *initial* threat level is low, but then immediately contrasts it with a *larger* threat.
* **C: Oñeha'ãrõha peteĩ ataque (Trying to initiate an attack):** The passage specifically says there's *no* intelligence trying to initiate an attack.
* **D: Inteligencia omoañete pe ataque ivaitaha (Intelligence anticipates the attack):**  Again, the passage states there *is no* intelligence involved in the attack.



"
Mba'e ñe’ẽasãi protesta-kuéra rehegua ndaha'éi añeteguáva?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndojejapó rupi elecciones oiko protesta-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Protesta-kuéra oikóva, sapy'ánte ivai jepi, ha oñepyrũ kuri ndojejapó rupi elecciones, oĩ oiko va'erã kuro 2011-pe."" This directly translates to ""The protesters, even if they are few, and began to protest against not holding elections, have been protesting since 2011.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Comisión mburuvichapegua ombohovái protesta-kuérape** -  The commission *received* the protests from Martelly, not from the protesters directly.
* **C: Protesta-kuéra ojerure CEP oĩ va'ekue osẽ va'erãha** - The text says the commission suggested the CEP should leave, not the protesters.
* **D: Protesta-kuéra sapy'ánte ivai jepi** - While true, this is a detail *about* the protesters, not the core reason for their protest.



"
Mávapa he'i kuri CEP oĩ va'ekue osẽ va'erãha ?,"The correct answer is **C: Comisión mburuvichapegua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""peteĩ comisión mburuvichapegua he'i kuri CEP oĩ va'ekue osẽba va'erãha peteĩ ojejapo va'erã apytépe omokyre'ỹ haguã jeiporavo pyahu tetãme.""  This translates to ""a high-level commission said that the CEP should leave to make way for a plan to ensure the country's stability.""

Therefore, the *Comisión mburuvichapegua* (high-level commission) is the one who said the CEP should leave.

This directly translates to ""The US Gymnastics committee launched an investigation and can reveal how these abuses were reported regarding the actions of Larry Nassar...""

The passage highlights that an investigation was launched *after* the Nassar abuses came to light to understand how the abuses were reported.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jekuatia'o (A claim)** - The text doesn't state they made a claim, but launched an investigation.
*   **B: Jeikoha oñemombareteva (A protected environment)** - While creating a safe environment is the *goal*, it wasn’t what happened immediately after Nassar's abuse.
*   **C: Oñeikotevẽva ha iporãva moambue kuera ñande aty guasu pa'ũguive (Changes for the good of our great community)** - This refers to the *desired outcome* of the investigation, not what was done immediately after the abuse.

"Péicha he’i kuatia ñe'ẽ, mba'épa temimo'ã oguerekóva Gimnasia EEUU ha Comité Olímpico Estados Unidos-gua oho hag̃ua tenonde gotyo?","The correct answer is **D: Ohekávo peteĩ jeikoha oñemombareteva umi atleta-pe g̃uarã** (To create a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gimnasta Joaju Estados Unidos pegua ha USOC oguereko peteĩ temimo'ã - tojejapo pe deporte gimnasta ha ambue kuera, añete ikatuháicha umi atleta kuerape guara oheka haguã ikerayvoty kuera peteĩ jeikoha añeteva, positivo ha oñemombareteva."" This directly translates to: ""Gymnastics USA and the USOC have a goal - to reform the sport of gymnastics and others, so that athletes feel safe and have a positive and supportive environment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tomohesakã mba'éichapa umi abuso ohasa vaekue Larry Nassar** (To investigate how the abuses committed by Larry Nassar happened) - While investigating Nassar's abuse is *part* of the response, it's not the overarching goal stated in the text.
*   **B: Oheka jekuatia’o** (To avoid lawsuits) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Ohapykuerereka peteĩ jetypeka isãsova** (To implement a new safety protocol) - This is a *means* to achieve the goal, but not the goal itself.



"
Moõpa oho kuri pe barco oiko jave pe accidente? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peteĩ barco de contramedidas de minas Avenger rehegua, pe barco oho hína kuri Puerto Princesa gotyo **Palawan-pe**."" (A mine countermeasures ship Avenger, the ship was heading to Puerto Princesa in **Palawan**.)

Therefore, the ship was heading to Palawan when the accident occurred.



"
Mbaʼépa ndahaʼéi peteĩ mbaʼe añeteguáva pe barco oñeñeʼẽva rehegua pe pehẽnguépe rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Oho hína kuri Puerto Princesa gotyo**.

Here's why:

The question asks what isn't a defining characteristic of *the ship itself* mentioned in the passage. Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oguereko sede Palawan-pe** - Palawan is a *location* the ship is going *to*, not a characteristic of the ship.
* **C: Peteĩ barco de contramedidas de minas** - This *is* what the ship *is* - a mines countermeasure vessel.  It’s a defining characteristic.
* **D: Oñemomba’apo Séptima Flota de la Marina de los Estados Unidos-pe** - This describes *which fleet* the ship belongs to, but isn’t a characteristic *of the ship itself*.

**A: Oho hína kuri Puerto Princesa gotyo** is simply stating where the ship is *going*. It's a destination, not a description *of* the ship.  Therefore, it's the one thing that isn't an inherent characteristic of the ship being described.



"
Mávapa he'i pe marandu oñe'ẽva Estados Unidos tropa kuera rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

Here's why:

The text states that Donald Trump *ordered* the withdrawal of US troops from Syria *after* speaking with Turkish President Erdoğan. The marandu (report/investigation) is *about* that decision made by Trump. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tayyip Erdoğan:** While he *spoke* with Trump, he didn't order the troop withdrawal.
* **C: ISIS milicia:** ISIS is mentioned as being targeted, but they didn't make the order.
* **D: Secretaria prensa pegua:** The press secretary simply *reported* on Trump's decision; they didn't make it.



"
"Péicha he’i marandúpe, mba'e tetã oñatendeta tahachiramo umi ojejagarra va'ekue rehe?","The correct answer is **D: Turquía**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Turquia avei oñatendeta tahachiramo umi ISIS milicia kuerare ojejagarra vaekue"" which translates to ""Turkey also intends to clear out the ISIS militants there.""  

Therefore, Turkey is the country mentioned as intending to clear out those fleeing.



"
Mba'érepa oikókuri pe mba'e'aindýi?,"The correct answer is **C: Yvyty'aty ru'ãme**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pe mba'e'aindýi oikókuri **yvyty'aty ru'ãme** ha oje'e upéva ha'eha tembiapo osẽva jejapi ja'e'ỹgui.""  This directly translates to ""The substance is found **in the mountain soil** and it is said that it is a work that comes out of the earth's interior.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yvy atã:** (Ground) While related to soil, the passage specifically mentions mountain soil.
* **B: Jejapi ja'e'ỹgui:** (From the earth's interior) This describes *where it comes from*, not *where it is found*.
* **D: Arapytuvai:** (Rain) Rain is mentioned as something the substance affects, not where it originates.



"
Mba'eichagua yvýpepa oiko pe mba'e'aindýi  ?,"The correct answer is **D: Yvyty'aty**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pe mba'e'aindýi oikókuri **yvyty'aty ru'ãme** ha oje'e upéva..."" which translates to ""The substance lives **in the soil/earth** and it is eaten...""

Therefore, the substance lives in the soil (yvyty'aty). Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ja'e'ỹgui:** Means ""slowly"" - describes *how* it's done, not *where* it lives.
*   **B: Hatãva:**  Means ""strong"" - a quality, not a location.
*   **C: Yvypehẽnguevai:** Means ""rain"" - a weather element, not where it lives.

Mba'épa oha'ãrõ umi tembiguái pe yjapyhy rire?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe umi yvyku'ity toñemyatyrõjey** (They try to save the fish).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hi'ãnte tembiguáipe heta porã ojupi omyatyrõ hag̃ua umi yvyku'ity osoropáva ysyrýpe.""  This translates to ""...many good people try to save the fish disappearing in the river.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Toiko y rembe’y:** (They build nests) - The passage mentions needing nests *for* the fish, but doesn't say the people are building them.
* **C: Tahetave umi cacho corcovado:** (They want the cacho corcovado) - While the passage mentions the cacho corcovado fish, it doesn't state the people *want* them, only that they are a species affected.
* **D: Tahetave mymba saite  rekoha:** (They want a safe habitat) - This is a related idea, but the direct action the people are taking is to save the fish themselves, not just the habitat.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui oafecta permanentemente pe y jokoha jejapo?,"The correct answer is **A: Yvyku’ity**.

Here's why:

The passage states the construction of the dam (1963) required the relocation of animals to higher ground to save the *yvyku'ity* (forest/vegetation) and animals. It explicitly states the dam's construction permanently affected the *yvyku'ity*.  The other options are mentioned, but aren't identified as being *permanently* affected by the dam's construction.

*   **B: Cacho corcovado** is a fish species.
*   **C: Mymba saite rekoha** is a type of animal.
*   **D: Tuguare ñemyasãi** refers to the dam construction itself, not something *affected* by it.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...omomarãndu """"churuchuchu apoha Somalia-gua"""" omondoseha jejukarã mbokapurã rupi Kenia ha Etiopía-pe.""  This translates to ""...reports of """"Somalia-based militants"""" being responsible for attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.""

Therefore, the passage identifies the Somalia-based militants as those carrying out the attacks that are the subject of the reports in the US.



"

Here's why:

The text states the US is providing aid to ""strengthened camps"" in *both* Ethiopia and Kenya to deal with the influx of refugees from Somalia.  Therefore, the aid is going to camps across *two* countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mbokapurã umi tenda oñemomba'eguasúva peteĩ tetãmegua** (Aid to the strengthened camps in one country) - Incorrect because aid is going to two countries.
*   **B: Mbokapurã mokõi tetãme** (Aid to two countries) -  Too broad. It doesn't specify the aid is *for the camps*.
*   **D: Mbokapurã peteĩ tetãme** (Aid to one country) - Incorrect because aid is going to two countries.



"
Mávapa ko'ã tapicha apytégui ndaha'éi mo'ãhára?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""upe parlamentario ha mo'ãhára, Petros Mantouvalos oñemboyke kuri, ava kuera ikotymba'apoha pegua ojapo hekopegua'ỹva soborno ha corrupcion."" This translates to ""that parliamentarian and lawyer, Petros Mantouvalos was involved, those people associated with him carried out bribery and corruption.""  The phrasing highlights he's a *parliamentarian* first, and *also* a lawyer – not solely a lawyer like the others mentioned.

The other options are explicitly identified as lawyers (""mo'ãhára""):

*   **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are directly stated as lawyers (""Umi mo'ãhára kuera Griego..."").
*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is identified as a journalist (""kuatiahaihára"").



"
Máva ava kuera ndoje'éi oĩha  peteĩ sarambi tuichava tekoha hekopegua Griego apytepe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mo'ãhára kuera (Lawyers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...peteĩ sarambi tuichava tekoha hekopegua Griego apytepe oiko kuri ojechaukavo mba'epao hekopegua'ỹva, **mo'ãhára kuera**, fiscal kuera, defensor kuera ojapo vaekue hina umi ary kuera mboyvepe.""

This directly translates to: ""...a large network of criminal activity within Greek society is said to exist, **lawyers**, prosecutors, and defenders have been involved for years.""

Therefore, the passage identifies lawyers as being part of this criminal network.



"
Mboy yvýpa itapykue India?,"The question asks how many runs India scored. The text states: ""Inda apena ojapo 36 ñani ha itapykue 7 entradape omohu'ã haguã umi entrada kuera."" This translates to ""India scored 36 runs and the innings lasted 7 overs to complete the innings.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 36**."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mboýpa umi ijyvateveva jeike puntaje?","The correct answer is **A: 70 jeñani**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Robert Uthappa ojapo kuri ijyvateveva jeike puntaje, **70 jeñani** 41 vakapipopope oinupavo 11 irundyva ha 2 poteĩva.""  This translates to ""Robert Uthappa scored a total of **70 runs**...""

The other options are incorrect as they refer to different numbers mentioned in the text (36 is India's total, 100 is a goal, and 41 is a different statistic)."
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’éi peteĩ mba’e omoñepyrũva Adam Cuerden po'a'ỹ?,"The correct answer is **A: Política pyahucontenido meña rehegua upe sitiope**.

Here's why:

The text states that Adam Cuerden is investigating those who are complaining about Wikinews content *specifically regarding a policy about biased content on the site*. The text mentions a desire to establish a content policy for the site, referencing open-source media.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gales-pegua arte ñembogue:** While Wales is mentioned, it's about *where* Cuerden is from, not the subject of his investigation.
* **C: Nohendúi chupe Gales:** The text doesn't say Cuerden doesn't know about Wales.
* **D: Umi japu oje’éva pe arte ñembogue rehegua:** This refers to the *complaints* themselves, but Cuerden is investigating the underlying *policy* issue that causes those complaints.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa oñembogue pe sitio-gui?","The correct answer is **B: Contenido meña rehegua** (Content about lies/falsehoods).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...upe ñeha'ã ko'agãguape ojehai haguã peteĩ **politica contenido meña rehegua** upe sitiope..."" which translates to ""...this effort to establish a **policy on false content** on the site...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Arte** (Art) - The passage doesn't mention art.
*   **C: Peteĩ apopyrã política rehegua** (A support for a policy) - It's *about* creating a policy, not supporting one.
*   **D: Medio kuera ha’éva privado** (Private media) - The text mentions media with *open licenses*, meaning they are not private.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼã mbaʼe apytégui Amir Khan ndoykekói?","The correct answer is **B: Umi competidor británico**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said he was worried about British competitors at the 2012 Olympics in London. The question asks what Amir Khan was worried about *according to the passage*.  Option B directly reflects that concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuñanguéra ñorãirõhára jegueroike Juegos Olímpicos-pe** (Female athletes competing in the Olympics) - While the passage mentions female athletes generally, it doesn't state Khan was worried about *them* specifically.
* **C: Umi kuña remiandu** (The women's remarks) - The passage mentions his remark *about* women, not a worry about what women were saying.
* **D: Londres omotenonde hag̃ua Juegos Olímpicos** (London hosting the Olympics) - London being the host city isn't what Khan expressed concern about.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'épa oykekota Amir Khan jepéramo oguereko hemiandu?  ","The correct answer is **A: Oñemoneĩ kuña aty jegueroike Juegos Olímpicos-pe** (They are bringing a women's team to the Olympic Games).

Here's why:

The text states Amir Khan said, ""Amo hapópe, vaicha chéve kuñanguéra noñorairõi va’erãha. Upéva che remiandu"" which translates to ""I don't like it, it seems to me that women don't compete enough. That's my opinion."" He then states he supports the British competitors at the 2012 Olympics in London.  This implies his support is *because* a women's team is being brought to the Games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umi iñirũnguéra competidor Olimpiada 2004-pegua** (The competitors of the 2004 Olympics) - The text mentions he *was* a silver medalist in 2004, but the focus is on 2012 and his current support.
*   **C: Umi Juegos Olímpicos 2012-peguare** (The 2012 Olympic Games themselves) - While the text *mentions* the 2012 Games, it doesn't say that's what he's supporting.
*   **D: Ambue medallista de plata** (Another silver medalist) - The text is about *Amir Khan's* opinion and support.

Araka'épa omano Peter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojere ñepyrũ aja calentamiento-pe** (During the initial warm-up).

The text states that Peter Lenz died *while* doing the initial warm-up at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The other options describe events *leading up to* or *following* his death, but not the moment he died.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ho’a rire bicicleta-gui** (After riding his motorcycle) - He was riding his motorcycle *during* the warm-up, but that's not when he died.
* **C: Tasyópe** (In the ambulance) - He was taken to the ambulance *after* the accident and death.
* **D: Personal médico pista-pe oĩva rehe** (With the medical personnel on the track) - The medical personnel were involved *after* he was already dying.

The text states: ""...ombeti hese iñirũ ñañanihapegua Xavier Zayat. Pya'ete oñeñangareko kuri hese personal médico pista-pe oĩva rehe..."" which translates to ""...he crashed into Xavier Zayat. Immediately, medical personnel on the track were alerted...""

Therefore, Xavier Zayat is identified as being a medical personnel on the track.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on the idea of utilizing knowledge and observations to understand situations, even those that seem ordinary.** It talks about paying attention to details (jekyhyje) and using them to form a picture of what's happening, even when things aren't immediately obvious.  It uses the example of a pilot (mimba'e oguerekóva tapichakuéra) and understanding the situation.
* **Option B directly reflects this.** It states that a passenger uses their knowledge (kyhyje orekóva) to focus on a particular observation (kyhyje ojekuaa'ỹva).  This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively observing and interpreting information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe pasajero otĩramo okyhyje rupi:**  Simply riding as a passenger doesn't necessarily mean utilizing knowledge or observing effectively.
* **C: Pe pasajero okyhyjérõ opaichagua transporte-gui:** This is a general statement about transportation and doesn't relate to the passage's focus on observation and understanding.
* **D: Ijepy’apy oúramo umi mba’e vaieterei ohasava’ekuegui ha ndojoajúiva jeveve rehe:** This implies ignoring unimportant things, while the passage emphasizes *paying attention* to details.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eheka umi oferta heta empresa de viajes-pe** (Check offers from many travel companies) - While comparing is good, the passage specifically highlights checking the *airline's* website.
* **B: Ejapo pe reserva directamente umi aerolínea ndive** (Make the reservation directly with the airlines) - This is a good idea mentioned in the passage, but the question asks about *finding* information about the fare before getting to that step.
* **C: Embojoja hepykue heta empresa de viajes apytépe** (Compare the fare with many travel companies) - Again, this is part of the process, but not the specifically recommended action mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that travelers should check the airline's website to see if there are any cancellations and rebookings *before* traveling.  It also mentions checking for information about a passenger who may have been denied boarding and how rebookings are done *through the airline's website*.  

This directly implies that booking directly with the airline gives you the most direct access to information and control over your flight, and thus the best way to secure your flight and deal with potential issues.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ejesareko pe aerolínea web renda (Check the airline's website):**  While checking is important, it doesn't *secure* the flight; it just provides information.
* **B: Ombojoja hepykue opaichagua agregador apytépe (Compare prices on all aggregators):** Aggregators are useful for finding prices, but booking through them can sometimes add layers of complexity when dealing with changes or cancellations.
* **D: Ejapo reserva directamente peteĩ agente de viajes ndive (Make a reservation directly with a travel agent):**  Agents can be helpful, but booking directly with the airline gives you more control and immediate access to information.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses goods being transported, especially commercially, and the costs associated with it.** It mentions commercial invoices, parts, replacements, and freight.  The key point is *how* things are paid for to get them transported.
* **""Flete"" directly translates to ""freight""** – the cost of transporting goods.  The passage says goods are paid for *with* freight by airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe empresa oiporúvo umi aviõ imba'éva** (The company owns the airplanes) - The passage doesn't say anything about who *owns* the airplanes, only that they are used for transport.
* **C: Oñemondóvo umi mba'e equipaje facturadoramo** (They pay for checked baggage) - While baggage is mentioned, the primary focus is on *commercial* goods, not personal baggage.
* **D: Ojehejávo pe ñeme’ẽ peteĩ empresa tuichavéva poguýpe** (The shipment is handled by a large company) - The passage mentions larger companies *having* resources, but doesn't say they *handle* the entire shipment.

Here's why:

The question asks what benefits an airline gets from joining an alliance. The original text (P) explicitly states that airlines in alliances can accumulate privileges and benefits, particularly earning points. The text also mentions the advantage of having more offerings through the alliance.  Earning points is the *direct* benefit mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Pe aerolínea oĩva alianza tuichavévape** (The airline that is in a large alliance) -  The *size* of the alliance isn't the benefit, it's what the airline *gets* from being *in* it.
* **C: Pe aerolínea evevejepiha** (The airline that participates) -  Simply participating doesn't explain the *benefit* of participation.
* **D: Pe aerolínea ikatúva omoĩ hetave privilegio** (The airline that can offer many privileges) - This is a *result* of being in an alliance, not the core benefit the airline receives *from* joining.  The airline gains the ability to *offer* privileges *because* of the alliance and its points system.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ikatu oikuave’ẽ hetave punto oviaja py’ỹivévape?","The correct answer is **C: Ne aerolínea evevejepiha peteĩ alianza iñambuévape**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How can you accumulate more travel points quickly?
* **The passage states:** ""...ehechakuaava’erã umi privilegio oñeikuave’ẽva py’ÿinte iñambue ha umi oikundaháva ohovejepiha ikatu oguereko hetave mba’e peteĩ aerolínea iñambuéva upe alianza jeseguáva.""  This translates to ""...we appreciate the benefits offered quickly with membership and those that allow you to accumulate a lot with an airline belonging to that alliance.""

Therefore, belonging to an airline *within* an alliance is the key to quickly accumulating points. Option C reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ aerolínea iñambuéva peteĩ alianza iñambuévape** -  Just being *a* member airline of an alliance doesn't guarantee faster point accumulation.
* **B: Ne aerolínea evevejepiha peteĩchagua alianza poguypegua** -  This suggests a specific, limited alliance, not the general benefit of being *in* an alliance.
* **D: Peteĩ aerolínea iñambuéva peteĩ alianza ryepýpe** -  ""Ryepýpe"" means ""strongly,"" which isn't the core point the passage makes.  The benefit is *being* in the alliance, not the strength of the alliance.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa umi tete’anduha koʼãva apytégui ikatu oñembyai ojeʼuetereíramo pe alcohol?","The correct answer is **C: Ñeikũmby**.

Here's why:

* **The passage warns about the dangers of alcohol, especially illegally made alcohol.** It highlights that even legal alcohol can harm the liver and potentially cause blindness or death. It *specifically* emphasizes the extreme danger of illegally produced alcohol due to the presence of poisonous substances like methanol.
* **""Ñeikũmby"" means ""be careful"" or ""take heed.""**  This is the most appropriate response given the warning in the passage.  The passage is urging people to be careful about consuming alcohol, especially if its origin is unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñehendu (Listen)** - While listening to the warning is important, it doesn't directly address *how* to protect yourself.
* **B: Jehecha (See)** -  Simply seeing the information isn't enough; you need to act on it.
* **D: Ñehetũ (Understand)** - Understanding the danger is good, but the passage is a call to *action* – to be cautious.



Therefore, **Ñeikũmby (Be careful)** is the best answer, as it directly responds to the warning about the dangers of alcohol consumption and encourages safe practices."
"Ojeʼe haguéicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ikatu omboguejy umi mbaʼe vai ojapóva pe alcohol?","The correct answer is **B: Uje'úramo umi alcohol ojejapo va'ekue ilegalmente**.

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily emphasizes the dangers of illegally made alcohol.** It states these alcohols often contain dangerous substances like methanol, which can cause blindness or even death. The question asks about what things are bad about alcohol, and the passage focuses on the *illegally made* kind being particularly dangerous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oje’u alcohol metanol ndive (They drink alcohol with methanol):** While the passage *mentions* methanol, it doesn't say people intentionally drink it with alcohol. It's a contaminant *in* illegal alcohol.
* **C: Hey'u sa'imi umi bebida alcohólica (They talk about alcoholic beverages):** This is just a statement from the beginning of the passage, not a danger associated with alcohol itself.
* **D: Oje’u opaichagua tapicha ndive (They drink with everyone):** This is irrelevant to the dangers discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about *where* the valuable properties are located.** The passage states the Canal District (Grachtengordel) is *in* Ámsterdam Binnenstad and contains many valuable properties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Upe Canal Distrito (The Canal District):** This identifies the *area*, not the properties themselves.
* **B: Oimeraẽ tendápe ojeporavóva Patrimonio de la Humanidad-ramo, UNESCO rehe (Being declared a UNESCO World Heritage site):** This is a characteristic of the area, not the location of the properties.

"Mba’érepa ojeporavo upe Canal Distrito Patrimonio de la Humanidad-ramo, UNESCO rehe?","The correct answer is **B: Ha'égui tenda ijojaha'ỹva** (Because it's a remarkable example).

Here's why:

The text states the Canal District was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site ""hembiasa porãmby ha arandupy ijojaha’ỹva"" which translates to ""due to its outstanding universal value and the importance of its testimony.""  This directly equates to being a remarkable example.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oñemomba’eguasúgui tembiasakue ha arandupyrupi** (Because of its history and research) - While history is *part* of the reason, the text emphasizes its *universal value* and importance as a testament, not just the history/research itself.
* **C: Ha’égui tenda ojeréva Binnenstad rehe** (Because it's located in Binnenstad) -  Location is a factor, but not the primary reason for UNESCO designation. Many things are located *in* Binnenstad, but aren't World Heritage sites.
* **D: Ha'égui yvyvy vore hepykue** (Because of its vast infrastructure) - Infrastructure is a *result* of the value, not the reason for recognition.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ombovale peteĩ jeho Phnom Krom-pe?","The correct answer is **B: Ojeviaja pe Angkor Pass rupive** (You need the Angkor Pass to visit).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Angkor Pass katuete oñeikotevẽ ojeike hag̃ua pe templo-pe, upévare nanderesaráiri va’erã nde pasaporte-gui ehojave Tonle Sap-pe.""  This translates to ""You must have an Angkor Pass to visit the temple, so remember your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe ojehecháva Tonle Sap árigui** (The one that comes by boat from Tonle Sap) - While the text mentions you *can* go by boat, it's not a requirement to *get to* Phnom Krom.
* **C: Siem Reap jehecha** (From Siem Reap) -  The text states Phnom Krom is 12km southwest *of* Siem Reap, not that you come *from* Siem Reap.
* **D: Pe viaje ygápe ojejapóva pe ypápe** (The trip that is made on top) - This is vague and not directly supported by the text.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Angkor Pass katuete oñeikotevẽ ojeike hag̃ua pe templo-pe, upévare nanderesaráiri va’erã nde pasaporte-gui ehojave Tonle Sap-pe.""  This translates to: ""You absolutely need an Angkor Pass to enter the temple, so remember your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojupívo ohasa Yasovarman templo** - While the temple was founded by Yasovarman, simply *visiting* his temple isn't a requirement to enter.
* **B: Oviaja Siem Reap rupi** -  The temple is near Siem Reap, but traveling *from* Siem Reap isn't a requirement.
* **D: Ojeho hag̃ua ygape Tonle Sap jerére** - While you can take a boat on Tonle Sap, this isn't a requirement to get to Phnom Krom.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Turista kuéra jeju hepy hina, oikoteve estado fisico, ha ikatu ojeju arahaku pente, pea hina Jasypateĩ - Jasykõi jave..."" (Tourists can go, they need to be in good physical condition, and can go for about five days, between December and January).  It also mentions that researchers need significant infrastructure – large bases. This implies travel to Antarctica is expensive due to logistics, transport, and the necessary support systems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojeikuaasérõ pe Ross Yguasu añoite (Knowing the Ross Sea’s nights):** The text mentions the Ross Sea, but knowing about its nights isn’t a requirement to *be able to go* to Antarctica.
* **C: Peteĩ pa’ũ tembiapópe opermitíva ojeho jasypakõi ha jasyteĩme (A permit to travel between December and January):** While there may be regulations, the text doesn’t specifically mention a permit as a barrier to entry.  It mentions the season *when* you can go.
* **D: Tete ñemongu'e asy (Good health of the head):**  While being mentally prepared would be beneficial, the text specifically states a requirement of *physical* condition (""estado fisico"").



"
Peteĩ turista oguerohorýva yvyty jejupi mba’e tendaAntárticape-guápe ikatu oho?,"The correct answer is **C: Península-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...oje limita hina pe Peninsula renda pe, Isla kuéra ha Yguasu Ross pe."" This translates to ""...it is limited by the Antarctic Peninsula, islands and Ross Sea.""  It then goes on to describe tourist access being limited *to* the Peninsula.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe Ross Yguasúpe (To the Ross Sea):** While the Ross Sea is a boundary of the accessible area, the text doesn't specifically say tourists go *to* the Ross Sea.
* **B: Pe tenda mbyte (The interior):** The text states specialists go into the interior, not general tourists.
* **D: Umi isla (The islands):**  Islands are mentioned as a *limit* of where tourists can go, not a primary destination.



"
Moõpa sa’ive oĩ peteĩ observatorio ipyahu nungámava?,"The correct answer is **C: Peteĩ tenda mombyryhápe** (In a mountainous area).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hetave umi telescopio tembikuaareka rehegua ko’ag̃aguáva ha’e temimoĩmby tuichaitereíva tenda mombyryetereíva ha oguereko condición atmosférica iporãva."" This translates to: ""Many of the telescopes built in this era are located in mountainous areas and have good atmospheric conditions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ tenda ndahasýivape ojeike hag̃ua** (In a place not suitable for building) - The passage implies the opposite; observatories need *good* locations.
* **B: Peteĩ táva mbytépe** (In a city) - The passage specifically mentions light pollution as a problem in cities, making them unsuitable.
* **D: Peteĩ campus universitario-pe** (On a university campus) - While some smaller observatories *might* be on campuses, the passage focuses on the ideal conditions for large telescopes, which aren't usually found on campuses due to light pollution and atmospheric issues.



"
Moõpa oñemohendáne peteĩ telescopio tembikuaareka rehegua ko’ag̃aguáva?,"The correct answer is **D: Tuichaitereíva tenda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hetave umi telescopio tembikuaareka rehegua ko’ag̃aguáva ha’e temimoĩmby tuichaitereíva tenda mombyryetereíva ha oguereko condición atmosférica iporãva."" This translates to: ""Many of the observatory telescopes in this area are located on high, dark hills and have good atmospheric conditions.""

Therefore, a telescope observatory in this area is located on a **tuichaitereíva tenda** (high, dark hill).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ museo-pe (In a museum):** The passage suggests obsolete observatories *might* become museums, but doesn't say telescopes are *located* in museums.
*   **B: Campus-hárupi (On a campus):** The passage mentions campuses contribute to light pollution, making them *bad* locations for telescopes.
*   **C: Tekombo'e rendáramo (In a teaching demonstration):** While observatories can be used for education, the passage doesn't state that's where they are *located*.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e tendápa iporãvéta peteĩ ára ojehasaséva yrembe’ýpe kirirĩháme?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Playa kuéra Tamaki Drive oime hina pe puerto Waitemata pe, yvate gotyo pe residencial Bahía Mission ha **St Heliers** pe Auckland Central pe.""  It also says these beaches are safe and have shade from pohutukawa trees, making them good for a day at the beach, especially with children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bahía Mission:** While mentioned, it's described as *near* St Heliers, not highlighted as a particularly good choice.
* **C: Tava North Harbour-pe:** This refers to the North Shore region generally, not a specific beach suitable for a safe, shady day with children.
* **D: Puerto Waitemata-pegua:** This is a harbor, not a beach itself.  The beaches are *on* Waitemata, but not *at* the harbor itself.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, moõpa oiméne ikatu ojeyta segurove?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport-pe**.

Ko playa kuéra oguereko heta yvy ku'i ha **jeyta iseguro**...""  This directly translates to ""The beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and go to Bahia Long to the north and **to Devonport to the south**. These beaches have many small islands and **are very safe**...""

Therefore, Devonport is identified as a safe beach in the passage.

"Ojevisita aja pe tenda oñemombeʼúva pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼã mbaʼe apytégui ojehecháta naiporãiha?","The correct answer is **A: Ojeactuávo solemnemente** (It is acted upon solemnly).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Emomba’eguasúkena upe tenda, solemnidad ha jepoyhu chupekuéra."" (The tent is honored with solemnity and respect for them.) This directly indicates the way the tent is treated – with solemnity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojehejávo peteĩ marca pe tenda jerére** (A mark is placed on the front of the tent) - The passage doesn't mention any markings.
* **C: Ojejapóvo ñembosarái** (A ceremony is performed) - While the honoring *could* be a ceremony, the passage specifically highlights *solemnity* and *respect* as the key elements.
* **D: Oñekarãirõ peteĩ mba’e tendapegua** (Something inside the tent is damaged) - The passage suggests the opposite – it’s treated with respect and honor.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui omombe’u lingua francas rehegua?,"The correct answer is **C: Oñembohetepyva’ekue**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes lingua francas as languages that develop organically (naturally) and are used for communication between speakers of different languages.** It states they *emerge* to facilitate understanding.  ""Oñembohetepyva’ekue"" means ""they emerge"" or ""they develop.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gua'úva (False):** While lingua francas *can* be widely used, the passage focuses on *how* they arise, not just that they are widespread.
* **B: Ndaha’éiva natural (Not natural):** The passage specifically states lingua francas are ""ñe’ẽ rapo orgánica-va"" – organic languages, meaning they develop naturally.
* **D: Heñóiva ijeheguirei (Created by someone):** Lingua francas aren't usually intentionally created; they evolve through practical need and usage.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the meaning of the passage regarding how lingua francas come to be."

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically mentions ""ñe’ẽ rapo orgánica-va"" (organic lingua francas)** as languages used to facilitate communication between people who don't share a common language, preventing isolation. This directly answers the question of what helps the ""jeykerorãva"" (languages in danger) survive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha’e umi ñe’ẽ heñóiva ijeheguirei ha avei oñembohetepyva’ekue (Languages created for a specific purpose and also improved upon):** While languages evolve, this doesn't directly address the support for endangered languages mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Ha’ehína umi ñe’ẽ oñembohetepyva’ekue oñemyatyrõ hag̃ua umi káso hasyhápe ojejekupyty oñondive (Languages used to improve cases where communication is difficult):** This is too general and doesn't focus on the specific role of lingua francas in *supporting* endangered languages.
* **D: Ha’e ñe’ẽ ojejapóva oñemomba’eguasúva umi oñe’ẽva opaichagua ñe’ẽ apytépe (Languages used to emphasize communication among those who speak different languages):** This describes a function of any language in a multilingual context, not specifically how it helps endangered languages.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Crucero pasajero-kuéra ndoikotevẽi visa rehe (eporandu mbojojahakuéra)"" which translates to ""Cruise passengers do not need a visa (entry permits).""  The question asks what a passenger will encounter on the cruise. The key piece of information is the *absence* of a visa requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabina ñemohenda (Cabin arrangement):** The text mentions cabins, but doesn't say this is something passengers *encounter* specifically.
* **C: Mbojojahakuéra (Permits):** The text explicitly states they *don't* need permits (visas).
* **D: Pe aravo oñeimétava upe távape (The time they arrive at the city):**  The text mentions a stop in a city, but doesn't focus on the arrival time as something a passenger will encounter.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ága ojehasa rupi hielo ypýpe hyapu vaipa jepi umi afectado-kuérape guarã"" - ""...so they can be helped by icebreakers for those affected.""  This directly relates to how passengers might need to be rescued *because* of the ice.
* **The question asks:** What could cause a passenger to need to be rescued?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aravo távape (Traveling to a city):** Traveling to a city isn't a rescue situation.
* **C: Visa rehegua ojejeruréva (Visa verification):** The passage states passengers *don't need* visas, so it's not a reason for rescue.
* **D: San Petersburgo-pe (To Saint Petersburg):**  Saint Petersburg is the *origin* of the cruise, not a reason for rescue.

Mba’érepa ojeporueterei catalán ojejapo hag̃ua señalética ha marandu Barcelona-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Aimete la mitad hetakuégui oñe’ẽ catalán Barcelona-pe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aimete la mitad hetakuégui oñe’ẽ catalán..."" (Approximately half the population speaks Catalan in Barcelona). This directly addresses *why* Catalan is used for signage and information, as it's a significant language for a portion of the population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojekuaave rupi castellano-gui** (It is preferred over Spanish) - The passage states Spanish is also widely used and even used in automated systems, so it's *not* preferred over.
* **B: Ha'eva'ekue upe táva ñe'ẽ tee peteĩha** (It is the city's first language) - While important, the passage doesn't claim it's the *first* language, only that a significant portion speaks it.
* **D: Mba'yrumyipuku ha ambue tenda oñeimeha oiporuve umi oñe'ẽva catalán** (Public transport and other services use those who speak Catalan) - This is a misinterpretation; it's not about *using* people who speak Catalan, but *providing information* *in* Catalan.

The text states: ""...umi interrupción oñembohape’ỹva oñemomarandu peteĩ sistema automatizado rupive heta ñe’ẽme, umíva apytépe español, **inglés**, francés, árabe ha japonés.""

This directly translates to: ""...the interruptions are announced by an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, **English**, French, Arabic and Japanese.""

Therefore, English is one of the languages used for announcements on the Barcelona Metro system.

Here's why:

The passage describes a luxury bed and breakfast that offers many comforts – beautiful surroundings, nice furniture, a pool, good food. However, it *doesn't* mention anything about WiFi.  In today's world, good WiFi is a very common expectation for a luxury accommodation, and its *absence* would be a significant omission.  The passage implies that a luxury B&B would offer features people expect, and modern travelers strongly expect WiFi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi mba’e ojeiporúva plato heve g̃uarã (Things offered with a special dish):** The passage *mentions* special dishes, but doesn't say their absence defines a lack of luxury.
* **B: Mueble yma guare tuja ijojaha’ỹva (Very good furniture):** The passage specifically states the building would have good furniture.
* **C: Umi tenda okapegua oñeñangareko porãva hese (The surroundings are well maintained):**  The passage explicitly states the surroundings are well maintained (""yvotyty oñeñangareko porãva"").

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Rambosarãme ikatu oike mba'e héva ojejuhúva tendápe upe temporada-pe térã plato hevéva ojapóva oga jára."" This translates to ""...Seasonally, there can be something special offered at the inn or a dish made with local ingredients.""  This directly describes seasonal offerings/promotions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbojeguaka ko’ag̃agua:** (This inn is expensive) - The passage mentions it's a luxury B&B, but doesn't present expense as something *distinctive* or *not commonly found* in luxury B&Bs.
* **C: Tupa ao iporãvéva:** (Beautiful views) -  While the passage mentions a view, it doesn't present this as an unusual feature of luxury B&Bs.
* **D: Tembi’u ha ñemboy’urã ojejapóva upe tetãme:** (Food and drinks made in that country) - The passage mentions *local* food, but this isn't presented as something unique to these B&Bs. Many places offer local cuisine.

El texto dice que el esquí se realizó en Taizicheng y que la competencia de Zhangjiakou está a 220 km de Beijing. Esto indica que la competencia de esquí no se realizó en Beijing.

Las otras opciones son incorrectas porque:

*   **A: Jeguerovy'a guahẽ** (Alojamiento y transporte) es parte de la infraestructura general, no una actividad que no se realizó en Beijing.
*   **C: Umi aty ipahápegua** (Las delegaciones) se alojaron en Beijing, pero eso no significa que todas las competencias fueron allí.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Beijing hosted the **Olimpiada Ñembosarái Araro'ypegua** (Winter Olympics) in 2022.  The question asks what Beijing hosted in 2022, and the text clearly identifies it as the Winter Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umi Olimpiada arahakupegua** (The Summer Olympics) - The text specifically mentions *Winter* Olympics.
*   **B: Umi aty yrypy’a reheguáva oikóva óga ryepýpe** (Groups of people living in houses) - This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **D: Umi aty ipahápegua** (Groups that support) - While the text mentions support for the games, it doesn't say Beijing *is* those groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Guyrakuéra rechahára** (Bird watchers) - While they *could* be at risk, the text specifically highlights those *working* with poultry as having a higher risk.
* **B: Tapichakuéra omba’apóva mymba okambúva ndive** (People working with wild birds) - The text focuses on *poultry* (corral-pegua mymba) specifically.
* **D: Tapichakuéra oguerekomava’ekue pe mba’asy ymave** (People who have the symptoms) -  While they are infected, they aren't the ones at *highest risk of exposure* in the first place.

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...ha avei oĩ riesgo umi corral-pegua mymba observador."" which translates to ""...and there is also risk for the bird observers.""  This directly answers the question of what the passage says about who is at risk regarding avian flu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While working with poultry is mentioned, the question asks what the *passage* states is being reported about the avian flu.
* **B:** The passage mentions many cases, but doesn't focus on *how* people are getting it – only that some are confirmed.
* **D:** The passage states that *most* cases are confirmed, not *all* – making this statement inaccurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mar Negro ha Mar Caspio** - The text mentions Vikings using routes *to* these seas, but the canal doesn't connect them.
*   **B: Lago Onega ha Río Volga** - These are part of the network, but not what the canal *directly* connects.
*   **D: Océano Sur ha Mar Rojo** - These are not mentioned in the text at all.

The passage states: ""Umi tren pyareguávape, mboguatahára ombyatykuaa pasaporte-kuéra ani oñemombáy okévape.""  This translates to: ""On the long-distance trains, conductors check passports but don't necessarily prevent passage.""  This directly answers the question about which vehicle allows passport checks *without* interrupting the passenger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi aviõ (The airplanes):** The passage says you need a plane, boat or other vehicle *to begin* immigration, it doesn't say anything about passport checks on the plane itself.
* **C: Umi barco (The boats):** Similar to airplanes, boats are a means of arrival, not specifically mentioned in relation to passport checks during travel.
* **D: Umi tren fronterizo (The border trains):** Border trains *require* identification to ride, implying they *do* interrupt travel if you don't have it.

The passage states that officials check passports *after* people are already on the train (""oku'e aja ha reguereko va'erã identificación oikóva nendive ejupívo ko'ã tren-pe"" - they get on and then they need identification to have with them on these trains). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Reke aja** (Just now) - Doesn't align with the passage, which says the check happens *after* boarding.
* **C: Nojejapói inspección** (No inspection happens) - Directly contradicts the passage.
* **D: Pe tren oho aja** (The train just leaves) -  The passage explicitly states the inspection happens *on* the train, not before it leaves.

This translates to ""...located in the high tropics, north of the equator, it experiences a lot of 'short' and intense rains (often in the afternoons, especially).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Reñemonda (Humidity):** While Singapur is humid, the passage *specifically* highlights the frequency of rain.
* **B: Ndojeikekuaái ñemuháme (It doesn't get very hot):** The passage doesn't mention temperature, only rainfall patterns.
* **D: Oñekañy (It gets foggy):**  Fog isn't mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, frequent rainfall is the key characteristic described in the passage that explains the environment of the high tropics in Singapore."

The passage specifically mentions that many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.  Someone with a nut allergy would absolutely need to avoid these pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peteĩ tapicha oiporavoséva umi mba’e he’ẽ hevévante (Someone who dislikes sweet things):** While some might not like sweets, this wouldn't *prevent* them from trying the pastries, just from enjoying them. The passage doesn't mention a reason to *avoid* them.

* **D: Peteĩ tapicha oguerohoryvéva umi mba’e he’ẽ pe umi he’ẽ jukývagui (Someone who prefers other types of pastries):** Preference doesn't equal a need to *avoid* them.

The text specifically states: ""...cereza ha **ciruela ojehecha jepi avei arahakúpe**."" This translates to ""...cherries and **plums are also seen in summer**."" This indicates plums are a seasonal ingredient used in German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manzana-kuéra (Apples):** The text says apples are used for pastries in the fall (""ary pukukuépe""), not as a generally seasonal ingredient.
*   **B: Avellana-kuéra (Hazelnuts):** The text mentions hazelnuts are *in* the pastries, but doesn't say they are seasonal *ingredients* themselves.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’emo’ãi peteĩ mba’e oñerrecomendáva ojeviaja hag̃ua sa’i pirapire reheve?","The correct answer is **A: Eheka remba’apo hag̃ua reviaja aja** (Don't be afraid to work to travel).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that one category is about ""eñaha'ã emboapýra viru jeiporu"" (working to be able to travel).  It encourages effort and dedication to make travel possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ani remotenondeterei pe comodidad** (Don't prioritize comfort): The text *mentions* comfort, but doesn't say to ignore it. It speaks of sacrificing comfort for a more intense experience.
* **C: Ejerure viru ambue tapichakuérape** (Give your things to other people): The text *warns against* taking advantage of or harming others.
* **D: Sa’ive eiporu viru tembi'u ha tenda repytaha rehe** (Spend wisely on food and lodging): While good advice, it's not the main point emphasized in the passage regarding making travel happen.

Therefore, the passage's emphasis on working to afford travel makes **A** the most accurate answer.

* **The passage states:** ""...oĩ ojejapokuaáva ambue hendáicha. Ñepyrũrã, oñemboja'o mokõi categoría-pe: térã emba'apo ejapo aja viaje térã eñaha'ã emboapýra viru jeiporu.""  This translates to ""...there are those who look for something different. Firstly, they are divided into two categories: either working to make a trip or daring to venture into the wilderness.""
* **This directly implies** that people are organizing and working together (omba'apo hag̃ua) to undertake challenging journeys (oviaja aja).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ tapicha oguerohorýva umi desafío (A person who takes on the challenges):** While the passage mentions challenges, it doesn't specifically say a *single* person takes them on, but rather people *organize* to do so.
* **B: Peteĩ tapicha hi’aravo hetáva (A person who values comfort a lot):** The passage is *against* valuing comfort too much for this type of travel.
* **D: Peteĩ tapicha ovy’áva oikundahávo peteĩ taperekónte (A person who travels to find a house):** This is completely unrelated to the passage's content.

Mávapa ko’ã mba’e oje’éva apytégui nomombe’úi hekopete pe tramo opytáva  Point Marion ha Fairmont-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Oĩ tape rural puku ha mombyrýva** (There are many rough and difficult rural roads).

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nderejpokuaáiramo emboguata mba'yrumýi tape rural rehe, eguereko nde ingenio nendive:oĩ heta pendiente ijyvatéva, carril estrecho ha curva pronunciada-va."" (You won't enjoy the ride on the rough rural road, requiring your skill: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves.)  This directly supports the idea that the roads are rough and difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate as a *general* reason for the difficulty:

* **B: Umi carril estrecho** (The narrow lanes) - While true, narrow lanes are *part* of the difficulty, not the whole reason.
* **C: Sa’i ojejesareko umi jeho pya'e apýra rehe** (Little is known about the speed limit) - The passage mentions speed but doesn't say little is known about the speed limit.  It says exceeding it is dangerous.
* **D: Pumbyrymýi kuave'ẽmby imbaretetevé jepi ko'ápe ambue tendágui** (The scenery is beautiful in this area compared to others) -  Beauty doesn't make a road difficult to traverse! It's a contrasting detail, not a cause of difficulty.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions the challenging terrain (steep slopes, narrow lanes, sharp curves) and suggests driving slower than usual (35-40 mph) *because* of other traffic. It highlights that drivers are often trying to pass others, increasing the danger.  The overall implication is that the road is difficult *and* heavily traveled, making avoiding traffic a key challenge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Noikoporãi pumbyrykuéra** (Seeing animals) - While the passage mentions the Pennsylvanio Wilds (suggesting possible wildlife), it doesn't focus on animals as a primary hazard.
* **C: Ojerévo mbaretépe pya’eterei** (Seeing beautiful scenery) - The passage mentions ""beautiful views"" but frames it as a potential distraction *from* the difficult road, not a challenge in itself.
* **D: Ojuhúvo py’ỹi oñemba’apo tape rehe** (Road construction) - There's no mention of road construction in the passage.

This implies it's *known* that a lot of prior experience isn't necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tete oĩ porãitereirasa** (The head is very good) - This is irrelevant to the requirements of canyoning.
* **C: Ojepokuaaiterei** (It is appreciated) - Appreciation isn't a requirement to start.
* **D: Ñembokatupyry michĩmi** (Little courage) - While courage is helpful, the text doesn't say a *lack* of courage is a requirement.

This directly implies the need for good physical condition.  Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Katupyryeterei atletismo rehegua** (Interest in athletics) - While athleticism helps, it's not the *requirement* stated in the passage.
* **B: Ojejapomava’erãkuri buceo upe mboyve** (To do diving beforehand) - Diving is given as *an example* of a related skill, not a prerequisite.
* **C: Peteĩ kuatia’atã barranquismo rehegua** (A guide to canyoning) - A guide would be helpful *during* the excursion, not a requirement *to be able* to go on one.

This directly indicates that a pop-up store is what will *help* someone prepare to camp with their vehicle. The other options are related, but not the direct support offered in the text.

*   **A** is about understanding your vehicle - helpful, but not the *support* mentioned.
*   **B** is about vehicle types - relevant to camping, but not the support.
*   **D** is a *location* for the pop-up store, not the support itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mba'yrumýme camping apo ikatu ojeguerekóramo peteĩ minivan tuicháva, SUV, sedán térã station wagon apyka oñenóva rehe."" (If camping is included in the trip, you could need a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon.)  The question asks what vehicle *could* be used to avoid needing a tent. A larger vehicle allows people to sleep *in* the vehicle, thus avoiding the need for a tent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojapóvo peteĩ viaje ipukuvéva tape rehe** (Making a long road trip) - This is a general description of the trip, not a vehicle solution.
* **C: Omoĩvo campaña-pegua tiendapeteĩ tenda távape térã peteĩ propiedad privada-pe** (Offering a store with a tent in a city or on private property) -  This refers to a store offering tents, not a vehicle to avoid needing one.

This translates to: ""The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city after Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish soldiers settled there, renaming it Casablanca.""

While the Portuguese initially built a fortress (Casa Branca), it was *destroyed* and the city was *rebuilt* by the Moroccan sultan. The Spanish came later and renamed it. Therefore, the sultan is the one who re-possessed and rebuilt Casablanca.

This translates to: ""The Portuguese rebuilt and restored Casa Branca (White House) after a major earthquake in 1755."" This indicates they were the ones who rebuilt the city after a significant event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umi romano** (The Romans) - The text mentions Romans *among* those who used the port, but doesn't say they rebuilt it.
*   **C: Umi España-gua** (The Spanish) - They built a fort there (""Daru l-Badya""), but didn't rebuild the city itself.
*   **D: Umi fenicio** (The Phoenicians) - They were early users of the port (Anfa) but not rebuilders.

*   **A: Cabo da Roca:** While mentioned in the text, it doesn't explain *why* Sintra was known by foreigners.
*   **B: Ojekuaahague Tupãsy María:** This refers to the shrine, not the reason for foreign recognition.

Here's why:

The text states Armenia supported the Armenian ethnicity in Nagorno-Karabakh during the conflict with Azerbaijan and helped establish a self-declared republic there.  The core issue for Armenia is the region itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe ñorãirõ umi azeries ndive (The war with the Azerbaijanis)** - Armenia was *involved* in the war by supporting the Armenian side, but the region *is* what's at the heart of the issue for Armenia.
* **C: Umi ñe’ẽasãi omopyendáva umi diplomático Azerbaiyán-pegua (The diplomatic talks initiated by Azerbaijan)** - These are a *result* of the conflict, not what Armenia is focused on.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the conflict revolves around the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory within Azerbaijan with a primarily Armenian population.  The dispute *is* about this region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Armenio-kuéra oikóva Azerbaiyán-pe:** While true, this *is the reason* for the conflict, not the conflict itself.

* **B: Oĩramo mbohapy pasajero** (There are also three passengers) - The text mentions a surcharge for *two* passengers, not three.
* **C: Ojehórõ Uptown gotyo** (It goes to Uptown) - While the text mentions Uptown Charlotte, it doesn't say the taxi *only* goes there.
* **D: Ojeguereko porã ogayguaramoguáicha** (It has good directions) - While the text notes good directions, this isn't the *service* itself, but a characteristic of the ride.

Here's why:

The text states that Chile declared its independence in 1810, *but* a decisive victory against Spain wasn't achieved until 1818. This means 1810 marked the *beginning* of their pursuit of independence, the declaration itself.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe gobierno central ipore’ỹetékuri** (The central government strengthened) - The text says the central government was weakened by the Napoleonic Wars.
* **B: Chile oganákuri España-guakuérape** (Chile attacked the Spanish) -  The text doesn't explicitly state Chile initiated an attack in 1810, only that they declared independence.
* **C: Ojegueroguatahínakuri umi ñorãirõ Napoleón rehegua** (They were distracted by the Napoleonic Wars) - While the Napoleonic Wars *affected* Spain, it doesn’t mean Chile was distracted by them in 1810. It explains *why* Spain's control was weakened.

The text states: ""Tapekuéra, mba’yrumỹpuku ha ygarata ombojoaju ojuehe umi tava’i ha mba’yrumỹi ndaikatúi og̃uahẽ upépe okahaguio.""  This translates to ""Roads, buses and boats connect the towns and cars cannot enter to preserve them.""  This implies you can reach the towns by boat (""ygarata"") and bus (""mba'yrumỹpuku""). While the text doesn't *explicitly* mention train, the Cinque Terre is very well known for being connected by a train line, making ""Tren"" (train) a logical and commonly known method of transport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mba’yrumýi térã yga rupive** (Bus or boat) - While boat is correct, the text doesn't emphasize bus as a primary way to connect *between* the villages.
*   **B: Mba’yrumýi térã tren rupive** (Bus or train) - The text doesn’t explicitly mention buses being the main connection, and train is the more common way to travel between the villages.
*   **D: Aviõ térã tren rupive** (Airplane or train) - There are no airports directly in the Cinque Terre; you would need to fly to a larger airport and then travel to the region.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cinque Terre, he’iséva Po Yvyvore, oĩ ipype umi po tava’i hembe’yrehua Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza y Monterosso...""  This translates to ""Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands, contains the five beautiful towns of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso...""

Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" means ""Five Towns.""

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’eichagua bota iporãve ojeiporu hag̃ua ro’y jave umi isỹiháme?","The correct answer is **A: Bota orekóva taco po’i** (Boots with a low heel).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes traction on slippery surfaces (ice, snow, gravel).** Low heels, combined with a good sole pattern (5mm or more), provide the best stability and grip on these surfaces.  The passage specifically mentions how the *taco* (heel) interacts with the ground (gravel, salt) to create traction.
* **Tachuelas (C) are mentioned but as *additional* equipment, not the primary feature of a good boot.** They are used *with* the boot for even more grip, suggesting the boot itself needs to be suitable first.
* **Taco yvate (C) - high heels - are explicitly *not* good for slippery surfaces.** They would make it harder to maintain balance.
* **D is incorrect because the passage states a pattern of 1/5 inch *is* desirable.**

Therefore, a boot with a low heel (taco po’i) is the best choice for walking on icy or snowy surfaces, according to the text.

This translates to ""Soles are hard and wear, gravel or juky (calcium chloride) sprinkled on roads and sidewalks to provide traction.""

While grava and juky are also mentioned, *yvyku'i* (gravel) is listed directly as a material that *helps* with traction.  The text focuses on how the *design* of the soles interacts with these materials.

Therefore, **yvyku'i** is the best answer to the question of what helps with traction on icy roads.

The passage states: ""...imandu'a ambue Hawái visitante itujávape oĩ mboyve estadía umi hotel turístico tuichávape ha ambue jeguerojera."" (…it attracts Hawaiian visitors who often stay in the large tourist hotels and other accommodations.)  And implies the same is true for the Cook Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mokõivéva ndorekói estado** (Both don't have states) - The passage doesn't discuss states.
* **C: Ojojáichagua zona horaria oguereko hikuái** (They share a time zone) - While they use the Hawaii time zone, the passage doesn't state they *share* it in the sense of it being a common factor *causing* people to confuse them.  It simply *is* the time zone.
* **D: Mokõivéva ndorekói mba'evéichagua táva** (Both don't have cities) - The passage states the Cook Islands don't have towns/cities, but doesn't say the same about Hawaii.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ha'e hína peteĩ archipelago orekóva 15 isla..."" (It is an archipelago with 15 islands...). This is a direct and key piece of information about the Cook Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate or incomplete:

* **A: Ha'e michĩve Hawái-gui (It is far from Hawaii):** While the text mentions a Hawaii time zone and comparisons to Hawaii for tourists, it doesn't define the Cook Islands *by* their distance from Hawaii. It's a detail, not a defining characteristic.
* **C: Umi tavaguasuvéva ha'e Rarotonga ha Aitutaki (The main towns are Rarotonga and Aitutaki):** The text says Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the *principal islands*, not towns.
* **D: Ko tetã ypa'ũ oguereko peteĩchagua zona horaria Hawai ndive (This island nation has the same time zone as Hawaii):** While true, it's a detail, not a fundamental description of *what* the Cook Islands are.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text."

This directly translates to ""CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of US $30, or $10 per day for the permit.""  It also mentions that you *cannot* use a credit card at Tahachi or Puerto Jiménez.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirena:** Sirena is a ranger station *within* the park, not a place to make reservations.
*   **B: Puerto Jiménez:** The text states credit cards are *not* accepted there.
*   **D: La Leona:** La Leona is a camping area, not a reservation center.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...katu jepivéramo ndoikéi trabas-pegua esquí térã montañismo alpino, ko'ã mokõi oñemboguata umi tenda escarpado-pe..."" which translates to ""...even if it's not cross-country skiing or alpine mountaineering, these two are suitable for steep slopes...""  Then it continues saying that *mochilero esquí* (backpack skiing) is what's used on steep slopes *when not* doing those other two.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Esquí senderísmo-pegua (Cross-country skiing):** The text specifically excludes this as being for steep slopes.
*   **B: Esquí huguapegua (Touring skiing):** While related, the text focuses on how it's *different* from what's needed for steep slopes.

The question asks what can help skiers who are walking to get to their starting point. A large backpack to carry their skis is the direct answer provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bota-kuéra hatãvéva (Ski boots):** While important for skiing, the text mentions needing to *carry* them, not that they *help* with the walk *to* the skiing.
*   **C: Oĩ porãramo (It's good to have):** This is a general statement, not a specific item that helps.
*   **D: Umi pista oñemyatyrõpyrévape (The prepared tracks):**  The tracks are where you ski *from*, not what helps you *get to* the starting point.

Umi viajero ohasáva shock jejujey mba’e hasy chupe ojapo hag̃ua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ojepokuaa pe cultura tenda pyahupegua rehe** (They need to learn about the host culture).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when experiencing culture shock (even before it fully hits), travelers need to *learn* the new culture (""ojepokuaa pe cultura pyahúre"") to overcome the feeling of losing connection to their home culture.  The passage contrasts this with understanding their own culture better.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ipasiénsia ha toentende** (Patience and understanding) - While patience and understanding *help*, the passage emphasizes the *active learning* of the new culture as the primary response.  It says locals need patience *towards* travelers, not that travelers just need to *have* patience.
* **C: Oviaja tetã ambuére** (Traveling to another country) - This is the *cause* of culture shock, not a solution to it.
* **D: Ojepokuaajey icultura ypy rehe** (Learning more about their own culture) - The passage states this happens *as a result* of culture shock, not as a way to *deal* with it.  It's a consequence, not a solution.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’eichagua viajero-pe g̃uarãpa hasyvéta pe shock jejujey haguére ramomegua?","The correct answer is **A: Umi viajero ohasavaíva oikévo ambue cultura pyahúpe** (Travelers who move to live in another culture).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Reju jeyro nde retãme reiko rire epytagua tetã, nde ejepokuaa pe cultura pyahúre ha eperde'imi pe nde jepokuaa nde róga peguare.""  This translates to: ""When you move from your country to another country, you learn the new culture and lose your understanding of your own home culture."" This is the core of culture shock - experiencing a new culture by *living* in it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi viajero ojeadaptáva pya'e oiko jave tetã ambuére:** (Travelers who adapt quickly to living in another country) - Adaptation *lessens* culture shock, it doesn't *cause* it.
* **C: Umi viajero oĩva gueteri jasy eiragui fase-pe:** (Travelers who are in the early stages of a month) - This is irrelevant to culture shock.  The passage mentions the *time* it takes, but doesn't define shock by a specific time frame.
* **D: Umi viajero orekóva sa’ive py’aguapy:** (Travelers who have strong confidence) - Confidence might help *cope* with culture shock, but doesn't cause the shock itself.

Mba’épa ko’ãva apytégui ndojapoiva’erã tapichakuéra alce ndive?,"The best answer is **C: Oñemomichĩ umi amenaza potencial ikatúva ojeguereko** (They identify potential threats they might have).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Even though moose aren't naturally aggressive, they can become a threat when provoked. People shouldn't approach moose because they can be dangerous and put themselves at risk.""  This implies a focus on *recognizing* and *avoiding* the situations where a moose might become a threat.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ojehechagívo oĩha hikuái** (They just see that they exist) - Simply seeing moose doesn't explain why people shouldn't interact with them.
* **B: Oñeñembojávo mbeguekatuete** (They approach cautiously) - The passage *discourages* approaching, even cautiously.
* **D: Mombyry guive ojejesarekóvo hesekuéra** (They are rescued with ropes) - This is unrelated to the passage's point about avoiding danger.

**Therefore, identifying potential threats (C) directly reflects the message of the passage - understanding *why* a moose can be dangerous and taking steps to avoid those situations.**

Here's why:

* **P (the prompt)** states that alces aren't naturally aggressive *but* can become a threat if provoked or approached. It also notes people don't realize alces can be dangerous and may put themselves at risk.
* **Q (the question)** asks what is *not* true about alces, according to the passage.
* **Option B** translates to ""People often don't recognize them as a potential threat."" This directly contradicts the passage which *emphasizes* the potential danger if alces are not treated with respect and caution.  The passage implies people *underestimate* the threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha’ekuéra ha’e mymba iñañáva** (""They are gentle animals"") - The passage *does* state they aren't naturally aggressive, meaning they can be gentle. This *is* mentioned.
* **C: Ikatu omombáy chupekuéra umi yvypóra oĩva ag̃uieterei** (""They can attack people who are near them"") - The passage *implies* this is possible if provoked.
* **D: Oñedefendéta hikuái tekotevẽramo** (""They defend themselves if necessary"") - This is a likely natural behavior, and consistent with the idea they can become a threat if provoked.



Therefore, **B** is the only statement that the passage *doesn't* support and, in fact, contradicts."

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...oipuru rei imbaretekue ha oguerekóva rembyre."" (they use their knowledge and skills).  This directly relates to using what they have to overcome the illusion (the *espejismo*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndojeguerekói ao aku peteĩ pyhare ho’ysãvape g̃uarã** (They don't have water to share with someone thirsty) - While water is a problem in the desert, the passage focuses on illusions and the dangers they pose, not simply a lack of water.
* **B: Ohechávaicha peteĩ y ra’ãnga ha’etévaicha añeteguáva** (Seeing a beautiful source of water far away) - This *describes* the mirage (espejismo), it isn't how to survive it.
* **D: Oñeñohẽmbarei y ojeho aja peteĩ y ra’ãnga rapykuéri** (They get lost and go to a source of water) - This is the *result* of falling for the illusion, not how to avoid the danger.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndoje’éi ha’eha peteĩ amenaza potencial umi viajero desierto-peguápe g̃uarã?,"The correct answer is **A: Y pokã**.

Here's why:

* **P:** The passage describes dangers in the desert like mirages (leading to illusions), getting lost, and the risk of hypothermia (even though it's a hot environment due to potential exposure at night).  These things can *trick* travelers.
* **Q:** The question asks what, from the list, is a potential threat to desert travelers.
* **Y pokã** translates to ""trickery"" or ""deception.""  This directly relates to the mirages and the potential to get lost described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Y ra’ãngagua’u:**  This means ""bad weather"" – while desert weather *can* be bad, the passage focuses on illusions and getting lost, not just general bad weather.
* **Ro’yetereirasa:** This means ""beautiful sight"" - This is the opposite of a threat.
* **Pirekaipa:** This means ""headache"" - While dehydration can cause headaches, it isn't the central threat discussed in the passage.



Therefore, **Y pokã** (trickery/deception) best encapsulates the dangers highlighted in the text."

This directly answers the question about which group was most affected by the arrival of the explorers.

Mávapepa ikatu ojeguerohory omoherakuãhaguére esquí peteĩ tembiapo ñembosarairãvaramo?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi esquí-pegua vagabundo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...sapy'ánte ojeikuaáva """"esquí-pegua vagabundo""""-ramo, ohape'apóva vacación esquí jerére peteĩ tenda ojejapohápe.""  This translates to ""...often called """"ski bums"""", who dedicate their ski vacation to living in a tent.""  This directly links ""esquí-pegua vagabundo"" (ski bums) to dedicating themselves to the activity of skiing as a lifestyle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi Noruega-gua:** While the passage mentions a Norwegian ski club, it doesn't connect them to the *origin* of skiing as a lifestyle.
* **C: Umi oikóva itakuápe:**  The passage mentions people living in tents, but not as the originators of the lifestyle.
* **D: Umi Australia-gua:** The passage only mentions a ski club *starting* in Australia, not originating the lifestyle there.

Therefore, skiing as an activity was practiced as early as 5000 years before Christ.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pe siglo 18-pe (The 18th century):** The text mentions the 18th century relates to alpine skiing, not the *first* practice of skiing.
*   **C: 1861-pe (In 1861):** This is the year the first recreational ski club was founded, not when skiing began.
*   **D: Pe siglo 17-pe (The 17th century):** This is when *alpine* skiing began, not skiing in general."

This translates to ""...Madagascar and many others, large and considered a continent separate from the mainland.""  ""Teko ka’aguy"" means mainland/continent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Europa-pegua jepokuaapy (European influence):** While the passage *mentions* European influence (colonialism), it doesn't say the islands are defined by it.
* **B: Islám jeroviapy rehegua (Islamic religion):** The passage mentions Islam's influence on Comoros and Mayotte, but not as a defining characteristic of *all* the islands.
* **D: Umi resort de playa de lujo iporãvéva (Luxury beach resorts):** The passage notes some islands are known for this, but it's not what they are fundamentally categorized *as*.

Mba’épa ndaha’éi umi isla michĩvéva África Oriental-pegua rehegua? ,"The correct answer is **D: Sãso ambue tetãgui**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Opavave nunga umi isla michĩvéva hína tetã ijeheguiguáva térã oĩva Francia poguýpe..."" This translates to ""Most of the islands are either independent countries or are part of France..."".  Therefore, the islands are *not* simply luxurious beach resorts or related to Portuguese exploration; they are, at their core, independent nations or possessions of another country (France).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ joaju Francia ndive** (An alliance with France) - While some islands *are* part of France, this isn't what they generally *aren't*.
*   **B: Heta resort de playa de lujo** (Many luxury beach resorts) - The passage mentions some are known *as* luxury resorts, but that's not their fundamental nature.
*   **C: Teko ka’aguy rehegua terekuãporã** (Good ecological environment) - The passage mentions they're ecologically significant, but this isn't what they aren't.

The text states: ""Tupãokuéra iñarandupyvéva hetave jey ogueromandu’a peteĩ Vigilia Pascual arapokõi pyhare jave, Pascua arapokõindy pahápe...""  This directly translates to ""Many Christians celebrate a Holy Saturday vigil, the eve of Easter...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Omotenondévo peteĩ ñembo’e fertilidad-reheguáva** (It is understood as a fertility ritual) - The text *suggests* a possible pre-Christian origin as a fertility ritual, but doesn't say it *is* celebrated *as* such now.

El texto dice explícitamente: ""Oñeikotevẽ boletoida y vuelta ohechauka hag̃ua mboy árapa opytáta"" (Es necesario un boleto de ida y vuelta para demostrar cuándo planean regresar).

Las otras opciones son incorrectas:

*   **A:** El pasaporte debe ser válido por al menos 6 meses, no un mes.
*   **B:** Se menciona una carta de invitación, pero no es un requisito para el cubano que ya tiene la ""tarjeta verde"" de EE.UU.

Los requisitos son una medida para controlar y regular la entrada de ciudadanos cubanos a Ecuador.

Las otras opciones son incorrectas porque:

*   **C:**  El boleto de vuelta es para asegurar que el viajero no se quede permanentemente, pero el objetivo principal es organizar el flujo.

Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ikatu hepyve ambue tetãre ambuépe reikohágui?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi marco alta gama-va**.

The passage states: ""Umi marco alta gama-va oĩva umi tendápe ikatu oguereko mokõi apañuái, ambupeva ikatu imitación, térãumi importado añetéva ikatu hepyve reikohágui.""  This translates to ""High-end frames available in stores can have two options, either imitation or imported new ones that can make it easier to take elsewhere.""

The question asks what allows you to easily take them to another country to have them fixed.  The passage specifically says *high-end frames* offer the option of having imported replacements, making repair easier in another country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ehechauka nde resa reikohápe** (Check your prescription) - While important, this doesn't help with taking the glasses to another country.
*   **C: Umi seguro tesa rehegua** (Insurance regarding glasses) - Insurance doesn't directly relate to the ability to get them fixed abroad.
*   **D: Umi marco ikatu imitación** (Imitation frames) - Imitation frames are the *opposite* of what would facilitate easy repair; they are likely of lower quality and harder to find replacements for.

Here's why:

The passage states that high-end frames might have two copies – one imitation and one genuine import.  If you're taking your prescription to a different optician (in another country), there's a risk your prescription won't be valid for the *genuine* (and likely more expensive) imported frames, but might be used for the imitation ones. This is a potential risk related to getting the correct frames with your prescription.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ikatu oñeikotevẽ peteĩ exámen adicional tesa rehegua** - While an eye exam is important, the passage doesn't suggest a *new* exam is the risk, but rather the validity of your existing prescription.
* **C: Ikatu nosẽporãi ha ndaha’éi añetegua** -  This is a general statement and doesn't directly address the risk presented in the text.
* **D: Ikatu pe seguro ndohepyme’ẽi umí rehe** - The passage mentions insurance, but the risk isn't about coverage, it's about getting the frames you pay for.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Hasyeterei emoambue hag̃ua las Malvinas viru okápe isla-gui, upévare iporã emoambue viru esẽ mboyve isla-gui."" This translates to ""I recommend changing the Malvinas currency on the island, therefore it's good to change the currency before leaving the island.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi isla okaháre oñemoneĩ tarjeta de crédito ha libra esterlina añoite** (Credit cards and pounds sterling are accepted on the islands) - While true, it doesn't capture the *preference* for exchanging currency before leaving.  The text also mentions potential issues with credit card use on some of the islands.
* **B: Stanley-pe añoite ojejagarra pe dólar Estados Unidos-pegua** (US dollars are accepted in Stanley) - This is true, but not the main point of the passage.
* **D: Pe libra malvinense rire pe libra esterlina ha’e viru ojeaceptavéva** (After the Malvinas pound, the pound sterling is the accepted currency) - This is also true, but the text focuses on *exchanging* the Malvinas pound, not just its relationship to the pound sterling.

This directly translates to: ""On the islands themselves, it may not be possible to use a credit card, but British and US currency are accepted; it is advisable to inquire about the procedures for being able to pay.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe tienda FIC West-pe** (In the FIC West store):  While the store is mentioned, it doesn't represent the *only* place you can use alternative payment methods.
* **B: Opa umi isla pukukue javeve** (All the island's towns): The passage doesn't specify that *all* towns will accept cash.
* **D: Stanley pukukue javeve** (In Stanley's towns): While Stanley accepts credit cards and US dollars, the passage highlights that on the *islands themselves* (outside of specific places like Stanley), credit card use might be limited.



"
Mbaʼe oikóvapa ndojeheʼái umi jeguerohory ojejapóva tupãopegua rehe?,"The correct answer is **B: Tupão aramboty**.

Here's why:

The text states the ritual involves honoring the spirits (tupao) and mentions practices related to ""tupao aramboty"" (offerings to the spirits) or ""Tupã aramboty"" (God's offerings).  The question asks *why* the rituals are performed. The text directly links the rituals to these offerings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ elefante heñoihague (An elephant is offered):** While elephants *are* part of the procession, they aren't the reason *for* the rituals.
* **C: Peteĩ tupã aramboty (A God's offering):**  Similar to B, but less encompassing. The ritual can be for offerings to spirits *or* God.
* **D: Umi acontecimiento tuichavéva tupão rehegua (Small events about the spirits):** This is too vague. The text describes a specific, annual ritual, not just small events.

The text specifically states: ""Tupao Kerala-gua jeguerovy'a ojehecharamó jepi, oguereko peteĩ procesión regular oĩhápe elefante oñembojeguapyréva...""  This translates to ""Even though Kerala's religious festivals are mentioned, they have a regular procession in which elephants are decorated.""

Therefore, the elephants are seen **in Kerala**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oparupiete jasypateĩ paha guive jasypo mbyte peve** - This refers to the *time* the ritual happens, not *where* the elephants are.
*   **B: Tupaõkuérape** - This means ""to the gods,"" and refers to the *purpose* of the ritual, not the location of the elephants.
*   **C: Umi procesión ojejapóva umi tupaõ jeguerovy’ahápe** - While the elephants *are* in the processions, this answer doesn't specify *where* those processions take place.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ha’e pe tape ojeiporu sa’ive hag̃ua pirapire pasajeroaviõmegua iporãvéva rehe téra ñemuha clase rehe?","The passage discusses how airlines prioritize passengers based on their class (economy, business, first). It highlights that even with a rule of first-come, first-served, economic class passengers are often bumped to make way for higher-paying passengers in business or first class. It also mentions airlines charging for baggage even though they profit significantly from those paying for premium classes.

The question asks what the passage suggests is the way to *avoid* being bumped or to ensure a better experience.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Ehepyme’ẽvo ne empresa rupive (Paying through your company):** While the passage mentions companies benefitting, it doesn’t state this *guarantees* avoiding being bumped.
* **B: Rereservarõ primera clase negocio-rãngue (Reserving business class):** This aligns perfectly with the passage. Paying for a higher class (business or first) gives you priority and significantly reduces the risk of being bumped.
* **C: Rereserva peteĩ vuelo primera clase ndaha’éiva directo (Reserving a first class flight that isn't direct):**  The passage implies direct flights are *more* desirable, not less.
* **D: Ojejuhúvo peteĩ sa’ive ojepagaha (Having a connection to pay for):** This doesn't relate to avoiding being bumped; it's about the flight itinerary.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**. The passage strongly suggests that reserving business class is a way to secure your place and avoid the issues faced by economy class passengers.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa ha’éta peteĩ perdida de tiempo ojehekárõ ojereservakuévo peteĩ pasaje?","The correct answer is **B: Ñemuha clase (Business class)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how business class (ñemuha clase) and first class (peteĩha clase) offer privileges but are significantly more expensive. It then implies that reserving these classes is a waste of time (perdida de tiempo) because the price difference compared to economy (jeveve) is large, and the benefit (comfort, space) isn't necessarily worth it for everyone.  The passage specifically mentions the disproportionate cost for the ""privilege"" of these higher classes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jeveve directo (Direct economy):** While the passage contrasts it with higher classes, it doesn't portray it as a waste of time.
* **C: Hepykue ñemboguejy (Hidden costs):** The passage mentions extra charges (ovaleva), but doesn't center around hidden costs being the main waste of time.
* **D: Peteĩha clase (First class):** While also expensive, the passage frames *both* business and first class as potentially wasteful, and business class is mentioned first in the comparison making it the primary focus.

The passage specifically states: ""...oñombohovake tarifa repy Africa-pe peteĩ tarifa yvy ape ári jerére ndive. Ani nderesarái emoĩve hag̃ua umi costo adicional, ñeikundaha adicional rehegua...""  This directly translates to needing to consider additional costs, specifically those related to additional flights/transfers to reach the final African destination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: África-gui ñesẽ rehegua impuesto (Tax for entering Africa):** While taxes are mentioned as a potential added cost, the passage focuses on the *transfer* costs specifically.
* **C: Costo ñeikundaha africana (African transfer cost):** Too general. The passage is specific about costs related to *reaching* the destination *within* Africa.
* **D: Costo mba'yrumÿi oparupitepe g̃uarã umi tenda okaháre Africa-gui (Baggage cost for flights to Africa):** Baggage costs are mentioned as *an* added cost, but aren't the primary factor being discussed when comparing a base fare to the final price.

The question asks what the passage highlights as something people start to look for when they go to these places – the answer is clearly the readily available, prepared food.

* **C: Umi karuha oĩva upe tendapevoi** (The stalls in the store) - The passage mentions stalls, but focuses on the *food* available at them, not the stalls themselves.
* **D: Hepy sa’íva** (Cheap prices) -  The passage mentions prices are ""good"" (""hepy sa'íva"") but it’s a secondary point compared to the availability of prepared food.

The question (Q) asks about the convenience offered to a customer wanting to eat prepared food. A microwave is the direct convenience provided.

* **B: Sa’ive mba’e ojeporavo hag̃uáicha** (I don't know what to offer) - This is not an answer to the question.

The passage states that while Belgian and Swiss French have differences from standard French spoken in France, French speakers from those countries *learn* and are tested on standard French in school. This implies that understanding standard French is key to understanding them, even if their everyday speech has local variations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: Oĩ ñe’ẽpu francés-pe ikatúva nde’ikuaái (There are words in French that you can guess)** -  This is a general statement about the French language and not specifically about understanding Belgian/Swiss French.
* **D: Hetave francés oñeñe'ẽva Francia retãme (There's French spoken in France)** - This is a true statement, but doesn't help understand the differences or how to comprehend Belgian/Swiss French.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...opavave belga ha suizo-kuéra francófonos , oñemoaranduva’ekue francés stándar-pe mbo’ehaópe..."" (All Belgian and Swiss French speakers are educated in standard French at school...). This is the key point – despite regional variations, they *learn* and are proficient in the standard French of France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Opaite ñe’ẽ ñe’ẽpu:** (All languages are the same) - The passage explicitly discusses *differences* between French varieties.
* **B: Pe papapy ñemohenda rehegua:** (The variations themselves) - While the passage acknowledges variations, it doesn't say that these variations are what distinguish them from France.  It's the *standard* they learn that connects them.
* **D: Pe jehaikatu oĩva umi ñe’ẽ francés-pe:** (The things that exist in the French languages) - Too vague and doesn't address the core idea of the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states that airlines like Air Canada, Delta, Lufthansa, and WestJet *offer* compassionate fares for funeral travel. However, it also mentions that you often need to *contact the airline directly* to access these fares, rather than booking through a third-party reservation service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oiméramo nde reveve WestJet-pe** (If you fly with WestJet) - Flying with WestJet doesn't guarantee the fare; you still need to *request* it.
*   **C: Oiméramo reveve Lufthansa-pe París guive Estados Unidos peve** (If you fly with Lufthansa from Paris to the United States) -  The route is irrelevant; the key is booking *directly*.
*   **D: Oiméramo nde reveve Delta-pe** (If you fly with Delta) - Similar to WestJet, flying with Delta isn't enough; you need to book directly.



"
Mbaʼépa añete umi pe ñemano rehegua tarifa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ojereservava'erã directamente aerolínea ndive pumbyry rupive** (You reserve directly with the airline through a representative).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Opaháichante, ojehechámava’erã reserva pumbyry rupive aerolínea ndive.""  This translates to ""Currently, it is recommended to reserve through an airline representative.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ome’ẽmba hikuái pe viaje funerario repykue** (It doesn't offer a discount on the funeral trip) - The passage discusses *access* to the bereavement fares, not discounts.
* **B: Ojereservava'erã directamente aerolínea página web-pe** (You reserve directly on the airline's website) - The passage specifically recommends *not* doing this initially, but going through a representative.
* **C: Ocubri hikuái viaje aravo pahápema ojejeruréva repykue** (It covers travel time that needs to be adjusted) - This is mentioned as a *reason* for the fares, not what the fares themselves *are*.

(You need a data connection for your device to work, or you may experience performance issues or it may not work at all).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Reñeha'ã jave hembyve ndéve viru** (It's often good to buy a virus) - This makes no sense in the context.
* **C: Resẽvohína pe ojagarrahágui** (It's reserved for those who pay) - The passage mentions companies offering services, but doesn't state it's *reserved* for paying customers.
* **D: Nderehepyme’ẽséirõ eiporu hag̃ua peteĩ dispositivo** (You are not allowed to use a device) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.



Therefore, the passage highlights the **importance of a data connection** for the optimal performance of a GPS navigation device or app."

Here's why:

The passage states a benefit of using a GPS device with downloaded maps is that you *don't* always need a data connection for it to work. This is in contrast to relying on an app that needs a constant connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ikatu hembyve ndéve viru** (It can save you money) - While potentially true, this isn't the *main* reason given in the passage.
* **C: Ani hag̃ua eipuru** (To not have to use it) - This makes no sense in the context of the question.
* **D: Natekotevẽi ejogua mapa-kuéra pyahu** (You don't have to pay for map updates) - The passage does mention map updates, but that's not the primary advantage highlighted when comparing a device to an app.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the need for a knowledgeable agent.** It states the agent is crucial for navigating all aspects of the Galápagos and the boat trips (""oikuaa pypuku opa mba’e Galápagos ha opaichagua barco rehegua"").  This means using an agent specialized in Galápagos travel is the best way to ensure a smooth trip and avoid issues with boats and availability.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Reserva peteĩ aty oĩháme 8 rasa pe pasajero ndeichagua avei omba’ekuaaséva:**  While reserving a spot is important, the passage doesn't suggest limiting yourself to groups of 8. It focuses on the overall complexity of booking.
* **B: Rejapova’erã pe reserva temporada oguejyve jave:**  Booking in advance is a good idea, but doesn't *guarantee* a spot, especially given the high demand.
* **D: Rejapórõ reserva voi:** Simply making a reservation isn't enough; you need help navigating the system.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ventana ha reloj-kuéra ndipóri jepi ombohetave haguã aravo ha viru oiporúva huésped-kuéra."" This translates to ""There are no windows or clocks to help control the time and the mood of the guests.""  This strongly implies a lack of standard security measures like security *guards* (""aravopapahakuéra"") who would be responsible for monitoring time and ensuring guest safety.  The passage focuses on creating a disorienting environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuarahy jehesapeporãiterei** (The sun is very bright) -  Irrelevant to the passage's description of the casino.
* **B: Ñembojopói ojeike rei hag̃ua umi concierto-pe hamba’e** (They plan to go to concerts) - Completely unrelated to the text.
* **C: Ñemboy’urã ñembojopói** (They plan to fight) - While the passage hints at something shady, it doesn't specifically mention a plan to fight. It focuses on exploitation.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa oñeha’ãva’erã omboyke peteĩ ha’ãhára iñarandúva?","The correct answer is **A: Alcohol je’ueterei (Excessive alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ambue tenda oikuave'ẽ jepi jey'urã orekóva alcohol ipe ógape."" (Another establishment allows you to bring your own alcohol.) and then later mentions ""jaka'u ojapo vaí je´pi tapicha akãre ha mayma ha'ãhára oikóva oikuaa tuicha mba'eha jeka'u'ỹre ñeime."" (something is happening where many gamblers and players are getting to know very important things in the name of the game).  This strongly implies that the problem lies with the excessive consumption of alcohol brought in by players, leading to illicit activities or uncovering secrets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oimerãe mba’e mokyre’ỹrã ñemomeĩ (Saying something mysterious during the game):**  While secrets are hinted at, the passage doesn't focus on *what* is being said, but the consequences of alcohol consumption.
* **C: Aravopapaha ñemaña (Giving away game secrets):** This is a possible result, but it’s not the core issue highlighted in the text.
* **D: Oñeporandu moõrupipa ikatu oñesẽ pya’eve (Wondering who can enter):** The passage doesn't mention entry restrictions or security concerns.

Here's why:

The passage states the rule is about identifying a ""ñe’ẽ téva"" (noun) or ""tero"" (verb) that begins with a capital letter, even within a sentence.  The question asks what is being identified within the sentence.  ""Ñe’ẽteva"" means noun, and the passage explicitly mentions nouns as being identified by the rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tero** - While verbs (""tero"") are *also* identified, the question is asking for the general thing being identified, and the passage leads with the noun.
* **C: Teroja** - This isn't a grammatical term discussed in the passage.
* **D: Ñe’ẽteja** - This isn't a grammatical term discussed in the passage.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa ikatu ombohasýve pe téro ojehai hag̃ua tai tuichávape?","The correct answer is **A: Moñe'ẽrã**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that a capital letter is used to begin a sentence *and* to distinguish a noun (a ""téro"" or word) and its object. The question asks what helps identify the noun in a small (tuicháva) way.  ""Moñe'ẽrã"" directly translates to ""capital letter,"" which is the key identifier being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñe’ẽtéva apytépe ñembojoavy:** This translates to ""classification within the noun."" While related to categorizing words, it doesn't *identify* the noun itself.
* **C: Jehaipy:** This translates to ""meaning"" or ""purpose."" It's relevant to language, but doesn't specifically address how to visually identify a noun.
* **D: Ñembojoavy umi mba’e apytépe:** This translates to ""classification of things."" Similar to B, it's about categorization, not identification.

"Malasia okaháre, mbaʼe gesto-pa heʼise “eju”?","The correct answer is **A: Ojeipokávo pe kuã jehechaukaha** (Pointing with the index finger).

Here's why:

The passage states that in Malaysia, ""eju"" is expressed by ""ojepokáva rete gotyo,"" which translates to pointing with the index finger. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ñemomýi** (Smiling) - The passage doesn't mention smiling as the gesture for ""eju"".
*   **C: Po ñembojovái** (Waving) -  Waving is described as a gesture for saying goodbye in Spain, not Malaysia.
*   **D: Ojehuívo kuãguasu yvate gotyo** (Raising the arm high) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼe gesto-pa ikatu heʼise “ejujey”?","The correct answer is **C: Ojeipepývo po oka gotyo**.

Here's why:

The text states that in Malaysia, the Malay people use a gesture of pointing their index finger to their eyes to say ""eju"" (meaning goodbye). This is described as a gesture where ""the index finger is pointed at the eye.""  ""Ojeipepývo po oka gotyo"" translates to ""pointing the finger at the eye.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ojeipepývo po hyepy gotyo** -  ""Pointing the finger at the forehead"" - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Ojeguerahávo tapykue gotyo pe kuã techaukaha** -  ""Moving the eyebrow with the hand"" - This isn't described in the text.
*   **D: Oñeñakãitývo** - ""Nodding"" - While nodding can be a gesture, it's not the one described as meaning ""goodbye"" in Malaysia.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ojapo umi grieta?","The correct answer is **A: Umi puente de nieve** (Snow bridges).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Kóva ombohapéta grieta, **ikuaha ikatúva opyta kañyhamẽ umi puente de nieves rehe.**"" This translates to ""...This creates crevasses, **sometimes allowing you to walk on snow bridges over them.**""

Therefore, the grietas (crevasses) are connected to, or can be crossed by, puente de nieves (snow bridges).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi glaciar iñambuéva** (Moving glaciers) - While the passage discusses glaciers, it doesn't say they *create* the grietas.  They *have* grietas.
* **C: Umi itakua yrypy’aguigua ho’apáva** (Caves formed by water) - The passage mentions caves, but doesn't link them to the creation of the grietas.
* **D: Umi pehẽ ojeipáva** (Steps being taken) - This is irrelevant to the text.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼãva apytégui ikatu oñeñomi umi puente de nieve rupive?","The correct answer is **A: Umi grieta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kóva ombohapéta grieta, ikuaha ikatúva opyta kañyhamẽ umi puente de nieves rehe.""  This translates to: ""This creates crevasses, which can be hidden under snow bridges.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the danger of falling through snow bridges to **crevasses (grieta)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi itakua yrypy’aguigua (The blue-colored formations):** While mentioned as a possible outcome of falling into a crevasse, they aren't the *cause* of the danger related to snow bridges.
* **C: Tapiakuéra (Animals):**  Animals aren't discussed in relation to snow bridge dangers.
* **D: Umi pehẽ tuicháva (The large openings):**  This is a general description and doesn't specifically relate to the danger posed by hidden crevasses under snow bridges.

The text states: ""Jepe Goma iseguro regular porã, opáichagua visita ñesẽtaro Goma gui, ojehecha porã vaerã ojeikuaa haguã mba'éicha pa oime umi ñorãiro oikova pe provincia Kivu Nortepe."" This translates to: ""Although Goma is generally safe, it's advisable to visit Goma cautiously, being aware of the dangers that exist in the North Kivu province.""

The passage warns travelers to be aware of the risks before visiting, not specifically the volcano (A), the towns (C), or Rwanda (D). It's the general dangers of the region that the text highlights as something to consider before visiting.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Jepe Goma iseguro regular porã, opáichagua visita ñesẽtaro Goma gui, ojehecha porã vaerã ojeikuaa haguã mba'éicha pa oime umi ñorãiro oikova pe provincia Kivu Nortepe."" (Even though Goma is generally safe, it's advisable to visit Goma being very aware of how the conflicts in the North Kivu province are). This highlights the ongoing conflict as a key consideration for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ha'e peteĩ tenda iporãva ojehapykuerereka hag̃ua umi Gorila yvyty yvate pegua oikóvape** (It's a good base for organizing trips to see the mountain gorillas). While true, this isn't a *safety* advisory.
* **C: Umi taxi moto ojeiporu porã eho hag̃ua** (The motorcycle taxis are good to use to get around).  This is practical information, but doesn't address safety concerns.
* **D: Nyiragongo volcán pyenda opyta távape** (The Nyiragongo volcano is near the city). While relevant to Goma, it’s not a direct piece of advice *for* a tourist, and doesn’t represent a danger needing caution.

The text states: ""Upévare, pe permiso jehasa haguã pe tetãre oñepyrûva hina Jasypo pe oñeme'ẽ hina 1 Jasyteĩ-pe.""  This directly translates to ""Therefore, the permit to enter the country is available starting in July and is given on July 1st.""

Therefore, the first day to request a permit for entry starting in July is July 1st (1 Jasyteĩ).

* The text explicitly states a permit is *needed* to camp in the Grand Canyon (""Permiso jehasa haguã pe tetãre"").  It details how to obtain one and its limitations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi permiso ojeguereko 1 jasyteĩ jave añoite** (Permits are available on January 1st of the year) - While the text mentions permits becoming available around January 1st, it doesn't say they *expire* on that date.
* **C: Umi permiso ikatu ojehupyty ojejerurévo ha natekotevẽi oñeguenohẽ pedido upe mboyve** (Permits can be transferred and you don't need to submit a request beforehand) - The text implies limited availability and needing to request a permit.
* **D: Sa’i papapy oñeme’ẽ umi permiso** (Few permits are given) - The text says permits are *limited*, but doesn’t specifically state they are “few”.  It focuses more on the application process and competition for them.



"
Mávapa ko'ãva apytégui sa'ive ojejuhu pe tipo de hotel oñemombe'úva pe pasaje-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ coctelería**.

Here's why:

The passage describes hotels steeped in history, associated with the railway age and transatlantic ships, frequented by the rich and famous. It mentions a ""jeveve arapy jerére"" (a vivid past experience) and ""heta ñembohupa"" (many stories).  A coctelería (cocktail bar) would be a very typical and fitting place within such a grand, historical hotel where stories would be told and a sense of the past would be cultivated.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Peteĩ restaurante gourmet oĩva upe tendápe (A gourmet restaurant in the hotel):** While possible, it's not as specifically evocative of the atmosphere the passage describes.  A restaurant is common to many hotels.
* **C: Umi irũnguéra oñeipepepirũva ojekuaa porãva térã ikatúva ojekuaa (The guests who were well-dressed or could be well-dressed):** This describes *who* stayed there, not a feature *of* the hotel.
* **D: Umi koty oñembopyahúva nda’aréi ha orekóva tembiporu ko’ag̃aguáva (The rooms that are not comfortable and have old furnishings):** The passage mentions the hotels are ""anticuado"" (antiquated) and lack modern comfort, but emphasizes ""antiguedad elegante"" (elegant antiquity) and *character*. This suggests a deliberate aesthetic, not simply run-down rooms.

**Justificación:**

El texto indica claramente que estos hoteles, aunque con carácter y elegancia, son ""anticuados"" y ""no tienen comodidad moderna"". Esto implica que la opción D, que indica que la comodidad no está presente, es la que mejor refleja la oferta que estos hoteles presentan a sus invitados: una experiencia nostálgica y llena de historia, pero sin las comodidades actuales.

Las otras opciones no son directamente mencionadas en el texto:

*   **A:** Se menciona que tienen muebles antiguos, pero no se centra en ellos como la principal oferta.
*   **B:** No se habla de restaurantes o chefs.
*   **C:** No hay información sobre la calidad de las comidas."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jepe ehenduro ojeipuru pe ñe'ẽ umi Nativo Groenlandia guare, pe jeipuru ndojapóivaerã ambue tapicha okavagua."" This translates to: ""Even though they use the language of the Native Greenlanders, they don't let others use it.""  This directly answers the question of what outsiders aren't allowed to do in Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The text mentions a lack of knowledge about Greenland, not specific things prohibited.
* **B:** This refers to preparing for bad weather, not a prohibition.
* **C:** This refers to potential internet issues, not a restriction on outsiders.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ko’ágã oiko plaza central-ramo ha heta mba’e oiko upépe..."" which translates to ""It is located in the central plaza and many things are found there...""  The text *begins* by describing the Jardín de la Unión and then states it's *in* the central plaza.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe Callejón del Beso:** While described in the text, it's *within* the area surrounding the plaza, not the plaza itself.
* **C: Tupão San Diego-pegua:**  The Templo de San Diego is built *on* the site of the old convent, but the text doesn't say the temple *is* the plaza.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peteĩ mborayhu rembiasakue tuja róga** (A love story legend of a house): While the passage mentions a love story related to the ""Callejón del Beso"", it doesn't say this is what people *don't* avoid in the Jardín de la Unión. It *is* something found *near* the Jardín.
* **C: Umi restaurante henyhẽva yvotyty ijerére** (The restaurants serving juice outside): The passage mentions restaurants, but doesn't say people avoid them.
* **D: Peteĩ óga tuja convento rehegua** (A house related to a convent): The passage states the garden was built on the site of a 17th-century convent *atrio*, but doesn't say people avoid it.

(Families with young children can participate, but a one-day excursion might not be ideal for very young or school-aged children). This directly addresses the suitability of the excursion for families with children.  It acknowledges it *can* be done, but isn't necessarily *best* for all families.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Focuses on the difficulty of the trails, which is mentioned, but isn't the central point of the passage's cautionary note.
* **B:**  Discusses the length of the excursion, but doesn't relate to the family/child consideration.
* **C:**  Mentions the helpfulness of people on the trail, which is a positive aspect, but doesn’t address the suitability for families.



Therefore, option D best captures the essence of the passage regarding the considerations for families participating in this type of hike."

* **The passage focuses on hiking (senderismo) being an activity *within* natural environments (tenda natural-va).**  It highlights enjoying nature and being aware of the surroundings.  The entire description revolves around being *in* a natural setting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oguereko hikuái yvyramáta:** While the *vidde* (plateaus) generally have a connection to the landscape, the specific detail about Rogaland and Agder is the heather.
*   **B: Ndaipóri umi fiordos:** The text *starts* by describing Norway's steep fjords, so fjords *do* exist in Norway.
*   **C: Umi meseta hetave oĩ peteĩchapávante:** The text doesn't specify anything about how many plateaus there are.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’emo’ãi típico Noruega-pe g̃uarã?","The correct answer is **D: Umi páramo**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""hei"" (the plateaus in Rogaland and Agder) are described as *páramos* - a specific type of high, barren plateau often covered in heather.  The text contrasts this with the more *typical* Norwegian landscape of steep fjords and valleys.  The phrasing highlights that ""hei"" are a distinct feature *within* Norway, but not representative of the whole country's landscape in the same way fjords are.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yvy jepyso inandipáva (Low-lying land):** The text emphasizes *high* plateaus (""meseta yvate""), not low-lying land.
* **B: Mesetakuéra ika’aguy hetáva (Plateaus with varying stories):** While the plateaus might have ""stories,"" the text doesn't focus on this. It focuses on *what they are* (páramos) and how they differ from typical Norwegian landscapes.
* **C: Fiordo ijyvatéva (Steep fjords):** The text explicitly *mentions* fjords as a *typical* feature of Norway.  The question asks for something that is *not* typical.

Araka'épa umi turista oñeinteresáva esqui rehe ohova'erã umi yvytýpe?,"The correct answer is **A: Araro’y jave**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...oĩ heta yvytyty rehegua estación-kuéra og̃uahẽhápe nieve hesãiva hetaiterei ha oikuaveẽ jejaporã esquí ha snowboard.""  This translates to ""...there are many mountain stations that are visited with a lot of snow and people enjoy skiing and snowboarding.""
* **""Araro'y jave""** means ""in winter"".  Winter is the season when there's snow, making it the time tourists interested in skiing would go to the mountains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Temporada yvate aja (High season):** While high season might *include* winter, the passage specifically links skiing to *snow*, not just being a busy time.
* **C: Indio arahaku’aja (Indian summer):** This refers to a warm, dry period *after* the usual cool season - the opposite of what you'd need for skiing.
* **D: Arapoty aja (Spring):**  Spring is when snow melts, not when it's ideal for skiing.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, araka’épa oĩ hetavéjepi turista-kuéra umi estación yvytypeguápe?","The correct answer is **D: Umi jasy araro’y aja pukukue** (During the months of snow).

Here's why:

* **The question asks *when* there are a lot of tourists at the mountain stations.** The passage states ""oĩ heta yvytyty rehegua estación-kuéra og̃uahẽhápe nieve hesãiva hetaiterei"" - ""there are many mountain stations where a lot of snow falls"".  This directly links the high tourist numbers to the presence of snow, which happens during the snowy months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi yrypy’aku’i oĩ hetave jave** (There are a lot of waterfalls) - The passage doesn't mention waterfalls.
* **B: Pe snowboard temporada pukukue javeve** (During the snowboard season) - While snowboarding is *an activity* at these stations, the question asks *when* the stations are busy, not specifically about the snowboarding season.
* **C: Indio arahaku’aja** (Indian summer) -  This is the opposite of what the passage describes - it mentions snow, not warm weather.

Mbaʼépa nderejapoiva’erã rehaʼarõramo retopa peteĩ yga nepytyvõkuaáva?,"The correct answer is **A: Jeguata yvate ha yvýre umi muelle-pe** (Walk high and low on the docks).

Here's why:

The passage describes someone arriving at a marina and needing to find help. It specifically mentions looking around the docks (""eikundaha umi muelle-hárupi"") and observing people working with boats (""umi tapicha omopotĩva yjygarata"") and sailors (""umi marinero-kuéra"").  The passage emphasizes observing and being aware of your surroundings to find assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñemoangirũ umi capitán rehe** (Inquire about the captains) - While talking to captains *might* be helpful, the passage doesn't focus on that specifically. It's about initial observation.
* **C: Eñemoherakuãvo umi servicio-kuéra** (Use the services) - This doesn't address the initial need to *find* help.
* **D: Emboykévo hapicha autoestopista ygaratepegua** (Hitchhike with auto-stoppers) - This is a misinterpretation and irrelevant to the context of a marina.



"
Mba’épa rejapova’erã umi puerto deportivo jerére rehekávo peteĩ yga oikotevẽva pytyvõ?,"The correct answer is **A: Eñe’ẽ umi marinero ndive** (Talk to the sailors).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""eñomongetase katui umi marinero-kuéra ndive bar-hárupi"" (talk to the sailors at the bar).  The whole scenario describes needing help navigating and understanding the harbor, and the sailors are presented as a source of that information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Epyta radar guýpe** (Use radar) - The passage doesn't mention anything about radar or technical equipment. It focuses on *people* as a source of help.
* **C: Eñembojánte tapichakuérare omopotĩ aja ijyga** (Trick people into giving you a ride) - The passage describes *receiving* rides from hitchhikers, not trying to trick people.  The tone also suggests needing help, not exploiting others.
* **D: Ejehekýi umi tapicha autoestopista-gui** (Wait for hitchhikers) - This is what *happens* to the narrator, it's not a solution to the problem of navigating the harbor.



"
Mba'e tenda oguerohorýta peteĩ turista ointeresáva chupe pe isla tembiasakue colonialva?,"La respuesta correcta es **B: Kowloon paseo marítimo**.

**Explicación:**

El texto menciona específicamente que para tener una buena vista de Hong Kong, se debe ir a la isla y luego al paseo marítimo de Kowloon, que ofrece una vista del puerto de Victoria y de la ciudad.  Esto indica que el paseo marítimo de Kowloon es un lugar de interés turístico para obtener una perspectiva de la isla y su historia colonial.

Las otras opciones son incorrectas porque:

*   **A: Pe Costa Norte:** El texto menciona la costa norte como área de desarrollo urbano recuperada, pero no como un punto turístico de interés para entender la historia colonial.
*   **C: Hong Kong táva mbytépe:** Aunque Hong Kong en sí es de interés, el texto se enfoca en la isla y el paseo marítimo como lugares específicos para apreciar la historia.
*   **D: Puerto Victoria:** El puerto de Victoria es mencionado, pero como algo que se observa *desde* el paseo marítimo de Kowloon, no como el punto de interés en sí mismo."
Mbaʼe tendápa oguerohorýta peteĩ turista omotenondéva umi jehechapyrã iporãitereíva?,"The correct answer is **C: Hong Kong isla-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ojehechaporãve hag̃ua Hong Kong, esẽ pe isla-gui haeho Kowloon paseo marítimo oĩva henondépe."" This translates to ""To see Hong Kong, go to the island and look at the Kowloon promenade that is opposite.""  The text specifically highlights the island as the best place to *see* Hong Kong and its beautiful sights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Puerto Victoria:** While mentioned as being overlooked by buildings, it's not presented as the place to *experience* Hong Kong.
*   **B: Hong Kong -etépevoi:** This is too broad. The text focuses on the island specifically.
*   **D: Kowloon paseo marítimo:** This is a good *viewpoint* *of* Hong Kong, but the text suggests going *to* the island *to* see Hong Kong.

Mbaʼépa oreko umi sillín oipytyvõva omomichĩ hag̃ua pe riesgo peteĩ jinete py opa’ãrõ g̃uarã peteĩ estribo-pe?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi ñeñangarekorã barra** (The safety bars).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ombosa'ive haguã upe riesgo, ikatu ojejesareko ambue ñeñangarekorã rehe. Peteĩhápe, hetave jinete-kuéra oiporu bota de montar peteĩ tacón ha peteĩ suela lisa ha ipo'íva.

This translates to: ""To reduce that risk, other safety features can be used. For example, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, low sole. However, there are other saddles, such as English saddles, which have safety bars that prevent a rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup.""

The passage explicitly states that the *safety bars* on English saddles help prevent a rider's foot from getting caught in the stirrup, thus reducing the risk of falling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umi suela ipo'íva** (Low soles) - While low soles are mentioned, they are part of the *boots* the rider wears, not a feature of the saddle itself.
*   **C: Estribo cuero-guiguáva** (Leather stirrups) - The material of the stirrup isn’t what provides the safety feature.
*   **D: Tuichavéva estabilidad** (Increased stability) - While saddles do offer stability, this isn't the specific feature mentioned as *reducing the risk of falling through the stirrup*.



"
Mba’emba’épa peteĩ bota de montar-pe oipytyvõva isegurove hag̃ua pe jinete-pe oiporúvo umi estribo?,"The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ suela ikorócho ha ipo'íva** (A smooth and small sole).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""hetave jinete-kuéra oiporu bota de montar peteĩ tacón ha peteĩ suela lisa ha ipo'íva."" (many riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth and small sole).  This is the feature that helps secure the foot in the stirrup and prevents it from slipping through.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pirekue** (Shoulder) - Irrelevant to boots or stirrups.
* **C: Peteĩ pyta** (A branch) -  Completely unrelated.
* **D: Peteĩ suela tuicháva** (A thick sole) - A thick sole wouldn't help with secure footing *in* the stirrup; a thinner, smoother sole is preferable.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the hospitality exchange network *connects travelers with locals offering lodging*. This is the core function described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alojamiento óga jarakuéra uperupigua ndive** - While lodging *is* provided, it's not simply a list of houses, but a *connection* to people offering it.
* **B: Jeveve hapy sa'íva** - This refers to the origin story of Couchsurfing (Casey Fenton's trip to Iceland) and isn't what the network *offers* travelers.
* **C: Umi tour ome'ẽva umi guía upe tendapegua** - The passage doesn't mention tours or guides. It focuses on *accommodation*.

* **The text states:** ""Ejoaju haguã peteĩ red ko'ãichaguáre tekotevẽ emyanyhe peteĩ formulario on line; oĩramo jepe ambue red oikotevẽvéva jesareko rehe.""  This translates to ""To join a network like this, you must fill out an online form; or even other networks may need to verify you.""  This directly supports the idea that some networks have extra verification steps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text says travelers *give* references *for* hosts, not the other way around.
* **C:** The text doesn't mention travelers receiving a discount based on the size of the city.
* **D:** While information about host homes is available, the text doesn't say travelers are *given* this information proactively. They get a list of potential homes after filling out a form.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’eichagua huésped sa’ive ojejuhu peteĩ koty albergue compartido-peguápe?","The correct answer is **D: Peteĩ huésped orekóva treinta áño mbytépe** (A guest who is over thirty years old).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states the hostel attracts a lot of young people, *but* also attracts travelers of various ages. It specifically mentions a guest with ""hetave pokõi arýgui"" (many grey hairs), implying they are older.
* **Q (the question)** asks how a guest might *fit in* (sa’ive ojejuhu) a shared hostel room. The passage contrasts the young crowd with an older traveler.
* Options A, B, and C all focus on duration of stay or traveling with children, which aren't the point of the passage. Option D highlights the age difference, which *is* relevant given the passage's description.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa oiméne ikatuve opyta peteĩ albergue-pe?","The question asks who is allowed to stay at the hostel based on the provided text (P). Let's break down the text:

* **""Alberguekuéra oñangarekove mitã pyahúre...""** - Hostels welcome young children.
* **""...peteĩ huésped jepiverõguáva oguereko hetave pokõi arýgui...""** - A guest with many gray hairs (older person) is also welcome.
* **""...katu py'ỹi avei ejuhukuaa viejero ijary hetavéva.""** -  Even a traveler with a lot of experience is welcome.
* **""Ogayguakuéra mitãre ndojehechaguasúi...""** - They don't mind children.
* **""...katu oĩ albergue omboejéva koty privado-vape.""** - But some hostels offer private rooms.

This shows the hostel welcomes people of *all* ages and experiences – children, older people, experienced travelers.  It doesn't restrict based on family structure.

Now let's look at the options:

* **A: Peteĩ ojohogaygua oviajava peteĩ mitã heñói ramóva ndive** - A single person traveling with a newborn baby.  This fits the description of welcoming children and all types of travelers.
* **B: Mbohapy mitãrusu 22 ary orekóva oviajava oñondive** - Three toddlers aged 22 (presumably meant to be months) traveling together. This fits the description as it involves young children.
* **C: Peteĩ pareja orekóva 70 ary** - A couple aged 70. This fits the description of welcoming older people.
* **D: Mokõi familia oviajava imembykuéra ndive** - Two families traveling with their children. This also fits the description as it includes children and families.

Because the text states the hostel welcomes *everyone*, **all of the options are technically acceptable**. However, the most direct answer based on the *multiple* inclusions mentioned in the text is **A**. It includes both a solo traveler *and* a very young child, hitting two of the specific examples given.



Therefore, the best answer is **A**.

* **The passage states:** ""Reikuaaséramo mba'éichapa ojepoi boomerang ou jeýva nde pópe, ehecha va'erã reguerekópa boomerang ou jeykuaáva.""  This translates to ""It's interesting how a boomerang is thrown and returns to your hand, watch how the boomerang returns.""  This directly relates to the question of how the boomerang's return is described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oguerohoryve umi tavayguakuéra upepeguavoi umi turista-gui** - This talks about local people and tourists, not the boomerang's behavior.
* **C: Ndaipóri heta boomerang ojeguerekóva Australia-pe** -  The passage states the *opposite* - that many boomerangs are found in Australia.
* **D: Oĩnte boomerang-kuéra ikatúva ojevy** - The passage doesn't focus on whether all boomerangs can return, but *how* they return.

Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ojepuruve tembi’u javanesa-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Asuka mbokajaguigua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Especialmente hína mbokaja asuka javanés"" which translates to ""Especially Javanese asuka with peanuts"".  ""Mbokaja"" means peanuts in Guarani. Therefore, *asuka mbokajaguigua* (peanut asuka) is a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asuka morotĩ:** The text doesn't mention ""morotĩ"" (red) as a type of asuka.
*   **B: Asuka en polvo:** While spices are mentioned, the text specifically highlights peanuts, not powdered asuka.
*   **D: Asuka hũ:**  The text doesn't mention ""hũ"" (yellow) as a type of asuka.

* **A: Tapichakuéra oguerekóva mba’asy rupive** (Through people having a disease) - While people *have* the disease, they aren't the *cause* of it starting.
* **C: Bacteria rupive** (Through bacteria) - Bacteria is *a type* of pathogen, but the text refers to pathogens generally.
* **D: Vacuna rupive** (Through vaccine) - Vaccines *prevent* disease, they don't cause it to start.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼépa ndojekuaái omyeñoiha peteĩ mbaʼasy infeccioso?","The correct answer is **A: Vacuna rupive** (With a vaccine).

Here's why:

The text states that many countries *require* vaccines for visitors arriving from or departing to/from areas with many diseases. This implies vaccines are used to *prevent* infectious diseases.  The question asks what prevents an infectious disease, and the text directly links vaccines to prevention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Virus-kuéra (Viruses):** Viruses *cause* infectious diseases, they don't prevent them.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how a user can tell a web proxy is a VPN.** The text states a key difference: ""ombohapepaite Internet tráfico"" (it shapes Internet traffic) - meaning it handles *all* your internet traffic, not just HTTP. This is a defining characteristic of a VPN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Puruhára ojehekýi hag̃ua censura poítica ha ojeikeve pype oñema'ẽ haguã** (The user tries to avoid political censorship and wants to be able to access it) - While VPNs *can* help with this, it doesn't *identify* a VPN from a web proxy.  Both can be used for this purpose.

* **D: Pe puruhára rembiapo oikotevẽ  peteĩ ancho de banda tuichavéva ha peteĩ kuave'ẽmby iporãvéva** (The user's work needs a large bandwidth and a good connection) -  Bandwidth and connection speed are important for *using* a VPN, but they don’t help you *identify* if something *is* a VPN.

This directly translates to ""Those who communicate using the Internet, do not need to use a telephone network that is far away or nearby.""

* **B: Umi papapy pumbyry global rehegua** (Global roaming papers) - While mentioned, these are a potential solution *if* someone is in a remote area, not a general requirement for communication.

The passage states: ""Natekotevẽi ojeiporu peteĩ telefonía ñemuha oĩva reikohápe térã rehohápe."" This directly translates to ""You need to use a telephony system located at the location or nearby.""  The passage describes needing to connect remotely and mentions various options (satellite internet, a base in Arizona) *to facilitate* using this local telephony system.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:**  The pronunciation changes depending on the following letter. For example, ""caro"" (expensive) vs. ""carro"" (wagon) – the 'r' sound is different depending on what comes after it.  This means the spelling stays the same, but the *pronunciation* changes based on the following letter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ r doble oñembohyapu ambue peteĩ r simple-gui** (A double 'r' is replaced with a single 'r') - This isn't what the passage says. It talks about *how* the 'r' is pronounced, not replaced.
* **B: Hetave ñe’ẽ oñembohyapu pe ojehaiháicha** (Many words are pronounced as they are written) - The passage directly contradicts this; it *highlights* words that *aren't* pronounced as written.
* **C: Umi ñe’ẽ orekóva tai c ha g ikatu ijetuʼu** (Words with 'c' and 'g' can be lengthened) - While 'c' and 'g' are mentioned as having different pronunciations, this isn't the central point of the passage.  The focus is on how pronunciation depends on the letter that follows.

This directly relates to the modern characteristics of Izmir that are being highlighted.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Bulevar kakua:** While boulevards are *mentioned* as a feature, they don't define the overall characteristic the text is highlighting.
*   **B: Umi oga’yvate orekóva vidrio henondépe:**  The tall buildings with glass are also a *feature*, but not the main defining characteristic.
*   **D: Umi ogahoja oguerekóva teja pytã:** These buildings are historical and while important, don’t represent the current vibrant feel of the city.

The boulevards are wide, the buildings are glass-fronted and the modern squares have terracotta tiles..."" and mentions old mosques and churches.  This means you can find both modern squares *and* ancient religious buildings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko táva ojere peteĩ ypa tuicháva rehe (The city faces a large river):** The text says it faces a bay (""bahía tuichaitereíva"") not a river.
* **B: Pe tekoha ohechauka Turquía ymaguare (The environment shows ancient Turkey):** While it *has* ancient elements, the passage also states it has a European Mediterranean atmosphere, implying it isn't solely representative of ancient Turkey.
* **D: Oguereko mokõiha puerto tuichavéva Turquía-pegua (It has the second largest port in Turkey):** The text states it's the *second* largest port *after* Istanbul, but doesn't say it's the only one or that it’s a defining characteristic that isn't about Izmir itself.



"
Pe ñe’ẽ hanami oñe’ẽ mba’e ojehecha hag̃ua rehe?,"The correct answer is **A: Cerezo poty**.

Here's why:

The text states ""ojekuaáva hanami ramo, ha’e ymaite guive Japón arandupy siglo VIII-guive"" which translates to ""when enjoying hanami, it dates back to Japan's culture since the 8th century.""  And then it connects hanami to the viewing of cherry blossoms (cerezo poty).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aristocracia Japón-gua:** While the aristocracy *enjoyed* hanami, hanami itself isn't *about* the aristocracy.
*   **C: Ciruelo poty:** The text says the concept *originated* with plum blossoms in China, but hanami in Japan is about cherry blossoms.

Mávapa omotenonde umi vy’aguasu tenonderãitegua ojehecha hag̃ua cerezo poty?,"The correct answer is **B: Umi aristócrata Japón-gua** (The Japanese aristocrats).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Japón-pe, umi vy’arenda cerezo poty rehegua ombosako’iva’ekue emperador, ima’erãite ha ambue hapichakuéra aristocracia-pegua Corte Imperial-gua.""  This translates to: ""In Japan, those who appreciated cherry blossoms included the emperor and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.""

Therefore, the passage directly identifies the Japanese aristocracy as the group who greatly enjoyed viewing the cherry blossoms.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼã mbaʼe Jerusalén rehegua saʼive ogueraháva turismo?","The correct answer is **D: Umi heta tenda tembiasakue rapykueréva** (The many tourist attractions it has).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jerusalén oĩ destino turístico principal-ramo Israel-pe."" (Jerusalem is the main tourist destination in Israel.) and then goes on to list its historical, archaeological, and cultural sites, commercial centers, cafes and restaurants. This directly implies tourism is driven by the *attractions* Jerusalem offers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe táva he’iséva jeroviapy ryepýpe** (The city being located in the Holy Land) - While true, being *in* the Holy Land doesn't automatically guarantee tourism. It's *what's in* the city that draws people.
* **B: Iñemohenda ha'eha Israel tavaguasu** (It's recognized as Israel's capital) -  Political recognition is a factor, but not the primary driver of tourism as detailed in the text.
* **C: Umi oferta cultural orekóva** (The cultural offers it has) - While culture *contributes* to tourism, the passage lists a much broader range of attractions beyond just culture (historical sites, archaeology, commerce, etc.).  Option D is more comprehensive.



"
Mávarepa ko’ãva apytégui noñeñe’ẽi pe pehẽnguépe peteĩ mba’e ojekuaaveha Jerusalén-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Jeroviapýpe g̃uarã he’iséva** (Because of its religious importance).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily emphasizes Jerusalén's significance as a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.** It's described as a central spiritual, religious, and cultural hub.  The question asks *why* people visit Jerusalem.  The passage points directly to its religious importance as the primary reason.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tembiasakue ojehecharamoitereíva (Important historical events):** While Jerusalén *has* historical events, the passage prioritizes its religious role.
* **B: Influencia política rupive (Political influence):** The passage doesn't focus on political reasons for visiting.
* **D: Umi tenda tekoha rehegua (Local customs):** While Jerusalén undoubtedly has local customs, the passage doesn't highlight this as a main draw for visitors.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ikatúva ojeiporu ojeike hag̃ua paque Sudáfrica-pegua ojeiporavóva térã opava Parque Nacional Sudáfrica-peguápe."" This translates to ""...it can be used to enter parks in South Africa that are visited or any South African National Park.""  

This implies the Wild Card is most beneficial for someone planning to visit *multiple* parks, not just one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the Wild Card *can* be used at Kruger, the text doesn't say it's specifically beneficial *only* for visiting Kruger for a night.
* **C:**  Being young or interested in park discounts isn't mentioned as a reason to get a Wild Card.
* **D:**  Visiting Kruger *and* another park is a possibility, but the text emphasizes the benefit of visiting *multiple* parks, making A a more complete answer.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kóva hína peteĩva umi ojehecharamovéva Sudáfricape"" which translates to ""This is one of the most famous in South Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi mymba ka'aguy iñambue heta ecozona parque-pegua apytépe** (Many unique animal species in various ecozones within the park): While true, this is a *description* of the park, not a key identifying fact in the passage.
* **C: Ha'e pe parque michĩvéva umi Parque Nacional Sudáfrica-pegua apytépe** (It is the largest of the South African National Parks): The text doesn't claim it's the *largest*, just that it's important and part of SANParks.
* **D: Ojeikekuaa ojejoguávo Wild Card** (It is possible to use a Wild Card to enter): This is about *access* to the park, not what *identifies* the park itself.

The passage explicitly states: ""Oĩ peteĩ itakua michimi yvate ojahasa va’erãhárupi, ikarape ha nda’ipeiete."" (There is a high, narrow ravine that appears to drop off, steep and without protection.)  This directly indicates a danger to climbers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He’õjave (The heat):** While the passage mentions it's tiring, heat isn't presented as a primary danger.
* **B: Tape itaguigua (Steep path):**  Steepness is a challenge, but the passage focuses on the *lack of protection* alongside the steepness.
* **D: Umi cable acero-guigua (The steel cables):** The cables are *used for safety* (to help you go up), not a source of danger.

This translates to: ""Therefore, it is recommended to be careful when climbing the stairs, and even though it is a short climb, there is some danger.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi jupihára ikatupyrýva jepe oiméne ipytupátavaicha** - The passage doesn't talk about the physical condition of climbers.
* **B: Ndaipóri jejokoha umi tenda hasyvehápe ojejupi hag̃ua** - The passage *does* describe the stairs and cable used for climbing.
* **C: Rehasavaʼerã peteĩ itakuárupi oĩva yvate gotyo** - While the passage mentions a steep cliff (""Oĩ peteĩ itakua michimi yvate ojahasa va’erãhárupi""), this isn't the main point about making the climb difficult or dangerous.

The passage states that ""Pa amb Oli"" (bread with olive oil) can be topped with ""tomate ha ambue mba’e ojeguerekóva, taha’e kesu, atún..."" which translates to ""tomato and other things you like, such as cheese, tuna..."".  This clearly indicates a variety of toppings are used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: So’o (Meat):** While tuna (atún) is a meat, the passage mentions other things *besides* just meat.
* **B: Mbujape (Mushrooms):** Mushrooms aren’t mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Verdura-kuéra (Vegetables):** While vegetables (like tomato) are mentioned, it also explicitly says ""ambue mba’e"" (other things), meaning it's not limited to just vegetables.

Here's why:

The question asks what is *not* a common characteristic of a Hangi. Options A, B, and D all describe things explicitly mentioned in the text as being related to Hangi:

* **A:** Geothermal hangi uses a well filled with water for cooking.
* **B:** Hangi can be found and demonstrated in Wellington.
* **D:** Rotorua is known for its geothermal hangi.

However, the text states Hangi is used to prepare a ""festive-style meal"" (cena jepiverõguáicha ñembichy estilo-pe), *not* that it *is* a festive-style meal itself.  The hangi is the *method* of cooking, resulting in such a meal.  Therefore, option C is what the text doesn't describe as a direct attribute of the hangi itself.



"
Mávapa ko’ã mba’e apytégui ndoje’éi ha’eha peteĩ forma típica oñembyaku hag̃ua pe Hangi pit?,"The correct answer is **C: Mba’eraku geotérmica** (Geothermal steam).

This translates to ""The well brings water up from below, or in some places the geometric structure is used to bring the underground heat to the surface."" This indicates geothermal heat is the source.
* **The text further mentions:** ""Hangi ojeiporu jepi oñembojy haguã peteĩ cena jepiverõguáicha ñembichy estilo-pe."" (""Hangi is used to cook a delicious meal in a traditional style."") and ""Heta tenda oĩva Rotorua-pe oikuave'ẽ hangi geotérmico..."" (""Many places in Rotorua showcase geothermal hangi..."") reinforcing the link to geothermal activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gas** - While gas *could* be involved in geothermal systems, it's not the primary cooking element described. The focus is on the heat.
* **B & D: Ita hakúva** (Hot water) - Hot water is *present*, but it's the heat *from* the geothermal source (steam) that's used for cooking, not just the water itself.  The water is a carrier for the heat.



Therefore, **geothermal steam (mba’eraku geotérmica)** is the fundamental element enabling the hangi to be cooked in this manner."
Mba’épa ikatúne peteĩ monje térã monja jehechakuaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Emondévo peteĩ ao ojejaho’i verapáva** (They show a habit of offering a gift truthfully).

Here's why:

The passage describes monasteries where women offer gifts (puku) and their virtues. It specifically mentions that the monks/nuns *recognize* these women even if they are poor, and appreciate their offerings. The passage strongly implies the monks/nuns can discern sincerity and virtue in the offerings.  Therefore, recognizing a truthful offering is a key characteristic of what a monk/nun would observe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ejaho’ivo nde ati’y** (Don't reveal your virtue) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **C: Eiporúvo peteĩ ao monasterio-gui** (Using a gift from the monastery) -  The passage focuses on gifts *to* the monastery, not taking from it.
* **D: Emonde peteĩ sái oñeikytĩva tetymy’ã ári rupi** (Seeing a stain on the ground) - This is irrelevant to the context of the passage and the monks/nuns' observations.

(there are many rosaries among the novices!).  The passage is discussing the use of rosaries within the monastery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saikuéra** - This means ""rings"" and isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Kasõmbyky** - This means ""comb"" and isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Aho’iha** - This means ""to announce/tell"" and isn't a physical object.

* **The passage states:** ""...contaminación lumínica nda’éi jepi apañuãi, avei ikatúta ohecha porãmi mbyjakuéra"" which translates to ""...light pollution doesn't bother much, and you can also see stars well.""  This directly explains *why* a visitor would have a good opportunity to see stars in Antarctica – because there's little to no light pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arahaku jave (Because it's daytime):** The passage mentions the sun not rising above the horizon (""kuarahy ndojupíriha horizonte ári""), implying darkness, not daytime.
* **B: Pe tendápe ndojeikoguasúi jave (Because there aren't many people at the camp):** While the passage mentions few people, this doesn't relate to seeing stars.
* **C: Araro’y jave (Because it's cold):**  While the regions are cold, the cold itself isn't the reason for good stargazing.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that a satellite signal needs a clear view (""aire libre-hápe peteĩ jehecha porãme"") to communicate with the satellite.  If the signal is blocked, the satellite cannot establish a connection.  The question asks *why* a satellite might not be able to communicate with a buoy.  A blocked line of sight is the direct reason given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe tenda oĩramo mombyryeterei** (Even if the tent is covered) - While the text mentions a tent, the issue isn't *just* the tent, but the blockage of the signal.
* **C: Ojeiporútaramo okápe** (If it's not used there) - This is irrelevant to the ability of the satellite to communicate.
* **D: Peteĩ expedición oikotevẽramo datos** (If an expedition needs data) - Expeditions are mentioned, but are not the reason for communication failure.

(Those with limited coverage, a satellite phone could be the solution.) This directly connects the need for coverage in areas with limited signal to the benefit of a satellite phone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojepytu’u aja peteĩ távape:** (Just needing to be in a city) The passage discusses situations *without* city coverage.
* **B: Peteĩ viaje ojejapo aja ygápe:** (Just making a trip to the water) While the passage mentions maritime transport, it doesn't limit the usefulness of satellite phones to just being on the water.
* **C: Natekotevẽi jave umi dato mombyrygua:** (Not needing limited data) The passage implies needing data *despite* limited connectivity, making a satellite phone helpful.

The text states: ""1994-pe ko apañuãi rupi oñemoheñói ijeheguieténte ojeherova República de Transnistria, Moldovia este gotyo, oguerekóva ipokatu ha **ivirutee**..."" This translates to ""In 1994, as a result of this conflict, it was proclaimed independent under the name República de Transnistria, Moldovia remains, having its territory and **virutee** (rights/sovereignty)..."".

The conflict (apañuãi) led to the proclamation of Transnistria and a dispute over territory and sovereignty.  Therefore, the conflict was about rights/sovereignty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ava’atypy (Population):** While the text mentions Moldova being multiethnic, the conflict's origin isn't directly tied to population demographics in this passage.
*   **C: Ñe’ẽ (Language):** Language (Romanian and Russian) is mentioned, but isn't the central reason for the conflict.
*   **D: Jeroviapy (Religion):** Religion is mentioned as a characteristic of Moldova, but isn’t the core issue causing the creation of Transnistria.

The text states: ""...oguerekóva ipokatu ha ivirutee, hakatu noñemoneĩri gueteri ni peteĩ tetãrehe ONU pegua rehe."" This translates to ""...it has a territory and a government, but it is not recognized by any country in the UN.""  This is the key characteristic explaining its situation regarding Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñe’ẽ (Language):** While language is mentioned (Romanian and Russian), it doesn't explain Transnistria's separation.
* **B: Jeroviapy (Religion):**  Religion (Orthodox Christianity) is a cultural aspect of Moldova, not a reason for Transnistria's claim to independence.
* **D: Virutee (Government):**  Having a government doesn't explain *why* it's a disputed territory; it's a *result* of the claim.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Montevideo oĩ rupi sur gotyo Ecuador-gui, upépe arahaku ro’y jave hemisferio norte-pe ha ambue hendáicha.""  This translates to ""Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's summer in the northern hemisphere, it's winter there.""

The question asks when a traveler should *not* visit Montevideo to avoid the cold. The text directly links summer in the Northern Hemisphere to winter (cold) in Montevideo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hemisferio Norte gotyo araro'y jave** (When it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere) - This would be the *best* time to visit for warm weather.
*   **B: Montevideo hi’arajere seca jave** (When Montevideo has a dry season) - The text doesn't mention a dry season.
*   **D: Montevideo-pe ro'y jave** (When it's hot in Montevideo) - This is when a traveler *would* want to visit.

* **The text describes Montevideo's summer climate:**  It mentions subtropical conditions and high temperatures, indicating a summer experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oguahẽvo arahaku Hemisferio Norte-pe** (Traveling to the Northern Hemisphere in summer) - The text focuses on *Montevideo* and its climate, not traveling to the Northern Hemisphere.
* **C: Oguahẽvo Montevideo-pe oky jave** (Traveling to Montevideo in winter) -  The text clearly states it's *summer* in Montevideo when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
* **D: Oguahẽvo ro'y Hemisferio Norte-pe** (Traveling to the summer of the Northern Hemisphere) - Again, this is about the Northern Hemisphere, not about Montevideo specifically.

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts illegal graffiti (vandalism) with ""legal"" graffiti.** It states that even though graffiti started as something seen as vandalism, there's now a distinction made between it and art done with permission (""graffiti oikóva umi pered """"legalva"""" rehe"").
* **The question asks how one can distinguish an artist doing graffiti from someone committing vandalism.** The passage implies this is done by *what is done* – whether it’s done with permission and within a legal context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojehaívo garabato-kuéra (They call them doodles)** - This is a description of the initial perception of graffiti, not how to distinguish between art and vandalism.
* **C: Mural ndojeipotáiva tenda público-pe (Murals are not done on public property)** - This isn't true according to the passage; the issue is *how* they're done (with or without permission).
* **D: Umi etiqueta noñemoñe’ẽporãiva (The labels aren’t well-defined)** - The passage actually suggests the opposite - that a distinction *is* being made through labeling (""legal"" graffiti).

This translates to ""Even if they live far away, they will likely go to have a music camping in the forest.""  The phrase ""eguahẽ va'erã voi"" directly implies a high probability of attendance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojegueraha mitã michĩva** (They bring small children) - The passage mentions a special tent *for* children, not that people *bring* them as a requirement.
* **B: Oñeacampa upe tendápe** (They camp in that tent) - The tent is specifically *for* children, and not necessarily where everyone camps.
* **C: Mba’epu ñembopu pyhare pyte peve** (It doesn't matter if it's very hot) - While the passage mentions performing even in hot weather, it doesn't relate to what people do to prepare to attend the festival.

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ambue jeguerovy'a oguereko tenda especial-va ikatuhápe ojapo camping ogaygua mitãnguéra rehe."" (Another organizer has a special tent where they can camp with their children.)  This directly answers the question of what someone attending the festival can expect if they want to camp with their family.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oho pyhare pyte (They go during the fall):** While the passage mentions performing ""pyhare pyte peve"" (even during the fall), it doesn't say this is what attendees *expect*.
* **C: Oacampa ambue tendápe (They camp in another tent):** The passage doesn't say they camp in a *different* tent, it describes a *specific* tent for families.
* **D: Oñeg̃uahẽ voi (They will come):** This is too general and doesn't address the question about camping facilities.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people (tavakuéra) are drawn to casinos and entertainment in northern New Mexico, and that a significant number of bars in smaller towns cater to travelers passing through. The question asks *why* visitors are drawn to northern New Mexico for a good time.  The passage directly implies it's the people (travelers/visitors) seeking entertainment and opportunities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi bar oĩva táva michĩvévape (Bars in smaller towns):**  The bars *cater to* the visitors, they aren't the reason visitors come.
* **C: Ñemuhaguasukuéra (Smugglers):** The passage mentions smuggling, but doesn't connect it to why visitors come for fun.
* **D: Casino-kuéra (Casinos):** Casinos are *part* of the attraction, but the passage indicates a broader appeal beyond just casinos (entertainment in general).

This translates to ""...and many still have good entertainment (Although many of those are located around Albuquerque and Santa Fe. For example: bars in small towns aren't necessarily a great attraction for visitors from other states passing through).""

The passage specifically mentions bars in small towns as a common stop for visitors in northern New Mexico, despite not being a major attraction.  This aligns perfectly with the question's inquiry about what a visitor might encounter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peteĩ casino-pe mokõi aravo Albuquerque-gui** (A casino two days from Albuquerque) - The passage mentions casinos, but doesn't specify a location or timeframe.
*   **B: Peteĩ táva mombyryguápe** (A small town) - While true, this is too broad. The passage focuses on *what you find* in those small towns (bars).

* **B: Y embotelladova:** The text says bottled beer is *difficult* to find, making this the opposite of a solution to thirst.

* **D: Peteĩ morotĩ plano:**  ""Morotĩ plano"" (flat white) is mentioned as something *they don't serve* in Australia.

"Ojepysóva mbohapy siglo pukukue, mba'e aty omoñepyrũva’ekue pe periodo de colonización?","The correct answer is **D: Umi España-gua** (The Spanish).

Here's why:

The text states: ""España-guakuéra omoñepyrũ pe procesode colonización ipukúva tres siglos."" This directly translates to ""The Spanish started the colonization process that lasted three centuries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umi Pajagua** - The text mentions the Payagua as an indigenous group *living* in the Chaco region, not as initiators of colonization.
*   **B: Umi Guaikuru** - Similar to the Payagua, the Guaikuru are described as an indigenous group.
*   **C: Umi Guarani** - The Guarani are described as a large indigenous group inhabiting the region, but not as the ones *beginning* the colonization.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼéicha ikatu ojejapo peteĩ parisino pya’e ojepokuaa hag̃ua nderehe?","The correct answer is **C: Eikokuaa jepoyhúpe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...eikova’erã jepoyhu ha py’aguapýpe, ( ojehekombo’eporãva)."" which translates to ""...they will recognize you with a glance and with kindness (making you feel welcome).""  This directly relates to being recognized in public.
* **The question asks:** How can a Parisian easily be recognized as not being from there? The passage implies Parisians will *notice* someone who doesn't fit in, and will likely do so with a look (jepoyhu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eñeha’ã umi Paris-gua reko:**  ""Try to act like Parisians."" This isn't what the passage suggests they *will* do to recognize a non-Parisian.
* **B: Ejeroviaukava’erã ndejehe:** ""They will judge your clothes."" While style is important in Paris, the passage doesn't focus on clothing.
* **D: Ehechauka nderoryha opavavéndi:** ""They will watch your behavior everywhere."" While Parisians are observant, the passage specifically mentions recognition through a look, not constant surveillance.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui noñeconsiderái cualidad estereotipada umi Paris-gua rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Tie’ỹreko**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Parisians as being considered stylish and well-dressed (""itie’ỹ ha ijejapo""). It then contrasts this with the fact that despite this stereotype, Parisians are also portrayed as being unfriendly and snobbish (""eikova’erã jepoyhu ha py’aguapýpe""). The question asks what quality *doesn't* fit the stereotype.  Being stylish (""tie’ỹreko"") *is* the stereotype, so it's the quality they *do* consider. The other options (jejapo - well-made, tory - which doesn't translate well and isn't relevant, jehechakuaa - to know) are related to the *contrast* to the stereotype.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical answer.



"
Mba’épa peteĩ beneficio First Class rehegua ome’ẽva MetroRail Cabo távapegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Pe autocar oĩ pe tren renondépe** (The bus is on the train route).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""autocar-kuéra akóinte oĩ tren hiaguĩvéva Cábo tévagui ruguápe"" which translates to ""Buses also follow the train route to Cape Town."" This means a benefit of the First Class (MetroPlus) is access to transportation even if the train is full or unavailable, as buses run the same route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndahetaitereíri tapicha** (There are no people) - The passage says MetroPlus *has* many people, so this is false.
* **C: Ndahepyive peteĩ boleto tercera clase-peguágui** (It’s not cheap with a third-class ticket) - This doesn't relate to a *benefit* of First Class. The passage *does* mention First Class tickets are expensive compared to Europe, but that's a drawback, not a benefit.
* **D: Peteĩ boleto metro-peguáichante ovale** (A ticket with a metro-like shape) - This is irrelevant information not found in the passage.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa oreko opa tren mohi'aguĩva Cabo távapegua?","The correct answer is **C: Mbohapy clase iñambuéva** (Three different classes).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Metrorail oguereko mokõichagua tren mohi'aguĩva Cabo távape ha ijerére; MetroPlus (ojeikuaáva avei First Class-ramo) ha Metro (ojeheróva Third Class-ramo)...""  This directly translates to ""Metrorail has two types of trains running to and from Cape Town; MetroPlus (also known as First Class) and Metro (also known as Third Class).""
* **It also mentions:** ""...Ambue tren-kuéra oguereko vagón-kuéra MetroPlus ha Metro..."" which means other trains also have MetroPlus and Metro carriages.  This implies a differentiation in class.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ vagón Metro-pegua sa'ive henyhẽva (A single Metro carriage is enough)** - This isn't the main point of the text.
* **B: Peteĩchaite boleto repykue mokõive clase-pe g̃uarã (A single ticket is valid for two classes)** -  The text discusses *classes* available, not ticket validity across them.
* **D: Mokõive autocar ha’éva primera ha tercera clase-gua (Two buses, one first and one third class)** - The text talks about trains and mentions buses as a *supplement* to trains, not as the primary types of transport with different classes.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ikatúne ndojapói peteĩ mymba plaga?,"The correct answer is **A: Oporomonguru**.

Here's why:

* **P (the text) describes pests as things you don't see that cause problems.** The passage talks about pests being hidden, causing irritation, allergies, poisoning, and potentially spreading infectious diseases. 
* **The question asks what makes something a pest.**  Something is a pest *because* it causes problems, and the first thing described in the passage is that pests are difficult to detect - they ""ojuhukuaa jepi plaga-kuéra ndojepokuaáiva rehe"" (are found even though the pests aren't seen). ""Oporomonguru"" means ""it hides"" which aligns with this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Omboalergia (It causes allergies):**  Allergies are *a result* of a pest, not what defines it *as* a pest.
* **C: Oñemosarambi peteĩ mba’asy (It causes poisoning):**  Similar to allergies, poisoning is a *consequence* of a pest, not its defining characteristic.
* **D: Oproduci umi lesión ijetu’úva (It produces serious injuries):** This describes a *severe* outcome of *some* pests, but not all pests cause serious injuries.  It's too specific.



"
Moõpa ikatu ojejogua umi pumbyry tarjeta jehepyme’ẽmbyrémava?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi tetã específico-pe** (In specific countries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ojeporúva ome’ẽvo tarifa ñehenóirã umi aty oñemoneĩmbyréva **tetãnguéra hárupi**."" This translates to ""...used to offer tariffs for those implemented in **countries**.""  

This clearly indicates the credit/debit cards are valid or have benefits in *specific countries*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi tren estación-pe** (In train stations) - The passage doesn't mention train stations.
* **C: Umi ñemuha esquina-peguápe** (On street corners) - The passage doesn't mention street corners.
* **D: Umi pumbyry público oĩháme** (In public transport) - While the context *is* about transport (pumbyry = transport), the cards aren't limited to public transport *locations* – their benefit is tied to *countries*.



"
Mba’éichapa ojeiporukuaa umi tasa de llamada omachavéva oikuave’ẽva algunas tarjetas?,"The correct answer is **A: Oĩnte tetã ikatuha ojeiporu** (Some countries allow it).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...oĩ katu ojeporúva ome’ẽvo tarifa ñehenóirã umi aty oñemoneĩmbyréva tetãnguéra hárupi.""  This translates to ""...there are also those that charge fees for the services offered by companies in other countries.""  This directly indicates that some countries *allow* these call charges to be applied.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi papapy reiguáva rupive** (Through the small print): While the passage mentions needing to read the fine print to understand fees, it doesn't explain *why* those fees exist, only that they do.
* **C: Pe ñemuha esquina-peguápe** (At the corner of the store): This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion of international call charges.
* **D: Ojeiporúvo pumbyry público ha ojehepyme’ẽvévo michĩmi** (Using a public phone and making a small payment): This is not mentioned in the text.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko’ã yvyramáta sa’ive ojehecháva pe parque nacional Lagos de Plitvice-pe?","The correct answer is **A: Haya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tetã Rekuái okavusu hérava Lagos de Plitvice oguereko heta yvyraty, **hetave oĩva hayas, abetos ha abetos**..."" 

This translates to: ""The national park called Plitvice Lakes has many forests, **many of them being beech trees (hayas), fir trees and spruces**...""

Therefore, *haya* (beech) is explicitly mentioned as one of the dominant tree types in the park. While *abeto* (fir) is also mentioned, *haya* is the first tree type listed and therefore the most directly answered by the text.



"
Mávapa ko'ã mymba ndahetáiva rehegua apytégui ikatu ojejuhu parque nacional Lagos de Plitvice-pe?,"The correct answer is **D: Urogallo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""urogallo""** as one of the animals you can find in the Lagos de Plitvice National Park.  The text states: ""...ikatu ojejuhu mymba ojehecha’ỹva, taha’e oso pardo europeo, lobo, águila, búho, lince, gato montes **ha urogallo**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Turquía (Turkey)** - While turkeys exist, they are not mentioned in the passage as inhabitants of this park.
* **B: Tejón eíra rehegua (European badger)** -  Badgers are not specifically mentioned in the text.
* **C: Casuario (Cassowary)** - Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea, not Croatia (where Plitvice Lakes is located).



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épe añetehápe oipytyvõ umi tendapegua código?","The correct answer is **D: Copia ilegal**.

Here's why:

The passage states the code is designed so a bit-for-bit copy reveals the device it was copied *from*. This is a method to detect and combat **illegal copies** (copias ilegales). The purpose is to discourage ""piracy"" (piratería) by making it easier to trace the source of the copied material.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Disco jekopiápe (On a copy disc):** While the code relates to copies, the code itself *helps detect* copies, it doesn't reside *on* them.
*   **B: Oñecontrola hag̃ua ñemuha (To control the game):** The code isn't about controlling the game's functionality, but about controlling *copying* of the game.
*   **C: Piratería ojehapejoko hag̃ua (To facilitate piracy):** The code is specifically *against* piracy, not designed to help it.



"
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa ko'ãva apytégui japu umi tendapegua código rehegua ojehejapukúva are guivéma umi empresa momaranduha rupive?","The correct answer is **A: Oñeikotevẽ oñecontrola porãve hag̃ua ñemuha** (They need to better control the software).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the problem of piracy stemming from easily copied code.** The core issue is the *lack of control* over how the software is distributed and used.  The passage highlights that copying is too easy (""bit ha bit rehe ombohasa jeykuaa"") and leads to illegal copies.
* **Option A directly addresses this root problem.** Better control over the software (through licensing, DRM, etc.) would help prevent unauthorized copying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oipytyvõ ani hag̃ua ojejapo copia ilegal (Help to not make illegal copies):** While a good intention, it doesn't address *how* to prevent it.  It's reactive, not proactive.
* **C: Ha’ekuéra ideprovécho pirapire oñembojere hag̃ua (They take advantage of piracy to promote themselves):** The passage doesn't suggest companies *want* piracy; it depicts piracy as a problem *caused by* easily copied code.
* **D: Sa’i oipytyvõ ohapejoko hag̃ua piratería (Little help to promote piracy):** This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The passage is talking about stopping piracy, not encouraging it.



"
"Eg̃uahẽvo ne retãme, mba’e proceso-pa ojejapo vaivaínte?","The most logical answer, based on the prompt, is **D: Aduana-pegua jejesareko**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt directly mentions ""aduana-pegua jejesareko"" (customs controls) as something that *does* exist and can cause problems.** The prompt contrasts this with immigration controls which are either absent or merely a formality.
* The question asks about the *process* someone undergoes when entering the country. Customs controls are a very concrete process someone would experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Umi control inmigración rehegua (Immigration controls):** The prompt states these are weak or non-existent.
* **B: Ojedeclara umi mba’e rehegua (Declaring things):** While related to entry, this is part of *customs* procedures, not a broad process overview.
* **C: Umi límite legal mba’ekuéra rehegua (Legal limits):**  This is too abstract.  The prompt focuses on *what happens* when entering, not the laws themselves.



Therefore, **D** is the best fit as it directly addresses a confirmed and potentially problematic process mentioned in the original statement."
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui reikuaava’erã reg̃uahẽ mboyve ne retãme?,"The best answer is **C: Oĩtapa aduana-pegua jejesareko**.

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) explicitly states:** ""aduan pegua jejesareko ikatu ñanemyangekõi"" (the customs check can help us).  This directly corresponds to option C.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Oĩtapa puesto de control inmigración rehegua** (There is an immigration control post) - The text says immigration control *doesn't* exist or is just a formality.
* **B: Tekotevẽramo emombe’upaite opamba’e mbojojahakuéra ári oĩva** (We must support those who are defending our country) - While potentially a sentiment, this isn’t *information* from the text about what you learn or what helps.
* **D: Oĩpa mba’e noñemoneĩriva umi mbaʼe reguerúva apytépe** (There are things that are not shown in what we carry) - This is a possible inference, but not directly stated in the text.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the information provided in the prompt."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e oĩ hetávapa opermiti umi jupihárape umi tape pyahu jejuhu Cochamó Valle ryepýpe?","The correct answer is **D: Tapiakuéra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jupihára opa tendapeguáva ojapo ohóvo tape pyahu pe tápia opakuaa'ỹva rehe."" This translates to ""All climbers in each valley make paths through the visible terrain."" 

Therefore, the *terrain* (tapiakuéra) is what allows the climbers to create the paths they take in Cochamó Valle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oñemaña hag̃ua:** (To manage) - Doesn't relate to what allows climbers to make paths.
*   **B: Yvytyru’ãnguéra:** (Mountains) - While Cochamó has mountains, the passage specifies the *terrain* is what's being navigated.
*   **C: Umi pico:** (The peaks) -  Peaks are part of the terrain, but not the encompassing factor allowing path creation."
"Oñemopyendáva marandu oñeme'ẽva pe pehẽnguépe rehe, mávapa ocubri hetave cruce Hemisferio Sur-pe?","The correct answer is **A: SkyTeam**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ha SkyTeam nog̃uahẽi ni peteĩ umi cruce-pe"" which translates to ""and SkyTeam does not participate in any of the crossings.""  The question asks which alliance *doesn't* cover many crossings in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, SkyTeam is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Star Aliance:** The text says Star Alliance *does* participate in crossings (to Santiago de Chile and Tahiti).
* **C: Pacífico Sur:** This is a geographic location, not an airline alliance.
* **D: LATAM Oneworld:** This alliance *is* involved in a specific crossing (to Tahiti).



"
Mba'e alianza aerolínea-pa ocubri sa'ive umi cruce océano Hemisferio Sur-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Aliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Aliance aimete og̃uahẽmba, nog̃uahẽi Santiago de Chile este gotyo, Pacífico Sur-pe Tahiti-peve..."" which translates to ""Star Alliance does cover, going from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti in the South Pacific...""  This directly answers the question of which airline alliance covers the South Hemisphere oceanic routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pacífico Sur** - This is a *location* (South Pacific), not an airline alliance.
* **C: LATAM Oneworld** -  While LATAM is part of Oneworld, the text states Oneworld only covers some routes *through* LATAM, not the broad coverage mentioned.
* **D: SkyTeam** - The text explicitly states SkyTeam *does not* cover any of these South Hemisphere oceanic crossings.



"

The text states: ""Global Running Tours omongoviáva, Go Runnig Tours, ojoapýva ambue docena sightrunning me'ẽhára rehe irundy continente-pe."" This means Global Running Tours is owned by Go Running Tours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Running Copenhague-pe:** This is a tour *offered* by Global Running Tours, not the owning organization.
* **C: Tours de carrera Prague-pe:** Similar to A, this is a tour offered, not the owner.
* **D: Tours de carrera Barcelona-pe:** Also a tour offered, not the owner.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Global Running Tours omongoviáva, Go Running Tours, ojoapýva ambue **heta docena** sightrunning me'ẽhára rehe irundy continente-pe."" This translates to ""Global Running Tours owns, Go Running Tours, adding another **dozen** sightrunning guides across three continents.""

Therefore, Go Running Tours is adding a dozen (heta docena) guides.

Mbaʼépa ojapovaʼerã peteĩ turista ohecha porãsevéramo peteĩ guepardo-pe?,"The correct answer is **C: Oiporuva’erã binocular**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""León, guepardo ha leopardo-kuéra sapy'ánte hi'otĩ ha rehecha porãvéta binocular rehe.""  This translates to: ""Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often far away and are best seen with binoculars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ohova’erã peteĩ safari jeguata reheguápe** (They will take a safari trip) - While a safari trip *includes* the possibility of seeing a cheetah, it doesn't specifically help you *see it better*.
* **B: Ohova’erã oguata peteĩ ka’aguýpe** (They will hide in a forest) - The text doesn't mention hiding.
* **D: Ejagarra peteĩ mba’yrumýi ha eiporu peteĩ equipo estándar** (They will rent a vehicle and use standard equipment) - Standard equipment is mentioned for general viewing, but binoculars are specifically highlighted for seeing cheetahs (and lions/leopards) well.

"Oñemopyendáva pe pehẽnguépe oje’éva rehe, mba'eichagua mymbápa oiméne ikatu ojuhu peteĩ visitante ojapo aja safari mba'yrumýime?","The correct answer is **A: León**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""León, guepardo ha leopardo-kuéra sapy'ánte hi'otĩ ha rehecha porãvéta binocular rehe.""  This translates to ""Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often seen and best viewed with binoculars."" This implies that seeing lions is a common and expected part of a safari experience, making them the most likely animal a visitor would hope to see on a safari.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Jirafa-kuéra:** While mentioned, they are simply listed as animals one might see, not highlighted as a key sighting.
* **C: Leopardo-kuéra:** Like lions and cheetahs, they *can* be seen, but aren't specifically presented as *the* animal people go to safaris to see.
* **D: Guepardo-kuéra:** Same reasoning as Leopardo-kuéra.

The passage states the purpose is to ""form groups with other people to share costs or to potentially have a better offer."" This directly translates to joining a group that *may* include one or more other people.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rehórõ neaño:** (You go alone) - The passage explicitly says the goal is to connect *with* others.
* **B: Rejuhúvo peteĩ aty irundy tapicha oĩha:** (You join a group of four people) - The passage doesn't specify a number, only that it could be one or more.
* **C: Rehórõ ambue ne rapicha ndive:** (You go with your friends) - While you *could* go with friends, the passage focuses on connecting with *other* people, potentially strangers, for cost-sharing/better deals.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...akói umi turista oku’e rupi omyanyhẽ hag̃ua peteĩ mba’yrumýi."" which translates to ""...like tourists who come looking for a bargain."" This directly answers the question of how someone might be able to get a good deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Peñembyatývo mbohapy tapicha:** (With three people) - The passage doesn't mention a specific number of people.
* **C: Reimérõ peteĩ ne angirũ ndive:** (Returning with a friend) - While the passage mentions not going alone, it doesn't say this *is* how you get a good deal.
* **D: Peñembyatývo po tapicha:** (With a few people) - Similar to B, it mentions going with others, but doesn't link it to getting a good deal.

(Its rich culture offers many things. Its activities include professional services, national heritage, culture, gastronomy and tourism.)  This directly links the city's appeal to its rich cultural offerings.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** While art and media are *part* of the culture, the passage doesn't highlight them as the main reason for attraction.
    * **B:**  Marketing efforts are not mentioned as the primary reason for attraction.
    * **D:**  The Asian influences are mentioned, but as a *part* of the city's appeal, not the core reason it's attractive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Py’ỹi ojehechaukájepi umi ta’ãngamýi ha aranduka** (The passage mentions arts and literature): While the passage *does* mention arts (music, cinema, literature), it doesn’t present this as something *unexpected* about San Francisco. It's presented as contributing to the city's cultural richness, not a surprising feature.
* **C: Oĩ heta hotel ha tenda ojejapoha amandaje** (There are many hotels and shops for accommodation):  The passage explicitly states San Francisco has a large tourism infrastructure with hotels.  This isn't something *unexpected*.
* **D: Pe virureko ojepytaso mbarete turismo rupive** (The lifestyle is greatly impacted by tourism): While true, the passage presents this as a general characteristic, not something surprising or unexpected.

The passage explicitly states: ""Viaje rehegua agencia rupive oñeikuave'ẽ jepi paquete oikehápe rambosarã, mba'yrumýi ojeho haguã aeropuerto gotyo térã paquete oikehápe jeveve ha hotel-kuéra."" (The travel agency offers, for example, a package that includes reimbursement for flights to the airport or a package including transport and hotels).  This implies a traveler *using* the services of a travel agent would benefit from these package options, especially regarding potential refunds or included services.  The passage also states potential complications *if* the arrangement is made directly with the hotel instead of through an agency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ viajero ipy’amokõiva** (A traveler who plans ahead) - The passage doesn't focus on planning, but on the *services* an agent provides.
* **B: Peteĩ viajero ojapóva sapy’a opa mba’e** (A traveler who does everything themselves) -  The entire point of the passage is that using an agent *helps* with things, making this option contradictory.
* **C: Peteĩ viajero ndoguerekóiva gueteri ivisa** (A traveler who doesn't have a visa) - While visas are mentioned as a document needed for travel, the passage doesn't say an agent specifically helps those *without* visas. They help ensure you *have* the correct documents.

Here's why:

The passage details how travel agents can offer packages that include transportation to/from the airport, hotels, and potentially even refunds.  It also mentions assistance with visas and other documents. This all points to the benefit of *complete packages* offered through a travel agent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuatia viaje rehegua pya’eve osẽ (Travel information just comes out):**  This is too vague. The passage details *specific* benefits beyond just receiving information.
* **B: Umi oferta hotel rehegua (Hotel offers):**  While hotels are mentioned, the passage highlights more than just hotel offers - it's the whole travel experience. You can book hotels yourself without an agent.
* **D: Omotenondévo peteĩ reserva (Making a reservation):**  You can make reservations yourself. The benefit isn’t simply *making* a reservation, but the *support and comprehensive services* that come with booking through an agent.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...hakatu oñeñangarekova’erã hese, ikatu rupi oĩgueteri jejavy.""  This translates to ""...but they often fail, and can be inaccurate.""  It then explains this inaccuracy stems from a difficulty understanding *context* – the things surrounding the words and the intent behind them.

This highlights the need for understanding *more than just the words themselves*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ombohasa umi signo pytagua ñe’ẽmegua (They struggle with basic grammatical signs in the language):** The passage doesn't focus on basic grammar, but on deeper meaning.
* **B: Ombohasapaite umi jehaipyre vore (They struggle with very complex translations):** While complexity is a factor, the primary issue described is understanding *context*, not just dealing with complicated sentences.
* **D: Ombohasa hekopete 100% pe aravoitépe (They struggle to be 100% accurate in real-time):**  While accuracy is an issue, the passage points to the *reason* for the inaccuracy – lack of contextual understanding.

Mbaʼépa opermiti ojejapo umi ñe’ẽasa conexión’ỹre?,"The correct answer is **C: Oñemboguejývo umi dato ñe’ẽnguéra rehegua** (Using the data of existing languages).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Google Translate (and applications like it) work by ""ñemboguejývo umi dato- kuéra ñe’ẽ ojeipotávagui"" - using data of languages that have already been input. This is how they can perform translation *without a connection* once the data is downloaded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umi tembiporu ñe’ẽasa rehegua oñemyatyrõva** (The programs related to language that are improving) - While language programs *are* improving, this doesn’t explain *how* offline translation works.
*   **B: Umi pumbyry iñarandúva rehegua** (The knowledgeable assistants) - This is irrelevant to the technical mechanism of offline translation.
*   **D: Umi aplicación oĩva umi categoría ñe’ẽasa ojejapova aravo teépe ryepýpe** (The applications that have language categories made quickly) - This describes the *existence* of such apps, not *how* they function offline.

Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’éi peteĩ desencadenante umi avalancha rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Yrypy’aku’i ojapáva** (Falling rain).

Here's why:

The passage states that ""nieve michĩmi nieve ho'va ikatu hína ombojoapykueripa ambue mba'e"" (wet snow can become a hazard).  Rain falling on snow adds weight and can destabilize the snowpack, *triggering* an avalanche.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yvypóra** (People) - While people can *cause* avalanches (e.g., skiing), the passage doesn't focus on human-caused triggers, but natural ones.
* **C: Kuarahy rendy** (Sunlight) - The passage mentions sunlight melting the snow, which contributes to instability, but isn't the *direct* trigger.
* **D: Yrypy’aku’i ho’a rasáva** (Warm rain) -  While warm rain is worse, the fact that it's rain falling on the snow, regardless of temperature, is the key element in causing avalanches described in the text.

Therefore, rain is the most directly mentioned factor as a potential trigger for avalanches in the given passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Umi pendiente yvate ikatu ojoko sapy'a umi volumen hembýva ha oguejýtava avalancha-ramo."" This directly translates to ""Steep slopes can accumulate large volumes and lead to avalanches."" This is the primary factor mentioned for avalanche formation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nieve oja'imi upéva rehe oikotevẽ activación** (Snow needs to be triggered to activate) - While triggering is *necessary* for an avalanche, it's not the *cause*.  The large volume of snow on a steep slope needs to *exist* first.
* **B: Umi pendiente yvate ndorekóiva nieve** (Steep slopes do not receive snow) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies; steep slopes *do* receive snow and that's the problem.
* **D: Nieve ndopokoiva’ekue hese yvypóra** (Snow doesn't care about people) - This is a distracting statement not related to the *cause* of avalanches.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, peteĩ curry oñemopyenda mba’e ingrediente rehe?","The correct answer is **B: Ka’avo ha especia-kuéra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Peteĩ curry hína peteĩ plato oikóva **ka'avo ha especia-kuéra** peteĩ so'o térã verdura-kuéra rehe."" This directly translates to ""A curry is a dish containing **spices and seeds** with a meat or vegetable.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yogur ha y:** While yogurt is *sometimes* used in curry (specifically in Northern India/Pakistan), it's not a defining ingredient of *all* curries.
*   **C: Kamby mbokajaguigua ha so’o:**  Kamby (meat) is mentioned as something curries can be *with*, but not a defining ingredient *of* the curry itself. Also, it specifically mentions *flavored* meat, and the passage doesn’t emphasize the flavoring as the defining characteristic.
*   **D: Verdura ha kamby:** Similar to C, vegetables and meat are *included* in curries, but they aren't the core ingredients that *make* a curry a curry.



"
"Oĩ tenda, sapyʼánte mbaʼe ingrediente curry-pegua rendaguépe ojeiporu kamby mbokajaguigua?","The correct answer is **D: Especia-kuéra** (Spices).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Peteĩ curry hína peteĩ plato oikóva **ka'avo ha especia-kuéra** peteĩ so'o térã verdura-kuéra rehe."" (Curry is a dish that has **meat and spices** with a meat or vegetable base).  It directly identifies spices as a key ingredient in curry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: So’o (Meat):** While curry *can* contain meat, it doesn't *always* and isn't a defining ingredient.
*   **B: Verdura-kuéra (Vegetables):**  Similar to meat, vegetables are a base, but not the defining ingredient.
*   **C: Yogur (Yogurt):** Yogurt is mentioned as being used in *some* curry recipes (North India), but it isn’t a general ingredient for all curries.

**Explicación:**

El texto indica que el sendero original (Polo Sur Travesía) se desvía a través de las Montañas Transatlánticas porque el sendero original, utilizado por los tractores que transportan combustible y suministros, no es estable (ndaipya'éi).  El desvío es necesario porque ese sendero no es seguro para seguir utilizándolo.

Las otras opciones son incorrectas:

*   **A:** La mención de la Estación McMurdo es solo para ubicar el inicio del sendero, no la razón del desvío.
*   **B:** Aunque el mar Ross pueda ser peligroso, el texto no indica que sea la razón para el desvío.
*   **D:** El texto no dice que no se pueda navegar por el mar Ross, sino que el problema está con el sendero terrestre."
"Pe Polo Sur Travesía pukukue, mba’épa ojehechauka poyvi rupive?","The correct answer is **C: Umi grieta henyhẽva yrypy’aku’ígui** (The crevasses formed by the ice).

Here's why:

The text states the route is marked by flags *because* of the snow and crevasses (""Upéva hína nieve oñepyrũpyréva ha ojehechauka bandera rupive."").  The crevasses are a significant hazard and the reason the route needs marking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pe tape oĩva Estación McMurdo-pe** (The road at McMurdo Station) - The passage describes a route *from* McMurdo Station, not the station itself.
*   **B: Umi tractor ogueraháva combustible** (The tractors carrying fuel) - Tractors are used *on* the route, but they aren't what marks it.
*   **D: Ipeligroso ojepiaha umi yvyty jerére** (The danger presented by the mountains) - The passage mentions mountains as a diversion *from* the original route, not as a primary hazard *on* the main route.

Mba’érepa noñeñe’ẽi pe pehẽnguépe peteĩ mba’e umi turista oikuaava’erãva oho jave África Sur-pe?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi tetã opaichagua oreko hetaichagua visa jejerure ome’ẽ hag̃ua** (Many countries have complex visa requirements to provide).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Visa jejerure repy ha oñeikotevẽva upevarã iñambue peteĩ tetãme ambue hendapeguágui ha he’iséta hína mba’e tetãguipa ojeju.""  This translates to: ""Visa requirements are complex and often require moving to another country and it states what each country demands."" This directly addresses the difficulty tourists face with visas when traveling to Southern Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojehórõ mba'yrumýime ojevisitakuaa umi tenda ndojehomemeiha** (It is a good idea to visit places that are not well known) - While the passage mentions exploring less-traveled tourist routes, it doesn't frame this as a reason for visa difficulties.
* **C: Haimete opaite tetãnguéra oĩva África sur-pe ykére oĩ porãmba** (All the countries in Southern Africa are good) - The passage doesn't make a general statement about the quality of all countries. It implies they have independent policies.
* **D: Oje’e iporãha ojeiporu peteĩ 4x4 ojeviaja-ramo mba’yrumýime** (It is recommended to use a 4x4 when traveling) - This is a logistical tip mentioned in the passage, but not a reason why tourists might find traveling to Southern Africa difficult.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa ojehecháta consejo vaírõ umi turista oikundahaséva pe g̃uarã África sur-pe mba’yrumýime?","The correct answer is **B: Jepémo oñerrecomenda peteĩ 4x4, ikatu avei ojeike peteĩ mba’yrumýi ndaha’éiva peichaguápe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...katu ojejerure tojeiporu peteĩ 4x4 de distancia entre ejes alta."" (It is recommended to use a 4x4 with a long wheelbase).  However, it also implies flexibility: ""...ikatu avei ojeike peteĩ mba’yrumýi ndaha’éiva peichaguápe"" (you can also use a vehicle that isn't that specific).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Léi ikatu ojerure umi tembiporu pytyvõ pya’erãoñeikotevẽva mba’yrumýime:** While the passage mentions needing to understand the benefits/requirements for a journey, it doesn’t state this is the *advice* given to tourists. It's something *you* need to do.
* **C: Mba’yrumýime jeviaja oikoite umi tapicha opiaséva ambue tapérupi:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ndaopavavéi tetãnguéra oĩva Sudáfrica sur-pe ykére ndaha’éi iporãitereiva ojevisita hag̃ua:** The passage actually implies the opposite – that Southern Africa is being developed for tourism, but neighboring countries are not as well-prepared.

Here's why:

* **The passage warns about the potential for being falsely accused.** It explicitly states someone could be framed with drugs (""rejejuhu rejeiporuha oñemohasa haguã droga reikuaa'ỹre"") and that others might make false accusations (""oikekuaa carcel-pe jeho 10 ary aja térã jejuka"").  The question asks about a potential danger related to being targeted while travelling. Being falsely accused fits this perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ikatu reikuaa’ỹre oñemboja nderehe reguerahaha droga:** While the passage mentions being framed with drugs, this isn’t the primary danger it's highlighting for *everyone* travelling. It's a *potential* outcome, not a general threat.
* **C: Ikatu oñeconfundi ambue tapicha mba’e ndive:** The passage doesn't mention confusion with other people.
* **D: Mburuvichakuéra ikatu ohecha umíva ha'eha peteĩ amenaza potencial bomba reheguáva:** The passage mentions bomb threats *made by others*, not that *you* are seen as a bomb threat.



**Translation of the relevant parts to help understand:**

* **P:** (The passage) warns about being falsely accused of drug trafficking and facing severe penalties in other countries (including long prison sentences). It also mentions potential false bomb threats.
* **Q:** ""What is the danger described in the passage where you could be targeted while traveling?""
* **A:** ""It is possible they could falsely accuse you.""

Mba’épa ndoje’éi pe pehẽnguépe droga jegueraha rehegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ambue tetãme, jepéramo peteĩ jeýnte oiko ko'ã delito; ko'ãvape ikatu ojejuka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Ambue tetã oguereko castigo draconiano-va, jepéramo peteĩ jeýnte oiko ko'ã delito; ko'ãvape oikekuaa carcel-pe jeho 10 ary aja térã jejuka.""  This translates to: ""Other countries have draconian punishments, even if someone commits these crimes; these can lead to imprisonment for up to 10 years or death.""

This directly answers the question of what isn't said about carrying drugs across borders - it isn't that it *won't* lead to severe consequences, but rather that other countries have extremely harsh punishments, *including* death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  The passage mentions potential consequences but doesn't focus on *why* people try to smuggle drugs into other countries.
* **C:** This refers to the possibility of evidence being used in investigations, not a consequence of the act itself.
* **D:** This talks about threats and bombs, which are related to drug trafficking, but not the primary consequence of *carrying* the drugs.

Here's why:

The passage (P) begins by mentioning ""Emyenyhẽ nde róga peteĩ café hévagui pyharevete..."" which translates to ""Bring me to your home a coffee for a lively afternoon...""  The question (Q) asks about something offered when someone visits, something prepared at home.  Coffee fits this description perfectly, as it's directly mentioned as being offered in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yvarykue (Fruit):** While fruit is nice, it's not the primary offering mentioned.
* **C: Guariryjúi (Mate):** Mate is a traditional drink, but not discussed in this passage.
* **D: Pohã rykue (Corn cake):**  Pohã rykue is a food, and while hospitable, isn't the primary focus of the initial offering described.

Here's why:

The passage (P) starts by mentioning coffee and chamomile tea being offered at your home (""Emyenyhẽ nde róga peteĩ café hévagui pyharevete ha peteĩ te relajante manzanilla-guigua pyharekue."").  The question (Q) asks about revisiting things from the passage during your vacation *and* your city's cultural exploration.  Offering coffee at your home is the most direct and relevant element from the passage that relates to both aspects of the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yva rykue térã batido oñevendeha** (Juice or smoothies are sold) - While smoothies are mentioned as something to *try*, it's not a core offering like the coffee at your home.
* **C: Umi pub nderehomemeiha** (Those pubs don't suit me) - The passage suggests *going to* pubs, not that they are disliked.
* **D: Umi restaurante ojapohápe té manzanilla-guigua** (Those restaurants make chamomile tea) - The passage specifically mentions chamomile tea being prepared *at your home*, not in restaurants.



"
Moõpa oĩ umi pykasu raʼãnga?,"The correct answer is **B: Cementerio-pe** (In the cemetery).

The text specifically states: ""Cementerio-pe, oĩ oñemomba’eguasúva mármol-guigua escultura, pykasu oĩva umi panteón ári."" which translates to ""In the cemetery, there are impressive marble sculptures, the statues are located near the pantheons.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Opyta media hora-hápe pe távagui** (It's a half hour away from the town) - The text doesn't mention distance.
*   **C: Ypa'ũ Eysturoy-pe** (On the island of Eysturoy) - While the town is *on* Eysturoy, the statues aren't specifically located *on* the island generally.
*   **D: Tupão ryepýpe** (On the large tower) - The tower is mentioned as a landmark, but the statues are not *on* it.

Here's why:

The passage specifically discusses a ""temimbo’e ñemoaranduverã visa"" (student/research visa) and details the requirements for it, *especially* related to proof of lodging (""viru oikove hag̃ua"") and a letter of acceptance from the educational institution (""carta oferta""). The question asks about a visa related to providing proof of lodging, which is the central topic of the student/research visa discussion in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñemba’aporã visa rehegua (Business visa):** The passage mentions business visas, but doesn't focus on their requirements.
* **B: Turista g̃uarã visa (Tourist visa):** While mentioned, the passage's detail is about student/research visas.
* **C: Visa jehosapy’arã rehegua (Transit visa):** This isn’t discussed in the passage at all.

Temimbo’e ñemoaranduverã visa py’ỹínte oguereko requisito ha procedimiento jejerure rehegua.""  This translates to: ""also students need to apply with tourists... I'm explaining the student visa requirements and procedures.""
* The text further details requirements *specifically* for students (""carta oferta"" - letter of acceptance from the educational institution, proof of lodging).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ turista jepiveguáva (A typical tourist):** The text mentions tourists needing visas, but focuses on the specific requirements for *students*.
* **B: Peteĩ viajero ikatupyrypámava (A traveler who can afford it):** The ability to pay doesn't dictate visa requirements.
* **D: Peteĩ oviajava negocio-rã (Someone traveling for business):** While business travelers *might* need visas, the passage focuses solely on students.

Mba’éicha javépa oñeñangarekomemeva’erã ñati’ũgui?,"The correct answer is **B: Ojeguata jave**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Arahakúpe jave, eñeñangarekova’erã ñati’ũgui esẽ esẽ ramo eguata selva tropical rehe.""  This translates to: ""When it's hot, we prefer to walk through the rainforest with shoes.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""How do we prefer to walk with shoes?""
* **""Ojeguata jave""** means ""we walk"", fitting directly with the passage's statement about *preferring* to walk with shoes when it's hot.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arahaku jave** - ""When it's hot"" - This describes *when* they walk, not *how*.
* **C: Ka’aguýpe** - ""In the forest"" - This describes *where* they walk, not *how*.
* **D: Oñemboguata aja** -  This doesn't fit the context of preferring to walk *with* shoes.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** talks about the importance of avoiding introducing invasive species into the rainforest and subtropical forests, specifically mentioning the dangers of introducing plants that spread quickly.  It emphasizes prevention.
* **Q (the question)** asks what *shouldn't* be done to avoid spreading invasive plants in the forest.
* **Option D** directly addresses this: ""Don't introduce invasive species when going into the forest."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's message of preventing the introduction of harmful plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ani reheja mba'yrumýi rokẽ ojeipe'a areterei** - ""Don't reject invasive species offered for free."" This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
* **B: Oñemboguata arahaku jave** - ""Go into the forest carefully."" While good advice, it doesn't specifically address preventing invasive species.
* **C: Oñemboguata umi tenda subtropical rupive** - ""Go into subtropical areas.""  This is irrelevant to the question about preventing invasive plants.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Upécharamo jepe, umi ka’aguy ndaha’éi manglares añónte, oĩ avei ipype rodal ipahápe opytáva ka’aguy guasúpe..."" (Even though these forests are not only mangroves, there are also large forests within it...). This directly answers the question of what else is found in the Sundarbans besides mangroves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ijyvy orekóvagui mbytere ojeaho’i karugua rendápe** (Its area is estimated to be about a third of the total) - This is a statement about the *area* of the Sundarbans, not something *within* it besides mangroves.
*   **C: Ha'e cinturón de manglares litorales tuichavéva arapýpe** (It is a dense coastal mangrove belt) - This *defines* what the Sundarbans are, but doesn't state something else it contains.
*   **D: Ko tendápe oĩ hetave ciervo para umi tigre Bengala-gui** (There are many deer in this area for the Bengal tigers) - This describes the *wildlife* found there, not a different type of forest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe mymba ka’aguy renda:** While the Sundarbans *is* a forest, the text identifies it by its specific name, not just as ""the large forest area"".
* **C: Pe Patrimonio de la Humanidad renda:**  It *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that's a designation, not the name of the forest itself.
* **D: Pe Ganges llanura:** The text states the forest is *within* the Ganges plain, it's not the name of the forest.

The passage states: ""hetave jey tapicha imitãvéva apytépe"" (many, even, people who immigrate among them).  It's talking about how many people *learn* English because they move to places where it's spoken.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tapichakuéra oñe’ẽva mokõi térã hetave ñe’ẽme** (People who speak two or more languages) - While the passage mentions multilingualism, it doesn't focus on *how* people learn English.
* **C: Yvyporakuéra ohóva Toronto-pe** (People who go to Toronto) - Toronto is used as an example, but the passage isn't about *only* people going to Toronto.
* **D: Tapichakuéra ijedavémava** (People who travel) - Travel isn't the primary reason for learning English as described in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hasy jepiva oje'e porã haguã ayvúpe."" which translates to ""...humor is used to make the advertisement more attractive.""  The humor *is* within the language used in the ad - the play on different accents and slang (""acento ha tenda argot"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñe’ẽ oguerekóva hetaichagua pu’atã** (Language with many words) - While the passage mentions a large vocabulary, it doesn't say this is *how* humor is created.
* **B: Tendakuéra réra** (Advertiser's names) -  The passage doesn’t discuss how advertisers' names create humor.

* To catch the 6:30 bus, a traveler would need to arrive at the station *before* 6:30.  6:20 is a reasonable time to arrive to ensure they don't miss it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text doesn't specify needing to go to Jakar. It mentions Jakar/Bumthang as destinations *from* the station.
* **B:** The text says buses leave *at* 7:30, not that you need to leave at 7.
* **C:** Paro is mentioned as a taxi destination, not a bus destination from the inter-district station.  And 11 aravo rire (after 11 o'clock) is not related to the bus schedule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: Hetaiterei autobús osẽjepi ára pukukue javeve** (There are many buses leaving every day) - While the passage says ""hetaiteve oĩ ohóva este gotyo Jakar / Bumthang-pe"" (many go to Jakar/Bumthang), it doesn't confirm *many* leave *every* day.  The important point is they fill up.
* **D: Peteĩ taxi oñondive ojeiporúva ikatu ha’e ñemongu’eha omachavéva** (A taxi available on demand can be a good guide) - The passage mentions taxis as a way to travel, but doesn’t suggest they act as guides.

This translates to ""This city differs from other cities in the country, especially due to its Arabian character within Africa.""  This directly indicates a strong Arabic influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: imboriahu** (it is famous) - While the passage mentions it's a known city, the question asks *what* makes it notable, and Arabic influence is the specific detail given.
* **C: Ndojeikekuaái aviõme** (It cannot be reached by plane) - The passage states it *has* an airport.
* **D: Ohecharamo gueteri umi turista omba’ekuaáseva** (It rarely receives tourists) -  The passage says it *has* a tourist attraction, suggesting it *does* get tourists.



"
Mavaitéva marandu Tombuctú reheguápa ha’e añetegua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndaha’éi imboriahuetereíva ha katu hekoambueterei** (It's not very well known but it exists).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko’ágã rupi g̃uarã, Tombuctú hína peteĩ táva oñemomboriahúva, jepéramo hembiasakue rupive oiko chugui peteĩ atracción turística ha oguereko peteĩ aeropuerto.""  This translates to: ""Thus, Tombuctú is a city that is not very well known, although it does exist as a tourist attraction and has an airport.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe távape ojeikekuaa aviõ rupive** (The city is accessed by plane) - While the passage *mentions* an airport, it doesn't say this is the *primary* way people know about it.
* **C: Sa'ive oguereko estilo africano umi táva ijerereguágui** (It definitely has an African style like other cities) - The passage mentions its resemblance to Arabian Africa, not just a general African style.
* **D: Pe táva ndogueruvéima turista-kuérape** (The city doesn't receive tourists) - The passage explicitly states it *is* a tourist attraction (""oiko chugui peteĩ atracción turística"").



"
Arakaʼépa oñeprograma ypy aʼekue umi Olimpiada arahakupegua? ,"The correct answer is **C: Jasyporundy ary 2021-pe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Paraolímpico ñeha'ã oikótva 24 jasyapy guive 5 jasyporundy peve 2021-pe."" which translates to ""The Paralympic Games took place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.""

Therefore, the Paralympic Games were programmed for September 2021."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e árape peteĩ embudo-gui oiko peteĩ tornado?","The correct answer is **B: Umi columna de aire oñepyrũvo ojere** (When columns of air begin to descend).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Oñepyrũ embudo oguejývaramo tormaneta araígui, ha oiko chugui tornado opokóvo yvy rehe.""  This translates to ""It begins as a funnel descending from a storm cloud, and a tornado exists when it touches the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yvytu ohupyty jave 100 milla rupi peteĩ aravópe** (When the wind reaches 100 miles per hour in one moment) - While high winds are *associated* with tornadoes, the passage says the tornado *forms* when the funnel descends, not just when high winds are present.
* **C: Oguejy aja umi arai yvytuguasuguiguáva** (When the stormy weather arrives) - Stormy weather is a prerequisite, but doesn't define the moment a tornado *exists*.
* **D: Opoko rire yvýre** (After touching the ground) - The passage specifically states the tornado *exists* when it touches the ground, not after.  The touching of the ground is the defining moment of its existence.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui peteĩ omombe’u hekopete mba’éichapa pe tornado?,"The correct answer is **D: Haʼe umi columna ojeréva ha omonguʼéva pe yvytu okápe** (It is a rotating column and lowers the air pressure).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Peteĩ tornado hína peteĩ columna ojeréva orekóva yvytu presión baja rehe..."" (A tornado is a rotating column with low air pressure...).  This is the defining characteristic of a tornado described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage *mentions* wind speeds of 100-200 mph, it doesn't define that as *what* a tornado *is*. It's a characteristic *of* a tornado.
* **B:** The passage says debris is *carried by* the tornado, but doesn't say the debris *is* the tornado.
* **C:** The funnel cloud (embudo) forming is a *stage* in tornado development, not the tornado itself. The tornado exists even if the visible funnel isn’t touching the ground.

"Péicha he'i pe pehẽnguépe, moõguipa peteĩ viajero omono’õva’erã consejo pe táva ohotaha política situación rehegua?","The correct answer is **B: Umi temiandu opresentáva pe marandu viaje reheguáva ryepýpe** (The information presented in the travel advisory).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes relying on information from travel advisories.** It specifically states the advisory includes a detailed political situation analysis of the destination country.  It stresses understanding this information to be aware, informed, and prepared.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pe tetã ohotaha gobierno guive** (The government of the country you are visiting) - While important, the passage doesn't suggest directly contacting the government. It focuses on *information* about the government and situation, delivered through the advisory.
* **C: Umi tetãygua oikóva pe tetã ojehotahápe** (The countries that are near the country you are visiting) -  This is irrelevant to the advice given in the passage.
* **D: Igobierno-guivoi** (Just the government) - Too vague and doesn't align with the specific advice of looking at a *comprehensive advisory*.



The passage is about using a *nemomarandu* (travel advisory) to understand the political situation of a destination. Therefore, the best advice for a traveler is to pay attention to the information *within* that advisory."
"Oĩramo peteĩ mba’e jesarekorã ojeviaja hag̃ua, mba'épa ndaha'éi katuete ikatúva ohasa peteĩ pytagua?","The correct answer is **B: Marandu mbyky hesakãporãva ha oñe'ẽva política situación tetãmegua rehe** (A comprehensive report detailing the political situation of the country).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the *ñemoamarandu* (research/trip) includes ""peteĩ marandu mbykymíme política situación upe tetãmeguáva"" (a detailed report on the political situation in that country).  The question asks what isn't necessarily part of a travel risk assessment.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seguro viaje jeheja rehegua ikatu ojepoko** (Travel insurance is possible) - The passage mentions this as a potential consideration.
* **C: Seguro tesãi rehegua ikatu ojepoko** (Health insurance is possible) - The passage mentions this as a potential consideration.
* **D: Marandu hesakãporãva oñe'ẽva situación política tetãmegua rehe** (A report detailing the political situation of the country) - While similar to B, ""hesakãporãva"" (detailed) is crucial - it's the *depth* of the political analysis that's described as being a key part of the research.  Option B includes the detail of being *comprehensive*.



Therefore, a *comprehensive* political report is a *core* component of the research described, making it the most accurate answer."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’eichagua viaje-pa sa’ive oikotevẽ pytyvõ reserva-rã peteĩ viaje agente-gui?","The correct answer is **B: Peteĩ viaje ipukúva mokõi arapokõindy peteĩ presupuesto particular-eterei reheve** (A trip that requires two quotes with a specific budget).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...heta agente ojeheka ambue viaje particular-vape, presupuesto retakué térã moõpa ojehóta.""  This translates to ""...many agents specialize in unique trips, with a limited or specific budget."" 

This means a good reason to use a travel agent is when you have specific budget constraints and need help finding options within those limits.  Getting multiple quotes (two in this case) helps ensure you're getting the best deal within your budget.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While a travel agent *could* help with a conference trip, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary reason.
* **C:**  The passage mentions culture and language, but doesn't suggest needing an agent *specifically* for a language-focused trip.
* **D:**  Traveling to a foreign country for the first time is a general reason to consider an agent, but the passage emphasizes more specialized needs like budget and unique trips.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’e kásopepa oñebeneficiavéta peteĩ viajero oipytyvõramo chupe peteĩ viaje agente?","The correct answer is **A: Pe viajero orreserva jave vuelo jeho ha jejukuévo g̃uarã ovisita hag̃ua itavaguasu** (The traveler reserves flights and accommodation to visit a big city).

Here's why:

The passage states that a travel agent provides options for trips including transport, lodging, culture, language and visits to foreign countries.  Reserving flights and accommodation (vuelo ha jejukuévo) to visit a city (itavaguasu) is a direct benefit a travel agent can provide, fitting the description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Pe viajero orreservase ñepyrũ jave peteĩ excursión especial** (The traveler first reserves a special excursion) - While a travel agent *could* arrange this, it's a specific activity, not a core benefit like arranging the fundamental travel logistics.
* **C: Pe viajero oñe’ẽporãrõ ñe’ẽ ojeiporúva ohotahápe** (The traveler speaks well the language used when arriving) - This is a skill of the traveler, not a service provided *by* the agent.
* **D: Pe viajero ovisita jave peteĩ tenda oikuaahápe oĩha hetaichagua cultura ha’e oikuaáva** (The traveler visits a shop where there are many cultures he knows) - This is an activity that might *result* from travel, but isn't a direct benefit of using a travel agent.

"Pe pehẽnguépe heʼiháicha, mbaʼépa ikatu oipytyvõ peteĩ oviajavape ani hag̃ua ipochy ovisita jave umi tenda pyahu?","The correct answer is **A: Oha’ãrõva’erã umi mba’e tojogua umi mba’e oĩva ha’e ouhágui** (Preparing to adapt to the things that are there and how they are done).

Here's why:

* **P's text emphasizes preparation for a trip by researching everything about the destination.**  It lists numerous things to learn *before* going: customs, people, food, traffic, lodging, safety, language, etc.  The main point is to avoid being caught off guard (""ogapeguáicha"" - surprised/unprepared).
* **Q asks how to avoid being surprised when visiting places.**  
* **Option A directly addresses this by suggesting preparation and adaptation.**  Learning how things are done *before* you go is the key to avoiding surprises.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pe voluntad oñeha’ã hag̃ua ho’u umi tembi’u ndoikuaáiva** (The willingness to try unfamiliar foods) - While being open to new foods is *part* of traveling, it's a small part of the overall preparation needed.  It doesn't address the breadth of things mentioned in P.
* **C: Ojepytasóvo umi léi ojoajúva moõguipa ou rehe** (Only following the laws that apply to them) -  Following laws is important, but it's just one aspect of being prepared.
* **D: Ani oporandueterei pe alojamiento rehe oho mboyve** (Not worrying about lodging before going) - This is the *opposite* of what P suggests. P specifically lists lodging as something to research beforehand.



Therefore, **A** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Oñemopyendáva umi marandu oĩva pe pehẽnguépe rehe, mbaʼeichagua tapichápa ikatu ipochy oho jave ambue tendápe?","The correct answer is **A: Peteĩ tapicha oguerohorýva umi tembi’u iñambuetereíva** (A person who researches the available food).

Here's why:

* **P's text** lists many things to research before a trip (""food, traffic, lodging, transportation, language, etc."") to make the trip successful.  The core idea is *preparation* based on research.
* **Q's question** asks how someone can best prepare to go to another country.
* **Option A** directly addresses one of the key elements mentioned in P – *food* – and implies research (""oguerohorýva"" means researching or finding out about).  Someone who researches the food options is actively preparing for the trip.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: Peteĩ tapicha oñemotenondéva iñambue rupive** (A person who adapts with flexibility) - While adaptability is *helpful* on a trip, it's not the primary way to *prepare* beforehand.
* **C: Peteĩ tapicha iñapytu’ũ ñembotýva** (A person with a strong will) -  Willpower doesn't help you find a place to stay or understand the language.
* **D: Peteĩ tapicha ovy’áva oñemoarandu jave** (A person who is busy studying) -  This is too general and doesn't specifically relate to travel preparation.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer because it directly reflects the importance of researching a key aspect of travel (food) as highlighted in the original passage."
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’éi consejo porã umi viajero-pe g̃uarã ovisita ñepyrũva peteĩ tetã okakuaáva ohóvo?,"The correct answer is **C: Oje’e iporãha peteĩ tupa’i térã kyha oñeacampa-ramo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns about scorpions and snakes.** It advises bringing a hat or netting (""tupa'i térã kyha"") to protect yourself. This directly addresses a potential danger for first-time visitors to a country with different wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eikuaaraẽ mymba upe tendapegua rehegua reke mboyve yvýpe:**  The passage *describes* sleeping on the ground, it doesn't recommend being prepared for it. It suggests this is something to *avoid* if possible.
* **B: Ani rehundiparei nde viru tembi’úre umi ára iñepyrũmbýpe:** This is about not being picky with food in the initial days, and while relevant to adjusting, it isn’t the most *important* advice for safety.
* **D: Epaga peteĩ hotel iporãva rehe pe reguahẽ ypy guive:** The passage actually suggests hotels as a way to *ease* into the cultural adjustment, not as the primary focus. It’s more about a gradual transition.



Therefore, option C is the most direct and practical advice given in the passage for first-time visitors to a less developed country."
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndoje’éi ha’eha peteĩ mba’e ojedespilfarrava’erãha ojejepokuaaramóme peteĩ tetã ojeguerojerávape?,"The correct answer is **A: Tembi’u occidente estilo**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the initial shock of arriving in a new country and the desire for familiar comforts to ease the cultural adjustment. It specifically mentions wanting to find a hotel with Western-style food and drinks to help with the transition.  This highlights the *avoidance* of something that could be considered a wasteful expense when trying to acclimate to a new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Servicios iporãvéva rehe (About good services):** While good services are nice, the passage focuses on *specific* comforts (food, drinks) rather than general services.
*   **C: Peteĩ colchón térã aramboha’i ojejapo hag̃ua camping (A mattress or hammock for camping):** The passage mentions these as things you might *not* find readily available, and suggests needing to bring your own protection against insects, not as something wasteful.
*   **D: Hotel iporãvéva rehegua (About a good hotel):** The passage uses a good hotel as an *example* of a comfort, but the focus is on the *type* of comfort (Western food) rather than simply a nice hotel.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Rehóramo peteĩ computadora popegua térã tableta rehe, eñongatu peteĩ copia memoria térã disco-pe (ijeikekuaahápe internet-ỹre).""  This directly addresses the scenario of not having internet access and suggests saving a copy on a flash drive/disk.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: Ome’ẽvo peteĩ copia peteĩ iñirũ de viaje-pe** (Give a copy to a travel companion) - While helpful, this doesn't address *your* access to the policy if separated from the companion.
* **B: Omondo correo electrónico rupive ijupe peteĩ copia** (Send a copy to yourself via email) - The passage acknowledges email is good, but also points out the need for a backup *without* needing internet access.
* **D: Oñongatúvo peteĩ copia “arai”-pe** (Keep a copy ""online"") -  This directly contradicts the question's premise (""katu ikatu ndorekói acceso internet-pe"" - even if you don't have internet access).



Therefore, option C is the most direct and practical solution presented in the text for having a policy copy accessible *without* internet."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pe aseguradora correo electrónico** - While the email is mentioned, it's *along with* the international paperwork, not the sole requirement.
*   **C: Umi pumbyry papapy internacional umi ñemoñeĩrã** - The text doesn't specify that the paperwork is *for claims* specifically, but for assistance/claims generally.
*   **D: Pe póliza jára correo electrónico** - The text mentions having a copy of the policy readily available (email or saved), but it's the international paperwork needed *in addition* to that for help.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mbaʼe tamaño negativopa ohechauka pe ta'ãngamýi formato ojepuruvéva?","The correct answer is **B: 56 x 56 mm negativo rehegua**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the alternative camera format uses a 6 x 6 cm format, which translates to a negative of **56 x 56 mm**. The other options refer to the standard 35mm format."
Mávapa umi ta’ãngamýi formato rehegua apytégui oikuave’ẽ resolución ojoguáva peteĩ DSLR-pe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ta’ãngamýi 6 x 6 cm rehegua**.

Here's why:

The text states that the 6 x 6 cm format (with a 56 x 56 mm negative) offers four times the resolution of a 35mm negative. It also implies this higher resolution is comparable to what modern DSLRs can achieve. Therefore, the 6 x 6 cm format is the one that most closely relates to the resolution capabilities of a DSLR, as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ta’ãngamýi 35 mm rehegua:** The passage specifically says the 6x6 format has *more* resolution than 35mm.
*   **B: Ta’ãngamýi formato mediano rehegua:** While 6x6 *is* a medium format, the question asks specifically which relates to DSLR resolution, and the text focuses on the 6x6 dimensions.
*   **C: Ta’ãngamýi 56 x 56 mm rehegua:** This is the negative size *within* the 6x6 format, not the format itself. While correct in terms of size, it doesn't answer the question about overall resolution comparison to DSLRs.

Here's why:

* **P (the prompt)** is asking about *how* to start a travel business website. It mentions the person likes blog posts and wants to learn about web design and development to create a good website.
* **Q (the question)** asks what's important for starting a travel business.
* **Option A** directly addresses the need to focus on the *format* of the website - the design, structure, and how it functions, which is the core of the prompt's request.  This is the most logical first step.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ehai heta artículo peteĩ blog de viajes herakuã porãvape g̃uarã** (Read many articles from a good travel blog) - While helpful for *content* ideas, it doesn't address the foundational need of building the website itself.
* **C: Emopu’ã nde página web tee** (Create your webpage) -  You can't just *create* a webpage without knowing the format and structure.
* **D: Eñembokatupyryve edición-pe** (Focus on editing) - Editing is important *after* you have content and a basic website structure.



Therefore, understanding the **web format** is the essential first step in starting a travel business website, making **A** the most correct answer."
"Oñemoñepyrũvo peteĩ viaje jehaipy negocio-pe jeike reheguáva, mávapa umi mba'e eñemoaranduvéva'erã?","The correct answer is **A: Blogs web renda**.

Here's why:

The question (Q) asks what someone should research when starting a business trip. The passage (P) states that researching ""blogs web renda"" (income-generating web blogs) is helpful for understanding how to start an income-generating website.  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Formato web (web format)** - While important, the passage doesn't specifically mention researching *format* as a first step.
* **C: Web ñemoambuépe (web development)** -  Development comes *after* understanding the income potential (blogs web renda).
* **D: Moñepyrũ web renda (starting an income-generating website)** - This is the *goal*, not the initial research step. You research *before* you start.

Mba'éichagua clima-pepa ojejuhújepi umi mba’asy tye rehegua?,"The correct answer is **D: Umi clima seco-pe** (In dry climates).

Here's why:

The passage describes germs, bacteria, and ""flegelo Delhi ryepýgui, faraón maldición, Moctezuma ha iñangirũnguéra venganza"" (which sounds like descriptions of various diseases and plagues).  These thrive in dry conditions. The passage mentions bacteria living *inside* the head, suggesting a dryness that allows them to flourish.  Dry climates are conducive to the spread of airborne illnesses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umi clima ro’ysãme** (In humid climates): Humidity generally *inhibits* the spread of many germs and bacteria.
* **B: Umi clima polar-pe** (In polar climates):  Extremely cold temperatures can kill some germs, and polar climates aren't typically known for widespread disease outbreaks described in the passage.
* **C: Umi clima hakúvape** (In hot climates): While some diseases are prevalent in hot climates, the passage doesn’t specifically point to heat as a key factor for these particular germs. Dry heat is more relevant.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ógape, ñaime rupi expuesto ko'ã germen-kuéra upepeguápe, ikatuete nde repytáma inmune umi mba'épe.""  This translates to: ""Perhaps, if you are regularly exposed to these germs in that place, you can become immune to what.""  The question asks what regular exposure can lead to immunity *against*. The passage directly links exposure to ""ko'ã germen-kuéra upepeguápe"" (these germs in that place) with potential immunity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apañuái tyekue rehegua** (Respiratory infections) - While the passage *mentions* respiratory infections, it doesn't say exposure leads to immunity against them.
* **C: Apañuái pyturape rehegua** (Skin infections) - The passage doesn't focus on skin infections.
* **D: Delhi rye rehegua** (Delhi rye) -  Delhi rye is mentioned as a result of the germs, not something you become immune to *from* the germs.

This translates to ""During the rainy season (from September to January), they are bigger and the falls are fuller.""  Therefore, the best time to visit Victoria Falls is during those months because the falls are at their most impressive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikatúta ehecha hekoitépe mba'éichapa añetete umi catarata:** (You can see how the falls are formed) - While interesting, the passage doesn't specifically say *why* it's good to go then.
* **B: Sa’ive turista-kuéra:** (There are many tourists) - The passage mentions tourists, but not as a *reason* to go during that time.
* **D: Ani eho ára oky hetaveha jave:** (It doesn't have a rainy season) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mávapa koʼãva apytégui noñerrecomendái ojeiporu jave peteĩ dron oñefilma hag̃ua?","The correct answer is **C: Oinvestigávo umi permiso** (Investigate the permits).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dron ñemboveve peteĩ aeropuerto ykérehe térã yvypóra aty ári na’ipórãi ojejapo, ni ndaha’éiramo ilegal eimehápe."" (Flying a drone near an airport or a group of people is not advisable, nor is it legal in some cases.)  This directly implies the need to check what is *permitted* before flying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojejesarekova’erã ojeho mboyve mba'épa ojeheja oñefilma** (It is recommended to first check what is being filmed) - While good practice, it doesn’t address the *legality* of flying the drone.
* **B: Ojehupyty hag̃ua licencia adicional** (To require an additional license) - The passage doesn't mention needing an additional license, only the potential for illegality.
* **D: Oñefilmávo umi área henyhẽvape añoite ndojehechakuaamo'ãihápe upe dron** (Filming in areas that are not visible at night where the drone is not seen) - This focuses on visibility, not the legal requirements of flying.



Therefore, the passage stresses the importance of understanding and obtaining the necessary **permits** before operating a drone."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, moõpa oĩ umi tendaiporãvéva oñefilma hag̃ua ojeiporúvo peteĩ dron?","The correct answer is **D: Umi tenda oñeme’ẽmahaguépe ndéve permiso** (The rules that give you permission).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dron ñemboveve peteĩ aeropuerto ykérehe térã yvypóra aty ári na’ipórãi ojejapo, ni ndaha’éiramo ilegal eimehápe."" This translates to ""Flying a drone near an airport or a group of people is not advisable, or it may even be illegal.""  This directly implies you need *permission* or to follow *rules* to legally operate a drone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ava’aty ypýpe reikuaarõ ndaipochymo’ãiha hikuái reiporuhaguére ijykére dron:** This translates to ""The forest is a good place to fly a drone."" While a forest *might* be a good location, it doesn't address the *rules* for flying.
* **B: Umi tenda ndojehejaihápe oñeguenohẽ fotografía:** This translates to ""The rules don't allow for taking photographs."" This is unrelated to drone regulations.
* **C: Umi tenda oñeme hetahápe sa'ive ojehechatahápe dron:** This translates to ""The rules are many when you see a drone."" This is a vague description and doesn't pinpoint the importance of permission.



Therefore, option D directly reflects the main point the passage makes about needing to follow regulations when operating a drone."
"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba'e ñe’ẽasãi oñe'ẽva pe requisito de registro proceso de visa rehe ndaha'éi añeteguáva?","The correct answer is **D: Oĩ tenda umi hotel-pe ikatuha omaneja pe ñemboheraguapy**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in some countries, hotels are required to keep a register (often a police form) of guests. This means hotels *manage* the registration process for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oiméramo repyta umi alojamiento turístico-pe, ikatu natekotevẽi reñemboheraguapy:** This translates to ""Even if it is required of tourist accommodations, you may not need to register."" This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **B: Mayma tetã ojerure oñeñemboheraguapy hag̃ua moakãharakuéra upepegua ndive:** This translates to ""Every country requires registration of visitors."" The passage says this isn't true – it varies by country.
* **C: Ikatu tekotevẽ ojevisita umi oficina de inmigración:** This translates to ""You may have to visit the immigration offices."" While possible in *some* cases, the passage specifically mentions hotels handling registration in many countries.



"
Mávapa ko’ãva apytégui ndaha’éi peteĩ tenda ikatuha oho peteĩ turista oñeñatende hag̃ua chupe iregistro rehe?,"The correct answer is **B: Pe tenda ojepytahápe** (At the place of lodging).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ambue tetãme, ejapo va'erã registro reimeha ha tenda repytaha moakãharakuéra upepegua ndive.""  This translates to ""...in other countries, they make the registration with the lodging where the tourists are staying.""

Therefore, a tourist would need to register *at the place they are staying* (the hotel, Airbnb, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ tahachirenda upe tendapegua** (A representative of the lodging) - While lodging staff *facilitate* registration, the tourist doesn't go to a representative specifically.
* **C: Peteĩ oficina de correos local-pe** (At a local post office) - The passage doesn't mention post offices.
* **D: Umi inmigración oficina-kuéra rehehápe** (At the immigration offices) - The passage states this *might* be necessary in some cases (""oikotevẽ oñemyanyhẽ peteĩ formulario policía upepegua ndive térã peteĩ visita inmigración oficina-kuérape""), but the primary location is the lodging itself.

Mávapepa noipytyvõmo’ãi ombaʼapórõ voluntario-ramo oviaja aja?,"The correct answer is **C: Oĩ oha’ãrõva ohupyty peteĩ katupyry pyahu** (There is help to receive a spiritual gift).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...avei eguereko katupyry pyahu"" (and also possesses a spiritual gift).  It then continues to say a volunteer can receive what they need through the work of other volunteers. This directly relates to receiving a spiritual gift as a benefit of volunteering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oĩ oha’ãrõva ojuhu angirũ pyahu tetã ambuére** (There is help to travel to another country) - While the passage mentions traveling, it doesn't specifically say help *with* travel is offered.
* **B: Oĩ ohekáva peteĩ jehepyme’ẽ porã** (There is a good reward) - The passage mentions help and support, but doesn't focus on a specific ""reward.""
* **D: Peteĩ tapicha ikatúva ointeresa chupe oiko hag̃ua ha hi'upyrã.** (A person who might be interested in living with and helping him/her) - This refers to finding someone to help, not a benefit *of* volunteering itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ume voluntario rembiapo rehe ikatu oñeme’ẽ ndéve reiko hag̃uã ha ojehepyme’ẽ ndéve michĩmi.""  This directly translates to ""...the work of other volunteers can allow you to go and also help you with expenses."" This aligns perfectly with option C, which states ""Sapy’ánte ikatu oñeme’ẽ ndéve reiko hag̃ua ha hi'upyrã"" (Others can allow you to go and help).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haimete akóinte ojehepyme’ẽ:** (Sometimes it helps) - Too vague and doesn't capture the specific benefit of volunteer work mentioned in the text.
* **B: Uperire ikatu osẽ ambue mba’apo:** (You can leave for other jobs) - This is the opposite of what the text describes; volunteering *enables* travel, not leaving for other work.
* **D: Ikatu nepytyvõ ema’ẽ hag̃ua ambueháicha:** (You can help to go another way) - This refers to helping *others*, not receiving help yourself, which is the focus of the question and the passage.

"He’iháicha pe pehẽnguépe, mba’épa ikatu he'i jepivegua'ỹvaha pe viajero promedio Walt Disney World-pe?","The correct answer is **C: Ojehasávo viaje pukukue Disney-pe** (Planning a trip to Disney).

Here's why:

The passage states that a typical ""pilgrimage"" to Walt Disney World involves planning – from flights to hotels to transportation within Disney property.  The phrase ""Disney World-pejeho rehe"" (going to Disney World) refers to *the entire planning process* involved in the trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojehasávo peteĩ arapokõindy pukukue oñeikundaha umi parque** (Planning a schedule to visit the parks) - This is *part* of the planning, but not the overall idea.
* **B: Ojepytávo peteĩ hotel oĩ mombyrývape** (Booking a nearby hotel) - Again, a *step* in the planning, not the whole thing.
* **D: Ojejagarra peteĩ autobús aeropuerto guive hotel peve** (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel) -  This is just one detail of the trip, not what defines going to Disney World.

Mávapa ko’ã mba’e oje’éva Walt Disney World rehegua apytégui ndaha’éi añetegua?,"The correct answer is **A: Umi jeikerã Park-hopper ikatu oñembohasa ambue viajero-kuérape** (The Park-hopper tickets can be transferred to other travelers).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Disney *prohibits* reselling tickets to individuals. This directly addresses the issue of tickets being sold on websites like eBay and Craigslist.  The fact that people *are* selling them doesn't make it allowed, and Disney actively prevents it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Oĩ alojamiento upe tendapete ojeguerekóva** (There is lodging in the tent provided) - The text mentions hotels, not tents.
* **C: Oĩ autobús ojeguerekóva oñembohasa hag̃ua umi viajero-pe aeropuerto guive pe propiedad peve** (There is a bus to transport travelers from the airport to the property) - This is *described* as happening, but it's a standard service, not something that's being questioned as potentially not legitimate.
* **D: Umi jeikerã heta árape g̃uarãva ikatu ojejuhújepi umi web renda subasta aporã** (Tickets for many days can be found on popular online auction websites) - The text states this *happens*, but then immediately points out Disney *doesn’t allow* it.  The question asks what is *not* legitimate.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Peteĩ internet-pe jeheka """"Ñorairõ renda mbo'epy rehegua"""" ikatu ome'ẽ peteĩ empresa upepegua renda."" (On the internet, a search for """"War scenario training"""" could provide a company with income.)  And it describes a training involving role-playing, first aid, and detailed briefings *specifically* related to a war scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Supervivencia desiertope rehegua.** (Desert survival) - While desert survival materials are *mentioned* as being available, the training focuses on war scenarios, not specifically desert survival.  They're just an example of available resources.
* **B: Primero auxilio ñembosako’i** (First aid training) - First aid is *part* of the training, but it's not the *focus* of the entire program.
* **D: Juegos de roles rehegua** (Role-playing) - Role-playing is a *method* used in the training, not the subject of the training itself.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: """"Ñorairõ renda mbo'epy rehegua"""" ikatu ome'ẽ peteĩ empresa upepegua renda. (A ""War game training"" on the internet could provide income for a company.)  The entire description revolves around a training exercise simulating a war scenario (""ñorairõ renda"").  The other options are *elements* within that training (first aid, desert survival), but the overarching theme and what the training focuses on is war game/scenario training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Primero auxilio rehegua (First aid):** First aid is *part* of the training, but not the main focus.
*   **C: Supervivencia desiertope rehe (Desert survival):**  Desert survival resources are mentioned as examples, but the training isn’t *specifically* about desert survival.
*   **D: Umi ñorãirõ renda rehegua (Those about war games):** This is too vague. The question asks what the *mbo'epy* (training) is *about*.  ""Ñorãirõrã renda rehegua"" directly answers that.

Here's why:

The passage states that some methods require boiling water for a long time (""ambuévape oikotevẽ hetave""). This is presented as a safer option than relying on filters with varying effectiveness (""Filtro-kuéra oreko jepi variación efectividad-pe"").  The passage implies that boiling for a sufficient duration is a reliable way to address potential contamination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojejogua y botellapegua** (Judging bottled water) - The passage mentions bottled water as an *example* of something to be cautious of, not as a solution.
* **C: Oñembopupu y peteĩ aravo’i aja** (Boil the water for just a moment) -  The passage contrasts this with methods requiring longer boiling times, implying it's not sufficient.
* **D: Oñehesa’ỹijo pe y jahecha oĩpa amenaza específica** (Test the water and check for a specific threat) - While testing is good, the passage focuses on immediate actions someone can take *without* knowing the specific contaminant.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...flujo oguevíva ola-kuéra ojokáva y rembe'ýre py'ỹinte peteĩ arrcife térã ojoguahápe."" (The current carries people and pushes them towards a reef or a rock.)  And later, ""...ikatu'ỹva ojejapo. Ágã resẽvove upe ysyrýgui, jeyta jey ndahasyvéima jepivéramogui."" (It could happen. Even if you leave the current, you might not be able to get back.)  This implies the danger lies in being pushed *onto* the reef.  The question asks what prevents people from returning *even if they leave the current*. The reef is the obstacle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojeyta y hypývape** - Being in the depth isn't the preventing factor.
* **C: Ojeyta ysyry rovái** - The current itself isn't stopping them, the obstacle *within* the current is.
* **D: Ojeyta umi ola jerére** - The waves are mentioned as part of the current, but the reef is the specific hazard.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eñeha'ã ejapi peteĩ tenda ndejapy'ỹ jeýta gotyo térã nde katupyrykue ome'ẽramo nderecháramo, ikatu reha'ãrõ peteĩ rescate.""  This translates to: ""Try to have a tent with you to shelter or if your companion gives you or lends you something, you can attempt a rescue.""

The question asks what you should do to save yourself from a river current.  The passage *directly* suggests taking a tent for shelter as a proactive measure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eyta pya’eve pe ysyry rovái** (It's small, the river flows) - This doesn't offer a solution for getting *out* of a dangerous current.
* **C: Eyta ambue gotyo** (It's something else) -  Too vague and doesn't address the situation.
* **D: Eyta pe guýpe** (It's on the ground) - Irrelevant to escaping a river current.

Here's why:

* **The question asks where you can visit castles as part of a worthwhile excursion.** The passage specifically mentions ""castillo-kuéra Valle del Loira-peguápe jeikuaa, avei valle del Rin..."" (castles in the Loire Valley, also the Rhine Valley...).  This directly links castles with the Rhine Valley as a place for excursions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Peteĩ táva oĩva Danubio rembeʼýpe (A town on the Danube River):** While the passage mentions Danube cruises, it doesn't specify towns *along* the river being the focus of castle visits.
* **B: Canal Erie ykére (On the Erie Canal):** The passage mentions the Erie Canal, but focuses on *traveling by boat* on it, not castle visits.
* **D: Tenda hi’ag̃uĩva oimeraẽ ygaratápe ñeikundaha (A place that suggests traveling by boat):** This is too general. The passage discusses various forms of travel, but the Rhine Valley is the specific location related to castles.

This translates to ""The women are very aware of the different ways of living that could bring many undesirable things for them, a harassment and abuse that could lead to being manipulated or harmed in various ways.""  This directly implies they are knowledgeable about the dangers and difficulties (jejoavy teko) faced by women in that region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ejejoko ani hag̃ua reñe’ẽ estado civil rehe:** (I refuse to talk about marital status) - The passage doesn't mention anything about refusing to discuss marital status.
* **C: Ani reiporu mba’evera ojehecharamóva:** (Don't report anything that is observed) -  The passage implies *awareness* of danger, not a directive to remain silent.
* **D: Eñemombarete tekotevẽ jave:** (They should be prepared) - While preparedness might be a consequence of their awareness, the passage focuses on their *knowledge* of the risks, not specifically on preparation.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns against responding to unwanted advances or harassment.** It states ""Aníke ndepytaryrýi embotove hag̃ua kuimba’épe"" (Don't respond to him to avoid getting involved) and cautions against even acknowledging unwanted attention (""ani ekyhyje emoañete hag̃ua neremimo’ã"").  Option D directly reflects this warning about inappropriate insinuations and the importance of not engaging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojehechakuaa ndaha’eiha jepivegua jehapykueho.** (It's understood that self-defense isn't the first recourse.) While self-defense might be a *last* resort, the passage focuses on *avoiding* escalation and not responding in the first place.
* **B: Emoĩ peteĩ kuãirũ tuicháva rehechauka hag̃ua remendavaha.** (Report a large bird to change your fate.) This is nonsensical and doesn't relate to the advice given in the passage.  The ""kuãirũ"" (bird) is a metaphor for someone offering unsolicited help, and the passage warns against relying on them.
* **C: Entendeva’erã umi teko iñambueha ohechaukaha ndoipotaiha reñemantene nde rekópe.** (Understand the new behaviors you see don't allow them to stay in your life.) This is a general statement about recognizing and ending unhealthy relationships, but doesn't directly address the *immediate* advice of how to handle unwanted attention as presented in the passage.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate reflection of the passage's guidance on how to handle potential harassment or unwanted advances."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umi ta'ãnga ojeiporúramo oñeikuaave’ẽ hag̃ua** (Images that are only used to be advertised) - The passage doesn't focus on the *purpose* of the photos, just the need for specific equipment.
* **C: Umi mymba oñeguenohẽva ta’ãngápe otĩramo** (Animals that are captured in specific poses) - The passage doesn't mention pose, it's about *distance*.
* **D: Peteĩ parque oguerekórõ mbojojaha oñeguenohẽ haguã ta'ãnga ojehepyme'ẽ haguã.** (A park with restrictions to capture marketable images) - While the passage mentions parks with restrictions, it's not the *reason* a telephoto lens is needed.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the challenge of photographing exotic animals.** It explicitly states ""Heta mymba exótico hasy ojejuhu haguã"" (Many exotic animals are sought after to be photographed).  The entire description revolves around the difficulties of finding and capturing images of these animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ojetrata vove mymbakuéra pochy ndive** (Negotiating with poachers) - While the passage implies risk, it doesn't mention *negotiating* with poachers.
* **C: Ojehupyty hag̃ua umi lente oñeikotevẽva** (Planning which lenses to use) -  Lenses are mentioned, but the passage focuses on *finding* the animals, not *choosing* the equipment.
* **D: Omba’apóvo umi tekoha potemcialmente hostil-pe** (Dealing with potentially hostile environments) -  Hostile environments are mentioned as a possibility, but they are a *part* of the overall challenge of photographing exotic animals, not the central difficulty.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tapekuéra helada ha nevada oĩhápe, **fricción sa'ive** ha ndaikatúi oñemboguata reimeramoguáicha peteĩ asfaltado perõme.""  This translates to: ""On icy and snowy roads, **friction is high** and it's not like driving on asphalt.""

This high friction makes driving difficult and dangerous, especially for a driver navigating mountain roads.  The other options are mentioned in the passage, but aren't the *direct* reason for the difficulty described in the context of mountain driving.

*   **A: Tráfico mbarete** (Heavy traffic) - Mentioned, but not the primary issue.
*   **C: Condensación hetaiterei** (High condensation) - A factor in ice formation, but not the immediate problem for a driver.
*   **D: Jehecha sa’ive** (High visibility) - The passage actually mentions that visibility can be *poor* due to snow and ice.

Mba'épa oiméne opyta peteĩcha renta rehegua impuesto opáichagua tetã rupi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñemohendapy** (Standardization).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Renta rehegua impuesto oñemohenda ha oñemoambue tetãnguérape..."" which translates to ""Income tax is *standardized* and modified for each country...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hepykue (Complexity):** While income tax *can* be complex, the passage focuses on how it's *adapted* to each country, not its inherent complexity.
* **C: Moõpa oñemog̃uahẽ (How it is presented):**  The passage doesn't discuss how taxes are *presented*, but rather how they are *structured*.
* **D: Mopyendaha (Classification):** The passage isn't about classifying income tax, but about its adjustment across nations.

Therefore, **Ñemohendapy (Standardization)** is the best answer as it directly reflects the information provided in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomatic immunity *includes* being exempt from income tax in the host country.  Therefore, if you are working in another country as a diplomat and your salary is paid by another source, you will be exempt from income tax in that country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Estados Unidos-pe:**  While the US has federal and local taxes, this isn't a general rule for diplomats.
* **C: Tetã remba'apohápe ko'ágã:**  You are *exempt* from tax in the host country, not necessarily taxed by your home country (although that may be the case depending on your home country's laws).
* **D: Oimeháme umi tarifa sa’ivehápe:** This is irrelevant to diplomatic immunity.  Tax rates are about *paying* taxes, and diplomats are often exempt.

(Countries with horticultural exhibitions showcase language about plants, botanical varieties, and things to improve agriculture.) This directly relates to showcasing agricultural products and innovations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While a world fair *can* showcase a country's culture, the passage focuses more on the *what* is showcased (agriculture, horticulture) than the culture itself.
* **C:** The passage mentions the fairs last 3-5 days and cover 50 hectares, but this isn’t the *main* point of what makes them world fairs.
* **D:** The passage implies countries *do* participate, it doesn't say they aren’t required to.

(Countries present their products and innovations, and countries collaborate to showcase culture and world advancements.)  This directly supports the idea that the fair is designed for participation from many nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the fair *does* showcase a country's culture and what exists on Earth, that's a result of the participation, not the defining *rule* of a World Expo.
* **B:** The passage mentions it doesn't happen every year and may move locations, but that’s a characteristic, not a rule.
* **C:** The passage states the fairs last a few months, not just one month.

Mavaitépa ojejapórõpa ikatu sa’ive mymba oporombeti ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ani emongy'a campamento** (Don't set up camp).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...upévare eñeha’ã ani egueraha tembi’u hyakuã mbaretéva ha **ani emongy’a campamento**."" ( ""...therefore it is recommended not to bring attractive food and **not to set up camp**."")  This is a direct recommendation to avoid attracting dangerous animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojeguerekova’erã umi ka’avo hyakuãporãva** (Bring good quality shoes) - This isn't related to avoiding animal encounters.
* **C: Eñemomombyry va’erã lobo-gui ha 25 yardas / metros** (Stay 100 yards/meters away from bears and 25 yards/meters from other animals) - While this is a *part* of staying safe, it's a distance recommendation, not a preventative measure to *make* animals less likely to approach.
* **D: Oñembopy’aguapy umi mymba tembi’u rembyre rupive** (Be calmed by the smell of animal food) - This makes no sense and is the opposite of what the text suggests.

Mavaitépa ko’ã apytégui ndoje’éi pe pehẽnguépe ikatuha ha’e peteĩ causa oñembetiha pe teko ka’aguy?,"The correct answer is **A: Hyakuã mbaretéva (Strong smells)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hi’ári, eikuaa va’erã mba’e ryakuã ogueruha oso ha ambue mymbakuéra ñarõme, upévare eñeha’ã ani egueraha tembi’u hyakuã mbaretéva ha ani emongy’a campamento.""  This translates to: ""It is known what smells attract bears and other dangerous animals, therefore it is recommended not to carry strong-smelling food and not to smell strongly in the campsite.""

The passage emphasizes that strong smells attract dangerous animals, making it a *cause* of encounters in the wilderness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Noñeñemombyrýi (Not being careful):** While carelessness contributes to danger, the passage identifies *what* attracts the animals in the first place.
* **C: Teko ka’aguy ñemongarúvo (Wilderness being dangerous):**  This is a general statement, not a specific cause of animal encounters. The passage focuses on *why* the wilderness is dangerous in this context.
* **D: Heta mymba ndojepokuaái ohecha yvypóra (Many animals don't see people):** This is not a cause of encounters, and even contradicts the text which explains animals *do* encounter people.
