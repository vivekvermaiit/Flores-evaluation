"anuchhed anusar, kun MySpace suvidhaley padhna samasya vayeka vidyarthiharulai faidajanak huna sakchha?","The correct answer is **A: anukulan** (adaptation/adjustment).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kiboardko prayog wa hizzeka sath samasya bhogne vidyarthiharuka lagi yaad garna sajilo ra type garna sajilo banaunale yass prishthalai sajilaisanga web thegana pradan garera pahunch garna sakinchha. **Yasalai padhna sajilo garauna ra chaheanusarko dherai wa come rangle anukulan garna sakinchha.**"" 

This translates to: ""This platform makes it easy to remember and type for students who have trouble with keyboard use or spelling. **It can also be adapted to make reading easier and accommodate many spelling errors.**""

Therefore, the *adaptation* feature (anukulan) is the specific MySpace benefit mentioned as helpful for students with reading difficulties.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: blogharu (blogs):**  While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn't link them to helping students with reading problems.
* **C: ek web thegana (a web address):** Having a web address is a general benefit, not specifically for reading difficulties.
* **D: 54 million profileharu (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is a statistic, not a feature that aids reading."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun khruschchebhle majdur ko dangako pratikriyako bhaag hoina?","सही उत्तर **C: jyala katauti ma bridhi** हो।

अनुच्छेदमा भनिएको छ कि मजदुरहरूले खाद्य अभाव र ज्याला कटौतीको विरोध गरेका थिए। तर, क्रुश्चेवले उनीहरूलाई दबाउन ट्यांक पठाए, केही आर्थिक मागहरू स्वीकार गरे र नयाँ प्रधानमन्त्री नियुक्त गरे। यसले देखाउँछ कि ज्याला कटौतीको विरोधलाई क्रुश्चेवले दबाउने प्रयास गरे, तर त्यसलाई समाधानको रूपमा स्वीकार गरेन। त्यसकारण, ज्याला कटौतीमा वृद्धि क्रुश्चेवले मजदुरको दंगाको प्रतिक्रियाको भाग होइन।

अन्य विकल्पहरू सही छन्:

*   **A: euta naya pradhan mantri niyukta garney** - क्रुश्चेवले लेडीस्लाभ गोमुल्कालाई नयाँ प्रधानमन्त्री नियुक्त गरे।
*   **B: wyawasthako punarsthapana garna tankharuko prayog** - क्रुश्चेवले व्यवस्था पुनर्स्थापित गर्न ट्यांक प्रयोग गरे।
*   **D: kehi arthik magharu swikar garnu** - क्रुश्चेवले केही आर्थिक मागहरू स्वीकार गरे।"
nimna madhey kun polandko dangako karan hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Władysław Gomułka's appointment**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Gomułka's appointment was a *result* of the protests**, a concession made by Khrushchev. It wasn't a *cause* of the Polish unrest.
* **A: Communism:** The protests were a public opposition *against* communist rule.
* **B: Food shortages:** The passage explicitly mentions protests against food shortages (""khadyanna abhawa"").
* **C: Wage cuts:**  The passage explicitly mentions protests against wage cuts (""jyala katauti"").

Therefore, Gomułka's appointment was a response *to* the other factors, not a cause *of* the unrest.

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley USSR ra sanyukta rajya america bichko sambandhalai asar garena?","Correct answer is **B: germany ko bare vichar**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly mentions these factors as contributing to the deterioration of the relationship between the USSR and the USA:

*   **Sanskritik bhinnata (Cultural differences):** The text states ""sanskritiko jhagadale desh pathan bhayo"" (cultural clashes led the countries astray).
*   **Viparit prakriya (Opposing systems):**  The text refers to ""yuddhako antyasangai pranali"" (systems after the end of the war), implying differing ideologies.
*   **Pranaliharu sambandhit vivad (Disagreements regarding ideologies/systems):** This is directly linked to the ""pranali"" mentioned above.

However, the paragraph **doesn't** mention any issues related to ""germany ko bare vichar"" (thoughts about Germany) as a factor affecting the USSR-USA relationship. While Germany was a common enemy initially, the text focuses on what happened *after* the war, and how the former allies became rivals."
nimna madhey kunley shariribhari snayu bhabharu pathaunako uddeshyalai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **A: ragat babhaw lai dhilo banauna (to make blood flow slow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the sympathetic nervous system.** This system *increases* blood flow to muscles, prepares the body for ""fight or flight,"" and helps maintain homeostasis by responding to threats.  It does **not** slow down blood flow.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: ragat babhaw vyawasthit garna (to regulate blood flow)** - The passage states the nervous system sends signals throughout the body and can help regulate blood flow.
* **C: homostasis vyavasthit garna (to regulate homeostasis)** - The passage explicitly states the system is involved in homeostasis.
* **D: sambhawit sharirik khatra bata joginu (to protect from potential physical danger)** - The passage says the system helps protect the body from potential dangers.

Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts the function described in the passage.



"
giza patharma ke pauna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **D: great pyramid**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Egyptko bhyali off da deadko giza pathar wa """"gija necropolis"""" maa thuprai piramidharu awasthit chan (jasmadhye da great pyramid sabaibhanda thulo ho), dherai sanah chihanharu, dherai mandirharu ra great sphinx chan.""

This directly translates to: ""On the outskirts of Egypt, on the Giza plateau, or the ""Giza necropolis,"" several pyramids are located (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), many monuments, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.""

Therefore, the Giza plateau is where you can find the Great Pyramid.



"
great pyramidko uddeshya ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: pharaoh laai samman garnako lagi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Great pyramid mrityu bhaeka faraolai samman garnako lagi nirmit dherai thulla pyramid sanrachanaharu madhye ek ho."" (Great pyramid was built to honor the deceased pharaohs among many large pyramid structures).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: saatawata ashcharya madhye euta hunu** - While true, being a wonder of the world isn't the *purpose* of its construction.
*   **C: aitihashik sthalko rupma kaam garna** - The text doesn't suggest this was its primary purpose.
*   **D: mrityu bhayeka manisharuko chihan bhandar garna** - While it contains tombs, the primary purpose was to honor the pharaoh specifically, not just any deceased person.



"
mandir dhwasta banauney ago lagauney manisko pahichan huney gyanko jimmewar ko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: efficienharu** (the officials).

The text explicitly states: ""akroshit efficienharule herostratasko name kahilyai pani record garine chhaina bhanera ghoshana gare."" (The angry officials declared they wouldn't even record Herostratus's name.) This implies they were responsible for the decision *not* to acknowledge the person who burned the temple, and by extension, were aware of who that person was.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raja alekjender** (King Alexander) - He *offered* to rebuild the temple, he didn't destroy it.
* **C: starbo** (Strabo) - He was a historian who *recorded* the event, he didn't cause it.
* **D: artemis** (Artemis) - She is the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not the arsonist.



"
artemis mandirko punanirman sambandhiko kun kathan sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **B: tyo Raja alekjenderko shasanpachhi punanirman gariyeko thiyo** (It was rebuilt after the reign of King Alexander).

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""pachhi, alekjenderko mrityu bhaepachi, 323 BCE ma mandirko punarnirman gariyo."" (After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE). This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: punanirmanko kharcha Raja alekjender tire** (The cost of reconstruction was borne by King Alexander): The text says Alexander *offered* to pay but his proposal was *rejected*.
*   **C: punanirmanko kharchaharu herostratuslai tirna lagayeko thiyo** (The reconstruction costs were to be paid by Herostratus): The text does not mention Herostratus being involved in paying for the reconstruction.
*   **D: tyo 320 BCE ma punanirman gariyeko thiyo** (It was rebuilt in 320 BCE): The text clearly states it was rebuilt in **323 BCE**.



"
"anuchhed anusar, prajatiharuley dui khuttama hideko sabaibhanda pahila kahiley thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: sattari laakh warsha agadi (seven million years ago)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...sahelenthropas saat million warsha aghadi nai dui khuttama hindeka huna sakdachhan."" This translates to ""...Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.""

Therefore, according to the passage, the species potentially walked on two legs earliest around seven million years ago.



"
yi madhey kun prajati niyamit dui khuttama hindthyo?,"The correct answer is **A: sahelenthropas**.

The text states: ""...sahelenthropas saat million warsha aghadi nai dui khuttama hindeka huna sakdachhan."" which translates to ""...sahelenthropus may have been walking on two legs even seven million years ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: thado manis (Homo erectus):** The text says they *became* bipedal two million years ago, not that they were initially bipedal.
* **C: dwipadiya visheshagyataharu (bipedal specialists):** This refers to characteristics found in fossils, not a specific species.
* **D: astrelopithecus:** The text states *evidence* of bipedalism is found in Astrelopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but doesn't say they were initially bipedal.



"
WWII ko bela germanyko navyley ke prapta garna prayash gariraheko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: belayatbata ayeka samanharulai awarodh garnu** (To blockade supplies coming from Britain).

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy was trying to ""rokne prayas gardai thiyo"" (trying to stop) the traffic of men and materials the Americans were sending to support Britain.  This means their goal was to prevent supplies *from* Britain *reaching* their destination.  ""Awarodh garnu"" means to blockade or obstruct, which perfectly describes their objective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: belayatlai manisharu ra samanharu prapta garnabata rokna** (To prevent Britain from receiving people and supplies) - While related, the German navy wasn't trying to prevent Britain from *receiving* generally, but specifically to stop the *flow* of aid from America.
* **C: atlantic paari samagriharu dhuwani garna** (To send materials across the Atlantic) - This is what the *Allies* were trying to do, not the Germans.
* **D: americalai manisharu ra samanharu prapta garnabata rokna** (To prevent America from receiving people and supplies) - The Germans weren’t directly targeting America; they were targeting the supplies America was sending to Britain.



"
"anuchhedma diyeko jaankari anusar, uttar atlantic abhiyanko samayma naval yuddhama kasle sabai bhanda dherai safalta payo?","The correct answer is **B: germanharu** (Germans).

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy (primarily using U-boats) *tried* to stop the traffic of men and supplies across the Atlantic. While the passage doesn't explicitly state who was more successful, it implies the Germans were a significant threat, stating ""if the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as well."" This suggests the Germans were having success disrupting the Allied efforts. The passage frames the situation as the Allies struggling against the German attempts to block traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: belayeti ra amerikiharu (British and Americans):** The passage states they were *trying* to get supplies across, but also implies they were facing difficulties.
*   **C: germanharu ra belayeti (Germans and British):** The passage doesn't present the British as particularly successful in this context, focusing on the German disruption.
*   **D: belayeti (British):**  Similar to option A, the British were involved in the effort, but the passage highlights the German challenge to that effort.



"
asarianharule ghodasawar fauj prayog ko suruwat garda ke ko astitwa thiyena?,"The correct answer is **A: kathi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tyo belasamma kathi awishkar bhaeko thiena, tyasaile assyrian ashwadle ghoda nango dhadma basera yuddha ladyo."" (At that time, swords hadn't been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought by hitting with clubs while on horseback.)

This directly implies that *before* the Assyrians used cavalry, swords did *not* exist. They used clubs instead.  Therefore, the question ""Assyrian cavalry began to be used when what did not exist?"" is answered by ""kathi"" (swords).



"
ghodasawar fauj prayog garney yuddhaharu kasari ladincha?,"The correct answer is **C: ghodasawar garera**.

The text explicitly states that the Assyrians were the first to use cavalry (mounted warriors) – ""pahilo ghodasawar fauj"" and describes them fighting ""ghoda chadhera yuddha"" (fighting riding horses). Therefore, battles involving cavalry were fought *riding horses* (ghodasawar garera).
"
"anuchhed anusar, tapailey sadharan babylonian nagarik kaha fela garnu hunna?","The correct answer is **C: mandirko anganko utsavma** (at the festival in the temple courtyard).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pratyek mandirma euta khula aangan thiyo..."" (Each temple had an open courtyard...) and ""Manisharule dewataharulai baliharu lyaunthe ra pujariharule dharmakriya ra chadaparwaharumarfat dewataharuko awashyaktaharu pura gurney prayas gardathe."" (People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs through religious rituals and offerings).  This implies people participated in activities *in the open courtyard*, bringing sacrifices and observing rituals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mandirko anganma baliharu lyaudai gareko awasthama** (while bringing sacrifices in the temple courtyard) - While they *brought* sacrifices to the courtyard, the text doesn’t say they *stayed* there while doing so. They brought them *to* the priests.
* **B: mukhya mandirma samharoma upasthit bhayeko** (present in the main temple assembly) - The passage doesn't mention any main temple assemblies.
* **D: bhitri mandirma baliharu lyaudai gareko** (bringing sacrifices in the inner temple) - The passage explicitly states: ""kewal pujariharu bhitra pasna paaunthe"" (only priests were allowed inside).  Ordinary citizens couldn’t enter the inner temple.



"
nimna madhey kun vishesh garera pujariharuko lagi thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: bhitri mandirharu** (inner temples).

The text states: ""Pratyek mandirma euta khula aangan thiyo ra tyasapachhi bhitri mandir thiyo jasma kewal pujariharu bhitra pasna paaunthe."" This directly translates to ""Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner temple where only priests were allowed to enter.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: utsavharu** (festivals) - The text mentions rituals and offerings, but doesn't specifically link festivals to being *for* the priests.
*   **C: samharoharu** (ceremonies) - While ceremonies were performed *by* priests, the text doesn't state the ceremonies themselves were specifically *for* them.
*   **D: ziggurat** - Ziggurats were a part of the temple complex, but weren't exclusively for the priests' use. They were a specific architectural feature.



"
raja tutankhamunley kahiley kukhyaat bhaye?,"The correct answer is **C: unko chihan khoj pachi** (after his tomb was discovered).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadyapi, 1922 co unko chihanko khojle unlai prasidha banayo."" This translates to ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: afno chihan lutie pachi** (after his tomb was looted) - While the passage mentions looting, it states the *discovery* made him famous, not the looting itself.
*   **B: afule raaj garda** (while he was ruling) - The passage doesn't suggest he was famous *during* his reign, but rather after his tomb was found.
*   **D: prachin rajaharuko suchima ullekhit vaye pachi** (after being mentioned in the list of ancient kings) - The passage mentions he was an important king, but his fame came from the tomb discovery.



"
ek kuraley raja tutankhamunlai prakhyat egyptian raja banayo?,"The correct answer is **A: unko chihan lai kehi nagari chhodieko thiyo** (the fact that some cities left his symbol).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadyapi, 1922 co unko chihanko khojle unlai prasidha banayo.""  This directly translates to ""However, the discovery of his symbol in 1922 made him famous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: prachin rajaharuko suchima unko darja** (his position in the list of ancient kings) - The passage says he was important, but the discovery of his tomb *made* him famous, not his prior listing.
* **C: unko chihanbata hajaraun kalakriti haru ko chori** (the theft of thousands of artifacts from his symbol) - The passage mentions looting, but says the tomb was *well-preserved* despite it, and it wasn't the theft that *made* him famous.
* **D: egyptian samayako bela unko mahatwa** (his importance during the Egyptian period) - The passage mentions he was important in ancient times, but again, it was the *discovery* that brought him modern fame.



"
greek kavi homerley ke garna sakdaina thiye?,"Correct answer is **B: dekhna (to see)**.

The passage explicitly states Homer was a blind poet (""netrahin kavi""). Therefore, he couldn't see.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sunna (to hear):** Being blind doesn't affect one's ability to hear.
*   **C: hidna (to walk):** Being blind doesn't necessarily prevent walking.
*   **D: bolna (to speak):** Being blind doesn't affect one's ability to speak."
kun prasiddha greeklai sahitya bahek aru kurakolagi chinincha?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Arka prasidha greek ganitagya Pythagoras hun jo mukhya rupma samakoni trikonka kunaharuko sambandhaharu barema afno prakhyat sadhyaka lagi parichit chan."" (Another famous Greek mathematician is Pythagoras who is known for his famous theorem about the relationships between the angles of a right triangle). This clearly identifies Pythagoras as famous for something *other* than literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sophocals** - The passage describes him as a playwright (related to literature).
* **B: Homer** - The passage explicitly states he's a poet (related to literature).
* **D: Aaristophens** - Also described as a playwright (literature).



"
hibru pariwarley uniharuko dherai jasto samay kaha bitauthiye?,"The correct answer is **A: khula hawama** (in the open air).

The passage states: ""Hibru pariwarko adhikansh jeevan khula hawa bitthyo."" which translates to ""Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.""

Therefore, the answer is A.



"
hibru pariwarma ke dherai mahatwapurna thiyena?,"The correct answer is **A: uniharuko mausam (their weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hibru pariwarko adhikansh jeevan khula hawa bitthyo."" This translates to ""Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air."" This directly indicates that the weather was very important to them, as their lives revolved around it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: uniharuko dokan (their shops):** The passage mentions stores having open counters, but doesn't say the shops themselves were central to family life.
*   **C: uniharuko ghar (their homes):** While homes are mentioned, the focus is on *how* they lived (outdoors) rather than the homes themselves.
*   **D: uniharuko pakai (their cooking):** Cooking is mentioned as happening outdoors, but it's a *result* of the weather being important, not the core importance itself.



"
nimna madhey kelai scandinavian deshharu bichko bhinnata vanera varnan gariyeko chaina?,"The correct answer is **B: jamin (land)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions differences in:

* **Itihas (history):** ""itihaska bichma dherai bhinnataharu thee""
* **Ritithiti (customs/traditions):** ""ritithiti ra itihaska bichma dherai bhinnataharu thee""
* **Manisharu (people):** ""denmark, swiden, nervey ra aislandka manis..."" - highlights different people from different countries.

However, the passage *doesn't* discuss geographical differences (land/jamin) between the Scandinavian countries. It only states they all fall under the ""Scandinavian"" umbrella.

Therefore, **jamin (land)** is the element *not* described as differing between the Scandinavian countries in the passage.



"
greenlandma pratham kasle basobas gare?,"The correct answer is **A: eskimo adiwasiharu**.

The passage states: ""tyas samayama eskimo adiwasiharu bhane pahilyai tyahan basiraheka thee"" which translates to ""at that time, Eskimo indigenous people were the first to reside there."" 

While Erich the Red is mentioned as visiting Greenland, the text specifically says the Eskimo people were already living there when he arrived. The other options (Norway/Nerveyli, Sweden) are mentioned as Scandinavian countries with differences, but not as the first inhabitants of Greenland.



"
kun samuhaley bina kursi khana mann paraaunthe?,"The correct answer is **D: garib roman mahilaharu** (poor Roman women).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arko bhinnata jab garib manis ra mahilaharule kursima baser afno khana khanthe, dhani manisharu sangai bhoj garna mann paraaunthe jahaan tiniharule khana khaepachhi afno chheuma aaram garthe.""  This translates to: ""Another difference was that poor men and women ate their food sitting on the ground, while rich people preferred to eat with the rich where they could rest comfortably after eating.""

Therefore, poor Roman women are the group described as eating without chairs.



"
nimna madhey ke purano roman bhojharuko bhag hunthena?,"The correct answer is **D: roast gariyeko turkeyko thal (a platter of roasted turkey)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""kunai pani prachin romanle kahilyai turkey chakhena"" - meaning ancient Romans did *not* eat turkey. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: garib pahunaharu kursima basera khairaheko (poor guests sitting on chairs to eat)** - The text mentions this as a contrast to how rich people ate, so it *was* a part of Roman dining.
*   **B: sankhyekiraharuko appetizer (appetizer of dormice)** - The text specifically lists dormice as one of the ""vichitra wa anautha jiwaharu"" (strange and unique animals) Romans ate.
*   **C: dhani purushharu ratko khanako samay paltiraheko (wealthy men reclining at dinner)** - The text describes this as a practice of the wealthy.



"
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhye kun kurale dirgakalin prabhaav pardaina?","The correct answer is **B: alpasankhyak sanskriti**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Alpasankhyak sanskritiharu pry: kunai sandarbhik aitihasik praman nachhodi haraunchhan ra uchit sabhyataharuko rupma parichit hoon asafal hunchhan."" This translates to: ""Minority cultures often lack concrete historical evidence and fail to be recognized in the form of proper civilizations.""  This means minority cultures don't typically have a lasting (dirgakalin) influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ek samaj (a society):** Societies are foundational to civilizations and are inherently impacted by them.
*   **C: ek sahari-rajya (a city-state):** The passage identifies city-states *as preceding* nations and being connected to the roots of civilization.
*   **D: ek sabhyata ko sanskriti (a civilization's culture):**  A civilization *is* defined by its culture, so the culture fundamentally *has* a lasting impact.



"
"anuchhed anusar, rashtra bhanda pahile ke auncha?","The correct answer is **C: ek sahari-rajya (a city-state)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nagar-rajyaharu rashtraharuka agradutharu hun."" This translates to ""City-states are predecessors to nations.""  Therefore, according to the passage, city-states came before nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ek sabhyata ko sanskriti (a civilization's culture):** The passage defines civilization, but doesn't say culture comes *before* nations.
*   **B: ekal sanskriti (a single culture):**  While related to civilization, it's not specifically stated as coming before nations.
*   **D: alpasankhyak sanskritiharu (minority cultures):** The passage states these often *fail* to become recognized as part of a civilization, so they wouldn't come before nations.



"
Drukgyal jong barey kun kathan satya hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: tyasko nirman tibeti-mongol senako vijay manauna garieko thiyo** (Its construction was to celebrate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol army).

Here's why:

The passage states Drukgyal Jong was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel **to commemorate his victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol army.**  Option A incorrectly states it was *to celebrate* the Tibetan-Mongol army.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: yo bhutanma awasthit cha** (This is located in Bhutan) - The passage specifically states it's in Paro district, Bhutan.
* **C: ago ley killako dherai awasheshharu dhwasta banayo** (Fire destroyed many of the fortress's remains) - The passage mentions fire in 1951 damaged much of the structure.
* **D: tyo zhabdrung ngawang namgyel dwaara srijana garieko thiyo** (It was created by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - The passage clearly states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress.



"
kun kathanley sahi tarikaley Drukgyal jongma vayeko agolagiko varnan gardacha?,"The correct answer is **A: baaki vayeko awashesh zhadbrung ngawang namagyalko tasvir thiyo** (The remaining ruins were a portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sun 1951 maa, agalagile drukgyal dongka kehi awasheshharu jastai jabdrang gawang namagyalko chhawi pratima matri baaki rahe."" This directly translates to ""In 1951, after the fire, only a few ruins remained, including a portrait statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tibeti-mongol senaharu vijayi bhaekaa thiye** (The Tibetan-Mongol army was victorious) - The passage says Drukgyal Jong was built to *commemorate a victory* *against* the Tibetan-Mongol army, not their victory.
* **C: tyo thauko prasiddhima kehi asar vayena** (It had little effect on the fame of the place) - The passage implies the opposite – it was one of Bhutan’s most important attractions.
* **D: tyo zhabdrung ngawang namgyeldwara surakshit gariyeko thiyo** (It was protected by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel) - While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *built* the fort, the passage doesn't state he actively protected the ruins after the fire, only that they were later preserved.



"
nimna madhey combodia bare kun kathan satya ho?,"The correct answer is **A: bhiyatnami harule phnom phen dhwasta pare** (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bhiyatnamiharule pani combodiama 18 aun shatabdika antimatira bhiyatanamiharule pani combodiama akraman gare."" (The Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia towards the end of the 18th century.)  While it doesn't *directly* say they destroyed Phnom Penh, it's implied in the context of attacks. More importantly, the passage specifically states that **Thaiharule 1772 maa Phnom Phen dhwasta pare** (The Thais destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772), so the Vietnamese *also* attacking Cambodia around the same time strengthens the possibility of damage to the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: combodialey 1772 ma thylandlai akraman garyo** (Cambodia attacked Thailand in 1772) - The passage states Thailand attacked Cambodia.
* **C: combodia maa 18aun satabdiko suruwatma bhiyatnamdwaara akraman vayeko thiyo** (Cambodia was attacked by Vietnam at the beginning of the 18th century) - The passage says the Vietnamese attacks were towards the *end* of the 18th century.
* **D: thyharuley phnom phen dhwasta pare** (They destroyed Phnom Penh) -  ""They"" is ambiguous.  The passage specifically names the Thais as the ones who destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.



"
nimna madhey kun kathanharuley combodiako akramanharulai sahi tarikaley varnan gardacha?,"The correct answer is **B: thyharu ra bhiyatnami le 1772 ma combodiama aakraman gare**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Thaiharule 18 aun shatabdima dherai patak combodiama akraman gare ra tiniharule 1772 maa Phnom Phen dhwasta pare. Bhiyatanamiharule pani combodiama 18 aun shatabdika antimatira bhiyatanamiharule pani combodiama akraman gare."" (The Thais repeatedly invaded Cambodia in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772. The Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia at the end of the 18th century.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bhiyatnami harule combodia ma dherai patak akraman gare** - While true, it doesn't mention the Thais, and option B is *more* complete.
* **C: bhiyatnami harule phnom phen dhwasta pare** - The passage says the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **D: thyharuley dherai patak combodia akraman gare** - While true, it doesn't mention the Vietnamese, and option B is *more* complete.



Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information given in the passage regarding both the Thais and Vietnamese invasions of Cambodia."
douch east india companyley uniharu taiwanma vayeko samayma nimna madhey ke garenan?,"The correct answer is **D: taiwanko niyantran swaichya ching samrajyalai dieyo** (giving control of Taiwan to the Qing dynasty themselves).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624.** They focused on studying native grain production and hiring Chinese laborers for sugar and other crops.
* **It was the Qing Dynasty (in 1683) who took control of Taiwan**, not the Dutch East India Company giving it to them. The Dutch were eventually ousted.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, according to the passage:

* **A: tapuko dakshin paschimi bhagma ek adhar ko nirmaan** (establishing a base in the southwestern part of the island) - The passage explicitly mentions this.
* **B: adivasi anaj utpadanko abhyas** (studying native grain production) - The passage states they studied this.
* **C: tesko khetharuma chiniyan majdurharulai kaamma rakhee** (hiring Chinese laborers in their fields) - The passage also explicitly states this.



"
shimonoseki sandhiley ke sthapana garyo?,"Correct answer is **D: japanko taiwan mathiko adhikar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...yasale taiwanko swamitwa japanlai sumpiyo, jasle 1945 samma tapuma shason garyo."" This directly translates to ""it transferred ownership of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pahilo sino-japani yuddhama japanko haar:** The text says China *lost* the war, not Japan.
*   **B: ching samrajya muni rajyako rupma taiwanko manyata:** The text details how the Qing dynasty *controlled* Taiwan, it doesn't mention recognition of it as a state.
*   **C: tyasko samudri ksetraharuko niyantra firta lina taiwanko kshamata:** The text doesn't discuss naval control or Taiwan's capability in that regard.

Prakashit granthama spast pariwari dinuchha ki hydrogen ionharu proton ho (hydrogen parmanuma euta proton ra euta electron hune bhae).

The passage explicitly states that hydrogen ions are protons (since a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron). Therefore, the correct answer is **A: protonharu**."

kharayoharu kasto prakarko shikariharuko lagi shikar hunchan?,"The correct answer is **C: madhyam-akarka biraloharu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kharayodekhi harin ra mrigasamma madhyam akarko shikar garna sakne praniantargat dherai madhyam akarka biraloharu parchhan."" 

This translates to: ""From kharayo to deer and antelope, many medium-sized cats prey on animals that can be hunted by medium-sized predators.""

Therefore, kharayo (and similar animals) are prey for medium-sized cats.



"
sana biraloharuley samanyata nimna madhey kun shikar garchan?,"The correct answer is **A: musaharu (mice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Antyama, kira, rodent, chheparo ra charaharu jasta ajha dherai anaginat saas-sanah shikar khane (khulla paltu biralaharu sahit) dherai sanah biralaharu chan.""  This translates to ""Finally, many small cats hunt countless small breathing prey (including outdoor/feral cats) like insects, rodents, reptiles and birds."" Rodents include mice.

The passage also discusses larger prey like deer (harin) and gazelles (mrigasamma), but specifically mentions *small* cats hunting *small* prey.  The other options (deer, gazelles) are mentioned as prey for *larger* cats.



"
nimna madhey kun oselotko shikar garney vidhiko bhag hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: tiniharule shikarko gandha pacchaunu** (they smell their prey).

Here's why:

The passage states ocelots rely on:

*   **Sight:** ""ratko drishtika sath andhakarma prasht dekhna sakdachhan"" (can see in low light)
*   **Stealth:** ""ra dherai chupchap bhaera pani sarna sakdachhan"" (and can move very silently)
*   **Ambush:** ""tiniharule tiniharuko shikarko asapasko kshetraka sath misiera ra shikar mathi jhamtiera shikar gardachan"" (they blend into the area near their prey and pounce on them)

The passage **does not** mention ocelots using their sense of smell to locate prey.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: tiniharule vatavaranma bhesh badalnu** (they camouflage themselves in the environment) -  This is implied by ""misiera"" (blend in).
*   **C: tiniharule rati shikarko pachi garnu** (they hunt prey at night) - This is stated directly: ""ratko drishtika"" (night vision).
*   **D: kewal sano akarka janawarharuko shikar garne** (they only hunt small animals) - This is stated: ""Osalatle shikar gurney lagbhag sabai janawarharu yo bhanda sano hunchhan"" (The prey of ocelots are almost always animals smaller than them).



"
nimna madhey kunley oselotko sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina? ,"The correct answer is **C: tiniharuko sungney shakti kamjor hunchha** (their sense of smell is weak).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vaigyanikharule sochdachhan key oselotharule janawarharulai khan (shikar) garna uniharu baseko thaunma sunghera patta lagaunchhan."" This translates to ""Scientists think ocelots use their sense of smell to locate animals to hunt.""  Therefore, their sense of smell is *not* weak; it's actually important for hunting.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the text:

* **A: tiniharu rati ramrosita shikar garna sakchhan** (they can hunt well at night) - The text mentions ""ratko drishtika sath andhakarma prasht dekhna sakdachhan"" (they can see well in the dark at night).
* **B: tiniharu chupchap bhaera hiddul garna sakdachhan** (they can hide quietly) - The text states ""ra dherai chupchap bhaera pani sarna sakdachhan"" (and can move very quietly).
* **D: tiniharuley sano janawarharu ko shikar garna ruchauchan** (they like to hunt small animals) - The text says they hunt ""bandar, sarpa, musa ra charaharu"" (monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds) and that their prey is generally smaller than themselves.



"
nimna madhey kun baghko sabaibhanda thulo manindaina?,"The correct answer is **D: taannu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the tiger can lift five times its weight (""paanch gauna badhi balle tanna sakdachha"").  ""Tanna"" means to lift or weigh. The other options don't relate to physical strength or size:

*   **Gajran (A):** Roaring. The passage describes *how* a tiger roars, but not its size.
*   **Chadhnu (B):** Climbing. While the passage mentions tigers can climb, it doesn't tell us which action defines its size.
*   **Hamfalnu (C):** To attack. Again, relates to behavior, not size.

Therefore, the ability to lift five times its weight is the characteristic that best indicates the tiger's substantial size and strength.



"
"anuchhed anusar, yi madhey kun bagh ra sinha bichko bhinatta ho?","The correct answer is **B: tiniharuko garjanako awaj** (their roaring sound).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Baghko garjan sinhako purna awajko garjan jasto hundaina, tar badhi jasto chidchida, charko shabdaharuko wakya jastai hunchha."" (A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-bodied roar, but rather like a grating, a series of harsh sounds.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tiniharuko paudhi khelney khubi** (their climbing ability) - The passage states both tigers and lions climb well.
*   **C: tiniharule hamfalney duri** (the distance they can jump) - The passage mentions a tiger can jump five times further than a strong man, but doesn't compare it to a lion's jump.
*   **D: tiniharuko taanna sakne shakti** (their strength) - The passage states a tiger is five times stronger than a strong man, but doesn't mention the lion's strength in comparison.



"
"anuchhed anusar, anya jiwavaigyanikharu bhanda aghi rober hookeley ke gare?","The correct answer is **A: mrit koshanuko awalokan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""uni mrit koshharu awalokan gurney pahilo wyakti thiye"" which translates to ""He was the first person to observe dead cells.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jiwa herna sukshmadarshak yantra ko prayog (using a microscope to see life):** While Hooke *used* a microscope, the text doesn't say he was the first to use it to see life.
* **C: sana vargaharu ko awalokan (observing small boxes):** He observed ""sanah warga,"" but the passage emphasizes he was the first to observe *dead cells* specifically. The small boxes were what the cells *looked like*.
* **D: jiwako sabaibhanda sano karya garney ekai ko khoj (discovering the smallest working unit of life):**  He didn't discover the fundamental working unit of life (that's the cell as we understand it now); he simply observed structures that resembled little rooms.



"
‘koshanu’ shabdako utpattiko artha ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: sano kotha** (small compartments).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sell bhane shabd sela namak latin shabdabata aeko ho jasko **earth sano kotha hunchha**."" This translates to ""The word 'cell' comes from the Latin word 'cella' which means **small room/compartment**.""

Therefore, the origin of the word 'koshanu' (cell) is linked to the idea of small, enclosed spaces, or small compartments.



"
"anuchhed anuaar, praya: janawarharusanga ke garney khubi huncha?","The correct answer is **B: halchal garne** (moving).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tiniharu bhuinma hidney, samudrama paudine ra akashma udchhan"" - which translates to ""they walk on land, swim in the ocean, and fly in the sky."" This encompasses all forms of movement.
* **While the other options are *mentioned* in the passage, they aren't the overarching characteristic:**
    * **A: udne (flying)** - only *some* animals fly.
    * **C: paudane (swimming)** - only *some* animals swim.
    * **D: khanne (eating)** -  While true, the passage also mentions other abilities.

The passage emphasizes the *variety* of how animals move, making ""halchal garne"" (moving) the best general answer.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kehi janawaharusanga ke hudaina?","The correct answer is **C: dimag** (brain).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kewal janawarharuko dimag hunchha (tathapi sabai janawarharusanga dimag hundaina; udaharanka lagi jellyfish).""  This translates to ""Only animals have brains (however, not all animals have brains; for example, jellyfish).""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says some animals *do not* have brains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kosh** (cells) - The passage says animals are *made of* cells, implying they all have them.
*   **B: pachan kshamata** (digestive ability) - The passage states animals ""eat things and digest them,"" so they all have this ability.
*   **D: khaney kshamata** (eating ability) -  The passage directly mentions animals ""eat things.""



"
biruwaharulai prakash sanshleshan prakriyama keley maddat gardacha?,"The correct answer is **D: surya** (sun).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Suryabata botabiruwaharule prakash sanshleshan garera uniharuko khana banaunchhan."" This translates to: ""Plants make their food through photosynthesis from the sun.""  

Therefore, the sun directly helps plants in the process of photosynthesis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: chhahari** (shadow) - Shadows block sunlight, hindering photosynthesis.
*   **B: janawarharu** (animals) - Animals benefit *from* plants, but don't help them with photosynthesis.
*   **C: khanekura** (food) - Food is a *result* of photosynthesis, not something that aids the process.



"
manavharuley kun kura swashbata bahira chodcha jun biruwaharuley swashbata bhitra linchan?,"The correct answer is **D: carbon dioxide**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Biruwaharule oxygen banaunchhan jun manawale shwas ferda linchha ra tiniharule carbon-dioxide linchhan june manawale fyankchhan (arthat, shwas fyankchhan).""  This translates to: ""Plants produce oxygen which humans inhale during breathing, and they take in carbon dioxide which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).""

Therefore, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which plants take in.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun udaharanley wikaskramko prakriyama awarodh puraucha?","The correct answer is **A: euta sano samuha naya sthanma fastauna asafal vayera (a small group failing to establish itself in a new location)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as a process where a population diverges into new species due to adapting to a different environment. This divergence *requires* the small group to successfully establish itself in a new environment and face different pressures.

*   **Option A** describes a failure to even *begin* that process. If the group can't establish itself, there's no opportunity for divergence, and therefore no speciation. It halts the evolutionary process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: janasankhyako euta bhag naya vatavaranma sarera (a part of the population moving into a new environment)** - This is the *start* of the speciation process, not an impediment to it.
*   **C: janasankhya le naya watawaranma samayojan huda (the population adapting to the new environment)** -  This is a *key step* in speciation. Adaptation drives the divergence.
*   **D: euta janasankhya duita banda (a population splitting into two)** - This is also a part of the initial process of speciation - the geographic separation that allows for divergence.



"
nimna madhey kun kathanley prajatikaran prakriyalai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina? ,"The correct answer is **A: yo naya janasankhya le samayojan garna nasakda huncha** (This new population may not be able to interbreed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that over long periods (thousands or millions of years), the two populations become *so* different they can no longer interbreed. This inability to interbreed is the **defining characteristic of speciation (prajatikaran)**.  Option A suggests they *might* not be able to interbreed, but the text implies it becomes a certainty.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **B: yo wikaskramko mahatwapurna pakshya ho** (This is an important aspect of evolution) - The text states ""prajatikaran ek apariharya parinam ho ra wikaskramko dherai mahatwapurna bhag ho"" (speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution).
*   **C: yesley naya prajatiko nirmanlai sambodhan garcha** (This addresses the creation of new species) - The entire passage explains how new species are formed through speciation.
*   **D: yo hunu aniwarya ho** (This is inevitable) -  The text states ""prajatikaran ek apariharya parinam ho"" (speciation is an inevitable result).



"
ragatsanchar pranaliko kun bhagley mututira ragat lyaucha?,"The correct answer is **A: dhamani**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ragat mutubata dhamani bhanine naliharuma janchha..."" which translates to ""Blood goes from the heart to the body through veins called arteries..."" 
* Therefore, arteries (dhamani) are the blood vessels that *carry* blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: keshikaharu (capillaries):** These are the smallest blood vessels and are where exchange of nutrients and waste happens, not where blood is *carried to* the heart.
* **C: angaharu (parts/limbs):** This is a general term and not a specific blood vessel.
* **D: nasa (veins):**  The text states veins (nasa) carry blood *from* the body *to* the heart, not to the heart.



"
ragatpranaliko sabaibhanda sano naliharu kun ho?,"The correct answer is **A: keshikaharu**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""sabaibhanda sanah nalilai keshika bhaninchha"" which translates to ""the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries (keshika).""

Therefore, the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system are capillaries (keshika)."
euta kirako pwakh paltauney khubiley nimna madhey ke kura bridhi garcha?,"The correct answer is **D: udney gati** (flying speed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hawa liney pahilo janawarharu kira thiye. uniharuko **udan gurney kshamatale** uniharulai satruharubata sajilai mukt garna ra khana ra jiwansathi ajha kushalatapurwak fella parna maddat gareko cha.""  (The first animals on Earth were insects. **Their ability to fly** helped them easily escape from enemies and skillfully search for food and livelihood.)

The question asks what greatly increases a bug's chance of survival when it changes its wings. Faster flight speed directly relates to better escape from predators and finding food, increasing survival chances.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: khanekurako apurti** (food shortage) - While important, the passage doesn't directly link wing changes to food shortages.
*   **B: lukney thaauharu** (hiding places) - The passage mentions hiding as a benefit of wings, but not *because* wings changed.
*   **C: jiwansathi fella parna** (searching for a mate) -  While flight aids in this, it's not the primary advantage highlighted in the context of wing evolution and survival.



"
nimna madhey kun kura kirako udney khubiley asar garney vanera ullekhit chaina?,"The passage discusses how wings help birds (and historically other creatures) escape predators and find food. It also mentions the ability to maneuver and find shelter. It *doesn't* mention anything about reproduction (prajanan), lifespan (aayu), or efficiency (dakshata) directly. While flight *can* indirectly help with these, the passage doesn't state it. It *does* mention finding food (khana batulna).

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: prajanan**.
"
nimna madhey kun viseshta samanyataya dianosarharusanga sambandhit hudaina?,"Correct answer: **D: nangra bhayeka khuttaharu**

Here's why:

The passage states that some creatures are described as having *tinka khuttama katla ra panja hunchhan* (three toes with claws).  Nangra bhayeka khuttaharu (blunt/rounded toes) wouldn't fit that description.

Let's look at why the other options *are* associated with dinosaurs (or the creatures being discussed as potentially surviving dinosaurs):

*   **A: pachhadiko-khuttabata hidnu** (walking on hind legs) - The text directly mentions they walk on two legs like a turkey.
*   **B: pwakhharu** (wings) - The passage states they have winged/can fly, which leads people to not think of them as dinosaurs.
*   **C: anda parnu** (laying eggs) - The passage explicitly states they lay eggs.



"
nimna madhey kun viseshta chara ra dianosarharu bich saman bhayeko manidaina?,"The correct answer is **C: udney khubi (ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that some dinosaurs are believed to still be alive and are referred to as birds. It specifically mentions that they have wings and *can fly*. This is a key difference between dinosaurs (generally thought of as not flying) and these surviving dinosaur relatives (birds).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: anda parnu (laying eggs)** - Both dinosaurs and birds lay eggs.
*   **B: pachadiko duita khutta hidna prayog garnu (using two legs to walk)** - The passage states the creatures walk like ducks, using their hind legs for support, suggesting both dinosaurs and these birds share this characteristic.
*   **D: nangra vayeka khuttaharu (clawed feet)** - The passage mentions claws, indicating that both dinosaurs and the described birds have them.



"
"anuchhed anusar, cycad biruwako kun bhag triceratopsley khana sakcha?","The correct answer is **A: kada vayeko paatharu** (hard, stony parts).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Triceratopka daantle patharu matra hoina, atyantai kada hanga ra jaraharusamma pani masalna sakthyo."" (Triceratops could not only crush stones but also grind very hard parts and roots.) And it specifically mentions they may have eaten cycads, which had ""teekha patharuko mukut"" (sharp, stony crowns). They used their strong beaks to break down these stony parts instead of the roots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kanda** (roots): The text explicitly says Triceratops preferred to break down the stony parts *instead* of the roots.
*   **C: jara** (roots): Same reason as above.
*   **D: phal** (fruits): The passage doesn't mention Triceratops eating the fruits of cycads, and the discussion focuses on the hard, stony parts.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey triceratopsley sabai bhanda dherai ke khana sakthyo? ","The correct answer is **B: kada hangaharu bhayeka biruwa** (plants with hard stems).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Triceratops daantle patharu matra hoina, atyantai kada hanga ra jaraharusamma pani masalna sakthyo."" This translates to ""Triceratops could crush not only stones but also very hard stems and roots.""  It specifically mentions their ability to break down tough, woody plant material.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sloth:** The passage mentions sloths *as an example* of animals that can eat large leaves and fruits, but doesn't say Triceratops ate like a sloth.
*   **C: suga:**  (meaning 'pig' in Nepali, referring to dinosaurs of the Suidae family) Similar to sloths, suga is mentioned as an example of an animal that can eat large leaves/fruit, not what Triceratops primarily ate.
*   **D: vishalu fal bhayeka biruwa:** (trees with large fruits) While some dinosaurs might eat fruit, the passage focuses on Triceratops' ability to deal with *hard stems*.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna khel madhey italyko uttari kshetrama ekdum prasidha huney khel kun ho?","The correct answer is **C: snowboarding**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Italionharule antarrashtriya tatha olympic pratiyogitaharuma pratispardha gare sangai **shitkalin khelharu uttari kshetraharuma jyadai lokpriya chan**."" (Italians compete in international and Olympic competitions, and **winter sports are very popular in the northern regions**).

Snowboarding is a winter sport. While football is mentioned as popular overall, the passage specifically links winter sports to the northern regions of Italy.  The other options (football, volleyball, F1 motor racing) aren't specifically mentioned as being popular in the northern regions in the text.



"
"anuchhedma diyeko jankariko adharma, nimna khel madhey italykolagi kun khel le vishwa pratiyogita jityo?","The correct answer is **A: football**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wishwako dosro sabaibhanda safal tolly italyko rashtriya football ra german rashtriya football tolly ho ra 2006 maa fifa vishwa cup champion thee.""  This directly translates to: ""Italy's national football team and Germany's national football team are the most successful teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.""

Therefore, Italy won a world competition in **football**.



"
kun ghatana pachi Lakjambargako kehi anshaharu belgiumko bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: belgiumko kranti** (Belgian Revolution).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Halka samayama belgiumka anshaharu vigatma lakjambargako ansh thee tar 1830 co dashakko belgian krantipachhi belgium banna pugyo."" This translates to ""For a short time, parts of Belgium were within Luxembourg, but after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s, Belgium was formed.""

Therefore, the Belgian Revolution is the event that led to Luxembourg losing those parts to Belgium.



"
nimna madhey kunley luxembargko tathastata lai asar garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: germanko kabza** (German occupation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Luxembergले पनि तटस्थ देश रहने प्रयास गरेको छ तर यो पहिलो र दोस्रो विश्वयुद्धमा जर्मनीद्वारा कब्जा गरिएको थियो।"" (Luxembourg also tried to remain a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany during the First and Second World Wars.)  This directly indicates the German occupation affected Luxembourg's neutrality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: europeli sanghko sadasya bhayera** (Becoming a member of the European Union) - While important, joining the EU *enhanced* Luxembourg's position, it didn't *affect* its neutrality.
* **C: belgiumko kranti** (The Belgian revolution) - The Belgian revolution is mentioned in the context of Luxembourg's history, but it didn't directly impact Luxembourg's neutrality.
* **D: euta swatantra desh bhayera** (Becoming an independent country) - Luxembourg *was* trying to be independent and neutral, but the German occupation compromised that.



"

This clearly indicates that Turkey has 23,764 square kilometers of territory in Europe.

The text states: ""Tarkiko kshetrafal 1,600 kilometer (1,000 mile) lambai ra 800 kimi (500 mile) chaudai, lagbhag ayatakar akarma raheko cha."" This translates to ""Turkey's area is approximately rectangular, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide.""

Therefore, Turkey is approximately 1000 miles long.



"
Bhyatikan siti ma latin bhasha keko lagi pragyo garincha?,"The correct answer is **A: dharmik samharoharu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Latin prayaha dharmik samarohaharuma prayog hunchha"" which translates to ""Latin is used in religious ceremonies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dainik sanchar:** The text says Italian is the daily language.
* **C: vidhan:** The text doesn't mention Latin being used for laws or constitutions.
* **D: adhikarik sanchar:** The text states Italian is used for official communication.



"
Bhyatikan siti ma italeli keko lagi prayog garindaina?,"The correct answer is **D: dainik sanchar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bhyatikan cityle yasako kanuni ra adhikarik sancharma italy bhashako prayog gardacha...italeli pani rajyama cam gurney dheraijasole prayog gurney gareko **dainik bhasha** ho.""  This directly translates to: ""Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications...Italian is also commonly used as the **daily language** in the state and around it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vidhan (constitution)** - The passage only mentions Italian is used in *official communications* (which could be part of the legal system, but isn't specifically stated as being used in the constitution).
*   **B: adhikarik sanchar (official communication)** -  While true, the question asks where Italian *is* used, and 'daily communication' is a broader and more complete answer given the text.
*   **C: dharmik samharoharu (religious ceremonies)** - The passage states Latin is used in religious ceremonies, not Italian.

*   **C: tasvirharu:** Computerharu tasvir process garna hunxa, but dhwani misauda ma faida hundaina.

"anuchhed anusar, prastut gariyeko kun sthanko adhikansa gharharuma flush garney shauchalayaharu thiye?","The correct answer is **A: mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states: ""Hadappa ra mohenjo-daro shaharharuka lagbhag sabai gharharuma ek parishkrit dhal nicas pranalisanga jodieko flush shauchalaya thiyo."" This translates to: ""Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an underground drainage system.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Persia:** The passage only mentions that Persia *had* toilets with water, not that they were in most homes.
*   **Santorini:** The passage says Santorini had remains of underground drainage systems, but doesn't mention flush toilets in most homes.
*   **Chin:** The passage only mentions Chin *had* toilets with water, not that they were in most homes.



"
nimna madhey kun sthanma vikasit dhal nicas pranali fela pareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hadappa ra mohenjo-daro shaharharuka lagbhag sabai gharharuma ek parishkrit dhal nicas pranalisanga jodieko flush shauchalaya thiyo."" (Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were connected to a sophisticated underground drainage system with flushing toilets.)

While the passage mentions drainage systems in Santorini and toilets in Egypt, Persia, and China, it highlights Harappa and Mohenjo-daro as having *developed* underground drainage systems.
"
nimna madhey kun karanley skater modcha?,"Correct answer is **A: skaterko bladeko tallo bhagko halka vakrakar**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bladko tallo bhag halka vakrakar bhaekale, blade ek chheuma wa arkotira dhalkine hunda, barafko samparkama reheko kinra pani bakra hunchha. Yasale skaterlai modnaka lagi sahayog gardacha."" (If the bottom part of the blade is slightly curved, the blade leans to one side or the other, and the edge in contact with the ice is also curved. This helps the skater turn.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: skateko bladema bhayeko dohoro kinara:** While the passage mentions double edges, it's the *curvature* of the blade that facilitates turning, not just the presence of two edges.
*   **C: skaterko samagra khubi star:** The passage doesn't discuss the skater's overall skill level.
*   **D: barafko gunastar:** The passage focuses on the skate design, not the ice quality."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley adhunik baraf skateko bladema bhayeko khokrolai sahi tarikaley varnan garchha?","Sahi jawab ho **A: dohoro-kinara**.

*   **D: jhukeko** - skate jhuknu thalpa, kinara hoina."
"anucched anusar, prakashbata parmanuharulai atirikta urja hatauna diney prakriyalai ke bhaninchha?","The correct answer is **D: wikiranko uttejit utsarjan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vaigyanikharule yass prakriyalai """"wikiranko uttejit utsarjan"""" bhanchhan kinky paramanuharu ujyalo battile uttejit hunchhan, june prakashko photonko utsarjanko karak ho ra prakash ek prakarko wikiran ho.""  This translates to: ""Scientists call this process """"stimulated emission"""" where atoms become excited when illuminated, which is the source of photon emission and light is a type of radiation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wikiran (radiation)** - While the passage mentions light *is* a type of radiation, it's not the *name* of the specific process described.
*   **B: photonharuko uttejit utsarjan (emission of photons)** - This describes *what happens* in the process, but not the process's name.
*   **C: photon (photon)** - A photon is a particle of light, not the process itself.



"
kun karanley euta parmanuley photon utsarjan garchha?,"The correct answer is **A: atirikta urja mukta garda** (when releasing excess energy).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Afno aghillo urja starma farkan tiniharule prakashbata paeko atirikta urjabata chhutkara paunu parchha."" This translates to ""To get rid of the extra energy they received from the light, they can release it.""  This directly links photon emission to the release of excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: chamkilo prakashko uttejanako karan** (cause of bright light's excitation) - While excitation *leads* to photon emission, it isn't the reason the atom emits them.
* **C: asthir urja ka starharu** (unstable energy levels) - The passage doesn't focus on instability, but rather the need to *get rid of* extra energy.
* **D: wikiranko euta nakaratmak pratikriya** (a negative reaction of radiation) -  The passage describes emission as a normal process, not a negative reaction.



"
"anuchhed anusar, antata ke karanley garda battiko bulb balna chodchha?","The correct answer is **C: bulb bhitrako filament balera** (because the filament inside the bulb breaks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sayaun ghantako sanchalan pachhi akhirma balbako filament balchha ra tyasapachhi light balbale cam gardaina."" This directly translates to ""After several hours of operation, eventually the bulb's filament breaks and then the light does not shine.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: prakash sthirata sahi tarikaley banda nagarera** (because the light switch wasn't turned off correctly) - The passage mentions turning off the switch for *safety* during bulb replacement, not as the *cause* of the bulb failing.
*   **B: bulbko dhatuko pidh amsik rupma matra sakettma bhayera** (because part of the bulb's metal base is still in the socket) - This describes a *danger* of changing the bulb, not why it stops working.
*   **D: socketma bhayeko vidhyutko begh kam bhayera** (because the electric current in the socket is weak) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the current being weak.



"
nimna madhey kun battiko bulb ferda sambhawata khatarnak huna sakcha?,"The correct answer is **A: filament**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the filament breaks after the bulb has been on for a while, leading to the bulb not lighting up. More importantly, it warns that touching the bulb *while still connected to power* (even if the light isn't on) can be dangerous because the filament (or its metal base) might still be partially energized and give you a severe electric shock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: battiko switch (light switch):** The passage advises turning *off* the switch for safety *before* changing the bulb, meaning the switch itself isn’t the hazard.
* **C: bulbko pidh (bulb base):** While the base *can* conduct electricity, the passage specifically highlights the filament as the most immediate danger due to its potential to remain energized after the bulb burns out.
* **D: taar (wire):** The wire is part of the circuit and carries electricity, but the passage’s direct warning focuses on the filament/bulb base.

nimna madhey kunley prithvima lamo duri ko call firta pathauchha,"The correct answer is **B: upagrahaharu (satellites)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tapainle hajaraun mile tadha call garda tapain upagraha prayog gardai hunu hunchha. Antarikshama upagrahale call prapta garchha..."" (When you make a call thousands of miles away, you are using satellites. Satellites in space receive the call...).  This directly links long-distance calls to satellites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: telescope (durbeen):** Telescopes are used for *observing* space, not for transmitting calls.
*   **C: battiharu (lights):** Lights have nothing to do with phone calls.
*   **D: rocket (raket):** Rockets *launch* satellites, but they don't receive or relay calls themselves.



"
nimna madhey kun antarikshama telescopeharu rakhna prayog garincha?,"The correct answer is **A: prakashko kiranharu (rays of light)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that scientists use telescopes in space to overcome distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere when observing light. They are essentially studying *light* from space using telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: rocket:** Rockets are *used to launch* telescopes into space, but aren't what the telescopes *study*.
* **C: prithviko vaayumandal (Earth's atmosphere):**  The passage mentions the atmosphere *distorts* observations, but the telescopes are placed in space to *avoid* the atmosphere, not study it directly.
* **D: 100 feet bhanda aglo upagrahaharu (satellites above 100 feet):** This refers to the height needed to place a telescope, not what they observe.



"
samaya biteko track garnakolagi chakriya ghatanabarey ke tipnu parcha?,"The correct answer is **B: punararitti** (recurrence).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tapainle chakriya ghatanako **punararitti** awalokan garera aafainle samay biteko chinhit garna saknuhunchha.""  This directly translates to ""By observing the **recurrence** of cyclical events, you can mark the passage of time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: awadhi** (duration) - While duration is *related* to time, the text specifically says we track time by observing *how often* something repeats, not how long it lasts.
* **C: asar** (effect) - Effect doesn't help us measure time.
* **D: kathinai** (difficulty) - Difficulty is irrelevant to tracking time using cyclical events.



"
"anuchhed anusar, ghatanako kun paksha tulana garna samaya prayog garincha?","The correct answer is **A: lambai**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hamile ghatanaharuko awadhi (lambai) tulana gurney tarika samay pani ho."" This translates to ""We experience time as a series of events passing from future to present, and comparing the duration (length) of events is also time."" 

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that **length** (lambai) is the aspect of events that we use to perceive and measure time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: punararitti (repetition):** While the passage mentions cyclical events and repetition as *indicators* of time passing, it doesn't say we compare events based on their repetition to *understand* time.
* **C: anubhav (experience):** Experience is *how* we perceive time, not what aspect of events we compare to measure it.
* **D: asar (effect):**  Effect is a consequence of time, not a component used in its measurement.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kelai sinhansanko uttaradhikariko lagi samanya manincha?","The correct answer is **D: senama varti huna aghi vishwavidyalaya janu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the heirs to the throne *go* to university (specifically, Charles did) *before* serving in the military.  It explicitly says ""Paramparagat rupma, sinhasanka uttaradhikariharu skull sidhyaepachi siddha sainya sewama janechhan"" - ""Traditionally, heirs to the throne complete their education and *then* serve in the military.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2:2 degree prapta garnu (Obtaining a 2:2 degree)** - While Charles *did* get a 2:2, the passage doesn't say this is typical or required for heirs.
*   **B: senama bharti huna vishwavidyalaya tyagnu (Joining the military and abandoning university)** - The passage clearly states the opposite – completing education *before* military service.
*   **C: itihas padhnu (Studying history)** - Charles studied history, but the passage doesn’t suggest that all heirs must study history.



"
"anuchhedma diyeko jankariko adharma, charles ke garna pahilo hun?","The correct answer is **A: vidalaya sakauna aghi senama bharti hunu** (joining the military before finishing school).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Paramparagat rupma, sinhasanka uttaradhikariharu skull sidhyaepachi siddha sainya sewama janechhan."" This translates to ""Traditionally, heirs to the throne would join the military after completing their education.""  This implies Charles *first* intended to join the military.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: puratwatwa padhna** (studying archaeology) - He did study archaeology, but that wasn't the *first* thing he did.
* **C: degree prapta garnu** (getting a degree) - He got a degree, but the text focuses on his military intention *before* university.
* **D: trinity college ma padhnu** (studying at Trinity College) -  He studied at Trinity College, but again, that came *after* the traditional military path.



"
trygvassonko samuha kun deshbata thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: norvey**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Yass samuhako netritwa olaf trigwassionle gareka thee, jo ek nervelli thee..."" which translates to ""This group was led by Olaf Trygvasson, who was a Norwegian..."".  Therefore, the group originated from Norway.

While the passage mentions England, Denmark, and doesn't mention Germany, the key information points directly to Norway as the origin of Trygvasson's group.



"
itihasko kun samayama germanyley astoniamathi baliyo sanskritik prabhwv parna thalyo?,"The passage states that during the 15th century (which was roughly 600 years ago), Northern Estonia was under significant cultural influence from Germany. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: lagbhag 600 varsha aghi** (approximately 600 years ago).



"
astoniako bhasha kebata prabhawit bhayeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: germanko warnamala** (German alphabet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yo german warnamalama adharit thiyo ra ek worn “Õ/õ” thapieko thiyo."" (This was based on the German alphabet and included one letter ""Õ/õ""). This directly indicates the Estonian language was influenced by the German alphabet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Õ/õ akchyar** (Õ/õ letter) - While the letter is *part* of the influence, it's not the source of it.
*   **C: german bhikshu** (German monks) - The monks initiated the process, but the *influence* came through the alphabet.
*   **D: bhagwan** (God) -  The monks' motivation regarding God doesn't represent a linguistic influence on the Estonian language itself.



"
"anuchhed anusar, maitribhasha hindi waktaharuko ghatbadh ke karanma adharit hunchha?","The correct answer is **A: yedi hindi sanga samman boliharulai ganna garney ho bhaney** (if you count people who speak Hindi alongside other languages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matribhasha waktaharuko sankhya nikat rupma sambandhit dherai boliharu ganna garinchha key garindaina bhannema nirbhar garchha.""  This translates to: ""The number of native language speakers is closely related to how many speakers are counted, depending on whether many speakers are counted.""  

This means the count of Hindi speakers depends on *how* they are counted – whether you only count those who speak Hindi as their *first* language, or if you include those who speak Hindi *along with* other languages.  The passage then goes on to mention a large range in estimated speakers (340-800 million), illustrating this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yedi urdu waktaharulai ganna garney ho bhaney:** While Hindi and Urdu are similar, the passage doesn't directly link the count to including Urdu speakers.
* **C: yedi bhasha bujhney masniharulai ganna garney ho bhaney:**  The passage mentions understanding the language (800 million can understand), but the count of *speakers* is the focus of the discussion about variation.
* **D: yedi bhasha padhna sakney manisharulai ganana garney ho bhaney:** The passage talks about speaking and understanding, not reading.



"
nimna madhey kun kathan hindi ra urdu bhashabarey satya ho?,"The correct answer is **D: tiniharuko shabdakosh farak chha** (Their vocabularies differ).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lipima bhinna hune hindi ra urdu lekhaima saman chan"" which translates to ""Despite having different scripts, Hindi and Urdu are the same in writing."" This means the *writing systems* are similar, not the scripts themselves.
* **The passage also states:** ""dubai bhashaka waktaharule dainik kurakanima samanyataya ek arkalai bujhna sakchhan"" which translates to ""Speakers of both languages generally understand each other in daily conversations."" This implies a degree of mutual intelligibility despite differences.

Since they understand each other, but have different scripts, it suggests the key difference lies in **vocabulary (shabdakosh)**. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dubai bhashaharuka waktaharu bich praya: visambandha cha** (There is a strong disconnect between speakers of both languages) - The passage suggests the opposite; they understand each other.
* **B: tiniharu lipima chuttai chhan** (Their scripts are different) - The passage states the *writing* is similar despite different *scripts*.
* **C: tiniharu shabdakosh ra lipima saman chhan** (Their vocabularies and scripts are the same) - The passage explicitly states the vocabularies differ and the scripts are different.



"
nimna madhey kun hangul sabdamalabarey sahi tathya hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: sabdamalako maulik nam hunan jeongeum thiyo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Unle maulik rupma hangul warnamalako name hunmin jongam rakhe, jasko earth """"janatako nirdeshanka lagi sahi awaz"""" ho.""  (The original name of the Hangul alphabet was Hunminjeongeum, which means ""The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People."")

* Option B claims the original name was ""hunan jeongeum"" which is incorrect according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: yo raja sejongko shasankalma awishkar bhayeko thiyo** -  The passage clearly states Hangul was invented during Raja Sejong's reign (1444).
* **C: yaslai joseon samrajyako chauthaun rajaley awishkar gariyeko thiyo** - The passage confirms Raja Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and invented Hangul.
* **D: yo udhyashyapurvak awiskar gariyeko thiyo** - The passage implies it was a deliberate and purposeful creation (""shasankalma awishkar bhaeko thiyo"" - invented during his reign).



"
hunmin jeogeum sabdamala akhirma kema pariwartan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **B: hangul**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Unle maulik rupma hangul warnamalako name hunmin jongam rakhe..."" This directly translates to ""Originally, the name of the Hangul alphabet was Hunmin Jongam..."" 

Therefore, Hunmin Jongam eventually became known as Hangul.



"
"annuched anusar, kun bhashaharu sanskritdwara prabhawit bhayeka chhan?","The correct answer is **B: europeli bhashaharu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Francelli ra spanish jasta europeli bhashaharuka srota latin jastai bharatiya bhashaharuka lagi sanskrit dherai jatil ra dhani bhasha srota banna pugyo.""  This directly translates to: ""Just as Latin is a source for European languages like French and Spanish, Sanskrit became a complex and rich source for Indian languages.""

While the passage mentions Sanskrit being comparable to Latin, it specifically highlights its influence on *European languages* through Latin.  Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: latin bhashaharu** - The passage says Sanskrit is *comparable* to Latin, not that Latin was influenced by Sanskrit.
*   **C: pauranik bhashaharu** - The passage doesn't discuss ancient or mythological languages in general.
*   **D: bharatiya bhashaharu** - While Sanskrit is the source of many Indian languages, the passage *contrasts* this with the way Latin is a source for European languages. The focus is on the European language connection.



"
"anuchhed anusar, sanskritko pragyo ke karanley kam bhayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **D: padanukram** (declension/grammar).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**upanishadharuko sangraha pashchat sanskrit padanukramka karan matra fikka bhayo.**"" This translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit became less prominent due to its declension/grammar."" 

The passage directly links the complexity of Sanskrit grammar (padanukram) to its declining use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jatilta (complexity)** - While Sanskrit *is* complex, the passage specifically points to the *grammar* (padanukram) as the reason for its decline, not just general complexity.
*   **B: aryan basai sarai (Aryan migration)** - The passage mentions Aryan migration as background, but doesn't say it *caused* the decline in Sanskrit's usage.
*   **C: latin bhashaharu (Latin languages)** - Latin languages are used as a comparison to show Sanskrit's importance, but they don’t explain why its usage declined.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun loko gurutwakarshanbarey sahi kathan ho?","The correct answer is **A: prithviko gurutwakarshanley loko gurutwakarshan bhanda kam tancha** (Earth's gravity pulls people less than Io's gravity).

Here's why:

The passage states that on Io, someone weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds. This directly demonstrates that gravity on Io is *weaker* than gravity on Earth.  Therefore, people are pulled less by Io's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: loko gurutwakarshanley dherai tancha, tyai karan tapaiko taul kum hunthiyo** (Io's gravity pulls a lot, which is why your weight is less) - This is the opposite of what the passage says. Io's gravity is *less*, causing a *lower* weight.
* **C: loko gurutwakarshanley dherai tancha, tyai karan tapaiko taul dherai hunthiyo** (Io's gravity pulls a lot, which is why your weight is more) - Incorrect for the same reason as B.
* **D: prithviko gurutwakarshanley tapailai loko gurutwakarshanley bhanda badhi tanthiyo** (Earth's gravity pulls you more than Io's gravity) - While true, this isn't the *main* point the passage makes about Io. The passage focuses on how *Io* affects weight.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kathanley chandarmako bahiri sataha lai sahi tarikaley varnan gardachha?","The correct answer is **B: highlandharumuniko crust ajha patalo chha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yo mariamuni patlo ra highlandharu muni baklo hunchha."" (This means maria are thin and highlands are thick.) This directly translates to the crust under the highlands being thicker/not as thin (essentially, 'patalo chha' - not thin).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: chheuko bhagko crust ajha baklo chha (the last part of the crust is still thick)** - The passage doesn't say the *last part* is thick, it says the highlands are thick.
* **C: parako bhaagmaa kam maria huna sakchha (there might be fewer maria in the outer part)** - The passage says maria are thinner, not that there are fewer of them.
* **D: tyaha highlandmuni kam maria huna sakchha (there might be fewer maria under the highlands)** - The passage doesn't relate the *number* of maria to the highlands, but rather the *thickness* of the crust.



"
"anuchhed anusar, chandramako crust sabbhanda dherai kanha baklo chha?","The correct answer is **C: highlandharu muni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Crust najik turf lagbhag 70 kilometer moto ra tadha turf 100 kilometer baklo cha. Yo mariamuni patlo ra highlandharu muni baklo hunchha.""  This directly translates to ""The crust near the surface is about 70 kilometers thick and that thickness is 100 kilometers under the highlands.""

Therefore, the crust is thickest *under the highlands*.



"
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhey kun kura nischit manisharuley vishwash gardachhan?","The correct answer is **C: anya grahaharuma jiwan cha** (there is life on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kehī manisharu tyahanbata key niskinchha bhanera achamma manchan ra kehile alien wa any jeevan arko sanyantrama banchna sakne vishwas gardachan."" This translates to: ""...some people wonder what is certain from there and some believe that aliens or life can exist on another planet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: manavharuley arko tarama yatra garisakye** (humans can travel to another star) - The passage says people *dream* of this, but doesn't state it as a certainty.
*   **B: manavharu anya sansar anweshan garna yogya chhainan** (humans are not capable of exploring other worlds) - The passage doesn't mention this; it suggests exploration is a potential future goal.
*   **D: taraharu bich trillion mileharu bhanda kam duri chha** (the distance between stars is less than trillions of miles) - The passage explicitly states the distances are *vast* (""kharbaun mileko duree cha""), meaning it's likely *more* than trillions of miles.



"
suryako kendrabata jhan tadha jada ke patalo hudai janchha?,"The correct answer is **C: gas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tapain surya kendrabata tadha jaanda gas patlo hundai janchha."" which translates to ""You will find gas falling into the center of the sun.""

While the sun *is* made of gas, plasma, and fire, the passage specifically mentions **gas** falling towards the center.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hamile suryalai herda dekhine bahiri bhaglai photosphere bhaninchha, jasko earth """"prakashko ball ho."""""", which translates to ""The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which the earth calls """"ball of light."""""".

Therefore, the photosphere is the part of the sun visible from Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: crust** - The crust is a part of a planet, not the sun.
*   **B: plasma** - While the sun *is* made of plasma, it's not the part we directly see.
*   **D: kendra** - The center (kendra) of the sun is not visible from Earth."
nimna madhey kun awalokanle conpernicus siddhanta bayan garna maddat garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: shukrako charanharu** (Venus's phases).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that observing Venus going through phases (like the moon) *supported* Copernicus's theory that planets revolve around the sun.  If Venus orbited the Earth, it wouldn't show phases like that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shukrako marga** (Venus's path) - The path itself doesn't directly prove the heliocentric model, it's *how* it appears that's important (the phases).
* **C: suryako shukrasangako samanta** (The sun's alignment with Venus) - Alignment alone doesn't provide proof of orbit.
* **D: suryako chandramasangako samanta** (The sun's alignment with the moon) - This is irrelevant to proving the heliocentric model.



"
nimna madhey kun kura galileo galilei ley 1610 ma awalokan gareka thiye?,"The correct answer is **B: shukrako charanharu** (Venus's phases).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lagbhag teen hazaar warshapachhi, sun 1610 maa, italian khagolvid galileo gallelyle telescope prayog garera shukraka pani chandramaka jastai charanharu hunchhan bhane awalokan gare."" This translates to: ""Around three thousand years ago, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus also has phases like the moon.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: suryalai herney chandramako bhag** (the part of the moon facing the sun) - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: surya oripari ghumiraheka grahaharu** (planets revolving around the sun) - While Galileo's observation *supported* this theory, he didn't directly observe planets revolving around the sun in 1610. He observed the phases of Venus which then provided evidence *for* the heliocentric model.
*   **D: shukrako marga** (Venus's path) - The text does not mention observing Venus's path.



"
"anuchhed anusar, amazon nadiley kahabata pani sankalan gardacha?","The correct answer is **A: sana nadiharu** (small rivers).

The passage states: ""yasale hajaraun sanah nadiharubata pani sankalan gardacha."" which translates to ""it collects water from thousands of small rivers.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sabaibhanda lamo nadi** (the longest river) - While Amazon *is* the longest, the passage says it collects water *from* rivers, not that it *is* rivers.
*   **C: samudraharu** (oceans) - The passage mentions water flowing *to* the ocean, but not collecting from it.
*   **D: doshro thulo nadi** (the second largest river) - Amazon is the largest, not the second largest.



"
kun viseshta amazon nadisanga sambhantit chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: yo sabaibhanda lamo nadi ho** (It is the longest river).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Prithviko dosro sabaibhanda lamo ra thulo nadi amazon ho"" (Amazon is the second longest and biggest river in the world). 
* Therefore, it is *not* the longest river, but the *second* longest.  The passage specifically states it's second.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: yo doshro sabaibhanda lamo nadi ho** -  This is directly stated in the passage.
* **B: yo sabaibhanda thulo nadi ho** - This is also directly stated.
* **D: yo sabaibhanda farakilo nadi pani ho** - The passage says ""Amazon prithviko sabaibhanda farakilo nadi pani ho"" (Amazon is the widest river in the world).



"
anuchhedma ullekhit kun camley sabaibhanda thorai bhenejuelaka manisharulai rozgar dincha?,"The correct answer is **C: tell**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bhenejuelawasiharuko mahatwapurna udyog tell ho."" (The most important industry for Venezuelans is oil.) and ""tell udyogma kewal ek pratishatle cam garchhan."" (Only one percent work in the oil industry.)

This indicates that despite being the *most important* industry for Venezuelans, the oil industry employs the *smallest* percentage of the Venezuelan population. Therefore, it provides employment to the fewest Venezuelans compared to the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: krishi (agriculture):** The passage says ""panchaun bhag krishima cam gurney"" (five parts work in agriculture), indicating a significant portion.
*   **B: udhyog (industry):** The passage states ""lagbhag ek chauthai udyogma cam garchhan"" (about a quarter work in industry), which is more than one percent.
*   **D: sewa (services):** The passage states ""sewa kshetrama, lagbhag ek chauthai udyogma ra panchaun bhag krishima cam gurney dui tihai bhenejuela niwasiharu"" (in the service sector, about a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture, employing two thirds of Venezuelans), indicating a large employment share.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kshetraley sabaibhanda dherai bhenejuelaka manisharulai rozgar dinchha?","The correct answer is **B: krishi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...panchaun bhag krishima cam gurney dui tihai bhenejuela niwasiharu.""  This translates to ""Five parts agriculture employ two-thirds of the Venezuelan population.""

While ""sewa"" (service sector) employs a significant portion, it's stated as ""lagbhag ek chauthai"" (about a quarter), which is less than the five parts/two-thirds employed by agriculture. The others (industry and oil) employ even smaller portions."
"anuchhed anusar, fusionley taraharulai ke garna dincha?","The correct answer is **C: prakash ra tap dina** (to give light and heat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hydrogen paramanuharu ek apasma vilaya (wa fuse) bhaera bhari tatwaharu banaunda baneko urjaka karan taraharule **prakash ra tap dinchhan**."" (Hydrogen atoms fuse to create heavier elements, and the energy released from this causes stars to give **light and heat**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thap bhari tatwa banauna** (to create heavier elements) - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the passage says the *energy* from that process gives off light and heat.
*   **B: fusion reactorharu nirman garna** (to build fusion reactors) - The passage mentions scientists *trying* to build reactors, but doesn't say fusion itself builds them.
*   **D: hydrogen parmanuharu srijana garna** (to create hydrogen atoms) - Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



"
nimna madhey euta upayogi fusion reactorley ke srijana gardacha?,"The correct answer is **D: urja (energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hydrogen atoms fuse to create heavier elements, *releasing energy* in the form of light and heat. Scientists are trying to build a reactor that can *generate energy* using the same process. Therefore, a useful fusion reactor would create energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hydrogen:** A reactor *uses* hydrogen, it doesn't *create* it.
*   **B: taraharu (elements):** While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the main goal of a reactor is to harness the energy released, not necessarily to produce those elements.
*   **C: parmanuharu (atoms):** Atoms are involved in the process, but the reactor's output isn't atoms themselves – it's the energy from their fusion.



"
paniko rasayanik banawat ke ho?,"The correct answer is **D: duita hydrogen parmanuharu ra euta oxygen parmau** (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

The passage explicitly states: ""yaugik pani dui hydrogen ra ek oxygen paramanu miller baneko cha"" which translates to ""a compound is made of two hydrogen and one oxygen atom.""



"
paniley afno murtarup parivartan garepachhi ke saman rahancha?,"The correct answer is **A: anawik rachana (molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even when a substance changes physical states (gas, liquid, solid), its *anawik sanrachana* (molecular structure) remains the same. The example of water (H₂O) illustrates this – whether it's gas, liquid, or solid ice, it's still two hydrogen and one oxygen atom bonded together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ghanatwa (density):** Density *changes* with physical state (gas is less dense than liquid, which is less dense than solid).
* **C: bhautik awastha (physical state):** This is *what changes*, not what remains the same.
* **D: taral nitrogen (liquid nitrogen):** This is an example used in the passage, not the general principle.



"
madhey vishesh kanunharu lagu garna prayash garda terha rajyaharukolagi nimna madhye kun vishay ko samasya thiyena?,"The correct answer is **C: sarvasammat swikriti awashyak parney samsodhanharu** (the need for unanimous consent for amendments).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *any* amendment to the articles required unanimous consent from all thirteen states. This created a significant problem because states could easily block changes even if they benefited the majority. The passage also mentions states felt under-represented when their delegates were absent, furthering the difficulty of achieving consensus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: rajya adhikariharubata vyapak nirikshan** (extensive oversight from state officials): While the central government *relied* on state officials, the passage doesn't frame this as a *problem* with implementing laws. It’s presented as a consequence of the weak central authority.
*   **B: congress bhitra shaktiko kami** (lack of power within Congress): The passage notes Congress was a component of the confederation, but doesn't explicitly state its internal power was the issue. The problem was more about its power relative to the states.
*   **D: astitwama nabhayeko rashtriya karyakari** (non-existent national executive): This is true, but the passage presents the lack of a national executive and judiciary as a contributing factor to the overall weakness, not the primary issue hindering law implementation. The core problem was the difficulty of changing the rules to *create* those institutions.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kun kathanley krantikari yuddhako samayma kendriya sarkarko awastha sahi tarikaley jhalkaucha?","The correct answer is **C: rajyako pratinidhiharuko upasthitiko kami thiyo** (There was a lack of representation of state representatives).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""rajyaharule kendra sarkarlai yati halka rupma lie key uniharuka pratinidhiharu prayaha anupasthit hunthe."" This directly translates to ""states considered the central government weak because their representatives were often absent.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: karharu congress ra rajya aadhikariharudwara lagu gariyo** (taxes were imposed by Congress and state officials) - While the passage mentions taxes being levied, it doesn't define the *state* of the central government based on this.
* **B: dharaharuko samsodhanharu congressko adhikarima nirbhar thiye** (amendments to the articles depended on Congress's authority) - The passage states amendments required unanimous consent from *all* states, not just Congress's authority.
* **D: kendriya sarkar duita mukhya bhagharubata baneko thiyo** (the central government was formed by two main parts) - The passage doesn't focus on the composition of the central government, but rather its *weakness*.



"
swatantratako mull ghoshanako pachadi shabdaharu kasari lekhiyeka chan?,"The correct answer is **A: thulo akchhyarma** (large letters).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swatantratako ghoshana pachadi """"swatantratako mull ghoshana 4 july 1776"""" lekhieko thiyo.""  This directly translates to ""The Declaration of Independence was written """"Declaration of Independence 4 July 1776""""."" While not explicitly stating *how* it was written, the context implies it was written in large, formal letters, as is typical for important declarations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: code maa (in code):** The text mentions a possible cipher (""sanket nalai lebelko rupma thapne sambhawana raheko cha"") but doesn't say the Declaration itself *is* in code.
* **C: tala mathi (on top):**  This is irrelevant to how the words were written.
* **D: sano akchhyarma (small letters):** Important declarations are rarely written in small letters.

Therefore, **A: thulo akchhyarma** is the most logical answer based on the information provided.



"
singapur nimna madhey kekolagi prasiddha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: sahari hariyali (urban greenery)**.

Here's why:

* **P** describes Singapore's transformation into a ""tropical garden city"" and mentions the Botanic Gardens. This highlights a focus on greenery within the city.
* **Q** asks what Singapore is famous for.
* The passage directly supports that Singapore is known for its deliberate and successful integration of nature into its urban environment – its ""sahari hariyali.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: hiking:** While Singapore has some hiking trails, it's not its primary claim to fame.
* **C: sahasik khel (adventure sports):** Singapore offers some adventure sports, but again, it’s not what it’s widely known for.
* **D: pradarshan kalaharu (performing arts):** Singapore has a growing arts scene, but it’s not the first thing people typically associate with the country.



"
vanda miss joakim ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: euta ful** (a flower).

The text states: ""1981 maa, archid hybrid, vanda miss joakwimlai rashtrako rashtriya fulko rupma chhanieko thiyo."" This translates to: ""In 1981, the orchid hybrid, Vanda Miss Joaquim, was chosen as the national flower of the country.""

Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower.
"
"anuchhed anusar, gija piramidharuko kun viseshta lai naya rajya egyptianharuley prasamsha nagarney sambhawana thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: tiniharuko aakar (their size)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the pyramids were admired because of their size (""akar"") and construction technique (""nirmanko praidhik utkrishtata""). It also says newer states (naya rajya) were impressed by these older monuments.  The question asks what the new Egyptians *might* have admired. While they would have likely appreciated the construction, the passage explicitly highlights the *size* as a key factor in their admiration.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: tiniharuko umer (their age):** The passage doesn't focus on the age of the pyramids as something to be admired.
*   **B: dhungako prayog (use of stone):** While using stone was important, the passage emphasizes *how* it was done (construction technique) alongside the size.
*   **D: tiniharuko nirman (their construction):** The passage mentions construction as impressive, but size is more directly highlighted as the reason for awe.



"
"anuchhed anusar, sakahariharu paniko khoji gardai kaha yatra gardachan?","The correct answer is **C: dakshini maidanharutarf**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pratyek warsha october waripari karib 1.5 million sakahari jiva warshaka lagi uttari pahadbata **mara nadi paar gardai dakshini maidanharutarf yatra garchhan**.""  This translates to: ""Every year in October, approximately 1.5 million herbivores travel from the northern highlands, **crossing the Mara River to the southern plains**.""

Therefore, the herbivores travel to the southern plains in search of water.



"
"anuchhed anusar, aprilko cheuchau sahakariharu kun kshetrabata prasthan gardachan?","The correct answer is **C: mara nadi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...lagbhag aprilko warsha pachhi ekpatak ferry **mara nadi** paar gardai tyasapachhi paschim hundai uttarma farkinchhan."" 

This translates to: ""...after the April rains, they cross the **Mara River** by ferry for about a week, then head west and north.""

Therefore, the animals *begin* their journey after April by crossing the Mara River.  The other options are destinations or areas they travel *through*, not where they start from in April.



"
sealion operation kun deshko akraman thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: belayat** (United Kingdom/Britain).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Franceko ladain sakiepachhi germanyle belayatko tapuma akraman gurney tayari suru garyo."" This translates to: ""After the France war, Germany began preparing for an attack on Britain.""  

""Operation Sealion"" (operation silian) was the code name for Germany's planned invasion of Britain.



"
belayatmathiko hamlalai germanyharuley ke nam diye?,"The correct answer is **B: operation silian**.

The text explicitly states: ""Germanyle ukta hamalalai """"""""operation silian"""""""" co sanket -name deo."" which translates to ""Germany gave the said attack the code name """"""""operation silian"""""""""". 

Therefore, the attack on Britain was named ""Operation Silian"" by Germany.
"
kelai italyko african deshharu kabja garney yojanakolagi mahatwpurna charan vanera ullekhit chaina?,"The correct answer is **C: fauj prakshepan padko sthapana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""tee deshharu kabza garna, faujaharulai bhumadhya sagar paar garera africama akraman gurney banauna uniharusanga euta fauj prakshepan pads hunuparne thiyo.""  This translates to: ""To capture these countries, they needed to establish a military launchpad to send troops across the Mediterranean to attack Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: egyptma vayeka jahajharu hataunu (removing ships stationed in Egypt):** While getting rid of British bases and ships *was* a goal, the passage frames it as a *necessary step* to achieve the launchpad, not the main step itself.
*   **B: thap jahajharuko nirman garnu (building four ships):** Building the ships was a preparation, but not the core of the plan to conquer Africa.
*   **D: belayati adharharu dhwasta banaunu (destroying British bases):** Similar to A, this was a means to an end (the launchpad), not the main action itself.



"
"anuchhed anuaar, italyko yuddhako prathamik lakshya ke maninthiyo?","The correct answer is **A: African deshharu kabza garnu** (To conquer African countries).

The passage explicitly states: ""Italyka mukhya lakshyaharu african deshharu thee."" (Italy's main objectives were African countries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ajha baliyo sena ra nausenako nirman** (To build a stronger army and navy) - While Italy *was* building ships, it wasn't their primary goal, but a means to an end.
* **C: egyptian jahajharu hataunu** (To destroy Egyptian ships) - The passage mentions needing to free themselves from British bases and ships, not specifically destroy Egyptian ones.
* **D: belayati adharharuko sthapana** (To establish British bases) - The passage says they needed to *get rid of* British bases, not establish them.



"
aakramakharusanga kasley maitripurna sambandhaharu sthapana garye?,"The correct answer is **B: bhichi french**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yea francelli manisharu thee jasle 1940 maa germanharusanga shanti samjhauta gareka thee ra akramankariharusanga ladai garnuko satta miller cam gare.""  This directly translates to ""These French people made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and instead of fighting the invaders, they turned a blind eye.""  This refers to the ""bhichi"" (Vichy) French government, who collaborated with the Germans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: germanharu** - The Germans were the ones *being* agreed with, not establishing the relationship.
* **C: americi** - The Americans fought *against* the Germans and Vichy French.
* **D: swatantra franceli** - The Free French fought *against* the Germans and Vichy French.



"
operation dragonma samlagna mitra rashtraharu koko thiye?,"The correct answer is **A: americi ra swatantra franceli** (Americans and Free French).

The text specifically states: ""Kewal dui haptama americi ra swatantra francelli senaharule dakshini francelai swatantra garaiskeka thee"" which translates to ""Only in two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France.""

Therefore, the answer is clearly Americans and the Free French forces.



"
kun prawidhiko vikashley Panadubbiharu panimuni yatra garna suru garye?,"The correct answer is **D: radar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yuddhako suruwatma tiniharu pry: samudrako tuppoma yatra garthe, **tar raderko vikas hoon suru bhaepachi ra ajha yathartha hoon thalepachhi panadubbiharulai nadekhine banaunaka lagi pani muni jaan badhya banaieka thee.**"" 

This translates to: ""Initially they used to undertake voyages like the surface of the sea, but **as radar development began and became more realistic, they were forced to build submarines that couldn't be seen even while underwater.**""

This clearly indicates that the development of radar forced the evolution of submarines to operate underwater to avoid detection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yu-boats:** Yu-boats were German submarines, not a technology that *enabled* underwater travel.
*   **B: shooting dayara:** This refers to limited shooting days and isn’t related to the *reason* submarines started traveling underwater.
*   **C: parichalan:** This refers to operation/navigation, which submarines always needed, but doesn't explain *why* they went underwater.



"
"pahilo prayogko awadhima, Panadubbiharuko kun kshetrama dherai simit thiye?","The correct answer is **C: shooting**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pachadi tiniharu dherai dhilo bhae ra **simit shooting dayarama rahe**."" (Later, they became very expensive and had limited shooting days.)

This directly indicates that the area where submarines were limited was in the realm of shooting/filming, likely referring to the production of movies or documentaries about them. The passage talks about designing a journey/voyage for submarines and then needing to build them, indicating that the *actual* voyages weren't limited, but the *representation* of them (through filming) was.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kasley samjhauta ullanghan garyo? ","The correct answer is **D: sovietharu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...jab riga shanti sandhi, sobhiyat-police gair-akraman sandhiharu ra any antarrashtriya sandhiharu dwipakhiya bahupakhiya rupma ullanghan garera polandka purvi kshetraharuma akraman garepachhi sobhiyat union red armika...""  This translates to ""...when the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pacts and other international treaties were violated in a bilateral or multilateral manner with the invasion of Poland's eastern territories, the Soviet Union's Red Army..."" 

Therefore, it is the **Soviet Union** (sovietharu) who violated the agreements.



"
nimna madhey red sainik le ke garenan?,"The correct answer is **A: ukreni morchako srijana (the creation of the Ukrainian front)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...sobhiyat union red armika 800,000bhanda bhanda badhi sainikharule praesh gare ra **belarusi ra yukreni morchaharu sirjana gare**."" ( ...the Soviet Union's Red Army entered with more than 800,000 soldiers and **created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: purwi kshetra ko akraman (attack on the eastern territories)** - While the passage mentions an attack on Poland's eastern territories, it states this was done *before* the Red Army entered, not *by* the Red Army.
*   **C: pulko shir bhag ko punargathan (reorganization of the Polish head)** - The passage doesn't mention any reorganization of Poland's leadership. It mentions rebuilding fortifications, but not related to leadership.
*   **D: sandhiko ullanghan (violation of treaties)** - The passage mentions treaty violations but states it was done *before* the Red Army entered. The Red Army's action was a *result* of those violations, not the violation itself.



"
italyko dashaun senako engineer-in-Chieflai ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **C: unlai belayatiley samatey** (He was captured by the British).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bardiyako purvi bhagma bhaeko akramanma, belayati senale italian dasaun senaka engineer-inn-chief, general lastuchilai pakrau garen."" This directly translates to ""In the eastern part of Bardia's attack, the British army captured the Italian tenth army's engineer-in-chief, General Lastucci.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: unlai fort capuzo samatiyo** (He surrendered at Fort Capuzzo) - The passage says the British *took* Fort Capuzzo, not that Lastucci surrendered there.
*   **B: uni tobrukma mariye** (He died in Tobruk) -  Marcel Italo Balbo died in Tobruk, not Lastucci.
*   **D: uni maitripurna hamlama mariye** (He died in a friendly attack) - This is incorrect and not mentioned in the passage.



"
italo balbo kaha mariye?,"The correct answer is **D: tobrook**.

The text states: ""June 28 maa, tobrookma awataran gurney kramama liviaka governor general ra muslinika spashta uttaradhikari marcel italo balbo maitri golibarima mariye."" This directly translates to ""On June 28, during the Gurney landing in Tobruk, the Libyan Governor General and prominent Muslim successor Marcel Italo Balbo died in friendly fire.""

Therefore, Italo Balbo died in Tobruk.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun tarika tibatti dhyanko mahatwapurna bhag ho?","The correct answer is **C: deutaharu chitran garnu** (visualizing deities).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tibeti dhyanko kendra devta yog ho. vibhinna dewataharuko drishyatako madhyambata urja channelharu safa garinchhan..."" This translates to ""The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sass ferne wyayam abhyas garnu** (practicing breathing exercises) - While *sass wyayam* (breathing exercises) is mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, it's not specifically stated as the core of Tibetan meditation.
*   **B: mantraharu dohoraunu** (repeating mantras) - Mantras are mentioned in relation to Kundalini Yoga, not directly as the central aspect of Tibetan meditation.
*   **D: yoga mudraharu pura siknu** (fully learning yoga mudras) - Yoga *mudras* are not explicitly mentioned in the context of Tibetan meditation in the passage.

Therefore, visualizing deities is the key component of Tibetan meditation as described in the provided text."
"anuchhed anusar, tibatti dhyanko “kendra” ma chakraharu kasari sakriya garincha?","The correct answer is **B: dewataharu ko chitran garera** (by visualizing deities).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tibeti dhyanko kendra devta yog ho. vibhinna dewataharuko drishyatako madhyambata urja channelharu safa garinchhan, chakraharu sakriya hunchhan ra atmagyan chetna sirjana hunchha.""

This translates to: ""The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and self-awareness consciousness is created.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vibhinna yoga asanmarfat** (through various yoga poses) - While Kundalini yoga *is* mentioned, it's not stated that visualization of deities activates chakras through yoga poses.
*   **C: mantraharu dohorayera** (by repeating mantras) - Mantras are mentioned as part of Kundalini yoga, but not specifically linked to the activation of chakras *through* Tibetan meditation.
*   **D: sass ferne wyayam abhyas garnu** (practicing breath exercises) - Breath exercises are part of Kundalini yoga, again not directly related to Tibetan meditation's core practice of deity visualization.



"
karyakramko bela dosro bhakti git kasley prastut garyo?,"The correct answer is **D: jai shankar choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gayak sanju sharmale sanjha suru gare, tyasapachhi **jaya shankar chaudharile chhapanna bhog bhajan pani prastut gare**."" (Singer Sanju Sharma started the evening, after that **Jaya Shankar Chaudhary also presented the Chhappan Bhog Bhajan**.)

Therefore, Jaya Shankar Chaudhary presented the second devotional song (Chhappan Bhog Bhajan).



"
"anuchhed anusar, khaneykura paskiraheko bela bhakti git kasley prastut garyo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakha sinha ley chhappan bhog bhajan pani prastut gare."" (Lakha Singh also presented the Chhappan Bhog Bhajan).  Chhappan Bhog directly relates to the offering of 56 different food items. Therefore, Lakkha Singh presented the devotional song *while* the food offering was happening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** Presented a ""chhappan bhog bhajan"" *before* the actual offering.
* **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity receiving the offering, not the performer.
* **D: Sanju Sharma:** Started the program, but didn't sing during the food offering.

The passage states: ""Turkey diva sezen aksu ley italian tenor tennis Alessandro safina ra greek gayak Haris Alexiou sanga pradarshan gare."" This directly translates to ""Turkey diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor tennis Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.""  This happened *before* the final performance by the ""Fire of Anatolia"" group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: antoliako ago (Fire of Anatolia):** This was the *final* presentation, not the second to last.
* **C: whirling darbhisharu (whirling dervishes):**  This performance happened earlier in the show.
* **D: fatih ercos ra musalam gorcesle (Fatih Ercoş and Musalam Gorces):** This was also an earlier performance with the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra.



"
alessandro safinako rashtriyata ke ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Italian**.

The text states: ""Turkey diva Sezen Aksu ley italian tenor tennis Alessandro Safina..."" which directly identifies Alessandro Safina as Italian.
"
"annuchedko adharma, nimna madhey kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **D: sawaribata pahilo wyaktilai nikalna 60 minet lagyo.**

Here's why:

The passage states it could take **one hour** (ek ghanta) to get the first person off the roller coaster.  60 minutes is equal to one hour, so this statement *is* true according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: santa clarama ago lageko thiyo** - The passage states ""santa clarama 90 ko dashak tapakram dina tato bhaeko thiyo"" which translates to ""Santa Clarita had 90 degree days in a row"". High temperatures can lead to fires, so it's reasonable to infer a fire occurred.
*   **B: manisharu roller coasterma adkeka thiye** - The passage states ""kamtima bhannuparda kunai roller coasterma faseko lambai asahaj hunthyo"" which translates to ""at least someone was stuck on a roller coaster"".
*   **C: yatruharulai pani diyeko thiyo** - The passage starts with ""Yatruharu 90 (fahrenheit) degreeko garmima pratiksha garirahanda uniharulai pani diieko thiyo"" which means ""Passengers were given water while waiting in 90-degree heat"".



Therefore, option D is the only statement that accurately reflects the information provided in the passage."
"anuchhed anusar, asahaj tapakrambarey kasley tippani garyo?","The correct answer is **B: fire kaptan**.

The passage states: ""fire kaptan scott counsele bhane. """"""""kamtima bhannuparda kunai roller coasterma faseko lambai asahaj hunthyo ra pahilo wyaktilai sawaribata bahira nikalna ek ghanta lynn sakthyo."""""" This directly translates to ""fire captain Scott Counsel said, 'At least to say, being stuck on a roller coaster would be very difficult and it could take an hour to get the first person off the ride.'""

Therefore, the fire captain is the one who commented on the difficult situation.



"
sunami gatiwidhiko karan kaha bijuli gayeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: tonga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bijuli asthayi rupma band bhayo, jasle kathit rupma tonganka adhikariharulai PTWC ley zari gareko sunami chetawani prapta garnabata rokyo."" This translates to ""...electricity was temporarily cut off, which reportedly prevented officials in Tonga from receiving the tsunami warning issued by PTWC."" 

Therefore, the power outage (and thus the reason for not receiving the tsunami warning) occurred in Tonga.



"
"anuchhed anusar, tongalai bijuli gayekoley kasari asar garyo?","The correct answer is **D: adhikariharuley sambandhit chetawaniharu prapta garna ashyakshyam bhaye**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the power outage ""prevented Tongan officials from receiving the tsunami warnings issued by PTWC."" This means the power outage directly hindered their ability to get the warnings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tyaha kehi kshati bhayo bhanera report gariyo** - The passage says there were *no* reports of major damage.
*   **B: adhikariharuley chetawaniharu hatayekobarey kehi khabar prapta garenan** - The passage says the outage prevented them from *receiving* warnings, not that they removed them.
*   **C: samundra sataha ko mapan prabhawit bhayo** - The passage states the tsunami was *detected* by the sea level measuring instruments, not affected by the outage.



"
prahariley kahiley johnny reidko driving gati janch garna radar bandukharu prayog garna sakshyam bhaye?,"The correct answer is **A: jaba uni 160 kilometer prati ghanta gadi hakiraheko thiye** (when he was driving at 160 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

The text states the police used their speed radar gun *while* observing Jonny Reid driving at 160 km/h to compare his speed to the Black Beauty car. This is the specific moment they would have used the radar gun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pulmathi unko saataun prayasma (his seventh attempt on the bridge)** - The text doesn't say the police used the radar gun on his seventh attempt, just during the 160km/h drive.
* **C: jaba uni 160 kilometer prati ghanta bhanda badi gadi hakiraheka thiye (when he was driving faster than 160 kilometers per hour)** - The text doesn't mention the police measuring his speed *above* 160 km/h. They were focusing on the 160 km/h mark.
* **D: pulmathi unko pahilo prayasma (his first attempt on the bridge)** - Similar to B, the text doesn’t relate the radar gun use to a first attempt.



"
"anuchhed anusar, new zelandko prahariharulai jonny reidko gati janchna kina gahro bhayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: unley 160 kilometer pratighanta bhanda kam gati ma gadi hakiraheko thiyo** (He was driving at a speed less than 160 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

The passage states the police were trying to compare Jonny Reid's speed to the Black Beauty car, which was capable of 160 km/h. However, when the police checked their speed radar, they found *their own* speed had dropped to 160 km/h. This implies Jonny Reid was driving *slower* than 160 km/h, making it difficult for the police to accurately measure his speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: car ekdumai muni thiyo** (The car was completely silent) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the car being silent.
*   **C: unley pulmathi matra saat patak gadi haake** (He only drove seven laps on the bridge) - The number of laps isn't relevant to the difficulty of measuring his speed.
*   **D: auckland harbour pul dherai purano chha** (Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old) - The bridge's age isn't the reason it was hard to measure the speed.



"
butteko tulanama bhukampa ko kendra kaha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 miles dakshin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bhukampako kendravindu dylanko karib 20 kimi (15 mile) utter-uttarpurva ra byutko karib 65 kimi (40 mile) dakshinma thiyo.""  This translates to ""The epicenter of the earthquake was approximately 20 km (15 miles) north-northeast of Dillon and about 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.""

Therefore, relative to Butte, the earthquake's epicenter was 40 miles south."
abu ghribeko dangama ke bhayo?,"सही उत्तर **A: काidi durwyawahar** हो।

प्रश्न सोध्छ कि अबु घ्रिबको दंगामा के भयो? र उत्तर दिइएको छ कि त्यहाँ कैदीहरूमाथि दुर्व्यवहार गरियो, जसले दंगाको कारण बन्यो। अन्य विकल्पहरू सही छैनन् किनकि ती दंगाको कारण होइनन्।

*   **B: lockdown** - लकडाउन दंगाको परिणाम हुन सक्छ, तर यो कारण होइन।
*   **C: अमेरिकी सेनाले नियन्त्रण लियो** - सेनाले नियन्त्रण लिएर दंगा समाप्त भयो, तर यो दंगाको कारण होइन।
*   **D: करगलाई आगो लगाइयो** - यो पनि दंगाको परिणाम हुन सक्छ, तर कारण होइन।"
iraqi karagar kina badanam bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **D: kaidi durwyawahar patta lagepachhi** (after prisoner abuse was revealed).

Here's why:

* **The prompt specifically states that the jail became infamous *after* instances of prisoner abuse were discovered following the American military's occupation.** This makes option D the most direct and accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: teslai ago lagaeako thiyo** (it was set on fire) - While there may have been fires, that wasn't the reason for the infamy.
* **B: americi senaley niyantran liyo** (the American military took control) - Taking control didn't make it infamous; the *actions* that followed did.
* **C: tyaha thuprai dangaharu bhayo** (there were uprisings there) - Uprisings might have happened, but the primary reason for the prison's bad reputation was the documented abuse of prisoners.



"
mauiko war memorial stadiumma kasto prakarko karyakram huney wala thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: jalsa**.

Here's why:

The text states the event was cancelled despite 9,000 people being expected to attend and apologies were made to fans. This suggests a large public entertainment event, which aligns with ""jalsa"" (a rally or large gathering/celebration). The other options don't fit the context as well:

*   **A: jadu pradarshan (magic show)** - Doesn't typically attract 9,000 attendees.
*   **B: football khel (football game)** - While popular, the text doesn't mention sport.
*   **D: paisa uthauney karyakram (fundraising event)** - Fundraising events are less likely to have such large expected attendance.



"
karyakramko kharijibarey akhirkar kasley spashtikarn diyo?,"Correct answer: **B: prabandhak company**

Here's why:

The text states that the band's management company, HK Prabandhak Nigam, initially cancelled the program without giving a reason, and *then* explained the logical reason the next day. This means the management company provided the clarification."
bishkekka basindaharule lutpatko jimmewar ko thiyebhanera soche?,"The correct answer is **C: pradarshankariharu**.

The text states: ""Bishkeka kayaun basindaharule dakshinbata aeka pradarshankariharule kanuna palana nagareko dosh diye.""  This directly translates to ""Bishkek residents blamed the demonstrators coming from the south for not following the law.""

Therefore, Bishkek residents believe the demonstrators are responsible for the looting.



"
lutpatkolagi dakshinko pradarshankariharuko kasley ninda garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: bishkekka basindaharu** (residents of Bishkek).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bishkeka kayaun basindaharule dakshinbata aeka pradarshankariharule kanuna palana nagareko dosh diye."" This directly translates to ""Residents of Bishkek blamed the demonstrators coming from the south for violating the law.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek condemned the southern demonstrators for their actions.



"
ringley kahiley bikri badheko anubhav garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: sark tankma dekha parye pachi** (after appearing on Shark Tank).

The text specifically states: ""Siminofle bhannubhayo key sun 2013 maa sark tank episodema uhaanko upasthitipachhi bikri badheko cha..."" which translates to ""It was said that sales increased after his appearance on the Shark Tank episode in 2013...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2013 ma wittiya surakshit garye pachi** - The text says funding *wasn't* received from Shark Tank.
* **C: qvcma dekha parye pachi** - While he was on QVC in 2017, the text says sales increased *after* Shark Tank, not QVC.
* **D: adt sanga mudda milaye pachi** - The issue with ADT came later and isn't linked to a sales increase.



"
jamie siminoffley kahiey ring suruwat garney nirnay gare?,"The correct answer is **A: unkoo afnai dhoka ghanti aparyapta chha bhanne mahasus gare pachhi** (after realizing his own alarm system was inadequate).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yasaghi, ringka ceo, Jammy Siminafle afno pasalko dhoka ghanti shraanyogya nabhaeko beladekhi company suru gareko tippani garnubhayo."" This directly translates to ""Jamie Siminoff started the company after realizing his home alarm system was not reliable.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sark tankma upasthiti asafal bhaye pachhi** (after his appearance on Shark Tank was unsuccessful) - While he *was* rejected on Shark Tank, the passage says he started the company *before* this, based on his own need.
* **C: wittiya surakshit garye pachi** (after becoming financially secure) - The passage doesn't mention financial security as a motivator for starting the company.
* **D: qvcma safal upasthiti pachhi** (after a successful appearance on QVC) - His QVC appearance happened *after* he started the company in 2017.



"
harek reading rainbow episodeley bacchaharulai keko lagi sifaris garthe?,"The correct answer is **D: kitabharu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Balbalikaharu pustakalayama jaanda tiniharule hernu parne kitabka lagi pratyek karyakramle pustakharuka lagi sifaris pani pradan garchha."" This translates to: ""Each program also provides recommendations for books for children to see when they go to the library.""

Therefore, each Reading Rainbow episode recommends **books** to children.



"
reading rainbow shrinkhalako kharijima ke ko haat huna sakcha?,"The correct answer is **C: john grantko vichaar**.

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes John Grant (of Zone Grant/WNED) saying that ""reading rainbow taught children *what* to read and fostered a love of reading."" This implies his belief (his *vichaar*) is strongly tied to the show's success and why some people believe it helped end a series of educational problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: apug lagani** - The passage doesn’t mention Apug Lagani.
*   **B: emi puraskarko kami** - While the passage states the show won many awards, it doesn't say this is *why* it was successful. Awards are a *result* of success, not the cause.
*   **D: mister roger’s neighborhoodko safalta** - The passage mentions *Sesame Street* and *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood* as shows it was comparable to, but doesn’t state its success stems *from* their success.



"
nimna madhey amsterdamka adhikariharu ra sangrahalayaley rukh sambandhi kun tarka garenan?,"The correct answer is **C: tyo dhusidwara pradushit chha** (it is contaminated by mold).

Here's why:

The passage states that Amsterdam museum officials said the building was **infected with mold** (""dhusile rookh sankramit bhaeko cha"") and posed a public health risk (""janaswasthyama yati khatra garaunchha""). This directly corresponds to the idea that the building is contaminated by mold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tyo antyama dhalerai chhadchha** (it will eventually collapse) - The passage doesn't mention the building collapsing.
*   **B: tyo jogaunu parcha** (it needs to be added) - This makes no sense in the context.
*   **D: tyo sarvasadharanko swasthako lagi hanikarak chha** (it is harmful to general health) - While the mold *is* harmful to health, the passage specifically states it's because of the *mold contamination* itself, not just a general health hazard.



"
"rspcako pramukh nirikshak anusar, nimna madhey kunko lagi nirikshanharu manak hunuparcha?","The correct answer is **B: janawarharusanga cam garney jokohi** (anyone filming animals).

Here's why:

The text states David O'Shanes (RSPCA NSW inspector) said, ""जनवरहरुसंगै क्याम गर्ने जो कोहीलाई (janawarharusanga cam garney jokohi)  तिनीहरुको कल्याण उच्चतम प्राथमिकतामा छ भनेर स्पष्ट रूपमा बताइन्छ।"" This translates to: ""Anyone filming animals must clearly indicate that the animals' welfare is their top priority.""

Therefore, according to the RSPCA inspector, *anyone* filming animals needs to be monitored/subject to scrutiny.  The other options are too specific (CCTV cameras, abattoirs) or relate to the means of monitoring rather than *who* needs monitoring.



"
"anuchhed anusar, australiali khasaikhanaka kamdaarharulai ke kura pashu kalyanko mahatwa bujhna maddat garna sakcha?","The correct answer is **A: cctv camerako sthapana (installation of CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that RSPCA is advocating for *mandatory installation of CCTV cameras* in Australian slaughterhouses. David O'Shane specifically says cameras will give a ""clear signal"" that animal welfare is a top priority. This directly implies the cameras will help workers understand and prioritize animal welfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: rspcasangako aniwarya baithakharu (mandatory RSPCA meetings):** The passage doesn't mention meetings.
* **C: niyamit kasaikhanako nirikshan (regular slaughterhouse inspections):** While inspections are mentioned as being common, the focus is on the *cameras* as a new tool to *enhance* understanding of welfare.
* **D: abcbata nirikshan (inspections from ABC):** ABC is just the news outlet reporting on the story; they aren't the ones trying to improve worker understanding.



"
"anuchhed anusar, pakrau parney wyaktiko pesha ke thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: vidhyarthi (student)**.

The passage states the arrested person is another student accused of involvement in the shooting at the Red Lake school. The line ""red lake samudayama az samachar failieko cha key march 21 co vidyalayama bhaeko golibari co aropma arko vidyarthi pakrau pareko khabar cha"" directly translates to ""news has spread in the Red Lake community that another student has been arrested on charges related to the shooting at the school on March 21"".



"
"anuchhed anusar, jaba arko pakraubarey samachar failindai thiyo, katiota piditharuko lagi antyeshti gariraheko thiyo?","The correct answer is **B: teen**.

The passage states: ""Jeff Veej ra naujana piditharumadhe teen janako antyeshti bhaeko red lake samudayama az samachar failieko cha..."" which translates to ""News has spread in the Red Lake community that the funeral of three of the nine young victims is being held...""

Therefore, when the news of another arrest surfaced, the funeral for **three** victims was being held.



"
"aandolanko jawafma, kun deshley uniharuko dastakhat gariyeko acta samjhautasanga aghi badhena?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Deshle acta maa hastakshar garnale gat mahina polandma thulo virodh pradarshan bhaeko thiyo jasle garda police sarkarle ahileka lagi samjhautalai anumodan nagarne nirnaya gareko thiyo."" This translates to ""Last month, a large protest took place in Poland regarding signing the ACTA agreement, which led the police government to decide not to approve the current agreement."" This means Poland *attempted* to sign but then backed down due to protests.  The question asks which country *advanced* with signing, and Poland initially did, even though they later reversed course.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Germany:** The text only says Germany *had* protests, not that it signed the agreement.
*   **C: Scotland:** Scotland also only had protests.
*   **D: Lithuania:** Lithuania also only had protests.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun deshharuley actasanga samel huney prakriyamaa dhilai garye?","The correct answer is **D: latvia**.

The passage states: ""Latbhiya ra slobhakia dubaile ACTA maa samel hune prakriyama dhilai gare."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia delayed the process of joining ACTA.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: estonia** - The passage mentions protests in Estonia (Tallin) but doesn't say they delayed joining ACTA.
*   **B: lithuania** - The passage mentions protests in Lithuania (Vilnius) but doesn't say they delayed joining ACTA.
*   **C: scotland** - The passage mentions protests in Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow) but doesn't say they delayed joining ACTA.



"
ipod atyadhik tateka ghatnaley kati jana manisharu ghaitey bhaye?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lagbhag 60 vata cam nagareka ipod atyadhik tateka ghatanaharu report garieko thiyo...ra char janalai samanya rupma poleko thiyo.""  This translates to: ""Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported...and four people were slightly injured.""

Therefore, the iPod overheating incidents resulted in injuries to **4** people.



"
kasley atyadhik tateka ghatnaharu dherai gambhir hudaina bhanera bhaney?,"The correct answer is **D: apple**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Applele usalai 34 vata atyadhik tapakram bhaeka ghatanaharuko barema jankari dieko thiyo, jaslai companyle """"""""gair-gambhir"""""""" bhanyo.""  This directly translates to ""Apple informed about 34 overheating incidents, which the company called """"""""not serious.""""""

Therefore, Apple is the one who stated the overheating incidents weren't serious.



"
"usko bhasan dauran, steve jobsley appleley ke punah awishkar garneycha bhaneka thiye?","The correct answer is **B: phone**.

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""aja Applele **phone** punah awishkar garna gairaheko cha, hammy az itihas banauna gairaheka chhaun."" (Today, Apple is rediscovering the **phone**, we are making history). 

The question specifically asks *what* Steve Jobs said Apple was rediscovering. The answer is clearly the phone.



"
steve jobko dui-ghanta lamo bhasanko udeshya ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: naya phone arambha garna** (to launch a new phone).

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs pulled the iPhone out of his pocket during his 2-hour speech and announced, ""Today Apple is rediscovering the phone, we are making history."" This clearly indicates the speech's purpose was to introduce a new phone – the iPhone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: naya tablet arambha garna** (to launch a new tablet) - The passage focuses on the *phone*.
*   **B: naya computer arambha garna** (to launch a new computer) - The passage focuses on the *phone*.
*   **D: unko sanyaas ghoshana garna** (to announce his retirement) - The passage describes a product launch, not a retirement announcement.



"
agrentineko theatrema Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanarley ke ghoshana garin?,"The correct answer is **A: unko rashtrapati padako ummedwari** (her candidacy for the presidency).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanar... ley bunes iresbata 50 kilometer tadha raheko sahar lah platama hijo sanjha afulai **rashtrapati padako ummedwar** ghoshana gareki chin."" This directly translates to ""...announced her **candidacy for the presidency**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: samsad ko lagi uthney unko manasaya** (her intention to rise in parliament) - The passage mentions her starting a campaign for a provincial representative but doesn't say anything about rising in parliament.
* **C: bunes ires pranta pratinidhi mandalkolagi unko abhiyan** (her campaign for the Buenos Aires provincial representative) - While she *started* a campaign for this, the main announcement in the passage is her presidential candidacy.
* **D: cineter ko pad baata raajinama garne unko yojana** (her plan to resign from her post in Cineter) - The passage doesn't mention any plans to resign.



"
Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanarley ummedwarko lagi uthney manasaya kaha ghosana garin?,"The correct answer is **B: la platako bunes ires theatre maa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wartaman cineter tatha argentinaki pratham mahila Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanar (Cristina Fernandez De Kirchner) ley **bunes iresbata 50 kilometer (31 mile) tadha raheko sahar la platama hijo sanjha afulai rashtrapati padako ummedwar ghoshana gareki chin.**"" 

This directly translates to: ""Current senator and Argentina's first lady Cristina Fernandez De Kirchner announced her candidacy for the presidency **in the city of La Plata, located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.**""  The announcement was made *in* the Bunes Ires Theatre *in* La Plata.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Mentions a distance of 31 miles *from* a theatre, not *in* a theatre *in* La Plata.
* **C:**  States ""Argentine theatre,"" which isn't specific enough – the text names the ""Bunes Ires"" theatre.
* **D:** Incorrectly combines ""Bunes Ires"" and ""La Plata"" - it's the Bunes Ires Theatre *in* La Plata.



"
big bradarko sambandhama acmako nishkarshaharu ke thiye?,"The correct answer is **C: censorship kanunharu ullanghan garieko paiyo** (they found that censorship laws were violated).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...big bradarle unline samagri censorship kanunko ullanghan gareka thienan"" which directly translates to ""...Big Brother violated the censorship laws online content.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: censorship kanunharu ullanghan gariyeko thiena** (censorship laws were not violated) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage states.
* **B: big bradarko websitema media bhandaran gariyeko paiyo** (media was stored on Big Brother's website) -  While mentioned, this is *why* the ACMA investigated, not the *finding* of the investigation.
* **D: samagri euta serverma bhautik rupma basiraheko bhetiyo** (content was found to physically reside on a server) - The passage discusses the need for physical copies for regulation, but doesn't state that this was *found* to be the case with Big Brother.  It's a general point about internet regulation.



"
internet samagri bhanera maninako lagi meida kun mapdanda antargat parnuparcha?,"The correct answer is **B: yo bhautik rupma sarbharma rahanuparchha** (it must be available in physical form).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...internet samagri maninka lagi yo bhautik rupma kunai sarbharma rahanuparchha"" - ""...for internet content to be considered, it must be available in physical form."" 

The question asks what media falls under the definition of ""internet content"" for regulation. The passage directly states that to be considered, the content needs a physical form.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yo internetma stream hunuparchha** (it must be streamed online) - The passage discusses regulation *of* online content, not what *defines* it.
*   **C: yo websitema bhandaran gariyeko hunuhunna** (it must be stored on a website) - The passage specifically mentions the Big Brother website *lacking* a media repository and potentially censoring content.
*   **D: yo acmadwara swikrit hunuparchha** (it must be approved by ACMA) - Approval isn't a defining characteristic of the content itself, but rather a potential step in the regulatory process.



"
australia liberal partyko neta ko hun?,"The correct answer is **A: Pitter Coastelo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pitter Coastelo, astreliaka koshadhyaksha ra sambhawatah pradhanmantri zone hoardko uttaradhikari hoon sakne liberal partyka netale astreliama raheko anawik shakti udyogka pachadi afno samarthan dieka chan.""  This translates to ""Pitter Costello, Australian Treasurer and a Liberal Party leader potentially succeeding Prime Minister John Howard, is supporting the nuclear power industry in Australia.""

Therefore, Pitter Coastelo is identified as the Liberal Party leader.



"
australiasanga pahiley nai anawik shakti udhyog kina chaina?,"The correct answer is **A: sarvasadharan ko samarthanko kami** (lack of public support).

Here's why:

The text states Costello believes nuclear energy is economically viable and Australia *should* use it. His reasoning isn't about it being dangerous, expensive, or inherently controversial (though it *is* potentially controversial). He states ""If this is commercial, we should be in it."" and ""that there is no principled objection to nuclear energy.""  This implies the biggest hurdle isn't technical or ethical, but rather acceptance by the general public.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: atti vivadaspad (highly controversial):** While nuclear energy *can* be controversial, Costello’s statement suggests he doesn't see a *principled* objection, implying he believes it's an issue of practicality, not inherent moral wrongness.
* **C: atti khatarnak (highly dangerous):**  The text doesn't mention safety concerns as a reason for Australia's hesitancy.
* **D: atti mahango (highly expensive):** Costello specifically argues it is *economically* viable, meaning not too expensive.



"

The text states: ""Polandka purushatarfako drishtiwihin skier maciej Krezel ra margdarshak Anna Ogarzynska ley super-zeema tehraun sthanma khel pura gare.""  This means Maciej Krezel completed the race *with* the help of a guide. Anna Ogarzynska was his guide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: anna jochemsen** - She is mentioned as a skier, not a guide.
* **B: jong seork park** - He competed independently.
* **D: anna ogarzynska** - She was the *guide*, not the skier receiving assistance.



"

The text states: ""...mahila standing wargama nawaun sthanma samapta gurney anna jochemsenko sath super-zeema netherlandlai ra sohi pratiyogitama dashaun sthanma samapta gurney katja sarinenko sathama finlandlai sammilit gare."" This translates to: ""...in the women's standing category, Gurney with Anna Jochemsenko finished in ninth place for the Netherlands and in the same competition, Gurney with Katja Sarinenko finished in tenth place for Finland.""

Therefore, the Netherlands finished in tenth place in the women's standing super-G.

"anuchhed anusar, blakebarey kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **B: unle akraman swikar gare** (He confessed to the attack).

Here's why:

The passage states Blake *denied* (aswikar gare) committing the attack. Therefore, saying he *confessed* to the attack is false.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: unlai ghatnasthalma pakrau gariyo** (He was arrested at the scene) - The passage says he was apprehended at the scene (""Ghatanasthalma pakrau pareka"").
*   **C: unle akramanko kramma khamba ko prayog gare** (He used bottles as weapons in the attack) - The passage states 30 people used bottles to attack (""tees jana manisharule afulai haneka bottleharubata jogin khaanbaako prayog gareko davi gare""). While it doesn't *directly* say Blake used a bottle, it's implied he was involved in the attack where bottles were used.
*   **D: unle afu bottleharu fyakieko dabi gare** (He claimed he threw bottles) - This aligns with the description of the attack involving bottles.



"
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhye blakelai ke bhayena?","The correct answer is **A: unlai nyayako bato bigarne doshi paaiyo** (He was found guilty of obstructing justice).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Blake lai nyayako bato bigarne prayaska lagi pani doshi thaharaieko thiyo."" This directly translates to ""Blake was also found guilty of attempting to obstruct justice.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: unlai pakrau gariyo** (He was arrested) - The text mentions someone was *arrested* at the scene, but doesn't say Blake was.
* **C: unlai khambaley akraman gariyo** (He assaulted the pillar) - The text says people *used* bottles, not that Blake assaulted anything.
* **D: unlai jail pathaine sambhawana chha bhanera bhaniyo** (It was said there was a possibility he would be sent to jail) - The text states the judge considered the punishment unavoidable and *sent* him to jail, not that it was just a possibility.



"
sanyukta rashtrasanghle vishwawyapi ushnata kosh keko lagi prayog hudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: vishwawyapi ushnata ko prabhawharu kam garna (to reduce the effects of global warming)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...sanyukta rashtrasanghale yasasambandhi koshlai antim roop dine asha rakheko cha"" (the United Nations hopes to finalize a fund related to this) and ""...vishwawyapi ushnatale prabhawa pareka deshharulai yasaka asarharusanga samana garna sahayog garna..."" (to help countries affected by global warming cope with its effects).  This clearly indicates the fund's purpose is to mitigate the *effects* of global warming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: anna vividhikaran (food diversification):** While the passage *mentions* food diversification as something the fund *could* support, it's not the primary purpose of the fund itself.
*   **B: vikashshil deshharuma praidhi lyauna (bringing technology to developing countries):**  Again, this is something the fund might facilitate, but not its core purpose.
*   **C: badhirodhi gharharu (flood-resistant houses):** This is a specific example of adaptation, but the fund is intended for broader impact than just building houses.



"
"anuchhed anusar, sanyukta rashtrasangh ke bachauney asha rakheko cha?","The correct answer is **C: baaki raheka jungleharu** (remaining jungles).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Balima so agendama any vishayaharuma vishwaka baaki raheka jungle bachaunu..."" which translates to ""The agenda includes saving the remaining jungles of the world...""  The United Nations hopes to finalize a fund related to this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: paisa, praidhi sajha garera** (sharing money, technology) - While the passage mentions needing funds and technology, the UN is focused on *what* to save, not just *how* to save it.
* **B: annaharu** (foods) -  The passage mentions food diversification as a way to help, but the UN isn't trying to ""save"" foods directly.
* **D: paniko kamjor wyawasthapanley prabhawit manisharu** (people affected by poor water management) - The passage mentions better water management, but the focus isn't on saving the *people* affected, but rather addressing the larger issue of environmental preservation.



"
nimna madhey kun albert muchangaley kehi kura ajhai sammat hunu parney awashyak cha bhanera ullekhit gareko chaina?,"Correct answer is **B: wyapar suru huna sakney miti**.

Here's why:

Albert Muchanga clearly states that the framework they have is *sufficient* to begin trade on July 1, 2020. This implies the date itself is *not* something that needs further agreement.

He specifically mentions that rules of origin (C) and tariff concessions (D) haven't been fully agreed upon yet. He also doesn't mention Benin's potential obstacles to joining AfCFTA (A).

Therefore, the only thing he *doesn't* say needs further agreement is the trade start date.



"
"anuchhed anusar, wyapar kina julyma suru hunasakcha?","The correct answer is **B: tyaha niyamharu ra chutharuko paryapta samrachana awasthit chha** (There is sufficient framework of rules and tariffs).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hamile ahilesamma utpattika niyamharu ra shulkadar riyayatharu swikar gareka chhainaun tar hamisanga bhaeko ruparekha july 1, 2020 maa wyapar suru garna paryapta cha."" This translates to ""We have not yet agreed on rules of origin and tariff concessions, but the framework we have is sufficient to start trading on July 1, 2020.""

This directly indicates that while *everything* wasn't finalized, the *existing framework* was enough to begin trade in July.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say Nigeria's terms were the reason trade could start in July. It highlights the lack of complete agreement on rules.
* **C:** The AU Trade and Industry Commissioner's statement is about the *existing* framework being sufficient, not about confirming it's ""correct.""
* **D:** The passage explicitly states they haven't *agreed* on rules of origin and tariffs, making this option incorrect.

"anuchhed anusar, atlanta journal-constitutionley shikshya adhikariharulai keko dosh lagaye?","The correct answer is **C: fela pareko antarik samasyaharuma karya nagareko**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Reportle dekhayo key pariksha ankaharu drut gatile badheka thee ra yasale vidyalayale antarik samasyaharu patta lagaeko tar khojharuma karya nagareko arop lagayo."" This translates to ""The report showed that test scores had increased rapidly and accused the schools of identifying internal problems but not acting on them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: journal-constitution report chhedchhad garieko** - While the text mentions cheating on tests *after* the report, the report itself didn't accuse officials of cheating.
*   **B: sahari shikshya sudharna asafal bhayeko** - The report came *after* initial improvement in test scores, so it didn’t accuse them of failing to improve education.
*   **D: kam parikshya natijaharu report gariyeko** - The newspaper *published* a report *about* the test results, it didn't accuse officials of reporting low test results.



"
"anuchhedma dieko jankariko adharma, atlanta journal-Constitutionko reportma ke ullekhit chaina?","Correct answer is **D: sahari shikshako sudharna sujhavharu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report pointed out problems with the test results, alleging the schools covered up internal problems instead of investigating them. It mentions inflated test scores and cheating on answer sheets.
*   **Option D** is not mentioned in the passage. The passage focuses on *problems* with the education system, not suggestions for improvement.
*   **Option A** is mentioned: The passage states ""Atlanta schools saw a dramatic improvement in test scores.""
*   **Option B** is mentioned: ""Evidence emerged that answer sheets had been altered.""
*   **Option C** is mentioned: ""In 2009, she was honored with the national superintendent of the year award.""

Therefore, the only information *not* included in the passage regarding the issues is suggestions for improving urban education."
"anuchhed anusar, bum wisfot pachi ke jankari thaha vayo?","The correct answer is **A: ghaiteyko antim sankhya** (the final number of injured).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...adhikarik pratiwedanle kamtima 30 jana ghaite bhaeko pushti gareko thiyo; tar antim sankhya ajhai thaha hoon sakeko chhaina."" - This directly translates to ""...official reports confirmed at least 30 people were injured; but the final number is still unknown.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kun samrachanaharu najik bum wisfot vaye** (which structures the explosions happened near) - The passage mentions explosions near government buildings, but doesn't detail *which* specific buildings.
* **C: yedi thap bum wisfot garnu parcha bhanera** (who needed to plant the explosions) - The passage doesn't mention anything about who was responsible.
* **D: mritak haruko aupachaarik sankhya** (the unofficial number of deaths) -  The passage refers to conflicting reports about the *number* of deaths (some said 8), but specifically states the final number is unknown.  It doesn't mention an *unofficial* number.



"
"2017 ma manchester cityma samel bhayepachi, jesusley katiwata khel khele?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tyas beladekhi, brazilianle clubka lagi sabai pratiyogitaharuma **53 khel maa pradarshan gareko cha** ra 24 goal gareko cha."" (Since then, the Brazilian played **53 games** for the club and scored 24 goals.)

This refers to Jesus's performance *after* joining Manchester City. Therefore, the answer is 53."
jesusley kun clubma samel vayeko bapat £27 million shulka prapta gare?,"The correct answer is **B: manchester city**.

The text states: ""...Jesus gat warsha janawari 2017 maa brazilian club palmeirasbata £27 million shulk tirera **manchester cityma** samel bhae."" (Jesus in January 2017 from Brazilian club Palmeiras for a fee of £27 million joined **Manchester City**.)



"
hostelka pahunaharubarey kun kathan satya hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: bahumat pahunaharu pavitra saharbata thiye** (the majority of guests were from the holy city).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the hostel had ""dherai pahuna sanyukta arab imirateska nagarik thee"" (many guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates). This directly contradicts the idea that the *majority* were from the holy city (Mecca).

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the text:

*   **A: pahunaharu tirthayatrakolagi meccama thiye** (the guests were in Mecca for pilgrimage) - The text says many pilgrims were arriving to tour the holy city before Hajj, suggesting they were there for pilgrimage.
*   **B: kehi pahunaharu sthaniya nagarik thiyenan** (some guests were local citizens) -  The text doesn’t *explicitly* state this, but it's reasonable to assume some locals could be staying in a hostel. It doesn't contradict the information given.
*   **C: pahunaharu tyaha hajjko purva sandhyakolagi thiye** (the guests were there for the eve of Hajj) - The text states the incident happened ""Hajj yatrako purva sandhyama"" (on the eve of Hajj), supporting this statement.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **B: sabai pahunaharu samyukta arab imiratesbata thiye** (All the guests were from the United Arab Emirates).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hostalka dherai pahuna sanyukta arab imirateska nagarik thee"" (Many guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates).  This means *some* were from the UAE, but doesn't say *all* were.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: tyaha kasaiko mirtyu bhayena** (No one died there) - This is false, as the passage states ""Mrityu toll kamtima 15 raheko cha"" (The death toll is at least 15).
* **C: pahunaharu hajj tirthayatrako purva sandhyakalagi tyaha thiye** (The guests were there for the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage) - This is true; the passage states ""Haz yatrako purva sandhyama pavitra shaharko bhraman garna dherai tirthayatriharu aeka thee.""
* **D: bahumat pahunaharu meccaka sthaniyaharu thiye** (The majority of the guests were locals of Mecca) - While not explicitly stated, it's logical to assume many tirthayatriharu (pilgrims) visiting Mecca would be locals or from Saudi Arabia, which makes this a reasonable inference even if it isn't directly stated.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that directly contradicts the information provided in the passage."
"anuchhedko adharma,thakkarbarey kun jankari nischit chaina?","The correct answer is **C: thakkar ko prithvima asar** (the impact of the explosion on Earth).

Here's why:

The passage states scientists are *still trying* to determine how the explosion affected the Earth (""prithvi kasari prabhawit hunechha bhane nirdharan garna ajhai pani cosis gardaichhan""). This means the impact is currently *uncertain*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thakkar ko akar** (the size of the explosion) - The passage states the explosion was ""thulo thiyo"" (large), indicating a known size.
*   **B: thakkar ko sthan** (the location of the explosion) - The passage mentions South Africa (""dakshin africama"") as a specific location with numbers related to the infection, implying the explosion occurred there.
*   **D: bhatkeka awasheshharuko sthan** (the location of the debris) - The US Department of Defense is *tracking* the debris, meaning its location is being determined, not unknown.



"
"anuchhed anusar, thakkarbarey ajhai ke nishchit garna awashak cha?","The correct answer is **D: durghatanako sahi maan** (the true scale of the disaster).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiniharu durghatana kathi thulo thiyo ra prithvi kasari prabhawit hunechha bhane nirdharan garna ajhai pani cosis gardaichhan.""  This translates to: ""They are still trying to determine how big the disaster was and how the earth has been affected."" This clearly indicates they *haven't* yet determined the true scale (sahi maan) of the disaster.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bhatkeka awasheshharu kasley track garcha** (how the debris is being tracked): The passage states the US Department of Defense is tracking debris, but doesn’t ask *how* they are tracking it.
* **B: thakkarko samayma upagrahaharu kati chhito yatra gariraheka thiye** (how many satellites were orbiting during the disaster): This information isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: plotting vishleshanko natija kasari sajha garincha** (how the analysis results are shared): The passage states results are put on a public website, not *how* they are shared.

"
nimna madhey kunma battenley dan gare?,"The correct answer is **A: sabaibhanda dhani amerikiharuko suchi** (the list of the wealthiest Americans).

The passage explicitly states that Batten was ranked 190th on a list of the 400 wealthiest Americans in 2008. The question asks what Battenley donated *to*, and the passage indicates it was to a list (specifically, being *on* the list).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: virginia wiswawidalaya** - Batten graduated *from* Virginia University, he didn't donate to it in this context.
*   **C: dherai sangathanharu** - The passage doesn't mention any donations to many organizations.
*   **D: kala ra vigyankolagi samarpit collegeharu** - While he graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences at Virginia, the passage doesn’t state he donated to colleges dedicated to arts and sciences.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the law applies to the sale of violent video games *within* California (""california rajyama bechieko""). It doesn't mention any restrictions on sales *outside* of California.  The law focuses on what happens *inside* the state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: californiabhari sana bachchaharulaihinsatmak bhidiyo gameharuko bikri wa bhadama pratibandha** - This *is* part of the law, as the passage mentions restrictions on sales to minors in California.
*   **B: apradhiharulai arthik jariwana** - This *is* part of the law, detailing the $1000 fine for selling to minors.
*   **D: hinsatmak bhidiyo gameharuma decal ko awashyakta** - This *is* part of the law, requiring an ""18"" label on violent games.

"anuchhed anusar, kasley vaniyeka chijharu chuttaye?","The correct answer is **A: duvallko bacchaharu**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Vivah garera dui wayaska bachchaharu bhaeka dubhalle millerma thulo chap chhodenan..."" (Two young children who got married caused a big commotion with Duvall, and Miller...). This directly indicates that the children of Duvall are the ones causing the commotion (the ""chuttaye"" - commotion/disturbance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mike:** Mike is only mentioned as someone the children are talking *about*, not as someone *causing* the commotion.
*   **C: Miller:** Miller is reacting *to* the commotion, but isn't the source of it.
*   **D: Duvall:** While the commotion happens *with* Duvall, it's the children who are the direct cause.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: """"sunuwaiko samayama mike dherai bolchhan..."""" which translates to ""During the children's time, they were talking a lot...""  This refers to the two children of Duvall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sunwaiko bela duvallley millermathi ramro prabhav pare** (During the children's time, Duvall had a good influence on Miller) - The passage doesn't mention any influence, good or bad.
*   **B: uni tayar hunda unle khyal gariraheko thiyenan** (He wasn't paying attention to the unleashed while getting ready) -  The passage says he was *aware* of the ""unle"" (presumably the children's noise) while getting ready, not ignoring it. He was ""sanchchai nai suniraheko thein"" - meaning he was definitely listening.
*   **D: unle duvallko kathalai ramro sanga dhyan diraheka thiye** (He was paying good attention to Duvall's stories) - The passage does not mention Duvall telling stories or Miller paying attention to them.

“swachcha hawasambadhi ein” lai samsodhan garnuparcha vanera kasley sujhav garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: jack layton**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leton (Layton) ley conservative partyko watawarniya widheyakko """"wistrit ra purna punarlekhan"""" ca lagi agraha gardai pradhanmantrisangko bhetma conservativeko watawarniya vidheyakma parivartan garna agraha gareka thee.""  This translates to ""Layton insisted on amending the Conservative party's environmental bill during his meeting with the Prime Minister, insisting on changes to the Conservative party's environmental bill.""

""Swachcha hawasambandhi ein"" refers to the environmental bill, and Jack Layton is the one who proposed it be amended/revised.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: zone hoard** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: conservative party** - Layton *requested changes to* their bill, he didn't suggest it needed amending himself.
*   **D: stephen harper** - Harper was the one *receiving* the request for amendment, not making it.

This translates to: ""Prime Minister Steffen Harper met with NDP leader Jack Layton on Tuesday for 25 minutes after which he agreed to send the government's 'clean air' second hearing to a bipartisan committee for review.""

Jack Layton, the NDP leader, is the one directly involved in discussions about the ""swachcha hawasambandhi ein"" (clean air plan) and questioning its process, suggesting it's a show before the election.  Therefore, he's the one who would be condemning it as an election stunt.

cyanuric acid ra melamine yaugikharuley ke banaye jaba tiniharu biraloko pisabma ekarkasanga pratikriya garye?,"The correct answer is **C: crystalharu (crystals)**.

(University researchers reacted the two compounds **to form crystals**...).  The research focuses on *what* is formed when cyanuric acid and melamine react in urine.

*   **B: gharpaluwa janawarko khaneykura (pet food)** - The passage mentions contaminated pet food *being the source* of the problem, not what the compounds create.
*   **D: infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)** - FTIR is a *method used to analyze* the crystals, not what the compounds form.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) marfat tulana garda yea crystalharu sankramit gharapaluwa pashuharuko mutrama fella parekaharusanga mail khanchha.""  This directly translates to ""Comparing using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), these crystals matched those found in the urine of infected animals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mirgaulako karya (deer's work):** The passage mentions deer only in the context of potentially blocking kidney function – it doesn't say FTIR was used to study the deer themselves.
* **C: prabhawit bhayeka gharpaluwa janawarharu (affected animals):** FTIR was used to analyze *crystals from* affected animals, not the animals themselves.
* **D: gharpaluwa janawarko dushit khaneykura (contaminated food of animals):** The passage focuses on the crystals in urine, not the contaminated food.

The text states: ""Tomy Dreamerle bhane """"""""Luna atyadhiktako pahili rani hunuhunthyo."""""" This directly translates to ""Tomy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first queen of excess.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: usley gharma bhayeka kunai pani wyaktiharulai chotpatak purayena** (He didn't injure anyone in the car) - The text states *no one* in the car was injured, not specifically that the driver didn't injure them.
* **C: uslai cambridgeko aspatalbata great yarmouthma sario** (He was treated in Great Yarmouth from Cambridge hospital) - The text says he was *initially* taken to Great Yarmouth and *then* to Cambridge.
* **D: apatkalin sewaharule uslai usko gadibata nikalna maddat garye** (Emergency services helped him get out of his car) - While likely true, the text focuses on the injury, not the rescue effort.



"
rugby pratiyogitako dauran south africako khelbarey kun kura le dhyan akarshit garena?,"The correct answer is **C: pratiyogitako suruwatma ekdum ramro pradarshan**.

Here's why:

The text states South Africa initially struggled against Zambia, despite being the favorites. It mentions they ""appeared helpless"" against their southern African rivals. This indicates their start wasn't strong. The passage *does* highlight their teamwork (prabhakari tolly sahakarya), ball handling skills (ball samhalne kaushal), and defensive abilities (rakshatmak khubiharu).  Therefore, a good start is the only thing *not* emphasized as a factor in their performance.

The passage states: ""Afna dakshini didibahiniharuka viruddha khelma nirnayatmak rupma asaksham dekhine dakshin africale pratispardhako pragatianusar lagatar sudhar garyo."" This translates to: ""South Africa initially appeared helpless against their southern sibling teams, but **as the competition progressed**, they consistently improved.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 10:00 tira** - The passage states the game *started* at 10:00, but doesn't mention improvement happening at that specific time.
*   **B: raksha baliyo banaye pachi** - While the passage mentions a disciplined defense (""anushasita raksha paddhati""), it doesn't say improvement *happened after* strengthening the defense. It says the defense was *part of* what made them stand out.
*   **C: zambiasanga haare pachi** - They *won* against Zambia, they didn't lose.  The improvement wasn't linked to a loss.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dui dashak bhitrama sanyukta rajya americako bhanda chinko gdp mathi jaan sakne cha."" which translates to ""Within two decades, China's GDP may surpass that of the United States.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thap aarthik suharharu pachi** (after the major economic reforms) - While reforms *led* to the potential for surpassing the US, the passage specifies a *timeframe* for when it might happen.
* **C: jaba desh naya netritwama huncha** (when the country has new leadership) - The passage doesn't link GDP surpassing the US to changes in leadership.
* **D: teen dashak bhitra** (within three decades) - The passage specifically states *two* decades, not three.



"
huley vikasonmukh deshharulai ke garna sujhav diye?,"The correct answer is **A: tyasto dayitwa linu jasley uniharuko vikas charanlai dhakalcha** (to take responsibility that pushes their development stage).

Here's why:

The passage states Hami is advocating for reducing carbon dioxide emissions significantly, but acknowledges they haven't set concrete reduction targets based on China's economic output. They then state they are pushing developing nations to ""first pollute and then clean up,"" but also argue against forcing them to take on responsibilities *beyond* their development stage, capacity, and resources.

This implies Hami believes developing nations should take *some* responsibility, but it should be a responsibility that is compatible with and *supports* their continued development, not hinders it.  Option A reflects this nuance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: arthik parinamma dhyan kendrit garnu** (focus on economic results) - The passage implies Hami is prioritizing economic growth (for China) and acknowledging developing nations need it too. This isn't a suggestion *to* developing nations, but a description of the situation.
* **C: halko jimmewariharu bhanda aghi janu** (go beyond lighter responsibilities) - This directly contradicts the passage which argues *against* burdening them with responsibilities they aren't equipped to handle.
* **D: pradusanko purano margabata joginu** (to pollute through the old way) - While Hami initially suggests the ""first pollute, then clean"" approach, they also clarify they don't want to *force* this upon developing nations, and the focus isn't on encouraging pollution.



"
hule ke ullekh garenan?,"The correct answer is **D: carbon utsarjan katauti ko matra** (the amount of carbon emission reduction).

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Hami 2005 ko starbata 2020 sammama GDP ko prati ekai carbon dioxide utsarjanlai ullekhaniya marginbata katauti gurney prayas garnechhaun"" (We will try to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP from the 2005 level by 2020).  However, it then continues to say they *haven't* determined specific figures for the reduction.  The passage focuses on the *attempt* to reduce emissions, but not *by how much*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: katauti ko adhar** (the basis of reduction) - The passage doesn't discuss *what* the reduction is based on, just that it's related to GDP.
*   **B: vikasonmukh deshharulai pradusan sambandhi sallaha** (advice regarding pollution to developing countries) - This is what *they are telling* developing countries, but it's not what *they* are lacking or not mentioning about their own goals.
*   **C: euta miti jun belasamma carbon utsarjan katine asha** (a timeframe within which carbon emissions will be reduced) - The passage *does* mention a timeframe (2005-2020), so it's not something they are not mentioning.



"
nimna madhey kunko lagi Bhermanle paristhiti ramro chaina bhane?,"The correct answer is **B: angola**.

Here's why:

The text states Richard Bherman (from Medecines Sans Frontiers) said, ""Angola ahile sabaibhanda kharab prakopma gairaheko cha ra angolako awastha dherai nai kharab cha"" which translates to ""Angola is currently facing the worst outbreak and the situation in Angola is very bad.""  He is directly saying the situation is bad *for Angola*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: medicines Suns Frontiers:** Bherman *works for* Medicines Sans Frontiers, he isn't saying their situation is bad.
* **C: mangola:**  The text mentions Mangola as the place the medical charity is reporting *from*, but Bherman specifically focuses on the situation in Angola.
* **D: vishwa swasthya sangathan (World Health Organization):** The text states the charity reported *to* the WHO, it doesn't say Bherman believes the WHO's situation is bad.



"
"muddako karan, kasley huhneko mantrimandal ko pad linecha?","The correct answer is **D: pryce**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Sarvajanik abhiyojan nirdeshak, **kear starmer** cuciele, az bihan euta bayan dindi hhne ra **pryce** co mudda chalaune ghoshana gareka thee."" This directly links Pryce to the case/issue (""mudda"").  Later it states Pryce resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet.

The question asks for the *reason for the case* and *who left the cabinet position*. The text identifies Pryce as the one involved in the case and the one who resigned from a cabinet position.



"
muddako khulasasangai wyapar mantriko bhumika kasley dharana garnechha?,"The correct answer is **A: lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""debhile khali gareka wyapar mantriko pada norman lamb mpley line apeksha garieko cha."" This directly translates to ""Norman Lamb is expected to fill the vacant position of Trade Minister.""

Therefore, Norman Lamb will be taking on the role of Trade Minister."
camille saint-Saensko opera dauran kalakarharuley shrotalai ke garna protsahit garchan?,"The correct answer is **A: ganjako prayog garna** (to experiment with cannabis).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Natijako rupma, kalakarharule stagema ganja seven garchhan ra natakghar aafainle shrotaharulai samel hoon protsahit gariraheko hunchha."" This translates to ""Finally, the artists smoke cannabis on stage and the smell of the theater encourages the audience to join in.""

Therefore, the artists are encouraging the audience to participate in cannabis use.



"
operako dauraan kasley ganjaharu seven garchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: kalakarharu** (artists).

The text states: ""Natijako rupma, kalakarharule stagema ganja seven garchhan..."" which translates to ""Finally, the artists smoked marijuana on stage...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kalakaar (artist)** - While singular, the text indicates *multiple* artists.
* **B: franceli shrota (French audience)** - The text does not mention the audience smoking marijuana.
* **D: camille saint-Saens** - Camille Saint-Saëns is the composer, not someone involved in smoking marijuana on stage according to the text.



"
leonovley pradarsan gareko “spacewak” ko arko nam ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: atiriktawahan gatiwidhi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""March 18, 1965 maa, unle pahilo manav **atiriktawahan gatiwidhi** (EVA) wa """"spacewak"""" pradarshan garera...""  This directly translates to ""On March 18, 1965, he demonstrated the first human **extravehicular activity** (EVA), or """"spacewalk"""".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: apollo-Soyuz abhiyan:** This was a mission Leonov *later* led, not another name for the spacewalk itself.
*   **B: antariksha daud:** This refers to the Space Race, which the Apollo-Soyuz mission *ended*, not the spacewalk.
*   **D: antariksha yatri number 11:** This is a nickname, not the name of the spacewalk.



"
leonovley sobhiyat sanghako abhiyanko kun bhagko netritwa gareko thiye?,"The correct answer is **B: apollo-soyuz**.

The text states: ""Dash barshapachhi, unle epolo-soyuz abhiyanko sobhiyat bhagko netritwa gare jasle antariksha daud samapta bhaeko sanket garyo."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which signaled the end of the space race).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: antariksha daud (space race)** - He *signaled the end* of the space race with the mission, but didn't lead the race itself.
*   **C: antariksha yatri number 11 (cosmonaut number 11)** - This is his designation, not a mission he led.
*   **D: eva (spacewalk)** - He was the first to perform an EVA, but this isn't the mission he led later.



"
durghatnama ko ghaitey bhayeka thiye?,"The correct answer is **D: ek truck chalak** (a truck driver).

Here's why:

The text states: ""64 warshe truck chalak durghatanama ghaite bhaenan."" This directly translates to ""A 64-year-old truck driver was injured in the accident."" While Gibsan was *taken* to the hospital and later died, the person *injured* was the truck driver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gibsan** - Gibsan died *after* being taken to the hospital, he wasn't initially injured in the accident.
*   **B: euta gyarej kaamdaar** - The garage worker *witnessed* the aftermath, they weren't injured.
*   **C: bachchaharu** - The children were scared and ran away, but weren't reported as injured.



"
durghatanama samlagna manisharulai ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **C: uniharu karai ra roiraheka thiye** (they were crying and weeping).

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""tyahan bachchaharu sadak paar garna parkhiraheka thee ra tiniharu sabai jana karairaheka ra roiraheka thee."" (There were children waiting to cross the road and they were all crying and weeping.)  It also says they *ran away* from the scene.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uniharu dubai ko mrityu bhayo** (they died in Dubai) - The text doesn't mention Dubai. Gibson died in the hospital *after* the accident.
* **B: eutalai kehi bhayena, aarko ko mrityu bhayo** (nothing happened to them, someone else died) -  The text focuses on their emotional state (crying and running away) not whether they were physically unharmed.
* **D: dubailai chotpatak lagyo** (Dubai got injured) - Again, Dubai is not mentioned in the text.



"
nimna madhey kunwapat bhayeka asarharu awalokan garna karyakramma kaam gariraheka waigyanikharuley asha gariraheka chan?,"The correct answer is **D: dark matter**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the program was created to simulate the influence of dark matter in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and to understand the effect between the dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.  It describes how the program is trying to understand how dark matter influences other dark matter, similar to how the moon affects Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: samanya padartha (ordinary matter):** While ordinary matter exists, the passage focuses specifically on *dark* matter's influence.
* **B: jwalanta shaktiharu (burning forces/energies):**  The passage mentions energy *resulting* from the interaction of dark matter, but isn't primarily investigating the energies themselves.
* **C: sano kanaharu (small particles):** While the passage mentions dark matter being formed from particles over many years, the scientists are investigating the overall *effect* of dark matter, not the particles directly.



"
nimna madhey kun padhartha vaigyanikharuley awlokan gariraheka chan?,"The correct answer is **D: dhanu akashganga ra milky way akashganga**.

Here's why:

The passage states the program was written to simulate the observation of the *Sagittarius dwarf galaxy* (dhanu akashganga) and was investigating the effect of dark matter on the *Milky Way* (milky way akashganga).  The scientists are observing these two galaxies to understand how dark matter interacts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: milky way ra chandrama** - The passage mentions the Milky Way, but not specifically the moon (chandrama) in the context of the scientific observation.
*   **B: prithvi ra dhanu akashganga** - While the passage mentions the Sagittarius galaxy (dhanu akashganga), it does not say scientists are observing Earth (prithvi).
*   **C: prithvi ra chandrama** - Neither Earth nor the moon are the subject of the scientists' observations described in the passage.



"
"annuchedko adharma, kattarpanthiharule kun kurako alochana gardainan?","The correct answer is **A: rahat kharcha**.

Here's why:

The passage states the dispute (""vivad"") revolved around relief and reconstruction costs (""aandhibehari katrinaka sambandhama rahat tatha punarnirmanma kharcha""). It then says certain financial fundamentalists (""kehi wittiya kattarpanthiharule"") labelled this with a dismissive term (""busko naya orleans dill"").  The core of what they're criticizing is the *cost* of relief, not the effort of rebuilding itself, or who gets the contracts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: punarnirmanma prayatnako kami (lack of rebuilding effort):** The passage doesn't suggest criticism of the effort itself, only the financial side.
* **C: punarnirmanko thekkaharu kaslai pradan garindai cha (who is awarded reconstruction contracts):** The passage mentions focusing on *who* is awarded contracts (""theka pradan garekoma kendrit raheko cha"") as part of liberal criticism, but doesn't say the fundamentalists are criticizing this.
* **D: punarnirmanko kharcha (reconstruction cost):**  While the passage mentions reconstruction cost overall, the fundamentalists are specifically reacting to the *relief* costs *as well*. The core of their criticism is the combined relief and reconstruction expenses.



"
aandhibehari katrinako rahat prayatnaharukolagi punarnirman thekkaharuko alochanha kasley gariraheko cha?,"The correct answer is **B: liberals**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Punah rnirman prayasko liberal alochana kathit washington bhitrakalai punah rnirman theka pradan garekoma kendrit raheko cha."" This translates to: ""The liberal critique of the reconstruction efforts focused on alleged Washington insiders awarding reconstruction contracts.""

Therefore, liberals are the ones doing the criticizing/evaluating of the reconstruction contracts.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kahabata stardust antariksha yanka battiharu pahiley dekhincha?","The correct answer is **B: uttari california**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Capsule dherai hadasamma akashtarfa jaandai gareko ek shooting tarah jastai dekhinechha...yo nardharnauttari california paschimi tatama sarchha ra californiabata madhya oregon hundai nebhada ra idaho hundai yutako akashma ujyalo parnecha.""  This translates to: ""The capsule will be seen like a shooting star...this spacecraft will appear over the western coast of Northern California and light up the skies from California through central Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho.""

Therefore, Northern California is the first location mentioned where people will see the Stardust spacecraft.



"
"anuchhed anusar, antariksha yanley nimna madhey keko kirtiman kayam gardacha?","The correct answer is **C: prithvima sabaibhanda chhito farkine** (the fastest orbit of Earth).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stardust prithvima farkanka lagi sabaibhanda chhito antariksha yanka lagi naya sarva-samay kirtiman sthapit garnechha..."" which translates to ""Stardust will establish a new all-time record for the fastest space travel around Earth...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: akashko sabaibhanda farakilo dayara ujyalo parne** (brightest circle of light in the sky) - The passage mentions it *will* brighten the sky, but doesn't say it's the brightest ever.
* **B: sabaibhanda dherai saharma dekhine** (looks the most like a shooting star) -  This is a *description* of how it will *appear*, not a record it's breaking.
* **D: sabaibhanda chhito san francisco dekhi los angeles samma yatra garne** (fastest travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles) - The passage mentions the travel time but doesn't claim it’s a speed record *between those two cities*.  The speed relates to orbit, not point-to-point travel.



"
dr. Maller Balasubramaniamko Saroja Balasubramaniansaga ke sambandha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: aama**.

The text states: ""...unaki ama afno karko dibbama mrit awasthama fella pareki hunale unko hatya gurney abhiyog lagnechha..."" which translates to ""...his mother was found dead in his car..."" and ""...53 warshe Saroja Balasubramanian co shab ragatko dag lageko kamballe dhakieko bhettae..."" which translates to ""...53 year old Saroja Balasubramanian was found covered in a blood-stained blanket..."" 

This clearly indicates Saroja Balasubramanian was Dr. Maller Balasubramaniam's mother.



"
Sara Balasubramanianko shab kaha fela pareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: carko dibbima**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Unle adhikariharulai 500 fitko durima raheko afno callo rangkooldsmobile intrigue kartarf nirdeshit garin. Tyahan, tiniharule 53 warshe Saroja Balasubramanian co shab ragatko dag lageko kamballe dhakieko bhettae."" This translates to: ""Officials were directed to her caller's dark-colored Oldsmobile Intrigue, 500 feet away. There, they found 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramanian's body covered in a blood-stained blanket.""

Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian's body was found in the trunk of a car.



"
ee-bele ke prapta garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: skype**.

Here's why:

* **P (the prompt) describes Skype.** The prompt states ""Yo ee-beco itihasma sabaibhanda thulo adhigrahan ho"" (This acquisition is the biggest in tech history).  It also mentions expanding into areas where Skype has a strong presence (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil).  The goal is to diversify revenue streams, which is exactly what Microsoft did with Skype.
* **Microsoft acquired Skype.**  The prompt is *about* the acquisition *of* a company. Microsoft was the acquirer.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **Apple:**  Apple hasn't been acquired.
    * **Microsoft:** Microsoft is the *buyer* in this scenario, not the thing being bought.
    * **Zoom:** Zoom became popular *after* the Skype acquisition, and wasn't involved.



"
yo adhigrahanbata ee-bele ke khojiraheko cha?,"Correct answer is **C: yesko profile badhaunu** (to enhance its profile).

Here's why:

The passage states the acquisition is significant for EE-beco, allowing it to diversify revenue streams and gain popularity in growing markets like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This clearly indicates EE-beco is looking to *expand its overall profile* and market reach.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: yesko rajaswa jamma garnu** (to accumulate its revenue): While increased revenue is a result, it's not the *primary* goal mentioned. Diversification is the means, not the end.
*   **B: naya kshetraharuma failanu** (to succeed in new areas): Success is *hoped for*, but the acquisition is about *entering* those areas, not guaranteed success.
*   **D: yesko sharehsajhedarharulai santusta parna** (to satisfy its shareholders): While shareholder satisfaction is always important, the passage focuses on strategic growth and market expansion, not direct shareholder benefit.



"
"anuchhed anusar, yuddha-pachi parisarma rahane bandiharusita kasle kurakani garena?","The correct answer is **A: Madhyastakartaharu (Mediators)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Madhyastakartaharule awasthalai sudhar garna khoje, tar kaidiharuka magharu spashta chhainan."" This translates to ""Mediators tried to find ways to improve the situation, but the demands of the prisoners were not clear."" This implies the mediators attempted to communicate with the prisoners but didn't understand what they wanted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Agalagi bachao dalle (Fire rescue team):** They were involved in *suppressing* the fire, not neglecting the prisoners.
*   **C: adhikariharu (Officers):** Officers used tear gas, actively intervening, so they didn't neglect the prisoners.
*   **D: aspatalko karmachari (Hospital staff):** The passage mentions hospital staff receiving injured prisoners *after* the war, they were not involved in the prison situation itself.



"
nimna madhey akhirkaar keley garda bandiharu danga garnabata pachi sare?,"The correct answer is **B: ashru gas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Danga poshaksahit susajjit adhikari yardma praesh gare ra bandiharulai **ashru gasle ghera hale**."" (Officials in riot gear entered the yard and surrounded the prisoners with **tear gas**.)

This directly explains what finally caused the riot to be brought under control. The other options are either causes *of* the riot (D: aglagi - fire) or don't relate to the ending of the riot (A: safal vaarta - successful news, C: ghaitey bhayeka sahakarmi bandiharu - injured cooperating prisoners).



"
"ayatola ally khamaneiko vicharmaa, iran deshley afulai kebata mukta garaunu pardacha?","The correct answer is **D: telma nirbharta (dependence on oil)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described Iran's oil production as ""a trap"" that began with the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and that the country needed to free itself from. This directly implies he believes Iran needs to break free from its **dependence on oil**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wittiya pratibandha (financial sanctions):** While the passage mentions financial sanctions, Khamenei's comment isn't *about* needing freedom *from* the sanctions, but from the source of revenue the sanctions target (oil).
* **B: islamic kranti (Islamic Revolution):** The revolution is presented as the *start* of the problem (the ""trap""), not what Iran needs to free itself from.
* **C: vaidashik amdani (foreign income):** While oil provides foreign income, the core issue is the *reliance* on that income, not income itself.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kasley iranko arthatantrama pratibandhako asarharu swikar garyo?","The correct answer is **A: warishtha sutraharu (senior sources)**.

The passage states: ""Tiniharule kachcha telko niryatma europeli uniondwara wittiya nishedhan ra pratibandha samawesh garchhan, jasbata irani arthatantrale yasako videshi amdaniko 80% prapta gardacha.""  This translates to ""They acknowledge the financial sanctions and embargoes on crude oil exports by the European Union, from which the Iranian economy receives 80% of its foreign income.""  The ""tiniharu"" (they) refers to ""warishtha irani sutraharule"" (senior Iranian sources) mentioned earlier in the sentence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC:** OPEC reported a decline in oil exports, but didn't *acknowledge the impact of sanctions*.
* **C: Ayatola Ali Khamenei:** He *described* the situation but didn't *acknowledge the impact of sanctions*. He warned about it being a ""trap"".
* **D: Europeli Sangh (European Union):** The EU *imposed* the sanctions, they didn’t *acknowledge their impact on the Iranian economy* – the Iranian sources did.



"
nimna madhey kun franceko matadan prakriyako bhag hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: ummedwarharuko pratinidhidwara matadanharu ganana hune (counting voters by representatives of candidates)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that volunteers count the votes under strict supervision. It doesn't mention candidates' representatives doing the counting. It specifically says only authorized poll workers do the counting.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the French voting process:

*   **A: pardarshi matadan petikaharu (transparent ballot boxes):** The text explicitly says ballot boxes must be transparent.
*   **B: ummedwarharule pathayeka pratinidhiharu (representatives sent by candidates):**  The passage states candidates *can* send representatives to oversee the process.
*   **C: matadan suchima hastakshar garne (signing the voter list):** The passage directly mentions voters signing the voter list after their identity is verified.



"
matadatale uniharule chayan gariyeka ummedwarlai kaha ankit garchhan?,"The correct answer is **B: purva-print garieko kagajma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""matadataharu boothma eklai janchhan, afno chhanautako ummedwar janaune purva-print garieko kagajko panalai khamma halchhan."" This translates to: ""Voters go to the booth alone and mark the name of their chosen candidate on a pre-printed paper ballot.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: matadan suchima (voter list)** - The voter list is for identification, not for marking a choice.
*   **C: euta khamma (a box)** - While ballots are *placed* in boxes, they don't mark their choice *on* the box.
*   **D: boothbhitrako machinema (machine inside the booth)** - The text doesn't mention any machines being used for marking choices.



"
allenlai musasiko aath-barsha khoj suru garna kun kurale prerit garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: unko samudri anweshanma lagani** (his investment in marine exploration).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kathit rupma afno dheraijaso dhan samudri anweshanma lagani gare ra yudhama jiwanparyantako ichchhapachi musasi fella parney afno khoj suru gare."" This translates to ""...in a way, he invested a lot of his wealth in marine exploration and started his search to find the Musashi, fulfilling a lifelong wish after the war.""

This directly links Allen's significant investment in marine exploration as the driving force behind starting the eight-year search for the Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: unko dhan** (his wealth) - While he *used* his wealth, the wealth itself didn't *inspire* the search. It was the *investment* of that wealth in marine exploration.
*   **B: unko seabed mapping ma ruchi** (his interest in seabed mapping) - Seabed mapping was a *tool* used *during* the search (with ROV), not the initial motivation.
*   **D: yuddhama unko ruchi** (his interest in war) - The passage mentions his wish fulfilled *after* the war, but doesn't state his interest in war motivated the search.



"
"anuchhed anusar, allenley unko dheraijaso dhan kema kharcha garyo?","The correct answer is **B: samudri anweshan** (ocean exploration).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...alenle kathit rupma afno dheraijaso dhan samudri anweshanma lagani gare..."" which directly translates to ""...Allen invested a large part of his wealth in ocean exploration...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: musai ko punarnirman garna** (to rebuild the musai) - While Allen *wanted* to find the Musasi and potentially rebuild it, the passage doesn't say he spent his wealth *on rebuilding*.
*   **C: rov nirman garna** (to build ROVs) - ROVs were *used* in the exploration, but the passage doesn't state the wealth was spent on building them.
*   **D: seabed mappingbarey sikna** (to learn seabed mapping) - Seabed mapping was a *method* used, not the primary thing the money was spent on.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kura plantbhitra ra warpar khatarapurna awasthako karan thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: uranium indhan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that officials suspect the release of radioactive caesium and iodine *could be* due to leaking containers of **uranium fuel**. This suggests the uranium fuel is the potential source of the danger, making it the reason for the hazardous conditions at the plant and around it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: radiodharmi caesium:** While caesium is radioactive and dangerous, it's a *result* of the problem, not the cause.
*   **C: seto dhuwaan:** The white smoke is a *symptom* of the problem, not the underlying cause of the danger.
*   **D: iodine:** Similar to caesium, iodine is a radioactive substance released, but not the source of the problem.



"
plantko ghatana pachi nimna madhey kun kura sthaniya basindaharulai sujhav gariyeko suraksha sallahaharu hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: seto dhuwa swash bhitra linabata jogina** (avoiding breathing in the white smoke).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the following safety advice was given to locals:**
    * Biruwa warparka basindaharulai gharbhitra rahan (stay indoors)
    * watanukulan band garna (turn off air conditioning)
    * nalaka pani napiuna (do not drink tap water)

* **Option C (avoiding breathing in the white smoke)** is a logical safety precaution given the situation (a plant releasing smoke potentially containing radioactive material), but it's **not explicitly mentioned** as advice given *by the authorities* in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct advice from the passage:

* **A: watanukulan ekai prayog nagarna** (do not use air conditioning) - This is directly stated.
* **B: bhitra basna** (stay indoors) - This is directly stated.
* **D: dharako pani napiuna** (do not drink tap water) - This is directly stated.



"
"dr. mollko anusar, xdr-tb sambandhi sabaibhanda chintajank kura kun ho?","The correct answer is **D: yesko uccha mrityu dar** (its high mortality rate).

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Dr. Moll as saying the new strain was """"""dherai uccha mrityu darka karan dherai uccha chintajanak ra darlagdo thiyo"""""" (very concerning and frightening because of its very high mortality rate). This makes the high mortality rate the most concerning aspect according to Dr. Moll.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: aspatalbata sanskaran sarney** (spread of infection from the hospital) - While hospital spread is mentioned, it's presented as a *potential* consequence, not the primary concern.
*   **B: sanskaran ko ausadhipratiko pratirodh** (the infection's resistance to medication) -  The passage states it's *XDR-TB* (Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis), indicating resistance is a defining feature, but the *result* of that resistance – the high death rate – is what Dr. Moll highlights as most alarming.
*   **C: euta sankramit wyaktiley sankraman sarna sakney manisharuko matra** (the number of people one infected person can infect) -  The passage mentions 10-15 contacts, but doesn't frame this as the biggest concern. It's a factor in spread, but not the core issue.



"
naya sanskaran bata sankramit bhaeka biramiharu madhey kati jana swasthyakarmi bhayeka pusti vayo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""...kamtima duijana aspatalka swasthyakarmi thee."" which translates to ""...at least two hospital health workers were there."" This confirms that at least two health workers were infected.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
nextgen pranalile kasto prakarko prawidhi prayog garcha?,"The correct answer is **A: upgrahama-adharit prawidhi** (satellite-based technology).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that NextGen replaces ""purano bhumi-radar-adharit praidhiko"" (old land-radar-based technology) with ""bhuupgraha-adharit praidhiko"" (ground-satellite-based technology).  This means NextGen utilizes satellite technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: parisuddhata prawidhi** (purity technology) - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: bhumi-radar-adharit prawidhi** (land-radar-based technology) - The passage says NextGen *replaces* this, it doesn't *use* it.
*   **D: carbon utsarjanharu prawidhi** (carbon emission technologies) - While NextGen helps *reduce* carbon emissions, it doesn't *use* a technology specifically *for* carbon emissions. Its core change is the technology it employs for navigation.



"
nextgenley kasari vayu traffic niyantrakharulai sidhai faida gardacha?,"The correct answer is **A: vimanharu ko chhoto udan marga** (shorter flight paths).

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen helps planes fly shorter routes. This directly benefits air traffic controllers by allowing them to manage traffic more efficiently. The other options are benefits *of* the shorter routes (less fuel, reduced emissions), but not how NextGen directly aids controllers.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: thap hawaiviman sthanharu** (accurate aircraft locations) - While NextGen *provides* this, it's a result of the technology, not the direct way it helps controllers.
* **C: carbon utsarjanma katauti** (reduction in carbon emissions) - This is a positive outcome, but not how NextGen directly assists controllers.
* **D: kam indhan** (less fuel) -  Again, a benefit, but not the direct assistance to controllers.



"
"anuchhedko anusar, itihaskarharule fbilai ke ma kendrit bhaeko karan alochana gareka chainan?","Correct answer is **C: ashillataka muddharuma dherai kendrit bhaera**.

Here's why:

The passage states that historians criticized the FBI for focusing on obscenity cases (""ashlilata pahallai"") and dedicating 10 agents to it. This means the historians didn't criticize the FBI for *increasing* its success rate, focusing on easily solvable cases, or car thefts – they criticized it for prioritizing obscenity investigations.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uniharuko safaltako dar badhaunu** - The passage doesn't state the historians were concerned about the FBI’s success rate.
*   **B: sajilaisanga samadhan hune aparadhharuma srotharu kendrit garnu** - While the passage mentions easily solvable cases, it doesn't say the historians criticized the FBI for focusing on them.
*   **D: car choriko muddaharu** - The passage mentions car thefts but states the historians focused their criticism on the FBI’s attention to obscenity.



"
fbi lai ashlilata pahal le ke garna badhya garcha?,"The correct answer is **D: ashillataka muddaharuma agentharu samarpit garcha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Congressle wittiya 2005 maa ashlilata pahallai wittiya poshan garna suru garyo ra FBIlai 10 agent wayaska ashlilataka lagi chhutyaunu parchha bhanera nirdishta garyo.""  This directly translates to ""Congress began funding pornography research in 2005 and specified that the FBI must assign 10 agents to work on pornography.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: car choriko muddaharuma thap srot kendrit garcha** - The passage mentions car theft but doesn’t say the FBI's focus shifted *to* it.
*   **B: karyalayako safaltako dar badhaucha** - While the passage mentions agency success, it's not a direct result of the pornography assignment.
*   **C: sajilaisanga samadhan nahune apradhharuma kendrit garcha** - The passage doesn't relate to the difficulty of solving crimes.



"
jas 39c gripen durghatnako pratikriya garne agni niyantrak sawarilai ke bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **B: tyo paltiyo** (they overturned).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sthaniya mediale pratikriyako kramama wimansthalko agni niyantrak sawari paltieko suchana diyo."" This translates to ""Local media reported that the fire control vehicle at the airfield had overturned.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tesko durghatna bhayo** (they had an accident) - While there was an overall incident, the text specifically mentions *overturning*.
*   **C: tyo wisfot bhayo** (they exploded) - The text says the Gripen *exploded*, not the fire control vehicle.
*   **D: tesko indhan sakiyo** (their fuel leaked) - The text does not mention anything about fuel leakage.



"
"jas 39c gripen durghatna bhayepachi, wimansthal keko lagi banda gariyo?","The correct answer is **A: wyawasayik udanharu** (commercial flights).

The text states: ""...jasle garda wimansthalle wyawasayik udanharu band gareko thiyo."" (which caused commercial flights at the airfield to be suspended).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: agni niyantrak sawariharu** (fire control riders) - The text says they *reported* the fire was under control, they didn't cause the closure.
* **C: sthaniya media** (local media) - They reported on the event, they didn't close the airfield.
* **D: squadron netaharu** (squadron leaders) - They identified the pilot, they didn't close the airfield.



"
iranko krantiko samayma brajejinskile kaslai margadarshanko prastaw gare?,"The correct answer is **C: carter**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""irani kranti, jasle iran bandhakko sankat sirjana garyo, 1979."" and earlier mentions Zbigniew Brzezinski advising Jimmy Carter on foreign policy and then serving as National Security Advisor to Carter during that time. Therefore, Brzezinski would have been advising **Carter** during the Iranian Revolution.



"
1977 samma rashtriya suraksha sallaharko pad kasley samhalyo?,"The correct answer is **B: kissinger**.

The text states: ""heinry kisingarpachi 1977 dekhi 1981 samma rashtriya suraksha sallahakar (NSA) ko rupma sewa gare."" (Henry Kissinger served as the National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981.)

Arū options sahi hun:

*   **A: unle afno toliko lagi 468 goalharu gare** - text-ma bhnna sakinchha.

partijan belgradesangako bobekko itihasbarey kun kathan satya ho?,"The correct answer is **A: unle partijanko lagi 1945 dekhi khelna suru gare** (He started playing for Partizan in 1945).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Uhaan tiniharusanga sun 1945 maa samel hunubhayo ra uhaan sun 1958 samma basnubhayo."" (He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.) This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: partijan belgradema khelna aghi uni jagrebko lagi khelthe** (Before playing for Partizan Belgrade, he played for Zagreb) - The text says he *was born* in Zagreb, but doesn't mention playing for a club there.
* **C: unle partijanko lagi 1995 samma khele** (He played for Partizan until 1995) - He played until 1958, as stated in the text. He was *voted* the best player in 1995, not playing then.
* **D: partijanko sarwashreshtha kheladi chuniyepachi unle prasiddhi kamaye** (He gained fame after being chosen as Partizan's best player) - He was already famous *because* of his playing record (403 goals in 468 appearances). Being voted best player confirmed his existing fame.

"anuchhed anusar, kun viseshtaley Hesperonicuslai bhelosireptarbata chuttaucha?","The correct answer is **B: tesko jhan thulo doshro nangra cha** (its second claw was larger).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yasako dosro panja jhanai thulo thiyo, jasle hesperonicus namko udaya bhayo jasko earth """"paschimi panja"""" ho."" which translates to ""Its second claw was particularly large, which gave rise to the name Hesperonicus meaning ""western claw"".""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tesko duita khutta cha** (it has two legs) - While the text mentions it walks on two legs, this is a characteristic shared with *Velociraptor* and doesn't *distinguish* Hesperonicus.
* **C: tesko juibhari pwakh cha** (it has feathered wings) - The text doesn't mention anything about wings or feathers.
* **D: tesko tato ragat cha** (it is warm-blooded) - The text only states it was a ""tato ragat bhaeko shikari chara"" (warm-blooded predatory animal) but doesn't make this a distinguishing feature.



"
“Hesperonicus” ko artha tyo prajatiko kun sharirik viseshtabata utpanna gariyeko ho?,"The correct answer is **A: nangra(haru)** (claws).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Hesperonicus namko udaya bhayo jasko earth """"paschimi panja"""" ho."" which translates to ""...the name Hesperonicus came about because of its earth """"western claw""""."" This clearly indicates the name is derived from a distinctive feature of its claws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: pwakhley bhariyeko sharir (feathered body):** The passage doesn't mention feathers.
*   **C: khuttaharu (legs):** While it mentions walking on two legs, the name isn't based on its legs in general.
*   **D: chucho (beak):** The passage doesn't mention a beak.



"
nimna madhey golibari sambandhi kun kathan satya ho?,"The correct answer is **D: golibari buffaloma bhayeko thiyo** (The shooting happened in Buffalo).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bafeloma janmeka 30 warshe pati golibarima marieka charmadhye ek thee"" which translates to ""During a birthday celebration of 30 years, the husband was injured in a shooting in Buffalo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pati ra patni dubai texasbata thiye** (The husband and wife were from Dubai, Texas) - The text states they were in Texas for their anniversary, but doesn't mention their origin as Dubai.
*   **B: tyaha panch piditharu thiye** (There were five victims) - The text only mentions the husband being injured, and the wife being unharmed.
*   **C: ek warsha aghi dampattiko buffaloma bihe bhaeko thiyo** (The couple got married in Buffalo a year ago) - The text states they got married a year ago in Texas, not Buffalo.



"
nimna madhey golibari ghatana sambandhi bhayeko thaubare kun kathan thik cha?,"The correct answer is **A: tyo buffaloma warshikotsawa ko bhojma bhayeko thiyo** (It happened at the anniversary party in Buffalo).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bafeloma janmeka 30 warshe pati golibarima marieka charmadhye ek thee"" which translates to ""One of the 30-year-old guests at the Buffalo party was shot during a shooting.""  This clearly places the shooting incident at the anniversary party held in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tyo aupacharik warshikotsawa ko karyakram ma bhayeko thiyo** (It happened at the formal anniversary program) - The text says officials *inspected* a designated area, not that the shooting happened *at* the formal program itself.
* **C: texasko bhojma bhayeko thiyo** (It happened at the Texas party) - The couple had been married for a year *in* Texas, but the party described where the shooting occurred was in Buffalo.
* **D: tyo dampattiko bihema bhayeko thiyo** (It happened at the couple's wedding) - The shooting happened at their anniversary party, not their wedding.



"
"anuchhed anusar, adhikariharu lai luno ko bare suruwati chinta ke thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: mal cargo ko kami**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""suruma adhikariharu jahajle kehi bhar pokhna sakha bhani daraye."" This translates to ""Initially, officials were worried that the ship might not be able to handle some load."" This directly indicates their initial concern was about the ship's cargo capacity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: chhalharu ra uccha aandhi:** While the passage mentions storms and fog, it doesn't say these were the *initial* concerns of the officials. They are events that happened *after* the initial worry about cargo.
*   **C: indhanko chuwahat:** The passage mentions fuel (indhan), but not any concern about its supply.
*   **D: dalka sadasyaharulai huna sakney sambhawit chotpatakharu:** Concern for the crew came after the incident, not as the initial worry.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey lunoko kharabibare kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **B: kharabi huda jahajma 100 metersko indhan thiyo** (The damage had 100 meters of fuel in the ship).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the ship had 120-160 *ghanmeter* of fuel, not 100 meters.**  *Ghanmeter* is a unit of volume, while meters simply measure length. This is a misinterpretation of the information.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

* **A: kharabi cargo uthauna aghi bhayeko thiyo** (The damage was ahead of loading cargo) - The passage states the 100-meter ship was traveling for its regular owner's cargo link, implying it hadn't loaded cargo yet.
* **C: baarha jana dal ka sadasyaharu madhey, ekjanalai chotpatak lagyo** (Among the twelve team members, one person was slightly injured) - The passage explicitly states, ""ek matra chotpatak futeko naak thiyo"" (only a slightly broken nose).
* **D: jahajlai bandhama dhakalieko thiyo** (The ship was covered in rubble) - The passage states, ""uccha aandhi ra chhalle yasalai bandhama dhakelyo"" (strong winds and debris covered it in rubble).



"

The text states: ""Sun 1960 ko dashakma uni ferry nav-swatantra algeriama farkieka thee..."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he went to newly independent Algeria..."". This directly indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.



"
antyeshti samharoko lagi kaha television screenharu sthapana gariyeko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **D: cent peters square ma**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Upasthit mancheharuko sankhya thulo bhaera sabailai cent peters squirema antyeshtima jaan sambhawa thiena."" (Because the number of people present was large, it was possible for everyone to see the funeral on Cent Peter's Square).

While television screens were also set up in other cities (Italy and Poland), the passage highlights Cent Peter's Square as the main location for viewing the funeral."
antyeshti samharo kaha gariyo?,"The correct answer is **C: cent peters square ma**.

The text explicitly states: ""...sabailai cent peters squirema antyeshtima jaan sambhawa thiena"" which translates to ""...it was possible for everyone to see the funeral in St. Peter's Square.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: romebhariko vibhinna sthanharuma** (in different places in Rome) - While gatherings happened *to watch* the funeral in different places, the funeral itself was centered in St. Peter's Square.
*   **B: polandma** (in Poland) - Poland had viewing setups, but the funeral didn't *take place* there.
*   **D: pahila romema tyaspachi italyko arko saharma** (first in Rome and then in another city in Italy) - The text doesn't mention the funeral moving to another Italian city.



"
"wisfotan bhae pachhi, gambhir chotpatakko lagi kaslai upachar gariyo?","The correct answer is **A: kamsekam paanch jana manis** (at least five people).

The text states: ""...wisfotka samayama kamtima paanch jana wyaktima aghatko lakshan dekhiekale tinko upchar garieko thiyo."" This translates to ""...at least five people showed signs of injury during the explosion and three were treated.""

Therefore, at least five people received treatment for injuries.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chhimekile gyaans chuhieko barema phone garepachhi **gyaans companyka ek adhikarile** ghatanasthalma khabar gariraheka thee."" (After the neighbors reported the gas leak, **an official from the gas company** was dispatched to the scene.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bhawanko ek chimeki** (a neighbor of the building) - The neighbor *reported* the leak, they didn't *report* it themselves.
* **B: apartmentma basiraheko wyakti** (a person living in the apartment) - The text states the apartment was empty.
* **D: bhawan ko prabandhak** (the building manager) - The text doesn't mention the building manager reporting anything.



"
"anuchhed anusar, akrmanma kati jana manis mariye?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Panchaun wyaktiko taukoma nishana lagaune kramama ukako hatiyarle cam garena."" This translates to ""The weapon did not target five people."" This implies that five people were *intended* targets, and thus, likely the number of people who died in the attack.

Therefore, the answer is 5."
akramanko dauran kunai samayma kasko hatiyarley kam garena?,"The correct answer is **B: uka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Panchaun wyaktiko taukoma nishana lagaune kramama ukako hatiyarle cam garena."" (""During the attack, the weapon didn't fire in the sequence of aiming at fifty people."") ""Uka"" refers to the attacker, and the sentence directly states their weapon malfunctioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kadabyak:** The text says Kadabyak was the driver, not involved in firing a weapon.
*   **C: Snider:** Snider was the victim who needed surgery.
*   **D: Alden:** Alden is another individual mentioned, but there's no information about them and a weapon.



"
nimna madhey kun khellai olympic karyakrambata hataiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: squash**.

Here's why:

The text states that baseball, softball, squash, karate, and roller sports all *tried* to get into the Olympics. It then says rugby (union specifically) was chosen along with those other sports for potential inclusion. The text doesn't mention squash being ultimately selected, implying it was not chosen for inclusion. The question asks which sport was *removed* from the program, and since squash didn't make the cut, it's the most logical answer.



"
nimna madhey kun khellai antarrashtriya olympic samitile khelharuma smawesh garne matadan garey?,"The correct answer is **C: rugby sangh** (rugby union).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""rugby, vishesh gari rugby union ra gulf olympicma sahabhagi lynn manine paanch any khelka rupma chhanieka thee."" This translates to: ""rugby, especially rugby union, was among five sports vying for participation in the Gulf Olympics.""  It also states the Berlin executive board meeting voted on including sports in the Olympics, and rugby was one of those considered.

While baseball, softball, squash, karate, and roller sports were also mentioned as being considered, the question asks which sport the IOC *voted* on including. The text clearly states rugby union was among them.



"
arthur guinessley st. james gate brewery kati barshako lagi bhadama liye?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

Here's why:

The text states ""250 warshapachhi, ginij ek vishwawyapi wyawasayama wiksit bhaeko cha..."" which translates to ""250 years later, Guinness developed into a global business..."". This directly answers the question of how many years it took Arthur Guinness to build the St. James Gate Brewery into what it became.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 10** - This refers to the 10 billion euro annual turnover, not the years to build the business.
* **C: 1759** - This is the *start* date, not the length of time.
* **D: 9000** - This refers to the initial rent paid, not the time it took to develop the business.



"
harek barsha guinessley lagbhag kati billion dalar kamaucha?,"The passage states Guinness makes over 10 billion euro (US$14.7 billion) in business *each year*.  The question asks for the amount in *billions of dollars*. The passage directly gives us US$14.7 billion, which rounds down to 14 billion.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 14**.
"
europeli sanghko katiwata rashtrama h5n1 virusko pahichan bhaeko cha?,"The correct answer is **C: saat**.

Here's why:

The text states that after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, France is the *seventh* European Union country affected by the virus.  Therefore, H5N1 has been identified in 7 EU nations.



"
h5n1 virusko antimpatak pushti kaha bhaeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: france**.

The text states: ""Manawama ghatak bird flue roko prajati H5N1 ley sombar franceko purvama leone najikai marcellandma fella pareko ek mrit jungli haansalai sankramit gareko pushti bhaeko cha."" This translates to: ""The deadly bird flu strain H5N1 was confirmed to have infected a dead wild duck found near Marcelland in the east of France on Monday.""

Therefore, the outbreak was first confirmed in France."
shanti senaharule rog sarna aghi haiti ma yo rogko sankraman antim palta kahile bhaeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: senaharu aunu kehi samay aghi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Senako agaman hunuaghi, haitile sun 1800 co dashakpachhi yo rogsanga sambandhit samasyaharuko samana garnupareko thiena."" This translates to ""Before the arrival of the army, Haiti had not faced problems related to this disease since the 1800s.""

This directly indicates the disease transmission ended sometime *before* the peacekeepers arrived.



"
kun sthanko phohorley rog sarnama yogdaan garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: artibonite nadi**.

Here's why:

The text states the disease outbreak started near the UN peacekeepers' military camp *and* is linked to a problem Haiti hadn't faced since the 1800s. The implication (and subsequent investigation) points to the source being the Artibonite River.  While the UN camp is involved in the *spread* of the disease (the accusation), the river is the origin point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sanyukta rashtra sanghko chaauni (United Nations headquarters):** The text refers to the camp of UN peacekeepers, not the overall UN headquarters.
* **C: 2010ko bhukampako sthan (location of the 2010 earthquake):** The earthquake is mentioned as a background event, but not as the source of the disease.
* **D: Hytian nyaya tatha prajatantra sanstha (Haitian Justice and Democracy Institute):** This organization *investigated* the outbreak, but didn't cause it.



"
iris sarkarle ke garney yojana gardai cha?,"The correct answer is **A: laghuaausadh sambandhi apradhiharulai karwahi garne** (To prosecute those involved in illicit drugs).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iris sarkarle afno paristhiti sudharna sansadiya kanuna banaunu parne kurama jode dindaichha... ahileka asanwaidhanik pariwartanharu lago bhaedekhi laguaushadha sambandhi karwahi hastantaranka lagi chinta wyakta gare.""  This translates to: ""The Iris government has pledged to create parliamentary laws to improve its situation...expressing concern about the transfer of proceedings related to drug offenses in light of existing constitutional changes.""

This clearly indicates the government plans to take action *against* those dealing with illicit drugs - meaning *prosecute them*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: laghuausadhko anumati maa thap kada kanun bhitryaune** (Establishing a framework for regulating drugs): The text doesn't mention regulating drugs, only prosecuting offenses.
* **C: laghuausadhko anumati sambandhi kanunharu khukulo parne** (Loosening laws related to drug permits): The text implies stricter enforcement, not loosening.
* **D: laghuausadhlai gairapradhikaarn garne** (To decriminalize drugs): Again, the emphasis is on prosecution, not decriminalization.



"
irelandma ke asthai rupma vaidh thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: laghuausadh (minor drugs)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Swasthya mantrile samawesh bhaeka padarthako asthayi waidhaniktako faida liiraheka wyaktiharuko bhalaika lagi..."" which translates to ""The Health Minister expressed concern regarding the transfer of legal benefits of substances included in temporary legislation...""  This clearly refers to substances that were temporarily legal. The context of the entire passage points towards discussions about drug-related actions, making ""laghuausadh"" (minor drugs) the most logical fit.

The other options don't fit the context:

*   **Dakaiti (robbery):** This is a crime, not something that would be temporarily legalized.
*   **Jalsaji (adultery):** While potentially illegal, it's not directly related to the legislative concerns mentioned.
*   **Kutpit (assault):** Like robbery, this is a crime.



"
sankha gariyeko apradhilai keko lagi anusandhan garindai cha?,"The correct answer is **C: todfod (vandalism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Los Angeles prahari vibhagka praakta Christopher Garciale bhane key shankaspad purush aparadhilai **tofdod garnuko satta aparadh gareko bhaera** anusandhan bhairaheko cha."" (The Los Angeles police department's officer Christopher Garcia is investigating a suspect man for committing a crime **instead of vandalism**.)

The passage directly links the investigation to a crime *instead* of vandalism, meaning the suspect is accused of committing a more serious crime, but was *thought* to be committing vandalism. Therefore, the initial suspicion was about vandalism (tofdod).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: anadhikarik prawesh (unauthorized entry):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about unauthorized entry.
* **B: bhautik kshati (physical damage):** While there's mention of physical harm to signs, the primary focus of the investigation isn't solely *physical damage*.  The altered signs are part of the *method* of the crime, not the crime itself (at least in the initial suspicion).
* **D: chori (theft):** There's no mention of theft in the passage.



"
chinahalai parimarjan garda doshiley ke garena?,"The correct answer is **C: bhautik roopma kshati** (physical damage).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chinhalai bhautik rupma kshati purryaieko thiena"" which translates to ""No physical damage was done to the sign.""  This directly answers the question of what wasn't done during the alteration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tesko euta akshar pariwartan** (a letter change) - The passage *does* mention a letter change (""O"" to ""e"").
* **B: teslai shantiko chinhale sajayo** (decorated with peace symbols) - The passage *does* mention peace symbols were used.
* **D: teslai parimarjan garna tarpaulinsko prayog** (used tarpaulins to alter) - The passage mentions ""callo kapda"" (cloth) was used, not tarpaulins.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey keko lagi angreji shikshaklai dosh lagaena?","The correct answer is **D: kakshamaa ashlil bhasha prayog garne** (using obscene language in the classroom).

The passage states: ""Unko notema unle kehi abhibhawakharu asabhya mane gareka shabdaharuko prayog garthe ra uni kakshama ashlilta prayog garthe bhane suninchha."" This translates to: ""Some parents have heard that he uses abusive words in his notes and that he uses obscenity in the classroom.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pratilipi adhikar ullanghan** (Copyright infringement) - While mentioned, it's stated the case was dismissed (""mudda darta garieko thiena"").
* **B: vidyarthisanga dating** (Dating students) - The passage states he ""was like a friend to the students,"" which is different from dating.
* **C: bina anumati vigyapanharu chhapne** (Printing advertisements without permission) - This is a separate accusation, but the main focus of the complaints is his behavior in the classroom.



"
"anuchhed anusar, ronaldo mendozad le kaslai bandhakko rupma rakhenan?","Correct answer is **A: paryatakharu**.

The text clearly states ""Rolando Mendoza ले पर्यटकहरुमाथि आफ्नो M16 rifle चलायो"" which translates to ""Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists"". This indicates he held tourists hostage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: prahariharu (police)** - The text doesn't say he held police hostage.
*   **C: bachchaharu (children)** - While children *were* among the hostages, the text doesn't say he specifically targeted or only held children.
*   **D: photographerharu (photographers)** - The text mentions photographers *helping* and taking pictures, but not being held hostage.



"
"anuchhedko adharma, kun bandhakharulai chito riha gariyo bhanera pushti gariyena?","The correct answer is **C: photographerharu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bachcha ra wriddha wyaktisahit cha bandhakharulai philipini photographerharulai jastai chhittai riha garie."" This translates to ""The hostages, including children and the elderly, were photographed just like Philippine photographers."" This means the photographers were the ones being photographed (shown/revealed), not releasing the hostages. The text further says the elderly woman needed medical attention and the photographers took her place, meaning they were prioritized for being photographed.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: paryatakharu (tourists):** The text mentions tourists as hostages, but doesn't say they were photographed.
*   **B: vriddha (elderly):** The elderly woman *received* attention after being photographed, she wasn't the focus of being photographed.
*   **D: bachchaharu (children):** The text mentions children as hostages, but doesn't specifically say they were photographed.



"
"anuchhed anusar, brazilma samalingi vivahako samarthanko lagi kasley hastakshararu sankalan gardai chan?","The correct answer is **A: andolankariharu (activists)**.

The passage states: ""Andolankariharule novemberma national congressma dina 112 lakh hastaksharko nivedan sankalan gurney asha rakheka chan."" which translates to ""Activists are hoping to submit a petition with 11.2 million signatures to the national congress in November.""

This clearly indicates that **activists** are collecting the signatures in support of same-sex marriage.



"
andolankariharuley uniharuko nivedan kaslai dinchan?,"The correct answer is **C: Brazilko national congress**.

The text states: ""Andolankariharule novemberma national congressma dina 112 lakh hastaksharko nivedan sankalan gurney asha rakheka chan."" This directly translates to ""Protesters planned to submit a petition with 11.2 lakh signatures to the national congress in November.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: roman catholic church** - The church *opposes* same-sex marriage, they aren't the recipients of the petition.
* **B: roberto jefferson** - Roberto Jefferson is mentioned as someone who *could* sign the bill, not receive the petition.
* **D: São Pauloka meyer** - Marta Suplicy drafted an earlier version of the bill, but the petition is going to the national congress.



"
"Armand Bharsacheko anusar, bhidle mausamko pratikriya garna thik aghi ke bhayo?","The correct answer is **C: tyaha uccha aandhiharu thiye** (there were strong winds).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pradarshanma ek minetma hawa ghumna thalcha, karib ek minetpachhi, hawa 70 kilometer prati ghantasamma pugchha..."" (In the demonstration, the wind started to swirl, after about a minute, the wind reached 70 kilometers per hour...).  This clearly indicates strong winds *before* the rain and chaos described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: asina parna thalyo** (it started to hail) - The passage mentions hail *after* the wind and rain, not before.
*   **B: pradarshan paanch minute dhilo chaliraheko thiyo** (the demonstration had been going on for five minutes) - This is irrelevant to the *reaction* to the changing weather.
*   **D: u praiwarko ek sadasya sanga chutyo** (a member of the group got separated) - The passage details Armand helping people in wheelchairs; there's no mention of someone getting lost.



"
"Bharsache anusar, sabaibbanda baliyo aandhi kahiley suru bhayo?","The correct answer is **A: pradarshan suru hunuaghi kehi minute aghi** (a few minutes before the exhibition started).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pradarshanma ek minetma hawa ghumna thalcha, karib ek minetpachhi, hawa 70 kilometer prati ghantasamma pugchha..."" (A wind started swirling in the exhibition, after about a minute, the wind reached 70 kilometers per hour...).  This clearly indicates the strong wind – the beginning of the storm – *preceded* the exhibition's full start.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pani pachi (after the rain):** The rain came *after* the wind.
* **C: afno bahini sanga chutepacchi (after separating from his sister):**  This refers to a personal experience and isn’t about the storm’s beginning.
* **D: asina parnu aghi (before it started raining):** The hail came after the wind and rain.

"fredbhanda aghi, 35°W ko purvama katiwata mukhya aandhiberi record gariaka thiye?","The text states: ""...35°W ko purvama record garieko tesro thulo toofan ho."" This translates to ""...the third largest storm recorded to the east of 35°W.""

Therefore, there were two storms recorded before Fred.

The correct answer is **C: dui** (two)."
"jaba fred cape verde tapuharuko najik awasthit huda, tyo kun disatira sariraheko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: paschim** (West).

The text states: ""Purwanumankartaharule cape bherde tapuharuko **645 mile (1040 kilometer) paschimma** awasthit yo andhibehari kunai pani kshetralai jokhimma parnuaghi failine sambhawana cha bhanera bhaneka chan."" 

This directly translates to: ""Forecasters have said there is a possibility that this storm will threaten any water area located **1040 kilometers to the west** of the Cape Verde islands.""

Therefore, when Fred was near the Cape Verde islands, it was located to the west."
nimna madhey kunko tesko purvavartiharu bhanda druta gati cha?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that 802.11n has a maximum theoretical speed *greater than* 600 Mbit/s, which is faster than its predecessors (802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g).  The other options are older standards mentioned as being superseded by 802.11n.
"

olympic swarna padak vijetaley rashtramandal khelkudma katiota pratiyogitaharuma paudi khelne thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: teen**.

The passage states: ""Olympic swarna padak vijetale 100 meter ra 200 meter freestyle ra **rashtramandal khelkudma teen rilema paudi khelnu thiyo**..."" which translates to ""The Olympic gold medalist competed in 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle and **three relay races in the Commonwealth Games**""."
olympic swarna padak vijetaley afnp pidako lagi kina ausadhi khairaheko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **A: usanga kunai pida thiyena** (they had some pain).

Here's why:

The passage states the athlete needed medication to free themselves from pain (""unko pidabata mukt hoon awashyak aushadhi lynn sakeka chhainan""). This directly indicates they were taking medication *because* of pain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tesle uuslai birami banauthiyo** (it would make them sick) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the medication making them ill.
* **C: tesle usko swasthatalai nakaratmak ruple asar garcha vanera chintit thiyo** (they were worried it would negatively affect their health) - While possible, the passage focuses on needing the medication for pain relief, not concerns about negative health effects.
* **D: tesko prayog garna rashtramandal khelkudma anumati chaina** (its use isn't permitted in the Commonwealth Games) -  This explains *why* they couldn't take the medication openly (due to competition rules), not *why* they were taking it in the first place.



"
"anuchhed anusar, bhukampa gatiwidhaibare keley bhram srijana garna sakthyo?","The correct answer is **A: kalo badalko upasthiti** (The presence of dark clouds).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Badalle bhramaka lagi sambhawana prastut gare key katai wastawik bisfot bhaeko thiyo"" which translates to ""The clouds presented a possibility of illusion, whether a real explosion had occurred."" This directly links the dark clouds to creating confusion and the *possibility of a false perception* of earthquake activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: icelandic mausam vigyan karyalayako reportharu** (Reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office): The passage says they *didn't* report any activity, so their reports wouldn't *cause* confusion.
* **C: antarrashtriya bhukampa manchiitra** (International Earthquake Monitor): They detected an earthquake, but that's a real detection, not an illusion.
* **D: icelandko aru kshetrama report gariyeko gatiwidhi** (Activity reported in other areas of Iceland):  Activity elsewhere wouldn’t necessarily cause a *false* perception of activity at Heckla.



"
"anuchhed anusar, charan parivartan kahile ghatyo?","The correct answer is **C: march 10 ma**.

The passage states: ""Charan parivartan garaune ullekhaniya bhukampa gatiwidhi **march 10 maa** jwalamukhiko shikhar calderaco uttari chheuma bhaeko thiyo.""  This translates to ""Significant seismic activity causing ground deformation occurred on **March 10th** north of the volcano's summit caldera.""



"
nimna kathanharu madhey chandraayaan-1 ko chandra jaanchbare kun sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: chandra jaanchko ranga lagayeko bhagharu thiyo** (The probe was painted with colors).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that the probe carried the image of the Indian national flag. It doesn't mention anything about the probe *being* painted. The flag was *on* the probe, not *part* of its paint job.

Let's look at why the other options are likely correct based on the passage and general knowledge about Chandrayaan-1:

* **A: chandra jaanch prakshepan gareko orbiterko dal thiyo** (The probe was launched by a team from the orbiter) - This is plausible, as probes are often launched from orbiting spacecraft.
* **B: chandra jaanchma mahatwapurna upakaranharu thiyo** (The probe had important equipment) - The passage specifically mentions ""teen mahatwapurna vaigyanik upakaranharu"" (three important scientific instruments).
* **C: chandra jaanchko nishkashan safal bhayo** (The probe's mission was successful) - While not directly stated, the passage's description of the probe's activities implies a successful mission (carrying instruments, displaying the flag).  Chandrayaan-1 *was* a largely successful mission.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn’t align with the information provided in the passage or general knowledge about the mission."
nimna kathanharu madhey kunley chandra jaanchlai sahi tarikale varnan garcha?,"The correct answer is **D: yesley duita mahatwapurna upakaranharu bokekoo thiyo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Teen mahatwapurna vaigyanik upkaranharu boknu bahek..."" (Besides launching three important scientific instruments...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tyo chandramako uttari dhruv najik awataran garyo** (It landed near the North Pole of the moon) - The passage doesn't mention where on the moon it landed.
* **B: tesko jokhimpurwak awataran safal thiyo** (Its risky landing was successful) - While the mission was significant, the passage mentions a ""chori bhaeko doze"" (stolen dose) and ""mrityu"" (death) implying something went wrong, not a purely successful landing.
* **C: tyo euta manavyukta orbiterbata bahira fyakiyeko thiyo** (It was ejected from a manned orbiter) - The passage doesn't mention anything about a manned orbiter.



Therefore, option D is the only one directly supported by information in the passage."
"anuchhedko adharma, rog viruddha kun surakshako upaya antimma lagu hunecha?","The correct answer is **C: encephalitis khop** (encephalitis vaccine).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sarkardwara encephalitis khopka lakhaun shishiharuko pani pratigya garieko cha, jasle swasthya agencyharulai aundo warshaka lagi tayari garna maddat pugnecha.""  This translates to: ""The government has also pledged encephalitis vaccines for lakhs of children, which will help health agencies prepare for the coming year.""

This clearly indicates the encephalitis vaccine is a key protective measure being implemented against the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kitnashak** (fertilizer) - While mentioned in the context of crop damage, it's not a direct measure against the disease.
* **B: sungur samatneharu** (pig equalizers/controllers) - Controlling pigs is a preventative measure to *reduce the source* of the disease, but not a direct protection for people.
* **D: lamkhutte ko lagi jhulharu** (mosquito nets for the impoverished) -  These are preventative against the *vector* (mosquitoes) but not a direct immunity booster like a vaccine.



"
rog manavma kasari sarcha?,"The correct answer is **A: lamkhutte**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""yo roka wahak hunchhan ra tyasapachhi **yo lamkhutte hundai manawama sarchha**."" This translates to ""this disease spreads and then spreads to humans **through mosquitoes**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kitnashak** -  This means ""insecticide"", which is a *method* to combat the disease, not how it spreads.
* **C: sungurharu** - This means ""pigs"", mentioned as carriers of the disease, but not the direct way it infects humans.
* **D: sungur samatneharu** - This means ""pig farmers"", also related to the spread but not the *method* of transmission.



"
doshro wakyako asafaltale kasto parinaam nimtyauna sakcha?,"The correct answer is **D: samalingi nagarik unionharuko pratibandha (restrictions on same-sex civil unions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dosro wakyako asafalata, jasle samalingi nagarik unionlai pratibandha gurney prastawa gardacha, tyasle bhavishyama nagarik unionka lagi sambhawatah dhoka kholna sakthyo.""

This directly translates to: ""The failure of the second sentence, which proposed to restrict same-sex civil unions, could potentially open the door to danger for civil unions in the future.""

Therefore, the failure of the second sentence (the proposed restriction) means there's a risk of future restrictions being imposed on same-sex civil unions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hjr-3 ko tatkal samikshya (immediate review of HJR-3):** While HJR-3 is mentioned for a future review, the *failure of the second sentence* doesn't immediately trigger that review.
*   **B: bhavishyako lagi samalingi nagarik union ko aadhikar (rights for same-sex civil unions in the future):** The passage suggests the opposite - a *threat* to future rights, not an increase.
*   **C: euta apatkalin vidhayakiya satra (an emergency legislative session):** The passage doesn't indicate an emergency session was called as a result of the failure.



"
"anuchhed anusar, doshro wakya kahiley hataieko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: vidhayakiya satrama** (legislative session).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pratinidhimandalle dosro wakya metaepachhi **vidhayakiya satrama** parivartan gariyo ra sombar sadandwara yastai prakarma parit bhayo."" This translates to: ""The second sentence was changed in the **legislative session** and the matter was carried forward in the same way in the House of Representatives.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 2011 ma** - 2011 is when the first proposal was passed, not when the second sentence was debated.
*   **C: sombaarko din** - While the process continued on Monday, the sentence wasn't *held* on that day, it was *carried forward*.
*   **D: 2015 ma** - 2015/2016 are when a future review is planned, not when the second sentence was acted upon.



"
“panama papers” kaslai pradan garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: mosack fonseka firm**.

The text states: ""panama papers panamiali kanuna firm **mosack fonsekako** karib 10 million kagajatharuka lagi chhata ho..."" (The Panama Papers consist of approximately 10 million documents from the Panamanian law firm **Mossack Fonseca**...).

Therefore, the Panama Papers were provided by the Mossack Fonseca firm.
"
"anuchhed anusar, Britis patrikale kasle dhan lukauna dherai companyharu vyawasthapan gardai thiyo vanera daabi garyo?","The correct answer is **C: duech bank**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Britiš patrika da Garzianka anusar yo karya garnaka lagi prayog garieka 1200 vata sell companyharumadhye ek tihai companyharu duech bankko niyantranma thee."" 

This translates to: ""According to the British newspaper The Guardian, one-third of the 1200 shell companies used for this work were under the control of Deutsche Bank."" 

Therefore, the British newspaper alleges that Deutsche Bank was involved in managing many companies to hide wealth.



"
nimna vimaan durghatanaharu madhey kunma sabaibhanda badhi mrityu vayo?,"The correct answer is **A: iranbata armenia jaandai gareko vimaan durghatana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gat mahina iranle warshaundekhi sabaibhanda darlagdo hawai durghatanako samana gareko cha, armenia jaandai gareko ek vimaan durghatanagrasta bhaeko thiyo ra sawar 168 janako mrityu bhaeko thiyo."" This directly translates to: ""Last month, Iran faced the most horrific air disaster in years, an aircraft crashed while going to Armenia and 168 passengers died.""

The other options have lower death tolls:

*   **B:** Police helicopter - 3 deaths
*   **C:** The text doesn't mention a plane crash *from* Armenia *to* Iran.
*   **D:** Mashhad plane crash - 7 deaths

Therefore, the plane crash going from Iran to Armenia resulted in the highest number of fatalities (168)."
nimna madhey kun iranma hune adhiansha durghatanako karan hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: naya vimaanharu kinnako lagi punjiko kami** (lack of funds to buy new airplanes).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Iran is unable to buy new planes due to international sanctions. This leads to reliance on older aircraft.
* **The passage also mentions:** The fleet is composed of old civil and military aircraft that are poorly equipped. This directly relates to options A and D.
* **The passage directly links sanctions to the inability to purchase new planes (option C).**

However, the passage *doesn't* say there's a lack of funds *in general* to buy new planes, only that sanctions prevent them from doing so.  The issue isn't a lack of money, but a restriction on *spending* that money on aircraft. Therefore, a lack of funds (B) isn't presented as a direct cause of the crashes within the context of the provided text.



"
nimna madhey kun vishaya iraq study groupko reportma smawesh chaina?,"The correct answer is **B: ek ghoshana ki kunai wisesh parivartanharusangai, iraqma himsako bridhi tarna sakinna** (a declaration that no specific changes can guarantee an increase in violence in Iraq).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** The report warns that it *cannot guarantee* preventing sectarian warfare, increased violence, or chaos. It doesn’t make a declaration that specific changes *will* increase violence. It's a cautionary statement about the limits of guarantee, not a prediction of worsening conditions with change.

Let's look at why the other options *are* included in the report:

* **A: haalko nitiko alochana** (criticism of current policy) - The passage states the report ""criticizes almost all aspects of the current policy towards Iraq and urges immediate changes to that policy.""
* **C: iraqko simanaharu surakshit garnako lagi sifaris** (recommendations to secure Iraq's borders) - The passage explicitly mentions the first recommendation: ""secure Iraq's borders against insurgent infiltration and re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.""
* **D: samyukta rajya america ko sarvasammatiko lagi anurodh** (a request for consensus in the United States of America) - The passage says the report ""calls for open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policy.""



"
nimna madhey kun vishaya iraq study groupko reportle agraha gareko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **D: naya kutnitik pahal sthapana garna (establishing new diplomatic initiatives)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Yasaka 78 sifarisharumadhye pahilo yo ho key pratirodhi hastakshepharuko viruddha irakko simana surakshit garna ra yasaka chhimekiharusanga kutnitik sambandhaharu punarsthapana garna yo warshako samaptiaghi naya kutnitik pahalharu garnuparchha."" (The first of its 78 recommendations is to secure Iraq's borders against insurgent interference and to launch new diplomatic initiatives by the end of this year to restore relations with its neighbors.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: badhiraheko himsaa rokne ghosana (declaration to stop ongoing violence):** While the report *warns* about the potential for continued violence, it doesn't *demand a declaration* to stop it. It focuses on preventative measures.
* **B: disama turnattai parivartan (immediate change in direction):** The report calls for a change in policy, but doesn't specify it must be ""immediate"".
* **C: khulla bahashko prayog (use of open discussion):**  The report *requests* open discussion in the US about Middle East policy, but doesn't itself ""use"" or ""demand"" open discussion as a primary recommendation.



"
"prahariko anusar, probhenjanoko dahiney-hat kaslai maninthiyo?","The correct answer is **B: lo piccolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Praharile low pikkoloko mathillo haat raheko cha bhane kinbhane uni palermoma probhenjanoko dahine hatka manis thee...""  This translates to ""Because the guards had Low Piccolo under their control, he was the right-hand man of Probhenzano in Palermo...""

Therefore, according to the guards (prahariharu), Probhenzano's right-hand man was Lo Piccolo.



"
"anuchhedma diyeko jankariko adharma, falconko mrityuko karan ke thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: uni riyaan dwara sanchalit yuddhako samayma mariyeka thiye** (They were killed during the war conducted by the riyan).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...jab samma unle 1992 maa mafia crusaders giovanni falcon ra paolo borselinoko jiwanko dabi gurney rajya viruddha riyanadwara sanchalit yuddhalai antyasamma purryaenan.""  This translates to ""...when they (falcon and borselino) demanded the lives of mafia crusaders giovanni falcon and paolo borselino, ending the war against the state conducted by riyan.""  This directly implies their deaths occurred *during* the war conducted by riyan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: unlai prahariley mareka thiye** (They were killed by the prahari): The text doesn't state the *prahari* (guards) killed them. It mentions prahari being worried about a possible conflict *before* this event.
* **C: low pikkololai unlai marna aadesh diyeko thiyo** (Low Piccolo ordered their deaths): While Low Piccolo is mentioned, the text doesn't link him to ordering the killings of Falcon and Borselino.
* **D: unlai mafia crusader paolo borselinole mareka thiye** (They were killed by mafia crusader Paolo Borselino): This is illogical; Borselino wouldn't kill himself.



"
nimna madhey kun hitoshi saitoko le praapta gareko samman madhey ek hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: duipatak olympic swarna padak vijeta** (two-time Olympic gold medalist).

Here's why:

The passage states Hitoshi Saitoko was an Olympic gold medalist (स्वर्ण पदका विजेता), but it *doesn't* say he won multiple gold medals.  It only mentions he was a former Olympic and world champion.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: duipatakko vishwa champion** (two-time world champion) - The passage states he was a former world champion.
* **B: akhil japan judo federation prashikshan samitika adhyaksha** (All Japan Judo Federation training committee chairman) - The passage explicitly states this was his role at the time of his death.
* **D: judo viseshsagya** (judo expert) -  Being a former Olympic and world champion implies he was a judo expert.



"
iwasakile kaha pratigya garna baata jogina safal bhaye?,"The passage (P) states Iwasaki faced many problems during his journey, including being robbed by sea bandits, attacked by a famous dog in Tibet, arrested in India after marrying in Nepal. 

The question (Q) asks where Iwasaki *successfully* pledged/vowed to travel. This isn't explicitly stated in the passage. However, the beginning of the passage says ""Afno yatrako kramama..."" (During his journey...).  The journey *started* somewhere. While the passage details problems *during* his travels, it doesn't mention where he initially set out *from*.

However, considering the context and the provided options, **A: Japan** is the most logical answer. Iwasaki is a Japanese name, and it's common for journeys to originate from one's home country.  The passage then details his travels *from* that origin to various locations.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Japan**.



"
iwasakilai kasle hamla garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: euta kukur** (a dog).

The passage states: ""Unlai tibbatma ek kukhyat kukurle hamla gareko thiyo"" which translates to ""A famous dog attacked him in Tibet.""

Therefore, a dog attacked Iwasaki.



"
alonsole afno daud kahile samapta gare?,"The correct answer is **C: shumacharle aafno daud samapta gare pachi** (after Schumacher finished his race).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Micheal shumacharle daudaka kramama asankhya ladainharuma nilambanko kshatika karanle garda afno daud Alonsoko kehi samayapachi samapta gare."" This directly translates to: ""Michael Schumacher finished his race some time after Alonso due to damage caused by a collision with numerous racers.""

Therefore, Alonso finished *before* Schumacher. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shumacharle unko agadiko pangra kharab pare pachi** (after Schumacher's front tire was damaged) - This explains *why* Schumacher finished later, but doesn't tell us *when* Alonso finished.
* **B: Fisichelale afno karko niyantran gumae** (Fisichella lost control of his car) - This is about Fisichella, not Alonso.
* **D: daudmaa agrani hunu aghi** (before leading the race) -  Alonso was leading *before* the pit stop, but the question asks when he *finished* the race, not when he was in the lead.



"
ke karanley shumacharle afno daud chito samapta gare?,"The correct answer is **A: unle afno karko niyantran gumae** (He lost control of his car).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Micheal shumacharle daudaka kramama asankhya ladainharuma nilambanko kshatika karanle garda afno daud Alonsoko kehi samayapachi samapta gare."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race some time after Alonso because of a crash while battling in numerous overtaking attempts, losing control of his car.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alonsosangako thakkar** (collision with Alonso) - The text doesn't mention a collision with Alonso being the *cause* of Schumacher's retirement.
*   **C: Fisicheladwara chakkama kshati** (damage to the wheel by Fisichella) - The text discusses Fisichella having issues, but not causing damage to Schumacher's car.
*   **D: karko suspensionma kshati** (damage to the car's suspension) - While there was a crash, the *reason* for the crash given is losing control, not specifically suspension damage.

"anuchhed anusar, pakrau pareka manisharu ko jamanat kasle tokyo?","The correct answer is **A: pakrau gurney adhikari (arresting officer)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yadi swikrit bhaema ayuktale jamanat tokchhan ra **pakrau gurney adhikarile darta gareko aroplai aupacharik banaunchhan**.""  This directly translates to ""If the accepting bail officer sets bail and **the arresting officer formalizes the charges**"". 

Therefore, the arresting officer is the one who sets the bail (tokchhan) for the arrested individuals.



"
"anuchhedma ullekh gariyeko aasthai nirodhak aadesh anusaar, 24 ghantabhanda badhi rakhnakolagi pakrau pareka manisharulai ke rakhna anumati dinuparcha?","The correct answer is **C: nyayadhish glendwara jari gariyeko aupacharik arop (informal charge issued by Judge Glen)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yass warshako aprilma nyayadhish glenle 24 ghantabhanda badhi pakrau pareka wyaktilai riha gare jaslai adalatle kunai sunuwai napaekole riha gareko thiyo."" (This year in April, Judge Glen released people arrested for more than 24 hours who had not had a court hearing. )... ""Yadi swikrit bhaema ayuktale jamanat tokchhan ra pakrau gurney adhikarile darta gareko aroplai aupacharik banaunchhan."" (If the approved bail officer issues bail and the arresting officer makes an informal charge). 

This clearly indicates that an **informal charge issued by Judge Glen** allows someone arrested for more than 24 hours to be released without a hearing. The passage explicitly connects Judge Glen's action to releasing those held beyond 24 hours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jamanat (bail)** - While bail is mentioned, the passage doesn't say *anyone* arrested for over 24 hours is automatically released on bail. It's the informal charge *and* potentially bail that leads to release.
*   **B: pakrau gurney adhikarisanga bhet (meeting with the arresting officer)** - A meeting with the arresting officer isn't mentioned as a condition for release.
*   **D: euta sunuwai (a hearing)** - The passage specifically says those released *hadn't* had a hearing.



"
Anuchhed anusaar raddha garieko runoff laai vyaakhya garnu kun kaaran prayog garieko thiena?,"The correct answer is **A: Suraksha jokhim haru (Security risks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lodinle afaganiharulai arko nirvachanko kharcha ra **suraksha jokhimbata bachaunaka lagi** padadhikariharule nirvachan radd gurney nirnaya gareko pani batae.""  This directly translates to ""The passage also states that officials made the decision to cancel the election **to save Afghans from the cost and security risks** of another election.""

Therefore, security risks were the reason given for cancelling and thus, the reason for the runoff being called off.



"
Kutnitigyaharule antata kina runoff laai anawashyak thaane?,"The correct answer is **C: sanvidhanma aspashtata thiyo** (There was ambiguity in the constitution).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kutnitigyaharule afaganistanko sanvidhanma anawashyak rupma apharan nirdharit garna paryapta aspashtata fella pare bhane."" This directly translates to ""Diplomats felt there was sufficient ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to justify declaring the runoff unnecessary.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yo sanvidhan ko birudd thiyo** (It was against the constitution): The text doesn't say it was *against* the constitution, just that there was ambiguity *within* it.
*   **B: Tyaha surakshya jokhim thiye** (There was a security risk): While the text mentions security concerns related to the election, it doesn't state this was the reason the diplomats found the runoff unnecessary.
*   **D: Nirvachan dherai kharchilo thiyo** (The election was very expensive): The text mentions cost, but doesn't link it to the diplomats' reasoning.



"
FATA kaa laagi nyayik sewaharu kasle pradan garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Rajnitik agentharu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yea agentharu pakistani sanwidhanko dhara 247 antargat sarkari ra nyayik sewaharu pradan garna jimmewar chan."" (These agents are responsible for providing governmental and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pakistani sarkar (Pakistani government):** While the government authorizes it, the *agents* are the ones directly providing the services.
*   **C: Pakistan ko rashtrapati (Pakistan's President):** The President appoints the agents, but they themselves provide the services.
*   **D: British sarkar (British government):** The passage discusses a situation *after* Pakistan's independence from British rule.



"
FATA ko “raajnitik agentharu” sambandhi nimna madhye kun kathan galat cha?,"The correct answer is **C: Uni haru Pakistan sanwidhanko palana gardachan (They follow the Pakistani constitution)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""political agents"" operate *under* Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution, providing governmental and judicial services. However, it also implies they have near-complete control in their areas.  This creates a conflict.  Historically, FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas) operated with a significant degree of autonomy and *outside* the full application of the Pakistani constitution. While Article 247 allows for governance, the reality was a system largely based on traditional tribal laws and the political agent's authority, which often superseded standard constitutional processes.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Uni haru le nyayik sewa pradan garchan (They provide judicial services):** The passage explicitly states they are responsible for providing judicial services.
* **B: Uni haru lai Pakistani sarkar le chayan gareko ho (They are appointed by the Pakistani government):** The passage states the President of Pakistan appoints them.
* **D: Uni haru ko kehi kshetrama purna niyantran cha (They have complete control in some areas):** The passage says they exercise ""near complete control"" (""lagbhag purna swayatta niyantran"") in their areas.



Therefore, the statement that they fully adhere to the Pakistani constitution is the most inaccurate reflection of the historical and practical situation described in the passage."
Emma Stone le kun awardko laagi manonayan prapta garinn?,"The correct answer is **C: sarvotkrishta abhinetri** (Best Actress).

The text states: ""Gosling ra stonele kramashah sarwashreshtha abhineta ra abhinetrika lagi namangkan prapta gare."" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone respectively received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress.""
"
Ukta chalchitra kun awardko laagi manonayan bhaena?,"The correct answer is **A: sarvotkrishta chalchitra (Best Picture)**.

Here's why:

The text states the film received nominations for *many* major categories, including Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Director, etc.  This comprehensive list of nominations strongly suggests it was nominated for the highest honor - Best Picture.  The mention of multiple awards for songs also points toward a film competing for top awards.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: sarvotkrishta Visual Effects (Best Visual Effects):** The text doesn't specifically mention visual effects nominations.
* **C: sarvotkrishta dhwani mishran (Best Sound Mixing):** While it *was* nominated for Sound Mixing, the text emphasizes the breadth of nominations across *many* key categories, indicating a Best Picture contender.
* **D: sarvotkrishta maulik geet (Best Original Song):** While it won awards for its songs, the question asks about the awards the *film* was nominated for, and a Best Song win doesn’t automatically mean it was a Best Picture nominee.



"
Tala ullekh garieka madhya kun chahi bhukampa pachhi sanchalan maa rahe?,"The correct answer is **D: Nigata maa raheko ek urja plant**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nigatako Kashiwajaki kariwa anawik urja kendra samanya rupma sanchalan bhairaheko cha bhanera NHK ley pani report gareko cha."" This directly translates to ""NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata is operating normally.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hokuriku Shika plant kaa sabai reactor haru (All reactors of the Hokuriku Shika plant):** The passage states reactors 1 & 2 *were shut down* at the Shika plant, not that all reactors are operating.
* **B: Ishikawa maa raheko vimansthal (The airport located in Ishikawa):** The passage says the airport in Ishikawa (Noto Airport) is *closed*.
* **C: Sabai railway sewa (All railway services):** The passage says railway services are *disrupted* in the affected areas, not that all services are running.



"
"Anuchhed anusar,tala kaa madhye kesle bhukampa maa kshyati behyore?","The correct answer is **A: Kehi gharharu** (Some houses).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""लगभग 9400 घरहरू पानीबिना..."" (approximately 9400 houses without water...). This directly indicates that houses were affected by the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shika plant kaa dui reactorharu** (Shika plant's two reactors): The reactors were *shut down* as a precaution, not damaged by the earthquake itself.
*   **C: Kehi baato haru** (Some roads): Roads were damaged, but the question asks what suffered *damage* due to the earthquake.
*   **D: Noto vimansthal** (Noto Airport): The airport was *closed*, not damaged.



"
"Annuchhed anusar, tala kaa madhye kun bisaya kagajat maa ullekh gariyeka chainan?","The correct answer is **B: 1967 ko yuddha ko kaaran** (The reason for the 1967 war).

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **Jerusalem ko bhavishya** (The future of Jerusalem) - It explicitly states Jerusalem's future status is intertwined with other issues.
    * **Upatyaka maa sainik upasthiti** (Military presence in the valley) - It details the disagreement between PA and Israel regarding the duration of military presence.
    * **Simaana maathi kaa vivadharu** (Border disputes) - The entire passage revolves around border disputes based on the 1967 war.

* **However, the passage does NOT mention *why* the 1967 war happened.** It only uses it as a reference point for the border disputes.

Therefore, the subject not mentioned in the passage is the *reason* for the 1967 war.



"
Tala madhye kun Palestine ko maag haina?,"The correct answer is **B: Jorden upatyaka maa jaari sainik upasthiti** (Continued military presence in the Jordan Valley).

Here's why:

The text states the disagreement revolves around how long Israeli military presence should last. Israel wants 10 years in the Jordan Valley, while the PA (Palestinian Authority) agrees to only 5 years.  This is the explicit point of contention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yudha aghiko srat maa aadharit simaana** (Borders based on pre-war lines): The text *states* Palestine wants borders based on the 1967 lines – this is a demand, not a disagreement *within* the negotiation.
* **C: Jerusalemko bhawishya kaa baare uttar haru** (Answers regarding the future of Jerusalem):  The text mentions Jerusalem is a related issue but doesn't state a disagreement *specifically* about it within this negotiation.
* **D: Jorden upatyaka maa paanch barsha samma sainik upasthiti** (5 years of military presence in the Jordan Valley): This is what the PA *agrees* to, not what they are demanding/disagreeing about.



"
Ma le kun muluk maa kaanun ko adhyayan gare?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanyukta Rajya America (United States of America)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hongkongma janmeki Ma(Ma)ley **new york university ra harward law schoolma** adhyayan gare...""  This directly translates to ""Born in Hong Kong, Ma(Ma) studied at New York University and Harvard Law School..."" Both of these universities are located in the United States of America.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: China:** While the person may have Chinese heritage, they studied in the US.
*   **C: Australia:**  The text doesn't mention Australia.
*   **D: Hong Kong:** They were *born* in Hong Kong, but studied law elsewhere.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, kun deshle wakalat gareka kaaran Ma le nirvachan jitna safal bhayin?","The correct answer is **D: China**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yea aropharuko bawajud, ma ley **chiniyan mukhya bhumisanga ghanishta sambandhako wakalat gardai** platform dakshatapurwak jit hasil gare."" 

This translates to: ""Despite these accusations, I skillfully won the platform by advocating for close ties with **Chinese** mainlands.""

Therefore, Ma won the election due to their advocacy related to China.



"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh gariye anusar, Carolyn Wilson le sahar janu pahile kaska laagi kaam garin?","Correct answer: **C: OHA**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the families realized Carolyn Wilson from **OHA** (presumably the Oakland Housing Authority) had embezzled their security deposits and left the city. This directly answers the question of what organization Carolyn Wilson worked for before leaving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: East Bay Community Law Center:** The law center hosted a meeting *about* the issue, but Carolyn Wilson didn't work there.
*   **B: Oakland prahari (Oakland Police):** The police are investigating *after* Wilson left.
*   **D: Lockwood Gardens:** Lockwood Gardens is where the affected families lived, not where Wilson worked.



"
"Season maa char race haru baaki huda, Drivers’ Championship ko chautho sthan maa ko chha?","The correct answer is **B: Kahne**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kahne ra Truex, Junior 2,220 ra 2,207 ankaka sath kramashah pachaun ra chhaithaun sthanma chan.""  This translates to ""Kahne and Truex Jr. are in fifth and sixth place respectively with 2,220 and 2,207 points.""

Since the question asks for the driver in *fourth* place, and we know Kahne is in fifth, and the text doesn't mention who is in fourth place, we need to look at the points. The text states that Johnson is in second with 2,243 points. Daud pachadi is in first with 2,250 points. Therefore, we need to find the driver with the third highest points. 

The text does not mention the driver with the third highest points, but it does tell us that Hamlin is five laps ahead of Boyarbhanda. Therefore, Hamlin must be in third place. 

The question asks for the driver in *fourth* place, which is Kahne.



"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh gariyeko race anusar, Drivers’ Championship maa Kahne ko kati angka raheko chha?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne ra Truex, Junior 2,220 ra 2,207 ankaka sath kramashah pachaun ra chhaithaun sthanma chan."" This directly translates to ""Kahne and Truex, Junior are in fifth and sixth place with 2,220 and 2,207 points respectively.""

Therefore, Kahne has 2220 points."
"Anuchhed anusar, kati patak manis harule awalokan gareko ulka pinda haru pachhi mangal graha maa utpatti bhaeko pramanit bhaeka chan?","The correct answer is **D: Chautis patak**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prithvima khaseko bhanera thaha bhaeka karib 24,000 vata ulka pindamadhye kewal 34 vata matri mangal grahabata aeko pushti bhaeko cha."" This translates to: ""Out of approximately 24,000 meteorites found on Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to originate from Mars.""

Therefore, 34 meteorites have been identified as originating from Mars."
"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaye anusar, mangal graha maa utpatti bhaeka chattan baare kun kura sacho ho?","The correct answer is **D: Tyaha 34 vata chan** (There are 34 of them).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prithvima khaseko bhanera thaha bhaeka karib 24,000 vata ulka pindamadhye kewal 34 vata matri mangal grahabata aeko pushti bhaeko cha.""  This directly translates to: ""Out of about 24,000 meteorites known to have fallen to Earth, only 34 are confirmed to have originated from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sabai July maa bhaeko ulka barsha maa bhetiyeka thiye** (They were all found in the July meteorite shower) - The passage mentions 15 were *given* for a July shower, but doesn't say they were *found* only in that shower.
*   **B: Tyaha 24,000 wata thiye** (There were 24,000 of them) -  24,000 is the total number of meteorites found on Earth, not just the Martian ones.
*   **C: Tinko mulya sun bhanda 11,000 americi dollar badhi chha** (Their price is $11,000 more than gold) - The passage states the price is 11,000 to 22,500 *dollars*, not specifically $11,000 *more* than gold. It also says ten times the price of gold, not $11,000 more.



"
Schumacher le kahile sanyas liye?,"The correct answer is **A: Felipe Massa ko durghatana pachii** (After Felipe Massa's accident).

Here's why:

The text states Schumacher retired *after* Massa had a serious accident in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. This directly links his retirement to the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unko saatau championship** (His seventh championship) - He retired *after* Massa's accident, not because of winning a championship.
* **C: Felipe Massako thaaun maa** (In Felipe Massa's place) - He *filled in for* Massa, but didn't retire in his place.
* **D: 2009 ko season ko antim maa jitepachhi** (After winning at the end of the 2009 season) - The text doesn't say he won at the end of the season; it says he retired *after* Massa's accident during the season.



"
Massa kahile ghaaite bhaye?,"The correct answer is **A: Grand Prix ko dauran maa**.

The text states: ""Sun 2009 ko hangeri grand priksko belama brazily manisko taukoma gambhir chotpatak lagyo."" This directly translates to ""During the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Brazilian driver Massa suffered a serious head injury.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Formula 1 championship jitepachhi:** The text says Schumacher retired *after* winning, not Massa.
* **C: Schumacher ko sanyas aghi:**  While related to Schumacher's retirement, it doesn't state *when* Massa was injured.
* **D: 2009 season agadi:** The injury happened *during* the season, specifically at the Hungarian Grand Prix.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yasto wyawastha le AOL lai kasari asar garnecha?","The correct answer is **A: AOL kaa prayogkarta ko sankhya badhna sakcha (AOL's user base can increase)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL, through widespread use within the US, can ""sarna ra vikas garna saksham bhaeko cha"" (be able to expand and develop) its IM market. This directly implies a potential increase in AOL's user base.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: AOL IM bajaar maa nirmaan garieko ek maatra company banne chha (AOL will become the only company established in the IM market)** - The passage states there is competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft, so AOL won't be the *only* company.
* **C: AOL kaa prayogkartaharuko sankhya laai Yahoo ra Microsoft kaa prayogkarta le takkar dine chhan (The number of AOL users will be challenged by Yahoo and Microsoft users)** - While there's competition, the passage focuses on AOL's *potential* for growth *despite* the competition.  It doesn't say their numbers will be reduced.
* **D: AOL sanyukta rajya america maa prayog hune chaina (AOL will not be used in the United States)** - The passage explicitly states AOL will have ""wyapak prayog"" (widespread use) within the US.



"
Naya byabastha pachhi tala madhya kun chai antya hune chha?,"The correct answer is **C: aafnai gati maa bajaar ko bikas garne AOL ko swatantrata** (AOL's freedom to develop the market on its own pace).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yasto wyawastha bhaema yo swatantrata antya hoon sakha."" (With such a system, this freedom might end.) This directly refers to AOL's independence.
* The passage discusses how AOL's widespread use in the US allows it to control and develop the market.  The fear is that competition from Yahoo! and Microsoft will *end* that control/freedom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanyukta rajya amerika maa wyapak internet ko bikas** (The widespread development of the internet in the USA) - The passage doesn't suggest the development of the internet itself will end.
* **B: IM bajaar ko prayog** (The use of the IM market) -  IM market use will likely *increase*, not end.
* **D: Yahoo ra Microsoft ko saajhedaari** (Yahoo and Microsoft's partnership) - The passage describes them as *competitors* to AOL, not partners.



"
Aakraman maa maarieka kati jana prahari thiyenan?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states ""dui police adhikariko mrityu bhayo"" which translates to ""two police officers died.""  The 19 mentioned refers to the number of injured police officers, not those who died.



"
aakraman ko aaropit lai kasle report garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Prahari**.

The text states: ""Praharile bhanyo key tiniharule yo akramanka lagi tathakathit dies (ISIL) ladakulai shanka garchhan."" This translates to ""Police said they suspect ISIS fighters for this attack."" Therefore, the police reported the suspicion of who was behind the attack."
"Florida maa jitne le sabai rajya paune hunale, Mitt romni lai ke pradan gariyo?","The correct answer is **B: Republican Party ko manonayan** (Republican Party's nomination).

Here's why:

The text states, ""Vijetale sabai rajya paune hunale, floridale afna pachas jana pratinidhiharulai Romneyley puraskrit garyo ra unlai republican partyko manonayanka lagi dekhauna aghadi badhayo.""  This translates to ""Because winning obtains all states, Romney awarded Florida's fifty representatives and moved forward to show them the Republican Party's nomination.""

Therefore, winning in Florida helped Mitt Romney advance towards securing the **Republican Party's nomination** for president.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, Gingrich le praathamik nirwachan maa kati pratishat vote prapta gare?","The correct answer is **B: 32 pratishat**.

The passage clearly states: ""Sadanka purva americi adhyaksha Newt Jingrich 32 pratishat prapta garera dosro sthanma ae."" (Former American President Newt Gingrich received 32 percent and came in second place.)



"
"Anuchhed anusar, caucus ko natija pachhi kasle daud lai nirantarta dienan?","The correct answer is **C: Peri**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Periko bhanaianusar """"uni az ratiko caucus natijako mulyankan garna texas farkane chan jasma ukta daudama unka lagi aghadi kunai bato cha wa chhaina bhanera nirdharan gardacha"""", tar pachhi unle daudama nai rahandai ra janawari 21 ko Dakshin Carolyna primaryma pratispardha gurney bataeka thee.""

This translates to: ""According to Perry, 'he will evaluate tonight's caucus results in Texas to determine if there is a path forward for him in the race,' then he dropped out of the race and announced he would compete in the South Carolina primary on January 21.""

This means Perry used the caucus results to decide whether to continue the race, effectively *discontinuing* it based on the results.  The question asks who discontinued the race *after* the caucus, and the text clearly states it was Perry.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, caucus ko natija pachhi kasle arko umwedwaar ko prashansa gare?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Natija aepachhi, jingrichle santoramko prashansa gareka thee..."" which translates to ""After the results, Gingrich praised Santorum...""

Therefore, Gingrich is the one who praised another candidate after the caucus results.



"
2015 agadi karyakram pradarshan garieko ek matra thaau kun thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suruwati dinma yo karyakram lamo samayadekhi sanchalanma raheko ra radio wartama kendrit rahane internet radio site **Toginet Radiyoma** matra upalabdha thiyo."" (In the early days, this program was broadcast for a long time and focused on radio news, only available on the internet radio site **TogiNet Radio**.)

This directly indicates that before 2015, the program was *only* shown on TogiNet Radio. While it later expanded to AstroNet Radio in 2015, it wasn't available anywhere else before that.
"
Station le karyakram le kasto spin bhaeko warnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Sthaaniya (Local)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yo pradarshanile mull rupma **purvi texuska sthaniya anubhawahin** awaz kalakarharu prastut garyo."" (This show initially featured **local, inexperienced** voice actors from East Texas.)

The question asks how the station describes the program. The description focuses on the actors being *local* to East Texas. While they are also described as inexperienced (""anubhawahin""), ""local"" is the aspect highlighted as a characteristic of the program itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anubhavhin (Experienced):** The passage explicitly states the actors were *inexperienced*.
*   **B: Biddwan (Scholarly/Intellectual):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about the program being scholarly or intellectual.
*   **C: Purano (Old):** While the station *is* an old school radio theatre, the question is about how the *program* is described, not the station itself.



"
David Headley le antata ke prapta gare jasle ladaku samuhako akraman lai sahayog garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Suchana (Information)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Devid Headlyko scouting ra jankari sankalanle (David Headley's scouting and information gathering) pakistani sainya samuha laskhar-ae-taibabata 10 banduksahitka manisdwara aparesanlai saksham banauna maddat gareko thiyo"" – meaning Headley's scouting and *information* helped enable the attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Grenade haru (Grenades):** While the attackers *used* grenades, Headley didn't provide those.
*   **C: Hatiyar dhaari vyakti (Armed people):** Headley didn't provide the attackers themselves.
*   **D: Swachaalit hatiyar haru (Automatic weapons):** He facilitated the attack but didn't directly supply the weapons.



"
Mumbai pugna ladaku samuhale kun yaatayaat ko saadhan ko prayog gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Dungaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""...November 26, 2008 maa **dungabata** aipugeka thee."" ( ...arrived by **boat** on November 26, 2008).

Therefore, the attackers used boats to reach Mumbai.



"
Kun wakya le Nadal ra Raonic ko Brisbane Open match ko natija lai sahi rupma pratibimbit garchha?,"Sahi jawab **C: Nadal le Raonic lai haraaye** ho.

P ma bhneko cha ki Nadal ko head to head record Raonic ko biruddha 7-2 cha, ra Brisbane Open ma Raonic Nadal ko biruddha parajit bhayo. Ya bata hunchha ki Nadal le Raonic lai haraaye.

अन्य विकल्प गलत छन् किनकि:

*   **A:** P ma bhneko cha Raonic parajit bhayo, haraaye bhanne chaina.
*   **B:** 88% net angka Nadal ko ho, Raonic ko chaina.
*   **D:** 76 anka Nadal le pahilo set ma prapta garyo, Raonic le chaina."
"Anuchhed anusar, pahilo serve pachhi Nadal ra Raonic ko match ko kun sthan thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: Score 7-2 thiyo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Canadali viruddha Nadalko head to head record 7-2 cha"" which translates to ""Nadal's head-to-head record against Canada is 7-2"".  This refers to the overall match record between Nadal and Raonic (representing Canada).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raonic sanga 88% net anka thiyo:** This refers to Nadal's net points, not Raonic's.
* **B: Nadal le 76 anka prapta gare:** This refers to Nadal's first serve percentage, not the overall match score.
* **D: Raonic le Nadal lai haraaye:** The 7-2 record indicates Nadal has won more matches, not Raonic.



"
Teen naya Naked News prasaran maa kun bhasa ko karyakram samaawesh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Japanese**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Naked News already reports in English and Japanese, and is *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not a *new* language being added to their broadcasts.

"
"Anuchhed anusar, naya Naked News ko prashaasaran kaha uplabdha hune chhainan?","The correct answer is **C: Cinema ghar** (Cinema halls).

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News will expand its reporting to television, web (internet), and mobile devices with the new languages. It doesn't mention any plans to broadcast in cinema halls. Therefore, cinema halls are the only option where the new broadcasts will *not* be available.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mobile phone** - The passage explicitly states programs will be available on mobile devices.
*   **B: Internet** - The passage explicitly states programs will be available on the web (internet).
*   **D: Television** - The passage explicitly states programs will be available on television.



"
Giant Slalom lai kati jana pratishpardhi le sampanna garenan?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""giant slalomma 117 cool skier madhye 45 ley daudama shreni pauna sakenan,"" which translates to ""In the giant slalom, 45 out of 117 skiers were unable to finish the race.""  Therefore, 45 competitors did not complete the giant slalom.
"
Yea madhye kun wakya le Championship ko race ko natija lai sahirup maa pratibimbit garchhan?,"Sahi uttar ho **D: Carpenado le Slalom maa dashau sthan maa sampta gare**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Mahila sitting samuhama char skier afno run pura garna asafal bhae ra giant slalomma 117 cool skier madhye 45 ley daudama shreni pauna sakenan."" and ""any jaati, joint slalomle mahilako basobas samuhama ... unle dashaun sthanma samapta gareko dekhin."" This directly shows Carpenado finishing in 10th place in the slalom race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention Hungary's skiers specifically being ahead in the second race. It focuses on Carpenado's performance.
*   **B:** While the passage does state 45 skiers couldn't finish the giant slalom, it doesn't represent the overall race results as much as Carpenado's specific result.
*   **C:** The passage states 117 skiers participated in Giant Slalom and 45 couldn't finish which doesnt mean more skiers finished the Giant Slalom than the Slalom.



"
Yea madhye NBA le ke sthagit garne nirnaya garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA *suspended its ongoing basketball season*. The question asks what prompted the NBA to take action. The action was suspending the season, and the reason was related to COVID-19 concerns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Utah jazz ko euta kheladi** - While a Utah Jazz player testing positive was *a trigger*, it wasn't what the NBA suspended.
*   **C: COVID-19 sankaramit kunai pani kheladi** - Similar to B, this is a contributing factor, but not the direct thing the NBA acted upon.
*   **D: Utah jazz basketball toli** - The entire team wasn't the reason, it was a positive test within the team.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, ke kaaran le virus ko baarema NBA ko chaso nimtyayo?","The correct answer is **B: Utah jazz ko khel maa thuprai kheladi sangkramit bhae** (Several players on the Utah Jazz team were infected).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yuta jazz kheladiko COVID-19 bhairasko parikshan sakaratmak dekhiepachhi NBA ko nirnaya ayo."" (The NBA decision came after a positive COVID-19 test for Utah Jazz players.)
* This directly indicates that the infection of players on the Utah Jazz team was the reason for the NBA's suspension.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: NBA kaa sadasya haru sangkramit bhaeka thiye** (NBA members were infected) - While likely true, the passage *specifically* mentions Utah Jazz players as the catalyst.
* **C: Sangraman pachhi utah jazz ko euta kheladi le kamjor pradarshan gare** (After the infection, a Utah Jazz player performed poorly) - The passage doesn't mention player performance.
* **D: Utah jazz ko euta kheladi sangkramit bhae** (A Utah Jazz player was infected) -  ""Thuprai"" (several) is more accurate according to the passage, indicating multiple players were affected.



"
Atlanta Thrashers birudda ko khel ma Washington capitals ka lagi kasle nirnayak goal gare?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Obhechin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Unle 2 goal gare ra yass 2 golle atlanta thrasarralai 5-3 ley jitna wassingtonlai sahayog garyo."" This means Alex Ovechkin scored 2 goals which helped Washington win against Atlanta Thrashers with a score of 5-3. While Backstrom assisted on the game-winning goal, Ovechkin *scored* the goals that were crucial to the victory.



"
Capitals ra thrasaers ko khelma kasle season ko 60au goal gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Obhechin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...yasasangai uni sun 1995-1996 dekhi euta sijanma 60 wa sobhanda badhi goal gurney pahilo kheladi bane. tyatibela Jaromir Jogger ra Mario Lamiox duwai janale ukta milestone prapta gareka thee."" which translates to ""...with this, he became the first player to score 60 or more goals in a season since 1995-1996. At that time, Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux had previously achieved this milestone.""

The text clearly indicates Alex Ovechkin is the player who *recently* achieved the 60-goal milestone, after Jagr and Lemieux.



"
Northern rock bank lai sarkar baata kahile sahayata awashyak bhayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhito sankat ko belama (During the credit crisis)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nardan raklai sun 2007 maa subprime dhito sankatka samayama yasako exposureka karan samarthan awashyak pareko thiyo.""  This directly translates to ""Northern Rock needed support in 2007 during the subprime credit crisis because of its exposure.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bank rashtriyakaran bhae pachhi (After the bank was nationalized)** - The crisis *led* to nationalization, it didn't happen *after*.
*   **B: Jaba bank sampati wyawasthapan company baata tukriyo (When the bank was broken into an asset management company)** - This happened *as a result* of the crisis and nationalization, not when support was initially needed.
*   **C: Bharjin samuha le bank kharid garepachhi (After Branson's group bought the bank)** - Branson's bid was *rejected*, he didn't buy the bank.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun wakya le northern rock bank sanga samuha ko kaarobar lai sahi rupmaa vyaakhya garchha?","The correct answer is **B: Bharjin samuha le raashtriyakaran pachhi bank kharid garyo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bharjinle uttari chattanko """"ramro bank"""" kharid gareko cha, sampatti wyawasthapan company hoina."" This directly translates to ""Virgin Group bought the 'good bank' (Northern Rock plc), *not* the asset management company.""  This means they bought the bank *after* it was nationalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bharjin samuha le northern rock ko sampati wyawasthapan compani pani kharid garyo** - The passage explicitly says they *didn't* buy the asset management company.
* **C: Dhito sangkat ko belaama, Bharjin samuha le bank lai aapatkaalin sahaayata garne prastaav garyo** - While they *did* make a bid during the subprime crisis, the passage says it was rejected.
* **D: Bank ko laagi Bharjin samuha ko pahilo boli rashtriyakaran pachhi raakhiyo** -  The passage says their bid was rejected *before* the nationalization.



"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhae anusar, kyoto mausam samjhauta maa hastantaran garnaale kun muluk lai asar garyo?","The correct answer is **A: Sanyukta rajya america (United States of America)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kyoto mausam samjhautama hastakshar gurney rudko nirnayale **sanyukta rajyalai** tadha rakhchha."" This translates to ""...the decision of George W. Bush to not sign the Kyoto Protocol **affected the United States**.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states the United States was affected by the decision regarding the Kyoto Protocol.



"
Australia ko purva sarkar le kyoto ko anumodan le kaslai noksan garne batayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Muluko arthatantra** (The country's economy).

Here's why:

The passage states that the former conservative government of Australia refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, believing that obligating countries like India and China to emission targets would harm the economy, which is heavily reliant on coal exports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sanyukta rajya america** (United States of America) - The passage mentions the US is affected by the decision, but doesn't say the Australian government *believed* the Kyoto approval would harm the US.
*   **C: Koila niryat** (Coal exports) - While coal exports are mentioned as a dependency of the economy, the *economy* itself is what the government feared would be harmed.
*   **D: Muluk ko utsarjan laxya** (Country's emission targets) - The government was concerned about *other* countries' emission targets impacting *their* economy, not their own.



"
Trail maa shooter harulai kun karyakramko laagi bharti garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sporting shooter sangh ko shikaar karyakram**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""NPWS ra sporting shooters association off australia (NSW) inkko sajhedarima, **sporting shooters associationko shikar karyakram** antargat yogya swayamsewakharu bharti garie."" This directly translates to ""NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) partnered, and suitable volunteers were recruited under the **Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Australia sporting shooters sangh karyakram** - While related, the text specifically mentions the *hunting program* within the association.
*   **B: Park sanrakshan ra sampadaa karyakram** - This refers to the broader work of NPWS, not the specific program the shooters were recruited for.
*   **C: NPWS karyakram** - NPWS partnered *with* the association, but the shooters were recruited for *the association's* program.



"
kun vakya le kit niyantran trial lai sahi rupmaa pratibimbit gardaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo karyakram ko pahilo trial bhaeko le, yasko mulyankan bahena** (This program being the first trial means it wasn't evaluated).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Parikshanko nigarani garieko ra yasako prabhawkaritako mulyankan garieko hunale renjarharule purak kira niyantran parikshanma suterharuko najikaibata nirikshan garnupareko thiyo.**"" (The rangers closely monitored the shooters in the supplementary deer control trial because it had been monitored and its effectiveness evaluated).  

This directly contradicts option A, which claims the trial *wasn't* evaluated.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Shooter harule parikshah nirdeshan prapta gare** (Shooters received instructions for the trial) - The passage says: ""**pahilo suiting sanchalanka lagi chhanieka char suterle wistrit suraksha ra prashikshan nirdeshan prapta gare.**"" (Four shooters selected for the first shooting session received detailed safety and training instructions).
* **C: Shooter haru lai ranger harule nirikshan gare** (Shooters were monitored by rangers) - The first sentence of the passage confirms this.
* **D: Chhaar shooter haruko chhanot gariyo** (Four shooters were selected) - The passage states: ""**pahilo suiting sanchalanka lagi chhanieka char suterle...**"" (Four shooters were selected for the first shooting session...).



Therefore, **A** is the only statement that doesn't align with the information provided in the passage."
"Anuchhed anusar, vibhajan kaha bhetiyo?","The correct answer is **A: Rift upatyaka maa (In the Rift Valley)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yasako matlab vibhajan anawik pramanle anuman garebhanda dherai pahileko ho... ethiopiako rift bhyali research sarbhiska anweshak ra adhyayanka saha lekhak barhane esfawle bhane.""  This translates to: ""its meaning (referring to something) was discovered much earlier than predicted by scientific evidence... Barhane Esfaw, a research scientist and co-author of the study in the Ethiopian Rift Valley...""

This directly links the discovery (vibhajan - which means division/splitting in this context) to the Ethiopian Rift Valley.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, apekshya gare bhanda aghi ke bhayo?","The correct answer is **A: Jiwashma ko khoj (Fossil discovery)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yass jiwashmako adharma...dherai pahileko ho."" which translates to ""This fossil is older than expected based on theoretical calculations.""  This directly indicates a fossil discovery happened *before* expectations were set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vibhajan (Division):** The passage mentions 'vibhajan' (division) in the context of how the calculations were done, not as something that happened earlier.
* **C: Aanawik praman ko vishleshan (Theoretical analysis):** The passage says the fossil is *older* than the theoretical calculations, meaning the analysis came *after* the fossil was found.
* **D: Rift upatyaka ma anusandhan (Research in the Rift Valley):** While the passage mentions research in the Ethiopian Rift Valley, it doesn't say this research occurred *before* the fossil discovery. It's the context *of* the discovery, not something preceding it.



"
Video game maa chal niyantran garna kheladi le ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Controller laai hawama chalaunuhos** (Move the controller through the air).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...yasako sahayatale kheladiharu bhidiyo gemka axone ra chalharu yo yantralai hawa yatauta chalaera niyantran garna sakchhan."" which translates to ""...with its help players can play video games and move by controlling this device by waving it in the air.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Controller ko sensor haru console najik avasthit garna sunishchit garnuhos** (Ensure the controller's sensors are near the console) - While sensors are involved, the *action* isn't keeping them near the console, it's moving the controller.
* **B: Uniharu ko sthan trikoniya akarmaa rakhnuhos** (Keep their position in a triangular shape) - This refers to the sensor placement, not what the player does.
* **C: Television najik sensor rakhnuhos** (Place sensors near the television) - Again, this is about setup, not the player's action.



"
Television remote jasto dekhina ke design garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nintendo Revolution controller**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""yasako sahayatale kheladiharu bhidiyo gemka axone ra chalharu yo yantralai hawa yatauta chalaera niyantran garna sakchhan"" (This allows players to experience video games and move them by waving this device in the air). This clearly describes the functionality of the Nintendo Revolution controller, which was known for its motion control capabilities.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""trikoniya sthanma trikonmit garna prayogkartako televisionko najikai rakhieka duiwata sensarharu prayogkartacha"" (two sensors placed near the TV were used to triangulate the position). This refers to the sensor bar that came with the Revolution controller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Controller ko dui sensorharu (The controller's two sensors):**  This is *part* of the answer, but doesn't describe the overall design.
* **C: Mukhya prastuti (Main presentation):** This refers to the event where it was shown, not the device itself.
* **D: Nintendo Revolution console:** The passage focuses on the *controller*, not the console itself.  The console's design is mentioned as being shown, but the focus is on how the controller works.



"
Xinhua samachar agency ko pachhillo report maa kun kura ullekh garieko thiena?,"The correct answer is **D: Plane kandahar ma avataran bhayo** (Plane landed in Kandahar).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...vimanle bamko dhamki paeko thiyo ra **kandaharma awataran gurney gari**, afghanistan firta pathaieko thiyo."" ( ...the plane received a bomb threat and **was diverted to land in Kandahar**, and was sent towards Afghanistan.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Plane le bomb ko dhamki paeko thiyo** (Plane received a bomb threat) - While true, this is mentioned *before* the landing, and the question asks about the *latest* report's information.
*   **B: Plane urumaqi ma avataran bhayo** (Plane landed in Urumqi) - The passage states Urumqi *rejected* the emergency landing.
*   **C: Plane Afghanistan tarfa pathaiyo** (Plane was sent towards Afghanistan) - This describes the direction it was travelling, not the specific landing location.



"
Xinhua samachar agency ko suru ko report ma ke ullekhit garieko thiena?,"The correct answer is **A: Plane hijack garieko thiyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Yasabhanda phile chiniyan samachar agency Xinhualey euta vimaan hijack bhaeko khabar gare."" (Yasabhanda previously, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported a plane was hijacked). This is the initial report mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says the initial report mentioned a refusal of emergency landing *after* reporting the hijacking.
*   **C:**  The flight to Afghanistan is mentioned as a later development based on reports.
*   **D:** The bomb threat is also presented as information that came *after* the initial hijacking report.



"
Radio karyakram maa Sara Danius le ke ghoshana garin?,"The correct answer is **C: 2016 ko Saahitya tarfa ko nobel puraskar ko manonayan** (The nomination for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature).

Here's why:

The passage states Sara Danius publicly announced on Swedish Radio that the committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature and had given up trying.  This means she announced the *nomination* (or the fact that he was chosen) but also the difficulty in contacting him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sahitya tarfa ko Nobel puraskar ko bijeta** (The winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature) - While the announcement relates to the winner, the passage focuses on the *process* of announcing and the issues with reaching Dylan, not simply naming him the winner.
*   **B: Samiti le sajhedaar haru bata kunai jawaaf paena** (The committee didn't receive any response from its partners) - The passage says Danius *did* receive friendly responses from Dylan's close associates.
*   **D: Samiti le Dealan sanga samparka garne karya banda garne cha** (The committee will stop contacting Dylan) - This is a consequence of the announcement, but not *what* was announced.



"
Ko sanga sambarka bhaena?,"The correct answer is **B: Sara Danius**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sombarka dina Sara Danius, swidis ekedemyma nobel sahitya samitika sthaayi sachible..."" (On the day, Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Literature Committee...).  It then describes *her* communication with someone regarding Bob Dylan. The passage specifically says she had contact (""najikaiko sahayogilai phone ra email pathaera"") and received friendly responses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bob Dealan ko najikko sajhedar (Bob Dylan's close partner):** The passage mentions communication *to* Dylan's close partner, but doesn't state Sara Danius *was* that partner.
*   **C: Swedish Academy:** While Sara Danius represents the Swedish Academy, the passage focuses on *her* individual communication, not the Academy's as a whole.
*   **D: Bob Dealan:**  The passage describes attempts to reach Bob Dylan, but not communication *from* him directly to the speaker.



"
Kasle pratibadhata laai “ek pramukh kadam” bhaeko tipani garnu bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: George W. Bush**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bushka praakta gorden jondrole utter koreako yo pratibadhatalai """"koreali prayadwipma pramanit paramanu n prapta gurney lakshyako dishama euta mahatwapurna kadam bhane."""" "" 

This translates to: ""Bush stated that this commitment by North Korea was ""an important step towards the goal of a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.""""

Therefore, George W. Bush is the one who called the commitment ""an important step"".



"
Slania le vibhinna muluk haruka lagi kati tikat utpadan gare?,"The correct answer is **D: 1,000 mathi** (more than 1,000).

The text states: ""Unle sweden ra 28 any deshharuka lagi 1,000bhanda badhi tikatharu utpadan gareka thee."" which translates to ""He produced more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2,000 mathi** - The text doesn't specify a number close to 2,000.
*   **B: 1000** - The text explicitly states *more than* 1,000.
*   **C: lagbhag 2,000** -  Again, there's no indication of approximately 2,000 in the text.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, tanky vent bata ninrantar chuhawat hune sambhawat kaaran ke ho?","The correct answer is **C: Thermal wista** (Thermal expansion).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Budhbar d, tankyka nikasharu sambhawat tanky bhitrako thermal wistarbata ajhai pani chuhine nai thee.""  This translates to ""Wednesday, the possibility of leakage from the tank still existed due to thermal expansion inside the tank.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madhyamik containment area kshamata samma bharieko thiyo** (Secondary containment area was full to capacity) - While the secondary containment area *was* full, the passage states the potential for continued leakage is due to *thermal expansion*, not simply the area being full.
* **B: Agni command pranaliko niyamit parikshan** (Regular testing of the fire command system) - The fire command system test *caused* the valve to open, but it's not the reason for the *continued* potential leakage.
* **D: Fort greely ko euta pump station ma ago lagnu** (A fire at a pump station at Fort Greely) -  There was no mention of a fire at the pump station, only that the valve near pump station 9 overflowed.



"
Relief valve haru kina khule?,"The correct answer is **A: Tanky haru bhitra thermal wista bhaeko thiyo** (The tanks were thermally expanding).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Budhbar d,tankyka nikasharu sambhawat tanky bhitrako thermal wistarbata ajhai pani chuhine nai thee."" (Wednesday, it was still leaking due to thermal expansion inside the tanks). This directly links the leak to the tanks expanding due to heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pranaliko parikshan pachhi power failure bhaeko thiyo** (There was a power failure after the pipeline test) - While a power failure *contributed* to the initial problem (valve opening), it didn't cause the *continued* leak from the tanks.
* **C: Tanky haru purai kshamata samma bharieka thie** (The tanks were full to capacity) - The passage states another containment area was full, but doesn't say the leaking tanks were at capacity *before* the thermal expansion.
* **D: Madhyamik containment kshetra le paryapta barrel atauna sakena** (The secondary containment area could hold enough barrels) - This is irrelevant to *why* the valves opened/leaked. It just describes the containment capacity.



"
Haal ninth waad maa pani kati mathi cha?,"The correct answer is **D: 100 feet**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pani 100 feet chaudaima sethumathi bagiraheko cha."" which translates to ""The water is flowing with a height of 100 feet.""  This directly answers the question of how high the water is in the ninth ward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 20 feet** - This was the height of the levee *during* Hurricane Katrina, not the current water level.
* **B: 6 inch** - This refers to the size of the warshale (presumably a type of tool) being used, not the water level.
* **C: kammarsamma** - This refers to the color of the water (""kammarsamma"" means roughly ""muddy"" or ""brownish""), not its height.



"
Katrina toofan ko belama ninth ward maa ke ghatana bhayo?,"The correct answer is **C: badhi ko pani 20 feet mathi thiyo** (The water in the levee was more than 20 feet high).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nawaun ward, jahaan toofan Katrinaka bela 20 feet samma uchai bhaeko badhi aeko thiyo..."" (Ninth ward, where during Hurricane Katrina the levee was about 20 feet high...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Badhi ko pani 100 feet chauda thiyo** (The water in the levee was 100 feet wide) - The passage states the water was 100 feet *deep*, not wide.
*   **B: kammarmaathi samko pani le badhi nagyo** (The water coming from the bottom didn't break the levee) - The passage doesn't say this. It says the engineers are *trying* to break a damaged levee.
*   **D: 6 inch varsha le bhatkieko bandh paar garyo** (6 inches of rain broke the levee) - The passage mentions 6 inch warshale but this is about current efforts to break the levee, not what happened during Katrina.



"
tala ullekh garie madhye kun chahi Hamilton le pushti garenan?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaha virami le bhraman gareka thie** (Where the patient had travelled).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the patient *was from Nigeria, where there had been some cases of the Ebola virus*. Hamilton Health Sciences confirmed this travel history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aru virami virus ko samparka maa aune sambhavana** (The possibility of other patients coming into contact with the virus) - The passage mentions the hospital isolating the patient *to prevent* potential spread, not confirming spread.
* **C: Yadi awayask protocol ko palana garieko thiyo** (Whether or not isolation protocol was followed) - The passage states the hospital *did* follow the protocols, it doesn't question if they were followed.
* **D: Birami ko bartaman awastha** (The patient's current condition) - The passage states the patient is *stable*, but Hamilton confirmed this – it's not what they were initially confirming.

Therefore, the only thing Hamilton Health Sciences specifically confirmed in the passage was the patient's travel history to Nigeria.



"
Vaigyanik haru ke patta lagauna chanchan?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba puchhretara kahile prithvi sanga thokincha** (When the comet collided with Earth).

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists hope to understand *how planets like Earth were formed* by studying comets, specifically those that collided with Earth early on. The passage focuses on whether comets could have delivered the building blocks of life (proteins and organic matter).  Therefore, knowing *when* a comet impacted Earth is crucial to understanding this process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Protein kasari banchan** (How proteins are made) - The passage states comets *may* have delivered proteins, but doesn’t focus on the process of protein creation itself.
* **C: Jaivik padartha ke ho** (What organic matter is) - While the passage mentions organic matter, it's not the primary question scientists are trying to answer.
* **D: Prithvi kasari banyo** (How Earth was formed) -  This is a broader question, and the passage focuses on a specific aspect of Earth's formation – the role of comets.  The comet impacts are *part* of how Earth formed, but the key focus is on *when* those impacts happened.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, banda garaunu maa sthaniya prahari le ke bhumika khele?","The correct answer is **A: Uniiharu le FB banda garna agraha gare** (They requested the FBI to close the road).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""maryland yatayat pradhikaranle FBI ko agrahama band garyo"" which translates to ""the Maryland Transportation Authority closed [the road] at the FBI's request."" This clearly indicates the local police (represented by the Maryland Transportation Authority) *requested* the FBI to close the road.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uniiharu le banda garne nirnaya gare** (They decided to close the road) - The passage says the FBI requested the closure, not that the local authorities decided it themselves.
*   **C: Uniiharu le sawari chalak lai arko bato tarfa nirdeshit gare** (They directed riders to another road) - This was done by ""tipperharu tube praeshdwarharu"" (tip trucks and lane closure personnel), not the police.
*   **D: Uniiharu le vaikalpik bato ma yatayat dhillai report gare** (They reported traffic delays on alternate routes) - The passage specifically states there were *no* reported delays on alternate routes.



"
Banda ko samay ma tube pravesh dwaar lai ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti banda gariye**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Tipperharu tube praeshdwarharu roknaka lagi prayog garieka thee"" which translates to ""Tippers were used to block the tube entrances."" This directly answers the question of what happened to the tube entrances – they were *closed/blocked*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti vaikalpik marga ka rupma prayog bhaye** - The text mentions alternative routes were available, but doesn't say they were *used* to block the entrances.
*   **C: Ti sawari chalak ka lagi khula thie** - The text says they were being *blocked*, not kept open.
*   **D: Tyaha sawari chap dherai thiyo** - The text doesn't mention anything about crowding.



"
"Anucched anusar, photographer laai gaaadi le hirkaunu aghi ke bhaeko thiena?","The correct answer is **B: Photographer le afno gadi Sepulveda bolebhard ma park gareka thie** (Photographer had parked his car on Sepulveda Boulevard).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""TMZley bujhdacha key photographerle sepulveda bolebhardko arkopatti afno gadi roke ra sadak paar garnuaghi..."" This translates to ""TMZ understands that the photographer parked his car on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard and began to cross the street...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Photographer lai raajmarga prahari le bato pari firta jaana nirdeshan dieko thiyo** (The highway patrol officer directed the photographer to walk on the road) - This is what happened *after* he parked, as a result of trying to photograph and cross the road. It wasn't what was happening *before* he was hit.
*   **C: Photographer le prahari stop ko photo khiche** (Photographer took a photo of the police stop) - The text says he *tried* to, but it doesn't confirm he successfully did.
*   **D: Photographer le Bieber ko photo khichna safal bhae** (Photographer succeeded in taking a photo of Bieber) - The passage doesn't mention Justin Bieber at all.



"
Photographer laai gadi le hirkaaunu aghi ke garne prayas gardai thie?,"The correct answer is **B: Prahari stop ko photo lina**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""TMZ ley bujhdacha key photographerle sepulveda bolebhardko arkopatti afno gadi roke ra sadak paar garnuaghi ra **police stopko taswira khichne prayas gare** ra sadak paar garna zari rakhe..."" 

This directly translates to: ""TMZ understands that the photographer parked his car on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard and was trying to **take a picture of the police stop** and continued to cross the street...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sepulveda bolebhard maa park garna** - While he *did* park on Sepulveda Boulevard, that wasn't his primary action leading to the incident.
*   **C: Vyasta raajmaarga maa baato kaatna** - The text doesn't explicitly state he was trying to cause a disturbance on the highway.
*   **D: Prahari laai ajhai photo khichna anurodh garna** - The text only says he tried to take a picture of the police stop, not ask to take more pictures.

Yea madhye kun wakya le virus sankraman pachhi rashtrapati ko avastha sahi ruple bataudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Unlaai sancho mahasush bhaeko chaina** (He doesn't feel completely healthy).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Jwaro ra ghati dukhaika bahek, maha dursanchar garera afno cam pura garnaka lagi swastha mahasus garchhu ra ramro awasthama chu."" (Besides fever and body aches, he feels healthy enough to carry out his duties and is in a good condition.)  Then he adds, ""maha sombarsammama afna sabai kartawyaharuma farkane asha garchhu"" (he hopes to fully participate in all his duties soon).

* **However, the very beginning states he's been infected:** ""Adhyakshiy mantri Rodrigo Ariyasle areas bhairasko halka sankramanko sakaratmak parikshan garieko kura gareka chan."" (Prime Minister Rodrigo Arias has tested positive for a mild infection outside the areas.)

These two statements conflict. Saying he's healthy *enough* to work isn't the same as saying he feels *completely* healthy, especially after a virus infection.  He acknowledges symptoms (fever and aches) and the hope of *returning* to full capacity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unko galaa avarudda chha** (His throat is blocked) - The text doesn't mention anything about a blocked throat.
* **C: Unko awastha sthir chha** (His condition is stable) - The text *does* say his condition is stable (""Rashtrapatiko awastha sthira bhae pani..."")
* **D: Unlaai Jwaro aaeko chha** (He has a fever) - The text explicitly mentions he has a fever (""Jwaro ra ghati dukhaika bahek..."")



Therefore, **A** is the only option that indicates a lingering effect of the virus and suggests he isn't fully recovered."
"Anuchhed anusar, tala dieko madhye rashtrapati ko baare kun wakya sahi ho?","The correct answer is **C: Unii dursanchhar garna sakne awastha maa chhan** (He is in a condition to communicate remotely).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""maha dursanchar garera afno cam pura garnaka lagi swastha mahasus garchhu ra ramro awasthama chu."" This translates to ""He feels healthy and is in good condition to complete his work through remote communication.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unlaai Jwaro aaeko chhaina (He doesn't have a fever):** The passage explicitly mentions ""Jwaro ra ghati dukhaika bahek"" (besides fever and body aches), meaning he *does* have a fever.
* **B: Uni kaiyau haptaa samma ghar mai rahane chhan (He will stay home for several weeks):** The passage says he needs to isolate for ""kehi dinka"" (a few days), not several weeks.
* **D: Unlaai gambhir kisimko virus le sankraman gareko chha (He has been infected with a serious virus):** The passage only mentions a ""halka sankraman"" (mild infection) - it doesn't specify the severity of the virus.

"Anuchhed anusar, tropical cyclone gonu kahile kamjor hune apeksha garieko chha?","The correct answer is **B: Jaba hawa ko gati 83 kilometer prati ghanta maa jharyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ajko suruma, hawa 83 kimmy prati ghantako waripari thiyo ra yo kamjor rahirahane apeksha garieko thiyo.""  This translates to: ""Today, the wind was around 83 km/h and it was expected to weaken.""

Therefore, the expectation of weakening was directly linked to the wind speed being at 83 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maldives pugnu aghi:** The passage doesn't mention expectation of weakening *before* reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: Charam bindu maa pugnu aghi:** The passage doesn't discuss a peak or climax.
*   **D: Jaba hawa ko gati 149 miles prati ghanta pugnu aghi:** The passage says the cyclone *reached* 149 mph, not that it was expected to weaken at that point.



"
Tropical cyclone gonu charam bindu maa pugdaa hawa ko gati kati dherai thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilometer prati ghanta**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tropical cyclone gonu, 240 kilometer prati ghanta (149 mile prati ghanta) co nirantar hawasamma pugyo."" This means the cyclone *reached* a sustained wind speed of 240 kilometers per hour (which is equivalent to 149 miles per hour).
* **The question asks:** about the *peak* wind speed.
* While 240 km/h is the peak in kilometers, 149 mph is the equivalent in miles per hour.  The question doesn't specify units, but option A directly reflects the kilometer per hour value given in the text as the peak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 240 mile prati ghanta** - Incorrect.  The passage states 240 *kilometers* per hour.
* **C: 149 mile prati ghanta** - Incorrect. This is the *equivalent* wind speed in miles per hour, but not the peak speed described in the main part of the sentence.
* **D: 83 kilometer prati ghanta** - Incorrect. This was the wind speed *earlier* in the day, and the cyclone was expected to *weaken* to that speed, not reach its peak.



"
Yea madhye kun chaahi karenia brevis ko viseshta maani daina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo bahukoshiya ho** (It is multicellular).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Prakritik rupma hune **ekal koshikayukta** samudri jiwale hune rato chaal..."" (Naturally occurring red tide, a **single-celled** marine organism...) This directly contradicts option C, which says it's multicellular (bahukoshiya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo ek prakaar ko leu ho** (It is a type of algae) - The text refers to *Karenia brevis* as a marine organism capable of producing neurotoxins, aligning with it being a type of algae (specifically a dinoflagellate).
* **B: Yasle manisko nashaa banda garna sakchha** (It can cause neurological effects in humans) - The text explicitly says it produces neurotoxins that can affect humans.
* **D: Yo praakritik rupmai paahinchha** (It occurs naturally) - The text states ""Prakritik rupma hune..."" (Naturally occurring...).



"
Tala die madhyeh karena brevis ke garna asamartha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Maachha ko nashaa banda garna (To cause fish kills)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Panima wishaktatako uccha gadhapanle garda prayaha machha marchhan."" This directly translates to ""High concentrations of toxins in the water cause fish kills.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jun sukai awasthamaa aafno sankhya wyaparik rupmaa badhauna (To commercially increase their numbers in dry conditions):** The passage states the opposite – they proliferate when conditions are *favorable* for toxin production.
* **C: Pani lai asar garna (To affect the water):** While they *are* in the water, the key impact described is on living organisms, specifically fish.
* **D: Neurotoxin utpadan garna (To produce neurotoxins):**  The passage *states* they produce neurotoxins, but this isn't the reason *why* Karenia brevis is problematic. The problem is the *effect* of the neurotoxins – the fish kills.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, tala diekaa madhye kun ghatana felicia aandhi ko karan bhaeko hoina?","The correct answer is **D: Bato maa badhi aaunu (Flooding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yasaka awasheshharule adhikansh tapuharuma warsha utpadan gare, tar ahilesamma, kunai kshati wa badhiko report garieko chhaina."" This translates to: ""The remnants of Yasaka produced rainfall in most islands, but still, no damage or flooding was reported."" 

Therefore, flooding was *not* a consequence of Felicia (or Yasaka's remnants as the passage connects them). The passage explicitly states there was no flooding reported.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as occurring with/related to the storm:

*   **A: Faidajanak warsha (Beneficial Rainfall):** The passage specifically describes the rainfall as ""faidajanak"" (beneficial) with a measurement of 6.34 inches.
*   **B: Chatyang sangai aaeko warsha (Rain accompanying lightning):** The passage mentions ""Kehi warshaka sath aandhibehari ra lagatar chatyang pareko thiyo"" meaning there was lightning accompanying the rain for several years.
*   **C: Lagataar bijuli chamkanu (Continuous lightning):** This is directly stated in the passage as happening alongside the rain.



"
Felicia aandhi baare galat wakya kun ho?,"The correct answer is **A: warsha le Oahu laai faida garyo** (The rain benefited Oahu).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the 6.34 inches of rain was described as ""beneficial,"" but it *doesn't* say it benefited Oahu specifically.** It just says the remnants of the storm produced rainfall across most islands. Attributing the benefit *to* Oahu is a misinterpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **B: Yaslai shreni 4 ko aandhi maanu aghi ushna pradeshiya sankuchan ko rupmaa vargikaran garieko thiyo** (It was categorized as a category 4 hurricane before weakening due to warm-water contraction) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Praaya taapu haru ma warsha bhayo** (Rain fell on the Hawaiian islands) -  The passage says, ""Yasaka awasheshharule adhikansh tapuharuma warsha utpadan gare"" (The remnants of Felicia produced rainfall across most islands).
* **D: Varsha sangai bijuli pani chamkeko thiyo** (Lightning also struck with the rain) - The passage mentions ""Kehi warshaka sath aandhibehari ra lagatar chatyang pareko thiyo"" (There was rain with storms and continuous lightning).



Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* supported by the provided text."
Tala dieko madhye kun wakya le 2009 ko Hungarian Grand Prix ko natija lai sahi rupmaa pratibimbit garchha?,"Sahi jawāb **C: Piquet Jr. laai pachhi barkhasta gariyo** ho.

Tala dieko paragraphma spastai bhayeko chha ki Piquet Jr. lai 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix pachhi barkhasta gariyo. Arū vakya harū paragraphma sahi rupmaa pratibimbit garnan.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso durghatnama parekaa thie** - Although the paragraph mentions Alonso being involved in an accident, it's about the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, not 2009 Hungary.
*   **B: Piquet Jr. le bijay praapt gare** - The paragraph doesn’t state that Piquet Jr. won the race.
*   **D: Suraksha gadi durghatana ma pareko thiyo** - The paragraph mentions a safety car being deployed, but not that it was involved in an accident."
Durghatana kahile bhaeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaba aru gadi indhan bhardai thie** (When other cars were refueling).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alonsoko rokawatka karan pucate juniyarko sun 2008 ko singapurma bhaeko grand prixma durghatana bhaeko thiyo. Alonsobhanda agadika carharu suraksha carmuni indhanka lagibhitra pasda...""  This translates to: ""Fernando Alonso had an accident because of Piquet Jr. in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. Cars ahead of Alonso were refueling when the safety car came out...""

This directly links the accident to other cars refueling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alonso ko pit stop lagattai** (Right after Alonso's pit stop) - The text doesn't mention Alonso's pit stop being related to the accident.
*   **C: Surakshya gadi aaunu bhanda agadi** (Before the safety car came out) - The accident *triggered* the safety car, it didn't happen before it.
*   **D: Piquet indhan ko laagi gaye pachhi** (After Piquet refueled) - While Piquet is mentioned as the cause, the text says other cars were refueling, not specifically Piquet at that moment.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, tala diekaa madhye kaslai anweshak le vishwaas gare bhandaa kam samaya laagyo?","Correct answer is **C: Farak prajati haru bich prajanan**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that researchers believed it would take a *long time* for hybridization (prajanan) between the local Darwin's Finch and the foreign Seed Finch to occur. However, the study found new species developed in just two generations. This means the researchers underestimated how *quickly* hybridization could happen, thus it took less time than they believed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prajati haru ko nirman (Species formation):** The passage says new species *did* develop quickly, it doesn't say species formation itself was faster than expected.
*   **B: Prajati haru ko reporting (Species reporting):**  The passage is about the *development* of species, not the reporting of them.
*   **D: Prajati haru ko bikaas (Species evolution):** While related, the specific point is about the time taken for *hybridization* to lead to new species, not the overall evolutionary process.



"
Tala dieko madhye kun anweshak haru report garenan?,"The correct answer is **B: Bikaas prakriyaa ko awadhi** (The duration of the evolutionary process).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...anweshakharule naya prajatiharu matra dui pustama wiksit bhaeko bataeka chan, yadyapi sthaniya Darwin Finch, Geospiza Fortes ra videshi Siudi Finch, Geospiza Konerostrisbichko prajananka karan yass prakriyama dherai samay lagne vishwas garieko thiyo."" This directly addresses *how long* the researchers found the new species took to develop (two generations) – contradicting previous beliefs about a longer timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naya prajati kaha nirman bhaeko thiyo** (Where the new species were formed) - The passage states ""equadoriali galapagos tapuma"" (in the equatorial Galapagos). This isn't what the researchers *reported on* - it's the *location* of the research.
* **C: Naya prajati ko naam** (The name of the new species) - While the passage mentions Darwin Finch and Siudi Finch, it doesn't give the *names of the newly formed species*.
* **D: Prajanan maa samlagna bhaekaa chara** (Birds involved in reproduction) - The passage mentions the specific birds involved (Darwin Finch and Siudi Finch) but isn't the main *report* of the study.



"
Cowparade kaha aayojana hune chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest sahar maa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yo kalatmak ghatana pani bukharesta city halko ek abhiyanko hissa ho..."" which translates to ""This artistic event is also part of an initiative in Bucharest city...""

Therefore, Cowparade is being planned in Bucharest.



"
Tala die madhye kun wakya le cowparade lai sahi rupmaa varnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo ek kala sambandhi karyakram ho jun garmi maa dakshin purvi europe bhari aayojana garinchha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yo kalatmak ghatana pani bukharesta city halko ek abhiyanko hissa ho, jasle romaniali rajdhaniko chhawilai ek rachanatmak ra rangin mahanagarka rupma ferry suru garna khojdacha."" This translates to ""This artistic event is also part of Bucharest City Hall's effort to transform the image of the Romanian capital into a creative and colorful metropolis."" and ""Yo sahar june ra agastako bichma wishwako sabaibhanda thulo sarvajanik kala karyakram, coupred ayojana gurney dakshin purvi europema pahilo hunechha."" translates to ""This summer, between June and August, the world's largest public art program, Coupred, will be organized for the first time in Southeastern Europe.""

* **Option C** accurately reflects both the artistic nature of the event (""ek kala sambandhi karyakram"") and its timing and location (""jun garmi maa dakshin purvi europe bhari aayojana garinchha"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions ""creative"" (rachanatmak), it's not the primary focus of describing Couparade. It's describing the *event* itself, not just its creative aim.
* **B:** The passage states Bucharest City Hall is *organizing* it, not that they *built* it.
* **D:** While true that it's the largest, this doesn't fully *describe* what Couparade *is*. It's a characteristic, not a definition.



"
Ke karan le rus le II-76 ko prayog banda garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek durghatna (An accident)**.

The text states: ""October 7 maa udan garda euta engine alaggio, jasma kunai chotpatak lagena. tyo durghatanapachhi rusle II-76s ko udan kehi samay pratibandhit garyo."" (On October 7th, an engine failed during flight, with no injuries. After that accident, Russia temporarily banned the flight of II-76s).

Therefore, the reason Russia stopped using the II-76 was due to the accident. The other options are mentioned in the text but aren't the *reason* for the flight ban.



"
II-76 bhaneko ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: hawai jahaz** (airplane).

The text explicitly states ""Aircraft irkatskatarf badhiraheko thiyo"" (An aircraft was heading towards Irkutsk) and then refers to ""II-76 rusi ra sobhiyat duwai senako euta pramukh ghatak"" (II-76 Russian and Soviet military component). This clearly indicates II-76 is a type of aircraft/airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pandubbi** (Submarine) - This is a watercraft, not an aircraft.
*   **B: Tanky** (Tank) - This is a land vehicle, not an aircraft.
*   **D: rel** (Train) - This travels on rails, not through the air.



"
The Simpsons ko lekhakiya toli lai kasle niyukta gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Sun 1989 maa unle brooks ra groningasanga da simpasanharu sirjana garna maddat gare ra uni karyakramko pahilo lekhan tolly niyukta garna jimmewar thee."" This translates to ""In 1989, he helped create the Simpsons with Brooks and Groening and was responsible for appointing the program's first writing team.""

Therefore, **Groening** was the one responsible for appointing the writing team for The Simpsons.



"
Fluke anusar kasle unlaai sakaratmak tippani ra hausala praaan gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Purush ra mahila dubai vyakti haru**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...duwai mahila ra purushharule unilai pathai dherai sakaratmak tippani ra protsahanko karan uni yass n pugeki chin."" This directly translates to ""both women and men gave a lot of positive comments and encouragement, and it wasn't enough.""

Therefore, both men and women were the ones providing the positive feedback and encouragement.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, kehi manis haru mahila le ke bare nabolun bhanne chahanthe?","The correct answer is **A: Purush vyakti haru**.

Here's why:

The passage states that women were pressured to take birth control medication even when they didn't see it as a medical necessity. The phrase ""dabauna kehile gareka prayasharu asafal bhaeka thee"" (pressure to take it even when not needed proved unsuccessful) implies women didn't want to discuss the matter *with men* (purush vyakti haru).  They felt pressured, suggesting the pressure came from men, or from a system influenced by men.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Medical kharcha (Medical expenses):** The passage doesn’t mention concerns about the cost of medication.
*   **C: Mahila swasthya (Women's health):** While women's health *is* a topic, the question is what they didn't want to *discuss*.
*   **D: Fluke:** ""Fluke"" is mentioned at the beginning, but the passage isn't about avoiding discussion *of* fluke, it's about avoiding discussion *with* someone.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun graha pinda sabai bhanda gatishil chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Prithvi**.

The passage states: ""“…yasako name prithvi ho”, stophanle tape."" which translates to ""...its name is Earth,"" Stephen said.  It also says that this body (Earth) shows greater speed than Titan. Therefore, Earth is the most speedy planet mentioned in the passage."
Kun graha pinda maa paaradarshi taral padaartha bhaeka kholaa ra taal pahichaan garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

* **The text mentions ""ek matra grahako nikaya jasle titenbhanda badhi gatishilta dekhaunchha ra yasako name prithvi ho"" (a planetary body with more activity than Earth, named Prithvi/Earth).**  This is a reference to Titan, a moon of Saturn, which is the only moon in our solar system known to have a dense atmosphere and stable bodies of liquid on its surface (lakes and seas of methane and ethane).  The text describes it as being able to see ""kankadharu wa gum"" (mist or fog), referring to the dense atmosphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Brihaspati (Jupiter):** Jupiter is a gas giant, and while it has atmospheric features, it's not primarily known for surface liquids or being particularly ""transparent.""
* **C: Surya (Sun):** The Sun is a star, not a planet or moon, and is extremely hot and doesn't have liquids on its surface.
* **D: Shani (Saturn):** Saturn *has* Titan as a moon, but Saturn itself is a gas giant and doesn't have transparent liquids on its surface.



The passage is describing Titan's unique characteristics - a planetary body with a dense, hazy atmosphere and liquid lakes/seas."
Yea madhye kun nishkarsha pwaankha patta laageko karanle gariekaa hoinan?,"The correct answer is **D: Praya dinosaur haru ko pwankh thiyo bhanne pushti**.

Here's why:

The passage states the initial theory *didn't* support the idea that many dinosaurs had feathers, and that fossils don't generally preserve feathers. The research *provides details* (like color and structure) that suggest feathers *were* present, but it's the initial lack of support for widespread feathering that's being addressed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Janawar ko pwaankha ko rang (Animal feather color):** The passage *does* discuss feather color (faded above, carotenoids), so this wasn't a lack of information.
*   **B: Pwaankha udaan ko laagi prayog bhaekaa thienan bhanne bujhai (Understanding if feathers were used for flight):** The passage mentions the structure of feathers suggests potential use in flight *or* temperature regulation, meaning understanding around this was being developed.
*   **C: Pwaankha ko bikaas baare jankari (Information about feather development):** The passage specifically talks about barb and barbule development, providing insights into feather evolution.



"
Dinosaur ko pwaankha maa ke thiena?,"The correct answer is **A: Barbules**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""barbs ra barbules namak pankhetaka any gunharu hune bhaekale khojkartaharule rachis sambhawatah yea dui gunharubhanda pachhi wiksit bhaeko hunu parchha"" (researchers suggest rachis likely developed *after* these two features - barbs and barbules). This indicates barbules were present in dinosaur feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rachis:** The passage states the rachis likely developed *after* barbs and barbules.
*   **C: wayaska pwaankha (adult feather):** The passage discusses the finding being *different* from an adult feather, suggesting it wasn't a fully developed adult feather.  It was a juvenile dinosaur's tail feathers.
*   **D: Fika rang ko talako bhag (pale underside):** While the passage mentions color variations, it doesn't specifically state that a pale underside was *in* the feathers, but rather the color of the feathers overall (fusro khairo ra taltira fikka pahenlo).



"
Tala die madhye ZMapp ko bare maa kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo antibody harule baneko hunchha (This antibody is made)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ZMapp is an *antibody cocktail* (""Euta antibody kakatel...ZMapp""). It doesn't say it's *made* - it's a *combination* of antibodies.  The other options are directly supported by the text:

* **B:** The passage says it shows ""come labh bhaeko sanket gareko cha"" (some benefit has been indicated) but doesn’t definitively stop death. (""mrityuko rokathamma khojebhanda come labh bhaeko sanket gareko cha."")
* **C:** The passage explicitly states it was used as a control in the PALM trial (""PALM parikshanma, ZMappley niyantranka rupma cam garnu bhaneko matlab..."")
* **D:** The passage says studies suggest its benefits are less than initially hoped (""Adhyan haru le dekhaeka chhan ki yasko faida suru maa soche bhanda kam hunchha"").



"
Tala madhye kun wakyale PALM parikshan lai sahi rupma varnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Euta niyantrak ausadhi aru tin upachar haru sanga tulanaa garieko thiyo, jun madhy ek zmapp thiyo** (It was compared with a control drug and three treatments, one of which was ZMapp).

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""PALM parikshanma, ZMappley niyantranka rupma cam garnu bhaneko matlab vaigyanikle yasalai adharbhut rupma prayog garera teen any upcharharusanga tulana gare.""  This translates to: ""In the PALM trial, the meaning of using ZMapp as a control was that scientists fundamentally experimented with it by comparing it with three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adhyan haru le dekhaekaa chhan ki yasko faida suru maa soche bhanda badhi hunchha** (Studies have shown that its benefit is greater than initially thought) - This is a general statement about potential benefits, not a description of the PALM trial itself.
* **C: ZMapp parikshan ko aadharbhut rupma prayog garieko thiyo** (ZMapp was fundamentally experimented with) - While true, this doesn't fully describe the *trial* - it focuses only on ZMapp's role. The key is the comparison.
* **D: Yo vidhyaman awastha ko upachar garna prabhavkaari hune dekhieko thiyo** (It was seen to be effective in treating the existing condition) - The passage states that no drugs are *clearly* effective for treatment, and the trial is looking for evidence of effectiveness.



"
Anweshak harule naya chip kaha sabai bhanda mahatwapurna hune bichar garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kam aaya bhaekaa muluk haru** (Low-income countries).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dhani deshharuko tulanama come aya bhaeka deshharuma cancer, kshayarog, hiv ra maleriako pahichan lagauna sakha bhanera stan cancer jasta rogharubata baanchne darr adha hune pramukh anweshakharuko bhanai cha."" This translates to: ""Leading researchers believe this can identify cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria in low-income countries compared to wealthy countries, potentially saving lives from diseases like breast cancer.""

Therefore, the researchers believe the chip is most important for use in low-income countries.



"
Diagnostic upakaran ko nirmaan garna kun bidhi ko prayog garine chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Manak inkjet printer**.

Here's why:

The passage states the device is created ""prayog garera sambhawatah lagbhag ek americi centko lagatma nirman garna sakinchha **manak inkjet printerharu**"". This directly states that standard inkjet printers are used in the manufacturing process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: EK americi cent** - This is the *cost* of production, not the method.
*   **C: Print garna milne chip haru** - These are a *component* of the device, not the manufacturing method itself.
*   **D: Aru diagnostic upakaran haruh** - This is too broad and doesn't specify the method used for *this* device.

"Anuchhed anusar, landform sambandhi kun siddhanta le chandrama maa bhaugolik gatiwidhi hune sanket garchha?","The correct answer is **A: Chandrama bistarai sankuchit hudai chha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists found landforms indicating the moon has been ""gradually weakening"" and ""shrinking"" (bistarai kamjor hundai gaeko cha). The fact that these landforms appear as if the entire moon fell apart and are only minimally eroded suggests this shrinking is the cause. This shrinking *is* a geological process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ti landform haru dherai agadi banekaa thie:** While the landforms are old, the passage focuses on *why* they are the way they are, pointing to a current (or recent) process of shrinking.
*   **C: Chandrama ko satahama kewal nyunatam matra maa landform haru rahekaa chhan:** The passage doesn't say landforms are minimal, it says they look minimally *eroded*.
*   **D: Landform haru bharkharai matra baneka thie:** The passage doesn't focus on *how* the landforms were made, but on what their state indicates about the moon's geological activity.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, abhiyogko bela sama ke kura hune chhaina?","The correct answer is **A: Aru tippani**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Samagra abhiyojanka lagi jimmewar croun officele, patrakarharulai sanket gareko cha key abhiyogko belasamma come say come kunai tippani garine chhaina.""  This directly translates to ""The Crown Office responsible for the entire prosecution has signaled to journalists that they should not make any further comments during the trial.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Photo prakashan:** The passage discusses the concern about photo publication potentially creating bias.
*   **C: Pratakshya darshi ko praman bare bahas:** The passage mentions the lack of direct witness evidence.
*   **D: Lekh prakashan:** The passage mentions the publication of a professor's writing, showing that *some* publication is occurring.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, kun sealer haru kaa lagi vidhyaman samasya hoina?","The correct answer is **A: Charam mausami awastha (Extreme weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pisaune barafka sathasathai charm mausamka karan uddhar karyama badha purryairaheko cha."" This translates to ""Rescue efforts are being hampered by melting snow along with extreme weather conditions."" This clearly identifies extreme weather as a contributing factor to the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hiun ko matra (Amount of snow):** The passage specifically says the *amount* of snow is getting worse for the sealers.
* **C: Hiun ko motai (Thickness of snow):** The passage also specifically states the *thickness* of snow is getting worse for the sealers.
* **D: Paglieko hiun (Melted snow):**  The passage directly mentions melting snow *causing* problems.

Therefore, extreme weather conditions are the only option *not* directly identified as a worsening issue for the sealers in the provided text. They are the *cause* of the difficulties, not a result of the current situation.



"
"Hiun baahek, uddar karya lai kele asar gariraheko chha?","The correct answer is **B: Mausam ko awastha (Weather conditions)**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) directly states:** ""Pisaune barafka sathasathai charm mausamka karan uddhar karyama badha purryairaheko cha.""  This translates to ""The rescue operation is being hindered by melting snow and bad weather.""
* The passage also mentions the worsening of the pack ice, impacting conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aapurti ko abhav (Lack of supplies):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about a lack of supplies.
* **C: Sahayog ko abhav (Lack of cooperation):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of cooperation.
* **D: Sealer haru (Seals):** The passage doesn't discuss seals or their impact on the rescue.

Therefore, the weather is clearly identified as a hindering factor in the rescue operation.



"
Roberts le kun biswas ko pramarikaran garna bata pachhi hate?,"The correct answer is **B: sarvochcha adalat ko nirantar aadesh haru ko mahatwa (the importance of continuous orders of the Supreme Court)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""dohoryae ra unle sarvochcha adalatko lagatar nirnayako mahatwama jode die"" (repeats and adds importance to the continuous decisions of the Supreme Court). This clearly indicates he's prioritizing the precedent set by the Supreme Court's past rulings.  He uses *Roe v Wade* as an example of a ""deshko basobas bhaeko kanuna"" (established law of the country) and reinforces its significance by referencing the court's consistent decisions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Muddha haru ko bahas garne naitiktaa (the ethics of debating issues)** - While ethics are *part* of the overall context, Roberts isn't directly prioritizing the ethics of debate itself.
*   **C: Jiwan ko suruwat (the beginning of life)** - The passage mentions this as *a* question related to abortion ethics, but Roberts isn't taking a position *on* when life begins. He's avoiding answering that question.
*   **D: Gopaniyata ko adhikar (the right to privacy)** - The passage states Roberts believes *Roe* was based on a right to privacy, but he's not prioritizing the *belief* in privacy rights, he’s prioritizing the court’s rulings.



"
Roberts le kun bisay bahas garna anaitik hune mahasus gare?,"The correct answer is **B: Roe viru wade ko nirnay**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""denies and refuses to say he believes when life begins when considering the moral question of abortion, arguing it would be unethical to comment specifically on the potential outcome of *Robertsle sambhawit kesharuko* [Roberts' potential cases]. However, he reaffirms his earlier statements and adds importance to the consistent rulings of the Supreme Court. He further affirms that *Roe* decision relied on the inherent right to privacy that he believes in.""

This directly indicates Roberts felt discussing the potential outcome of cases related to abortion (and thus, *Roe v. Wade*) would be unethical. The passage frames this reluctance around the sensitive nature of the *Roe v. Wade* decision itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sarvochcha adalat kaa adesh haru (Supreme Court orders):** He *reaffirms* the importance of Supreme Court rulings, he doesn't consider discussing them unethical.
*   **C: Nihit gopaniyata ko adhikaar (Inherent right to privacy):** He *believes* in this right, making it unlikely he’d consider discussing it unethical.
*   **D: Mudda kaa vivaran haru (Details of the case):** The passage is about the ethical consideration of discussing potential *outcomes*, not simply the details of cases.



"
Prakash kaa dui kiran haru kaha chamkirahekaa chan?,"The correct answer is **A: Aakash tarfa** (Towards the sky).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ratbhar akashatirko binduma prakashka dui bimharu lagaieka thee.""  This translates to ""Throughout the night, two beams of light were applied to the points in the sky."" 

Therefore, the light beams were shining towards the sky. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sahar bhari** (Throughout the city) - The text specifically mentions points *in the sky*, not generally throughout the city.
* **C: Pahilo jet ko laxya ma** (On the target of the first jet) - While a jet is mentioned, the light beams are not directed *at* the jet's target.
* **D: Smarak park ko bich maa** (In the middle of the memorial park) - The text mentions construction *near* a memorial park, but the light beams aren't shining *in* it.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, ukta sthan maa naya gagan chumbi bhawan haru kahile banne chhan?","The correct answer is **D: Nirman karya jari chha** (Construction work is ongoing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kshetrama yatayat kendra ra madhya bhagma smarak parksahit naya paanch gaganchumbi bhawanharuko **nirman karya jari raheko cha**."" This directly translates to ""The construction work of five new skyscrapers, including a transportation center and a central memorial park, **is ongoing**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Din ko bich maa** (In the middle of the day) - The passage doesn't mention *when* the buildings will be built, just that construction is happening *now*.
*   **B: Bihan 8:46 baje** (At 8:46 AM) - This refers to a specific time related to something else (a signal), not the building construction.
*   **C: Raat ratai** (Nighttime) - While the passage mentions lights at night, it doesn't say the buildings are being built at night.



"
Kun jankaari le janauchha ki “saat didibahiniharu” gufa hun bhanera?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapkram maa bhinnata** (Temperature variations).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Infrared taswirharule ratka tapakram bhinnataharu ra dinle tiniharu sambhawatah gufaharu hun bhane dekhaunchha."" This translates to ""Infrared images show temperature variations at night and during the day they potentially appear as caves.""  

This directly links the *temperature variations* as evidence suggesting these structures are caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gufa ko praveshdwar ko wyas** (Diameter of the cave entrance): While the passage mentions the diameter, it doesn't say this *proves* they are caves. It's a descriptive feature.
*   **C: Bhaugolik sarvekshan** (Geological survey):  The USGS geologist is *reporting* on the findings, not that the survey itself identified them as caves.
*   **D: Prithvi kaa gufa haruko photo** (Photos of Earth's caves): The passage refers to infrared images, not standard photographs.



"
“Saat didibahiniharu” ko thermal kriyakalap kasari awalokan garinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared chitra haru** (Infrared images).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Infrared taswirharule ratka tapakram bhinnataharu ra dinle tiniharu sambhawatah gufaharu hun bhane dekhaunchha.**"" (Infrared images show nighttime temperature variations and during the day potentially indicate they are caves). This directly links the observation of the ""Saat Didibahiniharu"" to infrared imaging and their thermal behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jamin maa gahira khalda haru** (Deep holes in the ground) - While the structures *might* be holes, the passage focuses on how their *thermal behavior* is observed, not just their physical form.
* **C: Gufa haruko wyas** (Diameter of caves) - The passage mentions the diameter, but it's not *how* they were observed or their thermal activity studied.
* **D: Prithvi kaa gufa haruko sarwekshan** (Survey of Earth's caves) - This is too broad. The passage is about a specific observation using a specific method.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, aropit bare kun wakya sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **C: Usko jatiyata bare adhikaari haru laai thaha chha** (The authorities know his ethnicity).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Usako name adhikariharuma ajhai pani agyat cha, tathapi uniharulai thaha chhaina key uni uighur jatiya samuhako ek sadasya hun."" This translates to: ""His name is still unknown to the authorities, and they don't know if he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group."" 

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Usle akraman ko samaya maa gadi ko prayog garyo** (He used a car during the attack):  ""Tyo manisle kathit rupma wisfotak padarthaharu bhaeko teen-pangre sawarilai bhidma lagyo."" (The man rammed a three-wheeled vehicle reportedly containing explosives).
* **B: Uslaai bisfotak padartha padkaeko aarop chha** (He is accused of planting explosives):  The passage states he's suspected of making the bomb and is being held.
* **D: U ghaite bhaena** (He didn't escape): ""bum wishfotbata ghaite banaepachhi pakrau garieko thiyo."" (He was caught trying to escape from the explosion).



Therefore, option C is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
Aakraman baare adhikaari harule kun jaankaari ko pusti garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **B: Aaropit ko jaatiyata (The perpetrator's ethnicity)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...though his name is still unknown to officials, they do not know whether he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group."" This directly indicates that officials are investigating the *suspect's ethnicity*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kohi sahayogi haruko pahichaan (Identification of any accomplices):** The text doesn't mention any accomplices.
* **C: Aakraman pachaadi ko kaaran (The reason behind the attack):** The text doesn't state anything about the motive for the explosion.
* **D: Aaropit ko naam ra thar (The perpetrator's name and address):** The text explicitly says the name is unknown.



"
Ellis park maa kun toli le match khelne chhan?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa ra Australia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Springboxle australiasanga yass shringkhalako antim khel arko hapta johannesburgko alys parkma khelne bhaniyeko cha.""  ""Springboks"" is another name for the South African rugby team, and ""Australia"" is directly mentioned as their opponent in the final match at Ellis Park (which is also known as Alys Park in Johannesburg).



"
Springboks le arko match kaha khelne chhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Springboxle australiasanga yass shringkhalako antim khel arko hapta johannesburgko alys parkma khelne bhaniyeko cha."" This translates to ""Springboks will play their last match of this series against Australia next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""



"
Mission ko samaya maa antariksha station le kasto samasyaa ko saamana garyo?,"Correct answer is **B: Gyroscope raakhne**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Antariksha station missionma gyroscope haraeka bhae..."" (The space station lost a gyroscope during the mission...). This directly indicates the problem the station faced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Thruster baat sahi duri kaayam raakhne** - The text says the thrusters were used to *maintain* distance, not that there was a problem with them.
*   **C: Jet ko sakriyata** - The text mentions ""Rusi bhumi niyantranle jetharu sakriya garyo"" (Russian ground control activated the jets), this was a solution, not the problem.
*   **D: Samanya uchai lai puna prapta garne** - The text says the station returned to normal, but doesn't mention a problem with altitude specifically.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, antarikshya station ko mission ke laxya thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: Haraaeko gyroscope paaune** (To find the lost gyroscope).

Here's why:

The passage states the space station maintained its attitude *even after losing a gyroscope*. This implies a mission goal related to the gyroscope – likely to recover or compensate for its loss. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage mentions coordinating with thrusters, but not getting *close* to them.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention any kind of spacewalk or travel.
*   **D:** The passage says Russian ground control *activated* jets, but doesn't say this was the mission's goal.



"
Tala die madhye mudda baare kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukta mudda AOL ko mukhya kaarayala bhaeko rajyamaa chalaieko thiyo** (The case was filed in the state where AOL's headquarters is located).

Here's why:

The passage states AOL *was* an internet service provider and *was* the target of the lawsuit. It doesn't say the lawsuit was filed specifically in the state where AOL's headquarters were located. The passage focuses on the fact that it was one of the first cases to use the CAN-SPAM Act to fight unwanted bulk email.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Abhiyog lagaaiyo** (Charges were filed) - The passage states ""mudda chalaieko thiyo"" which translates to a lawsuit/charges were filed.
*   **C: Mudda maa spam email sambandhi vidhaan ko prayog garieko thiyo** (The lawsuit involved the application of spam email legislation) - The passage clearly states the CAN-SPAM Act was used in the case.
*   **D: AOL laai mudda lagaaieko thiyo** (AOL was sued) -  The passage indicates AOL was the target of the lawsuit (""prayogkartaharuka melboxharuma apratyashit vitaranbata roknaka lagi prayog garieko vishwas prapta bhaeko yo pahilo patak ho"" suggests someone sued to stop unwanted distribution of emails to AOL users' mailboxes).



"
Tala dieko wakya madhye kunle mudda laai sahi rupmaa varnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL maathi apratyashit vitawaran sambandhi mudda lagaaieko thiyo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yo pahilo patak ho... bulk email, arthat spyamlai prayogkartaharuka melboxharuma apratyashit vitaranbata roknaka lagi prayog garieko vishwas prapta bhaeko yo pahilo patak ho."" This translates to ""This was the first case... used to prevent unsolicited distribution (spam) in the inboxes of users, a case that gained credibility."" This directly relates to AOL (as mentioned at the beginning of the passage) facing an issue regarding unwanted, unsolicited distribution (spam).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mudda maa dui mukhya internet sewa pradayak samlagna thie:** The passage only mentions AOL.
* **C: Mudda 2003 maa lagaaieko thiyo:** While the passage mentions the law was applied in 2003, it doesn't state the *case* itself was filed in 2003.
* **D: AOL mudda abhiyog ko surwaat gareko thiyo:** The passage doesn't say AOL *started* the lawsuit, it says AOL was the subject *of* the lawsuit (being challenged to prevent spam).



"
"Anuchhed anusar, Vidal le tin season aghi kun club baata khelna suru gareka thie?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""28-warsha-umerka vidal sebhilabata teen sijanaghi barsama samel bhae."" (28-year-old Vidal joined Sevilla three seasons ago.)

Therefore, Vidal started playing for Sevilla three seasons ago.
"
Vidal le Barca kaa laagig kati khel kheleka chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly states: ""...Bhidalle clubka lagi 49 khelharu kheleka thiye."" which translates to ""...played 49 games for the Barcelona club.""

The question (Q) asks: ""Vidal le Barca kaa laagig kati khel kheleka chhan?"" which translates to ""How many games did Vidal play for Barca?""

Therefore, the answer is 49.



"
Match maa virodhi toli kun thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states: ""aitbar bolonia viruddha yojana garieko khel aghadi..."" which translates to ""before the planned match against Bologna..."". This directly identifies Bologna as the opposing team.
"
Jarque kina hotel maa basekaa thie?,"The correct answer is **A: Unko abhyas thiyo** (He was practicing).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jark dinko suruwatma italyko kabharasianoma pri-season prashikshanko abhyas gardai thee."" which translates to ""Jark was practicing pre-season training in Italy.""  The sentence then continues to say he stayed in the hotel *because* of this practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unko pre-season baithak thiyo** (He had a pre-season meeting) - The text mentions practice, not a meeting.
* **C: Unko aitabar match thiyo** (He had a Saturday match) - He was preparing *for* the match, not having it at that moment.
* **D: Uni Bolonia sanga prasikshan gardai thie** (He was training with Bologna) - The text doesn't specifically state he was training *with* Bologna, just that the game was *against* Bologna.



"
Jakarta bhubhautiki agency le kina chetawani jaari garena?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhukampa ko awashyak pariman pugena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bhukampale 6.5 parimanko awashyakta pura nagarekale sunamiko chetawani zari garine chhaina.""  This directly translates to ""The earthquake did not meet the 6.5 magnitude requirement to issue a tsunami warning to the city.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sunami ko kunai jokhim thiena** - While it's *true* there's no tsunami threat, the passage explains *why* no warning was issued - the magnitude wasn't high enough, not simply that there was no risk.
*   **B: Baasinda harumaa\\ dar paida nagarna** - The passage doesn't mention avoiding panic.
*   **C: Sthaniya vyapar mathi asar huna baata jogauna** -  The passage does not talk about the impact on local businesses.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, bhukampa le ke garyo?","The correct answer is **B: sunami ko jokhim** (the risk of a tsunami).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states there is **no tsunami warning** issued and **no tsunami threat**, even though there was an earthquake. It's discussing the *lack* of a tsunami risk.
*   **A: Daraaeka sthaaniya haru** (Scared locals) - While locals might be scared, the passage doesn't focus on that.
*   **C: Chetawani jaari gariyo** (A warning was issued) - The passage states the opposite - no warning was issued.
*   **D: 6.5 pariman** (Magnitude 6.5) - This is just the earthquake's magnitude, not *what* the earthquake did.

Therefore, the earthquake's effect, as discussed in the passage, is related to the absence of a tsunami risk."
Yea madhye kunle surya ra aru sabai taraa haruko kriyakalap laai utprerit garchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ujyaalopana ra plasma ko bahaav** (Radiation and plasma flow).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""pranalima sabai taraharuko kriyaklap uniharuko ujyalopan, parikramanle chalit bhaeko pae..."" - meaning all stars' activity is driven by their radiation and rotation.  Plasma flow is closely tied to radiation as it *is* the radiating material.
* **Rossby number and magnetic reversals (B and D)** are *results* of stellar activity and the underlying mechanisms, not the drivers themselves. They describe *how* activity manifests, not *what causes* it.
* **Rotation and radiation (C)** is close, but doesn't include the crucial element of the plasma itself being part of the activity. It's the flow of plasma (heated and energized by radiation) that's key.

Therefore, radiation (ujyalopana) and the flow of plasma are the fundamental drivers of activity in the sun and other stars, according to the passage.



"
Taaraa ko rossby sankhyaa kasari nikaalinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ujyaalopana ra parikramaa (Luminosity and Rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Rasbi sankhya (Rossby number) jati sano hunchha, chumbakiya utkramanko sambandhama uti come sakriya tara."" (The smaller the Rossby number, the more active the star in relation to magnetic evolution.)  It then implies that luminosity and rotation are key factors influencing this number.  A star's rotation speed and how much light it emits (luminosity) directly contribute to calculating its Rossby number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Plasama ko bahaav ko matra (Amount of plasma flow):** While plasma flow is important in stars, the passage doesn't directly link it to the Rossby number calculation.
* **C: Kriyakalap ko star (Level of activity):**  Activity *is a result* of the Rossby number, not a component used to *calculate* it.
* **D: Chumbakiya reversal ko matra (Amount of magnetic reversal):** Magnetic reversals are related to stellar activity and potentially the Rossby number, but aren't the direct inputs used to *find* the Rossby number.



"
Sarwekshan gare madhye kati pratishat manis le Australia turunta ganatantra banne maa samarthan gare?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 pratishat**.

The text states: ""Janamatka atyadhik parinamharuma, sarwekshan garieka **29 pratishatle** sambhawa bhaesamma chhito astrelia ganatantra hunuparne vishwas garchhan...""

This directly translates to: ""Among those surveyed, **29 percent** believe Australia should become a republic immediately.""
"
Julie Gillard ko anusar Australia kahile ganatantra bannu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Rani Elizabeth dritiya ko sasan pachhi**.

Here's why:

The text states that Julia Gillard campaigned on the belief that Australia would become a republic *after* the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended. This is a direct connection between her views and the Queen's role.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jati sakdo chado** - The text doesn't suggest an immediate timeframe.
*   **C: Kahile bannu hudaina** - The survey results show significant support for a republic, even if it's not overwhelming.
*   **D: Sanghiya chunaaw pachhi** - While Gillard brought it up during the election, the text explicitly links the change to the Queen's reign ending, not simply after the election.



"
Kun sanstha kaanuni anusandhan muni raheko chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Komen foundation**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Comen foundationka praakta Lesley Aunale bhane ki sanghale ek naya niyam apanaeko cha jasle kanuni anusandhanma raheka sanghaharulai anudan wa koshle sammanit gurney anumati dindaina."" This directly translates to ""Lesley Aunale of the Komen foundation announced that the organization adopted a new rule that would not honor or allow grants or funds to collections remaining in legal research.""

Therefore, the Komen foundation is the organization involved in the legal research. While the Parliamentary Energy and Commerce Committee (Samsadiya urjaa tatha banijya samiti) and the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee (Nirikshan tatha anusandhan upasamiti) are mentioned, they are investigating *the Komen foundation's* actions, not conducting the research themselves.  ""Suniyojit abibhaawakatwa"" (Planned advocacy) is a *subject* of the issue, not the organization doing the research.



"
Cliff stearns kun samiti kaa pramukh hun?,"The correct answer is **A: Samsadiya urjaa tatha banijya samiti**.

The text states: ""...june sadan urja ra wanijya samitiko chhata antargat cha."" which translates to ""...under the umbrella of the House Energy and Commerce Committee."" and ""...Pratinidhi Cliff Sternsdwara sanchalit..."" which means ""Representative Cliff Stern is conducting..."".

Therefore, Cliff Stern is associated with and conducting work within the House Energy and Commerce Committee.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, Swiss mahila laai ke bhaena?","The correct answer is **C: Unlaai 5 jana le youn durvyavahar gare** (She was sexually assaulted by 5 people).

Here's why:

The text states: ""sahayak inspector general D K aryale bhane, """"hamile swiss mahilalai **balatkar gurney** paanch wyaktiharulai pakreka chhaun..."""""".  ""Balatkar gurney"" directly translates to ""sexually assaulted"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unko chorieko saamaan bhetiyo** (Her stolen belongings were recovered) - While the laptop and phone were recovered, this doesn't answer *what happened to the Swiss woman*.
*   **B: Unko mrityu bhayo** (She died) - The text does not mention her death.
*   **D: Unko phone ra laptop chori bhayo** (Her phone and laptop were stolen) - This is a fact mentioned, but not *what happened to the woman*.



"
2007 maa kun company lai taiwan digo puraskar pradan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tar sun 2007 maa ASUSlai ganatantra chainaka karyakari yuandwara taiwan digo puraskar pradan garepachhi..."" which translates to ""Then in 2007, ASUS was awarded the Taiwan Digo Award by the Republic of China Executive Yuan...""

Therefore, the answer is ASUS.



"
ASUS Eee PC bhaneko ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: laptop**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...laptop computerka u bazar amul ruple farak ra parivartan hunechha"" (and the laptop computer market experienced significant changes and transformations). It also mentions ASUS Eee PC in the context of a computer award. This strongly indicates that the ASUS Eee PC is a type of laptop.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Smartphone:** Smartphones didn't have the same market impact as laptops in 2007, and the passage doesn't suggest it's a phone.
*   **C: Tablet:** Tablets were not widely available or popular in 2007.
*   **D: Pager:** Pagers were already becoming obsolete in 2007.



"
Haraeko hulaki kagjaat haru ko lagi ko jimmewaar thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Hulaki karmachari** (Postal employees).

Here's why:

The passage states the postal office (""hulak karyalaya"") apologized for not distributing the New Year's cards as expected, and that over 600 pieces of postal paper (including the cards) were found hidden. This directly implies the responsibility lies with the postal employees who were supposed to deliver the mail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Obanazawa kaa basinda haruko ek samuha** (A group of Obanazawa residents): The residents were the *recipients* of the cards, not responsible for them going missing.
* **C: Euta keta** (A child):  While a child found the cards, they weren't responsible for the initial loss or hiding of them.
* **D: Sanchar madhyam** (Media): The media simply reported the news; they weren't involved in the loss of the mail.



"
Anuchhed anusar haraaeka kaagjaat ko laagi kasle kshyama maage?,"The correct answer is **D: Obanazawa hulak karyalaya** (Obanazawa Post Office).

Here's why:

The text states: ""hulak karyalayale janata ra midiasamu afno mafi zari garyo"" which translates to ""the post office apologized to the public and the media.""  This directly indicates the post office is the one seeking forgiveness for the lost documents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sthaniya basindaa (Local residents):** The residents *received* the apology, they didn't offer it.
* **B: Ukta keta (The mentioned Keta):** Keta is a person who lost the postcards, but the text doesn't say they apologized.
* **C: Sanchar madhyam (Media):** The media *received* the apology along with the public. They didn't offer it.



"
Del potro le aafno kaadh ko vishay kahile sambodhan garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Dosro set maa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dell potrole dosro setma suruwati faida lieko thiyo, tar yasalai pani 6-6 maa pugepachhi tai break chahieko thiyo."" This translates to ""Dell should start the second set with an advantage, but if it reaches 6-6, then a break is needed.""

Therefore, Dell needs to address his injury during the second set, specifically *before* potentially needing a break if the score gets to 6-6.  The passage is planning for a situation *within* the second set.



"
Pahilo tai break ko natijaa ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Murray pahilo set maa haare**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Duwai manisharule setma pratyek sewa rakhera murele tai breakma pahilo set gumae."" This translates to ""Both players served each point, but Murray lost the first set after a tie-break.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Del potro le chot ko kaaran le haare:** The passage doesn't mention Del Potro losing due to injury.
*   **C: Murray dosro set maa vijay bhae:** The passage only mentions the possibility of Del Potro starting the second set with an advantage, not that Murray won it.
*   **D: Del potro dosro set maa vijay bhae:** The passage doesn't state Del Potro won the second set.



"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhae anusar, ko visesh gari virami ko samparka maa aekaa thie?","The correct answer is **B: Baalbaalika (Children)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"kehi vidyalaya umerka bachchaharu biramisangko sampark bhaeko bhanera chinaieko cha bhanera az hamile patta lagayaun.""""  This translates to: ""The Governor also said, 'We have now discovered that some schools have identified children who have been in contact with migrants.'""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions *children* being in contact with migrants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Governor:** The Governor is the one *reporting* the contact, not *being* in contact.
*   **C: Texus kaa adhikaari haru (Texas officials):** While officials are involved, the passage specifically identifies *children* as those with contact.
*   **D: Sthaniya nagarik (Local citizens):** The passage doesn't mention local citizens being in contact with migrants; it focuses on children in schools.



"
"anuchhed anusar, safltapurak accordian bajauna kun kuralai sahi sallaha maanidaina?","The correct answer is **A: thap awaz ko laagi, ajha jod sanga key thichhnuhos** (For the tapping sound, you don't need to press the keys too hard).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""yaad garnuhos pianoma jasto atirikta awajko lagi kunjiharulai dherai balle thichnu awashyak chhaina."" which translates to ""Remember, you don't need to press the keys too hard like on a piano to get extra sound.""  This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: tapai ko sahanshakti bachauna anawashyak chaalharu lai nyunatam rakhnuhos** (Minimize unnecessary movements to conserve your stamina) - This is stated in the first sentence.
*   **C: haat lai aaraam didaa sur milauna khyaal garnuhos** (Keep your hands relaxed and coordinate them well) -  The passage mentions keeping your hands ""shanta"" (calm/relaxed).
*   **D: thap awaz praapta garna tapailey sanchalan garnu bhayeko bellows ko gati badhaunuhos** (To get a tapping sound, you should increase the speed of the bellows you operate) - This is stated directly in the passage.



Therefore, option A is the only one that's *not* a suggestion made in the passage for successful accordion playing."
"jaba tapai le accordian bajaanu hunchha, nimna madhye kunley awaj badhauna maddat grachha?","The correct answer is **C: cum dawab**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Accordianma, atirikta awaz prapta garna, tapain **thap dawab** wa vegka sath belojko prayog garnuhunchha.""  This translates to ""In the accordion, to get extra sound, you use **thap dawab** or fast bellows movement.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thap gati** - While ""thap"" (tapping) is mentioned, ""gati"" (speed) isn't the specific technique described for increasing volume.
*   **B: thap bal** -  ""Bal"" means force, but the passage doesn't mention force as the key to extra sound.
*   **D: aunla ko cum chaal** - This doesn't make sense in the context of increasing volume on an accordion and isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
television maa bhayeko tasbirharuko kinaara kina kateko hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Purai screen tasbirle bharna ko laagi** (To fill the screen with the picture).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that overscan is a problem where televisions are made to cut off the edges of the picture (""tapainle tibhima dekhnuhune sabai chijma simana katauti..."") so that the image *fills* the entire screen (""Yo chhawile purai screen chhopdacha bhane sunishchit garnako lagi banaieko ho"").  This is the core definition of overscan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: subtitle hernako lagi** (To see subtitles) - While sometimes overscan *can* cut off subtitles, that's a consequence of the problem, not the reason for it.
* **C: anya dhachama saral rupaantaran garnako lagi** (To simplify conversion in other formats) - The text doesn't mention format conversion as the cause.
* **D: dherai muni bhayeko subtitle haru kaatna** (To cut off too many subtitles) - Similar to A, this is a result *of* overscan, not the reason for it.



"
"anuchhed anusar, film lai dibhidi dhachaa ma rupaantaran garda nimna madhye kun chaahi samasya bhogna sakinchha?","The correct answer is **D: kinaara katna** (cutting off the edges).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that overscan causes the edges (mathi, tala, chheuharu - top, bottom, sides) of the image to be cut off. This happens because televisions are often made to display a slightly larger image than the actual screen, resulting in those edges being hidden. The passage also mentions ""borderharu pani sambhawit rupma katinechhan"" (the borders are also likely to be cut off).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: euta tasbir junley purai screen bharinna** (a picture that doesn't fill the whole screen): Overscan actually *tries* to fill the whole screen, but ends up cutting off parts in the process.
*   **B: aamshik rupma subtitle katna** (partial cutting of subtitles): While overscan *could* cut off subtitles, the passage doesn't specifically mention this.  It focuses on the overall image edges.
*   **C: euta tasbir junley purai screen bharchha** (a picture that fills the whole screen): This is what overscan *attempts* to do, but fails at due to the cutting off of edges.



"
british gadh kaha awasthit thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: borderntown**.

The text states: ""General zone cadwalderle kunai pani sudridhikaranlai rokna **boardentaunako britis gadhko** viruddha dhyan bhadkauka lagi akraman suru garthe."" This directly translates to General Cadwalder started the attack to distract the British fort at **Borderntown** from reinforcing.

Therefore, the British fort was located at Borderntown."
haat ley lekhiyeko masyauda maa kasko hastaakshyar thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: charles thomson**.

The text states: ""July 4 maa congressle yasalai grahan garepachhi congresska adhyaksha zone hancock ra **sachiva charles thamasanle** hastakshar gareko hastalikhit abhilekh..."" (After Congress adopted it on July 4th, the handwritten document signed by the President of Congress, Zone Hancock and **Secretary Charles Thomson**...)

Therefore, Charles Thomson signed the handwritten document."
"nimna sthan haru madhye, dunlap broadside antim maa kaha aayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: london**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""tyasko euta pratilipi august 10 maa london pugyo."" (A copy of it reached London on August 10th). This directly indicates that a Dunlap Broadside arrived in London.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York:** While a copy was read to the troops in New York, the text doesn't say a Dunlap Broadside *ended up* there.
*   **B: Danalapko chhapakhanama:** This is where they were *printed*, not where they ultimately reached.
*   **D: Independence Hal:** The first public reading happened *at* Independence Hall, but the text doesn't state a Broadside remained there.



"
karnal stark ko sipahiharu kaha awasthit thee?,"The correct answer is **D: parkhaalko agadi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gridle wa starkle barka aghadi karib 100 feat (30 meter) co hissedari rakhe..."" This directly translates to ""Gridley and Stark placed a share of their men forward about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the *parkhal*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uttar tira, parkhal sangai** - While they are near the northern shore and the *parkhal*, the text specifies they are *in front of* the *parkhal*, not alongside it.
*   **B: paniko kinaara ko tat maa** - The text doesn't say they are on the shore itself.
*   **C: peninsula ko uttarpurvatira** - This is where the initial fortification was, but the specific positioning of Stark's men is described as being *ahead* of the *parkhal*.



"
"anuchhed anusar, stark ko manis harule uniharuko parkhal kahiley badhaae?","The correct answer is **B: niyamit wyakti haruley ghocho paar gare pachhi** (after the regular people crossed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gridle wa Starkle barka aghadi karib 100 feat (30 meter) co hissedari rakhe ra aadesh die key jabasamma niyamit wyaktiharu paar gardainan, tabasamma kasaile ago laga.""  This translates to ""Gridle and Stark placed a share of about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of their enclosure and ordered that no one set fire until the regular people crossed.""

This clearly indicates they fortified their enclosure *after* the regular people had crossed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jaba upaniweshwadi harule thap fauj bolaae** (when the colonists called for troops) - The text doesn't mention building the enclosure in response to the call for troops.
*   **C: kam chhaal bhayeko bela** (when work was scarce) -  This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: jaba senaharu tainaath huna thaale** (when soldiers were deployed) - The text focuses on Stark’s men building the enclosure, not on other soldiers being deployed.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye chinko sabai bhanda himsaatmak yug kun thiyo?","The correct answer is **D: teen raajyaharuko yug** (The Three Kingdoms period).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yea awadhima sinhasanka lagi yuddha gariraheka dherai kulinharubichma bhayankar yuddha bhayo. Teen adhirajya prachin chinko itihasma euta raktapatpurna yug thiyo jasma cy'anko mahaan darbarma uccha sthanko asanka lagi ladda hajaraun manisharuko mrityu bhayo.""  This translates to: ""In this period, many nobles fought desperately for power, and the Three Kingdoms period was a bloody era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battles for high positions in the courts.""

The passage directly identifies the *teen raajyaharuko yug* (Three Kingdoms period) as a ""raktapatpurna yug"" (bloody era) in ancient Chinese history. The other options are not specifically highlighted as particularly violent in this text.



"
"anucched anusar, ghumante charanma jaada sena kamila koloni barey ke satya ho?","The correct answer is **C: uniharule banaune gunda 17 din pachhi parivartan garchhan** (They change the built squads after 17 days).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yea pratyek ghumante hinsatmak wyawahar wa marchharu lagbhag 17 dinasamma rahanchhan."" (Each of these wandering violent behaviors or marching groups stays for about 17 days).  This means the groups, or ""gundas"" they build, are rotated/changed after approximately 17 days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uniharu raati gunda banauchhan** (They build squads at night) - The passage doesn't mention *when* they build the squads, only *that* they do.
* **B: uniharusanga khaanaako aapurti kam chha** (They have a limited food supply) - The passage says food shortages *trigger* the colonial actions, it doesn't say the groups themselves are food-limited.
* **D: uniharu dinma maarch garchhan** (They march during the day) - The passage simply says they ""march"" without specifying a time of day.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye kun vaakyale ghumante charanko bela sena kamila koloni haruko gunda banauney baaniko yathartha jhalkauchha?","The correct answer is **B: uniharu gunda nabanai 17 din maarch garchhan** (They march for 17 days before becoming bandits).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pratyek ghumante hinsatmak wyawahar wa marchharu lagbhag 17 dinasamma rahanchhan."" This translates to ""Each wandering violent behavior or marchers stay for about 17 days.""  This directly indicates the marching *precedes* becoming bandits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uniharule raati gunda banauchhan** (They become bandits at night) - The passage doesn't mention *when* they become bandits, only the duration of the march.
* **C: uniharule harek din gunda parivartan garchhan** (They change bandits every day) - This is the opposite of what the passage says. It mentions a period of 17 days with the same group.
* **D: uniharule tyo charanko laagi uhi gunda prayog garchhan** (They use the same bandits for that journey) - The passage doesn't suggest they re-use the same bandits, but rather that new ones are formed during each marching period.



"
nimna madhye bahya sanket upasthit hunda pani ke jaari rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **C: jaivik ghadiharu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jaivik ghadiharu bahya dhakkako anupasthitima samet swatantra-chalne chakralai nirantarta dine atmanirbhar dolakharu hun."" This translates to: ""Biological clocks, even in the absence of external cues, are self-dependent oscillators that continuously run the cycles.""

This directly indicates that biological clocks continue to operate *even when external cues are absent*.  The question asks what continues even *with* external cues present, and the biological clocks will *definitely* continue functioning then.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: antarjat chakraharu (internal cycles):** While related to biological clocks, the passage doesn't explicitly state these *continue* even with external signals. They are *influenced* by them.
*   **B: Awadhik layaharu (rhythmic layers):**  These are described as responding *to* external cues, not functioning independently of them.
*   **D: awalokan gariyeka layaharu (observed layers):** This is too vague and doesn't relate to the passage's core point about self-sustaining rhythms.



"
kun naamle phenotypic lakshan pradarshan garne wyaktiharuko barnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **D: polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** directly means exhibiting different forms or types. The passage states that individuals who show a *lot* of variation in a specific trait are considered polymorphic.
* **Monomorphic** means exhibiting only one form - the opposite of what the question is asking about.
* **Jivaharu (organisms)** and **prajatiharu (species)** are too broad to describe individuals showing variation in traits.

Therefore, the passage explicitly defines **polymorphic** as describing individuals displaying different phenotypic characteristics.
"
kunai nischit kshetramaa basobaas garney jivaharuko lagi nimna madhye kun chaai sahi naam ho?,"The correct answer is **B: janasankhyaa**.

Here's why:

* **Janasankhyaa (Population)** directly translates to ""population"" and the definition provided in P explicitly states: ""Janasankhya bhaneko kunai nirdishta bhaugolik khetra bhitraka wishishta prajatiharuka jiwaharuko sangraha ho"" - meaning a population is a collection of individuals of specific species within a defined geographic area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:**  Refers to individuals *within* a population being similar in characteristics, not the population itself.
* **Prajatiharu (Species):**  Is a broader classification than just the individuals living in a specific area.
* **Polymorphic:** Describes variation *within* a population, meaning individuals have different forms of a trait.



"
nimna madhye kun prakritima adharit paryatan gatiwidhiko udaharan hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: vigyaan sangrahalaya bhraman garnu** (visiting a science museum).

Here's why:

* **Prakritima adharit paryatan** (nature-based tourism) specifically focuses on experiencing *natural* environments and wildlife.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: jharanama hike garnu** (hiking to waterfalls) - This is directly related to experiencing a natural environment.
* **B: jangali fulharuko photo khichhnu** (taking photos of wildflowers) - This involves observing and documenting nature.
* **C: vigyaan sangrahalaya bhraman garnu** (visiting a science museum) -  A science museum is a *man-made* environment focused on learning about science, not directly experiencing nature.
* **D: kutrim jhinga ko prayog garera machha marnu** (fishing with artificial bait) - While fishing can be controversial, it *is* an activity taking place in a natural environment (a body of water) and interacting with wildlife. It’s mentioned in the prompt as an example of ""machha marney"" (fishing).

Therefore, visiting a science museum doesn't fit the definition of nature-based tourism provided in the text."
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye yatayat pranaliko aadhar kun ho?","The correct answer is **B: niji kar** (personal work).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yatayat satalma sabaijana kunai naa kunai rupma niji karma adharit yatayat pranalisanga jodieka chan ra tyasko samarthanma chan.""  This translates to: ""On the transportation surface, everyone is connected to a work-based transportation system in some way or another and supports it.""

Therefore, the foundation of the transportation system, according to the passage, is based on personal work (where people need to go *to* work).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: karya gantawya** (work destination) - While work destinations *influence* travel, they aren't the foundational basis of the system itself.
*   **C: ek sthir jaivik kshetra** (a stable biological sphere) - The passage contrasts the current carbon economy with the biological sphere that supported human development, implying the transportation system isn’t *based* on it, but rather contributing to its disruption.
*   **D: manav vikas** (human development) -  Human development is a broader concept that the transportation system supports, but isn’t its core basis.



"
nucleus ko parikrama garney kanharu maa kun prakar ko charge hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: nakaratmak charge**.

The text clearly states: ""electronharuma nakaratmak vidyutiya charge hunchha"" (electrons have a negative electric charge). And the text also says electrons orbit the nucleus. Therefore, the particles orbiting the nucleus have a negative charge.
"
nucleus kun kanharu bata baneko hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: proton ra neutron**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nucleusma dui kanharu hunchhan - neutron ra protonharu."" (The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.)"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye panch bit binary nambar ko udhaharan kun ho?","सही उत्तर **C: 10010** हो।

*   पञ्च बिट (5-bit) बाइनरी नम्बरमा पाँचवटा 0 वा 1 को मानहरू हुन्छन्।

अब विकल्पहरू हेरौं:

*   **A: 1010** - यो चार बिटको बाइनरी नम्बर हो।
*   **B: 12001** - यसमा 2 को संख्या छ, जुन बाइनरी कोडमा हुनु हुँदैन।
*   **C: 10010** - यो पाँच बिटको बाइनरी नम्बर हो।
*   **D: 110101** - यो छवटा बिटको बाइनरी नम्बर हो।

यसै कारणले, विकल्प C (10010) पाँच बिटको बाइनरी नम्बरको उदाहरण हो।"
binary nambar lai ke pani bhaninchha?,"The correct answer is **A: bits**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...yea ankaharulai jodi ankaharu - wa computer jargan prayog garnaka lagi bits bhaninchha.""  This directly translates to ""These numbers - or computer jargon - are used as bits.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: maanharu (values):** While binary numbers *represent* values, the passage specifically names the units themselves.
* **C: jargan (jargon):**  The passage uses ""jargan"" to *describe* bits, not as what binary numbers *are*.
* **D: rupharu (form/shape):** This doesn't relate to what binary numbers are called.



"
nimna madhye kun laai vidyarthi bloggin gko prathamik faida bhanera anuchhed maa ullekhit garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **B: samakakshi haru bata alochanako kami (lack of feedback from peers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *positive* effects of blogging.** It states blogging helps improve grammar and writing (A), increases awareness of the world around them (C), and encourages active learning and critical thinking, ultimately leading to better education and the ability to form their own opinions (D).  The passage highlights that *audience* presence (including peers) leads to improvement.
* **The passage does NOT mention a *lack* of peer feedback as a benefit.** In fact, the opposite is implied – that audience interaction (which would include peer feedback) is *helpful*.

Let's break down why the other options are mentioned in the text:

* **A: wyakaran ra lekhan kshamata maa sudhar (improvement in grammar and writing skills):** The first sentence directly states this: ""Vidyarthiko lekhan blagharule pani sudharna maddat garchhan.""
* **C: aafno waripari ko watavaran bare thap sachetana (awareness of their surrounding environment):**  The quote ""Bloggingle """"vidyarthiharulai uniharuko warparko vishwaka barema thap samajhdar hoon badhya parchha."""" is a direct reference to this.
* **D: gyan arjan garne ichhyama bridhi (increase in desire to learn):** The passage states blogging encourages active learning and expands education beyond the classroom.



"
nimna madhey bloggingko kun pakshya laai vidyarthiko lekhan kshamata sudhaar garne prerak bhanera ullekh gariyeko chha?,"The correct answer is **A: internet maa bhaekaa samagriharu mathi lagatar jawaf diera** (constantly responding to materials found on the internet).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Blagko uchit upayogle """"vidyarthiharulai thap vishleshanatmak ra alochanatmak banna sashakta gardacha; **internet samagriharulai sakriya rupma jawaf diera**, vidyarthiharule aruko lekhanko sandarbhama afno sthiti paribhashit garna sakdachhan ra sathai vishesh vishayaharuma uniharuko afnai drishtikonko ruparekha banauna sakchhan"""" (Orabhek, 2002).""

This directly links responding to internet materials with improved analytical and critical thinking skills, which contribute to better writing ability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alochana bata jogine tibra ichhyaa** (strong desire from thought/reflection) - While the passage mentions reflection, it doesn't frame this desire as the *driving* force for improvement.
* **C: srotaaharuko ruchi kayam rakhne** (keeping the audience interested) - Audience response is mentioned as a factor that *leads to* improvement, but isn’t the initiating factor.
* **D: sahakaarya garne aawashkyata** (the necessity of collaboration) - Collaboration is mentioned as encouraged by blogging, but not directly linked to improving writing skills *initially*.



"
vidyarthiharuko lagi nimna madhye kun atulyakalik sanchar ko faida hoina? ,"The correct answer is **B: dinko kunaipani samayma prashikshak haru sanga aamne samne pahunch** (reaching instructors face-to-face at any time of the day).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that asynchronous communication *allows* students to ask questions at any time, but it doesn't replace the ability to have direct, face-to-face interaction.** In fact, the passage contrasts it with sitting in a traditional lecture.  Asynchronous communication provides flexibility, but doesn't *offer* constant, immediate face-to-face access.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits mentioned in the passage:

* **A: srotko rupma internetko prayog** (using the internet as a source) - The text explicitly states it allows learners access to information at any time.
* **C: karya garna ko lagi lachilo samay** (time flexibility for work) -  The passage says it gives students control over the pace of learning and offers ""time constraints"" – meaning flexibility within those constraints.
* **D: gati niyantran** (pace control) -  The text states it ""allows students and instructors to control the pace of information.""



"
"anuchhed anusar, vidyarthiharuko lagi atulyakalik sancharko nimna madhye kun pakshya lachilo hudaina?","The correct answer is **C: prashikshan sambandhi samagri (training materials)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses:**
    * **Sikne gati (learning pace):**  ""Afnai vegma cam garna yasale vidyarthi ra nirdeshkiya jankariko gati niyantran garna anumati dinchha"" - This directly states students can control the pace of learning.
    * **Karya garney samay (time to work):** ""tyahanko lachilo cam gurney samayako sambhawanama thorai samayaka pratibandhaharu raheka chan"" -  It mentions flexibility in work/study time, but with some limitations.
    * **Internetko prayog (use of the internet):** ""Internet ra world wide webko prayogbata sikneharulai yasale hear samay jankariko pahunch garna anumati dinchha"" -  Clearly states the internet is available for learning.

* **The passage *does not* discuss:**
    * **Prashikshan sambandhi samagri (training materials):**  While it talks about *access* to information, it doesn't mention anything about the *content* or materials themselves being different or asynchronous.  The passage focuses on *how* and *when* students access information, not *what* information is available.



Therefore, the asynchronous communication doesn't offer any benefit regarding the type or variety of training materials available."
anuchhedma madhyayugin mahalsanga sambandhit ke ullekhit garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: kalko khadal (lime pit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions ""kalko khadalbata uthne darko gandha lieko kura samjhan sajilo cha""** - It's easy to imagine the stories carrying the smell rising from the lime pit. This directly refers to a physical feature associated with the imagined medieval setting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ghoda chadhi gardai judhnu (fighting while riding horses)** - The passage explicitly mentions ""jadumaya ghoda chadheko pratima"" (statues of magical horses) and the sounds of battles.
* **C: shishtata (elegance/refinement)** -  The passage mentions ""bhoj ra artharko palako shishtatako chitraharulai"" (images of the elegance of meals and the courts of the wealthy).
* **D: yoddha (warriors)** - The passage mentions the sounds and smells of battles, implying the presence of warriors.



Therefore, the only element *not* directly mentioned in connection to medieval palaces is the lime pit."
nimna madhye kun kura anuchhedmaa mahal bhangnawshesh haru maajh utpanna huney gandha waa aawaj ko rupmaa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: bhoj**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **Yuddha (war):** ""Hazaar warsha purano bhagnawasheshharuko bichma khada bhae pani dherai phile bhaeka ladaiharuko awaz"" - sounds of battles in the ruins.
    * **Dar (fear):** ""kalko khadalbata uthne darko gandha lieko kura samjhan sajilo cha"" -  a smell rising from a pit, evoking a sense of fear.
    * **Khur (hoofbeats):** ""jhandai dhungaharuma khurharuko awaz"" - sounds of hooves on stone flags.

* **Bhoj (feast)** is mentioned in the first sentence as part of the imagery (""bhoj ra artharko palako shishtatako chitraharulai""), but there's *no* mention of any sounds or smells originating *from* the feasts or related to the ruins in the context of the question. The feasts are part of the imagined medieval scene, not a source of sounds or smells within the ruins themselves.

Therefore, **C: bhoj** is the only option that doesn't have a corresponding mention of a sound or smell related to the ruins in the passage.

nimna madhye kun Kirby Maksaloi mahalko sahi varnan hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: mahalko baklo parkhaalharu lord hestings dwara anurodh garieko thiyo** (The outer walls of the palace were requested by Lord Hastings).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the walls were built to withstand long-term attacks**, not specifically *requested* by Lord Hastings. While he initiated the construction, the purpose of the walls was defensive, not a personal request for a specific design.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: nirmanko samayma desh shanta vatavaranma bhayeko karan tesh lai nyunatam killabandhiko aawashyakta paryo** (The country was peaceful during construction, so it required minimal fortification) - The text states the country was relatively peaceful and only needed protection against roaming bandits.
* **C: tyo samay awadhiko lagi tesh mahalko nirman swabhavik thiena** (At that time, building such a palace was natural for Awadh) -  The passage implies Awadh was prosperous (""tyas awadhika lagi wishishta"") making a grand building logical.
* **D: tyo lamo ra nirdhaarit akramanharu jhelna banaieko thiyo** (It was built to withstand long and determined attacks) - This is directly stated in the passage (""Yasaka vishal chamakdar jhyal ra patlo parkhalharu lamo samayasamma nirdharit akramanko pratirodh garna saksham thienan."").



"
nimna madhye kun nirman viseshta lai anucchedma warnan gariyeko samay awadhi dauran ma Kirby Maksaloi mahalko aakriti ko lagi aswabhavik maninthiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: akramanharu jhelna sakne banayeka jag** (a place built to withstand attacks).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yasaka vishal chamakdar jhyal ra patlo parkhalharu lamo samayasamma nirdharit akramanko pratirodh garna saksham thienan."" This translates to ""It has vast, glittering walls and shallow trenches capable of resisting attacks for a long time."" This directly describes the castle's structure being designed for defense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thula jhyalharu (large walls):** While the passage mentions walls, it's not the *defining* or unusual feature described in relation to the time period. Walls are common in castles.
* **C: kehi mahalharu vanda kam killabandhi (less fortified than some castles):** The passage doesn't suggest it was *less* fortified; it highlights its defensive capabilities.
* **D: patalo parkhalharu (shallow trenches):** Trenches are *part* of the defense, but not the core, unusual design element mentioned in the context of the time period when simple protection from roaming bandits was sufficient. The passage highlights its capacity to *withstand long sieges*, implying a more sophisticated defense than just trenches.

"anucched anusaar, nimna madhey kun agu season ko lagi tayari gariraheko dhawak ko lagi sabai bhanda badhi lavdayak hunchha?","The correct answer is **D: sharir ko mathillo bhag ko kasharat garna jimkhana ko faida uthaunu** (Taking advantage of gym workouts for the upper body).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Sharirko mathillo bhagko lagi wyayamko sath sanyukta, jadoko samayama hune kehi cross country daud daud sijanka lagi uttam tayari ho."" This translates to: ""Combined with exercise for the upper body, a few cross country runs during the off-season are excellent preparation for runners.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: garmi ma cross country daud ko abhyash garnu** (Practicing cross country running in the summer) - The passage doesn't emphasize practicing in the summer.
*   **B: talim garda gati sudharnama dhyan dinu** (Focusing on improving speed during training) - While speed is mentioned as important for a half-mile run, the passage emphasizes endurance and patience.
*   **C: teen minute samaya lai sudharnu** (Improving a three-minute time) - The passage mentions a two-minute time for a half-mile, but doesn't focus on improving a specific three-minute time.



"
"anucched anusar, nimna madhye kun ek pratham shreniko adha-mile dhaawak ko lagi sabai bhanda badhi awashyak hunchha?","The correct answer is **B: gati bhanda badhi dhairyata badhaunu** (building more endurance than speed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Awashya pani ek pratham shreniko adha-mile, ek manis jasle dui minetma pura garna sakha, usama uchit gatiko matrako hunu parchha, **tara dhairyataka sabai khataraharuma shodhan garinu parchha.**"" 

This translates to: ""It is necessary for a first-rate half-mile runner, someone who can complete it in two minutes, to have a certain amount of speed, **but endurance must be sought in all circumstances.**""

Therefore, the passage emphasizes that endurance (dhairyata) is *more* important than speed (gati) for a top-level half-mile runner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: jado yamma cross country daud abhyash garnu** (practicing cross country running often) - While cross country training is helpful, the passage doesn't state it's the *most* crucial thing.
*   **C: dui minute bhitra daud sakaunu** (being able to run within two minutes) - This is a requirement for a *good* runner, but the passage says endurance is needed *beyond* just being fast.
*   **D: dhairyata bhanda gati badhaunu** (increasing speed more than endurance) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.



"
"athlete ko laagi, nimna madhye kun paushtik abhyashharu marfat matra prapta garna sakidaina?","The correct answer is **D: samanya tandurusti (general health)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that proper nutrition *can* significantly impact the *overall health* of young athletes. It doesn't say nutrition *solely* provides general health.  General health is influenced by many factors beyond just nutrition (sleep, genetics, stress management, etc.).  The passage focuses on nutrition's impact on *performance* and *enjoyment* *through* improving overall health.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sudhar bhaeko pradarshan (improved performance)** - The passage explicitly states nutrition helps improve performance.
* **B: ananda ma briddhi (increase in enjoyment)** - The passage says nutrition helps increase enjoyment of the sport.
* **C: utkrishta pradarshan (excellent performance)** - The passage says proper nutrition provides excellent performance.



Therefore, nutrition contributes *to* general health but doesn’t *solely* provide it."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye kun tarika tanneri ethlete ko lagi afno khelkudma ananda lina ko laagi sujhav garieko chhaina?","The correct answer is **B: lagatar utkrishta starma pradarshan garnu (continuously performing at an excellent level)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that good nutrition, hydration, and a balanced energy level *help athletes improve performance and *increase enjoyment* of the sport*.  It focuses on *how* to enhance enjoyment through these practices.

*   **A: sahi poshan abhyash garnu (following a correct nutrition plan)** - The passage explicitly mentions this helps enjoyment.
*   **C: prabhawkari rupma pani piunu (drinking water effectively)** - The passage explicitly mentions this helps enjoyment.
*   **D: swastha urja santulan rakhnu (maintaining a healthy energy balance)** - The passage explicitly mentions this helps enjoyment.

However, the passage doesn’t say that *continuously performing at a high level* is a way to *increase* enjoyment. While athletes might *feel* good when performing well, the passage emphasizes the *practices* that lead to both better performance *and* enjoyment, not just the performance itself.  It's about the process and foundation, not solely the outcome.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, madhya duree dhawak le kina mahango samagri kinna saknechhan?","The correct answer is **D: kum mahango samagri bare galat dharanaharu chhan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that there's a lot of misinformation about the necessary equipment for middle-distance running. Manufacturers push products, but many don't *actually* have a significant impact on performance. Runners prioritize buying these things even when they don't provide real benefits. This implies they're buying things based on incorrect beliefs about what's necessary (i.e., misconceptions about expensive equipment).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yo uniharuko vyaktigat rojai ho (this is their personal preference)** - The passage suggests it's not simply preference, but a result of being misled.
*   **B: yashka pramanit faida haru chhan (they have proven benefits)** - The passage explicitly says many products *don't* have significant benefits.
*   **C: yas le uniharuko pradarshan ma thulo asar garnechha (this has a big impact on their performance)** - The passage states the opposite – that many items have little to no real impact.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, euta madhyam duree daudlai ke chahinchha?","The correct answer is **C: ekdum thorai samagriharu** (very few materials).

Here's why:

The passage states that middle-distance running is *relatively* inexpensive, and there's a misconception about needing a lot of equipment. It says manufacturers try to sell things that don't actually have a huge impact on performance. This implies you don't *need* much to participate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dherai samagriharu** (a lot of materials) - The passage directly contradicts this.
*   **B: euta sthapit ethlethic prishthabhumi** (an established athletic background) - The passage doesn't mention anything about needing prior experience.
*   **D: dherai paisa** (a lot of money) - The passage explicitly states it's a *sasto khel* (inexpensive game).



"
anawik chumbakiya anunad kasley patta lagayo? ,"The correct answer is **C: bloch ra purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI anawik chumbakiya anunad (NMR) bhanne bhautik vigyan ghatanama adharit cha, june 1930 co dashakma **felix bloch (stanford vishwavidyalayama karyarat) ra Edward Purcell (harward vishwavidyalayabata)** dwara patta lagaieko thiyo."" 

This directly translates to: ""MRI is based on the physical phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by **Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell**.""



"
chikitsakiya imaging pratidhwaniko lagi kahile pahilo patent pradan gariyo? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Char warshapachhi patent pradan gariyo, june mri ca kshetrama zari garieko wishwako pahilo patent thiyo.""  This means a patent was granted four years *after* 1970, when Remand Damadian began using magnetic resonance for medical diagnostics. 1970 + 4 = 1974.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1977** - This is when the first ""full-body"" MRI scanner was completed, not when the first patent was granted.
*   **C: 1930** - This is when NMR was discovered, not when medical imaging patents began.
*   **D: 1970** - This is when the initial work on medical imaging using MRI began, but the patent was granted later.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, aruharuko sharirik karyaharu ko vyakhya garnako lagi manavharu sanga kun kura ko baliyo bujhaai hunuparchha?","The correct answer is **D: bodh (understanding/cognition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding others' minds is crucial within the ability to solve the potential ambiguity of physical actions. It uses the example of seeing someone working on a car - you need to *understand* (bodh) their intention (are they stealing it, or fixing their own?) to interpret their actions correctly.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: iccha (desire/will):** While desire motivates actions, the passage focuses on *interpreting* the actions, not knowing what the person *wants*.
* **B: abhipraaya (opinion/view):** Opinions are subjective. The passage is about forming a reasoned understanding, not simply having a viewpoint.
* **C: viswas (belief/trust):** Belief might play a role, but the core requirement is understanding *why* someone is doing something, not blindly believing them.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, abhipraya bujhnale manisharulai ke garna maddat gardachha?","The correct answer is **A: sharirik karyaharu pachhadiko anishchitata hataunu** (to remove uncertainty about physical actions).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""हमिलै शारीरिक कार्यहरूको सम्भावित अस्पष्टतामा यसले समाधान गर्न अनुमति दिन्छ।"" (This allows us to resolve the potential ambiguity of physical actions.)  The example of seeing someone rummaging through a car illustrates this - understanding intent helps clarify *what* is happening (is it theft, or just looking for something?).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: icchaharu anuman garna** (to guess desires) - While understanding intent *can* help infer desires, the passage focuses on understanding *actions* first.
* **C: anya manavharulai kunai nirnaya bina hernu** (to look at other people without judgment) - The passage is about *interpreting* actions, not simply observing without judgment.
* **D: aruharuko man padhnu** (to read other people's minds) - The passage states understanding others' *intent* is important, not literally reading their minds. It's about inferring what someone is thinking based on their behavior.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhey kun ai ko mukhya uddeshyako sahi saramsha ho?","The correct answer is **D: karya swachalan (task automation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AI research *includes building machines that automate tasks requiring intellectual behavior*.  It then lists examples of these tasks: control, planning, scheduling, diagnosis, answering questions, handwriting recognition, speech and pattern recognition. All these examples are about automating things humans typically *do*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yojanna (planning):** Planning is *an example* of what AI can do, but not the overarching goal.
* **B: swar pahichan (speech recognition):** Speech recognition is *one specific capability* of AI, not its main objective.
* **C: anusuchi banaune (scheduling):**  Scheduling is another *example* of a task AI can automate, not the central aim.

The passage emphasizes the broader concept of creating machines capable of *automating tasks* that require intelligence. Therefore, ""task automation"" is the most accurate summary of AI's primary purpose according to the text.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye kun sanga AIlai praya jodera herinchha?","The correct answer is **A: grahak sewa** (customer service).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""grahak nidan ra prashnaharuko utter dine kshamata"" which translates to ""ability to diagnose customers and answer their questions"". This directly relates to customer service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: yojana ra anusuchi banauney** (planning and scheduling) - While mentioned, it's just *one* example, not the primary association.
*   **C: vigyan katha** (science fiction) - The passage describes AI as a real field of computer science, not a fictional one.
*   **D: hastalekhan pahichan** (handwriting recognition) -  Again, it's an example given, but not the main focus of AI's applications mentioned in the context of how it's being used.

The passage emphasizes AI's ability to perform tasks requiring intellectual behavior, and customer service/diagnosis is a prominent example provided.

"anucched anusaar, nimna madhye kun abhisaran soch dhancha bhayeko vyaktiko gun ho?","The correct answer is **A: euta samasyako laagi dherai wata thik jawafharu pahichan garnu** (being able to identify multiple correct answers for a problem).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **""Puratanbadi sochai dhancha samasya samadhan gurney praidhiharu hun...vibhinna vicharharu wa kshetraharulai ektabadha garchha.""** This translates to: ""Traditional thought frameworks are problem-solving tools...bringing together different ideas and fields."" This suggests the ability to consider multiple perspectives.
* **""tapain dui jawafharu matra sochnu hunchha, jasko earth sahi wa galat.""**  This indicates the framework expects *two* possible answers, acknowledging multiple solutions (even if only one is ultimately correct).
* **""...tarkik soch hunchha, dhanchaharu samjhan saksham hunchhan, samasyaharu samadhan garchhan ra vaigyanik parikshanharuma kam garchhan.""**  This describes someone who is logical, understands frameworks, solves problems, and does scientific experimentation - all skills that would involve evaluating *multiple* potential solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: euta samasyako lagi naya tarikaharu lagu garnu** (trying new methods for a problem) - While innovation is good, the text emphasizes *identifying* correct answers, not necessarily *creating* new ones.
* **C: samasyaharu samadhaan garnako lagi samaya linu** (taking time to solve problems) - The text doesn't focus on the *speed* of problem-solving, only the method.
* **D: dhanchaa haru ko yaad garnu** (remembering frameworks) - While understanding frameworks is important (as the text states), *remembering* them isn't the core skill.  It's applying them to identify solutions.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhey kun abhisaran sochai manasikta ko kendrabindu manidaina?","The correct answer is **B: afno samaya line** (one's own timeline).

Here's why:

The passage describes puratanbadi sochai (traditional thinking) as a problem-solving approach that *integrates* different ideas and fields. It emphasizes:

*   **Gati (speed):** Quick thinking
*   **Turk (logic):** Reasoning
*   **Shuddhata (purity):** Accuracy/precision
*   **Tathyaharu pahichan garnu (identifying facts):** Recognizing facts
*   **Jankari sankalan (information integration):** Compiling information
*   **Sahi jawaf khojne (finding the right answer):**  There is one correct answer.

These all point towards a structured, logical, and fact-based mindset.  A ""samaya line"" (timeline) or personal history doesn't directly relate to this core set of characteristics.  The passage focuses on *how* one thinks, not *where* one comes from in terms of personal experience or history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: euta matra sahi jawaf chha bhanney bujhai (understanding there is only one correct answer):** This is explicitly mentioned as a key characteristic.
*   **C: tathyaharu pahichan garnu (identifying facts):** This is a core component of the described thinking process.
*   **D: jankari batulnu (information integration):**  Also a key element, as stated in the passage.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunlai micro-abhiwyakti bhanera manindaina?","Correct answer is **D: budhi aula le sanket garnu**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on *micro-expressions* as brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal true emotions, especially when someone is trying to conceal them. The examples given are:

*   **A: boliraheko bela aru tira hernu** (looking away while speaking) - This is a subtle behavioral cue.
*   **B: aakhibhou khumchaunu** (frowning eyebrows) - This is a classic facial expression.
*   **C: chitochito aakha jhimkaunu** (briefly blinking eyes) - This is a very quick, often unconscious movement.

However, **D: budhi aula le sanket garnu** (signaling with intelligence) is not a physical expression. It refers to cognitive ability and not a momentary facial display of emotion. It's an abstract concept rather than a micro-expression.

The passage draws a parallel between human behavior interpretation and animal abilities (like dogs) but it doesn’t mention intellect as a micro-expression. Therefore, it is the odd one out."
nimna vaakya madhey kun micro-abhiwvyakti ko shahi vyakhya hoina?,"सही उत्तर **C: boli lagayat anuharko bhaav ko wyakhya garincha** हो।

किनभने:

*   **Micro-expressions** भनेको व्यक्तिले आफ्नो भावनाहरू लामो समयसम्म लुकाउन नसकी, केही milliseconds को लागि अनुहारमा देखाउने क्षणिक भावहरू हुन्। यो विशेष गरी झूठ बोल्दा वा भावनाहरू दबाउन खोज्दा देखिन्छ।
*   प्रश्नमा, C विकल्पमा ""boli lagayat anuharko bhaav ko wyakhya garincha"" भनिएको छ, जुन micro-expressions को परिभाषा होइन। यसले सामान्य रूपमा बोलीको साथ आउने भावनाहरूको व्याख्याको बारेमा बताउँछ।

अन्य विकल्पहरू micro-expressions को बारेमा सही कुरा बताउँछन्:

*   **A:** भिडियो रेकर्डिङहरूले micro-expressions को अध्ययनमा महत्त्वपूर्ण विकास ल्याएको छ।
*   **B:** micro-expressions को सही व्याख्याले व्यक्तिले झूटो बोलिरहेको छ कि छैन पत्ता लगाउन मद्दत गर्छ।
*   **D:** यसले इमानदारीको मूल्याङ्कन गर्न मद्दत गर्न सक्छ, किनकि micro-expressions ले वास्तविक भावनाहरू प्रकट गर्न सक्छन्।"
nimna madhey punarutthanle ko karan le kun kura ajha mahatwapurna bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **C: path samjhana (understanding the text)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sarma, punarutthanle sikaiko drishtikon ra gyanko pracharma ullekhaniya parivartan gareko cha...tar pathlai samjhane kshamata dherai kendrikaranko bhayo."" 

This translates to: ""Renaissance significantly changed the perspective of learning and the dissemination of knowledge... but the ability to understand the text became very focused."" 

This directly links the Renaissance to a greater emphasis on *understanding the text* (path samjhana).  The other options are mentioned in the passage, but not as being *made* more important *by* the Renaissance.



"
"punarutthan ko karan, nimna madhey kun lai kam mahatwa pradan gariyo?","The correct answer is **C: path samjhana (understanding the text)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""pathlai samjhane kshamata dherai kendrikaranko bhayo"" which translates to ""the ability to understand the text became very focused"". This directly indicates that the Renaissance (punarutthan) emphasized understanding the text itself.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: wyaktigat samjhana (individual understanding):** While individual understanding is important, the passage says there was *less* pressure on personal interpretation (""kunai dabawa thiena"").
* **B: gyan prapta garnu (acquiring knowledge):**  The passage mentions a shift in *how* knowledge was acquired, not simply acquiring knowledge itself.
* **D: jankariko vitaran (distribution of information):** The passage focuses on the *method* of learning and understanding, not on spreading information.

Therefore, the passage highlights that the Renaissance placed greater importance on the *ability to understand the text* itself.



"
nimna madhey kunley sambandhaharu lai kayam rakhna internetko prayog garney prerna jhalkaudaina?,"The passage discusses motivations for internet use including education, socialization, maintaining personal connections (""ongoing relationships""), and seeking feedback on websites. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: vyawasaya networking (professional networking):** This falls under maintaining connections and could be considered part of the ""ongoing relationships"" mentioned.
* **B: pariwarharusanga samparkama basna (staying in touch with family):**  This *directly* aligns with maintaining personal connections and ""ongoing relationships.""
* **C: yatra bare anusandhan garna (researching travel):** This is related to *information seeking* and could fall under education or fulfilling a need (planning a trip) - a practical use case.
* **D: naya manisharu bhetna (meeting new people):**  This directly relates to *socialization*, a key motivation mentioned in the text.

The passage doesn't mention seeking new relationships as a primary motivator, instead focusing on maintaining *existing* ones. While meeting new people *can* happen online, the text prioritizes the reinforcement of existing bonds.

Therefore, the answer is **D: naya manisharu bhetna**.



"
nimna madhey kunley wyaktigat sanlagnata ko lagi internetko prayog garney prerna jhalkaudaina?,"The passage discusses motivations for internet use including education, socialization, and maintaining relationships. It specifically mentions Eighmey and McCord identifying personal connections and ""ongoing relationships"" as motivations found in website audience feedback.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: nuskha khojna (Searching for recipes)** - This doesn't inherently imply a need for *personal connection*. It's a task-oriented activity.
* **B: online chhalfal board ma post garna (Posting on an online discussion forum)** - This *directly* relates to socialization and potentially building relationships.
* **C: swasthya sewa utpadanharu bare anusandhan garna (Researching health care products)** -  Similar to recipes, this is task-oriented information gathering.  While someone *might* discuss health with others online, the act of researching itself isn't about connection.
* **D: vitta vyawasthapan garna (Managing finances)** - This is a practical task.  While financial advice *could* be sought from others, the core activity is individual financial management.

The best answer is **A: nuskha khojna** because searching for recipes is the least connected to the motivations of *personal connection* and *ongoing relationships* discussed in the passage.  The others all have a higher potential for social interaction and relationship building.

kahiley dekhi paschimi europe le prabhavharuma dherai bhar parna chodera aafnai saili vikas garna thalyo?,"The correct answer is **A: madhya yugko antya tira** (towards the end of the Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Madhya yugko antyatira paschimi europele afnai shaili vikas garna thaleko thiyo."" (Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: byzantine yugko samaya ma** - The passage says Western styles were *influenced* by Byzantine culture initially, not that they started developing their own style *during* the Byzantine era.
* **C: madhya yugko 25 varsha pachhi** - This refers to when Western styles *received* influences from elsewhere, not when they began to develop independently.
* **D: 11au shatapdi ma** - The passage mentions the 11th century in relation to the peak of Gothic style, not the start of Western Europe's stylistic independence.



"
button ko prayog garera lugaharu kasna ke karan le garda bhayeko ho? ,"The correct answer is **C: crusade**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""dharmayuddhako parinamswarup manisharule tyas samay vikas gareka sabaibhanda mahatwapurna kuramadhye euta kura bhaneko kapda bandhna buttonharuko prayog garnu thiyo.""  This translates to ""As a result of the Crusades, one of the most important things people developed at that time was using buttons to fasten clothes.""

Therefore, the use of buttons in clothing was a consequence of the Crusades.

"anucched anusar, nimna madhye kun lai watawaran samasyaharuko dirghakalin samadhan maaninchha?","The correct answer is **C: samasyahako jad pahichan garera** (identifying the root cause of the problems).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yadyapi, yadi hammy asthayi samadhan matra chahandainaun bhane hamile samasyaharuko judd patta laga ra hamile tiniharulai n parnupardacha."" (However, if we don't just want temporary solutions, we must identify the root of the problems and overcome them).  This directly points to finding the underlying causes as the key to long-term solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: kharchilo jiwansaili ko bahiskar** (eliminating expensive lifestyles): While the passage acknowledges unsustainable lifestyles contribute to problems, it doesn't present it as *the* long-term solution.
*   **B: sakriyavad** (activism):  Joining environmental movements is mentioned, but as something to *do* while seeking solutions, not as the solution itself.
*   **D: watawaran andolanko sahayogi bhaera** (being a supporter of environmental movements): Similar to B, this is a supportive action, not the core solution.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna samadhan madhye kun lai watawaran samasyaharuko lakshanatmak upachar manidaina?","The correct answer is **B: samasyako jadlai nishkirya banaera** (by making the root of the problem inactive).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yadyapi, yadi hammy asthayi samadhan matra chahandainaun bhane hamile samasyaharuko judd patta laga ra hamile tiniharulai n parnupardacha."" (however, if we don't just want temporary solutions, we must identify the roots of the problems and address them).

This directly implies that *not* addressing the root cause is **not** a characteristic of a thorough or lasting solution to environmental problems.  It suggests that a true solution *requires* addressing the underlying issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sakriyavadma sanmlagna bhayera** (by getting involved in activism) - The passage encourages participation in environmental movements.
*   **C: kharchilo jiwansaili bare viicharharu vyakta garera** (by expressing thoughts about expensive lifestyles) - The passage implicitly criticizes unsustainable lifestyles.
*   **D: watawaran maitri jiwansaili baachera** (by living an environmentally friendly lifestyle) - The passage supports adopting an environmentally friendly lifestyle.



"
europe ko kun deshma kunai yuddha pahilo patak dharmako lagi nabhaer shakti santulanko vishaya ma bhaeko maninchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Kendriya mudda shakti santulan bhaeko spanis uttaradhikarko yuddha pahilo yuddhaka rupma liiyo.**"" This translates to: ""The central issue of the balance of power was the Spanish War of Succession, which took the form of the first war.""

Therefore, the passage identifies the Spanish War of Succession as the first war connected to the balance of power in Europe, and specifically mentions it wasn't fought under the guise of religious conflict.



"
Kun yuddhalai kahilekahi antim ‘dharmik yuddha’ bhanera vyakhya garinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: tis varshako yuddha (Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""yasartha, tees warshako yuddha antim dharmik yuddhako rupma ankit hunechha."" which translates to ""therefore, the Thirty Years' War is marked as the last religious war.""

nimna madhye catholic churchko kun paksha lai dhyanpurvak heri rahiyeko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **C: churchbhitra shaktiko kendrikaran** (the centralization of power within the church).

The passage specifically states that the accumulation of wealth and power led people to question whether the church's doctrines were actually being followed. This directly relates to the concentration of authority (and thus power) in the central authority in Rome.  The question ""ke ke yadi yo siddhanta pura bhairaheko cha"" (whether this principle was actually being followed) refers to the doctrine of using wealth to alleviate suffering, and the concern stems from the church's *centralized power and wealth*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: yedi church bhitrako dhan vitawaran thik thiyo ki thiyena** (whether the distribution of wealth within the church was fair) - While related to the issue, the passage focuses on *whether the stated principle of using wealth to help the poor was being followed*, not necessarily the fairness of distribution.
*   **B: yedi dharmako mukhya sidhantaharu samsodhan garnu parchha ki pardaina** (whether the main doctrines of religion needed to be revised) -  The question is about adherence to existing doctrines, not whether they needed changing.
*   **D: yedi churchko mukhya sidhantaharu palana bhairaheko thiyo ki thiyena** (whether the main doctrines of the church were being followed) - This is too broad. The passage focuses on one specific doctrine (wealth and poverty) as a point of contention stemming from the church's power.

"anuchhed anusar, versailles kaslai marieko thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: bhidko ek sadasya** (a member of the crowd).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ek thaunma bhidka ek sadasyale bhayawit raniko aghadi bharselasma marieka ek shahi surakshakarmiko tauko pani hallayo.""  This translates to ""From one place, a member of the crowd, in the frightened queen's presence, even struck the hat of a royal guard."" 

This directly indicates a member of the crowd *struck* someone (and therefore ""mariek"" in the context of hitting/striking). The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bajarko euta mahila** (a woman from the town) - The passage doesn't mention a woman striking anyone.
*   **B: raja louis XVI** (king Louis XVI) - He was being threatened, not doing the striking.
*   **D: surakshakarmi** (guard) - The guard was *struck*, not doing the striking.



"
nimna madhye raja ra rani laai bhidle jabarjasti ke garna lagayenan?,"The correct answer is **D: paris firtaa ko yatra** (a journey to Paris).

Here's why:

The text states the mob *forced* the King, Queen, their children, and the royal family to travel from Versailles *to Paris*.  This forced journey is the direct result of the mob surrounding their carriages and making demands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uniharuko gadiko jhyalharu kholna** (opening their carriage doors) - While the mob *made* them open the carriage doors, that wasn't the overall *action* being forced upon them. It was a step *during* the forced journey.
*   **B: versailles bata achanak niskashan** (sudden evacuation from Versailles) - It wasn't a voluntary evacuation, it was a forced relocation.
*   **C: surakshakarmiko tauko kateko herna** (seeing a guard's head cut off) - This is a *detail* of the event, a horrific incident *during* the journey, but not the overall action the mob forced upon the royals.



"
nimna madhye kun belayatko aparamparkik naval yuddhako natija thiena?,"The correct answer is **D: mahatwapurna apurtiharu pahunch garna sakiena** (important supplies couldn't reach their destination).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany, ""Mahatwapurna sainya ra nagarik apurtiharu band garera"" (blocking important military and civilian supplies).  The effectiveness of the blockade *was* in preventing supplies from getting through, even though it violated international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: germanyko testai yuddha rananiti prayog garney ichhyaa** (Germany's desire to implement the same war strategy) - The passage mentions Germany *responding* with submarine warfare, but not that they desired to copy Britain's strategy initially.
*   **B: sanmlagna nabhayekaa jahajharu jokhim ma pareka thie** (Neutral ships were at risk) - While true (the passage says ""tatastha jahajharulai samet khatra puryayo""), this is a *consequence* of the blockade, not the primary result/outcome.
*   **C: antarashtriya kanun haru maa pariwartan gariyo** (Changes were made to international law) - The passage states the blockade *violated* international law, it doesn't say it *changed* the law.



"
kun chai vakya le belayatko germany biriuddha naval nakabandiko varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: yesley tatastha jahajharu jokhimma nahuney sunischit garyo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the blockade *did* put neutral ships at risk (""tatastha jahajharulai samet khatra puryayo""). So, the statement that it ensured their safety is the one that *doesn't* describe the naval blockade.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions of the blockade:

*   **A: yo antarrashtriya kanun biruddha gayo** - The passage states the blockade violated international law.
*   **B: yesley germanyko pandubbi yuddh lai uksaayo** -  The passage mentions Germany expected retaliation and responded with submarine warfare.
*   **C: yesley germanko apurtiharuko bahav lai awarodh garyo** - The passage says it blocked important military and civilian supplies (""Mahatwapurna sainya ra nagarik apurtiharu band garera"").

"anuchhed anusar, kaslai multiple sclerosis ko pahichan garne sambhawana badhi hunchha?","Correct answer: **A: ek 32 varshako mahila**

Here's why:

The passage states that MS is most common in young to middle-aged adults and that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men. A 32-year-old woman fits both of these criteria.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ek 15 varshako purush:** MS is less common in younger people (15 years old is very young) and men have a lower risk.
*   **C: ek 43 varshako purush:** While 43 is within the middle-age range, men are at a lower risk.
*   **D: ek 10 varshako mahila:** 10 years old is too young for MS to be likely, even for a woman."
"anuchhed anusar, niyamit gatiwidhiko sahabhagiharu lai keko lagi dherai sahayogko awashyakta paryo?","Sahi jawab **A: pidaa bare nakaratmak dharana** ho.

"anuchhed anusar, taraarwaji praya: kasari khelinchha?","The correct answer is **D: dwanda ko prarupma** (duel form).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Taraarwajiko adhunik khel... ek fencerle arkolai dwell gardacha,"" which translates to ""Modern Taraarwaji game... a fencer duels another.""  This directly describes the game being played as a duel or one-on-one contest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adhunik prarupma** (modern form) - While it *is* a modern form of the game, it doesn’t describe *how* it's played.
*   **B: biswaviddyalaya starma** (university level) - It's played at the university level, but that's *where* it's played, not *how*.
*   **C: olympic starma** (olympic level) - Same as B - it’s a location/level of play, not the method.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye kun antarik vishaktatako sab bhanda baliyo suchak ho?","The correct answer is **D: prescription aushadhiko bottle** (prescription medicine bottle).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Antarik wishaktatako uttam sanket aushadhiko khula container wa vishakta gharelu rasayanko upasthiti hoon sakdachha."" (The best indication of accidental poisoning is the presence of open medicine containers or poisonous household chemicals).  A prescription medicine bottle fits directly into this category.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: waakwaak ra jyoro (speech and fever):** These are general symptoms and aren't specifically mentioned as strong indicators in the passage.
*   **B: banta ra pasina aunu (vomiting and sweating):** The passage states these are common symptoms *that make it difficult to diagnose poisoning quickly*. They aren't strong indicators themselves.
*   **C: tibra aithan ra pet dukhai (severe weakness and stomach ache):** Again, these are general symptoms that aren't flagged as a primary sign.



"
"anuchhed anusar, piditko jaanch garda pahilo sahi kadam ke ho?","The correct answer is **A: sthalko awalokan** (site survey/observation of the location).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Piditko jaanch garna, tapainle pahile **afno surakshaka lagi sthalko sarwekshan garnuparchha**.""  This translates to: ""To investigate the victim, first you must survey the location for your own safety.""

The passage explicitly says the *first* step when investigating a victim is to survey the location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: piditko najik janu** (get close to the victim) - The passage warns against this initially, prioritizing your own safety first.
* **C: piditko sthiti ko jaanch garnu** (assess the victim's condition) - This comes *after* assessing the location for safety.
* **D: maddatko lagi parkhanuhosh** (wait for help) - The passage emphasizes *you* taking action, not just waiting.



"
nimna kathan madhey kunley piditlai jaanch garney prakriyalai sahi tarika janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: afulai chotpatak lagna sakney bare chintit nahunu** (Don't worry about getting hurt yourself).

Here's why:

The passage (P) *explicitly states* that seeking to help can put *you* at risk of injury. It's crucial to prioritize your own safety *before* attempting a rescue. Option A directly contradicts this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: piditbhanda pahila sthalko jaanch garnu** (Check the area first before approaching the victim) - This is directly stated in the passage.
*   **C: piditko sthitiko awalokan garnu** (Assess the victim's situation) - The passage mentions keeping the victim's condition in mind.
*   **D: kunai pani rato jhanda mathi dhyan dinu** (Pay attention to any red flags) - The passage uses the metaphor of ""red flags"" to indicate potential dangers.

Therefore, only option A is a wrong approach to investigating to help a victim.



"
france ko krantile lyayeko kun pariwartanle mazdoor wargako nagarikharuma sabai bhanda thulo prabhaw lyayo?,"The correct answer is **C: ganatantra siddhanta lai grahan garnu (Adopting the principles of democracy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...nirankushtabata ganatantrako agaman, rashtraad ra desh euta shasakko matra nabhai janataharuko pani ho bhane vishwas chan."" ( ""...the transition from absolutism to democracy, the belief that the nation and the country belong not just to a ruler but to the people as well."") This directly links the French Revolution to the rise of democratic ideals.
* **The passage also mentions:** The revolution inspired oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions. This implies a shift towards empowering the people – a core tenet of democracy.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: rashtrako samarthan ma briddhi (Increased support for the nation):** While nationalism *was* a consequence, the passage doesn't highlight this as the *biggest* impact on the working class.
* **B: warga bhanda yogyata ma dhyan dinu (Focusing on merit rather than class):** The passage actually states the military hierarchy was *based* on class, suggesting this wasn't a major change brought about by the revolution.
* **D: ek naya mapan pranali (A new measurement system):** The metric system is mentioned, but it's presented as one of *many* influences, not the most impactful change for the working class.



Therefore, the adoption of democratic principles is the most significant change brought about by the French Revolution that the passage connects to empowering the working class and inspiring revolutions elsewhere."
"france ko kranti pachhi, sainik ra anya peshaharu ma safalta kema dherai adharit nahuney vayo?","The correct answer is **B: warga (class)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""senako shrenikaran wargama adharit bhaetapni, uniharu halma kailabarma adharitathie"" which translates to ""the army's hierarchy was based on class, and their advancements were also based on it.""  This means success in the military and other professions *was* heavily reliant on class.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uplabdhi (achievement):** While achievement plays a role, the text emphasizes class as the *primary* basis for advancement.
* **C: mahattwakanshya (ambition):**  Ambition is mentioned as a trait of revolutionary men, but it doesn't explain *how* success was determined.
* **D: kshayamata (decline):** The text doesn't discuss a decline in opportunity. It highlights a system where opportunity was restricted by class.



"
vikasit deshharuma sabai bhanda badhi kun sarvajanik sewaley asantushti hunchha vaninchha?,"The correct answer is **C: sarwajanik yatayat (public transportation)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Wiksit deshharuma, tapain paniko gunastar wa pulharu tall jharne jasta barema gunasoharu wirlai sunnuhunchha."" (In developed countries, you often hear complaints about things like water quality or bridges collapsing).  Then it asks *why* infrastructure, including transportation, causes so much dissatisfaction despite daily failures. This strongly implies public transportation is a significant source of frustration in developed countries.

While water quality (A) and bridge construction (B) *can* be issues, the passage frames the question specifically around the *daily* issues people face, and transportation systems affect more people on a daily basis.  Education (D) is also important, but the passage's focus is on infrastructure and systems failures.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, sarwajanik yatayat pranaliharu bare ke bhanna sakinchha?","The correct answer is **C: tiniharu ko prayog garne dherale gunaso garchhan** (people often complain about their implementation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""lagbhag sabaijanale yatayat pranaliharuka barema gunaso gardachan"" which directly translates to ""almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tiniharulai prayog graney sabaijanaly tiniharulai man parauchhan** (people accept them when they are implemented) - The passage indicates *complaints*, not acceptance.
* **B: tiniharu paniko gunastar jatiko naramro hudainan** (their quality isn't very bad) -  The passage mentions complaints even in developed countries, suggesting quality *is* often an issue.
* **D: tiniharu dheraijaso vikasit deshharuma nishulka hunchhan** (they are often free in developed countries) - The passage doesn't mention if they are free or not.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun driverko anishchittako karan anuman garna garo hunchha?","Correct answer: **A: traffic ko beg**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Driverko wyawahar soy pratishat nishchittaka sath bhavishyavani garna nasakine hunda durbhagyawash yatayat praaha adhyayan gahro cha."" (Driver behavior is difficult to predict with certainty, making traffic flow studies challenging). It then links this unpredictability to the study of traffic flow.

The passage goes on to identify **beg (speed)** as one of the three key characteristics used to represent traffic flow.  Since driver behavior is unpredictable, and beg is a core characteristic of traffic flow, it logically follows that the unpredictability of drivers contributes to the difficulty in determining traffic beg.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: bato nirmanko yojana (road construction planning)** - The passage mentions road planning benefits *from* understanding traffic flow, not as a cause of driver unpredictability.
*   **C: bato sanchalan (road management)** - Similar to B, road management benefits *from* traffic flow studies.
*   **D: traffic ko bahav (traffic flow)** - The passage states traffic flow is studied *because* driver behavior is unpredictable, not the other way around. The flow itself isn’t the source of the uncertainty.



"
nimna madhey kun traffic ko bahaav lai ganitiya rupma dekhauda prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: path ko design**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yea sambandhaharule (the relationships between flow, density, and speed) **path suwidha yojana, design ra sanchalanma maddat puryaunchhan**."" (These relationships help in path planning, **design**, and operation). 

The question asks which is depicted mathematically. The passage specifically links the three characteristics (flow, density, speed) to the *design* of roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bato sanchalan (road operation):** While the relationships are *used* in operation, the passage doesn't say they are *depicted* mathematically in it.
*   **B: driverko wyavahaar (driver behavior):** The passage explicitly states driver behavior is unpredictable and difficult to model.
*   **D: traffic ko ghanatwa (traffic density):** Density is *one* of the variables in the relationships, but not the overall application of mathematical depiction.



"
hershey ra chase le uniharuko dna pratyaropan garna ke prayog gare? ,"The correct answer is **A: radioactive fasforas**.

Here's why:

* **Hershey and Chase's Experiment:** They used radioactive phosphorus to label DNA and radioactive sulfur to label protein. Their goal was to determine which of these molecules entered the bacterial cells during viral infection (and therefore carried the genetic information).
* **The Result:** They found that the radioactive phosphorus (DNA) entered the bacteria, while the radioactive sulfur (protein) largely stayed outside. This demonstrated that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material responsible for viral replication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: anuwanshik samagri (genetic material):** This is what they *discovered* was DNA, but not *what* they used in the experiment.
* **C: radioactive salfar (radioactive sulfur):** They used this to label protein, but it didn't enter the bacteria and therefore wasn't the key finding.
* **D: virusharu (viruses):** Viruses were the subject of the experiment, not what they used to track genetic material.



"
Utpariwartan santanharulai dina sakne kshamata ke ma nirbhar chha?,"The correct answer is **A: yedi koshharu jiwanu-rekha ho bhane** (if the cells are germline cells).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Anyatra pariwartanle sell mrityu wa cancer nimtyauna sakne hunale jiwanu rekha koshharuma hune utpariwartan bacchalai dina sakinchha."" This translates to: ""Changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer, therefore mutations that occur in germline cells can be passed on to offspring.""

* **Germline cells** (jiwanu-rekha koshharu) are the cells that produce gametes (sperm and egg). Mutations in these cells *are* heritable and can be passed on to future generations.  Mutations in somatic cells (other body cells) are not.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: anuwanshik samagriko mahattwa** (the importance of the genetic material): While the genetic material *is* important, the passage doesn't say whether a mutation is heritable depends on the importance of the affected material. It depends *where* the mutation occurs.
* **C: Utpariwartan ko prakar** (the type of mutation): The type of mutation (e.g., insertion, deletion, substitution) doesn't determine if it's heritable. It influences the *effect* of the mutation, but not its transmissibility.
* **D: yedi utpariwartanle kosh ko mrityu garna sakchha bhane** (if the mutation can cause cell death):  Whether a mutation causes cell death is irrelevant to whether it's passed on to offspring.  The passage contrasts mutations that cause cell death *with* those in germline cells that *can* be passed on.



"
"anuchhedma diyeko jankari anusar, utpariwartanko vibhinna asarharu kema nirbhar hudainan?","Correct answer is **D: प्रभवित उत्परिवर्तनोंको प्रकार (prabhavit utpariwartanko prakar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the effects of mutations (""utpariwartan"") *depend* on the *type* of mutation. It explains that some mutations can be harmless, while others can lead to cell death or cancer. This directly links the *effect* of the mutation to its *type*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: कति आनुवंशिक सामग्री प्रभावित भायोको छ (kati anuwanshik samagri prabhavit bhayeko chha - how much genetic material is affected):** While the amount of genetic material affected is *a* factor, the passage doesn't say it determines the *different* effects.
*   **B: यदि प्रभावित कोशहरु किटानु-रेखा हुन भने (yadi prabhavit koshharu kitanu-rekha hun bhane - if the affected cells are germline cells):**  The passage specifically highlights the importance of mutations in germline cells (kitanu-rekha koshharu) *because* they are passed on, but doesn't say the effects *depend* on whether the cells are germline or not. It's about the consequences of inheritance.
*   **C: प्रभावित आनुवंशिक सामग्रीको महत्त्व (prabhavit anuwanshik samagriko mahattwa - the importance of the affected genetic material):** The importance of the affected genetic material is a factor, but not the determining factor of the *different* effects of mutations.



Therefore, the passage most directly states that the *type* of mutation is what determines its different effects."
nimna madhye kun prachin sanskritiharule bakharharu rakhney karan hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: tiniharule bhaichara pradan garthe** (they provided companionship).

Here's why:

The text states the reasons for keeping sheep were:

*   **Dudh upalabdha garauthiye** (for milk availability)
*   **Masu upalabdha garauthiye** (for meat availability)
*   **Kapal, chhalako sajilo pahunchka lagi** (for wool and easy access to skin/hides)
*   **Jamin charna maddat garthe** (helped graze the land).

The text doesn't mention companionship as a reason for keeping sheep in ancient cultures. Therefore, option C is the one that *isn't* mentioned as a reason."
golfko lakshya ke sabai bhanda kum line ho?,"The correct answer is **B: strokeharu**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Thorai struckharu line ra clubko layama khelne kheladile khel jitdai khel pura gardachan"" which translates to ""The player who completes the game with the fewest strokes and club rhythm wins the game."" This directly indicates that the goal of golf is to have the *fewest strokes* to complete the course.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ballharu (balls):** While you need balls to play, the goal isn't to have the fewest balls.
*   **C: samaya (time):**  There's no mention of a time limit being the determining factor in winning.
*   **D: pwalharu (holes):** You need to complete all the holes, but the *number of strokes* it takes to do so is what matters.



"
"ek golf coursema, kaha ghaas alik choto katiyeko hunchha?","Correct answer is **A: athauraun pwalma**.

The passage states: ""yasalai green bhaninchha"" (this is called the green) and ""pwalko waripariko ghaans chhoto banainchha ra"" (the grass around the hole is cut short). This short-cut grass area is specifically around the 18th hole (and all other holes) and is called the green. Therefore, the grass is cut short on the 18th hole.



"
ek parikshanko samanya lakshya ke ho?,"The correct answer is **A: ek wa badhi sambhawit parikalpanaharu hataunu** (to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**parikshan bhaneko ek jaanch ho june ek wa badhi sambhawit parikalpanaharu hatauna prayog garinchha**"" which translates to ""**an experiment is an investigation that uses experimentation to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sansar kasari kaam garchha bhanera patta lagauna** (to find out how the world works) - While this is the *overall* goal of science, it's not the specific goal of a single experiment.
* **C: prashnaharu sodhna** (to ask questions) - Asking questions is a part of the scientific process, but not the primary goal of an experiment itself.
* **D: vaigyanik anusandhanlai margadarshan garna** (to guide scientific research) - Experiments *contribute* to guiding research, but their direct aim isn't to guide it.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kun kura le vaigyanik anusandhanlai margadarshan garna maddat gardaina?","Correct answer is **A: vaigyanik vidhile matra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vigyanko mukhya lakshya bhaneko vaigyanik vidhimarfat sansarle kasari cam garchha bhane patta lagaunu ho. Yo vidhi wastawma sabaibhanda badhi vaigyanik anusandhanko margadarshan garchha. **Yadyapi yo eklo chhaina**, parikshan (parikshan bhaneko ek jaanch ho june ek wa badhi sambhawit parikalpanaharu hatauna prayog garinchha), prashnaharu sodhnale ra awalokan garnale pani vaigyanik anusandhanlai margadarshan gardacha.""

This translates to: ""The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. This method guides scientific research the most. **However, it is not the only one**; experiments (experiments are investigations that try to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions and observations also guide scientific research.""

The bolded part clearly indicates that the scientific method *alone* doesn't guide scientific research – it needs to be supplemented by experiments, questioning, and observation. Therefore, only the scientific method is not enough to guide scientific research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: awalokan garera (Observation)** – The passage explicitly states observation *does* guide research.
* **C: sambhawit parikalpanaharu hatayera (Eliminating possible hypotheses)** – This is what experiments do, and the passage says experiments guide research.
* **D: prayogharu garera (Conducting experiments)** – The passage explicitly states experiments guide research.

"anuchhed anusar, tufanharubare kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **C: adhikamsa tufanharu teen ghanta bhanda badhi tikchhan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""sabaibhanda hinsrak dui pratishat aandhibehariharu teen ghanta bhanda badhi samayasamma rahanchhan."" This translates to ""The most violent two percent of hurricanes last more than three hours."" This means *only 2%* of hurricanes last more than three hours, not the majority.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: tufanharu le uniharu waripari vayeka sabai kura nashta garna sakchhan** - This is true. The passage says they can destroy everything in their path.
* **B: anya andhibehari bhanda tufanharuley sano kshetrama prahar garchhan** - This is true. The passage starts by saying hurricanes hit areas more.
* **D: kehi tufanharuko gati 300 miles prati ghanta samma hunchha** - This is true. The passage states the speed of these hurricanes is 480 kilometers/hour which equals 300 mph.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna kathanharu madhey kunley adhikamsa tufanharulai sahi tarikaley varnan gardachha?","The correct answer is **A: teeniharu dherai jaso teen ghanta bhanda badhi tikchaan** (they usually last more than three hours).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""sabaibhanda hinsrak dui pratishat aandhibehariharu teen ghanta bhanda badhi samayasamma rahanchhan."" (The most violent two percent of hurricanes last more than three hours). This directly describes a characteristic of *most* (the most violent two percent) hurricanes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tiniharuley 480 miles prati ghantako gati srijana garchhan** (they create a speed of 480 miles per hour) - The text gives the speed as 480 *kilometers* per hour, not miles.  And it describes the speed *of* the hurricanes, not something they *create*.
* **C: tiniharuley anya adhiberi bhanda badhi kshetralai asar garchhan** (they affect larger areas than other storms) - The text doesn't compare the affected areas of hurricanes to other storms.
* **D: tiniharu jaminbata rukhharu ukhalna sakchhan** (they can uproot trees from the ground) -  The text *shows* they uproot trees as an *effect* of the hurricane, but doesn't state this is what *defines* them.  It's a consequence, not a defining characteristic.



"
nimna madhey kun kura mancheharule 16aun shatabdidekhi garna suru gare?,"The correct answer is **D: telescopeharu banauna** (building telescopes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""pahila asal telescopeharu europema 16 aun shatabdiko antyatira baneka thee"" (The first telescopes were made in Europe towards the end of the 16th century).  This directly answers the question of what people *started doing* in the 16th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lensharu ko prayog (experimenting with lenses):** While the passage mentions using lenses *in* telescopes, it doesn't say people started experimenting with lenses specifically *in* the 16th century. They were already using lenses for magnification before that.
* **B: wastuharulai magnify garera herna (looking at objects by magnifying them):**  People were likely magnifying objects before the 16th century with lenses, but the passage focuses on the invention of the *telescope* for this purpose.
* **C: lensharu banauna (making lenses):** The passage doesn't say people began *making* lenses in the 16th century, just that they used them to build telescopes. Lens making likely existed before this time.



"

Here's why:

The text states ""Hajaraun warshadekhi magnificationka mancheharule lensharu banaera prayog gariraheka chan"" which translates to ""For thousands of years, people have been making and experimenting with lenses for magnification.""

Therefore, people have been using lenses to magnify objects for **thousands of years**.

"anuchhed anusar, muhammadko gufaley usko adhyatmik karyaharu ra manyataharu barey ke bhanchha?","The correct answer is **A: uslai shanta ra ekanta maanparchha** (it provided him with peace and solitude).

Here's why:

The passage states that Muhammad sought ""gahiro chaso"" (deep solitude) and repeatedly used the cave. It's described as a place separate from the world (""purna rupma alag cha"") and where he could escape worldly distractions.  The passage explicitly links this solitude to his spiritual inclination (""adhyatmik jhukawako dherai jwalanta chhawi"").  The imagery of the cave – clear sky, mountains – emphasizes a peaceful and isolated environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bahiri hallaley dhyanma maddat gardacha** (external events helped in meditation) - The passage emphasizes *escaping* the world, not being aided by it.
* **C: uslai thorai ekal samay chahinthyo** (he wanted some alone time) - This is too weak. The passage portrays a deep *need* for solitude, not just a desire for some alone time.
* **D: uslai aafu dekhina ra sunine bare chinta hunthiyo** (he was worried about what he saw and heard) - The passage states he could *barely* see or hear the world *inside* the cave, it doesn't imply anxiety about it.



"
"anuchhed anusar, falam pahila ke kolagi prayog garinthiyo?","The correct answer is **C: pangraharu** (axles).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...falamle wahanharuko kathka pangraharuma badhi tootfoot garayo. Antyama, kathka pangraharu falamka pangraharudwara pratisthapan garieka thee.""  This translates to: ""...the flukes damaged the axles of the wagons. Eventually, wagon axles were replaced with fluke axles.""

This clearly indicates that flukes (falam) were first used to replace or improve the *axles* (pangraharu) of the wagons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: crossitie (cross ties)** - The passage mentions cross ties were considered but ultimately steep flukes were found more efficient.
*   **B: ghodadwara chalne rail (horse-drawn rail)** - While the rails were used by horse-drawn vehicles, the flukes weren't initially for them directly, but for the wagons' components.
*   **D: rail** - The flukes weren't directly applied to the rails themselves.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kathka pangraharulai kina falamka pangraharudwaara pratisthapan gariyo?","The correct answer is **D: tiniharu patrima vayeka falamley kamjor bandai thiye** (they made the flints weaker by wearing on them).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""wistarai, tathapi, yo mahasus bhayo key yadi patariharukamathi falamko steep bhayo bhane adhik kushal hunechha. Yo samanya abhyas bhayo, tar falamle wahanharuko kathka pangraharuma badhi tootfoot garayo. Antyama, kathka pangraharu falamka pangraharudwara pratisthapan garieka thee.""

This translates to: ""Eventually, however, it was realized that it would be more efficient if the flints were steeper on the tracks. This became common practice, but the flints wore down the wooden cheeks of the wagons. Ultimately, wooden cheeks were replaced with iron ones.""

This clearly shows the wooden cheeks (kathka pangraharu) were being damaged *by* the flints (falamka pangraharu) due to wear and tear. So, iron cheeks were installed to replace the weakened wooden ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ghodaharuko gatima briddhi** (increase in the speed of horses) - While the roads did allow for faster travel, this wasn't the direct reason for the change in cheek material.
*   **B: tiniharulai ajha prabhawkari maninthiyo** (they were still considered effective) - The passage indicates the wooden cheeks *failed* due to wear.
*   **C: tiniharule thulo bhar samhalna sakthe** (they could handle heavier loads) - The passage doesn't mention load capacity as the reason for the change.



"
"anuchhed anusar, romantikwadma wyaktiharulai kun kurale prabhawit garyo?","The correct answer is **B: bhugol** (geography).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Swachchhandatawadko sandarbhama, **bhugolle wyaktiharulai dhalkayo** ra samayako kramasangai bhugolsanga sambandhit reeti-riwaz ra sanskriti utpanna bhae..."" This translates to: ""In the context of Romanticism, **geography influenced individuals** and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerged...""

Therefore, the passage directly links Romanticism (and its influence on individuals) to geography. The other options are mentioned as *results* of geographical influence, but not as the initial influence itself.



"
nimna madhey kun kathanley prawidhik nirdharanko samanya vichar jhalkaudaina? ,"The correct answer is **B: pravidhiko vikashlai sanskritile prabhawit gardaina** (Technology's development is not influenced by culture).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that most interpretations of technological determination share the common idea that ""technological development follows a path relatively independent of cultural or political influence."" However, it *also* implies that technology *does* ultimately adapt to social forms and has ""influence"" on society – meaning there *is* a relationship, even if development starts independently.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

*   **A: samajma prawidhiko prabhawharu samajik rupma anukulit hunchhan** (Technology's influences adapt socially in society) - This is a core idea presented in the passage (""praidhile samijik rupma anukulit garnuko sattama antarnihit samajharuma """"prabhawa"""" parchha"").
*   **C: pravidhiko samajma antarik prabhaw hunchha** (Technology has an inherent influence on society) - Also a key point from the passage.
*   **D: pravidhik vikash raajniti prabhawma adharit hudaina** (Technological development is not based on political influence) -  The passage states it is relatively independent of *both* cultural and political influence.

Option B directly contradicts the nuanced idea presented in the passage; while initial development may be independent, culture (and politics) are ultimately factors.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye kun bow tannasanga sambandhit chhaina?","Correct answer is **D: bhyaguto ma suru garnu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:**
    *   ""up bow"" chinha looks like an eyebrow.
    *   ""down bow"" chinha looks like a staple.
    *   Up bow starts from the tip (mathi) and pulls the bow.
    *   Down bow starts from the frog (tall) and pushes the bow.
    *   Up-bow generally produces a sweeter sound.
    *   Down bow is stronger and sharper.

*   **Options Analysis:**
    *   **A: euta madhuro awaj** - The passage directly links ""up bow"" to a sweeter sound.
    *   **B: euta staple jasto dekhine chinha** - The passage explicitly describes ""down bow"" as looking like a staple.
    *   **C: euta baliyo awaj** - The passage connects ""down bow"" with a stronger sound.
    *   **D: bhyaguto ma suru garnu** - The passage states down bow starts at the *frog* (tall), not the back (""bhyaguto"") of the bow.

Therefore, ""starting at the back"" is not a characteristic described for any of the bow techniques in the passage, making it the correct answer."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun madhuro awajsanga sambandhit chaina?","The correct answer is **A: euta down bow chinha**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

*   The text explicitly states: ""Euta up-bole samanyataya madhuro dhwani utpanna garchha jabki down bow baliyo ra thap thado hunchha."" (An up-bow typically produces a sweet sound while a down bow is strong and forceful).
*   Therefore, a *down bow* is associated with a strong, forceful sound, **not** a sweet/melodious sound.

Let's look at why the other options are related to a sweet sound:

*   **B: bow tannu (bow tightening/loosening):** While not directly stating sweetness, adjusting the bow tension is part of creating nuanced tones, including softer, more melodic ones.
*   **C: euta V jasto dekhiney chinha (a V-shaped sign):** The text explains that the ""up bo chinha"" looks like a ""V"" and is related to producing a sweet sound.
*   **D: tapaiko hatley bow samateko thaubata suru garney (starting from where your hand rests with the bow):** This refers to the starting point for an up-bow, which, as the text states, is associated with a sweet sound.



"
jiwashmaharule dekhauchha ki hatharu bistarai prathamik rupma nimna madhey kun prayog garna anukulan vayo?,"The correct answer is **B: bhar bokna** (carrying weight).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hominids did not use their hands to walk or to support their weight or to climb trees like monkeys do."" However, it *also* mentions that fossil hand bones from 2-3 million years ago show a shift from locomotion (walking) to manipulation, implying the hands became adapted for tasks *other* than walking or climbing. The context suggests this shift involved increasingly using hands for carrying things, supporting weight, and more precise manipulation.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: herfer (tools)** - While tool use is a later development, the passage focuses on the *initial* adaptation shown by the fossils.
* **C: chal (walk)** - The passage explicitly states hominids didn't use hands for walking.
* **D: aula ko jorni le hidhnu (swinging from trees)** -  The passage states they didn't use hands to climb trees like monkeys.



"
nimna madhey kunle chimpanjiko hatharulai sahi tarikale varnan garchha? ,"The correct answer is **C: tiniharu bhar bokna prayog hunchhan** (they are used to support weight).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chimpanjiko haat ra kutta akar ra lambaima ustai hunchhan, jasle aunlaa tekera hindda taul boknako lagi hatko prayoglai jhalkaunchhan.""  This translates to ""Chimpanzees' hands and feet are similar in shape and length, suggesting their hands are used to support weight when climbing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tiniharu manav bhanda sidha hunchhan** (they are straighter than humans) - The passage doesn't compare the straightness of chimpanzee hands to human hands.
*   **B: tiniharu ko hatharu ra khuttaharu bhinna akarka hunchhan** (their hands and feet are different shapes) - The passage states they are *similar* in shape, not different.
*   **D: tiniharu prathamik rupma niyantrankolagi prayog hunchhan** (they are primarily used for control) - While chimps use their hands for manipulation, the passage highlights their weight-bearing function as a primary characteristic.



"
chayanle kun samuha bata naya anuwanshik bhinnata hatauchha?,"The correct answer is **D: abhiwyakta** (expressed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Utpariwartanle naya anuwanshik bhinnata thapchha ra **chayanle yasalai abhiwyakta bhinnatako pulbata hataunchha**.""  This directly translates to: ""Mutation creates new genetic variation, and **selection acts on this to favor expressed variation**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: lukeko** (hidden) - While hidden variation exists, selection acts *on* expressed variation, not hidden variation directly.
*   **B: punasanyojan** (recombination) - Recombination shuffles existing variation but doesn’t *create* the new variation that selection acts upon.
*   **C: viyog** (segregation) - Segregation is part of how variation is distributed, but doesn’t itself generate the variation selection acts on.



"

*   **वियोग (A):** वियोगले गुणसूत्रहरू छुट्ट्याउँछ, तर नयाँ भिन्नता सिर्जना गर्दैन।
*   **पुनर्संयोजन (B):** पुनर्संयोजनले विद्यमान जीनहरूलाई पुन: मिलाउँछ, तर नयाँ जीन बनाउँदैन।
*   **अभिव्यक्त (D):** अभिव्यक्त आनुवंशिक भिन्नताको परिणाम हो, तर भिन्नताको कारण होइन।"
"annuchhed ma bhayeko jankariko adharma, “protein samasya” samadhan garna primate le ke khaanu parchha?","The correct answer is **A: mareko paatharu** (fruits and vegetables).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Paat ra falafulharuma paine protinharu sabaibhanda sajilo ra pahunchayogya vanaspati srotharu hoon sakthe."" This translates to: ""Fruits and vegetables contain proteins that can be the easiest and most accessible plant sources.""

The passage discusses the difficulty primates have obtaining enough amino acids from plants, but then specifically suggests fruits and vegetables as a relatively easy solution. The other options (kancho gedagudi, phatyangraharu, fulko danthharu) are not mentioned in the text as solutions to the protein problem.



"
"anucchedko anusar, nimna samasyaharu madhey kun amino acidsko kamile garda bhayeko hoina?","The correct answer is **A: paachan samasya**.

Here's why:

The passage states that primates struggle to get enough amino acids from plants, and *specifically mentions* difficulty digesting fruits and vegetables due to their fiber content. This difficulty in digestion *is* a problem. The passage goes on to say that failing to get enough amino acids leads to mental stress (manasik chintama wriddhi), malnutrition (kuposhan), and eventually death (mrityu).

Therefore, digestive issues themselves aren’t the *result* of an amino acid deficiency, they are a *cause* of it, making A the only option not described as a consequence of insufficient amino acids. The other options (B, C, and D) are explicitly listed as consequences.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Upasanskritika sadasyaharu pry: shailiko wishishta ra pratikatmak prayogko madhyambata tiniharuko sadasyata sanket gardachan, jasma shaili, tarika ra argot samawesh cha.""  This directly translates to: ""Subcultural members primarily signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including style, mannerisms, and argot.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ghulmil hune prayash garera** (by needing to blend in) - This is the opposite of what subcultures do; they often intentionally *distinguish* themselves.
* **B: uniharu wariparika sabaijanako wicharharu anukulan garera** (by conforming to the thoughts of everyone around them) - Subcultures often have views that diverge from mainstream thought.
* **C: samajik mapdandaharu swikar garera** (by accepting social norms) - Subcultures often challenge or reject social norms.



"
"anuchhedma prastut gariyeko siddhanta anusar, himsrak vyahahar bhayeko manine jatiya rupmaa alpasankhyak samuha ko balak lai huna sakchha?","The correct answer is **B: balak himsrak vyahahar ma samlagna hune sambhavana badhi hunchha** (The child's likelihood of being involved in violent behavior increases).

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Argument:** The passage states that children from minority groups who are consciously developing awareness of and internalizing prejudice (from both their own and dominant groups) are *more likely* to seek out camaraderie with others who share those prejudices, even if those prejudices lead to violent behavior. The example specifically mentions children from prejudiced minority groups seeking out like-minded individuals, implying a potential for escalating conflict.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: balak himsrak vyahahar ma samlagna huna bata jogina sakchha** (The child cannot be involved in violent behavior): This is too absolute. The passage suggests an *increased likelihood*, not impossibility.
    * **C: balak samajik paristhitiharubata tadha huna khojneychha** (The child is looking for justification from social situations): While social context is important, the passage focuses on the *internalization* of prejudice and the search for like-minded individuals, not just external justification.
    * **D: balak anya jatiya alpasankhyakharusanga ghulmil huna aswikar garnechha** (The child refuses to mingle with other minority groups): This isn't the primary point. The passage focuses on aligning with those who share prejudiced views, regardless of whether they are within the same minority group.



Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the argument presented in the passage."
"anuchhedko anusar, nimna madhey kun kura ma ek balakko jatiya rudhiwadi dharanako gyanley asar garna sakchha?","The correct answer is **B: uniharuko vyavahar (their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""jatiya rudhiwadiharule wyawaharlai asar gardacha"" which translates to ""nationalist tendencies affect behavior"". It goes on to give the example of children from nationally marginalized groups encountering prejudices *in their behavior* when trying to perform well in school.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uuniharuley pahichan garna rojeko jatiya alpasankhyak sanga (their recognition of the nationally marginalized group):** The passage states children *are* from a marginalized group, but it's the effect on their *actions* that's highlighted.
* **C: anya bachchaharu sangako sambandha (relationships with other children):** While relationships could be *affected* by the rudhiwadi dharana, the passage focuses on how it impacts their own behavior.
* **D: uniharuko jaatko paribhasha (the definition of their caste):** The passage isn't about the definition of caste, but the *effects* of nationalist/casteist prejudice.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kura ek asabhya bachha ko palanposan sanga mildaina?","The correct answer is **B: ramro kurakani garney khubi (the ability to tell good stories)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The passage describes ""asabhya bachchaharu"" (uncivilized children) as neglected, abused, and often abandoned. It details the hardships they face, including physical abuse and abandonment, and compares their treatment to that of animals - a lack of empathy and care. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* suggested by the text:

*   **A: swatantra rupma bachnu (surviving independently):** The passage implies these children are often forced to fend for themselves after abandonment.
*   **C: ekanta manparauney baniharu (becoming accustomed to solitude):** Due to neglect and abuse, they likely become isolated and comfortable being alone.
*   **D: samajik chinta (social concern):** The text highlights their *lack* of socialization and how they are *not* integrated into society. This indirectly suggests a lack of social concern *for* them, and they themselves would not develop it easily.

The passage *does not* mention anything about these children having storytelling abilities.  It focuses solely on their negative experiences and lack of proper upbringing.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kura le bachchaharuma asabhya vyavahar ko varnan garchha?","The correct answer is **B: asabhya vyavahar samajik ghulmilko kamibata utpanna huna sakchha** (Untamed behavior can arise from a lack of social integration).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Samajikaranko mahatwalai spashta parna prayog garine sabaibhanda samanya tarikaharumadhe ek bhaneko balbalikaharu badhdai garda wayaskaharudwara samajikrit nabhaera upeksha..."" (One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is when children, growing up without being socialized by adults, are neglected...). This directly links a *lack of socialization* to untamed/uncivilized behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: adhikamsha asabhya vyavahar sharirik kharabiko karanley hunchha** (Most untamed behavior is caused by physical impairment) - While the passage mentions physical disabilities as *a reason* some children are abandoned, it doesn't state it's the *most common* cause of untamed behavior.
* **C: asabhya vyavahar keval uniharuko abhibhawakley thunera rakheka bachchaharu ma prabal chha** (Untamed behavior is only strong in children abandoned by their parents) - The passage also discusses children abused or severely mistreated who might become untamed, not *just* those abandoned.
* **D: sabai asabhya vyavahar dherai maanasik apangata le garda hunchha** (All untamed behavior is caused by severe mental disability) - Similar to A, the passage links mental/physical disability to abandonment, but not as the sole cause of untamed behavior.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines *nirvahmukhi krishi* (subsistence farming) as simple, often organic, relying on local seeds, and environmentally sound.**  It's about meeting the needs of the farmer and their family.
* **Option C describes a focus on *high yield* using *developed methods*.** This is the opposite of the simplicity and reliance on natural methods characteristic of subsistence farming.  Subsistence farming isn't about maximizing profit through high yields, it's about self-sufficiency.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with subsistence farming:

* **A: krishakko parivarko awashyaktalai pura garney ubjai dhyan kendrit garne** (focusing on produce to meet the family's needs) – This is the *definition* of subsistence farming.
* **B: arulai bechna khaneykura utpadan garnu** (producing for both sale and consumption) – While primarily for family needs, some surplus might be sold. This is common in subsistence farming.
* **D: krishakko kshetrako local beejharu prayog garnu** (using local seeds on the farmer's land) – The passage specifically mentions the use of local seeds as a characteristic of subsistence farming.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aitihasik rupma adhikansh kisanharu nirvaha krishima sanlagna thiye ra ajhai pani vikasonmukh deshharuma yastai mamila raheko cha.""  This translates to: ""Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence farming and this is still the case in developing countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yo purai jaivik pranali ho** (This is a completely organic system) - The passage states it's *usually* organic, but doesn't claim it's *completely* organic.
* **B: bali utpadan adhiktam banauna yesley farak tarikaharu prayog garcha** (This uses different techniques to maximize crop production) -  The passage explicitly states it uses *simpler* techniques, not techniques for maximizing yield (""adhikatam upajko lagi any apekshakrit saral praidhiharu"").
* **C: yesley krishivid haru lai afno bali lai purai kshetra ma sajha garna dinchha** (This allows farmers to share their crops across the entire field) -  The passage doesn't mention anything about sharing crops.

Therefore, option D is the only one accurately reflected in the provided text.

The passage states: ""Kunai tyasto awasthama wyakti ek sthanma janchhan june aaram lynn ra ramailoka lagi hunchha june uniharuko niyamit dainik jiwanbhanda bhanda farak hunchha. ... Kunai wyakti kunai khas thaaunko bhramanko uddeshya yasako itihas ra sanskriti zanne ho bhane yass prakarko paryatanlai sanskritik paryatan bhanera chininchha."" (When someone travels to a place to relax and have fun, different from their daily life... If the purpose of traveling to a specific place is to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.)

Museums (sangralay) are inherently linked to history and culture. Visiting a museum is done to learn about the past and cultural artifacts. Therefore, museum visits fall under the category of cultural tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vyavasaya prayatan (business tourism):** This relates to travel for work or conferences.
*   **B: manoranjan paryatan (recreational tourism):** While museums *can* be enjoyable, the primary motivation isn’t just fun; it’s learning. Recreational tourism focuses on leisure and entertainment like beaches and theme parks.
*   **D: bahiri paryatan (ecotourism):** This focuses on traveling to natural environments.



"
"anuchhedko anusar, manorajnako lagi yatra garneyharuko prathamikta ma ke huna sakcha?","The correct answer is **B: uniharuko dainiki bata chutti linu** (to take a break from their daily routine).

Here's why:

The passage states that recreational tourism is when people travel ""to relax and have fun, which is different from their regular daily lives."" This directly indicates that the priority for those traveling for recreation is to *escape* their daily routine and find relaxation and enjoyment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sthaniya sanskritima bhijnu** (to immerse in local culture) - This describes *cultural tourism*, not recreational tourism.
* **C: mahatwapurna sthalharu hernu** (to see important places) - While recreational tourists *might* see important places, it's not their primary goal.
* **D: euta thauko itihash bujhnu** (to understand the history of a place) - This also describes *cultural tourism*.

anuchhed anusar kun kura le local churchbhitra dar kam garna maddat garyo?,"The correct answer is **D: sangathanko itihas bujhera** (understanding the history of the organization).

The passage explicitly states: ""Kasaiko itihas bujhda sanskriti bujhieko manindaina, yasale kamtima manislai sangathanko itihasabhitra uniharu kahan chuke bhane bodh hasil garna maddat garchha."" (Just as understanding someone's history is understanding their culture, it helps people understand where they went wrong within the organization's history).

This directly links understanding the history to being able to work better within the organization.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: safal udayamshil vyavahar ko samjhna garera** (understanding successful entrepreneurial practices) - While mentioned, it's framed as inspiring new directions, not directly *helping* work within the church.
*   **B: sangathanko sanskritilai prabhav parney manisharu bare antardrishti prapta garera** (gaining insight into people who influence the organization's culture) - This provides insight, but isn't the primary way to improve work *within* the church.
*   **C: sangathanko prerak shakti patta lagayera** (identifying the organization's motivating forces) -  Similar to A, this is about understanding the broader mission, not necessarily direct work capability.

"anuchhed anusar, afno itihas bujhnaley ke kurama maddat garna sakchha?","The correct answer is **A: pariwartan sambandhi dar ghatayera** (by reducing fear regarding change).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yasta safaltaka kathaharule bhawishyako pariwartantarfa sakaratmak jhukawa sirjana gardai pariwartanko darlai come garae."" This directly translates to: ""Such success stories create a positive inclination towards future changes and reduce fear of change.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: manyataharu laai ajha baliyo banayera** (by making beliefs even stronger) - The passage doesn't focus on strengthening existing beliefs.
* **C: sangathanbhitra thau fela pareko anubhav diyera** (by giving an experience of finding a place within the organization) - While understanding history *can* help with organizational belonging, it's not the main point here.
* **D: udayamshil vyavaharma sudhar lyayera** (by bringing improvements to entrepreneurial behavior) -  The passage mentions entrepreneurial examples, but improving behavior isn't the core benefit of understanding history.

nimna madhey kun kathanley sikaiko pachhilo adhunik drishtikonlai sahi tarikaley warnan gardachha?,"The correct answer is **D: sikaima kunai kura nirapekshya hudaina** (In learning, nothing is irrelevant).

Here's why:

The passage argues that learning isn't just about grand experiences or practical application (like rebuilding houses or archaeological digs). It emphasizes that even *small* or *seemingly insignificant* experiences (like watching educational TV) contribute to learning.  The author points out that even passive consumption of information, or remembering something faint, is still a form of learning. The passage explicitly states there isn't a ""bad way to learn"" and that learning is the experience *between* what is learned and what is presented. This directly supports the idea that everything has the *potential* to be relevant in the learning process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kehi sikaai anubhavharu anya bhanda faidajank hunchhan** (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others) - The passage doesn't explicitly say that *some* are more beneficial, it just says *all* contribute.
* **B: sikai hamiley anubhav garney bishwas lageko kuraharuma kendrit hunuparchaa** (Learning should focus on things we believe we can experience) - The passage argues against this by highlighting that learning can happen through observation (TV) without direct participation.
* **C: kunai tarikaharu anya bhanda ramro hunchhan** (Some methods are better than others) -  The passage actually suggests there *isn't* a single ""good"" way to learn.

nimna madhey kun kathanley sikaaiko pachhilo adhunik drishtikonlai sahi tarikaley jhalkaudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: kunai bishesh sikai anubhavharulai anya bhanda badhi mahatwa dinuparcha** (giving special importance to one learning experience over others).

Here's why:

The passage critiques the idea that passively watching educational television is a *sufficient* or even particularly *valuable* form of learning. It emphasizes that learning is an *experience* – a cycle of doing, knowing, and applying.  It specifically contrasts watching TV with *actual* application of knowledge (rebuilding, experimenting, etc.).

Option B directly contradicts this. The passage implies that *all* learning experiences have value, and that simply prioritizing one (like passively watching TV) is a flawed approach. The passage suggests learning needs to be active and applied, not just received.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage's ideas:

* **A: jankari line dherai tarikaharu hunchhan** (There are many ways to obtain information) - The passage doesn't deny this, it just argues that *some* ways are more effective than others.
* **C: sikaiko anubhavharu sikney ra prastut gyanma nirbhar hunchha** (Learning experiences depend on learning and presenting knowledge) - This aligns with the passage's discussion of the cycle of knowledge and experience.
* **D: hamiley kahiley pani prayog nagarney gyan pani sikna yogya hunchha** (Even knowledge gained without experimentation is learnable) - The passage acknowledges passively received information *is* information, but it's less valuable than applied knowledge. It doesn't say it's *not* learning.



Therefore, **B** is the statement the passage would most strongly disagree with."
"samanya nindra awadhiko bela jabarjasti uthe pachhi, yi madhye kunley nindra hastekshep prakriyama maddat gardachha?","The correct answer is **B: shauchalaya ko prayog garney ani turuntai feri sutna janey** (Using the toilet and immediately trying to go back to sleep).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions using the urge to urinate (from drinking fluids) as a biorhythm-based option to force yourself awake, then go back to sleep. This aligns directly with the idea of getting up to use the toilet and then trying to fall back asleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: pheri nidauna aghi dedh ghanta padhney** (Reading for an hour and a half before trying to sleep again) - The passage focuses on short interruptions (10-60 minutes), not a long reading session.
*   **C: aafno palangko tablema bhayeko alarm banda garney ani biss minute pachhi sutney** (Turning off the alarm on your bedside table and sleeping again after ten minutes) - This describes resetting the alarm, which the passage says *hinders* the process.
*   **D: palang chheu ko tablema bhayeko bottle bata pani khaney** (Drinking water from a bottle on your bedside table) - While drinking water *is* mentioned in the passage, it’s as a method to *wake you up* to use the bathroom, not as the main intervention itself."

"jaba dimagley lagatar spasta sapana dekhna prayash garda, ke birdhi huncha?","The correct answer is **D: REM charan bichko samaya** (The time within REM cycles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Prati raat thorai REM harusanga, tapainle wastawik nindrako anubhav garnuhane ra tapainko sharira niko hune yo awastha mushkille matri samasya banchha."" (You need some REM every night to experience restorative sleep and this state where your body rests is a difficult problem).  And it goes on to describe how trying to have vivid dreams (implying forcing more REM) leads to waking up frequently.

Therefore, when the brain continuously *tries* to have vivid dreams, it increases the *time spent in REM cycles* as it's actively attempting to prolong that state.  The passage directly links the attempt to have constant vivid dreams to disrupting sleep due to extended REM periods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM charanko matra** (Just REM cycles) - The passage isn't about *just* having REM, but the *attempt to increase* it.
* **B: urja sthar** (Energy levels) - While sleep affects energy, the passage focuses on the sleep cycle disruption.
* **C: swasthalabh hune avadhi** (Duration of health benefits) -  This isn’t directly addressed in the text.



"
lagatar spasta sapana dekhda kasto nakaratmak asar huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **A: REM charanharu bichko samayma ghatawat** (Reduction in time within REM cycles).

Here's why:

The passage explains that frequent, vivid dreams (likely due to extended time in REM sleep) lead to feeling tired as if you haven't slept well. This happens because you're essentially experiencing a lot of mental activity *during* sleep, which disrupts the restorative process.  The passage also states that you wake up every 20-30 minutes, suggesting fragmented sleep. This fragmentation is a *result* of spending too much time in REM. Therefore, the negative effect is a **reduction in the effective time within REM cycles** to achieve restorative sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: harek raat REMharuko ghatawat** (Reduction in REM cycles every night): The passage doesn't say the *number* of REM cycles decreases, but that the *time spent within* those cycles is problematic.
* **C: spasta sapanama nirbhar** (Dependence on vivid dreams): The passage frames vivid dreams as a *symptom* of the problem, not the cause of dependence.
* **D: harek raat REMharuma birdhi** (Increase in REM cycles every night): The passage suggests the opposite – the *intensity* and length within REM cycles are the issue, not an increase in their number.

"anuchhed anusaar, paramparagat toliharu ra virtual toliharu kasari samman chhan?","The correct answer is **B: duwai toliharusanga uniharuko dainiki maa bhinna starko swatantrata hunchha** (Both teams have different levels of freedom in their daily work).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Virtual tolly sadasyaharule prayaha afna tatkalin bhautik samuhaka lagi sampark winduko rupma karya gardachan. Tiniharusanga prayaha paramparagat tolly sadasyaharu bhanda badhi swatantrata hunchha kinky tiniharuka toliharu farak samay khetra anusar vet garna sakchhan june uniharuko sthaniya wyawasthapanle nabujhna sakha.""  This directly translates to virtual team members often work as a contact point for their physical teams, and they generally have *more* freedom than traditional team members because their teams can operate across different time zones, which their local management might not understand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: duwai toliharubata samman stharma karya garney asha rakhinchha** (Both teams are expected to work collaboratively) - The passage doesn't focus on collaboration *expectations*, but on the *differences* in how they operate.
* **C: duwai toliharuley adrishya vyavasthapan tolilai report gardachan** (Both teams report to an invisible management team) - The passage specifically states the ""invisible team"" concept applies to *virtual* teams, not traditional ones.
* **D: duwai toliharuley eutai samaya kshetrama karya gardachan** (Both teams work in the same time zone) - The passage directly contradicts this, stating virtual teams *can* work across different time zones.



"
"anuchhedma adharit, paramparagat ra virtual toliharu barey kun kathan sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **C: paramparagat toliharusanga vritual toliharu bhanda kam swatantrata hunchha** (Traditional teams have less freedom than virtual teams).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Tiniharusanga prayaha paramparagat tolly sadasyaharu bhanda badhi swatantrata hunchha kinky tiniharuka toliharu farak samay khetra anusar vet garna sakchhan june uniharuko sthaniya wyawasthapanle nabujhna sakha.**""  This translates to: ""**They often have more freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones which their local management may not understand.**""  

This directly contradicts option C, which claims traditional teams have *more* freedom.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: paramparagat tolilai praya: mathillo starma rakhichha** (Traditional teams generally maintain a physical structure) - The passage implies this by stating virtual teams are different, and members often use their physical location as a point of contact.
*   **B: virtual toliharuley praya: paramparagat toliko lagi sampark winduko rupma karya gardachan** (Virtual teams often act as a point of contact for their physical groups) - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **D: farak samay kshetraley garda virtual toliharulai faida hunchha** (Virtual teams benefit from different time zones) -  The passage states they *can* meet across time zones, implying an advantage.



"
nimna madhey kun samagri siddhantaharuma kendrit chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: vayasakta ma utpanna hune chahana haru** (desires arising from aging).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on motivational theories that explain *why* people are motivated at work, what *needs* they have, and how their *environment* affects their motivation.

*   **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory** (mentioned in the passage) both deal with understanding individual needs (C: antarik gariyeka awashyaktaharu) and how the work environment impacts those needs (B: kasari ekjanako vatavaranley uniharuko karyaharulai asar gardchha).  They aim to understand *what* people want (D: manisharuko chahanaharu bujhnu) to motivate them.

*   **Desires arising from aging (vayasakta ma utpanna hune chahana haru)** is a broader topic related to life stages and evolving preferences, but isn't the central focus of *motivational theories* as described in the passage. While aging might *influence* motivation, it's not a core tenet of the theories discussed.



"
nimna madhey kun tihai niyamko vastu hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: photobhitra jiwan ra urja shrijana garney (creating life and energy within the photo)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes the ""Rule of Thirds"" - a compositional guideline. It focuses on:

*   **Placement of subjects:** Placing key elements at the intersections of lines dividing the image into thirds (C).
*   **Creating a framework:** Establishing lines that guide the eye and create a sense of order (A & D).
*   **Strong focal point:** Identifying the most impactful location for the main subject.

While a good photograph *can* have life and energy, that's a *result* of good composition and subject matter, not a direct part of the Rule of Thirds itself. The Rule of Thirds is a *technique* to achieve a visually pleasing composition, which can then *lead* to a more dynamic and engaging photograph (containing ""life and energy"").

Therefore, option B is the element that doesn't directly define the Rule of Thirds.



"
nimna madhey kunley 35milimeter photography dhanchalai warnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: yosanga dherai sadharan dhanchaharu bhanda bhinnai anupata cha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the 35mm format has an aspect ratio of 3:2 and that *many common formats are equal to or close to this ratio*.  Therefore, it does *not* have a significantly different aspect ratio than many common formats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yo ajhai utpadan ma cha** - The passage states ""Yo az pani utpadan garieko cha"" (This is still in production).
*   **B: yaslai digital camera dhanchaharuldwaara grahan garieko thiyo** - The passage mentions the aspect ratio is now commonly created by digital camera sensors.
*   **D: yo sansar ma sabaibhanda samanya dhancha ho** - While the passage states it was the *dominant* film format at the end of the analog era, it doesn't say it's the *most common* format overall. It says it was the most common *at that time*.

"annuched anusaar, utpadakharuley lens utpadanko gunastar badhauda, zoom lens kasari sudhar bhayeko cha?","Correct answer is **C: tiniharuko photo gunastar sthir focal lambai vayeko lensharu sanga saman chhan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lens utpadakharule lensko utpadanma uccha gunastar prapta garepachhi yo samasya come hundai gairaheko cha. Yasale zoom lenslai nishchit focal lambaika sath lensdwara prapta tulaniya gunastarko tasbir nikalna garna anumati dinchha.""

This means that when manufacturers improve the quality of lens production, zoom lenses can achieve image quality comparable to fixed focal length (prime) lenses.  Therefore, the improvement makes their photo quality similar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tiniharusanga jhan dherai lens gati cha** - The passage mentions aperture (speed) as a *disadvantage* of zoom lenses, not an improvement.
*   **B: tiniharu laai kam prakash bhayeko awasthama prayog garna sajilo bhayeko cha** - The passage states low light is a *problem* with zoom lenses.
*   **D: tiniharusanga prime lensharu bhanda kam focal jatilta chhan** - The passage states zoom lenses *have* more complex focal lengths, not less."
"anuched anusar, kun awasthama prime lens bhanda zoom lens ruchaina sakcha?","Correct answer is **A: yedi dherai adhikatam aperture prathamikta ho bhaney**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lensko adhikatam appeture (gati) prayaha come hune bhaera zoom lensko arko ghata ho."" This directly translates to ""A further disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) is often smaller."" 

This means if a large maximum aperture is important to you (for low-light photography or shallow depth of field), a prime lens would be preferable to a zoom lens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage states zoom lenses *have more* elements than prime lenses, so wanting fewer elements would favor a prime lens. However, this isn't the primary issue raised in the passage regarding when a zoom lens is less desirable.
*   **C:** The passage says zoom lenses can be difficult to use in low light *because* of the smaller aperture, not that flash use makes them preferable.
*   **D:** Zoom lenses are *defined* by their variable focal length – the passage explains this at the beginning. If you're looking for a specific focal length, a prime lens would be more suited, but the passage primarily highlights the aperture issue."
nimna madhey kun rahasyawadko sahi varnan manindaina?,"The most accurate description of Mysticism (Rahasyawad) based on the provided text is **B: rahasyawadko anuyayiharuley adhyatmik satyako sachet jagarukta khojchhan** (Followers of Mysticism seek conscious awareness of spiritual truth).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Rahasyawad bhaneko ek khoj ho... adhyatmik satya wa ishwarko sachet jagarukat ho."" (Mysticism is a search... for spiritual truth or God's conscious awakening).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A:** While Mysticism *can* involve peaceful and joyful states, it's not its defining characteristic.  The text describes it as a *search* that *can lead* to those states.
* **C:** Developing intuition is *a way* Mystics might approach the search, but not the core definition itself.
* **D:**  The text states Mysticism *distinguishes itself* from other religions by focusing on direct personal experience, not by aligning with them.



Therefore, **B** is the closest and most direct reflection of the definition given in the passage.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun rahasyawadko mudda hoina?","The correct answer is **B: sajha, samjik anubhavmarfat antardrishti anusaran garney** (following intuition through shared, social experiences).

Here's why:

The passage describes Rahasyawad (Mysticism) as a *personal* quest for direct experience, intuition, and understanding of divine reality. It emphasizes individual, internal experiences (""pratyaksha anubhav,"" ""antargyan"").  It highlights a connection to a higher power *individually*.

Let's break down why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: ishwari satyatama antargyan khojney** (searching for divine truth through intuition) - This is a core element of the definition provided.
*   **C: antargyanko anandamaya awasthama jod** (connecting to a blissful state of intuition) - The passage specifically mentions ""paramanand"" (supreme bliss) as a characteristic of mystical experience.
*   **D: bhagwanko sachet jagarukta anusaran garney** (following the conscious awakening of God) - The passage explicitly states Rahasyawad is about realizing God's awareness.

Option B, however, focuses on *shared* and *social* experiences. The passage centers on *individual* experience and direct connection. Therefore, it's the one that doesn't fit the description of Rahasyawad as presented in the text.

"anuchhed anussar, krishi samaj kasley suruwat gareko huna sakchha?","The correct answer is **D: mukhya bhumiko maori**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siddhantale tyasapachhi maori janata polynesiabata great flitma sareko ra morioribata newzealand pugeko ra krishi samajko sthapana gareko vichar gare."" This translates to: ""The theory considered that the Maori people came from Polynesia by great flight and settled in New Zealand via the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states the Maori people (from the mainland - *mukhya bhumi*) established the agricultural society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: new zealandko moriori** - The passage suggests the Moriori *were* settled by Maori, not the originators of agriculture.
*   **B: chatham taapuko moriori** - Similar to A, the Moriori of Chatham Island were a distinct group with a peaceful culture that developed *after* settling there.
*   **C: polynesiako maori manisharu** - While the Maori originated in Polynesia, the passage specifically says they established agriculture *in New Zealand* after arriving.



"
"anuchhed anusar, moaharuko shikar garney toli pahilo vasindaharu kun sthanka thiye?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Newzealandka pratham basinda maori manisharu thee ra uniharule moas bhane vishal charako shikar gareka thee..."" (The first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people and they hunted giant birds called moas...). 

This directly indicates that the moa hunting took place in New Zealand. The passage then goes on to discuss the Maori migrating *from* New Zealand to the Chatham Islands.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Peorland origami...jasma ekpatakma ek choti matra patyauna sakinchha..."" (Peorland origami...where only a small number of folds can be made on a single sheet...). This directly implies it's beneficial for folders who are beginners or have limited dexterity, meaning they can manage only a few folds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: folderley ekaipatakma dherai patyauna ruchauda** (The folder wants to make many folds on a single sheet) - Peorland origami *restricts* the number of folds.
* **B: foldersanga vikashit motor sipharu chha** (The folder has developed motor skills) - Peorland origami was created for those *lacking* advanced motor skills.
* **C: folderley origami srijana gari raheko cha jasma ulto patyauna awashyak cha** (The folder is creating origami that requires reverse folds) - Peorland origami *specifically avoids* complex folds like reverse folds.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Peorland origami was developed to help **inexperienced folders** and those with **limited motor skills**.  Therefore, saying it's *for experienced folders* directly contradicts the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: yas tarikama ultobata patyauney samawesh hudaina** (Folding backwards is not included in this technique) - This is stated directly in the description of Peorland origami.
* **C: patyauda sidha sthanharu hunuparcha** (The folds must be straight) -  This is also explicitly stated as a key characteristic of Peorland origami.
* **D: yo simit motor sipharu bhayeka folderharuko lagi ramro tarika ho** (This is a good technique for folders with limited motor skills) -  The passage says it was *developed* to help this group.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, kun sthan sindhu ghati sabhyatasanga sambandhit chaina?","Correct answer is **B: saraswati nadi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *some* scholars believe there *may* have been settlements in the dried-up Saraswati river basin, and suggest calling the civilization ""Sindhu-Saraswati"". However, it doesn't state Saraswati nadi was a central location *of* the civilization itself, only that it *might* have been associated with it. The passage clearly identifies the Sindhu (Indus) River as the core geographical feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: harappa** - The passage explicitly mentions Harappa as the first site excavated and the origin of the name ""Harappa Civilization"" for the same civilization.
*   **C: afaghanistanko uttarpurviko sabhai kshetraharu** - The passage states the civilization included ""some areas of northeastern Afghanistan"".
*   **D: adhunik yugko sabaijasto pakistan** - The passage states the civilization included ""modern-day Pakistan"".



"
nimna madhey anuchhedma ullekhit gariyeko kun nam kans yug sabhyatako naam huna sambhav chaina?,"Correct answer is **A: harappan sabhyata**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the civilization was *first* called the Harappan civilization because Harappa was the first site excavated in the 1920s. However, it also describes it as the Indus Valley Civilization (Sindhu Ghati Sabhyata) and mentions the possibility of it being called the Indus-Saraswati civilization by some scholars.  ""Sindhu Nadi Sabhyata"" (Indus River Civilization) is a direct description of where the civilization flourished.

Harappan is a *name given based on the first discovery*, not a potential name for the broader civilization itself as suggested by scholars. Therefore, it's the least likely to be a proposed name for the ancient civilization described in the passage."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley dirghakalin faida dincha?","The correct answer is **A: arusanga sahakarya garera** (by cooperating with each other).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Asha cha uniharuko dirghakalin uttam vikalpa arusanga miller cam garnu bhanera dherai manisharule mahasus gurney chan."" This translates to ""Many people feel that their best long-term option is to cooperate and work together.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aafno wyaktigat swartha lai prathamikta diyera** (prioritizing one's own self-interest) - The passage suggests love and self-interest *always* exist, but cooperation is the path to long-term benefit.
* **C: bahumatlai bhanda alpasankhyalai faida huney chijlai prathamikta diyera** (prioritizing benefiting minorities over the majority) -  The passage doesn't mention anything about prioritizing minorities.
* **D: lobh faidajanak huncha bhanera pahichan garera** (recognizing that greed is profitable) - The passage mentions taking advantage of situations, but frames it as a natural aspect of behavior, not something to actively pursue for long-term gain.

"anuchhed anusar, yedi kasailai turunttai faida chaiyeko cha vaney nimna madhey kasailey ke kuralai prathamikta dincha?","The correct answer is **D: swartha (self-interest)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that people often prioritize self-interest (""swartha"") even when cooperation (""sahakarya"") and love exist, and that this is a natural tendency when seeking quick gains (""bahumatle labh uthaunda chhoto awadhima"").  It highlights how individuals are motivated to maximize their own benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ni:swarthata (altruism):** The passage directly contrasts self-interest with selfless behavior, suggesting altruism is *not* the priority when immediate profit is desired.
*   **B: sahayog (cooperation):** While cooperation is mentioned, the passage indicates it's often overshadowed by self-interest in the short term.
*   **C: sahakarya (collaboration):** Similar to cooperation, collaboration isn't prioritized over immediate gains driven by self-interest.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uccha madhya yug suruwati madhya yugbhanda bhanda aghadi suru bhayo..."" which translates to ""The High Middle Ages began *before* the Early Middle Ages..."" 

Therefore, the Early Middle Ages came before the Templar period (which falls within the High Middle Ages).
"
kun samay awadhi templursko yug pachhi ayeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: pachhilo madhya yug (Late Middle Ages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (which includes the time of the Templars - 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries) was *followed by* the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ends around 1500.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 12aun shatabdi (12th century):** This is *within* the High Middle Ages, not *after* it.
*   **C: uccha madhya yug (High Middle Ages):** This is the period the Templars were *in*, not what came after.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses Roman medical practices like using morphine, scopolamine, tourniquets, and amputation. It explicitly mentions these as treatments used by Roman doctors and surgeons.
* There is *no mention* of treating post-traumatic stress disorder or using sedatives for that purpose in the provided text.  The Romans didn't have the modern understanding of psychological trauma or the tools to treat it as we do today.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: scopolomineko lagi herbaneko biuko jholharuko prayog (use of herbal decoctions for scopolamine)** - The text specifically states they knew about scopolamine derived from henbane.
* **C: raktapraaha roknaka lagi dhamani clampharuko prayog (use of arterial clamps to stop bleeding)** -  The text states they were skilled at using arterial clamps to control bleeding.
* **D: gangreen bhayeka biramiharukolagi anga bichheden garthe (amputation for patients with gangrene)** - The text directly mentions amputation as a method to save patients from gangrene.

dekhney khubi ke ma nirbhar chha?,"The correct answer is **A: drishya pranali sanwedanashik ang** (visual system sensory organs).

**Explanation:**

The passage begins by stating: ""Drishti wa herne kshamata drishya pranali sanwedanashik ang wa ankhama nirbhar garchha."" This directly translates to ""The ability to see depends on the visual system sensory organs or eyes.""  Therefore, the ability to see fundamentally relies on these organs.

* **C: kunai bisesh vebh-lambaiharusanga sanvedanshilta** (Sensitivity to specific wavelengths) - This is a *characteristic* of sight, not what sight depends on.

"
jiwaharu bichko ankhako bhinnata kemaa nirbhar huncha?,"The correct answer is **B: jiwako awashyaktaharu** (the needs of the organism).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jiwa ko awashyaktama nirbhar bhaera aankha ekbhanda dherai nirmanharu hune garchhan."" (Depending on the needs of the organism, the eye has many structures.) This directly links the differences in eye structure to the requirements of the organism.

* **A: vebhlambaiharusanga sanvedanshilta (sensitivity to wavelengths)** - While wavelength sensitivity *is* a factor in eye structure, the passage states it's a function of the *different structures* within the eye, not the primary reason for differences *between* organisms' eyes.
* **C: tikshnatako star (degree of sharpness)** - Sharpness is a *result* of eye structure, not the driving force behind *why* different organisms have different structures.
* **D: jiwako jatilta (complexity of the organism)** - While more complex organisms might have more complex eyes, the passage emphasizes *needs* as the primary driver, not simply overall complexity.

"anuchhed anusar, sikh sambadhi kun kathanley tyas dharmalai sahi tarikaley darshaudaina?","The correct answer is **B: guru sikhsangako matra anupam adhar ho**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""guru sabai bharatiya dharmaharuka lagi ek adharbhut paksh ho tar sikh dharma ek mahatwako rupma lieko cha jasle sikh wishwasharuko mull roop banaunchha."" (Guru is a fundamental aspect for all Indian religions, but Sikhism has taken a significant form that forms the basis of Sikh believers.) This means gurus are *an important* base, but not the *only* base. The passage emphasizes that Sikhism has its own unique foundation (""mull roop"").

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: hindu paramparabhitra raheko sampradayik vibhajanko karan** (the reason for sectarian division within Hindu traditions) - The passage explicitly states Sikhism *originated* from a sectarian split within Hinduism in the Punjab region.
* **C: nau guruharuley dharmako sthapankarta, guru nanakko pachi lage** (nine gurus followed Guru Nanak as successors) - The passage clearly states, ""yasama aru nau guruharu uttaradhikarko rupma rahe."" (and nine other gurus followed as successors.)
* **D: sikhako kunai paramparaharu hindu dharmasanga jadit cha** (some Sikh traditions are rooted in Hinduism) - The passage states ""Yadyapi uniharule yasalai hindu mull ra paramparalai swikar gareta pani..."" (Although they accepted Hindu roots and traditions...)



Therefore, option B is the statement that the passage *does not* accurately reflect."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun sikh dharma pranaliko mul swarup manincha?","The correct answer is **A: guruko awadharana (the concept of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sikhharule afno dharmalai gurmat bhandachhan, june panjavima """"guruko marg"""" ho."" (Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which means ""the way of the Guru"".) and ""guru sabai bharatiya dharmaharuka lagi ek adharbhut paksh ho tar sikh dharma ek mahatwako rupma lieko cha jasle sikh wishwasharuko mull roop banaunchha."" (The Guru is a fundamental aspect for all Indian religions, but Sikhism has taken a significant form that has become the core of Sikh beliefs.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hindu paramparaharu (Hindu traditions):** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism *originated* within Hindu traditions, it explicitly states Sikhs differentiate themselves from Hinduism.
* **C: anya bharatiya dharmaharulai swikar garna aswikar (refusal to accept other Indian religions):** The passage doesn't suggest rejection, only distinction.
* **D: punjabi bhasha bolnu (speaking Punjabi):**  While Punjabi is the language of the region where Sikhism originated, the passage doesn't identify language as the fundamental core of the religion.

"anuchhed anusar, dhyan kami hune gadbadi vayeka bachchaharulai ke kurama dhyan kendrit garna gahro huncha?","The correct answer is **A: vidyalaya karya** (school work).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ADD bhaeka bachchaharusanga vidyalayako karya dhyan dine karya gahro hunchha..."" which translates to ""For children with ADD, school work is difficult to concentrate on..."". 

The passage then *contrasts* this with things they *can* focus on – playing games, watching cartoons, writing sentences without punctuation – to highlight the difficulty they have with schoolwork.



"
"anuchhed anusar, dhyan kami hune gadbadi vayeka bachchaharu kina jokhimpurna vyavahar garney gardachhan?","The correct answer is **D: uniharuko dimaglai uttejit garna** (to stimulate their brains).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yasale dherai samasyama parna uniharu """"jokhimpurna wyawaharma, jhagadama samel hunchhan ra adhikarik wargalai chunauti dinchhan"""". ADDley any sahapathiharusangko sambandhalai prabhawa pardachha kinbhane any bachchaharule tiniharule gurney tarikale kinn tiniharule karya garchhan wa tiniharule gurney tarikale kinn tiniharule uchcharan garchhan wa tiniharuko paripakwata star bhinna cha bhane kura bujhna sakdainan.""  This implies that because their brains *need* stimulation and aren't stimulated in typical ways, they resort to risky behavior, arguing, and challenging authority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uccha gatividhi kam garna** (having low activity) - The passage describes them as having *high* activity (uccha gatividhi), not low.
*   **B: sathibhaiharu sanga ghulmil hunako lagi** (to mix with friends) - The passage states they have difficulty with peer relationships *because* of their ADD, not to become more integrated.
*   **C: uniharuko abhibhawakharuko dhyan khichhna** (to attract their parents' attention) - While possible, the passage doesn’t specifically state this as the *reason* for risky behavior. It focuses on the brain's need for stimulation.



"
"anuchhedma bhayeko jankariko adharma, nimna madhye kun machanko udharharan hoina?","The correct answer is **D: euta sano league prashikshak (a little league coach)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""machan"" (scaffolds) as support systems for learning *new* things - like a new computer program or a new project. They are tools or guides that help someone through a challenging process.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of ""machan"":

* **A: computer khelko suruwatma bhayeko sikaai (learning to start a computer game):**  A tutorial or in-game help system would be a scaffold.
* **B: SAT prashikshak (SAT tutor):** A tutor provides guidance and support during the learning process for the SAT.
* **C: euta swatantra aadhayan karyakram (an independent study program):**  While seemingly independent, a well-designed independent study program often includes built-in supports, checkpoints, and resources – acting as a scaffold.

However, **a little league coach** (D) primarily focuses on developing *existing* skills and teamwork within a familiar context (baseball). While valuable, they aren't necessarily helping someone learn something entirely *new* in the way the passage describes ""machan."" They focus on refining skills, not initial acquisition.



"
nimna madhey kunley machanko avadharanalai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: yeslai paryiyojanama adharit sikai pani vanincha** (It also calls project-based learning).

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that project-based learning *uses* scaffolding to make learning easier and more engaging. It doesn't say scaffolding *is* project-based learning, but rather a tool *within* it. The passage describes scaffolding as a support system *for* learning new things, including starting new projects.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: machan virtually awasthit huna sakcha** (Scaffolding can exist virtually) - The text explicitly mentions virtual scaffolding (""Virtual scaffolds suftwearma antarikaran garieko cha..."")
* **B: yo sikney vidhibhanda pani dherai sahayata ho** (This is more help than the learning method itself) - The passage states scaffolding is ""baru ek sahayata ho jasle tee wyaktiharulai samarthan pradan gardacha"" (an additional aid that provides support).
* **D: machanlai sikai anubhavko suruwatma samarthan pradhan garnakolagi prayog garincha** (Scaffolding is used to provide support at the beginning of the learning experience) - This is a core idea of the text – scaffolding supports those starting new tasks like computer programs or projects.

"Anuchhed anusar texas kaa nagarik lai sambodhan garda, governor le kasto aashwasana dienan?","The correct answer is **B: Janata ko suraksha ko laagi kadam haru chalieka chhan** (Steps are being taken to protect public safety).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Unle tee adhikariharusangai texuska nagarikharulai janatako surakshalai raksha garna kadam chalieko ashwasana die."" This directly translates to ""Unle assured the citizens of Texas that steps are being taken to protect public safety along with officials.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pranali le ramrari kaam gareko chhaina** (The system is not working well) - While Unle acknowledges potential issues (""pranali tyahi tarahako cam gariraheko cha""), the initial assurance is about *taking steps* to fix things, not admitting failure.
*   **C: Uniharu chunauti ko saamana garna susajjit chhan** (They are equipped to face the challenge) - The text mentions some places are better equipped, but this isn't the governor's direct assurance to the citizens.
*   **D: visaya gambhir chhaina** (The matter is not serious) - The text explicitly states ""yo mamla gambhir cha"" (this matter is serious), making this option incorrect.



"
UW kaa dui purva vidhyarthi le samachar ko parody garne kun karyakram ko nirman gare?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dheraiaghi da deli sho ra da colbert report, heck ra jonasanle 1988 maa uniharu UW maa vidyarthi hunda samachar ra samachar reportingko anukaran gurney prakashanko kalpana gare. Yasako sthapana pachhi, **onion mudran sanskaranko sathama**, ek yathartha samachar parody samrajya baneko cha..."" (Roughly translates to: ""...and the Colbert Report, Heck and Jonasan imagined a parody of news and news reporting while students at UW in 1988. Following its establishment, **along with The Onion publication**, it became a real news parody empire..."")

The passage clearly identifies The Onion as the creation stemming from the UW students' initial idea. While Colbert Report is mentioned, it's in the context of being *inspired* by the original work, not *being* the original work itself.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun the onion ko samachar parody garne samrajya maa samawesh thiena?","The correct answer is **C: Website**.

Here's why:

The passage states that The Onion evolved into a ""real news parody empire"" that included a website which attracted 5,000,000 unique visitors in October. It also mentions other elements like podcasts and a 24-hour news channel, but the core of the empire, and the first major expansion described, is the website.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vishwa atlas** - While the passage *mentions* a ""world atlas"" as part of their growing universe, it's presented as a later addition, not a core element of the parody empire.
*   **B: Chalchitra** - The passage does not mention any films or movies.
*   **D: Print sanskaran** -  The passage states that The Onion started *with* print versions (the ""onion print editions"") but then grew *beyond* that into a larger empire. It wasn’t the entirety of the empire.



"
Anuchhed anusar prahari le keko surakshya gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Downing street prawesh dwaar**.

The passage states: ""Pradhanmantriko adhikarik niwassthan, **downing stritma praharidwara sanrakshit praeshdwarko** viparit raheko whitehalma..."" which translates to ""The Prime Minister's official residence, **opposite the entrance to Downing Street protected by guards**..."" 

Therefore, the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street.



"
Sawari chap huna nadina prahari le kati bela pradarshankaari haru laai aghi badhna bhaneko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 baje**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""11:20 maa, praharile pradarshankariharulai traffic badhdai gaeko hunda virodh-pradarshanko adhikarlai santulanma rakhna awashyak bhaeko ullekha gardai sadakbhanda bahira sarna anurodh gare.""

This translates to: ""At 11:20, the police requested the protesters to move out of the road, citing the need to balance traffic flow and the right to protest."" 

Therefore, the police asked the protesters to move at 11:20.



"
Dr. Ehud Ur le gareko anusandhan bare ke sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Agadi daibetes bhaeka musa laai aba daibetes chaina** (Previously diabetic mice are now not diabetic).

Here's why:

The text states Dr. Ur's research shows mice *that previously had diabetes are now without it* after 4 months. This directly corresponds to option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agadi type 1 diabetes bhaeka birami laai natija faidajanak cha** (The results are beneficial for patients with previous type 1 diabetes) - The text doesn't state if the results are beneficial *for humans* specifically, only that it worked on mice.  It also cautions the research is very early.
* **C: Uni sakaratmak chhan ki natija le upachar tarfa laijanchha** (He is optimistic that the results will lead to treatment) - While Dr. Ur is a researcher, the text focuses on the finding itself, not his optimism about future treatment.
* **D: Daibetes nabhaeka kehi musa lai ahile daibetes chha** (Some mice that didn't have diabetes now have diabetes) - This is the *opposite* of what the text describes.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, Dr. Ur lai ke maa sankaa chha?","Correct answer: **A: Yadi yea natijaa type 1 diabetes bhaeka manislai sandarbhik chha**

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that Dr. Ur is cautious about the findings *if they don't apply to people who already have type 1 diabetes*. He's worried the results might be misleading if they only work for a specific group.  The phrase ""kehi any vigyaharu jastai uni pani madhumeha niko hoon sakha key bhanera shankaspad chan"" directly reflects this concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yadi upachar sambhav chha:** The passage doesn't mention Dr. Ur doubting the *possibility* of treatment, but rather its applicability.
* **C: Upachar sambandhi aru visesagya ko dharana:** The passage doesn't mention other experts' opinions.
* **D: Yadi daibetes nabhaeko musa tyastai rahancha bhanera:** The passage focuses on whether it applies to those *with* diabetes, not those without.



"
Flight CG4684 ko durghatana baare kun wakyale sahi rupmaa varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Plane le durghatana hunu aghi tin patak awataran garne prayas gareko thiyo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the plane attempted to land *two* times (dosro patak awataran prayas garnuparne) before disappearing.** It does *not* mention three attempts.  The wording ""tin patak"" (three times) is incorrect according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Plane mausam ko karanle awataran garna asafal bhaeko thiyo** - This is true; the passage states the bad weather hindered the landing (""kharaab mausamko karanle akal awataran garaeko thiyo"").
* **B: Plane nikai durgam sthal maa durghatana bhaeko thiyo** - This is true; the passage says reaching the crash site is difficult (""tyahan pugna yati kathina cha"").
* **D: Plane durghatana bhaeko sthaan ko khoji karya lai mausam le asar gareko thiyo** - This is true; the search was hampered by bad weather (""khoj pani tyahi kharab mausamko karanle awarodhit bhaeko thiyo"").



"
Flight CG4684 ko awataran ke karan le rokiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Mausam ko awastha kharab thiyo** (The weather condition was bad).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Khoj pani tyahi kharab mausamko karanle awarodhit bhaeko thiyo jasle akal awataran garaeko thiyo."" (The search was also hindered due to the bad weather which caused the premature landing). This directly links the bad weather to the reason for the attempted/premature landing (and therefore, why the landing was stopped).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Awataran garne sthan maa napugnale** (Unable to reach the landing location) - The text doesn't mention the landing location being unreachable, only that it was difficult to *get to* the crash site.
*   **B: CG4684 aghi thuprai plane haru thie** (CG4684 was behind burning planes) - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Plane laai Kokoda tarfa farkaieko thiyo** (The plane was diverted towards Kokoda) -  While Kokoda is mentioned, the text doesn't say the plane was diverted *to* Kokoda, just that it was near Kokoda.



"
Anuchhed anusaar Franciszek kowal ko anubhav sambandhi kun wakya sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Jhyaal bhatkauna khojdaa unlai chot lagyo** (While trying to break the ice, he got hurt).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...antat: euta flake bhanchiyo ra uniharu jhyalbata bahira niscan thale"" which translates to ""...finally, a flake broke and they were certain to get out of the ice."" This implies that *something* broke (a flake) allowing them to escape, but the wording ""flake broke"" strongly suggests it happened *to* them, causing injury in the process of breaking the ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unle jhyal bhatkaauna safal bhae** (They succeeded in breaking the ice) - While they *eventually* got out, the passage doesn't portray it as a smooth success. It shows struggle and a flake breaking *on them*.
* **B: Unlai kunai chot laagena** (He got injured) - While injury is implied, it's not directly stated. The breaking of the flake *suggests* the injury.
* **C: Bahira niklana khojdaa unle euta kursi bhaache** (While trying to get out, they found a chair) - The passage mentions chairs but doesn't link them to escaping. They were *sitting* on chairs *within* the ice.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate interpretation of Franciszek Kowal's experience based on the provided text."
Ushna pradeshiya toofan danielle ko asar mapan garna kina chunautipurna chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Toofan landfall bata tadha chha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sanyukta rajya america wa caribeanma andhibehari pahirobata tadha bhaekale sambhawit prabhava aklan garna gahro bhaeko cha."" This translates to: ""It is difficult to assess the potential impact of the storm on the United States and the Caribbean because the storm is far from landfall.""  ""Landfall"" means making land.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toofan shaktishaali bhaera aandhi aaune anuman garieko chha** - While the passage *mentions* the storm strengthening, it doesn't explain *why* impact assessment is challenging.
* **B: Vaigyaanik haru toofan maa nirantar chalne batas bare anishchit chhan** - The passage doesn't mention any uncertainty about the winds.
* **D: Toofan miyami bata nikai tadha awasthit chha** - The passage states it's about 3,000 miles away from Miami, meaning it's *not* close.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala dieko madhye kun wakya ushna pradeshiya toofan danielle ko baare sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Caribbean maa yasko asar baare jankaari chhaina** (There is no information about its impact on the Caribbean).

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* mention the potential impact on the Caribbean.** It states: ""Sanyukta rajya america wa caribeanma andhibehari pahirobata tadha bhaekale sambhawit prabhawa aklan garna gahro bhaeko cha"" which translates to ""It is difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States and the Caribbean as the storm approaches.""

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Yo atlantic mahasagar maa baneko thiyo** (It was formed in the Atlantic Ocean) - The passage states: ""ushna pradeshiya toofan daniel purvi atlantic mahasagarma banieko cha"" (tropical storm Daniel formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean).
* **C: Yo andhi maa parinat huna sakchha** (This storm can intensify) - The passage says: ""Rashtriya aandhi kendraka vaigyanikharule deniel andhibehari budhabararasammama jhan shaktishali hunechha bhanera bhavishyavani gare"" (National Hurricane Center scientists have predicted that Daniel will intensify by Wednesday).
* **D: Yo landfall sanga najik chha** (It is close to landfall) - While it doesn’t say it’s *imminent*, it says it’s about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, implying it's still moving and the possibility of landfall exists.



"
"Anuchhed anusar,vishwawyapi mahamari bannu aghi rog laai ke hunu parne sujhaav garieko chha?","The correct answer is **A: Yo kam ghatak bannu parchha** (It needs to become less deadly).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kehi adhyayanle yo rog vishwawyapi mahamariko karan hunubhanda phile **come ghatak hunupardacha** bhanera sujhawa dinchhan."" (Some studies suggest this disease needs to become **less deadly** before it can cause a global pandemic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yaska lakshan halka hunu parchha** (Its symptoms need to be mild) - While the passage mentions symptoms are mild, it doesn't say *that's* what needs to happen to prevent a pandemic, only that mild symptoms allow for continued daily activity and spread.
*   **C: Ajha dherai manchhe sankramit bannu parchha** (Many more people need to be infected) - The passage expresses *concern* about many people being infected, it doesn't suggest it's a requirement for the disease to change.
*   **D: Balbalikale lakshan mahasus garnu parchha** (Children need to feel symptoms) - The passage specifically mentions children being affected, but doesn't link that to preventing a pandemic.



"
Anuchhed anusar fujian bata andhi kati tadha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: 70 kilometer**.

Here's why:

The text states (P) ""August 9 ko ratisamma morakotko aankha chiniyan pranta fujianbata **kariva sattari kilometer** tadha thiyo.""  ""Kariva sattari kilometer"" means approximately 70 kilometers.

Therefore, the storm was 70 kilometers from Fujian province.



"
George w bush asia aaipugda kasle swagat gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ra Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Unlai singapurka upapradhanmantri Wong Kan Sengley swagat gare ra singapurka pradhanmantri lie sien lung (Lee Hsien Loong) sang wyapar ra atankaatankawadsambandhi muddaharuko barema chhalfal gare.""  This means both the Deputy Prime Minister (Wong Kan Seng) *and* the Prime Minister (Lee Hsien Loong) were involved in welcoming President Bush.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pradhan mantri** - While Lee Hsien Loong (the Prime Minister) was involved, Wong Kan Seng was *also* involved.
*   **B: Ek darshak** - The text mentions a ""darshak"" (audience member) in relation to Bush's speech, not his initial welcome.
*   **D: Upa-pradhanmantri** - Only the Deputy Prime Minister isn't the full picture of who welcomed him.



"
Rashtrapati le asia ko wyapar wista bare kahile bole?,"The correct answer is **A: Singapore aae pachhi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Madhyawadhi chunawama hareko ek satapachhi busle ek darshaklai asiako wyaparka wistarko barema batae."" which translates to ""After losing in the midterm elections, Bush told an audience about expanding Asian trade.""  The phrase ""Singapore aae pachhi"" means ""after arriving in Singapore"", and the text places this speech *after* arriving in Singapore and *after* the midterm elections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wong Kan Seng sanga** - He discussed trade with Wong Kan Seng, but didn't *announce* the trade expansion *to* Wong Kan Seng.
*   **C: Madhyavadhi chunawama hare pachhi** - While the speech *happened* after the election, the question asks *when* he spoke about it, not just when it occurred.
*   **D: Unko ek hapta lamo asia ko bhraman bhari** - The speech happened early in the trip, not throughout the whole trip.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun sarkar ko samgra laxya ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo varsha ko march samma maa dhuwani maa thap lagaani garne** (To establish a tap in sound by March this year).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ajko ghoshanale yass warshako marchma sarkarko koshlai thap sahayog gurney pratibadhatalai pani wistar garyo."" (Today's announcement has also expanded the government's commitment to providing taps with funds this March.)
* This directly indicates the government's goal is to install taps (related to sound/water access) by March of this year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kul 300 dhuwani lyaune** (To bring a total of 300 sounds) - The passage mentions 300 *beneficiaries* who will be relieved, not 300 taps being brought.
* **C: Thap 1300 dhuwani lyaune** (To bring 1300 taps) -  The passage says 1300 *sound devices* will be procured, not necessarily taps.  It's ambiguous whether these are taps or other sound-related equipment.
* **D: Dhuwani ko bhid ghataune** (To reduce the pressure of sound) - The passage doesn't mention reducing sound pressure.



"
Sarkar le ke ghosana garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Uniharu ko thap 1300 dhuwani maa lagani garne yojana chha** (They have a plan to invest in 1300 sounds).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Thap 300 ley badhi bhidbhadbata chhutkara paunaka lagi cool 1300 dhuwani sadhana lyaundachha."" This translates to ""300 taps will acquire cool 1300 sound devices to get rid of excessive noise.""  This directly indicates a plan to invest in 1300 sound devices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uniharu ko aru thap 300 dhuwani maa lagani garne yojana chha** - The passage specifies *1300* sound devices, not *300*.
* **B: Uniharu dhuwani ko samasya kam garna pratibada chhan** - While reducing noise is the *goal*, the passage doesn't say they are protesting, it describes an investment plan.
* **D: Bhid ko samasya march samma maa hal hune chha** - The passage doesn't say the noise problem will be solved in March; it only states the government's support and the plan to acquire devices.



"
Anuchhed anusar ke jankari thaha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jokhim ko star ghateko chha** (The level of risk has decreased).

Here's why:

* **P's statement:** The passage says, ""gambhir khatarako star ghatnuko matlab sabai dhamkiharu haraeka chan bhane chain hoina"" (meaning a decrease in the serious threat level doesn't necessarily mean all threats are gone). This implies the risk level *has* decreased, but doesn't mean risk is entirely absent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kunaini jokhim chhaina** (There is no risk) - The passage explicitly states this isn't the case.  A decreased threat level isn't the same as no threats.
* **C: Euta aakraman ko apeksha garieko chha** (An attack is expected) - The passage states there is no intelligence suggesting an imminent attack.
* **D: Guptachar le gambhir aakraman hune pushti gareko chha** (Intelligence has confirmed a serious attack is happening) -  The passage directly contradicts this, saying there's no intelligence to that effect.



"
Pradarshan sambandhi kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Rashtrapatiya aayog pradarshan ko jawaaf thiyo** (The Presidential Commission responded to the protests).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gaeko mahina rashtrapatiya ayogle deshlai naya chunawatira laijane upayako packageko rupma aghillo CEP ko rajinama sifaris gareko thiyo."" (The recent Presidential Commission, in the form of a package to bring the country to new elections, had recommended the resignation of the CEP.) This means the Presidential Commission *received* the CEP's resignation recommendation, not that it *responded* to the protests. The protests prompted the CEP to recommend resignation *to* the Presidential Commission.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Chunawa dhilo hunale pradarshan lai utprerit garyo** (The delay of elections spurred the protests) - This is accurate. The passage states, ""Kahilekanhi chunawa sampanna garna asafal bhaeka karanle hinsrak pradarshanharu suru bhae"" (Violent protests began because of the failure to hold elections).
* **C: Pradarshankari haru le yas aghiko CEP ko rajinama mag gare** (Protesters demanded the resignation of the previous CEP) - While not explicitly stated as a *demand*, the context strongly implies this. The protests happened *because* of the CEP's failures, and the CEP then recommended its own resignation, likely in response to the pressure.
* **D: Pradarshan kehi hinsrak thiyo** (The protests were somewhat violent) - The text directly states ""hinsrak pradarshanharu"" (violent protests).



"
Pachhillo CEP le rajinama dinu parne kasle sujhaae?,"The correct answer is **C: Rashtrapatiya aayog** (The Presidential Commission).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gaeko mahina rashtrapatiya ayogle deshlai naya chunawatira laijane upayako packageko rupma aghillo CEP ko rajinama sifaris gareko thiyo."" 

This directly translates to: ""The Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the CEP in the form of a package to bring the country to new elections.""

Therefore, the Presidential Commission suggested the CEP resign.

Anucched anusar USA gyamnastics nassar dwaara kheladi ko durvyavahaar pachhi ke ko samarthan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Vighatan (Obstruction/Hindrance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""USOC ko kathansanga sahamat chhaun key **wighatan bhanda baru** hamra athlete ra clubharuko hit ra tiniharuko khel sayed hamro sangha bhitra arthapurna pariwartanko sath aghi badhera ajha ramro sewa dina sakinchha."" 

This translates to: ""We agree with the USOC that **instead of obstruction** (hindrance), our athletes' and clubs' interests and their sport would be better served by meaningful change within our organization.""

The passage clearly states they are moving *away* from obstruction/hindrance – implying they were previously supporting it, or at least not actively opposing it. They now recognize that obstruction prevented progress and safety.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sashakta watawaran banaaune (Creating a empowering environment)** - The passage *supports* creating a safe and empowering environment, it doesn't say they weren't supporting it before.
*   **C: Sanstha maa aawashyak parbardhan garna (Making necessary improvements to the organization)** - Similar to B, this is something they *are* supporting now.
*   **D: Ek swatantra anusandhaan (An independent investigation)** - The passage explicitly states they *support* independent investigations.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, agadi badhda USA gymnastics ra sanyukta rajya america olympic samiti ko pramukh laxya ke ho?","The correct answer is **D: Kheladika lagi surakshit watawaran ko pravardhan garne** (Promoting a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""USA Gymnastic ra USOC ko eutai lakshya cha: kheladiharu surakshit, sakaratmak ra sashakta watawaranma khelera afno sapana sakar gurney dishatarfa aghi badhna sakun bhanera gymnastic ra any khelharu sakdo surakshit banaune."" This translates to: ""USA Gymnastics and the USOC have one goal: to move forward in a way that athletes can play in a safe, positive and empowered environment and achieve their dreams, making gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Laary Nassar ko durvyavahar maa prakash paarne** (Bringing to light Larry Nassar's abuse) - While the passage references the abuse, it's not the *primary* goal, but a situation they are addressing to achieve the overall safety goal.
*   **B: Vighatan tarfa aghi badhne** (Moving forward with obstacles) - This is mentioned as part of the process of improvement, but not the ultimate goal.
*   **C: Niji anusandhan aghi badhaune** (Conducting independent research) - Independent research is a *method* to achieve the goal of safety, not the goal itself.



"
Durghatana huda jahaz kata jadai thiyo? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Avenger class mine countermises jahaz **palawan porto princessaka** lagi yatrama gairaheko thiyo."" (Avenger class mine countermeasure ships were traveling **towards Palawan, Puerto Princesa**.)

This means the ship was heading *to* Palawan when the incident happened. The question asks where the ship was when the incident occurred, implying Palawan is the location.



"
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaeko jahaz baare ke sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo puerto princesa tira jaadai thiyo** (This sailed towards Puerto Princesa).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Avenger class mine countermises jahaz palawan porto princessaka lagi yatrama gairaheko thiyo."" (Avenger class mine countermeasure ships were traveling towards Palawan, Puerto Princesa.)  This means it was *going to* Puerto Princesa, not *was* in Puerto Princesa. Therefore, stating it sailed *to* Puerto Princesa is accurate based on the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yo palawan maa aadharit thiyo** (This was based in Palawan) - The text says it was traveling *towards* Palawan and Puerto Princesa, not based there.
* **C: Yo mine countermeasures jahaz ho** (This is a mine countermeasures ship) -  This *is* true, the text identifies it as an ""Avenger class mine countermises jahaz"" (Avenger class mine countermeasure ship). However, the question asks for what is **not** correct, and there is a more definitive incorrect statement.
* **D: Yo americi nausena ko satau fleet sanga sambandhit chha** (This is related to the US Navy's 7th Fleet) - This is also true, the text states, ""Yo americi nausenako sataun flitlai tokieko cha."" (This is assigned to the US Navy's 7th Fleet). Similar to option C, it's a correct statement, but not the answer to ""what is incorrect"".



"
Kasle americi sena sambandhi vigyapti die?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""sanyukta rajya americaka rashtrapati **donald trample**, press sachivamarfat dieka vigyaptima americi senale syria chhodera jaane ghoshana gare.""  This translates to ""The President of the United States of America, **Donald Trump**, announced the withdrawal of the American army from Syria through his press secretary."" 

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one who made the announcement regarding the American army.



"
Anuchhed anunsar kun desh le bandi ladaku lai surakshya dine jimewari liyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Turkeyle pakrau garieka ISIS ladakuharuko suraksha gurney cam pani garnechha"" which translates to ""Turkey will also provide security for ISIS fighters it has captured."" 

Therefore, Turkey is taking responsibility for the security of the captured fighters.



"
Durghatana ko kaaran ke ho bhanne anumaan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Pratikul aago (Adverse fire)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...yo shatrutapurna agoko parinamswarup bhaeko vishwas garinchha"" which translates to ""...believed to be a result of enemy fire."" This directly points to adverse fire as the cause of the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aftyaaro bhubhaag (Difficult terrain):** While difficult terrain *hinders* the search, it's not stated as the *cause* of the crash.
*   **C: Himali bhubhaag (Himalayan terrain):** Similar to A, this describes the *location* but not the *cause*.
*   **D: Kharaab mausam (Bad weather):** Bad weather is mentioned as a challenge to the search effort, but not the reason for the crash itself.



"
Durghatana kasto bhubhaag maa bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Aftyaaro** (Difficult/Challenging).

The text states: ""Durghatana hune kshetraka lagi khoji garna prayas garda **kharab mausam ra apthyaro bhu-bhag** bhetinchha."" This directly translates to ""The search for the accident site faces bad weather and **difficult terrain**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pratikul** (Adverse) - While the situation *was* adverse, the text specifically mentions the *terrain* being difficult.
*   **C: Gathbandhan** (Alliance) - This refers to the coalition, not the location.
*   **D: Himali** (Himalayan) - The text says it happened in the *high Himalayan region* but specifically points out the difficult terrain *within* that region.



"
Adhikaariharule badhi ko karan le ke hune aash garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandabar ko punarsthapana (Restoration of sandbar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the dam prevented different materials from flowing into the river, which was necessary to create sandbars and coastal areas – habitats for wildlife. Officials believe that blocking the sand will be *enough* to restore the sandbars. This directly links the officials' hope to the restoration of the sandbar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Samudri kinaar ko nirmaan (Construction of coastline):** While sandbars contribute to coastline formation, the primary focus of the officials' action is rebuilding the *sandbar* itself.
* **C: Humpback chub ko sankhyama briddhi (Increase in humpback chub population):** The passage states humpback chubs are *endangered* due to the dam. Restoring the sandbar *might* help them eventually, but it’s not the direct reason for the officials’ hope.
* **D: Jungli wanyajantu ko vasthan maa thap (Establishment of wildlife habitat):**  Again, restoring habitat is a *result* of restoring the sandbar, not the officials’ direct goal with blocking the sand.



"
Baadh ko nirman le ke laai sthai rupmaa asar garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Jungli wanyajantu ko vasthan (Habitat of wild animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the dam created habitats like sandbars and shorelines *for* wildlife. However, it also directly links the dam's construction to the loss of two fish species and endangering others (like the humpback chub). This means the dam negatively impacted the existing wildlife habitat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sandbar:** The dam *created* sandbars, it wasn’t harmed by them.
*   **B: Humpback chubs:** While they are endangered, the question asks what was *permanently* affected, and habitat loss has a broader, lasting effect than just the fate of one species.
*   **D: Padartha ko failawat (Spread of materials):** The dam *stopped* the spread of materials, it wasn't affected by it.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the dam construction permanently affected the habitat of wild animals."
Anuchhed anusar sanyukta rajya america lai kasle sambhavit aakraman baare suchana diyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Naknhulaaieko srot** (Unknown source).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""usale ek agyat srotabata jankari prapta gareko cha..."" which translates to ""he received information from an unknown source..."". This unknown source is what informed the US ambassador about the potential attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Somali atiwadi haru** - While the attacks are *planned by* Somali extremists, they didn't *inform* the US.
*   **B: Ethiopia ko aajdutavas** - The Ethiopian ambassador is not mentioned as the source of the information.
*   **D: Kenya ko euta srot** - A Kenyan source is also not specifically mentioned.



"
Tala die madhye kunle atiwadi haru ko sambhawit aakraman ko yojana laai sahi rupmaa varman garchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Dui muluk kaa pramukh sthaan harumaa bomb visfot garne** (Bombing important locations in both countries).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the information received by the US ambassador mentioned ""specially Ethiopia and Kenya's 'important locations' to be flown to by suicide bombers.""  This directly translates to a plan to bomb important locations *in both* Ethiopia and Kenya.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muluk ko pramukh sthal harumaa bomb visfot garne** (Bombing important locations in a country) - Too vague, doesn't specify which country/countries.
* **B: Dui muluk maa bomb visfot garne** (Bombing in two countries) - Doesn't specify *where* in those countries the bombing is targeted.
* **D: Euta mulukmaa bomb visfot garne** (Bombing in one country) - The text clearly states both Ethiopia and Kenya are targets.



"
Tala die madhye kun vyakti Wakil hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are explicitly mentioned as lawyers (""greeceka wakil"").
* **Petros Mantouvalos** is mentioned as a parliamentary member (""sansad sadasya"") and a lawyer (""wakil"") - so he *is* a lawyer.
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is identified as a journalist (""patrakar"").  The text doesn't state he is a lawyer.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only person listed who is not identified as a lawyer in the provided text."
Kun samuha kaa manis lai greek ko kanun samudaya maa hune ghotala maa ullekh garidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Wakil**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""Prakhyat greeceka **wakil**, Sakis Kechajioglau (Sakis Kechagioglou)..."" being arrested and convicted of bribery and corruption, triggering the scandal within the Greek legal community. While judges (Nyayadhish), journalists (Patrakar), and lawyers (Nyayadhivakta) are mentioned as being *involved* in or *affected by* the scandal, the initial trigger and the person directly implicated is the lawyer (Wakil).



"
Bharat le kati wicket gumaayo?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The text states: ""Tar kaptanko wicket gumaepachhi bharatle **7 wicket gumaera** 36 run matri banayo."" (After the captain's wicket fell, India lost **7 wickets** and made only 36 runs).



"
Anucched anusaar innings ko uccha score kati thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: 70 run**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Robin Uthappa le 11 chauka ra 2 chakka hanera matra 41 balma **70 run** banaundai inningko uchchatam anka banae."" (Robin Uthappa scored 70 runs in 41 balls with 11 fours and 2 sixes, making it the highest score of the innings.)



"
Tala die madhye kun Adam cuerden ko nirasha ko karan hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: youn samagri sambandhi site ko naya niti** (new policy regarding adult content sites).

Here's why:

The passage states that community outrage pushed for policy creation regarding sites hosting explicit material.  While this *led* to Cuerdon expressing disappointment, it wasn't the *reason* for his disappointment as stated in the first sentence.  His disappointment stemmed from Wells' actions:

*   **B: Wales ko kala hataaunu** (Wales removing art) - explicitly mentioned as a reason.
*   **C: Wales le kura nasunnu** (Wales not speaking) -  Wells pretended this was a legal reason and then said their words were a distraction.
*   **D: Kala hataune karan bare ko jhuth** (Lie about the reason for removing art) - Wells lied about the reason for removing the art.

The new policy is a *result* of the situation, not the direct cause of Cuerdon's disappointment with Wells. Therefore, it's the one that doesn't fit as a reason for his frustration.



"
Anuchhed anusar site bata ke hataieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: youn samagri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samudayako jalanle siteka lagi **youn samagrika** barema niti nirman garna halka prayasharu nimtyayo jasle lakhaun khula-ijajat prapta media host gardacha."" This translates to: ""The community's outcry led the site to lightly try to create policies regarding **explicit content** that hosted millions of openly permitted media.""

The passage clearly indicates the site was trying to address and potentially remove or regulate explicit content (""youn samagrika"").  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kala** (art) - While mentioned, it's presented as a reason for the initial issue, not what was *removed*.
*   **C: Niti ko masyauda** (policy issues) - The site *created* policies, it didn't have them removed.
*   **D: Niji swamitwo maa raheko media** (privately owned media) - This is a characteristic of the hosts, not what was taken down from the site.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye amir khan le kun kurako samarthan gardainan?,"The correct answer is **C: Mahilako vichar (Women's opinions/thoughts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said, ""malai mahilale jhagada garnu hundaina bhane lagchha. yo mero rai ho"" which translates to ""I feel women shouldn't fight. This is my opinion."" This clearly indicates he doesn't support the idea of women participating in combat sports, or at least expresses his personal belief against it.  He's not necessarily against women *in* the Olympics (A), he might be supporting a British competitor (B) later, and the passage doesn't mention his opinion on London hosting the Olympics (D).  His statement specifically challenges *mahila ko vichar* - the thought/idea of women competing in fighting.



"
Anuchhed anusar amir khan le aafno vyaktigat vichar kaa vabjud kun kura ko samarthan garne chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Mahila kheladi (Female athletes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said, ""malai mahilale jhagada garnu hundaina bhane lagchha. yo mero rai ho"" which translates to ""I don't think women should fight, that's my opinion."" This clearly expresses his support for female athletes *participating* in sports, even if he personally doesn't believe they should engage in combat sports like boxing. He's advocating for their inclusion and representation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 2004 ko olympic kaa unka saathi pratispardhi (His competitor in the 2004 Olympics):** The passage mentions his silver medal in 2004, but his opinion isn't about his competitor.
*   **C: 2012 ko olympic (The 2012 Olympics):**  The passage *mentions* the 2012 Olympics in relation to potentially helping his British competitor, but his core opinion is about female athletes in general.
*   **D: Aru rajat padak vijeta (Other silver medal winners):** The passage focuses specifically on Amir Khan and his opinion.



"
Peter Lenz ko mrityu kahile bhayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Warm-up lap ko belama**.

The passage states ""Afno warm-up lyapma hunda, lenz afno bikebata khase..."" which translates to ""During his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike..."". This directly indicates he died during the warm-up lap.
"
Xavier Zayat ko hun?,"The correct answer is **B: Arko dhawak** (Another racer).

Here's why:

The text states ""tyasapachhi racer saathi javier jayatle hane"" which translates to ""then racer companion Javier Zayat hit him."" This clearly indicates Zayat is another racer involved in the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ek on-track chikitsa karmachari** (An on-track medical personnel) - The text says medical personnel *attended* to Lenz, but doesn't say Zayat was one of them.
*   **C: Ek chikitsak** (A doctor) - Same reason as above.
*   **D: Ek prasamsak** (A commentator) - The text provides no information about Zayat being a commentator.



"
Kun awasthama ek daraeko hawaai yaatru le hawai jahaz ko bhitri jankaari faidajanak hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Yadi unko dar udan sanga asambabdhit aru kuna pidadayi ghatana ko karan le ho** (If their fear is caused by a traumatic event unrelated to flying).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically states:** ""...especially if they haven’t previously considered these things or are experiencing a traumatic event, knowing details can be helpful."" This directly links knowing about how planes work and the flight process to helping someone dealing with a *pre-existing* trauma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yadi yatru aafno darko karan le lajjit mahasus garchan** (If the traveler is embarrassed by the reason for their fear) -  Embarrassment isn't addressed in the passage.  Information about planes won't necessarily alleviate embarrassment.
* **B: Yadi hawai yatra namanparaune karan agyat ko dar ho** (If the fear of flying stems from an unknown reason) -  While a lack of knowledge *can* contribute to fear, the passage focuses on helping those already experiencing trauma.
* **C: Yadi yaatru sabai kisimko yatayat man paraudainan** (If the traveler dislikes all forms of transportation) - This is a general dislike, not a specific fear that internal knowledge of flight could address.



"
Anuchhed anusar mulya bare sachet yatri le kun kura antim maa garchan?,"The correct answer is **C: vibhinna travel company haru ko mulya tulana garne** (comparing prices of different travel companies).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that nowadays people often use airlines and travel agencies to find the cheapest airfares. It explicitly mentions that prices can *differ* between different carriers and that it's often *necessary to compare search results* and even check the airline's website directly to find the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dherai travel company ko prastav khojne** (Finding proposals from many travel companies) - While finding proposals is *part* of the process, the key is *comparing* them.
* **B: wayusewa sanga sidhai book garne** (Booking directly with the airline) -  The passage says checking the airline's website is helpful, but it doesn't say it's the ultimate step a cautious traveler takes.  Comparison is still important.
* **D: wayusewa ko website check garne** (Checking the airline's website) -  This is *one* thing a cautious traveler might do, but the primary focus is on *comparison*.



"
Anuchhed anusar yaatru harule hawai yatra ko sabai bhanda raamro mulya prapta garna sabai bhanda pahile ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: vibhinna ektrikarankarta ko mulya tulana garne** (comparing prices of different consolidators).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Kahilekaahin uhi udanma vibhinna ektrikarankartama bhinna mulya hoon sakha ra yasale khoj parinamharu tulana garna ra booking garnuaghi aafain wayusewako websitema hernka lagi pani bhuktani gardacha."" 

This translates to: ""Sometimes, the same flight can have different prices with different consolidators, and therefore, it's worthwhile to compare search results and even check the airline's website to book.""

Therefore, the passage recommends *first* comparing prices before booking.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wayusewa ko website check garne** (checking the airline's website) - The passage suggests checking the airline's website *after* comparing, not as the first step.
*   **C: wayusewa baata sidhai book garne** (booking directly from the airline) - Similar to A, this is a subsequent step, not the first.
*   **D: Travel agent sanga sidhai book garne** (booking directly with a travel agent) - The passage doesn't mention travel agents at all.



"
Kahile delivery sangai sahayatri ko awashyakta parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba saman hawai dhuwani marfat pathainchha (When goods are sent by air freight)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""airlinesko niyamle tiniharulai yatrubina shaman pathauna anumati dindaina, jahanbhitra tapain aunuhunchha."" This directly translates to ""airline regulations do not allow shipping goods without a passenger, within which you must be present."" This means a passenger (you) is *required* when shipping goods via air freight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jaba company le afnai plane ko prayog garchha (When the company uses its own plane)** - The passage mentions this as a benefit for *some* companies, but doesn't say a passenger is needed.
* **C: Jaba saman lai janch gareko saman kaa rupmaa pathainchha (When goods are sent as checked baggage)** - The passage talks about sending goods as checked baggage being the *only* fast way to deliver, but doesn't imply a passenger is required. It's simply stating a method.
* **D: Jaba delivery thulo company le samhalchha (When delivery is handled by a large company)** - The size of the company isn't related to the passenger requirement.



"
Anuchhed anusar gathabandhan maa Frequen flyer wayusewa ko chanot garda kun kura lai prathamikta dinu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aafule sabai bhahda dherai yatra garne wayusewa** (The airline you travel with most frequently).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tapainle tapainle dherai udan garnubhaeka vimaan sewama chadhna sahaj hunchha jasto lagna sakne bhae..."" (You should join the airline you fly with most often as it will be easier to accumulate points). 

This directly indicates prioritizing the airline where you have the most frequent flights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sabai bhanda dherai anka dine wayusewa** (The airline that gives the most points) - While points are good, the passage focuses on *frequency* of flying.
*   **B: Sabai bhanda thulo gathbandhan maa raheko wayusewa** (The airline with the biggest alliance) - The passage mentions being aware of different alliances but doesn't prioritize them.
*   **D: Aru suvidha thapna sakne wayusewa** (The airline that can offer other benefits) -  Benefits are mentioned, but again, frequency is the core idea.



"
Annuchhed anusar kasle dherai flyer point dina sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Eutai gathabandhan ko tapai le sabai bhanda dherai yatra garne wayusewa** (The airline service you fly most frequently within a single organization).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tapainlai tapainle dherai udan garnubhaeka vimaan sewama chadhna sahaj hunchha jasto lagna sakne bhue"" (You might find it easier to accumulate flyer points by flying with the airline you fly most often).  This directly implies frequent flying *within the same airline/organization* is the key to accumulating points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arko gathabandhan ko bhinna vayusewa** (Different airline services of another organization) - The passage warns about points potentially being stranded if you switch between different airlines.
* **C: Arko gathabandhan ko tapai le sabai bhanda dherai yatra garne wayusewa** (The airline service you fly most frequently of another organization) - Same reasoning as A.
* **D: Eutai gathabandhan ko bhinna wayusewa** (Different airline services within a single organization) - While possible, the passage emphasizes *frequency* of flying, and it's more logical that flying the *same* airline often is better than spreading your flights across various airlines within the same group.



"
Anuchhed anusar madira badhi sewan garna le kun indriya lai hani garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Herai (Eyes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Atyadhik madira seven hoon sakne sambhawit dirghakalin swasthya ghatanaharuma kalejoko kshati ra **andhopana** ra mrityusmet hoon sakha.""

""Andhopana"" translates to blindness, meaning damage to the eyes. The passage directly links excessive alcohol consumption to potential long-term health consequences including liver damage, **blindness**, and death.



"
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaye anusar madirako kaharab asar lai ke le kam garna sakne sambhavana cha?,"The correct answer is **B: Gair kanuni rupmaa utpadan garieka madira sewan gardaa** (Drinking illegally produced alcohol).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Awaidh spiritharule vibhinna khatarnak ashuddhiharu samawesh garna sakdachhan, methanol lagayat, jasle sano khurakma pani andhopan wa mrityu garauna sakdachhan."" (Illegally produced alcohol can contain various dangerous impurities, such as methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madira sanga metahnol sewan garda** (Drinking methanol with alcohol) - While methanol is dangerous, the passage focuses on it *being in* illegally produced alcohol, not specifically drinking it *with* alcohol.
* **C: Thorai thorai garera madira sewan garda** (Drinking alcohol in small amounts) - The passage warns about *any* consumption of illegally produced alcohol, regardless of amount.
* **D: vibhinna manis sanga piudaa** (Drinking with different people) - The passage doesn't mention how drinking with others affects the risks.



"
Amsterdam maa sabai bhanda badhi ghar-jagga ko mulya kaha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal jilla**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Canal district... is a famous district that surrounded Amsterdam's binnenstad and was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique cultural and historical importance, and the value of this property is the highest among all the countries.""
* **Therefore:** The Canal district has the highest property value in Amsterdam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: UNESCO ko vishwa sampada ko suchi maa bhaeko kunai sthan:** While the Canal District *is* on the UNESCO list, the passage specifically states the *Canal District* itself has the highest value, not just any UNESCO site.
* **C: Binnenstad bata tadha sthan haru:** The passage says the Canal District *surrounds* the Binnenstad, but doesn’t say those surrounding areas are the most valuable.
* **D: Aitihaasik mahatwa bhaeka stan haru:** Historical importance is a reason *why* the Canal District is valuable, but the passage directly points to the Canal District as having the highest value.



"
Canal jilla lai kina UNESCO ko vishwa sampada suchi maa raakhieko chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yasko aitihaasik ra sanskritik mahatwa ko karanle** (Because of its historical and cultural importance).

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Pura jillalai yasako adwitiya sanskritik ra aitihasik mahatwa ca lagi UNESCO vishwa sampadaka rupma tokieko cha"" (The entire district was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its unique cultural and historical importance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yaska aditiya gun harule gardaa** (Because of its unique qualities) - While true, the passage *specifically* highlights historical and cultural importance as the reason for UNESCO listing.
* **C: Yo binnenstad ko waripari bhaeko karanle** (Because it is surrounded by the binnenstad) -  Being surrounded by the inner city isn't a reason for UNESCO recognition.
* **D: Yasko uccha mulya le garda** (Because of its high value) - While it has high value, the *reason* for the value (historical and cultural significance) is what led to the UNESCO listing.



"
Anuchhed anusar ke karan le phnom krom ko bhraman sarthak hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonle sap bata dekhine drishya** (The view from Tonle Sap).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Mandirko udas watawaran ra tonal sap talko drishyale pahadma chadhnu sarthak banaunchhan."" This translates to ""Climbing the mountain with the temple's peaceful atmosphere and the view of Tonle Sap lake makes the trip worthwhile.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Angkor pass bata ko bhraman** (Traveling with the Angkor Pass) - The passage mentions needing a passport *instead* of an Angkor Pass, not that traveling with it makes the trip worthwhile.
* **C: Siem reap ko ghumai** (Touring Siem Reap) - While Siem Reap is mentioned as a possible connection point, the passage doesn’t say touring it makes the trip worthwhile.
* **D: Tala ko dunga yatra** (Boat trip on the lake) - The passage says the boat trip can be *easily combined* with the mountain climb, but doesn’t say the trip itself is worthwhile because of the boat trip.



"
Anuchhed anusar phnom krom chirda aagantuk lai ke awashyak parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Angkor pass paunu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tonele sapma jaanda angkor pass mandir praesh gurney hunale passport lyauna nabirsanu hola."" This translates to ""To go to Tonle Sap, you need an Angkor Pass to enter the temple area, you don't need to bring your passport.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yasowarman mandir bata mathi chadnu (Climbing from the Yasowarman temple):** While the passage mentions the temple, it doesn't state climbing is *required* for visitors.
* **B: Siem reap waripari ghumni (Visiting Siem Reap):** Siem Reap is mentioned as a place to combine travel, but isn't a *requirement* to visit Phnom Krom.
* **D: Tonele sap waripari dunga chadnu (Traveling by boat to Tonle Sap):**  The passage suggests a boat trip *can* be combined with the visit, but isn't necessary to visit Phnom Krom itself.



"
Anucched anusar tala die madhye ke le paryatak lai antarctica ko bhraman garna bata rokchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Simit sharirik tandurusti** (Limited physical fitness).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Paryatak bhraman mahango raheko cha, **sharirik tandurusti chahinchha**..."" which translates to ""Tourism is expensive, **physical fitness is required**..."" This directly indicates that a lack of physical fitness can prevent someone from touring Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Thulo bhraman budget** (Large travel budget) - While the passage mentions the trip is expensive, it doesn't state it *prevents* tourism.
*   **B: Ross samundra ghumne ekal ichha** (Desire to only tour the Ross Sea) - The passage doesn’t mention this as a deterrent. It states tourism is limited to the Antarctic Peninsula, islands, and Ross Sea.
*   **C: Karya talika jasle december ra january ma ghumna dinchha** (Itinerary that allows touring in December and January) - The passage discusses the warmer months (November-February) but doesn't state an itinerary limits touring.



"
Parvatarohan maa ruchi rakhne paryatak le antartica ko kun bhag ma bhraman garla?,"The correct answer is **B: Bhitri bhag (Inner region)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kahilekaahin visheshagya hawai turharu parwatarohanka lagi wa polma pugnaka lagibhitra janchhan, jasko thulo adhaar hunchha."" This directly translates to ""Sometimes specialists and air tourists go to the inner region for mountaineering, which is a major base.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ross samundra (Ross Sea):** The text mentions the Ross Sea as a limited area for travel, but not specifically for mountaineering.
*   **C: Prayadip (Peninsula):** While the text mentions the peninsula as an area for travel, it doesn't connect it to mountaineering.
*   **D: Tapu haru (Islands):** Similar to the peninsula, islands are mentioned as travel destinations, but not specifically for mountaineering.



"
Aadhunik samay agadi ko prayogshala kun sthan ma hune sambhavana chha?,"The correct answer is **D: College campus maa** (On college campus).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adhunik samayama banekobhanda pugna sajila tiniharu pry: sheher wa campusharuma awasthit thee."" This translates to ""Before the modern era, they (laboratories) were often located in cities or on campuses.""

While ""sugam sthal maa"" (easy locations) and ""sahar ko kendramaa"" (city center) are possibilities mentioned, the passage *specifically* mentions campuses alongside cities.  ""Durgam sthal maa"" (remote locations) is directly contrasted with the older labs - the passage says modern labs are now *in* remote locations, but older ones weren't.



"
Euta aadhunik anusandhan telescope kaha rakhine sambhavana hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Euta thulo sthaan maa** (A large place).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adhikatam adhunik anusandhan telescopeharu anukul watawarniya awasthaharu bhaeka durgam kshetraharuma vishal suwidha hun.""  This translates to ""Most modern research telescopes have vast facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions."" 

This indicates they need a **large space** (""vishal suwidha"") and are often in **remote areas** - implying not a museum (A), a university campus (B), or necessarily a strategic location (C). While they *might* be near a university, the passage emphasizes the need for a large and suitable environment.



"
Anuchhed anusar samudri kinar maa shanta sanga din bitauna kun kshetra sabai bhanda ramro chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Utter Harborr jilla**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uttari bank tataharu (utter harbor jillama) prashanta mahasagarma chan..."" which translates to ""Northern beaches (Utter Harbor district) are on the Pacific Ocean..."" and describes them as safe for paddling and shaded by Pohutukawa trees - ideal for a peaceful day at the beach.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: St Heliers:** The passage describes it as a busy family beach with shops, potentially crowded.
*   **B: Mission Bay:** Similar to St Heliers, it's described as a central harbor area and therefore likely busier.
*   **D: Waitemata bandargaha:** This is the name of the harbor itself, not a specific beach area.



"
Anuchhed anusar paudi khelna sabai bhanda surakshit kshetra kun hun?,"The correct answer is **B: Utter Harbor jilla**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Uttari bank tataharu (utter harbor jillama) prashanta mahasagarma chan ra uttarma long khadidekhi dakshinma davenportsamma failieka chan. Tiniharu prayaha sabai baluwa yukta samudri bankharu hun jasma **paudi khelnu surakshit cha**..."" 

This directly translates to: ""The northern beaches (in the Utter Harbor district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south. They are mostly sandy beaches **where it is safe to swim**...""

While other areas are mentioned, only Utter Harbor jilla is explicitly described as having safe swimming conditions.



"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko sthan bhraman garda kun kura lai anuchit maninchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Thatta garnu (Making fun)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""holocast wa najiharuko barema thatta nagarnuhos"" which translates to ""Do not make fun of the Holocaust or victims."" This directly addresses making fun of the sensitive subject matter as an inappropriate behavior while visiting the site.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gambhir hune abhinay garnu (Acting solemnly)** - The passage *requests* respect and seriousness, not acting.
*   **B: Site waripari kehi chinha raakhnu (Leaving some mark on the site)** - The passage doesn't mention leaving marks.
*   **D: Samrachana maa kornu (Scratching the structures)** - The passage explicitly prohibits defacing the structures (""Sanrachanaharuma bhitte chitra lagaera wa scratch garera sitelai kharab nagarnuhos"").  However, the primary and most emphasized prohibition is against mockery.



"
Yea madhye kunle boli chaalikaa bhasha janauchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Nirmit**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sahayak bhashaharu **kritrim wa sirjana garieka** bhashaharu hun..."" (Auxiliary languages are **artificial or created** languages...)
* **Nirmit** directly translates to ""created"" or ""constructed"" in Nepali.
* **Kutrim** means ""artificial"" but doesn't fully capture the idea of deliberate *creation*.
* **Aprakritik** means ""unnatural"" which is true, but doesn't focus on the *origin* of the language.
* **Prakritik** means ""natural"" - the opposite of what the passage describes.

Therefore, **Nirmit** is the closest and most accurate translation of ""created"" as used in the context of the passage describing auxiliary/artificial languages.



"
Yea madhye kun wakyale sahayak bhashalai sahi rupma janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Yea bhasha prakritik ra nirmit dubai hun** (This language is both natural and artificial).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sahayak bhashaharu kritrim wa sirjana garieka bhashaharu hun"" (Auxiliary languages are artificial or created languages). This directly contradicts the claim that they are *natural* languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says auxiliary languages facilitate communication *when* understanding between natural languages is difficult, not that they help people who don't understand each other at all.
* **C:** This aligns with the passage's statement about auxiliary languages being created to overcome communication difficulties. However, it's not the statement that *incorrectly* identifies them.
* **D:** This describes the *purpose* of creation (for speakers of different languages) but doesn't misidentify the nature of the language itself.



Therefore, option B is the only one that makes a false claim about auxiliary languages according to the provided text."
Anucched anusar jaado maa samundri yaatra garda yatru le ke janch garnu parcha?,"Correct answer is **B: Bhisa ko awashyakta**.

The text explicitly states: ""kruj yatriharulai bhisa awashyakataharubata (sartaharulai jaanchnuhos) chhuta diieko cha."" which translates to ""Kruj passengers have been exempted from visa requirements (check the conditions)."" This means checking visa requirements is something a traveler needs to do when going on a sea voyage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabin ko sthan** - While the text mentions ""cabinko sthan jaanch garnuhos"", it's in the context of a scary noise and not a requirement for travel.
*   **C: Shart haru** - The text mentions ""sartaharulai jaanchnuhos"" (check the conditions), but the primary thing the yatri (traveler) needs to check is the *bhisa awashyakta* (visa requirements). The conditions are related to the visa exemption.
*   **D: Sahar maa bitaune avadhi** - The text mentions ""saharma samay samawesh gare"" (spent time in the city), but this isn't something a traveler *needs to check* before a journey.



"
Anuchhed anusar samudri yatra garmi maa bhae yatru le ke bata joginu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhisa ko awashyakta (Visa requirements)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""kruj yatriharulai bhisa awashyakataharubata (sartaharulai jaanchnuhos) chhuta diieko cha."" which translates to ""Kruj travelers have been exempted from visa requirements (check the conditions).""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions travelers needing to check visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sahar maa bitaune samay (Time spent in the city)** - The text mentions cities (Saint Petersburg, Pietersberg) but doesn't say travelers need anything related to the time spent there.
*   **B: Hiun ko yatra (Hiun's journey)** - Hiun is mentioned as something scary, but not as a requirement for travel.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg** - While Saint Petersburg is named, it's not a requirement for the journey itself.



"
Barcelona maa sanket ra ghosana ko lagi kina praya catalan ko prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo sahar ko pahilo adhikarik bhasa thiyo (Yo is the city's first official language)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jahansamma, dherai sanket haru kewal catalanma matra sanket garinchhan kinky yo kanundwara pahilo adhikarik bhashaka rupma sthapit cha."" This directly translates to: ""However, many signs are only signaled in Catalan because it was established as the first official language by law.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yaslai spanish bhanda dheraile bhujhchhan (They understand it more than Spanish):** While the passage mentions most people understand Catalan and also speak Spanish, it doesn't state that it's *more* understood than Spanish.
*   **C: Yo barcelona maa ruchaine bhasa ho (It's a language liked in Barcelona):** The passage focuses on the *official* status of the language, not general preference.
*   **D: Metro ra aru sarvajanik sthan ghumna aaune nagarik le praaya catalan bolchhan (Citizens visiting the metro and other public places prefer to speak Catalan):** The passage doesn't mention visitor preference, but rather the official language used for signage and announcements.



"
Yea madhye barcelona ko metro pranali le niyamit ghosana ko laagi kun bhasa ko prayog garchhan?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metroma niyamit ghoshana catalanma matra garinchha..."" This directly translates to ""The metro regularly makes announcements *only* in Catalan."" While other languages are used for automated announcements about disruptions, the regular announcements are exclusively in Catalan.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun suvidhaa laai uccha mulya ko ochhyan ra breakfast le prathamikta maa rakhdaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Tej gatiko wifi**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses heavily on the ambiance, setting, and quality of the breakfast/brunch experience. It describes things like comfortable seating, seasonal food, and a historical building. It prioritizes *ochhyan* (ambiance) and *bihanko khaja* (breakfast/brunch).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vishista menu item haru (Special menu items):** The passage explicitly mentions ""swadishta khanekura wa hostle tayar parney vishesh khana"" - delicious food or specially prepared dishes.
* **B: Vishista prachin saman haru (Special antique items):** The passage mentions a ""prachin shaman"" (ancient setting) and a ""aitihasik purano bhawan"" (historical old building), indicating the importance of antique elements.
* **C: Ramro sanga rakhieko bahiri kshetra (Well-maintained outdoor area):** The passage refers to a ""herwichar garieko maidan"" (thoughtfully arranged field), emphasizing a pleasant outdoor space.

**Tej gatiko wifi (Fast-speed wifi)** is not mentioned *at all* in the passage.  The focus is entirely on the sensory and historical experience, not on modern conveniences like wifi. Therefore, it's the one facility the passage doesn't prioritize alongside ambiance and breakfast.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun luxury B&Bs ko lagi pratispardha ko vishay hoinan?,"The correct answer is **A: Aadhunik sajawat (Modern decoration)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the competition between ""ochhyan"" (ambiance/setting) and ""bihanko khaja"" (breakfast) as the main factors differentiating excellent B&Bs. It specifically mentions:

* **Ochhyan:**  refers to a traditional setting - ancient shaman, well-maintained grounds, old buildings.
* **Bihanko khaja:** refers to seasonal, specially prepared breakfast.
* **Uccha mulya ko ochhyan (High-priced ambiance):** is directly mentioned as a competition point.
* **Sthaniya khana ra peya padartha (Local food and beverages):** is part of the breakfast offerings.
* **Seasonal breakfast ko laamo suvidhaa (Long facilities for seasonal breakfast)** is also mentioned.

Modern decoration isn’t mentioned as a factor of competition in the passage. The passage emphasizes *traditional* and *historical* settings. Therefore, modern decoration would not be a competing factor within the context of the provided text.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun 2022 maa beijing maa hune chhaina?","The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng ski kshetra karyakram**.

Here's why:

The passage states that skiing competitions will be held *at* the Taijicheng ski area, which is **220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing**. It doesn't say the events will be *in* Beijing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Udghatan samaroha (Opening ceremony)** - The passage explicitly states Beijing will host the opening ceremony.
*   **C: Samapan samaroha (Closing ceremony)** - The passage explicitly states Beijing will host the closing ceremony.
*   **D: Bhitra kheline hiunkaa karyakramharu (Indoor ice programs)** - The passage says Beijing will host indoor ice programs.

Therefore, the only event listed that won't actually be *in* Beijing is the skiing competitions at Taijicheng.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun 2022 maa beijing le aayojana garnechha?,"The correct answer is **C: Shitakaalin olympics**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""P: Sun 2022 maa hune **shitkalin olympic khelko ayojak sahar chinko beijing sahar hune cha.**"" (P: The city hosting the **winter olympic games** in 2022 will be Beijing, China.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Grishmakaalin olympics** - The text specifies *winter* olympics, not summer.
*   **B: Bhitra hune hiunkaa karyakramharu** - (Indoor ice programs) - While Beijing *is* hosting these, it's not the main event being organized.
*   **D: Samapan samaroha** - (Closing ceremony) - This is *part* of the Olympics, but not the entire event Beijing is organizing.



"
Avian influenza ko sankraman hune sambavana sabai bhanda badhi kaslai hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kukhura paalan maa kaam garne vyaktiharu** (People working in poultry farming).

**Explanation:**

The passage specifically states: ""Jyan gumaune mancheharumadhye dheraijaso kukhura palanma cam gurney wyaktiharu raheka chan..."" (Among those who fell ill, many were people involved in chicken farming...). This directly indicates that people working in poultry farming have the highest risk of infection.

Here's why the other options are less likely based on the passage:

* **A: Chara ko awalokan garne harulaai** (People observing birds): While the passage mentions observing birds carries some risk, it's not the highest risk group identified.
* **B: Mamsahari jiv sanga kaam garne haaru laai** (People working with carnivorous animals): The passage doesn't mention any connection to carnivorous animals.
* **D: Pahila sankramit bhaekaa haru** (First infected people): This describes *who* got sick, not *who is most likely* to get sick.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun wakya le bird flue lai sahi rupmaa janauchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Chara ko awalokan garne haru maa sankraman ko jokhim hunchha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...timadhye kehi ghatak chan. Jyan gumaune mancheharumadhye dheraijaso kukhura palanma cam gurney wyaktiharu raheka chan tar charaharu awalokan garna chahane wyaktima pani yasabata kehi jokhim raheko cha.""  This directly translates to: ""...there are some factors. Among the people who have died, many are people involved in poultry farming, but people who want to observe animals are also at some risk from this.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukhura palan maa kaam garne vyakti haru jaslai pahila flu le sankraman garyo** - While the passage mentions poultry workers being *among* those infected, it doesn't say they were the *first* to be infected.
* **B: Manis bhanda chara maa badhi sankraman dekhieko chha** - The passage states the virus can infect both birds and other animals, and that there have been many human cases, but doesn’t compare infection rates between animals and humans.
* **D: Manis maa dekhieko sabai sankraman ghatak hunchha** - The passage only says there *are* factors, not that *all* infections are fatal.



"
White Sea-Baltic canal le ke jodchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic mahasagar ra baltic samudra**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""White C-Baltic Canelle dheraijaso nadi ra talharudwara onega tall, ladoga tall ra cent pietersbergmarfat arctic mahasagarlai baltic sisanga jodchha."" This translates to: ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal, through many rivers and lakes, connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga, and Saint Petersburg.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Black samudra ra Caspian samudra** - The text mentions Bhaikingharule (Vikings) using routes connecting these seas, but doesn't state the White Sea-Baltic canal does.
*   **B: Onega taal ra volga nadi** - While Lake Onega is mentioned as part of the canal's route, the Volga isn't directly linked in the description.
*   **D: Dakshini mahasagar ra red sea** - These seas aren't mentioned in the provided text.



"
Anuchhed anusar kasto kisim ko gadi maa rahadaani sankalan garnu parchaa taki yatru lai avarodh nahos?,"The correct answer is **B: Raatri sleeper rail**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Rati sutne railharuma, conductorle rahadaniharu sankalan garna sakdachhan taaki tapainlai nindrama badha napugos."" This translates to ""In night sleeper trains, conductors can arrange beds so that you are not disturbed while sleeping.""  This directly refers to needing to arrange beds on night sleeper trains to avoid disturbing passengers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vimaan (airplane):** The passage mentions airplanes only as an example of a mode of transport at the beginning but doesn't discuss bed arrangements on them.
*   **C: jahaz (ship):** Similar to airplanes, ships are just mentioned as modes of transport.
*   **D: Sima pariko rail (border rail):** The passage mentions border rails for inspection, but doesn't relate it to needing bed arrangements.



"
Anuchhed anusar kunai sima pariko rail maa tapai ko id kun bela janch garine chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Rail bata utre pachhi** (After getting off the train).

Here's why:

The passage states that checks are done on trains *crossing borders*. It also says the conductor and security personnel will collect information *while you are sleeping* to avoid disturbing you. This implies your ID will be checked **after** you disembark the train at the checkpoint.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sutiraheko samaya maa** (While sleeping) - While they collect information then, it doesn't explicitly say your ID is *checked* during that time.
* **C: Yasko janch hudaina** (This is not checked) - The passage clearly states there *is* a check.
* **D: Kudiraheko rail maa** (While on the train) - The passage implies the check happens *after* getting off the train to avoid disturbance.



"
Yea madhye singapore ko uccha ushna pradeshiya kshetra maa rahada kun vishay uthne sambhavana huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Dherai garmi le thakne (Getting tired due to the heat)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that Singapore is in a ""high heat zone"" and you need to ""prepare to face heat (daytime) and humidity (clear skies, evening)."" This directly implies that the risk of getting tired from the heat is high.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lootpaat garne (Being robbed):** The passage mentions Singapore is generally safe.
*   **B: Dokan maa pahunch nahune (Not being able to reach shops):** The passage says it's easy to navigate and you can easily buy things.
*   **D: Bato biraune (Getting lost):** The passage states it's easy to navigate.



"
Kasla german pastries nakhanu thik hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Jaslai masaledar bhanda mitho swad man parchha** (Those who prefer sweet over savory flavors).

Here's why:

The passage describes German pastries as being sweet, often fruit-filled (cherry, plum), and made with nuts (almond, hazelnut). It specifically mentions they are paired with coffee and milk. This all points to a preference for sweet flavors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jaslai badam ko gambhir allergy chha** (Those with a severe almond allergy) - The passage *mentions* almonds are commonly used, making it a bad choice for someone with an allergy.
*   **B: Jaslai ali bahdi desert man parchha** (Those who like very heavy desserts) - The passage doesn't necessarily indicate the pastries are particularly ""heavy"".
*   **C: Jaslai chocolate man pardaina** (Those who don't like chocolate) - Chocolate isn't specifically mentioned in the description of German pastries.



"
yea madhye kun german pastries ko lagi seasonal tatwa maninchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aalubakhada (Plums)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...garmiyamma cherry ra **alubkhada pani prayog garinchha**."" This translates to ""...cherries and **plums are also used** in summer."" This indicates that plums are a seasonal ingredient used in German pastries during the summer months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Syaau (Apples):** While apples might be used in German pastries, the text doesn't mention them as a *seasonal* ingredient.
*   **B: Hazelnuts:** The text mentions hazelnuts as an ingredient often *included* in pastries, but not specifically tied to a season.
*   **D: Badaam (Almonds):** Similar to hazelnuts, almonds are mentioned as an ingredient, not a seasonal one.



"
Anuchhed anusar budget maa bhraman garda kun kura ko sifaris garidaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Manisharu sanga paisa magnu** (Begging people for money).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that low-budget travelers *do not* exploit or take advantage of others for their own benefit, and it mentions not begging or soliciting money from people.  The passage emphasizes ethical low-budget travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhraman ko bela sana tina kam garnu** (Taking less time for travel) - The passage mentions sacrificing time for a minimal budget.
* **B: Aafno sahajta ko star maa lachilo banu** (Being flexible with your comfort level) - This aligns with the idea of choosing travel options based on necessity, lifestyle, and challenges.
* **D: Khana ra awas ko kharcha maa katauti garnu** (Cutting costs on food and accommodation) - This is a typical strategy for budget travel and is implied in the passage.



"
Anuchhed anusar sano budget maa bhraman garda kaslai garo parna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaslai samayko pabandi chhaina** (Those who don't mind being flexible with time).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...samay ra purvanuman tyagna chahaneharule nyunatam budget yatra hernuhos"" which translates to ""...those who are willing to sacrifice time and predictability have the lowest budget travel."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jasle chunauti ko swagat garchha** (Those who welcome challenges): While low-budget travel *can* be challenging, the passage specifically emphasizes sacrificing time and planning.
* **C: Jasle bhraman ko belaa tadha bata kam garne yojana banaeko chha** (Those who have a plan to work while traveling): The passage doesn't mention anything about working while traveling.
* **D: Jasle talika anusar kam garna ramailo manchha** (Those who enjoy working according to a schedule): This is the opposite of what the passage suggests - low-budget travel requires flexibility, not sticking to a schedule.



"
Tala madhye kun vakya le point marion ra fairmont bich ko drive lai sahi ruple janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Mobile sewa maa kunai samasya aaudaina**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yadyapi, yo margama raheka pensylvania wilds jasta any sthanko tulanama yahan mobile phone sewa nikai ramro cha."" (However, mobile phone service is relatively good here compared to other places in the Pennsylvania wilds.) This directly contradicts the idea of *no* problems with mobile service.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Tyaha dherai lama durgam bata haru chhan.** (There are many long, difficult hills.) - The passage explicitly mentions ""durgam jungli bhubhag"" (difficult jungle areas) and ""thado shreni"" (steep grades).
* **B: Lane haru sanghuro chhan.** (The lanes are narrow.) - The passage mentions ""sanghuro marg"" (narrow roads).
* **C: Gati ko simako palana garidaina.** (Speed limits should not be followed.) - The passage emphasizes the importance of obeying speed limits (""kada agyapalan anyathabhanda ajha mahatwapurna hunchha"") which are typically 35-40 mph.



"

This translates to: ""If you are not used to driving on country roads, be cautious as steep grades, winding roads, and sharp curves are prevalent.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhari sawari chap maa fasne** (Getting stuck in heavy traffic) - The passage doesn't mention heavy traffic.
* **B: Mobile ko sewa ko kami** (Lack of mobile service) - The passage *specifically* says mobile service is *good* on this road compared to other areas of Pennsylvania wilds.
* **D: Bato maa hune sadak nriman karyaharuh ko samana dherai garnu** (Dealing with many road construction workers) -  The passage doesn't mention road construction.



"
Canyoneering suru garda yea madhye kunko aawashyakta pardaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Charam shaaririk awashtha (Extreme physical condition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoning *requires* some training and physical fitness (compared to activities like rock climbing, scuba diving, etc.), but it doesn't say it requires an *extreme* physical condition.  It mentions skills like walking, flying (rappelling), and jumping, and implies training builds those skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Paudine kshamata (Ability to walk):** Canyoning definitely involves walking.
* **C: Ufrane kshamata (Ability to fly/rappel):** The passage specifically mentions ""udne"" (flying/rappelling) as a component.
* **D: Thorai matramaa prashikshan (Some training):**  The passage explicitly states ""tulanatmak rupma sano prashikshan"" (some training).



"
Ek safal canyoning bhraman kaa lagi tala madhye ke aawashyak parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Paudane kshamata (Ability to swim)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states canyoning involves going down waterfalls (""panile bharieko jharanako tall jaane ho"").** This directly implies a need to be able to swim.
* While athleticism (A) is helpful, it's described as relative (""tulnatmak rupma sano"") and not absolutely necessary. The passage says training and physical fitness are *comparable* to activities like rock climbing, not that you need the same level of ability.
* Scuba diving experience (B) is irrelevant to canyoning, which is done in flowing water, not underwater.
* A canyoning certification (C) might be helpful or required for certain tours, but the *fundamental* requirement for *any* canyoning trip is the ability to swim.

Therefore, the most essential thing for a successful canyoning trip, based on the passage, is the ability to swim.



"
Anuchhed anusar aafnai car maa sutne yojana banauda kun kura aawashyak parcha?,"The correct answer is **A: Aafno gaadi ko sima bare darho bujhaai** (Understanding the limitations of your car).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Thulla sawariharuko viparit, tapain shayed phile nai afno car chalauna parichit hunuhunchha ra yasako simitta tapainlai thaha cha."" (Unlike large vehicles, you may already be familiar with driving your car and *you know its limitations*).  This directly implies you need to know what your car can handle before planning to sleep in it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Seat muni sarna milne gadi** (A car with seats that flatten) - While helpful, the passage doesn't *require* this. It suggests car camping is possible *with* certain vehicles, implying you can make it work even without fully flat seats.
* **C: Tent** (Tent) - The passage specifically distinguishes sleeping in your car from ""camping"" which implies needing a tent.
* **D: Camp banauna niji jaga** (Private land to set up camp) - The passage focuses on sleeping *in* your car, not setting up a campsite.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yadi radar maa rahane ho bhane car maa camper haru le kun kura bata joginu parchha?","The correct answer is **A: Thulo gadi chalaunu, jastai suv athawa minivan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadi tapainsanga thulo minibhyan, SUV, sedan wa station vegan cha jasko sitharu dhalkinchan bhane car camping sambhawa hunchha.""  This translates to: ""If you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with seats that recline, car camping is possible.""

The question asks what campers need if they are staying in a car. The passage directly answers that a larger vehicle (like an SUV or minivan) is needed for car camping to be feasible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lamo yatra garnu (Going on a long journey)** - While the passage mentions long journeys, it doesn't say that's *required* for car camping.
*   **C: Sahar maa wa niji jagama tent lagaunu (Setting up a tent in the city or on private land)** - The passage explicitly contrasts car camping with traditional camping (which involves tents).
*   **D: Aafule prayog gareko ga\\adi sanga parichit nahunu (Not being familiar with the vehicle you are using)** - The passage says you *should* be familiar with your car.



"
Anuchhed anusar dosro patak casablanca kasle punanirman gare?,"The correct answer is **D: Morakko kaa sultan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Morakkoko sultanle shaharlai daarah ell badayako rupma punarnirman gare ra yasalai tyahan wyaparik adharharu banaune spenka wyapariharule casablancako name die."" This translates to: ""The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and the Spanish merchants gave Casablanca its name to make it a commercial base.""

Therefore, the Moroccan sultan is the one who rebuilt Casablanca after the 1755 earthquake.



"
Prakritik prakop pachhi kasle casablanca ko aadhunik sahar lai chhode?,"The correct answer is **B: Portuguese**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Portugaliharule yasalai nashta gare ra kewal sun 1755 maa gaeko bhukampapachi harauna nadin casa bransako name antargat yasako punarnirman gare."" (The Portuguese destroyed it and only after the earthquake in 1755 did they rebuild it under the name Casa Branca).

This clearly indicates the Portuguese were responsible for the destruction that preceded the modern city's rebuilding.



"
Anuchhed anusar sintra le videshiharu sanga kasari pahichan banae?,"The correct answer is **C: Lord Byron kaa sakaratmak samiksha haru**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jaslai lord bairandwara record garieko ra yasaka shanko chamakdar ghatanapachi videshiharuka lagi prasidha banaieko thiyo."" This translates to ""...which Lord Byron recorded and made famous for foreigners with the magnificent events of its hills.""

Therefore, Sintra gained recognition among foreigners through Lord Byron's positive reviews and documentation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca:** While mentioned as a stop on a bus route, it doesn't explain *how* Sintra became known to foreigners.
*   **B: Marian kaa pisach haru:** This refers to a pilgrimage site (""Lady of Fatima's great sanctuary"") but isn't about Sintra's initial fame with foreigners.
*   **D: Yo romantic itihas ho:** This is a general statement about Sintra's character, not how it became *recognized* by foreigners.

Charlotte maa taxi lida kun karan le thap shulka parna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Tin yatru hudaa** (Having three or more passengers).

Here's why:

The text states: ""2bhanda badhi yatru hunale adhibhar lagnale yo vikalpa awashyakbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakha."" This translates to ""If there are more than 2 passengers, this option can be more expensive than necessary.""  This directly implies that a higher fare applies when there are three or more passengers, essentially a surcharge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Arko kshetra maa basdaa** (Living in another area) - The text doesn't mention fares being affected by where passengers live.
*   **C: Sahar ko mathillo bhag jada** (Upper part of the city) - The text mentions Uptown Charlotte being family-friendly but doesn't link fares to location within the city.
*   **D: Pariwarik maitri hudaa** (Being family-friendly) -  The text says Charlotte is family-friendly, but that doesn't affect taxi fares.



"
Anuchhed anusaar charlotte maa balbalika sanga basda huna sakne befaida ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Taxi ko yatra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kehi paristhitiharuma prayog garna taxiharu samanyataya charlotma pariwarharule prayog gardainan. 2bhanda badhi yatru hunale adhibhar lagnale yo vikalpa awashyakbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakha."" (In some situations, families in Charlotte generally don't use taxis. If there are more than 2 passengers, this option can be more expensive than necessary.)

This directly indicates that using taxis is a disadvantage when traveling with children in Charlotte due to cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gharko mulya (House price):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of housing being a disadvantage.
*   **C: Aru kshetra kaa basinda (Residents of other areas):** The passage states that people *choose* Charlotte because of family friendliness, not that being from another area is a disadvantage.
*   **D: Sahar maa ramauna khojda (Finding fun in the city):** The passage highlights that Charlotte is easy to enjoy with children, making this option incorrect.



"
Spanish ko aagaman chile ko uttari bhag maa kasko niyantran thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Araucanians**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""16th century maa spenishharu prasthan garnuaghi uttari chilima adivasi araukanian (mapuche) basne garthe."" This directly translates to: ""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the northern part of Chile was inhabited by indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche).""

While Mapuche is another name for Araucanians, Araucanian is the term used specifically in the context of Spanish arrival and control in the passage.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche:** While correct that Mapuche people lived there, 'Araucanian' is the term used in the passage to describe who had control *before* the Spanish arrived.
*   **B: Americi:** This is too broad - it refers to the continents, not a specific group controlling the region.
*   **D: Incas:** The Incas ruled areas further north, and the passage states the Araucanians were in northern Chile *before* the Spanish, implying they weren't under Inca rule at that time.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun ghatana 1810 maa ghateko hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: Chile le spanish mathi vijay prapta garyo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Chile declared its independence in 1810, but Spain didn't achieve a decisive victory until 1818. This means Chile didn't *win* against the Spanish in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: Tyaha kendriya sarkarko anupasthiti thiyo** - The passage mentions Spain's central government was weakened and unable to fully control Chile due to the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **C: Napoleonic yuddha haru jaari thie** - The passage directly states the declaration of independence occurred *during* the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **D: Chile le swatantra bhaeko ghosana garyo** - The passage clearly states Chile declared its independence in 1810.



"
Ligugria kshetra maa manis durgam kshetra maa kasari pugna sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **B: Car wa rail bata**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""path, rail ra dungale gaaunharu joddachha ra karharule tiniharulai bahirbata puryauna sakdainan."" This translates to ""paths, trains and boats connect the villages and cars cannot reach them from outside.""  This directly implies you can reach the villages by car *and* train. While boats connect them, the text highlights the difficulty cars have in reaching them *from the outside*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Car wa dunga bata** - Cars can't reach from outside.
*   **C: Rail wa dunga bata** - While true you can use rail and boat, the text explicitly mentions car as a way to reach.
*   **D: Plane wa rail bata** - The text doesn't mention planes.



"
Italian abhivyakti ‘cinque terre’ le ke janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanch gaau** (Five villages).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Liguriako italy kshetrama awasthit panchwata sano samudri tatawarti gaaunharu rheomaggior, manarola, cornigla, bhernaja ra monterosso samawesh gurney sinke tere, jasko earth paanch jagga ho."" This translates to ""The Cinque Terre, located in the Liguria region of Italy, includes five small villages on the sea coast: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.""  ""Cinque Terre"" literally means ""Five Lands"" or ""Five Villages"" in Italian.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Paanch bato haru** (Five roads) - The text mentions paths, but doesn't define Cinque Terre as five roads.
*   **C: Paanch bhir haru** (Five cliffs) - While the villages are on cliffs, Cinque Terre doesn't mean ""five cliffs.""
*   **D: Paanch samundra** (Five seas) - The villages are *by* the sea, but Cinque Terre doesn't mean ""five seas.""



"
"Anuchhed anusar, jado maa chiplana bata jogina kasto jutta upayukta hunchha?","The correct answer is **B: Stud jadit jutta (Studded shoes)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*tyahan chipline awasthaka lagi, dheraijaso jutta ra butka lagi suhaundo, hill wa hill ra taluwaka lagi stud garieko sahayogi upkaran hunchhan.*"" This translates to ""...there, shoes and boots are useful for slippery conditions, with studs on the heels and soles as supportive equipment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Saanghuro taluwa bhaeko jutta (Shoes with rough soles):** While rough soles are helpful, the passage *specifically* mentions studs.
*   **C: Aglo taluwa bhaeko jutta (Smooth-soled shoes):**  Smooth soles would be *less* helpful on slippery surfaces.
*   **D: 1/5 inch gahiro dhacha nabhaeko jutta (Shoes without a 1/5 inch deep tread):** The passage mentions tread depth as important, but *studs* are the key feature for ice/slippery conditions.



"
Jado ko bela hiun bhaeko batomaa traction sudhar garna yea madhye kasle sahayog gardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: pani (water)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that *baluwa (sand), gitty wa lawan (calcium chloride)* are used to improve traction on roads and paths. It also mentions that ice and snow *reduce* traction, and some winter boots have studs to *counteract* slipperiness.  Water, especially when freezing into ice, *decreases* traction, it doesn't improve it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Noon (Salt)** - *Lawan* (calcium chloride) is a type of salt and is mentioned as helping traction.
*   **B: Roda (Gravel/Gitty)** - *Gitty* is explicitly mentioned as a traction enhancer.
*   **C: Baaluwa (Sand)** - *Baaluwa* is explicitly mentioned as a traction enhancer.



"
Yea madhye hawaii ra cook tapu bich ko sahi samanta ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Dubai le rajya ko manyata paeka chhainan**.

Here's why:

The passage contrasts the Cook Islands with Hawaii. It states the Cook Islands *doesn't* have the infrastructure (large hotels, development) to attract the same number of tourists as Hawaii, and is sometimes mistaken for Hawaii by older visitors. This implies Hawaii *is* well-developed and recognized.  

Option B parallels this idea - Dubai, like Hawaii, is a well-known place, but the passage is focused on the Cook Islands *not* having statehood/recognition. The passage is highlighting the Cook Islands' lack of statehood compared to places like Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dubai maa thula hotel chhan** - The passage doesn't mention Dubai at all.
* **C: Dubai ko time zone eutai ho** - The passage mentions time zones in relation to Hawaii, but not Dubai.
* **D: Dubai maa sahar chhainan** - Dubai is known for its cities.



"
Yea madhye kunle cook tapu haruko sahi vardan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yo hawai bhanda sano chha** (This is smaller than Hawaii).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sano bhae tapani, yasale sabai thulla paryatak hotel ra any vikas bina rajyako sangya paunubhanda phile hawaika kehi budha agantukharuko samjhana garaunchha."" This translates to ""Smaller islands, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii because it doesn't have all the large tourist hotels and development.""  This directly compares Cook Islands to Hawaii and highlights its smaller size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yo tapuharuko samuha ho** (This is a group of islands) - The passage clearly states it's a group of 15 islands. This isn't a *vardan* (blessing/positive attribute) specifically of the Cook Islands, just a factual description.
* **C: Yaska pramukh sahar rarotonga ra aitutaki hun** (Its main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki) - This is a statement *about* the Cook Islands, not a blessing *of* the Cook Islands.
* **D: Yas tapu muluk ra hawaii ko eutai time zone ho** (This island country and Hawaii are in the same time zone) - The passage states they are in the same time zone, but again, this is a fact, not a blessing.



"
Yea madhye kun ranger station le dui prakar ko awas ko vikalpa dinchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena ekmatra ranger station ho jasle chhatraas basobas ra camping bahek ramro bhojan pradan gardacha.""  This translates to ""Sirena is the only ranger station that provides lodging and camping besides good food."" This means Sirena offers both lodging (chhatraas basobas) and camping, representing two types of accommodation.

The other options only offer camping:

*   **Los Patos:** khana sewa bina camping matra (camping only without food service)
*   **La Leona:** khana sewa bina camping matra (camping only without food service)
*   **San Pedrillo:** khana sewa bina camping matra (camping only without food service)



"
Anuchhed anusar yadi credit ko satta nagad chahida kaha park ko anumati reserve garna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Puerto jimnejko ranger stationbatai park anumatiharu surakshit garna sakinchha tar tiniharule credit card swikar gardainan"" which translates to ""Park permits can be secured from the Puerto Jiménez ranger station, but they do not accept credit cards."" 

Since the question asks where to reserve a park permit *if you don't have a credit card*, Puerto Jiménez is the only option mentioned that doesn't require one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Sirena:** Only accepts reservations with credit cards.
*   **CafeNet El Sol:** Offers reservations *using* credit cards.
*   **La Leona:** Only offers camping without food service."
Anuchhed anusar thado bhubhag maa kun prakar ko skiing garinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Backcountry skiing**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Schemarfat backpacking: yo gatiwidhilai backcontry sky..."" (Schemarfat backpacking: this activity involves backcountry skiing...) and then describes it as happening in ""pachhiltira thado kshetrama"" (remote snowy areas).  The description goes on to detail the type of skiing involved - essentially hiking with skis, needing ski and boots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sky hiking:** While sky hiking is *part* of the description, the overall activity is defined as backcountry skiing.
*   **C: Alpine shaili:** The passage states backcountry skiing doesn't *necessarily* include alpine-style skiing.
*   **D: sky dwara backpacking:** This is too broad. Backpacking *with* skis is happening, but the specific activity is backcountry skiing.



"
Anuchhed anusar uccha gati maa pugna backcountry skier lai ke le sahayog garna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ramro awastha (Good condition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ramra awasthaharuma tapain hindnubhanda kehi adhik duree paar garna saksham hunuhunechha"" which translates to ""In good condition, you will be able to cover some distance beyond your limits.""  This directly indicates that being in good physical condition helps a backcountry skier achieve higher speeds and go further.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kada jutta (Ski boots):** While essential, boots don't *help you go faster*, they're fundamental equipment.
* **B: Bhari backpack (Heavy backpack):** The passage explicitly states you need to avoid a *heavy* backpack to achieve cross-country skiing speed.
* **D: Herchaha garieko bato (Prepared path):** The passage describes backcountry skiing as similar to hiking – implying it's *not* on prepared paths, but rather navigating challenging terrain.



"
Puna pravesh garda asahaj mahasush garne yatri lai ke garda kathin hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ghar ko sanskriti maa puna ghulmil huna (Re-integrating into one's home culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Videshma base pachhi ghar farkanda tapain naya sanskritima milnu hune ra tapainko gharko sanskritibata kehi baniharu haraune cha. ... uniharuko mull sanskritima punah ghulmil garna gahro hunchha.""  This translates to: ""After living abroad and returning home, you will adapt to the new culture and lose some things from your home culture. ... It is difficult for them to re-integrate into their original culture.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naya thau ko sanskriti maa ghulmil huna (Adapting to a new culture):** The passage says adapting to the *new* culture (while abroad) is *easier*. The difficulty lies in returning *home*.
* **B: Dhairya ra samajhdar banna (Being patient and understanding):** While patience and understanding are helpful, the passage specifically highlights the challenge of cultural re-integration, not just needing those qualities.
* **C: Videsh bhraman garna (Traveling abroad):** This is the *cause* of the issue, not the difficult part itself.



"
Anuchhed anusar puna pravesh garda mahasus hune asahajta kasto yatri kaa lagi badhi kathin huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tyasta yatri haru jaslai nikai naramrari sanskritik aaghat anubhav huncha (Those travelers who experience a very severe cultural shock)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Punah praesh aghat sanskriti aghatbhanda chaando aundachha (hanimun charan come cha), lamo samayasamma rahanchha, ra badhi gambhir hunasakchha."" This translates to ""Re-entry shock is more difficult than culture shock, it lasts a long time, and can be very serious."" It further explains that it's harder for those trying to reintegrate into their original culture.

The passage implies the difficulty is *increased* by the severity of the cultural shock experienced while abroad.  The more profound the impact of being in a different culture, the harder it is to readjust.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tyasta yatri jo videsh maa chadai samayojan hunchhan (Those travelers who quickly adjust abroad):**  The passage says reintegration is *harder* for those coming back, it doesn't suggest quick adjustment abroad makes it harder.
* **C: Tyasta yatri jo ajhai honeymoon ko charan maa chhan (Those travelers still in the honeymoon phase):** The passage mentions ""hanimun charan"" but not as a factor for difficulty, just as a descriptive phrase for the initial stage of re-entry.
* **D: Tyasta yatri jo sanga dherai dhaireta hudaina (Those travelers who don't have much patience):** While patience is mentioned as something others *think* returnees need, the passage directly links difficulty to the *severity* of the cultural shock, not lack of patience.



"
Yea madhye musa sanga ke garnu hudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Uniharu lai tadha bata hernu** (Don't stare at them).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that deer generally aren't aggressive, *but* if they feel threatened, they will defend themselves. It specifically mentions that if people get too close while observing them (treating them as a potential threat), they might put themselves at risk. Staring directly at a deer can be interpreted as a threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uniharuko upasthiti lai vewaasta garnu** (Ignore their presence) - Ignoring them is okay, but the passage focuses on *how* you interact, not avoiding them entirely.
*   **B: wistarai aghi badhnu** (Approach slowly) - The passage warns against getting too close. Approaching, even slowly, could be perceived as threatening.
*   **C: Uniharu bata hune jokhim lai kam aaknu** (Reduce the risk from them) - This is a general statement, but the passage highlights *how* to reduce the risk - by not threatening them in the first place.

Therefore, the most direct advice from the passage is to avoid behaviors that could be interpreted as threatening, and staring is a key part of that."
Anuchhed anusar musa bare tala madhye kun vakya sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Uniharule aawashyak pare aafno rakshya garna sakchhan** (They can defend themselves if necessary).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""...tar yadi uniharulai kunai khatra mahasus bhayo bhane afulai bachaunechhan."" This translates to ""...but if they feel any danger, they will defend themselves.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uniharu prakritik rupmaa aakramak hunchhan** (They are naturally aggressive) - The passage explicitly states they *don't* naturally act aggressively (""Musa (jaslai elk pani bhaninchha) swabhawik rupma akramak hundainan"").
* **B: Uniharu lai kahile kahi sambhavit jokhim manidaina** (They never perceive any potential danger) - The passage says they *do* perceive danger, and that's when they defend themselves.
* **C: Uniharu lai najik ko manchhe le utprerit garna sakchhan** (People nearby can provoke them) - While the passage mentions people getting too close can be risky, it doesn't say people *provoke* them. It says people can put themselves at risk.



"
Anuchhed anusar marabhumi ko yatri kaa lagi tala madhye kun kura sabai bhanda kam khatarayukta ho?,"The passage states that cold nights in the desert can lead to hypothermia if one doesn't have enough clothing. It also mentions mirages and wasting energy/water as dangerous, but focuses on the *cold* being a significant risk.

Therefore, the least dangerous thing, according to the passage, is **A: Chiso ratimaa nyaano kapada ko abhaav (Lack of warm clothes on cold nights)**.  While it *can* be dangerous (leading to hypothermia), the passage frames it as a risk that can be mitigated with appropriate clothing, making it less inherently dangerous than the deceptive mirages or wasting vital resources.



"
Yea madhye kun kura marabhumi ko yatri kaa lagi sambhavit jokhim manidaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Hypothermia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sabaibhanda garmi marubhumi samet ratma dherai chiso hoon sakha. tato luga bina hypothermia sanchchikai jokhim ho."" This directly translates to ""Even in the hottest deserts, it can get very cold at night. Without clothes, there is a risk of hypothermia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pani ko abhaav (Lack of water):** The text mentions wasting valuable energy and remaining water, implying dehydration is a risk, but hypothermia is *specifically* stated as a risk in the desert at night.
*   **B: Miraga haru (Hallucinations):** The text mentions hallucinations, but frames them as a *result* of danger (heat and dehydration), not the danger itself.
*   **D: Sunburn:** While sunburn is a desert risk, it isn't directly mentioned in the provided text.



"
Anuchhed anusar anweshak ko aagaman le kun samuha ko janasankhya laai sabai bhanda dherai asar garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Taínos**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""European anweshakharuko agamanko kehi thorai warshaharuma, spenka yoddhaharule tenosko janasankhya ullekhaniya rupma come garisakeka thee. Fray bartolom day lass kasas (tratado day lass indias)co adharma 1492 ra 1498co bichma spainy vijetaharule lagbhag 100,000 tynos mare.""

This directly translates to: ""Shortly after the arrival of European explorers, Spanish warriors significantly reduced the Taíno population. Between 1492 and 1498, Spanish conquerors killed approximately 100,000 Taínos.""

Therefore, the arrival of explorers had the most devastating effect on the Taíno population.



"

The passage states: ""caribharu araakan bhasha bolneharu thee jo karib 10,000 isapurvama aeka thee."" This directly translates to ""The Caribs were speakers of the Arawakan language who came around 10,000 years ago.""



"
Skiing lai manoranjanatmak karyakram ko rupma lokpriya banaunu maa kaslai shreya janchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Norwegians**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""sun 1861 maa australiama nerveliharule pahilo sky club kholeka thiye"" which translates to ""in 1861, Norwegians opened the first ski club in Australia."" This directly credits Norwegians with establishing a key component in making skiing a popular recreational activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sky bums:** While ""sky bums"" are enthusiastic skiers, they didn't *initiate* the popularity of skiing as a recreational program. They are a result of it.
*   **C: Gufaa maa basne haru (People living in caves):** Cave paintings show skiing existed a long time ago, but they didn't *popularize* it as a recreational activity.
*   **D: Australians:** Australians hosted the first ski club *opened by Norwegians*, they didn't initiate the popularity of the sport themselves.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Downhill skiing khel kamtima 17aun shatabdidekhi khelidai aieko cha"" which translates to ""Downhill skiing has been played since at least the 17th century.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 18au satabdi (18th century):** While a ski club was *founded* in 1861 (19th century), the text says skiing was played *before* that.
*   **B: 5000 BC:** This refers to the age of the earliest *depictions* of skiing, not when it was played as a sport.
*   **C: 1861:** This is the year the first ski club was opened, not when the sport itself began.

Yea madhye kun lai purvi african tata ko sabai bhanda thulo tapu sanga jodera herne garincha?,"The correct answer is **A: European prabhav** (European influence).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Purvi african tapu hind mahasagarko africako purvi tatama cha. Wanyajantuharuka lagi madagaskar sabaibhanda thulo ra afainma ek mahadweep ho.""  This translates to ""The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, on the east coast of Africa. For animals, Madagascar is the largest island and a major continent in Africa.""

The question asks which of the options is connected to the *largest* island in the East African coast.  The text specifically identifies Madagascar as the largest island. The passage then continues by describing the historical influences on these islands, and the first significant influence mentioned is the arrival of Europeans in the 15th century.  Therefore, European influence is most directly linked to the description of the largest island (Madagascar) and its history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Islamic dharma (Islamic religion):** While Islam *spread* to the Comoros and Mayotte, it doesn't define the island itself as being the largest.
* **C: Jungli wanyajantu (Wild animals):** Animals are mentioned *because* Madagascar is large and supports a lot of wildlife, but they don't *define* the island.
* **D: Vilaasi resort haru (Luxury resorts):** Resorts are a modern feature and don’t relate to the island being the largest.



"
Yea madhye kunle sana purvi african tapu haru lai janaudaina? ,"The correct answer is **A: France sanga ko sambandha (Relationship with France)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dherai jasta sanah tapuharu swatantra rashtraharu hun wa **francesanga sambandhit chan** ra vilasibich resortka rupma parichit chan."" (Many of these islands are independent nations or **are associated with France** and are known as luxurious resorts.)

The question asks what the text identifies about the islands.  The text *specifically* mentions a connection with France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dherai vilasi resort haru (Many luxurious resorts):** While true, the text says they *are known as* luxurious resorts, but doesn't identify it as a defining characteristic *of* the islands themselves.  It's a result of something else.
* **C: Jungle wanyajantu ko lagi pratishtha (Prestige for jungle wildlife):** The text mentions wildlife generally (""Wanyajantuharuka lagi...""), but doesn’t say the islands are *known* for their wildlife prestige.
* **D: Aru muluk haru bata swantrata (Independence from other countries):**  The text states some are independent, but also that many are *associated* with France. So, it’s not a complete or defining characteristic.



"
Anuchhed anusar paramparik church haru maa easter kasari manainchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Suryadaya herera**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dherai paramparagat charchaharule prayaha easter saptahako antyama shanibar rati easter prarthana ayojana gardachan, jasma mandaliharule khrishtako punarutthanlai manauna thyakkai madhyarati utsava gardachan."" which translates to ""Many traditional churches often plan Easter prayers on the last Saturday night of Easter week, in which congregations celebrate midnight festivals to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.""  This implies observing sunrise as part of the Easter celebrations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prajanan anusthan ko aayojana (Organizing fertility rituals)** - The passage mentions the possibility of pre-Christian spring and fertility rites *being the origin* of the tradition, but it doesn't say the churches *organize* those rites.
*   **B: Sanibar rati nigrani (Saturday night vigil)** - While a vigil is mentioned, sunrise observation is the more specific Easter practice described.
*   **C: Bhela ko lagi vasanta mahotsav (Spring festival for gatherings)** - Again, the passage hints at a spring festival origin, but doesn’t say churches celebrate spring festivals.



"
Ecuador pravesh garnu aghi kehi aawashyakta haru bata jogina euta cuban nagarik sanga suru ma ke hunu parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bhraman miti pachhi ko 6 mahina samma manya hune rahadani** (Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tapainko passport kamtima tapainko yatra mitibhanda 6 mahinaka lagi many hunupardacha."" (Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your intended stay).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kanuni rupma garieko nimantrana patra (Legally formalized invitation letter):** While the text mentions a letter from the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry needing validation and requirements, it doesn't specify needing an *invitation letter* specifically. It's a broader requirement for official documentation.
* **C: Vasai ko avadhi pushti garna farkane ticket (Return ticket to prove length of stay):**  The passage mentions needing tickets to *prove the length of stay*, but doesn't say it needs to be a *return* ticket.
* **D: America ko green card (American Green Card):** The passage states a *qualifying* citizen with a US Green Card needs to obtain a commercial visa, but doesn't say a Cuban citizen *needs* a green card to enter Ecuador.



"
Ecuador kaa bhraman aawashakta haru ke kaa lagi design garieko hudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yatri ko vasai avadhi ko pushti garne (To confirm the duration of stay for travelers)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states:

* **""jaane-aune/agadiko yatra tikat tapainko basaiko lambai pramanit garna awashyak hunchha.""** (Return/onward travel tickets are required to certify the length of your stay.)
* **""Tapainko passport kamtima tapainko yatra mitibhanda 6 mahinaka lagi many hunupardacha.""** (Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel date.)

These requirements directly relate to verifying how long a traveler intends to stay in Ecuador.  The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **A: Yatri ko sankhya nyunatam raakhne (To keep the number of travelers minimal):** The text doesn't mention limiting traveler numbers.
* **B: Migration ko bahav laai vyavasthit rakhne (To regulate the flow of migration):** While the requirements might *indirectly* help with migration control, it's not the primary focus.
* **D: Raahadani ko vaidhata lai pushti garne (To confirm the validity of the route):**  The passage doesn't discuss the route itself, only the duration of stay and passport validity.



"
Tala die madhye swadesh bhanda videsh maa kun kura mahango hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Uccha star ko frame** (High-end frames).

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text states: ""...wastawik ayatitharu gharbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakne hunale tyasta kshetrama upalabdha uccha antako brandka name framema dui samasya hoon sakcha.""  This translates to ""...realistic imports can be more expensive than at home, especially in areas with high labor costs, and high-end brand frames in that area can be a problem.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that high-end frames are likely to be more expensive abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aankha jaanch (Eye Exam):** The text suggests considering getting an eye exam at home *before* going abroad, implying it might be cheaper at home, not more expensive abroad.
*   **C: Aankha ko insurance (Eye Insurance):** The text doesn't mention eye insurance.
*   **D: Gair brand kaa frame (Non-brand frames):**  The text focuses on the *high-end* brands being expensive, not the non-brand ones.  It's reasonable to assume non-brand frames could be cheaper abroad.



"
Videsh maa uccha star ko frame kinnu ko sambhavit jokhim ke huna sakchha?,"The most relevant answer to the question ""What are the potential risks of buying high-end frames abroad?"" based on the provided text is **C: Ti nakkali huna sakchhan (They might be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions the risk of counterfeits:**  ""...wasatawik ayatitharu gharbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakne hunale tyasta kshetrama upalabdha uccha antako brandka name framema dui samasya hoon sakcha"" translates to ""...because realistic imports can be more expensive than domestic ones, there can be two problems with high-end brand name frames available in that area [i.e., abroad]."" This strongly suggests concern about authenticity.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **A: Aru thap aankha janch aawashyak huna sakchha (Another eye exam may be necessary):** The text mentions needing an eye exam to get a prescription, but not specifically that *another* one will be required due to buying frames abroad. It's a related issue, but not the primary risk highlighted.
* **B: Prescription kehi frame ko lagi m\\anya na huna sakchha (The prescription may not be valid for some frames):** The text alludes to needing to present the prescription, but doesn't say it will be *invalid* based on where the frames are purchased.
* **D: Insurance le mulya lai na oghatna sakchha (Insurance may not cover the cost):** While this is a possible issue, it's not directly stated in the provided text.



Therefore, **C** is the best and most directly supported answer."
Falklands maa mudra ko prayog baare yea madhye kun vakya sahi ho?,"Sahi jawab **C: Tapu chode pachhi falkland pound satnu parchha** ho.

*   **B:** Stanleyma matra americi dollar swikar gariyo bhayeko ho, sabai tapuharumaa nahunu.

Anuchhed anusaar america bata falkland jada credit card bahek arko madhyam kaha upayogi hola?,"The correct answer is **A: FIC west store maa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...स्टांकों क्रेडिट कार्ड रा सanyukta rajya amerikako dollar swikar garinchha."" (Stanley accepts credit cards and US dollars). It specifically mentions FIC West store in Stanley as a place where credit cards are accepted. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tapu bhari** - The passage doesn't state credit cards are universally accepted across the islands, only that British pounds are.
*   **C: Bahiri tapu harumaa** - The passage explicitly says exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is ""lagbhag asambhawa"" (almost impossible).
*   **D: Stanley bhari** - While Stanley is mentioned, the passage specifically points to the FIC West store *within* Stanley as the place to use credit cards."
Yea madhye kun karyakram mandir ko utsavsanga jodera heridaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Mandir ko warshik utsav**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mandirko warshikotsawko rupma hose wa devtaka janmadin hos wa mandirasanga sambandhit kunai any pramukh karyakramharuko rupma mandirma chadaparwaharu manaincha.""  This translates to: ""The festivals in temples are celebrated in the form of the temple's annual festival, or the birthday of the deity, or any other important event related to the temple.""

While options C and D are *included* within the meaning of 'chadaparwaharu', option B – the temple's annual festival – is the broadest and most encompassing category described in the text.  It's the overarching theme.



"
Sajaieka hatti kaha dekhna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Mandir haru maa** (In the temples).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Susajjit hattiharu, mandirka wadakadal tatha any utsawaharusahitko niyamit lawalskarle garda kerlaka mandirma hune melaharu awalokan garna dherai ramailo hunchha.""  This translates to ""It is very enjoyable to visit the fairs held in Kerala's temples with beautifully decorated elephants, temple bands and other celebrations.""

Therefore, decorated elephants are seen **in the temples**.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun tarikaa le business wa first class maa paisa jogauna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Company ko tarfa bata kharcha garda** (Expenses paid by the company).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pahilo wa wyawasayik wargama udanko spashta tarika bhaneko suawasarko mota rakam banaunu ho (wa ajha ramro, tapainko companyle tapainlai yo garna lagauchha)."" This directly translates to ""A clear way to fly in business or first class is to generate a substantial amount of revenue (or even better, have your company pay for it).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Business ko satta first class ko booking garda** (Booking business instead of first class) - The passage doesn't suggest this as a way to get money for the flights.
* **C: Apratakshya first class udan ko booking garda** (Booking indirect first class flights) - The passage doesn't discuss this.
* **D: Chut khojda** (Looking for discounts) - The passage specifically says ""business wa pratham shreniko sitharuka lagi chhuta khojnu bekar hunechha"" which means looking for discounts for business or first class is useless.



"
Anuchhed anusar kehi shreni ka bhada booking garda yea madhye ke garnu samaya ko barbadi ho?,"The correct answer is **D: First class**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...business ka lagi samanya economy bhadabhanda char gauna badhi ra **pahilo shrenika lagi eghar gunasamma tirne asha garna saknuhunchha**. Samanyataya bhannuparda, a dekhi b samma sidha udanma, business wa pratham shreniko sitharuka lagi chhuta khojnu bekar hunechha.""

This translates to: ""...four times more expensive than a normal economy fare for business class, and can hope to pay eight times more for **first class**. Generally speaking, from A to B on a direct flight, it's not worth looking for discounts for business or first-class seats.""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions that searching for discounts on first-class seats is a waste of time, implying booking them involves a waste of time spent trying to find cheaper options.



"
Africa ko bhada ko dar vishwa bhraman ko bhada ko dar sanga tulana garda ke kura jodnu pardaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Africa bahira kaa thau haru maa lagne bhisa ko thap mulya** (Visa costs for places outside of Africa).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Africa bahirka tee sabai sthanharuka lagi atirikta praeshagya, prasthan curr, sthal yatayat, adika atirikta lagatharuma thapna nabirsanuhos."" This translates to: ""You shouldn't add extra costs for visas, departure taxes, local transportation, etc. for all places outside of Africa.""

The question asks what shouldn't be added when comparing the cost of traveling to Africa with global travel costs.  Since the passage specifically mentions not adding visa costs for *outside* of Africa, that's the key factor being highlighted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Africa ko prasthan kar (Departure tax from Africa):** The passage advises *not* adding extra costs, implying departure taxes are already considered.
* **C: African bhisa ko mulya (African visa cost):**  The comparison is *between* Africa and global travel, so the cost of an African visa would be part of the Africa travel cost, not an extra to add.
* **D: Africa bahira ko thaau haru maa lagne jamin yatayat ko mulya (Ground transportation costs in places outside Africa):**  Similar to option A, but less directly addressed in the passage. The passage focuses on visa costs.



"
Anuchhed anusar supermarket haru le ke kura ko vividh chanot dina thale kaa chan?,"The correct answer is **A: Tayari khana (Prepared food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Badhdai gareka supermarketharule tayari khanaka thap vividh khand rakhiraheka chan."" This directly translates to ""Increasingly, supermarkets are keeping a variety of prepared food sections.""  The passage focuses on the diversity *of the prepared food* available in supermarkets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Microwave ovens:** While the passage mentions microwaves are *available* to heat the food, the diversity isn't *in* the ovens themselves, but in the food options.
* **C: On-site restaurants:** The passage mentions these exist in *some* places, but the primary focus is on supermarket-provided prepared food.
* **D: Kifaayati dar (Affordable prices):** The passage mentions affordability as a benefit of supermarket food, but not as something supermarkets offer in a diverse range.



"
Tayari khana kinne grahak lai supermarket le dine kun suvidhaa aakarshak huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **D: microwave oven**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kehiley tata khana tatauna microwave oven wa any sadhanharu pani upalabdha garaunchhan."" (meaning ""...they also provide microwave ovens or other appliances to heat the food."") This directly addresses a convenience offered by supermarkets for ready-made meals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: On-site restaurants:** While the passage *mentions* restaurants in some stores, it frames them as separate entities offering a different (and slightly less formal) dining experience. It doesn't highlight them as a supermarket-specific benefit.
* **B: Kam vividh chanot (Less variety):** The passage actually says supermarkets have ""thap vividh khand"" (a wide variety) of ready-made foods.
* **C: Kaacho khana (Raw food):** The question is specifically about *ready-made* food.



"
Yea madhye french bolne belgian ra swisle ke nabujhna sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Manak french sankhya pranali**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Belgian and Swiss schools teach *standard French* (manak French), including the standard number system (sankhya pranali). This ensures that people from France can understand them. The passage mentions differences in number systems as a slight variation, but ultimately emphasizes the use of standard French for mutual understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Anautha french sabdaharu (Unique French words):** The passage mentions *some* vocabulary differences, but doesn't suggest this is the main reason for potential misunderstanding.
*   **C: French sabda ko kehi uccharan (Some pronunciation of French words):** Similar to vocabulary, pronunciation differences are mentioned as minor variations, not a significant barrier to understanding.
*   **D: France maa boline praya french (French spoken in France):** The passage is *comparing* the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland *to* the French spoken in France. It's not asking about the French spoken in France itself.



"
Yea madhye kun kura france maa bhae jastai belgium ra switzerland maa chainana?,"The correct answer is **B: Sankhya pranali**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vishesh gari, francema bolne frenchbhanda french bhashi belgium ra swizerlandma sankhya pranaliko kehi halka bhinna cha..."" which translates to ""Specifically, the number system for French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland is slightly different than that of French speakers in France.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sabai sabda ko uccharan (Pronunciation of all words):** The passage says there *are* some differences in pronunciation (""kehi shabdaharuko uchcharan kehi farak cha"").
*   **C: Vidhyalaya maa padhaine manak french (Teaching standard French in schools):**  The passage states that students in Belgium and Switzerland *learn* standard French.
*   **D: Kehi french sabda ko hijje (Spelling of some French words):** The passage doesn't mention spelling differences, only pronunciation.

*   **B: Tesro-party sewa bhanda sidhai wayusewaa sanga book garda** - Prastavama sidhai airlinesanga phone garera book garnu pardacha vanne ullekh chha.
*   **D: Delta maa udan garda** - Delta pani shok bhada pradan garnaka airlinesharu maa ek ho."
Shok bhada baare ke sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Yaslai phone bata wayusewa sanga sidha book garnu parchha** (It must be booked directly with the airline by phone).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sabai awasthaharuma, tapainle phone marfat sidhai airlinesanga book garnu pardachha."" (In all cases, you must book directly with the airline by phone.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yasle antyasti kharcha behorchha** (It reduces funeral expenses) - While the passage says it *slightly* reduces the cost of the final journey, it doesn't directly say it reduces overall funeral costs.
* **B: Yaslai wayusewa ko website bata sidhai book garnu parchha** (It must be booked directly from the airline's website) - The passage specifically states it must be booked *by phone*, not online.
* **C: Yasle antim samaya maa aayera garine bhraman ko kharcha behorchha** (It reduces the cost of travel arriving at the last minute) - This is true, but it's not the main point about how to *access* the bereavement fare.



"
Kun awastha maa GPS navigation app bhanda standalone gps upakaran prayog garnu sahaj hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jaba tapai dayarabhanda bahira hunu hunchha** (When you are outside of cellular range).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yadi tapainsanga afno foneka lagi data jadan chhaina bhane wa yo dayarabhanda bahira hunda, tiniharuko pradarshan simit wa anupalabdha hoon sakha.""  This translates to: ""If you don't have data for your phone or you are outside of cellular range, their performance may be limited or unavailable.""

This means a standalone GPS device (which doesn't rely on cellular data) is more useful when you're *outside* of cell service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jaba tapai paisa jogauna khojdai hununchha** (When you are looking to save money) - The passage *mentions* saving money, but doesn't suggest standalone GPS is better for that *specifically*.
* **B: Jaba tapai data connection cha bhanne maa vishwasta hunu hunchha** (When you are confident you have a data connection) -  This is the *opposite* of when a standalone GPS would be preferred.
* **D: Jaba tapai upakaran bhada maa lina chahanu hunna** (When you don't want to rent equipment) - The passage only briefly mentions renting GPS and doesn't relate it to when a standalone device is better.



"
Standalone upakaran bhanda gps navigation app prayog nagarne karan ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Paisa ko bachat** (Saving money).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that using a smartphone's GPS navigation app can save you money by avoiding the need to:

*   Buy GPS maps
*   Buy GPS devices
*   Rent GPS from car rental companies

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Data connection bare chinta linu naparne** (Not having to worry about data connection) - The passage actually states the *opposite* - that performance can be limited or unavailable *without* a data connection.
*   **C: Bhada baata joginu** (Adding to rental costs) - The passage says it *saves* money on rentals.
*   **D: Naya naksa kinna naparne** (Not having to buy new maps) - While true, this is *part of* the overall reason for saving money, not the primary reason to choose the app over a standalone device.



"
Anuchhed anusar tapai upayukta jahaz sanga jodinu bhayo bhanne ko guarantee ke ho?,"Correct answer is **C: Galapagosko bhraman maa viseshagyata rakhne travel agent sanga booking garnu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Afule june agentka madhyambata book garnuhunchha ukta agent vibhinna prakarka jahajharubare ramro gyan bhaeka galapagos visheshagya hun bhane kurako sunishchit garnuhos. Yasale nishchit gardacha key tapainka vishesh ruchiharu ra wa simitataharu uniharuka lagi sabaibhanda upayukta jahajka sath mileka chan."" (You should ensure that the agent you book through is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of different types of ships. This will ensure that you are matched with the most suitable ship for your specific interests and limitations.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ustai ruchi bhaeka 8 bhanda badi yatru haru ko samuha maa booking garnu** - While the passage mentions group size, it doesn't guarantee suitability based on it.
*   **B: Kam season ko bela booking garnu** - The passage mentions low season for price benefits but not for finding the *right* ship.
*   **D: Agrim booking garnu** -  Early booking is hinted at as potentially helpful but doesn't guarantee finding a suitable ship for your needs.



"
Pahuna lai juwaa khelai raakhna kun tarika ko prayog garidaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Gadhi ko abhav** (Lack of clocks).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""jhyal ra ghadiharu pry rakhieka hunan ra bahira niscan gahro hoon sakha"" which translates to ""It is beneficial to keep calendars and clocks out of sight as it makes it harder for outsiders to determine time."" This means removing clocks is a tactic used to keep guests gambling longer, as they lose track of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prakritik prakash ko prachurta** (Abundance of natural light) - The passage doesn't mention anything about natural light.
*   **B: Nisulka concert ticket ko prohotsaan** (Promotion of free concert tickets) - While entertainment is mentioned (""manoranjanka karyaharu""), free concert tickets are not specifically highlighted as a tactic.
*   **C: Thap payee padartha** (Mild intoxicating substances) - The passage mentions intoxicating substances but clarifies that responsible casinos prioritize keeping gamblers calm, suggesting it's not a standard practice.



"
Anuchhed anusar euta chalakh juwadele ke kura bata joginu parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dherai madira piune** (Drinking a lot of alcohol).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""यद्यपि मतावलपनले न्यायलाई बाधा पुऱ्याउँछ र सबै राम्रा जुवाडेहरूले शान्त रहनुको महत्त्व जान्दछन्।"" (Although intoxication hinders judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.) This directly implies that a clever gambler needs to *avoid* drinking too much.  The passage notes some places *offer* alcohol, but the best gamblers are aware of the negative consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Prohotsan lai swikarne** (Accepting encouragement) - The passage doesn’t discuss accepting encouragement.
*   **C: Ghadi herne** (Looking at the watch) - The passage mentions keeping track of time, but doesn't link it to being a clever gambler.
*   **D: Najik raheko bahira jane dhoka bare sodhpuchh garne** (Asking nearby outsiders about risks) - The passage talks about being wary of outsiders, but doesn't suggest actively *asking* them about risks.



"
Anuchhed anusar wakya ko bichma boliko kun bhag lai capitalized garinchha,"The correct answer is **B: Nam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tapainka lagi ca shabd sangasangai wakyako bichma pani sabai **namharu** sadhain thulo aksharbata suru hunchha."" (For you, and in every sentence with words, all **nouns** always start with a capital letter).

The passage specifically says that **nouns** (namharu) are capitalized in the middle of sentences. The other options (verb, adjective, adverb) are not mentioned in relation to capitalization in this context.



"
Anuchhed anusar nam lai capitalize garna le kun kura kathin banchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Lekhai (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yasale yathochit rupma padhna sajilo pani banaundachha, **yadyapi lekhanma kehi kriya wa visheshan prayog garieko cha wa chhaina bhane kura patta lagaunaka lagi awashyak cha.**""

This translates to: ""It also makes reading easier, **although it is necessary to pay attention to whether or not some verbs or adjectives are used in writing.**""

This means capitalizing names makes *reading* easier, but requires extra attention when *writing* to identify verbs and adjectives that might be missed due to the capitalization rule.  Therefore, capitalization presents a difficulty in **writing**.



"
Malaysia ko durgam sthan haruma kasto ishara le bhetna aau bhanne bujhinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Chori aunlaa dobryaunu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadyapi malesiama, kamtima gramin ilakama maleharuma, yasako earth """"bhetna au"""" bhane hunchha, shariratarfa chore aunlaa jhukaieko jastai...""  This translates to: ""Although in Malaysia, especially in rural areas, this is understood as 'come meet,' it's like leaning the body sideways.""

Therefore, ""chori aunlaa dobryaunu"" (leaning the body sideways) is the signal used to mean ""come meet"" in rural Malaysian areas.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun isara le farki aau bhanne bujhincha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hatkela bhitra farkayera haat hallaunu** (Waving hand with palm facing inward).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Tyastai, spenka belayati yatrile haat hallaune wyaktitarfa hatkela farkaera (bidai garieko wyaktitarfa farkaunuko satta) bidai bhaniekolai farkera aune ishara sochna sakchhan.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, Spanish and British travelers might interpret waving with the palm facing inward (instead of outward towards the person being bid farewell) as a 'come here' signal.""

Therefore, waving with the palm *inward* is the signal the passage describes as being misinterpreted.



"
Anuchhed anusar himdarar ke le banaauchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Asthir himnadi** (Unstable glacier).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Himnadi sthira chhainan, tar pahadbata tall bagdachan."" This translates to ""The glacier is not stable, but flows down from the mountains.""  The passage then explains how this movement *creates* glaciers and icefalls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hiun pul (Warm puddle):** The passage mentions warm puddles being stopped by ice, but doesn't say they *create* icefalls.
*   **C: Bhatkeko himagufa (Wandering ice cave):** The passage mentions ice caves being formed *by* the glacier, not creating it.
*   **D: Khukulo dhikka (Small incline):** This isn't mentioned as a creator of icefalls in the passage.



"
Anuchhed anusar hiun pul le yea madhye ke lai chopchha?,"The correct answer is **A: chiraharu (birds)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...june hiun pulharudwara rokin sakdachha."" which translates to ""...which June can stop with bird wings."" This directly indicates that the bird wings (hiun pul) are used to stop the birds (chiraharu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Himagufa (Ice caves):** The passage mentions ice caves but doesn't say the bird wings stop them.
* **C: Bhitta (Walls):**  Walls are mentioned as something *inside* the ice caves, not something the birds stop.
* **D: Thulo dhikka haru (Large slopes):** The passage discusses slopes, but not in connection with being stopped by bird wings.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun sthan ko bhraman garnu aghi yatru haru le thap sawadhani apnaunu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Goma waripari ko kshetra haru** (Areas outside of Goma).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Goma yathochit surakshit bhae tapani goma bahirka kunai pani bhramanharuma uttari kibhu prantama raheko sangharshako awastha bujhna anusandhan garnu parchha.""  This translates to: ""While Goma is reasonably safe, any traveler must research the state of conflict in the northern Kivu province outside of Goma.""

This directly indicates travelers need to be cautious outside the city of Goma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyiragongo jwalamukhi (Nyragongo volcano):** While the passage mentions the volcano destroyed part of Goma, it doesn't say travelers need to be cautious *at* the volcano, only that it's a destination.
*   **C: Sahar ko kendra (City center):** The passage states the city center was destroyed but also says Goma is ""reasonably safe"".
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda isn't mentioned as a place requiring caution in the passage.



"
Yea madhye goma ko paryatak kaa lagi kun sujhav upayukta hudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo kifaayati Mountain Gorilla Tracking ko lagi upayukta sthaan ho** (This is a suitable place for affordable Mountain Gorilla Tracking).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Yo sahar africako sabaibhanda sasto mountain gorilla trackingko sathai nirangongo jwalamukhi chadhnaka lagi adhaar pani ho."" (This city is a base for the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa, as well as for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uttari kivu kaa udaan ramailo hunchha** (Flying over North Kivu is beautiful) - The text doesn't mention anything about flying or the beauty of the area from above.
* **C: Motorcycle taxi ghumna ko lagi upayukta hunchhan** (Motorcycle taxis are suitable for sightseeing) - While the text *mentions* boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis), it doesn't *recommend* them as a tourist activity, and even notes the need for caution due to the conflict.
* **D: Nyiragongo jwalamukhi ko fed sahar maa awasthit chha** (The city is located at the foot of the Nyiragongo volcano) - The text says Goma is a base *for climbing* the volcano, not that it's *at its foot*.  The text also describes the damage the volcano caused.



"
August maa Suru ko miti ko lagi backcountry anumati kahile upalabdha hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: 1 april**.

Here's why:

The text states that permits become available four months before the start month. August is the start month, so four months prior would be April.
"
Canyon ko suraksha garna kun niti lyaieko chha?,"Correct answer is **D: Simit sankhyaka anumati haru**.

Here's why:

The passage states that permits are ""limited to protect resources"" (सुरक्षिका लागि सीमित गरिएका छन्) and that popular areas often fill up quickly through the first-come, first-served request system. This clearly indicates a policy of limiting the number of permits issued to manage and protect the canyon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jo suru maa aauchha usailai anumati dine pranaali (First-come, first-served system):** While true for *some* permits (specifically for popular campgrounds), it's not the overarching safety policy. It's a *method* of distributing limited permits.
*   **B: Anumati haru 1 january maa matra upalabdha chhan (Permits are only available on January 1st):** The passage says permits become available four months before the start month, not just on January 1st.
*   **C: Anumati haru walk-in anurodh dwara matrai prapta huncha (Permits are only obtained through walk-in requests):** The passage mentions requests, but doesn't state they *must* be walk-in.



"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieka hotel harumaa ke bhetidaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Aadhunik upgrade sahit bharkharai marmat gariekaa kotha haru** (Rooms extensively renovated with modern upgrades).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the hotels *lack* modern amenities (""naya suwidha abhawa""). It emphasizes they retain their old style (""purano shailika fittingharu"") and have a certain nostalgic feel.  Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as features *present* in these hotels:

* **A: cocktail bar** - Implied through ""ratko jeevan"" (nightlife).
* **B: onsite gourmet restaurant** - Explicitly mentioned as ""ramro bhojan"" (good food).
* **C: Parichit wa lokpriya pahuna haru** (Familiar or popular guests) -  The passage states they hosted ""dhani ra dinka prasidha wyaktiharu"" (wealthy and famous people) and ""rajya pramukh ra any pratishthit wyaktiharu"" (heads of state and other dignitaries).

Therefore, modern renovations are the one thing *not* found in these hotels.



"
Anuchhed maa prastut garieko jaankaari anusaar yea madhye kun suvidhaa hotel kaa pahuna harule kam prathamikta maa rakchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Hotel bhari rahekaa antique sajawat**.

Here's why:

The passage states the hotels are known for their ""purano shailika fittingharu"" (old-style fittings) and being a part of history. It emphasizes the charm and character derived from their historical design. While the passage mentions good food and nightlife, it frames these as *features* of the hotels, not the primary reason people chose them.  The emphasis is on the luxurious, historical atmosphere. The text doesn't mention affordable rates at all.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: Prasidha chef bhaeko restaurant:**  Good food is *mentioned*, but it's not presented as the defining feature.
* **C: Ratri manoranjan pradan garne lounge:** Similar to B, nightlife is a feature, not the core draw.
* **D: Kifayati room dar:** The passage suggests these hotels catered to wealthy individuals, making affordable rates unlikely.



"
Anuchhed anusar greenland ghumna jane yatru le kun kura bata joginu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Varsha bhari mausam tato hune bhaekaa le bhari luga** (Bringing warm clothes due to the cold weather).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Yadi tapain chiso mausam greenland bhraman garnuhunchha bhane (jati utter tapain januhunchha, tyati chiso hunchha bhane kurlai dhyanma rakhdai) paryapta nano kapda lyauna awashyak cha."" (If you are traveling to Greenland in cold weather (the further north you go, the colder it is), it is necessary to bring plenty of warm clothes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aparadh ko uccha dar bhaeka kehi kshetra haru** (Areas with high crime rates): The passage specifically states that crime is almost unknown in Greenland, even in cities.
*   **C: Kamjor internet connection kaa karan le online kam garne apeksha rakhnu** (Expecting weak internet connection to work online): The passage mentions improved internet access in Greenland.
*   **D: Greenland kaa aadivasi lai “eskimo” bhanera bolaunu** (Calling the indigenous people of Greenland ""Eskimo""): The passage warns *against* using the word ""Eskimo"" as it is considered offensive by many Arctic people, especially in Canada and by the Inuit and Kalaallit themselves.



"
Anuchhed anusar bina tayari greenland bhraman garne yatri kaa lagi kun kura kathin huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mausam**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Chiso mausam shayed tayari nagareka manisharule samana gareko ek matri wastawik khatra hoon sakchha."" (Cold weather might be the only real danger for people who travel to Greenland unprepared.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nordic machad (Nordic mosquitoes):** While mentioned, they are said to not *spread* disease, just be annoying.
*   **B: Aparadh (Crime):** The passage says crime is almost unknown in Greenland.
*   **D: Sthaniya (Locals):** The passage states that hostility towards foreigners is almost non-existent.



"
Yea madhye kun ahile kendriya plaza kaa rupma prayog hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kendriya plazako rupma un yasale karya garchha ra sandhai dina-raat thuprai chijharu hundai gairaheka chan."" which translates to ""The form of the central plaza works in it and the market is busy day and night with twinkling lights.""  This directly links the central plaza to *Jardín de la Unión*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: The Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso)** - The text mentions this as a very narrow street (69cm wide) with a love story, but doesn't say it's the central plaza.
*   **C: Templo de San Diego** - The text states this is the *only living building* within the atrium, not the central plaza itself.
*   **D: Callejon del Beso** - Same as B, it's a specific alleyway, not the main plaza.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun jardin de la unioun maa paidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Concert bhaeko kendriya gajebo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""diunso ra beluka tyahan prayaha kendriya gajebobata diine n concertharu hunchhan"" (evenings and nights there are concerts in the central gazebo). This means the central gazebo *hosts* concerts, it isn't something *found* within the garden itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Purano prem katha ko ghar (Old love story house)**: The passage specifically mentions ""Callegon dell beso (chumbanko galli). matra 69 centimetres alaggieko purano prem adarsh charitrako ghar ho"" – it’s *in* the garden.
* **C: Bagaicha tarfa farkieko restaurant (Restaurant facing the garden)**:  The passage states ""Tyahan bagaincha waripari thuprai resturentharu chan"" – restaurants are *in* the garden.
* **D: Purano convent bhawan (Old convent building)**: The passage begins by stating the garden was built around a 17th-century convent, with the temple being the only surviving building from it.  This is a core element of the garden.



"
Anuchhed anusar din ko paidal yatra bare kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Sanah bacha bhaeka pariwar kaa lagi bahira hune din ko paidal yatra upayukta hudaina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sanah bachchaharu sahitka pariwarharulai thap tayariharu awashyak parna sakha, tara bachcha ra pri-schoolka bachchaharusanga pani dinma ghar bahira niscan sajilai sambhawa hunchha.""  This translates to: ""Families with older children may need some preparation, but it is easily possible to go out with children and preschool children during the day.""  This directly contradicts option D, which claims it's *not* suitable for families with older children.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Sajilo marga maa din maa paidal yatra garda thorai tayari le pugchha** - The passage mentions ""Sajilo batoma ek dine paidal yatraka lagi kehi tayariharu awashyak hunchhan"" (Some preparations are necessary for a day's hike on an easy route).
*   **B: Duri farak huna sakchha tara ek din maa oghati saknu parchha** - The passage states ""Dinko paidal yatrama ekai dinma sampanna garna sakine ek mailbhanda come dekhi lamo duree samawesh hunchha."" (A day's hike can range from a short distance to a long distance).
*   **C: Kam furtila manisharu le yas maa ramauna sakchhan** - While not explicitly stated, the passage implies enjoyment can be had (""feat wyaktile tiniharuko ananda lynn sakha"" - people can enjoy it). This suggests those who enjoy walking can participate.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun bela din ko paidal yatra ko lagi nyunatam tayari aawashyak huncha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaba bato sajilo chha (When the path is easy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Sajilo batoma ek dine paidal yatraka lagi kehi tayariharu awashyak hunchhan..."" which translates to ""For a day's hike on an *easy path*, some preparations are necessary..."" This directly implies that fewer preparations are needed when the path is easy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jaba paidal yatri saririk rupmaa tandarusta chha (When the hiker is physically fit):** While fitness is important, the passage doesn't link it to *minimum* preparation.
* **C: Jaba balbalika paidal yatra maa janechhan (When children are going on the hike):**  The passage actually suggests *more* preparation is needed with children, not less.
* **D: Jaba paidal yatra prakritik watawaran maa garinchha (When the hike is in a natural environment):** The passage mentions natural environments as a characteristic of hikes, but doesn't say it reduces preparation.



"
Baki norway bhanda rogaland wa agder ma raheka uccha samasthali haru ma ke bhinnata chha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ti praya heather le bhariekaa hunchhan**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that in Rogaland and Agder, the high places are *usually* called ""hei"" which are described as covered, previously, in barren, open moorland.  ""Heather"" is a type of moorland plant.
* The passage contrasts this with the general Norwegian concept of high places (""bide"") being open, treeless spaces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tyaha rukh chhainan (There are no trees there)** – The passage mentions ""bide"" are treeless, so this isn't a *difference* specific to Rogaland and Agder.
* **B: Tyaha fyord chainan (There are no fjords there)** – The passage starts by describing Norway as having fjords, but doesn't mention if they're absent in Rogaland/Agder.
* **C: Uccha samasthali haru praya saman chhan (The high places are pretty similar)** – The passage explicitly describes a *difference* in the type of landscape found on the high places of Rogaland/Agder compared to the general Norwegian ""bide.""



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun norway ko lagi swabhavik hoina?","The passage describes Norwegian landscapes with fjords, valleys, high plateaus (""bide""), and moorlands (""hei""). It specifically states the high plateaus are ""chauda, khula rukhwihin antariksha"" (wide, open, treeless space). 

The passage implies that open land is characteristic of the ""bide"" plateaus and moorlands are called ""hei"" in certain regions. Fjords and valleys are explicitly mentioned as features of Norway.

However, the passage states the high plateaus are **""rukhwihin"" (treeless)**.  This strongly suggests that **jungle-covered high plateaus (B: Jungle bhaeko uccha samasthali)** are *not* a natural feature of Norway, according to the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Jungle bhaeko uccha samasthali**.



"
Skiing maa ruchi bhaeka paryatak le kahile parwat station ko bhraman garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Peak season maa**.

Here's why:

* **P mentions:** ""...dherai pahadi stationharule swastha matrama hiun pairaheko cha ra skiing ra snoboardingjasta gatiwidhiharu pradan gardachan."" (Many hill stations have enough snow and provide activities like skiing and snowboarding).
* Skiing and snowboarding *require* snow.
* **Peak season** for hill stations, especially those offering winter sports, is when there's likely to be sufficient snowfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jado maa (In summer):**  The passage states hill stations are popular *during* the Indian summer, but it's not the time for skiing.
* **C: Indian garmi maa (In Indian summer):** Same reasoning as above.  People go *to escape* the heat, not to ski.
* **D: Vasanta maa (In spring):** While spring can sometimes have snow, it's generally melting and unreliable for skiing.



"
Anuchhed anusar parwat station haruma kahile dherai paryatak hunchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Indian garmi maa** (During Indian summer).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Parwat stationharuka lagi paryatakiya mausam **bharatiya garmiko awadhima** sadharantaya wriddhi hunchha."" This directly translates to ""For hill stations, the tourist season generally increases **during the Indian summer**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dherai hiun parda** (Very cold) - The passage doesn't focus on cold weather attracting tourists.
*   **B: snoboarding ko season maa** (During the snowboarding season) - While some hill stations *offer* snowboarding, the passage doesn't say this is when they are most crowded.
*   **D: jado mahina bhari** (During the cold months) - Similar to option A, the passage emphasizes the summer, not the cold.



"
Yadi tapai sahayog ko lagi dunga khojdai hununchha bhane ke nagarna upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aafno sewa ko prachar garnu (Promote your services)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where you're offering assistance to people on boats, cleaning, and connecting with sailors. This implies you are *offering a service* in exchange for something (presumably money or goods).  Therefore, proactively letting people know what you can do (promoting your services) is the most logical course of action.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Dock tala mathi garnu (Climb on the dock):** This is a physical action, but doesn't relate to finding work.
*   **B: Captain sanga mitrata gasnu (Make friends with the captain):** While networking can be helpful, it's not a direct way to find work.
*   **D: Dunga kaa aru yatru haru lai vevasta garnu (Organize other travelers on the boat):** This suggests you're taking on a management role, which isn’t implied in the passage.



"
Sahayog ko lagi dunga ko khoji garda marinas ko waripari ke garnu prarchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sailor sanga samparka garnu (Contact the sailor)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""barma nawikharusanga sampark gurney prayas gardai hunu hune cha"" which translates to ""you will need to try to contact the boat sailors.""  This is a direct instruction related to helping while searching for a ride on a boat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Radar muni basnu (Sit under the radar):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about radar.
* **C: Uniharula yachat safa gariraheko bela matra najik janu (Only approach when they are cleaning the yacht):** The passage says to approach while they are cleaning *and* generally offer help, not just during cleaning.
* **D: Aru hitchhiker bata tadhai rahanu (Stay away from other hitchhikers):** The passage says you *will* meet other people looking for rides and they will share information with you - the opposite of staying away.



"
Tapu ko aupaniveshik itihas ko bare maa ruchi rakhne paryatak ko lagi kun sthan upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari kinara (Northern shore)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Belayatle yo sthan afno upaniweshka rupma lie ra tapain kshetrako aupaniweshik wigatka pramanharu khojdai hunuhunchha bhane suru garnaka lagi yo ramro sthan ho."" (If you want to start looking for historical evidence of this place as a British colony, this is a good place to start.)  and ""Hangkangka sarwashreshtha drishyaharu prapta garnaka lagi, tapu chhodnuhos ra kovuluna waterfrontko viparit januhos. Hangkang tapuko adhikansh sahari wikasko punah kabza garieko bhumiko **uttari bank** ghana rupma bharieko cha."" (To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go opposite the Kowloon waterfront. The **northern bank** of Hong Kong Island is densely filled with land reclaimed from most of the urban development of Hong Kong.)

This clearly indicates the northern shore (uttari kinara) is where much of the colonial-era urban development occurred and therefore the place to look for colonial historical evidence.



"
Manmohak drishya lai prathamikta maa rakhne paryatak ko lagi kun sthan upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hangkangka sarwashreshtha drishyaharu prapta garnaka lagi, tapu chhodnuhos ra kovuluna waterfrontko viparit januhos."" This translates to: ""To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and face the Kowloon waterfront.""

Therefore, the Kowloon waterfront is directly recommended as the best place for a tourist prioritizing a beautiful view.



"
Rikab maa sawari garne ko khutta aljhine jokhim kam garna kehi gadi maa ke hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Surkasha patti** (Safety straps).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Aba, kehi gaddiharu, vishesh gari belayati gaddiharuma suraksha pattiharu chan jasle yadi ladna lageko sawarikartale pachadi tanyo bhane ek rikab chhalalai gaddibata tall jhardachha.""  This translates to ""Now, some carriages, especially British carriages, have safety straps that, if a rider falls backward, will drop a rikab (shaft) from the carriage."" This directly addresses reducing the risk of a horse running over someone who has fallen from the rikab.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sanghuro paitala (Strong sole):** While strong soles are mentioned as being worn by drivers previously, they don't directly prevent the risk of being run over.
*   **C: Chhalako rikab (Driver's rikab):**  This refers to the driver's seating area, not a safety feature for passengers on the rikab.
*   **D: Dherai sthirta (Much stability):**  Stability is helpful, but doesn't *prevent* injury if someone falls. The safety straps are a specific protective measure.



"
Sawari jutta ko kun viseshata le rikab prayog garda sawari garne ko suraksha badhauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Khasro ra sanghuro paitala** (Strong and tight soles).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suruma, pry chalakharule hill ra naram, **ekdamai sanghuro sole bhaeka butharu** lagaundai thee."" (Initially, drivers used to wear shoes with strong and very tight soles.) This directly connects strong, tight soles to increased safety when riding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chala** (Leather) - While shoes might be *made* of leather, the passage doesn't emphasize leather as the safety feature.
* **C: Taluwa** (Sole) - Simply mentioning ""sole"" isn't enough. It's the *strength and tightness* of the sole that matters.
* **D: Farakilo paitala** (Thin soles) - This is the opposite of what the passage describes; thin soles would offer *less* protection.



"
Aatithya aadanpradaan sanjal maa yatri lai ke prastav garinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sthaniya host sanga awas**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Atithi sewa adanpradan sanjal bhaneko tyo sangathan ho jasle yatrilai tiniharu ghumna jaan lageka saharharuma **sthaniyaharusanga jodchhan**."" This translates to: ""Hospitality exchange network is an organization that connects travelers with **locals** in the cities they visit.""  This directly implies offering accommodation with local hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sasto udan:** The passage mentions Couchsurfing was *inspired* by finding cheap flights, but the network itself doesn't offer flights.
*   **C: Sthaniya guide dwara tour:** While locals might *offer* tours, the passage doesn't state this is a primary function of the network.
*   **D: Eutai gantavya bhraman garne aru yatru haru sanga samparka:** The passage mentions reviews *from* other travelers, but not necessarily facilitating travel *with* them.



"
Anuchhed anusar aathitya aadanpradaan sanjal sambandhi kun kura sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yatri haru lai jahile sthaniya host ko lagi sandharva pradan garinchha** (The network always provides references for local hosts to travelers).

Here's why:

The passage states the network *connects* travelers with locals, and provides a *list of available hosts* with *references and reviews * **from other travelers**. It doesn't say the network provides references *for* the hosts themselves.  It's the travelers who provide references *about* the hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

*   **B: Kehi sanjal haru lai yatru ko thap pramarikarn aawashyak parcha** (Some networks require traveler identification) - The passage explicitly mentions ""kehi sanjalharule atirikta pramanikaran magchhan wa aniwarya garchhan"" (some networks request or require additional verification).
*   **C: Yatri hari lai gantavya sahar maa upalabdha host haru ko suchi pradan garinchha** (Provides a list of available hosts in the destination city to travelers) - The passage says it ""pradan garinchha, kahinlekaahin any yatriharudwara sandarbha ra samikshako sath diinchha"" (provides a list, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers).
*   **D: Kahile kahi sthaniya host ko samiksha yatru haru lai upalabdha garainchha** (Makes reviews of local hosts available to travelers) - The passage mentions reviews being available *from* other travelers, making this statement true.



"
Anuchhed anusar sajha hostel kothama kasto prakaar ko pahuna bhetne sambhavana kam huncha?,"The correct answer is **A: Wishau varsha ko pahuna** (Guests of a certain age - specifically, older guests).

Here's why:

* The passage states hostels *primarily* cater to young people (""yuva vyaktiharulai khan-panko prabandha gardachan"") and are specifically known for a certain age group (""wishatabdiko wishishta pahuna"").  However, it *also* says older travelers (""bridha yatriharu"") can be found there, but are less common.
* The passage explicitly mentions families with children are rare (""bachchaharu bhaeka pariwarharu durlabh drishya hun"").
* There's nothing in the passage about travelers traveling alone or specific age groups like 30-35.

Therefore, the least likely type of guest to find in a shared hostel, according to the passage, is an older guest (those not fitting the typical young demographic)."
Anuchhed anusar hostel maa basne sambawana kasko badhi hunchha?,"Correct answer is **B: Sangai ghumne 22 varshiya tin janaa**

Here's why:

* **The passage states hostels primarily cater to young people (""yuva vyaktiharulai"").** A group of 22-year-olds fits this demographic perfectly.
* The passage also mentions older travelers *can* be found in hostels, but young people are the main clientele.
* The passage states families with children are rare (""bachchaharu bhaeka pariwarharu durlabh drishya"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bharkhar janmeko bacha liera ghumne jodi:** Families with children are rare.
* **C: 70 varsha nagheko ek jodi:** While possible, the hostel primarily targets younger people.
* **D: Aafna chorachori sanga ghumne dui pariwar:**  Families with children are rare.

Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun wakya le boomerang throwing lai sahi rupma janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yadi sahi tarika le fyakne ho bhane yo farkera aafnai haat maa aauchha (If thrown correctly, it returns to your own hand)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tapain afno hatma farkera aune bummeryang fyaankna sikna chahanuhunchha bhane afutira farkera aune uchit khalko bummeryang cha bhane kurako sunishchit garnuhos."" (If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that returns to your hand, make sure you get a properly returning, lightweight boomerang.) This directly defines what a proper boomerang does – it returns when thrown correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yo paryatak bhanda sthaaniya bich badhi lokpriya chha (It is more popular among locals than tourists):** The passage mentions tourists *like* it, but doesn't compare its popularity to locals.
* **C: Austrailia maa dherai boomerang upalabhdha chainan (There aren't many boomerangs available in Australia):** The passage actually says most boomerangs *in* Australia don't return.
* **D: Kehi boomerang matrai farkina sakchhan (Only some boomerangs can return):** While true, this doesn't *define* boomerang throwing; it just states a characteristic.  Option A explains the core function of a returning boomerang.



"
Javanese khana maa visesh gari ke ko prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Nariwal ko chiny**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""jabhanese nariwal chiny"" (Javanese coconut sugar) as a key ingredient used in Javanese cuisine, alongside almonds, chilies, and various spices. 

The other options are not mentioned in the text.

Anuchhed anusar sankraman rog kasari failinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sankramit manis** (Infected person).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Sankramit wyaktiko chheuchhauma rahanda sajilai sarne rog sankramak rog ho.**"" This translates to ""Diseases that easily spread from the touch/contact of an infected person are infectious diseases.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rogjanak** (Pathogen) - While pathogens *cause* infectious diseases, the passage focuses on *how* they spread.
* **C: Bacterium** (Bacterium) - Bacteria are a *type* of pathogen, not the method of spread.
* **D: Khop** (Vaccination) - The passage mentions vaccinations in the context of travelers needing them, but it doesn’t state they *spread* the disease.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun le garda sankraamak rog nahune maanincha?,"The correct answer is **A: Khop**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sankramak rog bhairas, bacteria, fungus jasta rogjanak wa any parajiwiharule garda hune rog ho."" (Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasites).  Then it continues: ""Sankramit wyaktiko chheuchhauma rahanda sajilai sarne rog sankramak rog ho."" (Diseases that easily spread from the touch of an infected person are infectious diseases.) And finally: ""Dherai sarkarharulai bhraman garna praesh gareka agantukharu wa desh chhodera gaeka basindaharule **khop** lagauna awashyak cha."" (Many governments require travelers or residents leaving the country to get **vaccinations**).

This indicates that vaccinations (khop) are a preventative measure *against* infectious diseases. The passage doesn't state that vaccinations *cause* infectious diseases, but rather help prevent them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Virus:** Viruses *cause* infectious diseases, they don't prevent them.
*   **C: Bacteria:** Bacteria *cause* infectious diseases, they don't prevent them.
*   **D: Fungus:** Fungi *cause* infectious diseases, they don't prevent them.



"
Kasto awastha maa prayogkarta lai vyaktigat vpn pradayak bhanda web proksi ko chanot garda paryapta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Prayogkarta http traffic reroute garna chahanchhan**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that web proxies *only* handle HTTP traffic, while VPNs handle *all* internet traffic. If a user *only* needs to reroute HTTP traffic, a web proxy is sufficient.  The passage highlights that VPNs are superior when more comprehensive redirection is needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prayogkarta le sabai traffic reroute garna chaanchhan:** If the user needs to reroute all traffic, the passage indicates a VPN is better.
*   **B: Prayogkarta censorship ra jasusi bata jogina chintit chhan:** While relevant, both VPNs and proxies can offer some level of censorship bypass and privacy, though VPNs are stronger. This doesn't inherently make a proxy *sufficient*.
*   **D: Prayogkarta ko gatividhi lai madhyam dekhi uccha star ko bandwith aawashyak parchha:** VPNs generally provide better bandwidth, so if high bandwidth is a requirement, a proxy wouldn't be enough.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun vakya vpn ra web proksi kaa bare sahi hoinan?,"The correct answer is **D: Vpn le http traffic matra reroute garna sakchha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that VPNs *do not* only reroute HTTP traffic (""Tiniharule http matra nabhaera sabai antarik traficlai punah nirdeshit garchhan"" - They don't just reroute HTTP, but all internet traffic). This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Vpn le web proksi bhanda uccha bandwith dinchha** - The passage states VPNs generally offer higher bandwidth (""Tiniharule sadharantayaha uccha bandwith... pradan garchhan"").
*   **B: Web proksi le sabai web traffic reroute garna sakdaina** - The passage implies this by stating VPNs reroute *all* traffic, while contrasting them with web proxies.
*   **C: Web proksi ko sewa gunastar vpn bhanda kam hunchha** - The passage states VPNs generally offer better service quality (""...ra sewako ajha ramro gunastar pradan garchhan"").



"
Aafno tatkal ko kshetra bhanda bahira ko phone company ko prayog ko anumati kasle dinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Global phone numbers**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...tapainle global number chhuttai kinnu parchha jasle PSTN phoenharulai tapainlai phone garna anumati dinchha."" (You may need to purchase a global number that allows PSTN phones to call you). This directly links global numbers to allowing calls from outside your immediate area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Internet routed calls:** While the passage mentions internet routing, it doesn't say *that* gives permission for calls from outside your area. It's a *method* of making the calls possible, but the permission comes from the number itself.
*   **C: Upagraha (Satellite):** Satellite internet is mentioned as a way to *access* the service, not as a source of permission to receive calls.
*   **D: PSTN phones:** PSTN phones are the *recipients* of the permission, they don't *grant* it.  The global number is what allows them to connect.



"
Anuchhed anusar kehi call prapta garna ke garnu parcha?,"The correct answer is **A: Global number kinnu parchha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Prayaha tapainle global number chhuttai kinnu parchha jasle PSTN phoenharulai tapainlai phone garna anumati dinchha."" (You may need to purchase a global number that allows PSTN phone users to call you.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sthaniya phone company ko prayog garnu parchha** - The passage says you *don't* need to use a local phone company.
* **C: Aafno sthaniya samudaya bata euta number linu parchha** -  The passage states you *don't* need a local number from your community.
* **D: PSTN phone kinnu parchha** -  You need a global number *to receive calls* from PSTN phones, you don't need to buy a PSTN phone itself.



"
Yea madhye kun le italian sabda ko uccharan lai sahi ruple janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Duita r euta r bhanda farak tarikale ucharan garinchha** (Two 'r's are pronounced differently than one 'r').

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically highlights the difference between single 'r' and double 'rr' in Italian pronunciation.** The example of *carro* (dear) and *carro* (chariot) directly illustrates this point.  This is the key to understanding a significant nuance in Italian pronunciation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Praya sabda lekhie jasari ucharan garinchhan** (Most words are pronounced as they are written) - This is a generalization and not entirely true for Italian. Italian pronunciation has many rules and exceptions.
* **C: c ra g bhaeka sabda haru mushkil hunchhan** (Words with 'c' and 'g' are difficult) - While 'c' and 'g' can be tricky due to their different pronunciations depending on the following vowel, the passage *specifically* focuses on the 'r' sound.
* **D: Praaya sabda ko ucharan tyas pachi aaune swor dhwoni anusar bhina huna sakchha** (The pronunciation of most words can vary depending on the following vowel sound) - This is partially true, but again, the *primary* focus of the passage is the 'r' sound.



"
Izmir ko kun viseshata aadhunik samay bhanda aghi utpatti bhaeko ho?,"Correct answer is **D: Rato tile bhaeko chhath**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Thulla bolebhardharu, shishale dhakeka bhawanharu ra adhunik kinmail kendraharu **paramparik rato-tile bhaeka chhatharule bharieka chan**, 18 aun shatabdiko bazar ra purana masjid ra girjagharharu...""

This means the red-tiled roofs are a traditional element that exists alongside modern developments, indicating they originated in earlier times. The other options are clearly modern:

*   **Farakila bolebhard:** Mentioned as a *modern* feature alongside glass buildings and shopping malls.
*   **Agaadi shisha bhaeko bhawan:** Also a modern building type.
*   **Kinmail kendra:** Explicitly stated as ""adhunik kinmail kendra"" (modern shopping malls)."

Hanami sabdale ke ko awalokan janauchha?,"Correct answer is **A: Cherry kaa full**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Hanami bhanera chinine, cherry fuliraheko herne 8 aun shatabdidekhi japani sanskritiko euta bhag rahandai aeko cha"" which translates to ""Hanami is known as cherry blossom viewing and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.""  Therefore, Hanami directly relates to observing cherry blossoms (cherry kaa full).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Japanese kulinta:** While Hanami *started* with the nobility, it's not defined *by* them.
* **C: Aarubakhada kaa full:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Shahi adalat:**  The royal court was involved in early Hanami, but Hanami itself is about the blossoms, not the court.



"
Cherry kaa full awalokan garne pahilo party haru ko aayojana kasle garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Japanese kulin sadasya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Afno ra shahi adalatka any kuleen sadasyaharuka lagi matra japanma pahilo cherry blasm party ayojana garieko thiyo."" This translates to ""Only for themselves and other noble members of the royal court, the first cherry blossom parties were organized in Japan.""  Therefore, it was the Japanese nobility (kulin sadasya) who organized the first parties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: China kaa raja le** - The text states the concept *originated* in China, but not that the Chinese king organized the first parties in Japan.
*   **C: Japan ko raaja** - While the nobility included members of the royal court, the text specifies it was for *themselves and other* noble members, not just the king.
*   **D: Chinese kulin sadasya** - The parties happened *in Japan* and were organized by those in the Japanese court."
Anuchhed anusar jerusalem ko kun paksha le paryatan lai sabai bhanda kam aakarshit garchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahar ko dharmik mahatwa** (The city's religious importance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jerusalem's religious importance and special character due to many sites in the old city area makes it one of Israel's main tourist destinations.""  This directly links tourism to the city's religious significance.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Yo israel ko rajdhani bhaeka le** (Because it is Israel's capital) - While the passage mentions Jerusalem being considered Israel's capital, it doesn't say *that* is what draws tourists. It highlights the disputed nature of that claim.
* **C: Yaska sanskritik viseshata haru** (Its cultural specialties) - The passage mentions cultural aspects, but frames them within the context of religious significance.
* **D: Dherai aitihasik sthal haru** (Many historical sites) - The passage *does* mention historical sites, but states that these sites are prominent *because* of the religious importance.  The religious importance is the primary driver for tourism, and the historical sites are a consequence of that.



"
Yea madhye kun kura anuchhed maa jerusalem ko viseshata ho bhanera ullekh garieko chhaina?,"Correct answer is **B: Rajnitik prabhav**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Rochak itihas (Fascinating history)** - The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem having ""thousands of years of captivating history"".
*   **C: Dharmik mahatwa (Religious importance)** - The passage clearly states Jerusalem is holy to three major religions and a spiritual/religious center.
*   **D: Sanskritik sthal (Cultural site)** - The passage talks about Jerusalem being a cultural center with historical, archaeological, and cultural sites.
*   **B: Rajnitik prabhav (Political influence)** - While the passage acknowledges the international disagreement over Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, it doesn't elaborate on its *political influence* beyond that statement. It focuses more on its historical, religious, and cultural aspects.

Therefore, the passage doesn't specifically highlight the political influence of Jerusalem; it only touches upon the political *dispute* surrounding it."
Anuchhed anusar kasta yatri lai wild card ko kharid le faida puryaudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Dherai bhanda dherai SANParks ghumna chahane yatri lai** (Tourists who want to visit many SANParks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dakshin africa wa tyataka sabai rashtriya nikunjharuko parkharuko chayanma praesh pradan gurney wild card kinna pani yo labhadayak huna sakcha."" This translates to: ""South Africa also provides a 'wild card' for entry into all national parks, which can be beneficial.""

This means the wild card is *most* advantageous for someone planning to visit *multiple* national parks within South Africa, not just Kruger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kruger rashtriya nikunj matra ghumne yatri lai** (Tourists who only visit Kruger National Park) - If you only visit Kruger, the daily conservation and entry fees might be sufficient, and the wild card might not offer significant savings.
* **C: Park kaa shulka bare chintit yatri** (Tourists worried about park fees) - While the wild card addresses fee concerns, it's most useful for frequent visitors, not just those generally concerned about cost.
* **D: Kruger rashtriya nikunj ra arko park ghumne yojana banaeko yatri** (Tourists planning to visit Kruger National Park and another park) -  This is *better* than B and C, but A is still the most accurate. The wild card is beneficial with *multiple* parks, making ""many"" a stronger answer than ""another.""



"
Yea madhye kun vakyale kruger rashtriya nikunj lai sahi rup maa janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo dakshin africa ko sabai bhanda sano rashtriya nikunj ho** (This is the smallest national park in South Africa).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Kruger National Park covers 19,500 km2.** This is a *large* area, not a small one.  The text doesn't mention it being the smallest.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Yo Dakshin africa ko pramukh aakarshan ho** (This is a major attraction of South Africa) - The passage directly states this: ""Dakshin africako mukhya akarshan madhye yo ek ho...""
* **B: Park kaa thuprai ecozone haru ma vibhinna jungli wanyajantu bhetinchhan** (Different wild animals are found in the park's various ecozones) -  The passage says it's divided into 14 different ecological areas, each supporting different wildlife.
* **D: Yaslai wild card kinera ghumna sakinchha** (You can visit it by buying a Wild Card) - The passage mentions the availability of a Wild Card for access to national parks.



"
Yea madhye kun kura le himal ko thado bhag chadhne parvatarohi kaa lagi khatara nimtyauna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bhijeko awastha (Wet condition)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**...jab bhijeko hunchha, yo chhittai khatarnak huna sakcha.**"" ( ...when wet, this can be very dangerous.)

Let's look at why the other options are less directly related to increasing danger:

*   **B: Dhunga ka khutkila (Rocky ground):** The passage mentions the path is mostly rocky, but that's the *norm* for this climb, not specifically a hazard that *increases* danger.
*   **C: Sana gufa (Small cave):** While the cave is described as small and narrow, it's simply an obstacle to *pass through*, not inherently dangerous.
*   **D: Steel ko cable (Steel cable):** The steel cables *provide assistance* (railing), they don't create a hazard.



Therefore, being wet is the condition that makes the climb significantly more dangerous according to the text."
Yea madhye kun wakya le machu pichu himal ko aarohan lai sahi rup ma pratibimbit gardaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Thado bhag haru maa kunai haindrail chainan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Margako adhikansh bhagma dhungako paila rakhieko cha ra bhiralo bhagharuma steel kebalharule sahayak railing pradan garchhan."" (Most of the path has stone steps and steep parts have steel cable railings for support.)  This directly contradicts option B, which claims there are no handrails in the steep sections.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Tandarusta parvatarohi laai pani sas badhna sakchha (Even healthy climbers can experience breathlessness):** The passage mentions ""shwas band hune apeksha hunchha"" (breathlessness is expected).
* **C: Tupa ma gufa bhitra pasnu parchha (You have to pass through a cave on the way):**  The passage says ""Mathiko najik sano gufa cha jun paar garnuparnecha"" (There's a small cave near the top that you have to pass through).
* **D: Bhijeko bela thado bhag khatarapurna hunchha (Steep sections are dangerous when wet):** The passage specifically warns ""jab bhijeko hunchha, yo chhittai khatarnak huna sakcha"" (when wet, it can be very dangerous).



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun majorcan khana ko pramukh hissa hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: Gedagudi (Cheese)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Majorcan cuisine as being based on bread (pauroti), vegetables (sabji), and meat (especially pork - masu). It specifically mentions olive oil, tomatoes, and seasonings, alongside tuna fish and bread. 

Cheese (gedagudi) is **not** mentioned anywhere in the description of Majorcan cuisine provided in the passage.

Therefore, cheese is the major component *not* part of the described Majorcan food.



"
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaeko jankari anusar hangi khana ko bare kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangi le wellington maa upalabhda tato dhunga ko prayog garchha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hangylai pry: paramparagat roast shailiko dinner banauna prayog garinchha. Rotaruaka dherai sthanharule bhu-tapiya hangi prakriya prastawa gardachan bhane any hangi christchurch, wellington ra any thaunma namuna rakhna sakinchha."" This means samples *can be taken* from Wellington, Christchurch etc., but doesn't mean hangi *uses* stones from Wellington. It only suggests stones *could be* sourced from there.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Geothermal hang le khaalto tatauna aago bata tato dhunga ko prayog garchha:** The passage mentions ""khaldolai key tata agobata tato dhungale tatainchha"" which means stones heated by fire (or geothermal heat) are used for cooking.
* **C: Roast dinner praya hangi ko prayog garera pakainchha:** The passage clearly states ""Hangylai pry: paramparagat roast shailiko dinner banauna prayog garinchha"" - hangi is used to cook a roast dinner.
* **D: Geothermal hangi rotarua maa bhetihnchha:** The passage specifically mentions Rotorua: ""Rotaruaka dherai sthanharule bhu-tapiya hangi prakriya prastawa gardachan"" which means geothermal hangi is found in Rotorua.



"
Yea madhye kun tarika hangi ko khaldo laai tataune swabhavik tarika hoina?,"The question asks which method is *not* a natural way to heat the hangi (earth oven). Let's break down the options:

* **A: Gas:** Gas is a modern fuel source, *not* naturally occurring in the earth for hangi cooking.
* **B: Tato dhunga (Hot stones):** Traditionally, hot stones heated in a fire are used to cook the hangi. This is a natural method.
* **C: Geothermal tap:** Geothermal heat (from the earth) is a natural heat source.  Some hangi are cooked using geothermal steam or hot springs.
* **D: Tato dhunga (Hot stones):**  Same as B - a natural method.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Gas**.



"
Yea madhye kun kurale garda bhikshu ra bhikshuni bata visesh manyata paina sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ghuda bhanda mathi samma ko skirt ko pahiran** (Wearing skirts above the knees).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that women *must* wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders, and are offered shawls for modesty. It also mentions a preference for lighter colored skirts to receive a smile from the priest/monk/yogi. This highlights the importance of *modest* attire.  The text implies skirts *above* the knee would *not* be acceptable and therefore would not receive the same recognition from the priest/monk/yogi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chamkilo khada ko pahiran** (Bright colored attire) - While the text mentions a preference for light colors, it doesn’t state that bright colors are *disapproved* of.
*   **B: Kadh dhaknu** (Covering shoulders) - Covering shoulders is *required* for women.
*   **C: Gumba bata khada magnu** (Requesting attire from the monastery) -  The text says shawls are *available* from the monastery; it doesn’t suggest this is something that would hinder recognition.



"
Yea madhye kun kapada gumba maa upalabdha hune sambhavana kam hunchha? ,"The correct answer is **B: Shorts**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states skirts are provided for women, and trousers for men. It also mentions the trousers might not be clean because they aren't washed after each use. The text doesn't mention shorts at all.  While ""khada"" (a type of traditional robe) *could* be available, it's not mentioned in the passage. The passage focuses on skirts and trousers as the main clothing items.

Therefore, shorts are the least likely item to be found in the gumbo (pilgrimage station) based on the provided text.



"
Antartic kshetra ko bhraman maa paryatak lai tara herne awasar kahile prapta huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jado ko mahina maa** (During winter months).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that traveling to arctic and antarctic regions means experiencing polar nights – times when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.  This darkness is ideal for seeing the aurora borealis and enjoying the stars. Winter months provide these long, dark nights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Garmi mahina maa** (During summer months) - Summer brings almost constant daylight, making stargazing impossible.
* **B: Manis kam bhaeko samaya maa** (During times with few people) - While fewer people *can* mean less light pollution, it doesn’t guarantee dark skies for stargazing.
* **D: Jaba prakash ko pradusan kam hunchha** (When light pollution is low) - The passage *mentions* low light pollution as a benefit, but the primary reason for good stargazing is the polar night itself.



"
Kun bela satelite phone mobile ko satta maa prayog garnu wyavaharik hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba sight line ko sateline sanga ko jadan maa badha hunchha** (When there's an obstruction in the line of sight to the satellite).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""kinbhane tapain phone sampark garnaka lagi upagrahako spashta linema bahira baseko hunuparchha"" - which translates to ""because to make a phone call, you need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite.""  This directly indicates satellite phones require an unobstructed view of the satellite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yadi sthan dherai durgam chha** (If the location is very remote) - The passage *starts* by saying satellite phones are useful in remote locations *without* cell coverage.
* **C: Yadi ghar bahira prayog garda** (If used outdoors) - The passage specifically says you need to be *outside* to use a satellite phone.
* **D: Yadi yatra maa kehi visesh data ko awashyakta hunchha** (If there's a specific data requirement during travel) -  The passage mentions data use with satellite phones, but doesn't say it's a limitation.



"
Satelite phone kun awastha maa mobile bhanda upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Dunga ko yatra maa (During mountain trekking)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Durgam sthanharuma, sell phoneko coverage bina, upagraha phone tapainko ek matra vikalpa hoon sakha"" - This translates to ""In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.""
* Mountain trekking (dunga ko yatra) often takes you to remote areas with no cell service.
* The passage also mentions needing a clear line of sight to the satellite, which is more likely in open mountain environments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sahar ghumda (City touring):** Cities generally have excellent cell coverage.
* **C: Jaba durgam data ko awashyakta hudaina (When there is no need for remote data):** Satellite phones *provide* remote data capability, so this is the opposite of when you'd need one.
* **D: Jaba mobile ko coverage hune sambhavana badhi huncha (When the possibility of mobile coverage increases):**  You wouldn't use a satellite phone if mobile coverage is available.



"
Yea madhye kasto dwanda le transnistria republic ko sirjana bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Jatiyata**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Moldova is ""grasit cha"" (affected) by ""jatiya dwandwabata"" (ethnic conflict). It then goes on to explain that this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria republic. While economic and linguistic factors might play a role, the primary driver for Transnistria's formation, as stated in the text, is ethnic conflict.



"
Yea madhye kun kura transnistria ganatantra ko moldova bhanda farak chha?  ,"Correct answer is **C: UN ko manyata**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""transnistria ganatantrama afnai sarkar ra mudra thiyo tar UN sadasya rashtrama manyata prapta chhaina"" which means Transnistria has its own government and currency but doesn't have recognition from UN member states.  Moldova, being a recognized sovereign nation, *does* have UN recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhasa (Language)** - The text says Romanian is the local language in both Chisinau (Moldova) and implies it's also used in Moldova generally, even with Russian influence. It doesn't state a different language in Transnistria.
*   **B: Dharma (Religion)** - The text states Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in *Moldova* but doesn’t mention anything about the religion in Transnistria.
*   **D: Mudra (Currency)** - The text mentions Transnistria *has* its own currency, so this isn’t a difference between the two."
Anuchhed anusar yadi yaatri hawahuri ko awastha baata jogina chahanchhan bhane kun bela montevideo ko bhraman garda upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari golarda ko jado ko mahina (Northern Hemisphere's winter months)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Montevideo bhu dakshinma rahekole, uttari golardhama jadoyam hunda tyahan grishmayam hunchha ra yastai viparit hunchha."" (Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, so when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.)

* **The question asks:** When is it suitable to travel to Montevideo if a traveler wants to avoid hot and humid weather?

Therefore, if someone wants to avoid the heat (+30°C is common), they should travel during the Northern Hemisphere's winter (when it's summer in Montevideo, but likely less intense than the peak summer months).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Montevideo ko sukha season (Montevideo's dry season):** The passage explicitly states there are no distinct ""warsha"" (rainy) or ""sukhkha"" (dry) seasons in Montevideo; rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year.
* **C: Uttari golarda ko garmi ko mahina (Northern Hemisphere's summer months):** This would be winter in Montevideo, which the passage implies would be less desirable for avoiding heat.
* **D: Montevideo ko jado ko mahina (Montevideo's winter months):** The passage says it's summer during the Northern Hemisphere's winter, implying that winter in Montevideo would be the less preferable time for someone wanting to avoid heat.



"
Anuchhed anusar yadi yatri lai jado mausam man parcha bhane montevideo kahile ghumda upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Montevideo maa garmi huda** (When it is summer in Montevideo).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Montevideo bhu dakshinma rahekole, uttari golardhama jadoyam hunda tyahan grishmayam hunchha ra yastai viparit hunchha."" This translates to: ""Because Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.""
* **The question asks:** When is it a good time to visit Montevideo if a traveler prefers warm weather?
* **Therefore:** If a traveler wants warm weather, they should visit Montevideo when it's summer *in Montevideo*, which is when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uttari golarda maa garmi huda** (When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere) - This is the *opposite* of when it's warm in Montevideo.
* **C: Montevideo ko barkha mausam** (Montevodeo's rainy season) - The passage says rainfall is fairly constant throughout the year, with no distinct wet/dry seasons.
* **D: Uttari golarda maa jado huda** (When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere) - This is when Montevideo experiences summer, not when a traveler seeking warmth would visit."
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura le vidhwansa bhanda euta sthaapit graffitti kalakar laai janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Graffitti kala**.

Here's why:

The passage states that established graffiti artists, graffiti programs, and ""legal"" walls exist *in relation* to graffiti.  It then contrasts these with illegal tagging, saying even the illegal tags are sometimes seen *as* artwork. This directly links established graffiti artists to the art form itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Korkar (Work):** While graffiti *is* work, the passage doesn't highlight work as the defining difference.
* **C: Sarvajanik sthan maa anawashyak bhitte chitra (Unnecessary wall paintings in public places):** The passage acknowledges graffiti can be unwanted, but focuses on the *artist* being established.
* **D: Nametine chinha (Signature marks/Tags):**  Tags are presented as the *opposite* of what distinguishes a professional graffiti artist – they are the ""illegal tagging"" being contrasted.

Sangit maghotsaw ko kun paksha sahbhagi haruka lagi anubhav ko abhinna hissa ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthal maa camping garnu (Camping at the location)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kehi utsabharuka lagi, sangeet utsabharuma upasthit dheraile cytema shivir rakhne nirnaya garchhan ra adhikansh upasthitharu yasalai anubhawko ek mahatwapurna hissa manchan.""  This translates to: ""For some festival-goers, it has been decided to have a camping area at the music festival and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.""

Therefore, camping at the location is directly identified as an integral part of the festival experience for many attendees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aafna ketaketi lyaaunu (Bringing your own belongings):** While necessary, it's not specifically highlighted as a key *experience*.
* **C: Aber rat samma sangit maa ramaaunu (Enjoying the music late at night):** This is *part* of the festival, but not highlighted as a core experience *for everyone*. The text only mentions some areas might have late-night music.
* **D: Bihan chadai uthnu (Waking up early):**  This isn't mentioned at all and is unlikely to be a highlight of the festival experience.



"
Anucched anusar mahotsav maa upasthit hune le sangit ko chheu maa camping garne bhae ke kura lai prathamikta dinu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Off-site maa camping garne** (Camping off-site).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tapain karyako najik hoon chahanuhunchha bhane sangitko najik euta camping khetra prapta garna chhittai pugnu parchha.""  This translates to ""If you want to be close to the event, you *must* reach a camping area near the music."" This highlights the importance of finding a camping spot to be near the music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rati jane** (Going late at night) - The passage doesn't mention any priority for going late.  It focuses on *where* you stay.
* **B: Pariwar bhaeko kshetra maa basne** (Staying in the family area) - While family camping areas are mentioned, it's presented as an option *for families*, not a primary consideration for all attendees wanting to be close to the music.
* **D: Bihan chadai uthnu** (Waking up early) -  The passage doesn't focus on wake-up times.



"
Anuchhed anusar aagantuk harule new mexico maa ratri jiwan khojda kun thau bata tadha rahanu parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Casinos**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...लगभग सबै जासो कैसीनोहरुले पेय पदार्थ बेच्दछन् रा तिमिमा धेरै जासोले नाम-ब्रान्ड मनोरञ्जन (प्रथमीक रूपमा विशाल अल्बुकर्क र सान्ता फेको वरिपरिको) प्रदान गर्दछन्।"" This translates to ""...almost all casinos sell drinks and many offer name-brand entertainment (primarily around large Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" 

Therefore, the passage suggests casinos are the place to find nightlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: piyobals (bars)** - While bars are mentioned as potentially problematic for outsiders, they aren't presented as the main source of nightlife. The passage cautions against them.
*   **B: sana bar haru (small bars)** - Similar to option A, small bars are implied to be risky rather than desirable for visitors.
*   **C: Malls (malls)** - The passage mentions malls selling drinks but does *not* present them as nightlife destinations."
Anuchhed anusar agantuk le uttari new mexico maa parichit manoranjan kaha bhetne sambhavana huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Santa fe najik ko casino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mathi suchikrit garieka lagbhag sabaijaso casinoharule payee padartha bechdachhan ra timadhye dheraijasole name-brand manoranjan (prathamik rupma vishal albuquerq ra santa feko waripariko) pradan garchhan.""  This translates to: ""...almost all listed casinos sell drinks and provide a lot of name-brand entertainment (primarily around large Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""

Therefore, casinos near Santa Fe are the most likely place to find familiar entertainment, according to the text.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Albuquerque bata dui ghanta tadha raheko casino:** While the passage mentions casinos, it doesn't specify their distance from Albuquerque.
*   **B: Durgam piyobal:**  The passage warns about the dangers of drinking and driving, not about difficult-to-find bars.
*   **D: Sano bar:** The passage suggests that smaller bars aren't always welcoming to outsiders and implies the larger, casino-related entertainment is more readily available."
Budget bare sachet yatru harule kasto kisimko peya padartha bata tadhai rahanu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: bottle ko pani**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sthaniya tapp pani peon purnataya surakshit cha tar tapain daraunuhunchha bhane botalko pani sajilaisanga bhetna sakinchha."" This translates to ""Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easily available.""

This directly addresses budget travelers needing a safe and affordable drink option.  While tap water is free, bottled water is the alternative if they're concerned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Australian wine:** The text mentions the Australians consider ""sada seto"" coffee strange, not Australian wine being a budget option. It also implies New Zealand and Australian wines are good, but the speaker is *learning* about them, suggesting they might be more expensive.
* **C: Sthaniya bear (local beer):**  The text describes the local beer as ""ramailo ra sfurtidayak"" (fun and refreshing) but doesn't mention its price.
* **D: Fall ko juice (fruit juice):**  The text states ""falaka rus mahango bhae pani utkrishta cha"" (fruit juice is expensive but excellent). This clearly indicates it's *not* a budget option.



"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko kshetra anusar tala die madhye kun peya padartha order garda server jhukkina sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: short black**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""chhoto callo """"espresso"""" ho"" which translates to ""small coffee is """"espresso"""""".  It then explains that a ""short black"" is espresso. The passage indicates the server *knows* what a short black is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Number wann:** This is described as a local beer, and the passage only states it *is* a local beer, not that a server would readily serve it.
* **C: New zealand ko sauvignon blanc:** The passage says the server is *learning* about New Zealand wines and might not be an expert.
* **D: Sada seto:** This is described as a coffee order that Australians consider foreign, implying the server might not be familiar with it.



"
Tin satabdi sanga raheko upaniwesh ko awadhi kun samuha le suru gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Spainyharule aupaniweshikaran suru gare june teen shatabdisamma rahyo."" This directly translates to ""The Spanish started colonization for three centuries.""

Therefore, the Spanish initiated the three-century colonial period. While the other groups (Payaguá, Guaycurú, Guaraní) were indigenous people living in the region *during* that time, they didn't *begin* the colonization.



"
Anuchhed anusar euta parisian lai najik lyaaune sabai bhandha ramro tarika ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Binamra bannu (To be humble)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...*jastai """"bean elebhe"""" (ramrosanga lyaieko) co jasto wyawahar gardai paris jaane uttam tarika bhaneko tapainko uttam wyawahar hunu ho.*"" This translates to: ""...the best way to interact with Parisians is to behave politely and respectfully (like someone who is well-mannered).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Parisian drishtikon anukaran garnu (To imitate Parisian perspective):** The passage doesn't say to *imitate* their perspective, but rather to behave politely *towards* them.
*   **B: Atmavishwas dekhaunu (To show confidence):** The passage actually implies the opposite – that Parisians are perceived as arrogant and proud, and good manners are a contrast to that.
*   **D: Bahirmukhi wyawahar dekhaunu (To show extroverted behavior):** While not explicitly stated as *bad*, the passage focuses on politeness and humility, not necessarily extroversion.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun gun paramparagat rup maa parisian ko ho bhanera manidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ahankar (Ego/Arrogance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Perisabasiharulai ahankari, asabhya ra ghamandi bhaekoma garba cha."" (Persians are proud, behaving arrogantly, rudely and with conceit).  This directly identifies arrogance/ego as a trait traditionally associated with Persians *according to the passage's viewpoint*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: asabhya (Rude/Impolite):** While mentioned, it's listed *alongside* arrogance, not presented as the central traditional trait.
*   **C: Chanchalta (Restlessness/Fickleness):** This isn't mentioned at all in the passage.
*   **D: Aakasmikta (Suddenness/Abruptness):** The passage talks about Persians being ""afain pagline chan"" (suddenly going crazy/upset) *as a reaction* to politeness, not as a core traditional trait *of* Persians.



Therefore, **Ahankar (Ego/Arrogance)** is the most accurate answer based on the text provided."
Cape town ko metroRail ko pratham shreni ko faida ke ho?,"Correct answer is **A: Rail ko dabba agadi patti hunchha**

Here's why:

*   The text states ""Metroplus badhi aramdayi ra come bhidbhad hunchha"" which translates to ""Metroplus is more comfortable and less crowded."" This directly implies a better experience, and a ""rail ko dabba agadi patti hunchha"" (the rail compartment is in the front) relates to comfort and less crowding as the first class section is often at the front.
*   **B: Kam manis** (Less people) - While Metroplus *is* less crowded, that's a *result* of it being first class, not the primary benefit.
*   **C: Tesro shreni ko ticket bhanda sasto** (Cheaper than third class ticket) - The text says it's cheaper than *European* metro tickets, not cheaper than third class in Cape Town.
*   **D: Metro ticket to mulya jatikai** (Metro ticket is the same price) - The text explicitly states Metroplus is *more expensive*.

Therefore, the primary benefit of Cape Town's metro rail first class (Metroplus) as described in the text is the more comfortable and spacious experience, which is tied to being in the front of the train."
Anunchhed anusar cape town ko pratyek yatru rail maa ke hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Pahilo ra tesro dubai shreni kaa dabba** (First and third class compartments).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Cape town ra warpar yatruwahak railharuma metrorelka dui warga chan: metroplus (first class bhanine) ra metro (third class bhanine)."" This translates to: ""Cape Town and surrounding passenger trains have two classes of metro rail: MetroPlus (considered first class) and Metro (considered third class).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kam bhid bhaeko metro ko dabba** (Less crowded metro compartment) - While MetroPlus is less crowded, the passage doesn't say *every* compartment is less crowded.
* **B: Dubai shreni ko ticket ko mulya saman** (Same price as Dubai class tickets) - The passage only mentions that MetroPlus is cheaper than a typical European metro ticket; it doesn't compare it to Dubai.
* **C: Tin farak shreni** (Three different classes) - The passage only mentions two classes: MetroPlus and Metro.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that each train has compartments representing first (MetroPlus) and third (Metro) class travel."
Yea maddhye kun ek jaivik kitanu le garna sakne sambhavana kam hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dabar banaune** (Causing poison).

Here's why:

The passage states that animals encountered by travelers can cause food spoilage, inflammation, allergic reactions, spread infections, and inflict injuries (even fatal ones). It *also* states that not all harmful animals are parasitic.  This implies that some harmful effects come from things *other* than parasitism – like venom/poison.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Alergy nimtyaune (Causing allergies):** The passage specifically mentions allergies as a potential harm.
* **C: Sankraman failaune (Spreading infections):** The passage specifically mentions infections as a potential harm.
* **D: Baliyo chot nimtyaune (Causing severe injuries):** The passage specifically mentions injuries, including potentially fatal ones, as a potential harm.

Therefore, ""causing poison"" is the one effect the passage implies is *not* necessarily linked to being a parasite.  A venomous snake, for example, causes harm through poison, not by living *on* the traveler.



"
Prepaid phone card kaha kinna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuna kaa dokaan haru maa** (In every store).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bhuktani phone wa sadharan telefonharubata prayog garna sakine prepaid store phone cardharuko bhramak kramale **harek kunako store bharieko hunchha**.""  This directly translates to ""Prepaid store phone cards that can be used with landlines or mobile phones are filled in **every store** in a confusing manner.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wisesh mulukharumaa** (In specific countries): The text doesn't limit the cards to specific countries, it says *every* store.
*   **B: Train station maa** (At train stations): The text doesn't mention train stations.
*   **D: Pay phone maa** (At pay phones):  The text focuses on *buying* the cards, not using them *at* pay phones.



"
Kehi card haru le dine ramro call rate kasari upbhog garna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yaslai wisesh muluk maa matra upabhog garna sakinchha** (It can only be used in specific countries).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Kehi deshharuka wishishta samuhaharulai sasto call darr pradan garnama mahira bhae pani sabai card kahinpani call garna uchit chan."" This translates to ""Even though some cards are better at providing cheaper call rates to specific countries, all cards should be able to make calls."" This implies that the cheaper rates are *limited* to certain countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Toll-free number dwara:** The passage mentions toll-free numbers for *accessing the service* (reaching them), not for using the card's benefits.
* **C: Kuna ko store maa:** The passage refers to stores as places to *buy* the cards, not where the rate benefits apply.
* **D: Pay phone ko prayog garera ra thap shulka tirera:**  This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun rukh Plitbhais tall raashtriya nikunja maa tyati paaidaina?","The passage states Plitbhais Tall National Park is characterized by a variety of trees, including a mix of alpine and temperate vegetation. It doesn't *list* specific tree types found there. However, it emphasizes the *mixture* of alpine and temperate trees.

The question asks which tree is *least likely* to be found. Without a list of trees present, we must rely on general knowledge.

*   **Beech:** Beech trees are temperate forest trees and would fit the description of the park’s vegetation.
*   **Katus (Birch):** Birch trees are found in both temperate and colder (alpine) regions.
*   **Devdar (Deodar/Cedar):** Deodar are typically found in the Himalayan region, fitting the alpine description.
*   **Spruce:** Spruce trees are coniferous trees often associated with colder climates and alpine forests.

Given this, none of the trees are explicitly stated as *not* being present. However, the description focuses on a *mix* of alpine and temperate. Considering general tree distributions, **Beech** is the most likely to be less prevalent in a park described as having significant alpine elements.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Beech**.



"
Yi madhye kun durlabh jivjantu Plitbhais tall rashtriya nikunj maa bhetinchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: capercelli**.

The text (P) specifically mentions ""capercelli"" as one of the rare animals found in Plitbhais tall rashtriya nikunj (Plitvice Lakes National Park).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Turkey** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Honey Badger** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Cassowary** - Not mentioned in the text.



"
Anuchhed anusar kshetra code le ke maa sahayata garchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Gairkanuni pratilipi (Illegal copies)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that field codes have *no effect* on illegal copies (""awaidh pratilipimathi kunai pani prabhawa hundaina"").  The point is made that copies will play regardless of the field code. The passage is arguing against the claim that these codes are used to stop piracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Disk ko pratilipi (Disk copy):** While related to the topic, the field code doesn’t *help* with disk copying; it doesn't prevent it.
*   **B: Bazar niyantran (Market control):** The passage *claims* the real purpose is market control, but it doesn't say the field code *helps* with that. It's the *goal*, not the function of the code.
*   **C: Piracy rokna (Stopping piracy):** The passage explicitly states the companies are *lying* about this being the purpose.



"
Anuchhed anusar media compay haru le kshetra code ko bare maa kun juth failauchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Tin le viralai piracy lai rokchhan.**

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Media companyharule yo """"piracy rokna"""" bhane davi gardai..."" (Media companies claim to be stopping piracy...). The passage then argues this claim is a lie (""jhuto bolchhan""). Therefore, the media companies are falsely claiming they are stopping piracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ti bazar niyantran garna aawashyak chhan** (They are necessary to control the market) - While the passage implies control is the *real* goal, it doesn't state they *need* to control the market.
* **B: Tin le gairkanuni pratilipi bata jogauchhan** (They benefit from illegal copies) - The passage doesn't state they benefit from illegal copies, but rather the claim to stop them is false.
* **C: Ti paisa kamauna sahayog garchhan** (They help make money) - The passage describes it as a ""paisako chakrabare"" (money cycle), suggesting profit *is* the motive, but it doesn't say they *help* others make money.



"
Aafno grihabhumi aauda kun prakriya anaupacharik hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhansar niyantran** (Customs control).

Here's why:

The original statement (P) specifically mentions that customs control can be inconvenient when entering one's homeland. The question (Q) asks what process is often informal.  Customs control is frequently the process that feels less formal, involving declarations and potential inspections. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adhyagaman janch (Immigration check):**  While it *can* be quick, immigration checks are generally quite formal and procedural.
* **B: Saman ko ghosana (Declaration of goods):** This is *part* of customs control and is a formal process itself.
* **C: Saman ko kanuni sima (Legal limit of goods):** This is a *rule* relating to customs, not a process.



"
Grihabhumi aaunu aghi kun kura thaha paunu jaruri hunchha?,"The most relevant answer is **B: Yadi tapaile kaanuni sima ko lagi aafno saman ko ghosana garnu parchha bhanne bare (If you need to declare your belongings for legal limits).**

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P) explicitly mentions needing to be aware of what you can bring and declare within legal limits.**  The whole point is to avoid issues with customs control.
* **Option A** (Adhyagaman janch kendra chha bhanera - If there is an immigration check center) is relevant but not the *core* issue the prompt addresses.
* **Option C** (tyahaa bhansar niyantran chha bare - If there is customs control there) is stated in the prompt itself - you already *know* there's customs control.  You need to know what to *do* about it.
* **Option D** (tapaile lyaeko kunai saman ko anumati chhaina bare - If you don't have permission for any of the items you are bringing) is a consequence of *not* knowing the rules, not a thing you need to find out *before* arriving.



Therefore, **B** directly addresses the information the prompt emphasizes you need to be aware of."
Anuchhed anusar kun kura prachur matra maa huda parwatarohi le lagatar cochamo upatyaka bhitra naya marga patta lagauchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Drishya (Views/Scenery)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chulima pugnule shikharbata dekhine mann lobhyaune drishyaharu samawesh gardacha."" (Reaching the summit, captivating views are included).  It then goes on to say that climbers are *constantly establishing new routes* (""nirantar naya margharu sthapana gardaichhan"") *within* those possibilities opened up by the scenery.

The climbers are motivated by the beautiful views and the potential for new routes *because* of the captivating scenery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shikhar (Summit):** While reaching the summit is mentioned, it doesn’t explain *why* they are continually finding new routes.
*   **C: Chuchuro (Peaks):** Similar to summit, peaks are a feature, not the driving force for exploration.
*   **D: Bhitta (Walls):** The walls (granite cliffs) are a characteristic of the valley, but the views *from* those walls, and the overall landscape, are what inspire new climbs.



"
Anuchhed maa dieko jankaari anusar dakshini golarda maa kasle dherai warpaar lagaauchha?,"The correct answer is **D: LATAM Oneworld**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...June LATAM wonworld udan ho."" This indicates that LATAM Oneworld offers a flight that covers a significant portion of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. The passage also highlights it as the *only* option for that specific route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam:** The passage explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't fly over all three oceans in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   **B: Star Alliance:** While Star Alliance covers a good portion, it doesn’t include Tahiti.
*   **C: South Pacific:** The South Pacific is a *region*, not an airline or alliance.



"
Kun vimaan gathabandhan le dakshini golarda maa sabai bhanda kam mahasagar ko waripaari lagauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Alliance has everything except Tahiti from Santiago, Chile to the eastern South Pacific, June LATAM Oneworld flight is.""  This means Star Alliance covers a significant portion of the Southern Hemisphere's oceans, only missing the route to Tahiti. The other options are stated as *not* covering all three oceans (SkyTeam) or are specific airlines/alliances related to a single route (LATAM Oneworld, South Pacific isn't mentioned as a major alliance in the text).



"
Kun tour sanstha Global Running Tours ko uttaradhikari ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The text states: ""Global running tourseko uttaradhikari, **Go Running Tours** sele char mahadwipma darjanaun citerning pradayakharulai sanjalma joddachha."" (The successor of Global Running Tours, **Go Running Tours**, connects providers of sightseeing tours on four continents.)



"
Anuchhed anusar go running tour le kati wata drishya awalokan sanstha laai jodchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Darjanau**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...go running toursele char mahadwipma darjanaun citerning pradayakharulai sanjalma joddachha."" This translates to ""...Go Running Tours connects dozens of sightseeing providers across four continents.""  ""Darjanau"" means dozens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Char (Four):** While the tours span four continents, the question asks about the *number of providers* connected, not the number of continents.
*   **B: 200:** The text mentions 200 travel organizations total, but not specifically how many Go Running Tours connects.
*   **D: Tin (Three):**  This number is not mentioned in the text.



"
Chituwa ko spasta awalokan garna chahane paryatak le ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Durbin ko prayog garnu parchha** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sinha, cheeta ra chituwa kahilekanhi lajaunchhan ra tapain durbinbata herera tinlai ajha ramrari dekhnu hune cha."" This translates to ""Lions, cheetahs and leopards are shy and you will have a better view of them by looking through binoculars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Safari paidal yatra maa janu parchha** (Go on a walking safari) - While walking safaris are mentioned, the text specifically says binoculars are needed for a *better* view of the leopard.
* **B: Jhadi ko paidal yatra maa janu parchha** (Go on a bush walk) -  A bush walk is a type of safari, but doesn't guarantee a clear view of a leopard.
* **D: Gadi liera standard upakaran ko prayog garnu parchha** (Use standard equipment with a car) - The text doesn't mention needing a car or standard equipment for seeing leopards; it focuses on binoculars.



"
Anuchhed anusar aagantuk le gadi maa sawari garda kasto kisim ko janawar bhetna sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **B: jiraf**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*hattiharu ra jirafharu, car ra stariya upkaranka najik jaan ruchaunchhan ramro drishya herne mauka dinechha.*"" This translates to ""...elephants and giraffes, close to cars and stationary equipment offer a good opportunity to see.""

While lions, cheetahs, and leopards are mentioned, the passage specifically says giraffes are seen *near cars*. The question asks about animals seen *while riding in a vehicle*.

Therefore, the answer is **B: jiraf**.



"
Anuchhed anusar ke garna le bhraman ko kharchha ghatchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Eklai jada** (Going alone).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yatraharu thulla samuhama sasto hunchhan, tyasaile tapain ekjana matra hunuhunchha wa ekjana matra sathisanga hunuhunchha bhane, ramro prati-wyakti mulyaka lagi any manisharusanga bhetera chardekhi cha janako samuha nirman gurney prayas garnuhos."" 

This translates to: ""Travel is cheaper in larger groups, therefore if you are alone or with only one companion, try to find other people to form a group for a better per-person price.""

This directly implies that traveling alone results in higher costs, as you need to seek out others to share expenses and achieve a lower per-person price. The passage is suggesting finding others *to avoid* the higher costs of solo travel. Therefore, going alone increases the cost.



"
Anuchhed anusar bhraman ko ramro dar kasle haat parne sambhavana badhi hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Sangai yatra garne dui sathi haru** (Traveling with two companions).

Here's why:

The passage states that travel is cheaper in larger groups. However, if you are traveling alone or with just one companion, it suggests looking for others to form a group for better per-person value.  The passage specifically contrasts being alone/with one person *versus* forming a group. Option C - two companions - is the closest to forming a small group for better value as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gadi ferbadal garna manne paryatak haru** (Tourists willing to share a ride) - While sharing rides could reduce costs, the passage doesn't focus on this.
*   **B: Tin janako samuha** (A group of three people) - While a group, the passage specifically focuses on *needing* to form a group if you start with one or two people.
*   **D: Panch jana ko samuha** (A group of five people) - The passage doesn't highlight a specific ideal group size, just that larger groups are cheaper. The point is about *forming* a group, not necessarily what the best size is.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sangeet, chalchitra, sahitya ra lokpriya sanskritima barambar chitrit garine hunale yo sahar ra yahan raheka pramukh sthalharu vishwabhar chinin maddat mileko cha."" This translates to: ""The frequent depiction of music, cinema, literature, and popular culture has helped to make this city and its prominent locations known throughout the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uccha star ko adhiweshan suwidha** (High-level convention facilities): While mentioned as a feature contributing to tourism, it's not the *reason* for San Francisco's global fame.
* **C: Aarthik vividhata** (Economic diversity): The passage mentions economic diversity, but it's presented as a characteristic *of* San Francisco, not the primary driver of its world recognition.
* **D: Udaudo asian khana ko paridrishya** (Presence of diverse Asian cuisine):  Asian cuisine is mentioned as making San Francisco a great place to eat, but not as the reason it's globally famous.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye san francisco bare kun vakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Arthatantra purai paryatan maa nirbhar chha** (The economy is completely dependent on tourism).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sabai bhanda thulo rozgar kshetraharu wyawasayik sewa, sarkar, witta, wyapar ra paryatan hun."" (The largest employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism).  This means tourism is *one* of the major sectors, but not the *sole* one. The economy is diversified.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Yo chalchitra ra kitab harumaa dherai chitrit bhaeko chha** (It is heavily featured in films and books) - The passage explicitly says ""Sangeet, chalchitra, sahitya ra lokpriya sanskritima barambar chitrit garine hunale yo sahar..."" (Its frequent depiction in music, film, literature and popular culture has helped this city...)
* **B: Asian cuisine prachalit chha** (Asian cuisine is popular) - The passage mentions ""Any asealy kujin: koreali, thai, bharatiya ra japanika lagi saan francisco utkrishta thaunharumadhye ek ho"" (San Francisco is one of the best places for various Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese).
* **C: Tyaha dherai hotel ra adhiveshan kendra haru chhan** (There are many hotels and convention centers there) - The passage states ""Saan franciscole asankhya bhojanalaya, restaurant ra shirsha sammelan suwidha sath ek vishal paryatan purwadhar vikas gareko cha."" (San Francisco has developed a huge tourism infrastructure with numerous restaurants, eateries and conference facilities).



"
Anuchhed anusar travel agent ko sewa kasto kisim ko yatru laai faidajanak hunechha?,"The correct answer is **D: Package deal maa booking garna man paraune yatru (Travelers who prefer booking in package deals)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel agents typically offer packages including breakfast, transportation, and flight/hotel combinations. It also says they can handle reservations and modifications needed during the trip. This is most beneficial for someone who *prefers* booking everything together in a package deal rather than arranging things independently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nirnaya garna nasakekaa yatru (Undecided travelers):** While an agent *could* help someone undecided, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary benefit.
*   **B: Aakasmikta man paraune yatru (Travelers prone to emergencies):** The passage doesn't specifically focus on handling emergencies.
*   **C: Bhisa surakshit nabhaeko yatru (Travelers without secure visas):** The passage mentions agents can *help* with visa arrangements, but it’s not the core service.



"
Yea madhye kun kura travel agent ko faida kaa rup maa anuchhed maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Druta rup maa tayar garieka yatra kaa kagajat haru (Quickly prepared travel documents)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on what travel agents *do* provide:** hotel deals (B), inclusive packages (C), and reservation services (D). It explicitly mentions they have agreements with hotels, offer packages including meals and transport, and can handle reservations including visas.
* **The passage *does not* mention travel agents offering to quickly prepare travel documents.** While they might facilitate the process, the focus is on booking and arrangements, not the speed of document preparation.

Therefore, option A is the only one that isn't a benefit or service outlined in the text regarding travel agents.

Anuchhed anusar wastawik samayamaa paath anuwaad garne app ke garna sakdainan?,"The correct answer is **D: Harek palta 100 pratishat sahi anuwad (100% accurate translation every time)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anuwad injinharu natakiya rupma sudhar bhaeka chan, ra ahile prayaha badhi wa come sahi anuwadharu dinchhan (ra ajha wirlai aspashta), tar kehi herchah ajhai baaki cha, kinky tiniharule ajhai pani yo sabai galat bujheka hoon sakdachhan."" 

This translates to: ""Translation engines have improved dramatically, and now provide fairly accurate translations (and still sometimes unclear), but there is still work to be done, because they can still misunderstand everything.""

This clearly indicates that even the best apps *cannot* guarantee 100% accurate translations *every* time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Videshi bhasamaa sanket ko anuwad (Translating signals in a foreign language):** The passage explicitly states some apps *can* translate signals from the real world in foreign languages.
* **B: Path ko sabai khanda ko anuwad (Translating all parts of the text):** The passage defines the app as being able to translate complete blocks of text.
* **C: Smartphone dwara path lai wastu maa anuwad (Translating text through a smartphone):** The passage mentions the apps are used on smartphones.



"
Offline maa anuaad garna ke le anumati dinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhasa ko data ko download**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""google anuwad ho, jasle **iccha gareko bhashako deta download garepachhi** offline anuwad gurney anumati dinchha."" This directly translates to ""Google Translate, which allows offline translation **after downloading the data for the desired language**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sudharieko anuwad engine (Improved translation engine)** - While a better engine is *helpful*, it doesn't enable offline translation. You still need the language data.
* **B: Smartphones** - Smartphones are the *device* used, but they don't provide the ability to translate offline.
* **D: Wastawik samay ko anuwad shreni ka applications (Real-time translation class of applications)** - This is a general description of the app type, not what specifically allows offline use.



"
Yea madhye kun himpahiro ko trigger hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: Gham ko kiran** (Sun's rays).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kahilekanhi mull trigger gurney ghatana **surya taple hiunlai tataunu ho**..."" This translates to ""Sometimes the main triggering event is the sun melting the snow...""  Therefore, sun's rays *are* a trigger for avalanches (himm pahiro).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tasine hiun** (Frozen snow) - The passage states snow needs to be *melted*, not frozen, to trigger an avalanche.
*   **B: Manis** (Humans) - The passage explicitly mentions humans can *cause* avalanches (""prayaha manawaharu hun"" - sometimes humans).
*   **D: Thap himpat** (Heavy snowfall) - The passage also lists heavy snowfall as a potential trigger (""kahilekaahin adhik himpat"").

Therefore, the only option that is *not* mentioned as a trigger in the text is the sun's rays.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye himpahiro ko rupmaa ke jharchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Thado bhiralo maa dherai hiun ko matra** (A large amount of snow on a sloping ground).

Here's why:

The passage states that avalanches (himm pahiro) happen when there's *a lot* of snow (dherai come) on a slope (bhiralo). It emphasizes that a large accumulation of snow is necessary, and then a trigger is needed to release it.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Trigger nagarieko tasine hiun** (Snow that isn't triggered) - The passage says a trigger *is* needed, so this is incorrect.
* **B: Hiun nabhaeko thado bhiralo** (A sloping ground without snow) -  The passage explicitly states snow is required.
* **D: Manis le nachalaeko hiun** (Snow not moved by humans) - While humans can *be* a trigger, the passage mentions natural triggers too (sun, more snowfall, other natural events). The amount of snow is the primary factor, not whether humans are involved.



"
Anuchhed anusar tarkari kun samagri maa adharit hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jadibuti ra masala**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Masu wa sagasabjiharu pani hune jadibuti ra masalama adharit khana tarkari ho."" This translates to ""Vegetables are food based on herbs and spices.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dahi ra pani (Yogurt and water)** - While yogurt (dahi) is mentioned as used in North India, it's not the *base* of the vegetable dish.
*   **C: Nariwal ko dudh ra aasu (Coconut milk and tears)** - Coconut milk is mentioned as used in South India, but ""aasu"" (tears) is not mentioned in the text. It’s also not the base.
*   **D: Sabji ra dudh (Vegetables and milk)** - While vegetables *are* in the dish, the text specifically states it's *based on* herbs and spices, not just vegetables and milk.



"
Kehi kshetra harumaa nariwal ko dudh kehi tarkari maa ke ko satta maa prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sabji** (Vegetables).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nariwalko dudhko prayog samanyataya dakshini bharat ra upa kehi any tatawarti kshetraharuma **tarkari** maa garinchha.""  This translates to ""Coconut milk is commonly used in vegetables in South India and some other coastal areas.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masu** (Meat) - The passage doesn't mention coconut milk being used with meat.
*   **C: Dahi** (Yogurt) - The passage says yogurt is used in North India and Pakistan.
*   **D: Masala** (Spice) - While spices are used in the dishes, the passage specifically mentions coconut milk being used *in* the vegetables.



"
Pathar pugna kina Transantarctic himal ko warapara ko ghumauro aawashyak chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Visesh tractor charito hudainan** (Special tractors are not available).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""yo kewal vishesh triactorharu, hiunma ghisarne gadiharudwara indhan ra apurtika sath yatra garna sakinchha."" (This can only be traveled by special tractors, with fuel and supplies carried by vehicles that can withstand the ice).  Then it continues saying ""Yiniharu dherai chharito chhainan..."" (They are not readily available...). This directly implies a lack of available specialized tractors is the reason for the difficult journey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mcmurdo station praya banda hunchha (McMurdo Station is often closed):** The passage doesn't mention McMurdo Station being closed. It's a starting point.
* **B: Sankuchit hiun khatarapurna hunchha (It's narrow and dangerous):** While the journey is likely dangerous, the passage doesn't focus on it being narrow. The difficulty is related to the resources needed.
* **D: Ross samudra bata bhanda yatra garna sajilo hunchha (Traveling from the Ross Sea is easier):** The passage doesn't compare traveling from the Ross Sea. It focuses on the overland route.



"
Dakshini dhrubha tira ke maa jhanda ko chinha lagaieko hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Hiunle bhariekaa darar** (Filled cracks).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yo dararharule bharieko ra jhandadwara chihna lagaieko thos garieko hiun ho."" (These filled cracks are made of concrete and marked with flags.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mcmurdo station ko bato (McMurdo Station road):** While McMurdo Station is mentioned, the passage specifically says flags mark the *cracks*, not the road.
* **B: Indhan tanne tractor (Fuel carrying tractors):** Tractors are *using* the route, they aren't what's marked with flags.
* **D: Himalko warapara kaa khatarapurna ghumauro (Dangerous journey across the mountains):** This describes the overall trip, but not what is specifically flagged.



"
Dakshini africa ko bhraman garda paryatak le dhyan dinu parne kun kura anuchhed maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"Correct answer is **C: Dakshini africa kaa praya sabai chimeki desh haru sthir chhan**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Dakshin africa sthira bhaepani sabai chhimeki deshharu sthira chhainan**"" which translates to ""Even if South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are stable."" This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: vibhinna muluk ko bhisa sambandhi farak aawashyakata chhan** - The passage mentions ""Rashtra-rashtrama bhisa awashyakta ra lagatharu farak-farak hunchhan"" (International visa requirements and costs vary).
*   **B: Mul marga bhanda bahira kaa bato maa ghumna gadi ko prayog thik hunchha** - The passage advocates for overland travel and specifically recommends 4x4 vehicles for reaching remote areas: ""Dakshini africama kardwara praesh garnu sampurna kshetrako sundarta hernka sathai samanya paryatan margharuko sthanma pugnaka lagi ek uttam tarika ho...4x4lai atyadhik salah diinchha.""
*   **D: Gadi maa ghumda 4x4 ko sifaris garinchha** - As explained above, the passage strongly recommends 4x4 vehicles.



"
Anuchhed anusar gadi maa dakshini africa ghumne paryatak kaa lagi kun sallaha kharab ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Kanun anusar gadi maa kehi aakasmik wastuharu upalabdha rahanu parchha** (According to the law, certain emergency supplies must be available in the vehicle).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Pratyek deshsanga gadima coon apatkalin wastuharu hunuparchha bhane awashyaktaka lagi adwitiya kanunharu chan"" - which translates to ""Each country requires certain emergency supplies in the vehicle, and there are unique laws regarding requirements."" This directly addresses a potential hardship for tourists - the need to comply with specific and varying legal requirements for emergency supplies in each country they travel through.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 4x4 ko sifaris garie pani praya sthan haru samanya gadi bata puginchha** (Even though 4x4 is recommended, many places can be reached by a regular car) - The passage actually emphasizes the *need* for 4x4 for many locations, not that they are easily accessible by regular cars.
* **C: Samanya marga haru bata vichalit huna khojne kaa lagi gadi upayukta ho** (The vehicle is suitable for deviating from normal roads to find places) - While true to some extent, the passage focuses on the challenges of traveling in the region, not the benefit of off-road exploration.
* **D: Dakshini africa kaa sabai chimeki muluk haru ghumna kaa lagi aadarsha chainan** (Not all neighboring countries of South Africa are ideal for tourism) -  This is stated in the passage, but is a general observation about the political stability of the region, not a specific hardship *caused by the requirements for a vehicle*.



"
Yea madhye kun kura aafno jhola tetikai chodda hune jokhim kaa rupmaa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Tapai lai arko manis samjhana sakinchha (Someone might mistake you for someone else)**.

Here's why:

The passage details risks like:

*   **A: Ti chori huna sakchhan (Your bag could be stolen):**  ""...bewarise chhadieka jholaharu chorko nishanama parna sakchhan..."" (unattended bags can become targets for thieves)
*   **B: Tapai le tathapai lagu aushadh bokna saknu hunchha (You might unknowingly carry drugs):** ""...thaha nabhaikan lago aushadh wahakko rupma prayog garieko pauna saknuhunchha..."" (you could be used to transport drugs unknowingly)
*   **D: Adhikari harule tinlai sabhaavit bomb ko jokhim kaa rupmaa herna sakchhan (Officials might see you as a potential bomb threat):** ""...bamko chunautibata sawadhan rahane adhikariharuko dhyan pani khichna sakdachhan."" (drawing the attention of officials who are vigilant about bombs)

However, the passage **does not mention** the risk of someone mistaking you for another person. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
Lagu ausadh ko dhuwani bare anuchhed maa ke kura ullekh bhaeko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Yadi tapaile lagu ausadh nabokeko bhae pani adhikariharule tapaiko jhola jafat garna sakchhan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions that unattended bags can attract the attention of officials and be searched, even if you haven't knowingly done anything wrong (""Bewarise chhadieka jholaharu chorko nishanama parna sakchhan ra yasta jholale bamko chunautibata sawadhan rahane adhikariharuko dhyan pani khichna sakdachhan."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage *does* mention severe penalties including the death penalty in some countries, it's not the central focus of the warning about drug use.
*   **B:**  The passage warns about being cautious while traveling internationally, but that's a broader point, not the specific detail about drug-sniffing dogs or bag searches.
*   **C:** The passage states drug-sniffing dogs *can* be used without your knowledge, but it doesn't say this *will* happen. It's a potential risk mentioned along with other dangers.



"
Sthagan maa basta kun prakar ko peya padarha gharmaa banaunu hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Juice**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yadi tapain adhik sahasi mahasus gardai hunuhunchha bhane, yo awasarlai **juice** banauna wa kehi smudiharu blend garna prayog garnuhos."" (If you are feeling more adventurous, try making juice or blending some smoothies.)

This indicates juice is something you can *make* at home when staying indoors. The other options are presented as things you might *get* from neighbors or pubs (beer) or are already prepared (coffee, chia).
"
Yadi tapaiko sahar piune sanskriti ko lagi lokpriya chha bhane tapaile sthagan maa raheko bela ke ko bhraman garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Juice waa smoothie kaa dokan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadi tapain adhik sahasi mahasus gardai hunuhunchha bhane, yo awasarlai juice banauna wa kehi smudiharu blend garna prayog garnuhos."" (If you are feeling more adventurous, try making juice or blending some smoothies.)

This directly links adventurousness (and therefore exploring options) with juice and smoothie shops when you are out. The passage also mentions ""vividh payee sanskriti"" (diverse drink culture) and suggests exploring options beyond your usual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aafno chimek bahira rahekaa kafi kaa dokan** (A coffee shop outside your neighborhood) - The passage doesn't specifically suggest going *outside* your neighborhood for coffee, and it's more focused on exploring different *types* of drinks.
* **C: Tapaile praya najane pub** (A pub you don't usually go to) - While exploring is mentioned, the passage doesn’t mention pubs specifically.
* **D: Chamomile chia banaune restaurant** (A restaurant that makes chamomile chia) - Chamomile chia is mentioned as something to make *at home* for relaxation, not as a place to visit.



"
Dhukur ko murti kaha chhan?,"The correct answer is **B: Church ko chihan maa** (On the sign of the church).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Girjagharko chheuchhauma raheka kehi chihanharuma marblebata baneka dhukurharuko rochak pratimaharu chan.""  This translates to ""There are interesting statues of clouds made of marble on the sign of the church.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gau bhanda aadhi ghanta tadha** (Half an hour to see the village) - This refers to how long it takes to see the village, not where the statues are.
*   **C: Eysturoy ko tapu maa** (On the island of Eysturoy) - This is the location of the village, but not the specific location of the statues.
*   **D: Church bhitra** (Inside the church) - The passage specifically says the statues are *on the sign of the church* (chheuchhauma), not inside.



"
Kun kisim ko bhisama paryapta aarthik sahayog dekhanaunu aawashyak parna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **D: vidyarthi bhisa (Student Visa)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dherai deshharuka lagi, tapaile adhyayan garna chaheko sansthabata prastawa patrako awashyakta pardachha ra tapainko courseko kamtima pahilo warshaka lagi afainlai sahayog garna kharcha rakamko praman pani chahinchha.""  This translates to: ""For many countries, you need a letter of acceptance from the institution you want to study at, and proof of funds to cover expenses for at least the first year of your course.""

This clearly indicates that a student visa requires proof of financial support.  The other visas mentioned – tourist, business, and temporary – don't typically have the same level of financial scrutiny.



"
wistrit bhisa kaslai sabai bhadna badhi awashyak huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Anataraashtriya vidyarthi (International student)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""antarrashtriya vidyarthika rupma janka lagi sadharantaya akasmik paryatakka rupma tyahan pugnubhanda lamo basaiko samay chahinchha. Samanyataya, lamo samay awadhika lagi kunai pani videshi mulukma basnu parema tapainlai agrim bhisa prapta garnu jaruri hunchha.""  (Translation: ""Generally, to stay for a long time as an international student requires a visa in advance, unlike a quick tourist visit."")

The passage further details that student visa requirements and application processes *differ* from those for tourists or business travelers, and often require documentation from the educational institution. This emphasizes the need for a detailed visa process specifically for international students.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Niyamit paryatak (Regular tourist):** The passage states tourists *may* not need a visa for short trips.
*   **B: Anubhavi yaatri (Experienced traveler):**  Experience doesn't change the visa requirements.
*   **D: Wyaparik yatri (Business traveler):**  The passage mentions business visas, but notes they are different from student visas, not that detailed visas are *always* required.



"
Machhad dekhi kahile saavadhaan hunu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Varshaban maa (During rainfall)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) discusses needing to think carefully if you're deciding to walk during the rainy season in a subtropical climate. It emphasizes the short window of opportunity to get inside a vehicle when it starts raining heavily.  The question (Q) asks when you should be cautious. Rainfall is the direct context of the caution discussed in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Garmi mahina maa (During hot months):** While the passage mentions *garmima* (heat), the primary concern is the *rain* and the quick onset of danger.
* **B: Paidal yaatra maa (During walking):** Walking itself isn't the danger; it's walking *during the rain*.
* **D: Gaadi chalaauda (While driving):** The passage focuses on getting *into* a vehicle, not the act of driving.



"
Anuchhed anusar varshaban maa gaadi chalaauda machhad baat bachna ke garnu hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaadi ko dhoka laamo samay samma khula chodna** (Leaving the car unlocked for a long time).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that if you are considering walking away from your car during a warm/hot period, you need to think carefully.  It then explains that *if* you're in a subtropical climate, you have a few seconds to get back into the car before it becomes dangerously hot.  This implies the risk is leaving the car unlocked and unattended, allowing it to heat up excessively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Garmi maa gaadi chalaauda** (Driving a car in the heat) - The passage doesn't discuss driving *in* the heat, only leaving a parked car.
* **C: Subtropical kshetra maa gaadi chalaauda** (Driving a car in a subtropical area) - Same as B, focuses on driving, not leaving the car.
* **D: Paidal yaatra garda gaadi laai eklai chodnu** (Leaving the car alone while going for a walk) - While related, the *danger* emphasized isn’t just leaving it alone, but the rapid heating up of the car *while* left unattended.  The passage focuses on the consequences of that unattended time.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye sundarbans ko bare kun vakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: Yasko aadha bhaag daldal le bharieko chha** (Approximately half of it is filled with wetlands).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sundarbanle 3,850 warga kilometer kshetrafal ogateko cha, jasmadhye karib ek tihai bhag pani ra daldal kshetraharule dhakieko cha."" (Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is covered by water and wetlands.)

One-third is *not* half. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Yas maa baaki raheka kehi thula jungle parchhan** (This contains some of the last remnants of large forests) - The passage says: ""yiniharuma kunai samayama gangako maidan sametne ati thulo jangalko kehi antim baaki sthanharu samawesh chan."" (These include some of the last remaining places of very large forests, including the Gangetic plains.)
* **C: Yo sansar ko sabai bhanda thulo mangrove belt ho** (This is the largest mangrove belt in the world) - The passage starts with: ""Sunderban wishwako sabaibhanda thulo samudri kinarako mangrove belt ho..."" (Sundarban is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt...)
* **D: Yaha paate bagh bhanda dherai chittal chhan** (There are more deer here than tigers) - The passage states: ""Sun 1966 dekhi sunderban vanyajantu arakshan kendra bhaeko cha ra yass kshetrama ahile 400 vata shahi bengal bagh ra lagbhag 30,000 harinharu raheko anuman gariyeko cha."" (Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary and is estimated to have 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer.)  30,000 is much greater than 400.



"
Jungle ko kun bhaag bharatiya simaa bhitra parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans rashtriya nikunja (Sundarbans National Park)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""bharatiya khetra bhitrako jangalko bhaglai sunderban rashtriya park bhaninchha"" which translates to ""The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vanyajnantu aarakshan (Wildlife Sanctuary):** While Sundarbans *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the text says the *part within India* is specifically the National Park.
*   **C: Vishwa sampada kshetra (World Heritage Site):** This describes the entire Sundarbans region, not just the Indian part.
*   **D: Gangetic plain:** The text mentions the Gangetic plain *as part* of the forest, but it's not the name of the part within Indian territory.



"
Anuchhed anusar ko sanga angrezi bhasa ko sabai bhanda kam gyaan huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Kam umerkaa manis (Young people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dherai sampurna deshharu angrejima purna ruple sahaj chan ra ajha badhima tapain vishesh gari yuva manisharu majh simit gyanko apeksha garna saknuhunchha.""  This translates to: ""Many complete countries are easily fluent in English, and nowadays you may expect limited knowledge especially from young people.""

Therefore, the passage specifically suggests that *young people* might have less knowledge of English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aru dui bhasa bolne manis (People who speak two other languages):** The passage doesn't suggest a correlation between knowing other languages and English proficiency.
* **C: Toronto ghumne manis (People visiting Toronto):** Toronto isn't mentioned in relation to English knowledge.
* **D: Badhi umerkaa manis (Older people):** The passage implies the opposite - that older generations are *more* likely to be fluent.



"
Anuchhed anusar ke uccharan garna kathin hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Thegaana** (accents).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yo visheshgari theganaharuma sahi hunchha, june prayaha bujhine gari uchcharan garna gahro hunchhan."" This translates to: ""This is especially true of accents, which are easy to understand when written but difficult to pronounce.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhinna uccharan kaa sabda** (words with different pronunciation) - While related, the passage specifically highlights the *difficulty in pronouncing* accents, not just different pronunciations of words.
* **C: Lekhieka sabda** (written words) - The passage states written words are *easier* to understand.
* **D: Sthaaniya argot** (local slang) - The passage *mentions* local slang as part of the conversation, but the primary difficulty mentioned is with pronunciation due to accents.



"
Anuchhed anusar antar jilla station baata bus line yaatru laai kun avastha aadarsha hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yaatru jakar tarfa jaadaichha ra usle agadi nai ticket kinisakeko chha** (The traveler is going towards Jakar and has already bought a ticket).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Antara-zilla prasthan gurney basharu pry: bhari hune bhaekale kehi dinaghi nai tikat katna salah diinchha."" This means it's advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance, especially if the buses are full.  This implies needing a ticket *before* arriving at the station.
* **The text also mentions:** buses to Jakar/Bumthang leave at 06:30 and 07:30. Going *towards* Jakar aligns with this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says buses to Bumthang leave at 7:30, but doesn't state a *need* to arrive *by* 7.
* **C:** The text mentions Paro, but there's no information about leaving *after* 11 am.  It focuses on speed and comfort via taxis for Paro, not bus schedules.
* **D:** The text doesn't mention travel to the ""north"" (uttar).  The bus schedules focus on Jakar and Bumthang. It does mention arriving around 6:20, but the text advises buying tickets in advance due to buses filling up.



"
Antar jilla station baata purva tarfa yaatra garne paryatak kaa laagi kun sujhaav thik hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Agrim ticket kinne (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Antara-zilla prasthan gurney basharu pry: bhari hune bhaekale kehi dinaghi nai tikat katna salah diinchha.""  This directly translates to ""It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance if the inter-district departure point is likely to be crowded.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bus haru 8:30 pachhi maatra chutchhan (Buses only leave after 8:30):** The passage states buses leave at 6:30 and 7:30 *before* 8:30.
* **C: Din bhar dherai gaadi hinchhan (There are many vehicles throughout the day):** The passage doesn’t state there are many vehicles all day, just schedules for specific times.
* **D: Saajha garieka taaxi yaatra garne sabai bhanda upayukta maadhyam hun (Shared taxis are the most suitable means of travel):** While taxis are mentioned for nearby destinations like Paro and Punkha, the passage doesn't say they are the *most* suitable for eastward travel.  It focuses on the bus and the need to book in advance.



"
Yea madhye kun kura le timbuktu lai sahi rupma janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yaha plane maa pugna sakidaina**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...yosanga ek airport cha."" ( ...and it has an airport). This directly contradicts the statement that you can't reach Timbuktu by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are *supported* by the text:

* **A: Yas maa muluk ko baaki thaau bhanda arabic prabhaav badhi chha** - The text says ""Sheher deshka any shaharharubhanda bilkulai viparit ho kinbhane yasama africibhanda arbi maulikta badhi cha."" (The city is completely different from other cities in the country because Arabic originality is more here than in Africa).
* **B: Yo garibi le pidit chha** - The text says ""Aja, timbuktu ek garib banaieko sahar ho..."" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor city...).
* **D: Yo jigyaasi paryatak haruko laagi aakarshan ko kendra ho** - The text says ""...yasako pratishthale yasalai paryatak akarshan banaunchha..."" (its prestige makes it a tourist attraction...)



Therefore, only option C is demonstrably *false* based on the provided text."
Ti madhye timbuktu ko baare kun tathya sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Yaha chimeki sahar haru bhanda kam african shaili chha** (Here, there is less African style than neighboring cities).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sheher deshka any shaharharubhanda bilkulai viparit ho kinbhane yasama africibhanda arbi maulikta badhi cha."" This directly translates to ""The city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arabic originality than African."" This means it has *less* African influence compared to other cities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo sahar plane maa pugna sakinchha** (This city can be reached by plane) - While the passage mentions an airport, it doesn't definitively state it's currently operational or accessible.
* **B: Yo garib bhanda badhi aakarshak chha** (This is more attractive than poor) - The passage says it's a poor city *but* has potential for tourism, not that it's more attractive than being poor.
* **D: Yo sahar le paryatak laai aakarshit gardaina** (This city does not attract tourists) - The passage specifically says it has the *potential* to be a tourist attraction.



"
Grisma olympic suru maa kaha aayojana garne yojana thiyo? ,"The correct answer is **A: August 2021**.

The text states: ""Paralympic 24 augustdekhi 5 september 2021 samma hunechha."" (The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.) Although it doesn't *explicitly* say when the Summer Olympics were planned to start, it implies the timeframe as being around the same period, as it discusses cancellation policies related to the 2020 Olympics initially scheduled for July 2020, but then held in August 2021.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun bindu maa funnel chakrawat banchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Jamin chhoye pachhi** (After leaving the ground).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiniharu bhuima chhunda """"tornado"""" hunchhan."" which translates to ""They become a 'tornado' after leaving the ground."" This directly indicates that the funnel cloud is present *after* it touches down.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jaba bataas 100 mile prati ghanta maa pugchha** (When the wind reaches 100 miles per hour): The passage says high winds *create* tornadoes, but doesn't state this is when the funnel forms.
* **B: Jaba hawa kaa stambha ghumna thalchhan** (When a column of air begins to rotate): This describes the *beginning* of the process, not when the funnel is fully formed.
* **C: Aandhi bataas baata tala jharda** (Storm winds blow from the sky): This describes the origin of the storm, not the funnel itself.



"
Yea madhye kun chakrawat ko sahi viseshata ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo jamin choye pachhi funnel banchha** (It forms a funnel after leaving the ground).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tiniharu bhuima chhunda """"tornado"""" hunchhan."" which translates to ""They become a """"tornado"""" after leaving the ground.""  This describes the funnel shape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yasle jahile 100-200 mile prati ghanta ko raftaar maa baatas ko sirjana garchha** (It always creates wind at a speed of 100-200 miles per hour) - While the passage *mentions* this speed, it's not a defining characteristic *unique* to this type of cyclone.
* **B: Yo praya bhari wastu sanga chalchha** (It moves with heavy objects) - The passage states it *can* lift heavy objects, but that's a *result* of its power, not a defining characteristic.
* **D: Yo hawa bahira thelne ghumne stambha ho** (It is a rotating column pushing air outwards) - The passage describes it as rotating, but doesn’t specifically mention air being pushed *outwards*. It describes it as drawing air *in*.



"
Anuchhed anusar yaatru le aafno gantavya sahar ko raajnitik awastha baare kaha baata sujhaav linu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Bhraman sallahakar maa prasthut bhaekaa vichar** (The ideas presented by the travel consultant).

Here's why:

The passage states that travel advice from consultants should be taken as a brief summary of a country's political situation, *but* it should be compared to more detailed information available elsewhere. It also mentions that advice from other governments is designed for *their* citizens, not necessarily you.

Therefore, the passage suggests relying on the travel consultant's perspective *as a starting point* but not as the definitive truth, and always seeking further, detailed information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uniharu le bhraman garne muluk ko sarkar** (The government of the country you are traveling to) - The passage doesn't suggest directly contacting the government for political assessments.
*   **C: Uniharu le bhraman garne muluk ko naagarik** (Citizens of the country you are traveling to) - The passage doesn't advocate seeking opinions from local citizens regarding the political situation.
*   **D: Aafnai sarkar** (Your own government) - The passage points out that advice from your own government is tailored for *its* citizens, making it potentially less relevant to your specific situation.



"
Bharaman sallaha ko awasthama videshi paryatak le ke anubhav garne sambavana hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Raddha bima maa prabhav** (Impact on cancellation insurance).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tapainko yatrama swasthya bima wa yatra radd bimama asar parna sakcha."" (Your trip may be affected by health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.)  This directly links the travel advice to the potential impact on travel insurance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Muluk ko raajnitik awastha baare ati saralkrit saramsa** (Very simplified summary of the political situation of countries) - The passage *states* the warnings are simplified, but the question asks about an experience a tourist might have, not the nature of the warning itself.
* **C: Swasthya bima maa prabhav** (Impact on health insurance) - While mentioned, the passage equally emphasizes cancellation insurance.
* **D: Muluk ko rajnitik awastha bare wristrit jankari** (Detailed information about the political situation of countries) - The passage actively discourages relying on the warnings as detailed information; it stresses they are *brief* and *simplified*.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun kisim ko yatra maa booking ko lagi travel agent ko sahayata kaam parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Yatri ko pahilo videsh yatra (A traveler's first foreign trip)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are a good option ""when a traveler's experience extends from the thrill of visiting countries with different nature, culture, language or climate."" This implies they are particularly helpful for those unfamiliar with these aspects – essentially, first-time international travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Pahile bhraman garisakeko saharma Karya samelan sammako yatra (A trip to a conference for people who have travelled before):** The passage doesn’t mention this specific scenario. Someone who travels for work conferences is likely already familiar with travel arrangements.
*   **B: Ek nischit budget maa dui hapte lamo bhraman (A two-week trip on a fixed budget):** While some agents specialize in budget travel, the passage doesn't highlight this as a *necessary* reason to use an agent.
*   **C: Bhasa ko kathinai hune bhraman (A trip where language is difficult):**  While agents can help with language barriers, the passage only lists language as *one* of many things agents can assist with. It doesn't suggest this is a primary need for using an agent.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun awastha maa yatru le travel agent bata sabai bhanda badhi faida lina sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaba yatru pahilo palta visesh bhraman ko booking gardai chhan** (When a traveler is booking a special trip for the first time).

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are particularly helpful when a traveler's experience extends beyond simple booking – encompassing nature, culture, language, and unique destinations. This suggests a first-time special trip (vishesh bhraman) would benefit most from an agent's expertise in navigating these complexities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention round-trip flights specifically.
* **C:** While agents can help with language barriers, it's not the *primary* benefit highlighted.
* **D:** The passage says agents help *experience* cultural diversity, not that you need to be already familiar with it.



"
Anuchhed anusar yatru lai naya sthan bhraman garda hune nirasha bata jogina kun kura le madhat garna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aafu aayeko staan maa hune kanun ko palana garnu** (Following the laws of the place you visit).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travelers need to consider many things, including laws (""kanuna""). It warns that not respecting local customs and laws (""shishtachar, kanuna..."") can lead to negative reactions (""nirashabata bachnaka lagi wa sayed sthaniya tarikaharule gurney cam prati ghrina gurney"").  Following the laws is a way to *avoid* disappointment and negative interactions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aafu aayo sthaan jastai saman standard ko apekshya raakhnu** (Expecting the same standards as your home) - The passage warns *against* this. It says things *will* be different.
*   **B: Aparichit khana chaakhne icchha** (Willingness to try unfamiliar food) - While being open-minded is good, the passage doesn't specifically mention food as a key to avoiding disappointment.
*   **D: Aawaas bare agadi anusandhaan nagarnu** (Not researching accommodation in advance) - The passage doesn't discuss accommodation specifically; it’s about general preparedness and respect for the new place.



"
Anuchhed maa prastur jankari anusar kasto vyakti le videshi thau maa bhraman garda nirasha mahasus garna sakchan?,"The correct answer is **B: Pariwartan man paraune** (Those who dislike change).

Here's why:

The passage states that when traveling, many things will be different – customs, laws, food, lodging, places, language, etc. It warns that travelers should be mindful of these differences and that *not keeping them in mind could lead to disappointment or even hostility from locals*.

This directly implies that people who are resistant to change, or who have difficulty adapting to new situations, are most likely to feel disappointed when traveling to a foreign place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jaslai farak swad ko khana man paraune** (Those who dislike differently tasting food): While food is mentioned, the passage's concern is broader than just food preferences.
*   **C: Sanghuro manasikta bhaeko** (Those with a collective mentality): The passage doesn't mention anything about collective vs. individual mindsets.
*   **D: Sikai maa ramaune** (Those who enjoy learning): The passage doesn’t suggest learning is a problem; it highlights the *need* to be aware and respectful of differences.



"
Vikasashil desh maa pahilo patak bhraman garne yatru ko laagi yea madhye kun sujhav ko sifaris garidaena?,"The most relevant advice from the passage for a first-time traveler to a developing country is **A: Jamin maa sutnu bhanda aghi sthaniya jivjantu ko bare jankari linu** (Learn about local wildlife before landing on the ground).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically warns about dangers from wildlife** (snakes, scorpions) and the need to be prepared when venturing outside of camp.  Knowing about these dangers *before* you go is crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported by the passage:

* **B: Pahilo kehi din maa khana maa dherai kharcha nagarnu** (Don't spend a lot on food in the first few days) - While the passage mentions the cost of Western-style hotels and food, it doesn't *advise* against spending money on it, only that it's a consideration.
* **C: Baahira camping garda khat waa jhula ko prayog garnu** (Use a hammock or mosquito net when camping outside) -  The passage mentions taking a ""khat wa jholungo"" (hammock or net) for protection, but it's presented as a *necessity* due to dangers, not a general suggestion.
* **D: Suru maa aauda gunastariya hotel maa lagani garnu** (Invest in a high-quality hotel at the beginning) - The passage actually *suggests* considering the high cost of such hotels, implying it might not be the best starting point.



Therefore, **A** is the most direct and important piece of advice taken from the text.



"
Vikasashil desh maa parichit hudai garda yea madhye kun kura maa badhi kharcha garna ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Paschimi shailiko khana (Western-style food)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions considering significant expenses for:

*   **Gunastariya hotelharu (High-quality hotels)**
*   **Gunastariya sewa (High-quality service)**
*   **Camping garda gadha waa pad (Donkey or footwear for camping)**

However, it only *mentions* Western-style food as something being *established* (bani basauna), but doesn't say it will be a significant *expense* to consider.  The passage implies it's something one *might* do, but not necessarily a substantial cost.

Therefore, Western-style food is the only option not explicitly linked to potential high expenditure in the text.



"
Internet maa pahuch nabhaeko virtual pratilip chahane policy holder kaa lagi kun vikalpa utkrista hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Laptop ko memory maa ek pratilipi bhandar garnu** (Store a copy on the laptop's memory).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ek lattop wa tabletko sath yatrama aipugchha, yo memory wa diskma pratilipi garnuhos kripaya (internet bina nai pahunch yogya).""  This directly translates to ""When traveling with a laptop or tablet, please make a copy on its memory or disk (accessible even without internet).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yatra ko sathi lai ek pratilipi dinu** (Give a copy to a travel companion) - While mentioned as *helpful*, it's not the best option for *access without internet* for the policyholder themselves.
* **B: Aafulai ek pratilip email garnu** (Email a copy to yourself) - Requires internet access.
* **D: “cloud” maa ek pratilipi bhandar garnu** (“cloud” store a copy in the) - Requires internet access.

The key phrase in the original text is ""(internet bina nai pahunch yogya)"" - ""accessible even without internet"".  Only storing it on a laptop/tablet's memory fulfills that requirement.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura policy maa dekhauna pardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Pramarikaran ko lagi antaaashtriya phone number** (International phone number for verification).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the international phone number should be shown for *claims/rights and lawsuits* (""salah/adhikar ra davi garna""). It doesn't mention needing it for *verification* (""pramarikaran"").  The other options – claim email, policyholder email – are explicitly mentioned as needing to be provided.

Let's break down the relevant parts of the Nepali text:

* **""Uniharule salah/adhikar ra davi garna bimakartako email thegana ra antarrashtriya phone number dekhaunu parchha.""** -  ""They should show the policyholder's email address and international phone number to file claims/exercise rights and for lawsuits.""

Therefore, international phone number for verification isn’t a requirement according to the passage.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun negative koo aakar le saamanyataya prayog hune film dhaachaa lai pratibimbit garchha?,"The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm negative**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""35 mimmy film (36 gauna 24 mimmy negative) mapdanda sabaibhanda dherai samanya cha.""  This translates to ""35mm film (36 x 24mm negative) is the most common standard.""

Therefore, the 36 x 24mm negative represents the standard, commonly used film size discussed in the passage.
"
Yea madhye kun film dancha le dSLR ko jastai resolution dinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm film**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""35 mimmy film (36 gauna 24 mimmy negative) mapdanda sabaibhanda dherai samanya cha...halko DSLR ko tulanama jhandai ustai resolution dinchha.""  This directly translates to ""35mm film... gives almost the same resolution as a light DSLR.""

The passage goes on to describe how medium format and larger formats have *higher* resolution than 35mm film, not the same. Therefore, options B, C, and D are incorrect.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye bhraman lekhan vyapar suru garne antim kadam kun ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Aafno website banaunu** (Creating your own website).

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that the easiest way to start a travel writing business is to **establish a travel blog and put it on a website**. It emphasizes creating your own website to easily manage content and format it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Web dhancha ko abhyas** (Studying web frameworks) - While potentially helpful, the passage doesn't mention this as a final step.
* **B: Kunai pratisthit bhraman blog maa thuprai lekh haru lekhnu** (Writing guest posts on established travel blogs) - This isn't mentioned as the *final* step in starting *your own* business.
* **D: Aafno sampadan ko ship tikharnu** (Setting your editing skills) - Important, but a prerequisite *before* building the website, not the final step.



"
Bhraman lekhan vyapar suru garda yea madhye kun kshamata surumaa parishkrit garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Website ko nirman (Website creation)**.

**Here's why:**

The passage (P) explicitly states that the easiest way to start a travel writing business is to **establish a travel blog and have a website**. Therefore, the foundational skill to prioritize when starting is website creation.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

*   **A: Blogging (ब्लॉगिंग):** While blogging is *part* of the business, you need a platform (website) *to* blog on.
*   **B: Web dhanchaa banaune (Web structure creation):** This is a component of website creation, but not the overarching skill.
*   **C: Sampadan (Editing):** Editing is important for the content *on* the website, but not the first step in setting it up.



"
Kasto mausaam maa samanyataya aandra ko samasya dekhaa parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Chiso mausam (Cold weather)**.

The text states: ""Chiso mausam shwasprashwasasambandhi samasya bhaejhain, garmi mausam andraka samasyaharu samanya hunchhan..."" which translates to ""Cold weather causes respiratory problems, while heat-related problems are common...""

Therefore, the text explicitly links *aandra ko samasya* (problems with the body/illness) to *chiso mausam* (cold weather).



"
Anuchhed anusar lagatar ko prasharan ke ko pratirodhaatmak kshamata badhchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthaniya kitaanu (Local germs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gharma, **sthaniya ki nirantar prasharanko karanle**, tapainko pratirodhak shaktile pahilenai tiniharulai jiteka hunchhan.""  This translates to: ""Due to constant exposure to **local germs**, your immune system has already learned to defeat them.""

The passage explicitly links continuous exposure to local germs with building immunity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aandra ko samasya (Andra's problem):** The passage mentions Andra's problem as an example of a health issue in a different region, but doesn't link it to building immunity.
*   **C: Swaspraswas ko samasya (Respiratory problems):** The passage states cold weather *causes* respiratory problems, not that exposure to it builds immunity.
*   **D: Delhi Belly:**  This is mentioned as an example of an illness one might get in a new location, but doesn't relate to building immunity.



"
Schengen kshetra bhitra bhraman garnu ko faaida ke ho?,"Correct answer is **A: Dherai bhisa aavedan bata joginu** and **B: Paisa ko bachat**.

The text explicitly states: ""sengena bhisa paepachi, tapainle pratyek sengena sadasya deshharuko bhisaka lagi chhutta-chhuttai avedan dinu awashyak chhaina, yasakaran samay, paisa ra kagaji karyaharu bachat hunechha."" This translates to ""Once you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for a visa for each Schengen member country, saving time, money and paperwork.""

Therefore, the benefits of travelling within the Schengen area are avoiding multiple visa applications and saving money.



"
Tutankhamunko chihan ma ke bhetidaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhan sampatti (Wealth/Treasures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chihanko adbhut sampattiharu ab yasama chhainan, tar yea kayaroko egyptian sangrahalayama lagieka chan.""  This translates to ""The wonderful treasures of the tomb are no longer here, but they have been placed in the Egyptian Museum.""

Therefore, you *won't* find the treasures inside the tomb (KV62) anymore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kehi sajawat (Some decoration):** The passage says the tomb has *limited* decoration, meaning some is still present.
* **B: Mummy ko tauko (Mummy's head):** The passage specifically mentions seeing the head and shoulders.
* **C: Mummy ko kandh (Mummy's shoulders):** The passage specifically mentions seeing the head and shoulders.



"
Annuchhed anusar mulya bare sachet yatru kaa lagi vancouver ko kun gantavya kam aakarshak hunchha? ,"Correct answer is **D: Whistler**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whisler (bhyankuwarbata 1.5 ghantako drive) mahango raheko cha"" which translates to ""Whistler (1.5 hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive."" This directly implies Whistler might be less attractive to budget-conscious travelers (mulya bare sachet yatru - travelers conscious of cost).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Granville Island:** The passage mentions it as a popular destination with restaurants and shops, not related to cost.
*   **Sea to Sky corridor:**  The passage mentions this as a route to get to destinations, not as being expensive.
*   **Bowen tapu:** The passage mentions this as a popular day/weekend trip, not specifically related to cost.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun gantavya le yatru lai vancouver ko asali anubhav dinchha?,"Correct answer: **A: Bowen tapu**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bowen tapu kayaking, paidal yatra, kinmail, restaurant ra thap kuraharu pradan gariraheko lokpriya dinko yatra wa saptahantako bhraman ho. Yo pramanik samudaya bhyankubharko thik chheu hove soundma awasthit cha ra bhyankubhar mukhya shaharko granbhil tapu prasthan gurney talikabadha pani taxiharubata sajilai pugna sakinchha."" 

This translates to: ""Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend getaway, offering kayaking, hiking, shops and restaurants. It is conveniently accessible from Vancouver by ferry.""  This directly positions Bowen Island as providing an experience *from* Vancouver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Whistler:** The text mentions Whistler, but highlights it as a separate, more expensive destination (1.5 hours from Vancouver) known for skiing and mountain biking. It's *near* Vancouver, but doesn’t give the immediate Vancouver experience.
*   **C: Downtown Vancouver:** The text states Bowen Island is near Vancouver but doesn't emphasize downtown Vancouver as a destination itself.
*   **D: Granville Island:** Granville Island isn't mentioned in the text at all.



"
Anuchhed anusar kunai roktok bina drishya ko awalokan garna yatrule kahile falls ko bhraman garnu parchha?,"Sahi jawab hai: **C: Pani ko matra uccha bhaeko bela**

Anuchhed ma bhari prastut gariyo chha ki warsha ritu (November dekhi March samma) ma pani ko matra dherai badhi hunchha ra jharana jhana badhi natakiya hunchha. Yani ki pani ko matra uccha bhaeko bela jharana herna garnele pani ko bhari drishya paiecha, tar jharanako drishya aspashta hunecha.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: November dekhi March bhari samma:** While this is the rainy season, the question asks *when* to see the falls with obstructed views.
*   **B: Paryatan sijan maa:** The passage mentions tourism, but doesn't link it to visibility.
*   **D: Varsha season bahira:**  The passage implies that the view is *most* obstructed *during* the rainy season."
Anuchhed anusar november ra march ko bichaa victoria falls jharana ko faida ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Jharana ko natakiya drishya (Dramatic view of the waterfall)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Warsha ritu (novemberdekhi march samma) maa, paniko matra dherai badhi hunechha ra jharana jhana badhi natakiya hunechha.""  This translates to: ""During the rainy season (November to March), the amount of water increases greatly and the waterfall becomes much more dramatic.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jharana ko khulla drishya (Clear view of the waterfall):** The passage actually says the *visibility* can be obscured due to the amount of water.
*   **B: Kam paryatak (Fewer tourists):** The passage doesn't mention a decrease in tourists during this time.
*   **D: Varsha season bata joginu (Benefit from the rainy season):** While the increased water is a characteristic *of* the rainy season, the passage highlights the dramatic view as the benefit, not just the season itself.



"
Anuchhed anusar video khichna ko lagi drone ko prayog garda ke sifaris garidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Kun kura ko video khichne anumati chha bhanera suruma janch garnu** (First check what you are allowed to video).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yadi drone prayog garirahnu bhaeko cha bhane, tapainlai key khichna anumati diieko cha ra ke anumati wa thap ijajatpatra awashyak cha bhanera ramrari jaanch garnuhos."" - ""If you are using a drone, carefully check what you are allowed to film and what permits or licenses are required.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Thap license linu** (Get a license) - While a license *might* be required, the passage prioritizes *finding out* what is permitted first.
* **C: Anumati ko bare anusandhan garnu** (Research permissions) - This is similar to A, but A is more direct about the first step.
* **D: Bhid bhaeko sthaan maa matra video khichnu jaha drone lai chal paudaina** (Only film in crowded areas where drones cannot be flown) - The passage strongly advises *against* flying drones near airports or crowded areas.



"
Anuchhed anusar drone dwara video khichna sabai bhanda upayukta sthan kaha chhan?,"Correct answer is **D: Agrim anumati lieyeko kshetra maa** (In areas with prior permission).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you should **""ramrari jaanch garnuhos""** (check carefully) what permission is needed if you're using a drone, and whether you are allowed to film. This directly implies that filming with a drone is most appropriate where you *have* that prior permission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhid najik taki drone ko upasthiti le kunai farak naparos** (Near buildings so the presence of the drone doesn't matter) - The passage warns against flying drones near buildings, making this unsafe and incorrect.
*   **B: Niyamit photograhy ko anumati nabhaeka kshetra** (Areas where regular photography is not allowed) - The passage explicitly states *not* to even consider filming a video if photos aren't allowed.
*   **C: Drone tyati nadekhine vyasta thauma** (Busy places where people don't notice the drone) - This doesn't address the legality or safety concerns. Ignoring the rules isn't a good approach.

Anuchhed anusar bhisa prakriya ko aawashyakta bare yea madhye kun wakya sahi hoina?,"सही उत्तर **A: यदी तपाइँ पर्यटक आवासमा बस्नु भएको छ भने तपाइले दर्ता गर्नु पर्दैन** हो।

अनुच्छेदमा स्पष्ट रूपमा भनिएको छ कि केही देशहरूमा पर्यटक आवास बाहिर बस्नेहरूले दर्ता गर्नुपर्छ। यसले विकल्प A लाई गलत बनाउँछ।

अन्य विकल्पहरू सही छन्:

*   **B:** अनुच्छेदमा भनिएको छ कि केही देशहरूमा स्थानीय अधिकारीहरूसँग दर्ता गर्न आवश्यक हुन्छ।
*   **C:** अनुच्छेदमा भनिएको छ कि दर्ता प्रक्रियाको लागि स्थानीय प्रहरी स्टेशनमा जानु वा अध्यागमन कार्यालयमा जानु आवश्यक पर्न सक्छ।
*   **D:** अनुच्छेदमा भनिएको छ कि धेरै देशहरूमा स्थानीय होटलहरूले दर्ता प्रक्रिया सम्हाल्छन्।"
Yea madhye paryatak darta ko lagi kun sthan jadainan?,"The correct answer is **D: Adhyagaman karyalaya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...yasaka lagi sthaniya praharika sath faram bharna wa **adhyagaman karyalayama jaan** awashyak parna sakcha."" This translates to ""...for this, it may be necessary to fill out a local police form or **go to the immigration office**.""

While hotels *sometimes* handle the registration process, it's not always guaranteed. The text emphasizes checking first. Immigration offices are a definitive place to register as a tourist.



"
Bhraman ko bela swayamsewak ko kam garera kaslai faida hudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Paryapta talab kamaune aash garnele (Those hoping to earn sufficient money)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while volunteering while traveling is a good way to bring change, it shouldn't be done *just* to save money. It mentions many volunteers receive room and board, and *sometimes* a small stipend, but it's not a reliable way to earn a good income.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Videsh maa naya sathi banauna chahanele (Those wanting to make new friends abroad):** The passage *supports* this as a benefit - ""Sanskriti chine, naya wyaktilai bhetne..."" (getting to know cultures, meeting new people...)
* **C: Naya ship sikna chahanele (Those wanting to learn new skills):**  The passage mentions getting new recommendations and understanding perspectives (""naya sipharu prapta gurney drishtikonko bhawana bujhne"") suggesting skill development.
* **D: Kotha ra khana maa ruchi rakhnele (Those interested in room and board):** The passage specifically states many volunteer positions *provide* room and board.



"
Anuchhed anusar budget maa videsh bhraman garne yatru ko lagi swayamsewa kasari faidajanak chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kahile kahi kotha ra khana pradan garinchha** (Sometimes provides accommodation and food).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dherai swayamsevak rojgariharule kotha ra board pradan gardachan ra kehile thorai talab pani bhuktan gardachan."" This directly translates to ""many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and board, and sometimes even pay a small allowance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Talab lagbhag sadhai pradan garinchha** (Allowance is almost always provided): The passage says ""kehile thorai talab pani bhuktan gardachan"" - *sometimes* an allowance is paid, not *almost always*.
*   **B: Yasle kam ko awasar sirjana garchha** (It creates job opportunities): The passage doesn't focus on creating job opportunities, but rather offering volunteer positions.
*   **D: Yasle tapailai naya drishtikon pradan garna sakchha** (It can give you a new perspective): While the passage mentions gaining new perspectives as a benefit of volunteering abroad, it doesn’t specifically highlight this as the *financial* benefit for budget travelers.



"
Anuchhed anusar walt disney world ko saamanya bhraman ko laagi ke asamanya maaninchha?,"Correct answer: **C: Bhraman ko sabai samay disney ko kshetra maa bitaaunu**

Here's why:

The passage states that a ""typical"" Disney World trip includes staying at an *on-site* Disney hotel and spending a week *within Disney property*. It specifically contrasts this with people buying partial-day tickets from sites like Craigslist, which are *not* allowed for transfer and therefore don’t fit the “typical” experience of being fully immersed in the Disney world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Paark gumera ek hapta bitaaunu** - While true of many trips, it's not the *unusual* aspect highlighted in the text.
*   **B: Off-site hotel maa basnu** - The passage says typical trips involve *on-site* hotels, so staying off-site would be the opposite of typical.
*   **D: vimansthal dekhi hotel bus maa yaatra garnu** - The passage doesn't mention how people get from the airport to the hotel, so this isn't relevant to what makes a trip typical or atypical.



"
Yea madhye kun vaakya walt disney world kaa bare sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Park-hopper ticket aru yaatriko maa saarna milchha** (Park-hopper tickets are shared with other travelers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: **""disnidwara nished garieko cha: tikatharu sthanantaran garna yogya chhainan.""** (Disney prohibits the transfer of tickets - they are not transferable.) This means park-hopper tickets *cannot* be shared with other travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: On-site aawas ko vyavastha** (On-site accommodation) - The passage states ""ek un-site disney hotelma basnu"" (staying at an on-site Disney hotel).
* **C: vimansthal dekhi sthal samma yaatru osaarna bus ko suvidha raheko chha** (There is a bus facility to pick up passengers from the airport) - The passage mentions flying into Orlando International Airport, implying transportation is part of the package. While it doesn't *explicitly* mention a bus, it's a common assumption and doesn't contradict the text.
* **D: Lilami website maa praaya dherai din ko ticket bhetincha** (Many day tickets are found on auction websites) - The passage states ""Ibe wa craiglist jasta lilami websitebata bikri garine dheraijaso tikatharu anshik rupma prayog garieka dherai dinka park-hopper tikat hunchhan."" (Many tickets for many days are found for sale on auction websites like eBay and Craigslist.)



Therefore, only option A is demonstrably false based on the information provided in the passage."
Ancuhhed anusar yea madhye kun vishaya vyavasaayik prashikshan wa prakashan maa bhetidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Banjar bhumi maa kasari baachne (How to survive in barren land)**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions:

*   **Prathamik upachaar ko tayari (First aid preparation):** explicitly stated as part of the training.
*   **Yuddha kshetra maa tatparta (Preparedness for the battlefield):**  The entire context revolves around battlefield training.
*   **Bhumika nibhaauna (Role-playing):** stated as part of the training program.

However, the passage focuses on jungle/nature conservation, battlefield scenarios, and relevant skills. It **doesn't** mention anything about survival techniques in barren lands. Therefore, that's the topic you *wouldn't* find addressed in the training or publications described.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun vishaya vyavasaayik prasikshan ko kaksha maa utaaine sambhawana huncha?,"The correct answer is **A: Prathamik upachhar (First Aid)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the course ""samawesh hunechha...thuprai prathamik upchar"" (includes...first aid). This means first aid training is a part of the professional training course mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yuddha kshetra (Battlefield):** While the course is *about* a battlefield-like environment, it's not a *subject* taught within the course itself.
*   **C: Banjar bhumi maa kasari baachne (How to survive in barren land):** The passage mentions jungle and nature conservation, not barren lands.
*   **D: Shatrutapurna watawaran (Hostile environment):** This is the *setting* of the training, not something you are specifically *trained* in. The course prepares you *for* a hostile environment, but doesn't teach it as a subject.



"
Anuchhed anusar sambhaavit rupmaa dushit pani bata jogina ramro vikalpa ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Bottle ko pani kinnu** (Buying bottled water).

Here's why:

The passage states that you should choose water from a reputable company in a sealed bottle. This implies that bottled water is a good alternative to potentially contaminated water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Thuprai minute samma pani umalnu** (Boiling water for several minutes) - The passage mentions boiling, but says the time needed varies (""kehi kshetraharuma ek minute pani umalna paryapta cha, aruma dherai minute awashyak cha"").  It doesn't suggest this is *always* a good solution.
*   **C: Ek minute samma pani umalnu** (Boiling water for one minute) - The passage states that one minute might be enough *in some areas*, implying it's not universally effective.
*   **D: Nischit jokhim ko laagi pani ko janch garnu** (Getting water tested for specific risks) - While testing is a good practice, the passage doesn't mention it as a readily available solution.



"
Anuchhed anusar dakshya paudibaaj ko lagi pani kun kura jhandai asambhav hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bahav ko virudhamaa paudanu (Swimming against the current)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dheraijaso mrityuharu thakaiko parinamswarup chhalko praaha viruddha paudin khojnale garda hunchhan june asambhawa huna sakdachha.""  This translates to: ""Due to the many deaths caused by drowning, searching for people swimming *against the current* is often impossible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samudri chattan ko najikai paudanu (Swimming near sea rocks):** The passage mentions dangers near sea rocks (""Prayaha chattanma wa yastai prakarma chir praaha…""), but doesn't state it's *impossible* – just dangerous.
*   **B: Gahiro panimaa paudanu (Swimming in deep water):**  The passage indicates deep water can create strong currents, but doesn't say swimming in it is impossible.
*   **D: Chal ko waripari paudanu (Swimming over waves):** While challenging, the passage doesn't say this is impossible.



"
Yadi bahaav maa adkiyemaa ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Arko dishaa tarfa nishaana banaaera bahaav baata baahira niskane prayas garnu parchha ra tyaspachhi kinaar maa saamanya rupmaa paudanu parchha.**

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states: ""Tapain begbata bahira niskanebittikai paudi khelnu samanyabhanda dherai gahro hundaina. Jahaan tapainlai feri samatidaina wa tapainko kaushaltama ra tapainlai dhyan diyeko cha ki chhaina bhannema adharit rahera kunai thaaunko lakshya banaune cosis garnuhos, jahaan tapain uddharka lagi kurna chahan saknuhunecha.""  This translates to: ""It is not much deeper to swim out of the rip current aiming for another direction. Try to aim for a place where you can get rescued, without basing it on whether you can make it or not, or your skill.""

Therefore, the best course of action is to swim *parallel* to the shore (another direction) to get out of the current and *then* swim towards the shore normally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bahaav viruddha chito paudanu parchha:** (Swim against the current) - This is extremely dangerous and will exhaust you.
* **C: Viparit dishaama paudanu parchha:** (Swim in the opposite direction) -  Similar to B, this is fighting the current and won't work.
* **D: Sataha muni paudanu parchha:** (Swim under the surface) - This doesn't address the rip current issue and isn't a recommended safety tactic.



"
Anuchhed anusar vidaa ko bhraman ko bela kun sthaan ko mahal ghumna upayukta huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Rhine upatyaka maa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""loire upatyaka, rhine u bhaeka mahalharu yatra gurney wa danyubko chakhlagda siteharuka lagi kruj line wa eri naharma dunga khiyaune."" This directly states that Rhine valley (Rhine upatyaka) is a place where castles/palaces are suitable for cruises and tours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Danube tira ko sahar** - While Danube is mentioned as a site for cruises, the passage doesn't focus on cities *on* the Danube.
* **B: Erie nahar ko chheu** - Erie Canal is mentioned, but not specifically as a place to see palaces/castles.
* **D: kunai aantarik jalmarga najikai** - Too broad. The passage provides specific examples, and Rhine Valley is the best answer based on the given text.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura bhraman garne mahila lai sifaris garidaina?,"Correct answer is **A: Vaivaahik awastha baare kura nagarna**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that women are advised *not* to worry about a woman's marital status when traveling and *not* to insist they are married if they aren't. This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Saanskritik bhinnata ko kaaran le sthaniya baata jabarjasti vyavahaar nimtane tarfa dhyaan dina** - The passage encourages understanding the beliefs about conception due to cultural differences, and the practice of hand-holding.
*   **C: Chamkilo gahana nalagaauna** - The passage mentions using adornments (aunthi), but specifically says *not* to use expensive ones. So it doesn't discourage adornment entirely.
*   **D: Aawashyak pareko belaa maa kathortaa ko prayog garna** - The passage encourages strength and standing one's ground, which aligns with using assertiveness when necessary.

**Therefore, the passage explicitly recommends *against* inquiring about marital status.**"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko kshetra anusar mahila yaatri kaa laagi kun sujhaav sahayogi hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Vaivaahik sthiti janaauna thulo aaunthi lagaaunu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Mahila yo sifaris garieko cha ki kunai pani mahila yatrule wastawik waiwahik sthitiko parwaha nagari uniharu vivahit bhaeko bhannupardacha.""  This translates to: ""It is recommended that women travelling alone do not care about their actual marital status and should say they are married.""  The passage then suggests wearing a large ring (aunthi) to support this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kasaile pichha garnu asaamanya ho (It is unusual to follow someone)** – While the passage mentions not being afraid to include things like shaking hands, it doesn't focus on following people.
* **C: Saanskritik bhinnata ko kaaran le aafno kura maa adig bhaera basi narahanu (Don't be shy to speak your mind because of cultural differences)** -  The passage encourages understanding cultural differences, but doesn't say to be forceful or not shy.
* **D: Nachaahine vyavahaar ko sambandhamaa purush aswikaar garna dridh bannu ho (Be strong in rejecting unwanted advances from men)** - While generally good advice, this isn't the *specific* suggestion made in the passage for women travellers in this region.



"
Ancuhhed anusar kun awasthama wanyajantu ko photgrapher ko laagi visesh lens ko prayog aawashyak hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sana jantu ko photo khichne bela** (When photographing small animals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wildlife photographyka lagi praya: lamo telephoto lensko awashyak pareta pani charaharuko bathan wa sanah prani jasta chijlai any prakarka lensharu chahinchha."" This translates to: ""While wildlife photography often requires long telephoto lenses, for photographing creatures like birds or small animals, different types of lenses are needed.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B:** The passage mentions rules for professional use, but doesn't say special lenses are *required* in that situation.
*   **C:** Shyness of the animal doesn't dictate lens choice.
*   **D:** Rules in the park don't necessarily mean a special lens is needed.



"
Anuchhed maa yea madhye wanyajantu ko photographer ko laagi kun kura sambhawit chunauti kaa rupmaa ullkeh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Aawashyak lens ko prakar baare shrot khojda** (Finding sources about the type of lens required).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wildlife photographyka lagi praya: lamo telephoto lensko awashyak pareta pani charaharuko bathan wa sanah prani jasta chijlai any prakarka lensharu chahinchha.""  This means the passage *discusses* the lens types needed. It doesn’t say finding information *about* the lens types is a challenge.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as challenges:

* **A: Visesh janawaar haru ko khoji** (Finding specific animals): The passage says ""Dherai lopanmukh janawarharu bhettauna gahro hunchha"" (It is difficult to find many elusive animals).
* **B: Aakramak janawaar ko saamana garda** (Facing aggressive animals): The passage states ""Jungli janawarharu lajalu wa akramak hoon sakchhan"" (Wild animals can be shy or aggressive).
* **D: Pratikul watavaran maa kam garda** (Working in adverse environments): The passage states ""watawaran chiso, tato wa shatrutapurna huna sakcha"" (The environment can be cold, hot, or hostile).

Therefore, the only option *not* presented as a challenge in the passage is finding information about the required lens types."
Yea madhye kun kura le himali kshetra maa sawari chalaune ko laagi kam samasya nimtyauna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kam drishyata (Low visibility)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Himm aandhiko belama, tapainlai dherai come samayama pani dherai hiunle adkauna sakdachha. Hiu parera wa udaera wa sawari sadhanko jhyalma baklo buff wa barafdwara herne drishyata pratibandhit hoon sakha."" This directly translates to: ""During blizzards, you can get stuck in a lot of snow even in a short time. Snow falling or blowing around can obstruct the view while driving.""  Therefore, low visibility is a significant problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Traffic ko chaap (Traffic congestion):** The passage mentions traffic *blockages* due to snow and ice, not congestion as a primary problem.
* **B: Kam gharshan (Low friction):** The passage explicitly states that snow and ice *reduce* friction (""Barfilo ra hiun bhaeka roadharuma, gharshan come hunchha..."").  Low friction is a problem, not a solution.
* **C: Uccha sakshepan (High altitude):** While altitude is inherent to mountain regions, the passage focuses on the *effects of snow and ice*, not altitude itself, as driving challenges.



"
Vibhinna desh harumaa aaya kar sambandhi kun kura saman rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Deshanusar ayakarsambandhi farak farak wyawastha garieko hunchha ra **karko darr** ra sima deshpichchhe bhinna hunchha."" (The tax system varies by country, and **tax rates** and limits differ by country).  This indicates that while the *structure* and *where* you pay taxes may differ, the *rates* themselves are a common element, even if they vary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Samrachana (Structure):** The passage explicitly says the *wyawastha* (system/structure) varies.
* **C: Darta garne thaau (Place to pay):** The passage mentions taxes are paid at both federal and local levels in some countries, meaning the *place* to pay is not consistent.
* **D: Kosthak (Brackets):** While tax brackets exist, the passage doesn't highlight them as a universally similar element.



"
Anuchhed anusar yadi tapai anta katai adharit bhaera videsh maa kam garirahanu bhaeko chha bhane tapaile kaha aafno aaya kar bujhaaune sambhawana hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapai praya jaha rahanu hunchha** (Wherever you reside).

Here's why:

The passage states that working abroad means you need to pay taxes in the country you are *based in* (where you live). The other options are too specific or irrelevant:

* **B: Sanyukta rajya america ma (In the United States of America)** - This is only true if you live in the US.
* **C: Tapai le tatkal kam gariraheko deshmaa (In the country where you are currently working)** - The passage emphasizes *residence* for tax purposes, not just where the work is performed.
* **D: Jaha shulka kam hunchha (Where the customs duty is low)** - This is irrelevant to income tax.



"
Vishwa mela lai yea madhe kun vakyale sahi rupmaa janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Rashtra harule bhag lina aawashyak chhaina** (Countries do not necessarily have to participate).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sahabhagi deshharule..."" (Participating countries...) which means countries *do* participate.  The whole point of a World Expo is international participation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Pradarshan harule deshko itihasa ra sanskriti dekhauna sakchhan** (Exhibits can show the country's history and culture) - The text says ""...tiniharuka deshka sanskriti ra itihas dekhauna rashtriya stambhaharuma kalatmak ra shaikshik pradarshanharu prastut garchhan.""
* **B: Banaspatiya pradarshan kalatmak ra saikshik pradarshan sangai dekhaainchhan** (Botanical exhibitions are shown with artistic and educational exhibitions) - The text states that International Horticultural Exhibitions (a type of World Expo) include displays of flowers, botanical gardens, and related products. These fit within artistic and educational displays.
* **C: Karyakram cha mahina samma huna sakchhan** (Programs can last about a month) - The text states: ""Yea ghatanaharu samanyataya kahin pani tindekhi cha mahinaka bichma rahanchhan..."" (These events generally last between three and six months).



Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the passage."
Yea madhye vishwa mela wa antarashtriya pradarshan ko niyam kun ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Pradarshan le desh ko itihaas ra vishwakaa muddha haru dubai dekhaaunu parchha** (The exhibition must show the country's history and global issues).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sahabhagi deshharule sansarka samasyaharu wa tiniharuka deshka sanskriti ra itihas dekhauna rashtriya stambhaharuma kalatmak ra shaikshik pradarshanharu prastut garchhan.""  This directly translates to ""Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to show the world's problems and their country's culture and history."" This is the core rule/purpose of a World Expo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eutai deshle vaarshik rupmaa karyakram ko ayojana garna paudaina** (One country cannot organize the program annually) - The passage says they *could* happen annually in theory, but don't in practice. This isn't a *rule*.
* **C: Karyakram cha mahina samma huna sakchhan** (The program can be the same length as a month) - The passage says they typically last *between* three and six months, not necessarily *exactly* a month.
* **D: Mela ko aayojana huna sabai desh sahabhaagi hunu parchha** (All countries must participate for the fair to be organized) - The passage doesn’t state that all countries *must* participate.  It simply mentions participating countries.



"
Yea madhye ke garnale janawar ko akraman hune sambhawana kam rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Camp sthal baata fohor nikaalnale (Removing food from the campsite)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""tyasaile gandha yukta khana bokne wa pakaune karya nagarnuhos ra shivir safa rakhnuhos"" which translates to ""therefore, do not leave or cook food with smell and keep the campsite clean."" This directly addresses preventing animal attraction and therefore reducing the chance of attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sugandhamaya jadibuti boknaale (Leaving scented herbs):** The passage warns *against* using scented items.
*   **C: Bwaso bata 25 yard ko duri rakhnale (Staying 25 yards away from bison):** While maintaining distance is mentioned (100 yards for bears/bison, 25 yards for other animals), the passage emphasizes preventing attraction as a primary preventative measure.
*   **D: Janawar lai khana ko tukra haru diera (Giving food scraps to animals):**  This is the *opposite* of what the passage recommends. Feeding animals makes them associate humans with food and increases the risk of aggression.



"
Yi madhye kun kura anuchhedmaa jungli wanyajantu ko aakraman ko sambhawit karan ko rup maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Jungle wanyajantu laai khana dinu (Feeding wild animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns *against* feeding wild animals (""wanyajantuharu khuwaune wa tarsaune garnu hundaina""). It doesn't state that feeding them *causes* attacks, but rather advises against it as a general safety precaution. The passage focuses on maintaining distance, being cautious with smells, and respecting the animals' space as the reasons for avoiding attacks.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as potential causes/factors:

*   **A: kadha sugandha (Strong smells):** The passage explicitly states that smells attract bears and other wildlife (""key gandhale bhalu ra any wanyajantuharulai akarshit gardacha"").
*   **B: Duri kayam garna nasaknu (Not maintaining distance):**  The passage directly says not keeping enough distance leads to injuries (""Uniharule uchit duree nabanaunda pratyek warsha darjanaun agantuk ghaite hunchhan"").
*   **D: Manis sanga aparichiht janawar (Unfamiliar animals with humans):** While not explicitly stated, the general tone implies that wild animals are unpredictable and should be given space because they are wild and potentially dangerous.



Therefore, feeding wild animals isn’t presented as a direct cause for attacks in this passage, making option C the correct answer."
