"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe agaghị anabata ka okwu ọma kpọmkwem banyere ịgwu egwu akọdịọnụ?","The correct answer is **B: Debe nkwụgharị abaghị ụrụ n’akụkụ ịji jikwaa ume gị.**

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) directly advises against unnecessary movements with your fingers (""gbalịkwaa ghara emela ọtụtụ mmegharị ahụ na-abaghị uru n’iji ụmụ mkpịsị aka gị"") and emphasizes conserving energy.**  Option B echoes this by saying to avoid wasteful movements and focus on breath control (""ịji jikwaa ume gị"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maka ụda ọzọ, melite ike nke ị ji pikinye igodo** - The text *specifically* says you don't need to force keys to get louder, like a piano.
* **C: Gbaa mbọ hụ na ịna-apị notu dịka ịna-edebe aka gị nkeọma** - While important for technique, the text focuses on *energy conservation* and avoiding unnecessary motion, not simply playing notes smoothly.
* **D: Wegote ike iji apị beelo ịji nwetakwu nnukwu olu egwu** - This is the opposite of what the text says! The text explicitly states *not* to use force to get a louder sound.

"Ka iji akọdịọnụ egwu egwu, kedụ n’ihe ndị a ga-enye aka inwelite olu egwu?","The correct answer is **D: Welata nkwagharị mkpịsị aka** (Reduce finger movement).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""gbalịkwaa ghara emela ọtụtụ mmegharị ahụ na-abaghị uru n’iji ụmụ mkpịsị aka gị."" (and try not to make many unnecessary movements with your fingers).  It explains that excessive finger movement wastes energy and isn't necessary to achieve volume, just like on a piano. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tinyekwuo ọsọ** (Play faster) - The passage doesn't mention speed.
*   **B: Tinyekwuo ike** (Play with more force) - The passage advises *against* using too much force (""ghara imefu ike"").
*   **C: Welata nkwakanye** (Reduce breathing) - The passage actually talks about using breath support (""iji ọfụ ikuku ndị ahụ""), not reducing it.

Kedụ ihe kpatara eji egbupu akụkụ ihenlere dị n’igwe onyonyo egbupu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka ihenlere juputa n’ihu igwe onyonyo niile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""A na eme ya ka ihe ngosi wee juputa ihuenyo."" (It is done so the image fills the screen). This directly explains why the aspect ratio is adjusted – to make the image fill the entire screen of the TV.  The passage also mentions ""ovaskan"" which describes this process of filling the screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka anabata ideputa nwa isiokwu:** This doesn't relate to the reason for aspect ratio adjustments.
* **C: Ka anabata ntụgharị dị mfe n'ụdị ọzọ:** While conversion happens, the main *reason* for adjusting the aspect ratio isn’t for easy conversion.
* **D: Ka egbupu nwa isiokwu ndị nọ nsona mgbada:** This is a *problem* caused by the adjustment, not the reason *for* the adjustment. The passage explicitly states subtitles may be cut off.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee mmekpahụ mmadụ nwere ike ihu n’ịtụgharị ihenlere n’ụdị DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Ihenlere na-ejughị ihu igwe onyonyo niile**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mana ọ dị mwute na ị mee DVD, oke ya nwere ike ịpụ, ọ bụrụ na ihe ngosi vidiyo ahụ nwere edemede nkọwa nọ n'okpuru ihe ngosi, ọgaghị egosi ha nke ọma.""  This means the image doesn't fill the entire screen when transferred to DVD, potentially cutting off parts like subtitles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gbupụlata nwa isiokwu** (Cut off the main content) - The passage doesn't say the main content is cut off, just the potentially important subtitles.
* **C: Ihenlere na-asabasi ihe igwe onyonyo** (Image stretches to fit the screen) - The passage explains *overscan* which is the opposite - making things *too* large for the screen in the original TV format.
* **D: Gbupu akụkụ ihenlere gasị** (Cut off the sides of the image) - While parts might be cut off, the focus is on not being able to see everything due to the screen limitations of DVD format compared to TV overscan.

Olee ebe e nwere garịsọn Britain?,"The correct answer is **C: Bọdintaụn**.

The text states ""Ochịagha Jọn Kadwọlda ga ebuso ogige Briten agha mbugharị na Bọdintaụn..."" which translates to ""Colonel John Cadwalader would attack the British garrison at Bordentown..."" 

Therefore, Bordentown is where the British garrison was located."
Onye ka egosri mbinyeaka ya n'ime dụraftụ ejiri aka dee?,"The correct answer is **D: Chals Tọmsin**.

The passage states: ""Mgbe Kọngres nyechara ya nkwekọrịta ha na Julaị 4, e weere ya n'akwụkwọ eji aka dee, nke Jọn Hankọk Onye isi Kọngres na **Chals Tọmsin Onye odeakwụkwọ** tinyere akara nkwado ha...""

This means Chals Tọmsin signed the handwritten draft. Jon Dunlap printed the broadsides but didn't sign the original draft. George Washington and John Nixn were recipients/readers of copies, not signers of the draft."
"Na obodo ndị a, kedụ ebe Dunlapụ bịara ikpeazụ?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Otu kọpị ruru Lọndọn n'Ọgọstụ 10."" (One copy reached London on August 10th). This indicates that a copy of the Dunlap broadside ultimately arrived in London.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Niu Yọk:** While the declaration was read to troops in New York, it doesn't state that Dunlap ended up *in* New York.
*   **B: Ụlọ mbipụta akwụkwọ Dunlapụ:** This refers to the location where it was printed, not where a copy ultimately ended up.
*   **D: Họọlụ Nnwereonwe:** This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
Kedụ ebe ndị agha Kọlọnelu Stark dị?,"The correct answer is **B: Na bichi n'akụkụ mmiri**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndị nwoke Stark guzoro n'akụkụ nsu n'akụkụ ebe ugwu nke ọkwa Colonist."" This translates to ""Stark's men stood by the river on the western side of the Colonist position."" This clearly places them near the riverbank.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na mpaghara ngwụsị ugwu, n’ụzọ fensi** - The text doesn’t mention a fence.
*   **C: N'akụkụ ọwụwaanyanwụugwu nke peninsula** - The text mentions the *western* side, not the *eastern*.
*   **D: N'ihu fensi** - Again, there is no mention of a fence.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ oge ụmụ nwoke Starkị jiri gbatịa fensi ha?","The correct answer is **C: N'oge mbelata taịdị** (During the ebb of the tide).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mgbe ebili mmiri dị ala mepere oghere n'agịga mmiri Mistik..."" which translates to ""When the ebb tide revealed a gap in the Mystic River..."" This directly indicates that the men under Stark extended the wall during the low tide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka ndị Colony kpọrọ oku nkwanyeike** - The passage mentions the colonists calling for reinforcements, but this wasn't *when* they built the wall.
*   **B: Ka ndị omeihe gafere steki ahụ** - This doesn't appear in the text.
*   **D: Mgbe ndị agha kpebiri ịga n’ihu** - The passage doesn't indicate that their decision to build was based on a plan to advance."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n’okwu ndị a bukarịrị oge ọchịchị mkpagbu nke China?","The correct answer is **D: Oge Ọchịchị Alaeze Atọ**.

The passage specifically states: ""Oge ndị a nke a kacha mara amara bụ oge nke Alaeze Atọ nke mere ruo afọ iri na isii n'etiti Usoro Ndị Eze Han na Usoro Ndị Eze Jin ndị ahụ."" It also describes this period as one of upheaval and war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oge Ọchịchị Jini** - The passage mentions this *after* the Three Kingdoms period.
*   **B: Oge Ọchịchị Xi'an** - Xi'an is a city, not a dynasty or period of upheaval. It's mentioned as the location of the imperial palace.
*   **C: Oge Ọchịchị Han** - The passage states the Three Kingdoms period occurred *between* the Han and Jin dynasties, so it wasn't a period of upheaval itself.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, gịnị bụ eziokwu nke kọlọni antị ndị agha banyere ịbanye usoro nọmadiki?","The correct answer is **C: Ha na-arụ ebe obibi ha na-agbanwe ma ọgafechaa mkpụrụ ụbọchị 17**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ụmụ agbụsị na-agagharị n'abalị ma na-anọ otu ebe n'ụbọchị."" and ""Nke ọbụla n'ime ngagharị ike maọbụ ije ndị a na-aga n'ihu ruo abalị 17."" This directly supports that the ants move and establish a new ""home"" each day for 17 days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha rụrụ ebe obibi n’abalị:** The passage says they *move* at night, not build a home at night.
* **B: Ha nwere ntakịrị ụzọ ha si enweta nri:** The passage mentions a *trigger* for the move (food becoming scarce) but doesn’t say anything about *how* they get food.
* **D: Ha na-eme njem n’oge ehihie:** The passage specifically states they travel at *night*.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ezigbo edemede na-egosipụta agwa ebe obibi ndị kọlọni antị ndị agha n’oge usoro nọmadiki?","The correct answer is **C: Ha na-agbanwe ebe obibi kwa ụbọchị**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ụmụ agbụsị na-agagharị n'abalị ma na-anọ otu ebe n'ụbọchị"" and ""ò̀tù anụmanụ ahụ na-eme akwụ nwa oge nke a na-agbanwe kwa ụbọchị."" This directly translates to them changing their resting place each day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha rụrụ ebe obibi n’abalị:** While they *move* at night, the passage doesn't say they *build* habitats.
* **B: Ha mere njem mkpụrụ ụbọchị 17 na-agaghị ebe obibi:** They *do* stop and rest during the day, making this false.
* **D: Ha na-eji otu ebe obibi n’oge nilile nke usoro ahụ:**  This is the opposite of what the passage states – they change locations daily.



"
Olee n'ime ihe ndị a ga-adịgịde n'agbanyeghị ọbịbịa nke ndị nhazi otu ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Elekere bayolọjikul** (Biological clock).

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Elereke ime ahụ nwere usoro eje alọ nke na-arụ ọrụ n'onwe ya; usoro a ga na-aga n'ihu ma asịgodị rịị na onweghi ihe ọzọ metụtara ya."" This means the biological clock operates independently and continues even without external influences (like ""other regulators"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gburugburu mmebe ihe imeahụ (Tissue repair environment):** This is a process *affected* by the biological clock, not something that continues independently.
* **B: Ahịrịụda nkeoge (Spatial arrangement):** This refers to the physical organization of things and isn't described as continuing regardless of other factors.
* **D: Ahịrịụda nkeahụrụ (Physical arrangement):** Similar to B, this is about physical structure, not a self-sustaining process.



"
Kedu okwu bụ nkọwa ndị mmadụ egosipụtara ọdịịche nke otu omume nzipụta?,"The correct answer is **D: Nzịpụta nwere ọtụtụ ụdị**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mgbe ndị mmadụ na-egosi ọtụtụ ụdị nke otu agwa kpọmkwem ha bụ polimọfik.""
* **""Polimọfik""** means exhibiting multiple forms of a specific trait.
* **Option D** translates directly to ""Variation with multiple types,"" which aligns with the definition of polymorphism given in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nzịpụta nwere otu ụdị** (Variation with one type) - This describes *monomorphic* populations, the opposite of what the question asks.
* **B: Ihe ndị dị ndụ** (Living things) - This is too broad and doesn't relate to the specific concept of trait variation.
* **C: Ụdị ihe gasị** (Species) - This refers to a broader classification of organisms and isn't about variations *within* a population.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ okwu ziri ezi maka ihe ndị dị ndụ nọ n’otu mpaghara?,"The correct answer is **A: Nzịpụta nwere otu ụdị**.

Here's why:

* **Pọpụleshọn** (Population) as defined in the passage, is ""a collection of individuals of the same species in a particular area"".
* **Nzịpụta nwere otu ụdị** translates directly to ""a population with a single species.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngụpụta ndị mmadụ** (Human aggregations) - Too specific. A population isn't limited to humans.
* **C: Ụdị ihe gasị** (Species of things that died) - This refers to extinct species, not a living population.
* **D: Nzịpụta nwere ọtụtụ ụdị** (A population with multiple species) -  This contradicts the definition of a population, which requires individuals of the *same* species.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a abụghị ihe ọmụmatụ nke ọrụ njem nlegharị anya dabere?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịnọgide na mmirimwụda** (Staying in accommodation).

Here's why:

The passage describes eco-tourism as focusing on understanding nature and respecting the environment. The listed activities are all *actions* taken *within* nature (hunting, fishing, photography, observing wildlife, visiting parks to learn).  Staying in accommodation, while part of a trip, isn't an activity *of* eco-tourism itself – it's a logistical component.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of eco-tourism activities as described in the passage:

*   **B: Ịse foto ifuru ọhịa** (Taking photos of wildlife) - Explicitly mentioned.
*   **C: Ịga ebe ngosi iheochie nke sayensị** (Going to a science museum) - While not directly stated, learning about living things and the environment, as mentioned in the passage, would be facilitated by visiting a science museum.
*   **D: Ife igbu azụ** (Fishing) - Explicitly mentioned.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ihembido nke usoro ịga njem?","The correct answer is **B: Ụgbọ ala nkeonwe** (Private automobiles).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""otu sistemụ njem dabere na ụgbọala nkeonwe."" (a transport system based on private automobiles). This directly links private cars to the transport system being discussed.
* **The passage describes how travel impacts people and the environment.**  The core idea is about how the ease of travel (facilitated by cars) has changed life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebe njedebe ụlọ ọrụ** (Industrial work locations) - While related to the broader impact of travel, the passage doesn't center *around* factory locations.
* **C: Bayosfee kwụsiri ike** (Stable biosphere) - This refers to the earth's ecosystems, which are *affected* by travel, but not the system of travel itself. The passage states the current economic model is *disrupting* the biosphere, not that it *is* the system.
* **D: Evolushọn mmadụ** (Human evolution) -  While long-term travel *could* influence evolution, that's not the main focus of this passage, which is about the modern transport system.



"
Ụmụ irighiri ihe ndị na-agba nukulus gburugburu kedu ụdị chaaji onwere?,"The correct answer is **C: Chaaji negetivi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Elektrọn gasị nwere chaajị eletriki dị ọjọ."" (Electrons have a negative electric charge).
"
Kedụ irighịrị ihe mebere nukulus?,"The correct answer is **A: Purotọnụ na nuturọnụ** (Protons and neutrons).

The text specifically states: ""Neuklọs ahụ bụ ahụ ihe abụọ mejupụtara ya - neutrọn na protọn."" (The nucleus is made up of two things - neutrons and protons.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nuturọnu na Elekịtụrọnụ** (Neutrons and Electrons) - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are not *in* it.
*   **C: Elekịtụrọnụ na purotọnụ** (Electrons and Protons) - Same reason as above, electrons are not in the nucleus.
*   **D: Purotọnụ, nuturọnụ na elekịtụrọnụ** (Protons, neutrons and electrons) - Electrons are not part of the nucleus.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime edemede ndị a bụ ihe ọmụmatụ nke nọmba bayịnarị biti nke ise?","The correct answer is **D: 110101**.

Here's why:

* **Binary Numbers:** The passage explains that computers use binary numbers, which are made up of only 0s and 1s.
* **Bits:**  Each 0 or 1 is called a bit.
* **Five-bit Number:** We need a number that has *exactly* five bits.

Let's look at the options:

* **A: 1010** - This has only four bits.
* **B: 12001** - This contains the digit '2', which is not a valid binary digit.
* **C: 10010** - This has only five bits, but it is not the correct answer because it is not the only option with five bits.
* **D: 110101** - This has six bits.

Therefore, **D: 110101** is the correct answer.

"
Kedụ ihe ọzọ ana-akpọ dịgịtị bayịnarị?,"The correct answer is **A: Biti**.

The passage states: ""Otu akara ọnụọgụ abụọ nwere ike inwe naanị otu n’ime mbamuru abụọ, ya bụ 0 ma ọ bụ 1, ma a na-akpọ akara ndị a dị ka ọnụọgụ keọnụọgụ abụọ - ma ọ bụ **bits**, iji asụsụ mpụiche kọmputa.""  

Therefore, a digit in the binary system is also called a bit."
Kedu n'ime ndepụta ndị a ka ana-ekwughị n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a dị ka isi uru nke ịdere ụmụ akwụkwọ blọgụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Mwebelata nkatọ si n'aka ndị ọgbọ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The blogger then begins to attempt to refine their writing to avoid criticism."" This indicates a desire to *reduce* criticism, but it's presented as a consequence of blogging (to avoid it), *not* as a primary benefit of blogging itself.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as benefits:

* **A: Nkwalịte ụtọ asụsụ na ike odide (Improvement of language skills and writing ability):** The passage explicitly states that bloggers refine their writing due to feedback and the need to appeal to an audience.
* **C: Mmata gbasara gburugburu ebe obibi (Awareness of surroundings):** The passage says blogging ""encourages students to learn more about the world around them.""
* **D: Mmụba ọchịchọ maka ọganihụ mmụta (Increase in desire for academic learning):** The passage states that encouraging audience engagement ""stimulates students to become knowledgeable and engaged.""



Therefore, reducing criticism is a *motivation* for improvement stemming from blogging, but not a benefit *of* blogging itself as presented in the text."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-imeputa blọgụ ka akpọtụrụ ịji kpalite mmụọ ụmụ akwụkwọ iji kwalite nkà ide ihe ha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ịnwegide mmasị nke ndị na-ege ha ntị** (Considering the interests of the audience).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mkpa nke ịkwalite mmasị nke ndị nkiri na-akpali ụmụakwụkwọ inwe amamihe ma na-adọrọ mmasị..."" This directly links the need to cater to the audience's interests as a motivator for students to learn and improve their writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịzaghachikarị ihemmụta na ịntanetị** (Responding to comments online) - While mentioned in the passage, it’s presented as a *result* of blogging, not a primary driver for improving writing skills.
*   **B: Mmasị nke izere nkọcha** (Desire to avoid criticism) - The passage states bloggers *start* to improve their writing to avoid criticism, but this isn't a motivating factor *to* blog in the first place.
*   **D: Ịhụta mkpa mmekọrịta** (Recognizing the need for collaboration) -  Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging but isn't the main point regarding improved writing skills.

Olee na ndeputa ndị a na-abụghị uru mkparịtauka anaghị abịa otu mgbe maka ụmụ akwụkwọ? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mmekọrịta ihu n’ihu ndị nkuzi n'oge ọ bụla n'ụbọchị**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mkparịtaụka anaghị emekọta otu oge na-akwalite iche echiche ma zaghachi ndị ọzọ... Ụmụ akwụkwọ na-enye ndị nkụzi ajụjụ oge ọbụla n'ụbochị ma nwee olileanya inweta nzaghachi ọsịsọ, **karịa iche mgbe ha hụrụ ihu n'ihu**."" This directly contrasts the idea of waiting for face-to-face interaction with teachers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ị were ịntanetị ka ọbụrụ ụzọenyemeakaọrụ (Using the internet as a learning tool):** The passage *supports* the use of the internet for learning, stating it provides access to information ""mgbe nile"" (at all times).
* **C: Awa ịrụ ọrụ dị nwegharị (Flexible work hours):** The passage mentions flexible work hours as a benefit.
* **D: Usoro njikwa (Management systems):** The passage doesn't discuss management systems.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee na ndeputa anaghị abịa otu mgbe na adịghị ụmụ akwụkwọ mwegharị?","The correct answer is **D: Nrụọrụ ịntanetị (Internet Use)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how the internet allows learners constant access to information, enables students to ask questions anytime, and provides the expectation of quicker responses than traditional face-to-face interaction. This directly relates to the use of the internet in education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Usoro ịmụta akwụkwọ (Writing Process)** - The passage doesn't focus on how to write, but on *where* learning takes place and the benefits of that location.
*   **B: Awa ịrụ ọrụ (Working Hours)** - While the passage mentions flexible schedules, it's a consequence of internet learning, not the primary topic.
*   **C: Ihemmụta Ntụzịaka (Learning Styles)** - The passage doesn't discuss different ways people learn; it focuses on how the *medium* of learning (internet) affects interaction.



"
Kedu ihe ndị ana-emetụghị aka na mpaghara akwụkwọ a dịka ihe mmadụ ihe mmadụ nwere ike jikọta ya na kastụlụ midivalụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Shivalrị**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly mentions Shivalrị.** It refers to ""Atọrịan Shivalrị"" and connects it to ceremonies, feasts, and celebrations within the castles. This makes it a central element of the castle's historical and cultural context.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **Olulu dọnjịọn (Dungeons):** While dungeons are *part* of a castle, the passage doesn’t particularly emphasize them.
    * **Jọọstụ (Jousts):** Jousts *happened* at castles, but aren't a defining element of their original purpose or construction as the passage focuses on.
    * **Naịtị (Knights):** Knights are associated with castles, but aren't a structural or foundational element like Shivalrị, representing the culture *within* the castle.

The question asks for something people might associate with medieval castles as mentioned *in the text*. Shivalrị is the only option deeply intertwined with the description of castle life and the traditions it held."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emetụghị aka na mpaghara akwụkwọ dị ka ísì ma ọ bụ ụda nke nwere ike ịpụta n'agbata mkpoko kastụlụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụjọ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...nụkwa isi ụjọ si n'olulu ekuli"" (and hear the sound of fear from the surrounding ruins). This directly links the feeling of fear to the sounds and atmosphere within the ruins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọgụ (Battle):** While the passage mentions past battles, it focuses on the *feeling* evoked by the ruins, not the sound of the battle itself.
*   **C: Nri oriri (Feasts):** The passage mentions feasts/rituals associated with the ruins, but doesn't suggest their sounds are present within them.
*   **D: ikitiukwu anụmanụ (Animal cries):** The passage does not mention animal cries.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ nkọpụta ezie kpọmkwem nke Kastụlụ Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **D: A rụrụ ya iji nagide ogologo na mkpebi mwakpo di ike**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Windo ukwu ya e tere ihe na ahụaja ya tara ahụ ekwesịghị inwe ike igbochi otu mwakpo ekpebisiri ike ruo ogologo oge."" This directly supports the idea that it was built to withstand strong and prolonged attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lọọdụ Hastings yọrọ wọlụ kastụlụ dị ike** - The passage mentions Hastings *started* building it, but doesn't say he desired a strong castle.
* **B: Ọ chọrọ obere mkpụchi n'ihi ụdị udo obodo n’oge mwube ya** - The passage actually states the opposite - the castle was built as a defense *against* potential threats, even though the country was at peace.
* **C: Mwube nke kastụlụ abụghị ihe na-adịkarị maka oge ahụ** - The passage states the opposite - it was *more* substantial than most homes of the time.



"
Kedu n'ime atụmatụ ihe owuwu ndị a ka a ga-ewere dị ka Kastụlụ nke Kirby Muxloe n'oge akọwara n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntọala wuru iji kwado ọgụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nnukwu ụlọ Kirby Muxloe dịkarịrị ka ụlọ echekwara echekwa karịa otu nnukwu ụlọ n’ezie."" This means it was *built* to withstand attacks, implying a focus on defense.
* **The passage also states:** ""...Windo ukwu ya e tere ihe na ahụaja ya tara ahụ ekwesịghị inwe ike igbochi otu mwakpo ekpebisiri ike ruo ogologo oge."" While the windows *were* large, they were a weakness the building had to overcome with its overall construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nnukwu windo:** The passage specifically points out the windows were *not* a strong point.
* **C: Obere mgbidi karịa ụfọdụ kastụlụ:** The passage doesn’t compare the wall size to other castles.
* **D: Wọlụ girigiri:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.

"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, kedu ihe kachasi uru maka ọgbaọsọ na-akwado mmemme na-abịa n’ihu?","The correct answer is **A: Ịmụ ịgbaọsọ ngafe obodo n’oge sọma (Training for cross-country running during the cold season)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụfọdụ ịgba ọsọ n’ofe mba n’oge oyi, ejikọtara ya na ọrụ mgbatị ahụ maka akụkụ ahụ nke elu, bụ njikere kachasị mma maka oge agbamọsọ ahụ."" This directly translates to ""Some cross-country running in the cold season, combined with strength training for the upper body, is the best preparation for the racing season.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ịkpachapụrụ anya mmụta ikeọsọ n’oge ọzụzụ (Careful learning of running form during training)** - While good form is important, the passage doesn’t highlight this as *the most* valuable preparation.
*   **C: Ịnweta mmeri n’oge nkeji atọ (Achieving victory in three minutes)** - The passage talks about 15-minute and half-mile runs, not a 3-minute race.
*   **D: Iji jim nkeọma n’ịrụ ọrụ nke elu ahụ (Using weights to work the upper body)** -  While upper body strength training is mentioned, it's combined with cross-country running, making the combined activity more important than just the weightlifting itself.

Therefore, option A is the most direct answer based on the text."
"Ịsonyere mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee otu n’ime ihe ndi a dịkasiri mkpa maka ọgbaọsọ maịlị-ọkara klasị-iziz?","The correct answer is **B: Ịnwe mmasị ịnwe nnagide tinyekwuru ikeọsọ (Having strong endurance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes endurance.** It states ""...ntachi obi na-abụ ihe dị oke mkpa (endurance is extremely important)"" and ""...nnagide ka aga azuriri nime ihe mmeru-ahu obula (endurance must be developed in every training session).""  It clearly prioritizes the ability to withstand the demands of the race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịmụ ịgbaọsọ ngafe obodo n’oge ọnwa winta (Training for cross-country races in winter)** - While the passage mentions winter training, it's presented as *preparation* for the season, not the core skill.
* **C: Ịmecha na-erughi nkeji abụọ (Finishing in under two minutes)** - The passage mentions someone being able to run a half mile in two minutes, but doesn't state this is a primary goal for *all* runners. It's about individual ability.
* **D: Ịnwe mmasị inweta ike ọsọ karịa nnagịde (Prioritizing speed over endurance)** - This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests. The passage states speed is important, but secondary to endurance.



"
"Maka onye egwuregwu, olee n’ihe ndị a ka eneghị ike inweta naanị n’ihe oriri?","The correct answer is **C: Ikeọrụ ọmachancha**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Sọ oriri na-edozi ahụ agaghị eweta maka arụmọrụ pụrụ iche..."" (Correct nutrition will not bring about special performance). This directly indicates that nutrition alone can't guarantee improved performance.
*   The passage emphasizes that nutrition *contributes* to well-being and can *help* improve performance *when combined with* factors like good hydration and understanding supplements, but it isn't the sole driver of ""ikeọrụ ọmachancha"" (enhanced performance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikeọrụ akwalitere (Increased Strength):** While nutrition supports muscle building and strength, it's not the *only* factor. Training is essential.
*   **B: Obi aṅụrị emelitara (Elevated Mood):** The passage *does* mention that nutrition can affect an athlete's well-being and enjoyment, so it can positively impact mood.
*   **D: Ọdịmma n’ihe niile (Overall Wellness):** The passage *supports* that nutrition is important for overall well-being.

"Isonyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ n'ime ihe ndị a na-anaghị enye ndị egwuregwu nta usoro iji nwetakarị obi aṅụrị n’egwuregwu ha?","The correct answer is **D: Ịnwegide ikeonwe na-enweghị ọdịda (Maintaining consistency without setbacks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that supplements don't *directly* improve performance.** Instead, it emphasizes the importance of a good diet, hydration, and understanding supplements. Maintaining consistency, while important, isn't *directly* mentioned as a factor derived from diet or supplements to influence enjoyment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịna-eri oriri dịmma (Eating a good diet):** The passage *directly* links a good diet to improved performance and enjoyment.
* **B: Ịna-eme n’ikeọrụ onye ọmachancha kwa mgbe (Regularly engaging with a nutritionist):** Understanding supplements (mentioned in the passage) would involve working with a nutritionist.
* **C: Ịna-aṅụ mmiri n’otu dịmma (Drinking enough water):** The passage *directly* links hydration to improved performance and enjoyment.

Therefore, option D is the only one not explicitly stated as contributing to enjoyment in the passage."
"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ si kwuo, gịnị ka onye ọgbaọsọ nke etiti ji wee ike ịzụta igwe arụmọrụ dị ọnụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụ ihe nkeonwe ha ka mkpa** (It's a matter of personal preference).

Here's why:

The passage states that many items in the game have a *small or no* impact on performance. Players may still *like* certain items, even if they're not effective. This directly supports the idea that buying expensive equipment is a matter of personal preference, not necessarily a strategic advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O nwere uru e gosiputara** (It has proven benefits) - The passage contradicts this, saying most items have minimal effect.
* **C: Ọ ga-enyere ha aka nke ukwuu n’ikeọrụ ha** (It will greatly help them in their tasks) - Again, the passage says items often have no significant impact.
* **D: Ọ nwere ihe na abụghị ezi okwu banyere igwe arụmọrụ na adịghị ọnụ** (It has true and untrue things about performance equipment that are not cheap) - While this *could* be true in general, the passage focuses on the ineffectiveness of the items themselves, not the truthfulness of claims about them.



"
"Isonyere n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedu ịgba ọsọ ogo etiti chọrọ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọtụtụ igweọrụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""There are items that can be purchased as desired, but many of them will have minimal performance impact or none at all."" This implies that the game requires a lot of in-game effort (""items"") even if those items don't significantly improve your abilities. 
* **""Ọtụtụ igweọrụ""** translates to ""many efforts/tasks/grinds,"" which aligns perfectly with the passage's description of needing to acquire things even if they aren't essential.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ntọala egwuregwu nwere mgbọrọgwu** (A game setting with flaws) - The passage doesn't discuss the game's setting.
* **C: Igweọrụ dị oke nta** (Very little effort) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
* **D: Ọtụtụ ego** (A lot of money) - The passage specifically states it's a game that *doesn't* require as much money as others.

Onye chọpụtara rezọnansi magnetiki? ,"The correct answer is **C: Blochị na Purcellu**.

The text states: ""MRI dabeere na Nuklia Magnetik Rezonans (NMR) na fiziks, nke Felix Bloch (na-arụ ọrụ na Mahadum Stanford) na Edward Purcell (si na Mahadum Havad) chọpụtara n'afọ 1930 ga."" which translates to ""MRI is based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in physics, discovered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.""

While Damadian was crucial in developing MRI *as a medical imaging technique*, he did not discover the underlying principle of magnetic resonance. Bloch and Purcell did.
"
Kedụ n’afọ enyere patenti izizi rezọnansị onyonyo ahụike? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Afọ anọ gachara e nyere otu patentị, nke bụ patentị mbụ n’ụwa enyere na fịịldị nke MRI."" This means the patent was granted four years after Damadian's initial discovery in 1970.  1970 + 4 = 1974.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1977** - This is the year Damadian built the first whole-body MRI scanner, not when the patent was granted.
*   **C: 1930** - This is when Bloch and Purcell discovered the basis of MRI/NMR, not when the medical imaging patent was granted.
*   **D: 1970** - This is when Damadian made the initial discovery, but not when the patent was granted.



"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ, olee ihe ndị mmadụ kwesịrị ike na iji kọwapụta omume ana-ahụ anya ndị ọzọ?","The correct answer is **B: Nzube (Intentions)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the importance of understanding *what others are trying to achieve* – their goals, desires, and the reasons behind their actions.  This is what ""nzube"" means in Igbo. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmasị (Interest)**: While interest can *influence* behavior, it doesn't fully explain *why* someone is doing something.
* **C: Nkwenye (Belief)**: Beliefs are important, but they don't directly translate to observed actions. Someone can *believe* something without acting on it.
* **D: Nghọta (Understanding)**: Understanding is the *result* of figuring out someone's intentions. It's what you gain *by* trying to understand their goals.

The example of the person at the car clearly illustrates this – understanding their *intention* (to get into the car) is key to avoiding misjudgment.



"
"Isonye ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si kwu, olee ihe ịghọta ebumunuche na-enyere ndị mmadụ aka ime?","The correct answer is **C: Ị hụ ndị ọzọ ndị ọzọ na-ekpeghị ikpe** (To see others without judging them).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""It will help us to avoid misinterpreting their behaviors.""  Understanding someone's intent helps you *avoid jumping to conclusions* and judging their actions harshly. The example of the person at the car demonstrates this - instead of immediately assuming wrongdoing, understanding their intent (potentially locking the car) changes your perspective.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ị ji wepụ ihe amaghị ama dị n’omume ana-ahụ anya** (To remove ambiguity from observed behavior) - While understanding intent *can* reduce ambiguity, the passage focuses more on avoiding misinterpretation and judgment than simply clarifying actions.
* **B: I ji kwuo n’onwe ọchịchọ obi mmadụ** (To speak to someone's inner desires) - The passage is about *understanding* intent, not necessarily *expressing* it.
* **D: Ị gụ uche ndị ọzọ** (To read other people's minds) - The passage is about inferring intent based on observation, *not* about having psychic abilities. It's about making informed guesses, not knowing for certain what someone is thinking.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ nchikọta ọma nke uru AI?","The correct answer is **A: Ị hazi ịhe** (Problem solving).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that AI focuses on ""ịmepụta igwe ndị ga na-arụ ụmụ ọrụ ndị na-achọ amamihe nwere usoro"" (creating machines that perform tasks requiring intelligence). This directly relates to problem solving.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ị chọpụta olu** (Speech recognition) - The passage *mentions* speech recognition as an example application of AI, but it's not the core overarching benefit.
*   **C: Ị hazi oge** (Time management) -  While AI can *help* with time management, it's not a primary or defining benefit.
*   **D: Ị rụ ọrụ na nkeonwe** (Performing tasks independently) - This is a result of AI, but the *benefit* is what those tasks achieve – often solving problems.

Therefore, **A: Ị hazi ịhe** is the best summary of the core value of AI as described in the text."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ, olee ihe ndị a na-ejikọtakarị na AI?","The correct answer is **B: Ị hazị ihe na ị hazị oge** (Scheduling and time management).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that AI applications include ""njikwa, ịtụ arọ na ịhàzi oge"" which translates to ""scheduling, prioritization, and time management."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọrụ onye na-azụ ahịa** (Customer service): While AI *can* be used for customer service (mentioned as ""ike ịza ụmụ nchọpụta ọrịa na ajụjụ onye ahịa""), it's just one example, not a core association.
* **C: Fikshọnụ sayensi** (Science fiction): The passage acknowledges AI's presence in science fiction but clarifies it's a real and important field of computer science.
* **D: Ị chọpụta aka edemede** (Handwriting recognition): This is *an example* of something AI can do (""ịmata aka odide""), but again, not a central or encompassing association.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ike nke onye nwere ụdịdi echiche mgbakọ?","The correct answer is **A: Ịchọpụta ọtụtụ azịza nyere otu nsogbu (Identifying multiple solutions to a single problem)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes convergent thinking as focusing on *one* solution. It emphasizes narrowing down options to a single, correct answer.  Therefore, someone with a *divergent* thinking style (the opposite of convergent) would be skilled at generating *multiple* solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ị tinye n’ọrụ usoro ọhụrụ n’otu nsogbu (Applying a new method to a problem):** This is more aligned with innovation, but doesn't directly relate to the core principle of generating many options.
* **C: Ị weputa oge n’imezi nsogbu (Taking time to solve a problem):** The passage focuses on quick, decisive thinking - the opposite of taking a long time.
* **D: ị nweta usoro ibu ihe n’uche (Developing a mental framework):** While useful, this is more general and doesn’t specifically describe the *strength* of divergent thinking.



"
"Dika akụkụ akwụkwọ si kwu, kedu ihe enweghị usorouche ụdịdị echiche mgbakọ?","The correct answer is **B: Ị were oge mmadụ (Taking human time)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes speed (""ime ngwa ngwa"") as a key characteristic of this type of thinking. It’s about quickly forming a solution, leaning on intuition and established patterns.  Spending a long time (""were oge mmadụ"") would *contradict* this principle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịghọta na onwere naanị otu azịza ziri ezi (Understanding that there is only one correct answer):** The passage *explicitly* states that this is a core principle: ""ihe kachasị mkpa n'ụdịrị echiche a bụ: enwere naanị otu ụsa.""
* **C: Ị chọpụta okwu ziri ezi (Finding the right words):** While clear communication is helpful, the passage doesn’t prioritize linguistic precision. It’s about the logic process.
* **D: Ị kpokọta ozi (Collecting information):** The passage *includes* information gathering (""ichikota ozi"") as a component of the process.



"
"Ịsonyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ihe agaghị anabata dịka okwu dị nta?","The correct answer is **A: Ịna-elepu anya mgbe ana-ekwu okwu** (Avoiding eye contact when someone is speaking).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on *subtle* cues in facial expressions and body language that reveal truthfulness.  Looking away is a relatively *obvious* cue, often associated with dishonesty or discomfort. The passage is about recognizing much finer, almost imperceptible movements.

Let's look at why the other options are more plausible as subtle cues:

* **B: Ịna-akpali nku anya** (Blinking eyes) - Blinking rate *can* change with deception, making it a subtle cue.
* **C: Ịme nyụ anya ngwa ngwa** (Brief smiles) - Micro-expressions, like fleeting smiles, are precisely the type of subtle cues the passage discusses.
* **D: Iweli isi mkpịsị aka elu** (Raising eyebrows) - Subtle eyebrow movements can also indicate emotion or truthfulness.



The passage's emphasis is on movements measured in *milliseconds*.  Looking away is not this subtle."
Olee n’ime edemede a maka nkọwa okwu dị nta ziri ezi?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkọwa ziri ezi nwere ike ịchọpụta ịgha ụgha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...mmadụ nwere ike ịma mgbe mmadụ na atụ asi ma ọbụrụ na onwere ike ịkọwapụta obere mmegharị ahụ dị iche iche ọfụma."" This directly relates to the ability to detect deception (lying).
* **Option A** is true according to the passage, but it's a general statement, not about *micro-expressions*.
* **Option C** is also true, but it's a detail that supports the main point about detecting truth/lies, rather than being the main point itself.
* **Option D** is close, but the passage focuses on *detecting* deception, not necessarily analyzing someone's overall sincerity.



"
Olee n'ime ihe ndị a dị oke nweta uru karịa n'ihi Renayizansị? ,"The correct answer is **C: Nchetagharị edemede (Memorization of texts)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that before the Renaissance, memorization focused on *people* saying things.  The Renaissance shifted this to memorizing *texts* that were written down. This is a direct change described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nchetagharị mmadụ (Memorization of people):** The passage says this *decreased* in importance.
*   **B: Ịkesa amamihe (Sharing of knowledge):** While the Renaissance *did* lead to greater knowledge sharing, the passage doesn't specifically state this was the most significant gain. It focuses on *how* knowledge was retained.
*   **D: Ịnweta ozi (Access to information):** Again, the Renaissance likely improved access, but the passage is about the *method* of learning and remembering, not simply gaining information.



"
"N'ihi nke Renayizansi, olee ihe emetụtara obere aka n’ime ya?","The correct answer is **C: Nchetagharị edemede (Memorization of texts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ọ bụghịzị ịcheta mmadụ ka onye ọbụla na-ekwu okwu ya, kama ọ bụ ikikere ịcheta edemede ka etinyeziri uche."" This directly translates to ""It was no longer about memorizing people's speeches, but about prioritizing the memorization of written texts.""

The passage specifically highlights the *shift* in memorization *to* texts as a consequence of the changes brought by the Renaissance.  While the Renaissance impacted all the options to some degree, the passage focuses most on this change in how knowledge was remembered.



"
Olee ihe na-egosiputaghi mkpalite ịji intaneeti maka mmekọrita na-aga n’ihu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịjikọta azumahịa (Combining business)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""learning"" and ""social interaction"" as key motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995). Eighmey & McCord (1998) further highlight ""engagement"" and ""long-term relationships.""  All of these point towards personal and social uses.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Ya na ezinulọ ịnọkọ (Staying with family):** This falls under ""social interaction"" and could be a motivator.
*   **C: Ịnyocha ime njem (Researching travel):**  While internet is used for this, it's a *task* done online, not a core motivation for *why* people use the internet fundamentally. It's a result of internet access, not a driver of it.
*   **D: Ọgbakọ mmadụ ọhụrụ (Meeting new people):** This relates to ""social interaction"" and ""long-term relationships.""

**Ịjikọta azumahịa (Combining business)**, while a common *use* of the internet, isn't one of the foundational motivations presented in the text. The passage emphasizes *social* and *learning* factors, not professional ones. Therefore, it's the option that is *least* aligned with the motivators described.



"
Olee ihe na-egosipụtaghị mkpalite iji ịntanetị maka ntinye aka nkeonwe?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịlekwata ihe akụ na ụba**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses motivations for internet use like learning, socializing, involvement, and enduring relationships. These are all related to personal engagement and connection. 

*   **A: Ị le anya n’usoro (Browsing information)** - This relates to learning.
*   **B: Ịziga ozi n’ogwe mkpakọrita ụka n’intaneeti (Sending messages on online forums)** - This relates to socializing/communication.
*   **C: Ịme nchọpụta ngwaahịa njikwa ahụike (Searching for healthcare products)** - While specific, this could fall under learning or addressing a personal need.
*   **D: Ịlekwata ihe akụ na ụba (Gambling)** - This is a transactional activity driven by chance and doesn't fit the pattern of social or informational motivations discussed in the text. It's not about connection, learning, or relationship building.

Therefore, gambling is the option that *doesn't* represent a motivation for internet use related to personal engagement as described in the passage.



"

Here's why:

The passage states that the Western European style began to develop its own characteristics ""in the late 25 to 30 years"" of the period. This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mbịarute ngwụcha afọ nke etiti:** This is too broad and doesn't pinpoint the specific time frame.
*   **B: N’oge ọchịchị Bayizantin:** The passage states they *initially* followed Byzantine styles, but later moved away from them.
*   **D: N'ime narị afọ nke 11:** While this period falls within the timeframe discussed, the passage gives a more specific timeframe of 25-30 years towards the end of the period.



"
Olee ihe kpatara iji bọtịnụ ekechido uwe? ,"The correct answer is **A: Oge Gotiki**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Otu ihe mmepụta kachasi mkpa n'oge ahụ, n'ihi ọgụ aghara, ndị mmadụ bidoro iji bọtịnụ akpọchị akwa."" The passage is discussing the Gothic period, and links the adoption of clasps/buttons to that time due to warfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mgbe ọchịchị Bayizantin:** The passage says that Gothic fashion *started* by following Byzantine styles, but it wasn't the Byzantine era that caused the switch to buttons.
*   **C: Nnukwu Ọgbakọ Ekpere:** The passage doesn't mention any religious gatherings.
*   **D: N’Oge Afọ Nke Etiti:** While the Gothic period *is* part of the Middle Ages, the passage specifically links the button use to the Gothic period *within* that larger timeframe."
"Isonyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ, gịni n’ime ihe ndịa ka anabatara dika ihe ngwọta nwere ogologo oge maka nsogbu gburugburu ebe obibi?","The correct answer is **C: Ịmata ihe kpatara nsogbu ihe ahụ** (Identifying the root causes of the problems).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ọ bụrụ na anyị achọghị naanị ọsịsa nke nwa oge, ya mere anyị kwesịrị ịchọta isi ihe kpatara nsogbu ndị ahụ, ma anyị kwesịrị iwepụ̀ ike ha."" (If we don't want just temporary relief, then we must find the root causes of the problems, and we must remove their power.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịkwụsị nhọrọ ibi ndụ okomoko** (Giving up luxurious lifestyles): While potentially helpful, the passage doesn't frame this as *the* long-term solution. It's a potential consequence of addressing the root causes.
*   **B: Iheomume** (Protests): Protests can raise awareness but don't fundamentally solve the underlying issues.
*   **D: Ịbụ onye nkwado otu ịnvirọmentalụ** (Being a supporter of environmental organizations):  Supporting organizations is helpful, but the passage emphasizes the need to understand and *remove the power* of the causes, not just support groups.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe ndozi ndị a na-agaghị anabata ka ọgwụgwọ dị mma nke nsogbu ịnvịrọmentalụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ịwela isi ọnọdụ kpatara ihe ahụ** (Addressing the root causes of the problem).

Here's why:

The passage argues against merely treating the *symptoms* of environmental problems (like temporary fixes). It explicitly states the need to ""find the root causes of these problems, and we must remove their power.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịsonye n’iheomume** (Participating in events) - This is a symptomatic treatment, like the ""band-aid"" analogy in the passage.
* **C: Ịkwupụta echicheobi maka nhọrọ ụdị ndụ** (Expressing preferences for lifestyles) - While helpful, it doesn't *solve* the underlying issues.
* **D: Inọ ndụ na gburugburu ebe obibi n’usoro ịme obi ụtọ** (Living in harmony with the environment) - Again, desirable, but doesn’t address the fundamental drivers of the problems.

The passage’s central point is that lasting solutions require tackling the *causes*, not just the effects. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Olee mba ka agha mbụ e nwere na Europe bụ nke e kwuru na ọ metụtara nkwudosi ike nke ụkpụrụọchịchị kama inwe ihe gbasara okpukpechi?,"The correct answer is **D: Spein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Agha nnọchiteanya nke mba Spein gosiri agha izi nke nsogbu butere ya bu nhazi ike."" (The representative war of Spain showed the first war of problems caused by it was the balance of power).  This directly identifies Spain as the country where the first war driven by power dynamics (rather than religion) occurred.
"
Olee agha ana-akọwpụta dịka ‘agha okpukpechi’ ikpeazụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Agha Afọ Iri Atọ**.

The passage states: ""N'ihi nke a, agha alụrụ ahọ iri atọ ga abụ nke ikpeazụ akpọrọ agha okpukpe."" (Because of this, the Thirty Years' War would be the last called a war of religion.)"

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses the wealth and power of the Catholic Church**, mentioning how it accumulated wealth and how that led to questioning and even opposition. It states ""mkpọkọnata ike na ego a duru ọtụtụ ndị ịjụ sị ma a na-esokwa ụkpụrụ ya"" – which translates to ""this concentration of power and wealth led many to question and follow other principles.""

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: Ma ọbụrụ na aga-edeziwu isi usoro okpukpechi** (Whether the core doctrines of the religion should be revised): The passage focuses on the *application* of doctrines (helping the poor) and the *consequences* of the Church's power, not on whether the doctrines themselves needed revision.
* **C: Ntụkwasịobi nke ike n'ime Chọọchị** (The reliability of power within the Church):  Reliability isn’t the primary focus. The text speaks more to the effects of the power.
* **D: Ma ọ bụrụ na enwetara isi usoro nke Chọọchị** (How the core principles of the Church were obtained): The passage doesn’t discuss the *origin* of the doctrines, but rather their practice and the Church's influence.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, onye ka e gburu na Vasaillisi?","The correct answer is **D: Onyenche**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""N'otu mgbe otu n'ime ndị igwe mmadụ fegharịrị isi onye nche eze egburu na Versailles n'ihu eze nwanyi ụjọ ji."" This translates to ""At one point one of the crowd cut off the head of the king's guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.""

Therefore, the guard was the one killed at Versailles."
Olee ihe ndị a ka ndị obuọgbaghara a na-akwanyeghị Eze na Ezenwanyị mee?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmeghe windo nke obungwongwo ha** (Opening the windows of their carriage).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states, ""Ndị iwe a manyere Eze na Queen ka ha meghee windo ụgbọ ha."" (The mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage.) This is a direct action the mob *compelled* them to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ị site na Vasaillisi pụọ na mberede** (Leaving Versailles suddenly): The mob *caused* them to leave Versailles, but didn't do it *to* them.
*   **C: Nlele igbupụ isi nke onyenche** (Witnessing the beheading of a guard): They were witnesses to this event, but the mob didn't make them witness it.
*   **D: Njem ịlaghachi azụ na Paris** (The trip back to Paris): The mob *forced* the trip, but it wasn't something they *did* to the King and Queen.

Olee ihe mere n'ime edemede a na-abụghị maka agha ụgbọ mmiri enweghi isi nke Britain?,"The correct answer is **D: Enwetaghị ihe gasị dị mkpa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage details Britain's naval blockade of Germany, which was a breach of international law. It also mentions Germany's concern that Britain might do the same in submarine warfare. However, the passage specifically states that the *reaction to this event was minimal* (""Ebe nzaghachi ihe omume a pere mpe"").  This means nothing significant *happened* as a result of the blockade.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ebumuche Germani iso ụzọ agha nke amara** - While the passage implies Germany was trying to gain an advantage, it doesn’t directly mention a plan/scheme or strategy by Germany.
*   **B: Ụgbọ mmiri na-esoghi ka etinyere na nsogbu** - The passage states the blockade *endangered* neutral ships, but doesn't say they were actually put into trouble (e.g., attacked or sunk).
*   **C: A gbanwere iwu mba ụwa** - The passage states the blockade *broke* existing international law, it doesn’t mean the laws were changed.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the event didn't lead to any major consequences or significant developments."

Here's why:

* **The passage states the blockade *was* a danger to ships, even neutral ones.**  It explicitly mentions this as a negative consequence. It didn't *try* to ensure ships were safe, it *endangered* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O megidere iwu mba ụwa:** The passage directly states the blockade violated international law.
* **B: Ọ bụ ihe kpalitere agha sọbụmarini nke Germani:** The passage says Germany *feared* a similar action underwater, implying the blockade was a catalyst.
* **C: Ọ kpatara mwelata aka n’ibubata ihe nke Germani:** The passage says the blockade successfully prevented supplies from reaching Germany, therefore reducing their imports.

"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, onye ka enwere ike ịchoputa Ọtụtu Cerosisi?","The correct answer is **A: Nwanyị dị afọ 32**.

Here's why:

The passage states that women are *more than twice as likely* to have MS than men. It also states MS affects young adults and adults. 

*   **A:** A 32-year-old woman fits both criteria – she is female and in the adult age range.
*   **B:** A 15-year-old boy is less likely to be diagnosed given that MS is not common in children
*   **C:** A 43-year-old man is possible but less likely than a woman.
*   **D:** A 10-year-old girl is very unlikely to be diagnosed with MS as it typically affects young adults and adults.

Here's why:

The passage states that the study found feelings of *despair, fear, and catastrophic thinking* were among the effects of post-acute withdrawal on people with opioid use disorder.  It emphasizes these negative thought patterns (""iwebiga ihe ọjọọ karịa oke"") are more significant than the physical symptoms. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Azụ dị ala (Low mood):** While low mood can be *a result* of these negative thoughts, the passage specifically highlights *fear, despair, and catastrophic thinking*.
* **C: Obi ịju oyi (Anxiety):** Anxiety is related to fear, but the passage focuses on a broader range of negative thought patterns.
* **D: Ụjọ (Fear):** Fear is mentioned, but the passage also includes despair and catastrophic thinking, making ""negative thoughts about trauma"" a more encompassing answer.

This directly translates to ""the game is played in matches with a one-on-one competition format, one fencer fighting another."" This is the definition of a duel or a one-on-one match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N'ụzọ usoro ọhụrụ** (In a new way) - The passage doesn't mention anything about how the sport is played in a *new* way.
* **B: N'ogo mahadum** (At the university level) - While the passage mentions university students play, it doesn't say that's *how* the game is played.
* **C: N'ogo Olympiki** (At the Olympic level) - Similar to university level, it's a place where it's played, not *how* it's played.

* **The passage states:** ""Ihe ngosipụta ya, dịka ọgbụgbọ, bụ ihe ndị na-emekwa n'ọtụtụ ọrịa ndị ọzọ."" This means fever and blisters are symptoms of internal poisoning.
* The question asks for symptoms of internal poisoning.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tupu ị gaa lelee onye e merụrụ, i ga-ebu ụzọ nyochaa gburugburu ebe ihe mere iji hụ maka nchekwa gị."" This means checking the scene is the very first step.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Biakwute onye ihe metụtara** - You need to assess safety *before* approaching.
*   **C: Tụlee ọnọdụ onye ihe metụtara** -  You need to know the situation (from a safe distance) before getting close enough to assess the person.
*   **D: Chere maka enyemeaka** - While seeking help is important, it isn't the immediate first step. The first step is ensuring your own safety by checking the scene.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes prioritizing your own safety first.** It explicitly states to assess the surroundings for your *own* safety before approaching the injured person.  Ignoring the possibility of your own injury (A) is the opposite of what the passage advises.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tulee ebe ihe mere tupu onye ihe mere** - The passage *does* say to assess the scene first.
* **C: Lelee ọnọdụ onye ihe mere** - The passage says to assess the condition of the injured person.
* **D: Gbalịa ịhụ ma onwere fụlagị redi ọbụna** - While having a first aid kit is useful, the passage doesn’t focus on that as a primary step. It focuses on safety assessment.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""kama nhazi n'usoro nke ndị amị ga-adabere n'ogugo, ọ daberezie n'ikikere."" (instead of the organization of slaves depending on status, it depended on merit). This means the French Revolution shifted opportunities from being based on social class (ogugo) to being based on ability and effort (ikikere). This directly benefits ambitious and capable individuals.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Nkwalite nkwado maka obodo (Promotion of citizenship):** While the Revolution *did* promote citizenship, the passage highlights the impact on *opportunity for those already working*. This isn't the primary focus of the described benefit.
* **C: Nnabata omenala ndị Republikanụ (Adoption of Republican customs):** The passage mentions a shift to a republic, but doesn't specifically detail the *benefit* this brings to workers.
* **D: Sistemu nmekwa nha ọhụrụ (New assessment systems):** While systems likely changed, the passage focuses on *what* they were assessing (merit instead of class), not the systems themselves.

"Ịsonyere na Frenchi Revolushọnụ, kedụ ihe ọganihu ndị agha na ọrụ ndị ọzọ na-adịkarichaghị mkpa?","The correct answer is **C: Ebumnobi (Ambition)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights how the French Revolution opened up opportunities for people based on their *drive and success* – those with the most ambition were able to thrive.  It specifically mentions this in relation to both work (women gaining access to jobs) and social advancement (merit replacing birthright).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ihemweta (Ignorance):** The revolution was about enlightenment and challenging existing structures, not promoting ignorance.
* **B: Kụlasị (Class):**  The revolution aimed to *break down* rigid class structures, not reinforce them.
* **D: Mkpalite (Alliance/Support):** While alliances were important, the core change the passage focuses on is individual opportunity through ambition.



"
Olee ọrụ bu enweghị ihe n’obodo ndị mepere emepe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụdị mmiri (Flooding)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on complaints about transportation systems and, importantly, *flooding* and water issues. The passage asks why transportation systems lead to these complaints, and why they happen daily in open cities.  Flooding is the direct problem being complained about.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mmebe ogwe mmiri (Drainage blockage):** While drainage blockage *contributes* to flooding, it's not the fundamental problem the passage centers on – it's the flooding itself.
* **C: Ụgbọ ije njem ọha (Public transportation vehicles):** The passage mentions people *using* public transportation and complaining *about* it, but the core issue isn’t the vehicles themselves, it's the resulting water problems.
* **D: Agụmakwụkwọ (Education):** This is unrelated to the topic of transportation and flooding.

Here's why:

The passage specifically discusses complaints about public transport systems (ụmụ sistemụ njem). It asks *why* these complaints exist and *why* they happen daily.  Option C directly addresses this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye ọbụla na-eji hụrụ ha n’anya** (Everyone who uses them loves them) - The passage contradicts this; it talks about complaints, not love.
*   **B: Anaghị atụnyere njọ ka ụdị mmiri** (They are not comparable to water issues) - The passage *compares* complaints about transport to complaints about water/flooding, implying they are similar in frequency. This isn't a statement *about* the transport systems themselves.
*   **D: Ha na-enweta mwereonwe n'ọtụtụ obodo mepere emepe** (They are accessible in many open cities) - The passage mentions availability, but it's in the context of the ubiquitous nature of complaints *despite* accessibility.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fortunately, drivers have established patterns of behavior; therefore, traffic flow does not change randomly and can be represented by mathematical relationships."" It then says the relationships are based on speed, density, and flow.
* **The question asks:** What could complicate modeling *due to* a lack of rational driver behavior?
* **Usoro Tụrafiki (Traffic Patterns)** directly relates to the established behavior of drivers that the passage describes. If drivers *don't* behave rationally and predictably, it throws off the established patterns, making modeling difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tụrafiki Veloci (Traffic Velocity)** - Velocity is *part* of the modeling, but it's not the problem caused by irrational drivers.
* **B: Nhazi okporo ụzọ (Road layout)** - Road layout is a factor in traffic, but doesn’t address driver behavior.
* **C: Ọrụ okporo ụzọ gasị (Past traffic operations)** - Historical data might be useful, but again, doesn't address *irrational* behavior disrupting modeling.

Kedụ n’ime ihe ndị edesitara bụ nkọwa kachamma mgbe eji strimu matịmatiksi egosipụta tụrafiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmebe okporo ụzọ** (Flow of traffic).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""To better represent the movement of vehicles, relationships have been developed between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.""  It directly links these characteristics to mathematically representing traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọrụ okporo ụzọ gasị (Past Traffic Operation):** The passage focuses on *modeling* current traffic, not analyzing what *has* happened.
*   **B: Agwa onye ọkwọ ụgbọ ala (Driver Behavior):** While the passage mentions drivers have consistent patterns, it's the *result* of these patterns (the flow of traffic) that's being modeled, not the behavior itself.
*   **D: Densiti tụrafiki (Traffic Density):** Density is *one* of the three key characteristics, but not the overall representation of traffic using mathematics. The passage describes relationships *between* flow, density and speed.

Kedụ ihe Hershey na Chase jiri tinye DNA ha? ,"The correct answer is **D: Nje Virus gasị** (Viruses).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their DNA into a bacterial cell.""  This clearly indicates they used viruses (specifically bacteriophages) to deliver the DNA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Redioactivu phosphorusu (Radioactive phosphorus):** While they *used* radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA, it wasn't *how* they got the DNA into the cell - the virus was the delivery method.
* **B: Arụmọrụ genetiki (Genetic Engineering):**  Genetic engineering techniques didn't exist in the time of the Hershey-Chase experiment.
* **C: Redioactivu sọfọ (Radioactive sulfur):**  They used radioactive sulfur to label proteins, not to deliver the DNA.



"
Kedụ ihe Ikike nke muteshọnụ na-agafere nwa dabere?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụdị muteshọnụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the effects of a mutation, and therefore *what* is passed on to children, depend on the *type* of mutation, which genes it affects, and whether those genes are germline (in reproductive cells).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ma ọbụrụ na mkpụrụndụ dị n’usoro nje** - The passage does talk about germline cells, but the inheritance isn't *simply* whether it's in a germline cell. It's about the *mutation itself* within those cells.
*   **B: Ngosipụta nke arụmọrụ genetiki** - While mutations influence genetic expression, the passage focuses on the mutation itself being inherited, not just the resulting trait.
*   **D: Ma ọ bụrụ na muteshọnụ nwere ike ịkpata ọnwụ celu** - The passage mentions cell death as a potential outcome of some mutations, but it’s not the determining factor of *inheritance*.  A mutation can be passed on even if it doesn’t immediately kill cells.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the effects of a mutation *depend on* the **type of mutation** it is. It goes on to explain that different types of mutations have different outcomes (being passed on to offspring vs. causing cell death or cancer). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ihe ole arụmọrụ genetiki metụtara** (How many genetic functions are affected) - The passage doesn't focus on *how many* functions are affected, but *where* (germline vs. other cells).
* **B: Ma ọbụrụ na celu emetụtara dị n’usoro nje** (Whether the affected cell is in the germline) - The passage *highlights* this as a key factor determining whether a mutation is passed on, so it's something the effects *depend* on, not something they don't.
* **C: Ngosipụta ihe ndị arụmọrụ genetiki metụtara** (The expression of affected genetic functions) - While expression is related to genetics, the passage doesn't discuss how a mutation's effects depend on expression, but rather on the mutation's basic type and where it occurs.



"
Olee n'ime ihe ndị a akpataghị mere ndị mgbe ochie ji na-edebe ewu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha na-emekọrịta mmekọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ancient people kept goats for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides. While providing these things *is* a benefit, the passage also specifically mentions that shepherds (often children or young people) *tended* to the goats, creating a relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha na-enye ndị mmadụ anụ:** The passage states goats provided meat, but that's a *result* of keeping them, not the reason *why* they began keeping them.
*   **B: Ha na-enye aka ịgbuchasị ahịhịa n’ala:** The passage does not mention that goats helped clear land.
*   **D: Ha na-enye ndị mmadụ mmiri ara:** Like option A, this is a *benefit* of keeping goats, not the initiating reason.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the relationship between humans and goats, as exemplified by the shepherd, was a key part of the practice."
Kedụ ihe kacha nta bụ echicheobi nke gọlfụ iwere?,"The correct answer is **B: Stoku gasị**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Onye okpukpo piara ntakiri stroku ma obu fere klob obere karia mgbe o na agaghari n’ebe egwuregwu bu onye meririnu."" This translates to ""The player with the fewest strokes or the lowest score when moving around the course is the winner."" 

Therefore, the fundamental goal of golf is to have the *fewest strokes* to complete the course. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Bọlụ gasị:** (Lost ball) is a penalty, not the core goal.
*   **Oge:** (Time) isn't a primary factor in determining the winner.
*   **Oghere gasị:** (Hole completed) is a part of the game, but the focus is on how many strokes it takes to complete each hole.

The passage states: ""...a na-eme ahịhịa gbara olulu gburugburu, nke a na-akpọ griin, ka ọ dị mkpụmkpụ karịa."" ( ""...the grass is made shorter around the hole, called the green, so it is shorter."")  The green is the area where the grass is cut very short.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N’oghere nke iri na asatọ (On the eighteenth hole):** While the eighteenth hole is part of the course, the passage doesn't specify the grass is shorter *specifically* there.
*   **C: N’oghere nke izizi (On the first hole):** Same as above – the passage doesn't relate grass length to the first hole.
*   **D: N’oge ọkara izizi nke ọzụzụ (During the first half of the course):** The passage doesn't mention any variation in grass length over the course of the game.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""otu eksperimenti bụ otu ule nke eji ewepụ otu haịpotesis kwere omume ma ọ bụ karịa..."" This directly translates to ""an experiment is a test used to *eliminate* one or more hypotheses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka ewere mata ka usoro ụwa n’ ịrụ ọrụ** - While science aims to understand how the world works, a single experiment doesn't achieve this; it's a step *towards* understanding.
*   **C: Ka ewere kwado ajụjụ** - Experiments may inform questions, but their primary purpose isn't to confirm them.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the scientific method as a key part of scientific investigation.** This method *includes* hypothesis formation, experimentation, and analysis.
* **The question asks what *doesn't* help to bias scientific findings.** Simply observing what happens without the rigor of the scientific method (forming a hypothesis, controlled experiment, data analysis) is more prone to bias. You might see patterns that aren't there, or interpret things in a way that confirms your pre-existing beliefs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naanị usoro sayensị (Only the scientific method):** The passage *states* the scientific method is central to scientific investigation.
* **C: Ịna-ewepu hiyipotesisi nwere ike ịdị (Forming potential hypotheses):**  Hypothesis formation is a *part* of the scientific method.

*   **The passage states:** ""Ajọọ ifufe Tonedo na-efetu obere ebe ma ịtụnyere ya na ajọọ ifufe ndị ọzọ, mana ha nwere ike imebi ihe niile nọ n’ụzọ ha."" This directly contradicts option B, as it says tonadọsụ can destroy *everything* in their path, not less than other storms.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A:** The passage says “mana ha nwere ike imebi ihe niile nọ n’ụzọ ha” which means they can destroy everything in their path.
*   **C:** The passage states “Ajọ ifufe ndị kacha njọ bụ pasentị abụọ na-anọ karịa awa atọ.”
*   **D:** The passage states “Ikuku oke ifufe ndị a na-erucha 480 kilomita kwa awa (133 maịlụ kwa nkeji; 300 maịlụ kwa awa) n'ọsọ.”"

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ajọọ ifufe na-efetu obere ebe ma ịtụnyere ya na ajọọ ifufe ndị ọzọ, mana ha nwere ike imebi ihe niile nọ n’ụzọ ha."" This directly describes their destructive power over a large area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha na-emekarị ihe karịrị awa atọ:** The passage says the *worst* tornadoes last more than three hours, not that they *typically* do.
* **B: Ha na-emepụta ikuku dịka maịlị 480 kwa awa:** This is a detail about the *most intense* tornadoes, but doesn't characterize tornadoes generally.
* **D: Ha ga-abọli osisi na mgbọrọgwụ ya:**  The passage mentions trees being uprooted as *an example* of the damage they cause, not as a defining characteristic.

The passage explicitly states that the first telescopes were *developed* in Europe at the end of the 16th century.  The other options don't align with the information given in the text.

*   **A: I na-enyị enyoanya** (Looking at the stars) - People have been doing this for millennia, *before* the 16th century.
*   **B: I na-emelite ọbjektị** (Magnifying objects) - While telescopes do this, the question asks what people *started doing* in the 16th century.
*   **C: Ị na-emebe enyoanya** (Making lenses) - While lenses are *used in* telescopes, the passage highlights the invention of the telescope itself.



"
Kwuo oge ole ndị mmadụ nọ na-eji enyoanya emelite ọbjekti?,"The correct answer is **C: Ruo ọtụtụ puku afọ**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mmadụ anọwo na-eme ma na-eji anụ anya dị elu maka ọtụtụ puku afọ."" This directly translates to ""People have been making and using high-powered lenses for thousands of years.""

Therefore, people have been using lenses to improve sight for *thousands of years*.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Muhammad had a strong inclination towards secluded contemplation. He regularly retreated to the cave of Hira' for spiritual reflection. The description of the cave – isolated, offering limited views of the world, and promoting a sense of being cut off – emphasizes the *peace* and *solitude* he sought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ịme mkpọtụ ezi nwere ike nye ntụgharị uche aka** (Making noise can help with contemplation) - The passage implies the opposite; the cave was a place of quiet isolation.
* **C: Ọ chọrọ oge dị ntakịrị ịnọrọ onwe ya** (He wanted a little time to be alone) - While true, it doesn’t capture the *depth* of his spiritual practice as emphasized in the passage.  He wasn't just seeking alone time, but a specific environment for contemplation.
* **D: Ọ chọsiri ike ịhụ ya ma nụ ya** (He wanted to see and hear it) - The passage doesn’t state what he wanted to see or hear, only that his surroundings were limited to sky and mountains.

The passage specifically states: ""N'afọ 1767, e wepụtara wiil nke mbụ ejị igwe rụọ kpam kpam."" This translates to ""In 1767, the first wheel made entirely of iron was patented."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kụrọsutaisi (Cross ties):** These are the wooden supports alongside the tracks, mentioned earlier in the passage, but not what was first made of iron.
*   **B: Okporo ụzọ wagọnụ (Road wagons):** These are the carts themselves, not the component made of iron.
*   **D: Okporo igwe (Iron road):** This refers to the railway tracks, not the first iron component.

"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, gịnị mere eji were whilu igwe dochie anya whilu osisi?","The correct answer is **C: Ejiri ha wee buru nnukwu ibu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while wooden wheels only had wooden frames, they ""gave carriers the opportunity to reach more distant markets and haul much larger loads than the earlier, solid-tired roads allowed."" It then goes on to say that iron wheels were added to make the roads stronger, and eventually, iron wheels completely replaced wooden wheels. This progression clearly shows the shift to iron wheels was driven by the need to carry heavier loads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maka emelitere ikeọsọ ịnyịnya** - While improved roads were a result of the changes, the primary reason for the wheel change wasn't about improving the road surface itself.
*   **B: A hụtara na ha ka mma** - The passage doesn’t say they were simply ""better,"" but specifically that they allowed for hauling larger loads.
*   **D: Eji igwe dị na ya na-adọkasị n’okporo ụzọ ha** - The passage mentions the iron wheels caused wear on wooden wheels, not that they had better traction.



"
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ ihe mebere ndị mmadụ na mgbe nke Romantisizimu?","The correct answer is **D: Omenala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states that during the Romanticism period, people embraced tradition and customs because they felt more connected to those traditions than to imposed laws.** The passage highlights the importance of the relationship between people and their *omenala* (culture/traditions).
* The text describes a shift *towards* valuing established *odinala na omenala* (traditions and customs) as a response to feeling alienated from the laws imposed by authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iwu gasị emebere (Laws made):** The passage directly contrasts the appeal of tradition *against* the imposition of laws. It's the opposite of the answer.
* **B: Jiogụrafii (Geography):** While geography can influence culture, the passage focuses specifically on the acceptance of traditions and customs, not the land itself.
* **C: Kọstọmụ (Customs):** While related, ""Omenala"" is broader and more comprehensive than just ""customs.""  ""Omenala"" encompasses the entire cultural heritage, including beliefs, practices, and traditions. It's a more accurate reflection of the passage's focus.

"N'ime edemede ndị a, olee nke na-egosipụtaghị ebumunobi ziri ezi nke nkwekọrịta teknọlọjikụl? ","The correct answer is **D: Mmelite teknọlọjikụl agbasaghị ụkwụ na ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị obodo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that technological development *is* often independent of cultural or political influence. It argues that technology follows its own logic, and its impacts are often unforeseen and unrelated to initial intentions.  Options A, B, and C all align with ideas presented in the text:

*   **A:** The text demonstrates how human interactions (like more people owning cars) impact technological situations (road development, healthcare systems).
*   **B:** The text says technological advancement doesn't always follow a planned path. The road example illustrates this—building roads led to more cars, then problems, and *then* new technologies to address those problems.
*   **C:** The examples provided (roads, healthcare for accidents) clearly show how technology affects society.

Option D, however, contradicts the passage's core argument. The passage argues that technological advancement *does* often emerge independently of political agendas or cultural norms.



"
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee n’ime ihe ndịa na-adakọtaghị n’ịkpụlite ụta?","The correct answer is **B: Akara ihe dịka nke stepulu**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""ụta ala"" (downbeat) as resembling a step or a sunken place. The question asks which option *doesn't* relate to how to *play* the beat. 

*   **A: O nwere ụda dịtụ nro** - This describes the sound of ""ụta elu"" (upbeat)
*   **C: O nwere ụda sitụrụ ike** - This describes the sound of ""ụta ala"" (downbeat)
*   **D: Ịbido na frọgụ** - This describes how to play the ""ụta ala"" (downbeat)
*   **B: Akara ihe dịka nke stepulu** - This describes the *shape* of the notation for ""ụta ala"" (downbeat), not *how* to play it.

Therefore, option B is the only one that refers to the *appearance* of the notation, not the *action* of playing it."
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee n’ime ihe ndịa ka ya na ụda dị juu n’adakọrịta ?","The correct answer is **C: Akara ana-ele dịka V**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Akara “ụta elu” ahụ yiri otu V ma akara “ụta ala” ahụ yiri otu stepụlụ..."".  It also says the ""ụta elu"" (the V-shaped mark) produces a softer, higher sound.  The question asks which element correlates with a higher pitch. Therefore, the V-shaped mark (ụta elu) is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akara ụta dị ala:**  The passage explicitly links low marks to lower, stronger sounds.
*   **B: Ịdọlite ụta:** This refers to drawing the note, not the pitch itself.
*   **D: Ịbido n’ebe aka gị na-ejigide ụta:** This is how you play ""ụta ala"" which is associated with a lower sound."
Fọsilụ na-egosi n’aka mechara ka ejiri ya mee ihe maka nke gịnị na ndịa?,"The correct answer is **A: Nrụghari (Manipulation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aka na ukwu adaka ahụ yiri na nha na ogologo, na-egosi ojiji aka ya maka ibute ibu nọ n'ime ije njikọ mkpịsịaka. Aka mmadụ dị mkpụmkpụ karịa ụkwụ, ya na ụmụ ọkpụkpọ mkpịsị aka kara kwụ ọtụ. Ụmụ ọkpụkpọ aka fosil gbara afọ nde abuo rue nde ato na-ekpughe ngbanwe a na ọkachamara nke aka ahụ site na ngagharị rue mmegharị.""

* This translates to: ""The hands and feet of early hominids were similar in size and length, suggesting the use of the hand for carrying objects within knuckle-walking. The human hand is shorter than the foot, with flexible finger joints. Fossil finger bones from 2 to 3 million years ago reveal this change in hand specialization from locomotion to **manipulation**.""

The passage specifically highlights the transition from using hands for locomotion (walking/climbing) to using them for *manipulation* – which means skillfully handling objects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ịnagịde ibu (Carrying weight):** While early hominids used their hands for carrying, the passage emphasizes the *specialization* towards finer manipulation *after* the initial ability to carry.
* **C: Ntụgharị (Turning):** This isn’t a primary function of hands described in the passage.
* **D: Ịgba ụkwụ (Walking):** The passage states hominids *stopped* relying on their hands for walking.

Gịnị n'ime ndị a edesitara kọwara n’ezie ọkpụkpụ mkpịsịaka na mkpụrụkwụ nke chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Eji ha anagide ibu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Aka na ukwu adaka ahụ yiri na nha na ogologo, na-egosi ojiji aka ya maka ibute ibu nọ n'ime ije njikọ mkpịsịaka."" This directly links the structure of hominid fingers (and by extension, chimpanzee fingers as they evolved from a common ancestor) to gripping and carrying things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha gbatịkarịrị nke ndị mmadị:** The passage states human fingers are *shorter* than their feet, and chimpanzee/hominid fingers were initially similar in length to their feet.
*   **B: Nha aka na ụkwụ ha abụghị otu:** While true of humans now, the passage emphasizes that early hominids (and therefore chimpanzees) had hands and feet *similar* in length.
*   **D: Ihe mbu eji ha eme bụ nrụgharị:** The passage says the shift was *from* using hands for locomotion *to* manipulation, not that locomotion was the initial purpose.



"
Kedụ ọdọ mmiri nke nhọrọ na-ewepụ varieshọnụ genetiki ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Nke zoro ezo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nhọpụta na-ewepụ ya n'ogwu ọdịdị nke a kọwapụtara"" and earlier mentions ""ụdịrị genetik variyeshọn abụọ: nke zoro ezo na nke pụtara apụta"".  The passage implies that selection *removes* the novel genetic variations. Since ""nke zoro ezo"" (the hidden/less visible one) is the type that is not readily apparent, it's logical that selection would act to eliminate it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nke nchikọgharịta:** This doesn't align with the passage's description of selection acting on variations.
*   **C: Nke Nkewa:**  This refers to the splitting and shifting of populations, not what selection removes.
*   **D: Nke ekwuru:** This refers to the obvious/apparent variation.  If it's obvious, selection would be less likely to ""remove"" it without already having acted upon it.



"
Kedụ usoro eji agbakwụnye varieshọnụ genetiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Muteshọnụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mgbanwe n'ọdịdị na-agbakwunye ọdịdị kejenetiki ọhụrụ..."" (Changes in form add new genetic varieties...)
* **Mutation** is the process that *creates* new genetic variation. It's a change in the DNA sequence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nke Nkewa (Fission/Division):** Division (like cell division) *passes on* genetic material, it doesn't create new variations.
* **B: Nke nchikọgharịta (Recombination):** Recombination *shuffles* existing genetic variation, it doesn't create it from scratch.
* **D: Nke ekwuru (The stated):** This isn't a biological process.

This translates to: ""The quickest source would be protein found in leaves and cooked legumes, but these are difficult for humans like us to digest and require cooking.  On the other hand, animal foods (meat, insects, fish) are not easy, but they provide high protein with all the necessary amino acids.""

The passage specifically highlights **insects (igwurube)** as a readily available, high-quality protein source, contrasting it with the difficulty of obtaining sufficient protein from plants alone. The other options are either raw/uncooked plant matter (A & B) or a type of flour (D) not specifically mentioned as a good protein source in the passage.



"
"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee nsogbu bụ nke enweghị amino acidi na-akpata ?","The correct answer is **D: Ọnwụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ị jụ ime ihe a nwere nnukwu ntaramahụhụ: nnukwu ndamụmbà, ọtịtaahụ, **nakwa ọnwụ n'ikpeazụ**."" This directly links not getting enough of the necessary amino acids (by not eating meat) to eventual death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihe gbasara mgbaza nri:** While the passage discusses diet, it doesn't specifically frame the problem as a broader issue of food availability. It's about the *quality* of the food, not the quantity.
*   **B: Erighi ihe oriri na-edozi ahụ:** This is related, but not the direct, ultimate consequence mentioned. Poor repair is a symptom, but the passage points to more severe outcomes.
*   **C: Etoghị uto nke ọma:** This is also a symptom of amino acid deficiency, but again, the passage highlights a more serious result – death.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...members of a cultural group often identify with their unity through a specific and recognizable common code, including clothing, behaviors, and language of expression.""

This directly supports the idea that cultural groups show belonging through *distinctive symbols* – things like clothing, behavior, and language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha na-agba mbọ ịsonye** (They strive to join) - While people *do* strive to join groups, the passage doesn’t focus on the *effort* of joining, but on how they *demonstrate* belonging once they *are* in the group.
* **B: Ha na-anakwere ntụziaka nke onye ọbụla nọha nso** (They accept the direction of anyone nearby) - This isn't related to how cultural groups display unity.
* **C: Ha na-anabata ihedịmma nke ọha** (They accept public compassion) - This doesn’t relate to displaying group identity.

Here's why:

The passage states that children develop understanding of race and racial bias very early, and that these biases can *influence behavior*. Specifically, it gives the example of children from marginalized groups who, once they become aware of how their group is perceived, may start to *act out* in school.

Therefore, if a child from a group with negative stereotypes is aware of those stereotypes, the theory suggests they are *more likely* to engage in behaviors that conform to those stereotypes – a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nwa ahụ ga-agba mbọ zere ịme ọmụme ọjọọ:** The passage doesn't suggest the child will actively *try* to avoid negative behavior, but rather that they might be *drawn* to it.
*   **C: A ga-ewezuga nwa ahụ n’ọnọdụ mkpakọrịtaọha:** The passage doesn't address intervention or placement in special situations.
*   **D: Nwa ahụ ga-ajụ ịsọ otu obere resịalụ ndị ọzọ:** This focuses on social interaction and isn't the core point about acting out as a result of perceived stereotypes.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that racial biases learned at a young age *affect academic performance*. The example given illustrates how children from groups that are negatively stereotyped may start to perform poorly in school *once they become aware of how their racial group is perceived*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Obere resialụ ha họrọ ka amata ha:** The passage discusses how children *are perceived* based on race, not how they choose to identify.
*   **C: Ka ha na ụmụaka ndị ọzọ si emekọrịta:** While social interaction is important, the passage focuses specifically on the impact of stereotypes on academic results.
*   **D: Nkọwa ha na-enye banyere resi:** The passage doesn't discuss the children's explanations of race, but rather the effect of external perceptions.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ụfọdụ [ụmụaka azụghịazụ] biri n’ime ọhịa na onwe ha"" (Some [feral children] lived in the forest on their own).  This directly describes a life lived independently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha na-enwe nkọritaụka dị omume** (They have sociable interactions) - The passage describes feral children as *lacking* social connection with adults and even peers.
* **C: Ha na-enwe ikike ịnọrọ onwe ha** (They have the ability to fend for themselves) - While they might *need* to fend for themselves, the passage doesn't emphasize a developed *ability* to do so.  Their survival is often precarious.
* **D: Ha na-enwe ịtụ egwu ọha** (They have fear of the public) - The passage mentions some showing ""ujo"" (fear) towards humans, but this isn't a consistent trait and isn't the defining characteristic of being a feral child.  Some show *no* fear, exhibiting animalistic behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Enweghị ụzọ mmekọrita na-akpatakwa omume ọjọọ:** While the passage mentions a lack of bonding, it doesn't state it *causes* bad behavior, just that it's a characteristic.
* **C: Omume ọjọọ bụ naanị ụmụaka ndị ha na nne na nna ha nọ:** The passage describes children abandoned by animals and living in the wild, so this is false.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ugbo oru bu ihe oru ugbo bu nke eweputara iji meputa nri ga ezuru ndi mmadu choro ya *ma obu ya na ulo ya*."" (Farming is work that produces food to satisfy people's needs *or for their own household*).  It also mentions many farmers practice subsistence farming (""ụdị nke onwe n'enweghị nke orire""). This highlights that a key aspect of farming, especially in the context described, is providing for the farmer's family's needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ịkọpụta ihe oriri a ga-eresị ndị ọzọ (Producing food to sell to others)** – While farming *can* involve selling produce, the passage emphasizes self-sufficiency and providing for the household.
* **C: Ịlegharanya n’usoro ọrụ dị elu ma na nnukwu ihe nweta (Looking at high-level operations and large profits)** – The passage describes a simpler, often subsistence-based form of farming, not large-scale, profit-driven agriculture.
* **D: Ịchọpụta mkpụrụ osisi dị n’ebe onye ọrụ ugbo si (Identifying seeds from where the farmer comes from)** –  Seed selection is a part of farming, but not a defining characteristic emphasized in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes farming as a natural process.** It mentions using saved seeds, adapting to the local environment, and simple methods to achieve the best yield.  This aligns with the idea of an ""organic process"" - something that develops naturally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A na-emelite nri site n’iji tekniki pụrụiche (Food is updated using special techniques):** The passage emphasizes *simple* methods, not *special techniques*.
* **C: Ndị ọrụ ugbo n-enweta ikikere ịkekọrịta ihe oriri n’obodo ha niile (Farmers receive permission to share food in all their towns):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about permissions or sharing. It focuses on the *production* of food.

Kedu n'okpuru ụdị njem nlegharịanya ka ịga musumu dabanyere?,"The correct answer is **B: Njem nlegharịanya ntụrụndụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Njem ntụrụndụ"" (Leisure travel) is when people go to places *very different* from their everyday lives to relax and have fun.  The description of beaches, theme parks, and resorts aligns perfectly with this definition. The question asks for the type of travel someone would go on to *relax and have fun*, which is exactly what leisure travel is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njem nlegharịanya azụmahịa (Business travel):** This is about work, not relaxation.
*   **C: Njem nlegharịanya omenala (Cultural travel):** This is about learning a place's history and traditions, as stated in the passage, not simply relaxing.
*   **D: Njem nlegharịanya nkezi (Average travel):** This isn't a defined type of travel in the passage.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that leisure travel is ""when people go to places very different from where they normally live their day-to-day lives *to relax and have fun*."" This highlights the primary goal of leisure travel: getting a break from daily routines and enjoying oneself.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ha ga-ama omenala obodo:** While cultural travel exists (mentioned as a separate type of travel in the text), it isn't the *defining* characteristic of *leisure* travel.
*   **C: Ha ga-ahụ okeala obodo dị mkpa:** This is a possible experience during travel, but not a guaranteed aspect of leisure travel.
*   **D: Ha ga-aghọta akụkọ ihe mere eme nke mba:** Again, this is more characteristic of cultural/heritage travel, not necessarily leisure travel.

This directly translates to remembering times when people acted *unconventionally* and it led to *positive outcomes* made people more accepting of new change. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I ga-enweta nghọta ndị omenala metụtara n’otu:** While understanding tradition is mentioned, the passage focuses on *deviations* from tradition leading to acceptance.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that remembering times people acted *against* tradition and how those actions led to positive outcomes makes people more accepting of new changes and directions for the church. This directly addresses and alleviates the fear associated with change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ịkwalite ihenrita uru (Promoting financial gain):** The passage focuses on understanding history and accepting change, not financial benefits.
*   **C: Ịchọta ebe dị mma n’otu ahụ (Finding a comfortable place in the group):** While a sense of belonging is important, the passage's main point is about grappling with past actions and moving forward, not simply fitting in.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""N'eziokwu, onweghi otu ihe dị mma ọmụmụ."" which translates to ""In fact, there is no one good way to learn."" This directly supports the idea that there isn't a single, correct, or guaranteed method of learning. It emphasizes the individuality of the learning process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụfọdụ ihe ndịahụrụ na ọmụmụ bara nnukwu karịa ndị ọzọ** - The passage doesn't focus on the size or importance of concepts, but rather the *way* we learn them.
*   **B: Ekwesiri ịlekwasị ọmụmụ anya sitena n'ihe ndị anyị kpebiri na anyị ga-ahụta** - The passage doesn't advocate for focusing solely on what we choose to learn.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""E nweghi otu ụzọ ka mma isi mụta ihe"" and ""Enweghi otu ihe dị mma ọmụmụ."" This directly contradicts the idea that *some* learning methods are better than others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that drinking a lot of fluids (like water or tea, which are diuretics) before bed can force you to wake up to urinate, disrupting your sleep and making it harder to fall back asleep. This aligns with the idea of manipulating your biorhythm to *avoid* easily falling back asleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Studying for an hour and a half before bed is likely to keep you *awake*, not make it harder to fall back to sleep once you've already been briefly awake.
*   **B:** Going to the bathroom and immediately returning to bed would likely *help* you fall back asleep.
*   **C:** Turning off your alarm and going back to sleep for 20 minutes isn't a disruption; it's just sleeping.

Kedụ n’ime edemed ndị a na-abụghị okwu ziri ezi banyere nkwụsi ụra?,"The correct answer is **A: O nwere ike ịdabere na bayorimu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes techniques to *manipulate* sleep**, such as strategically placing an alarm clock or drinking fluids before bed. It doesn't suggest sleep inertia is tied to your natural biorhythms – it's something you actively try to overcome.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **B: Ebumuche ya abụghị ịkpọlite gị n’ụra kpamkpam** - The passage specifically states the goal isn't full wakefulness, but a brief interruption.
* **C: Ana-ewere ọnọdụ usoro n'oge ụra ziri ezi gị** - The passage describes techniques to use *during* your normal sleep time.
* **D: Dịka ịkụlitechara, ebumunuche gị ga-abụ ịlaghachị n’ụra n’oge awa abụọ** - The passage indicates the idea is to wake up briefly and then fall back asleep.

"Dịka ụbụrụ na-agbalị ịkọwapụta ọtụtụ nrọ ugboro ugboro, kedụ ihe na-abawanye?","The correct answer is **B: Nha ike**.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent lucid dreams are tiring *because* they increase the time between different REM stages. It compares this to waking up briefly every 20-30 minutes during a movie – it disrupts restful sleep. The core idea is that the brain's attempts to become aware *within* the dreams is what's draining. Therefore, more attempts at lucid dreaming lead to more tiredness/fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọnụọgụgụ nke ọnọdụ REM** – The passage doesn’t say the *number* of REM stages increases, only the time *between* them.
*   **C: Ogologo nke ọnọdụ mchịkọlata** - This doesn't directly relate to the tiring effect described in the passage.
*   **D: Oge jikọtara ọnọdụ REM gasị** – The passage focuses on disruption *between* REM stages, not the total duration of them.



"
Olee n’ime edemed ndịa ga-enwekarị ọnọdụ ọjọọ n’ịkọwapụta nrọ n’ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Idakwasị na nkọwaputa nrọ (Increased frequency of lucid dreams)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent lucid dreams are tiring *because* they increase the time between REM sleep stages.  Lucid dreams are essentially periods where you are aware you are dreaming, and this awareness disrupts the natural flow of REM sleep. Therefore, more frequent lucid dreams (idkwasị na nkọwaputa nrọ) would logically lead to more disrupted sleep and more pronounced negative effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịwelata ogologo nke oge jịkọtara ọnọdụ REM gasị (Decreasing the total length of REM sleep)** - The passage states the problem is *disruption* of REM, not simply less of it.
*   **B: Ịwelata REM gasị kwa abalị (Decreasing REM sleep per night)** -  Similar to A, the issue isn't quantity, but the fragmentation of REM.
*   **D: Ịmelite REM gasị kwa abalị (Increasing REM sleep per night)** -  More REM sleep wouldn't be the cause of fatigue in this scenario; the disruption is the key.

"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ ka timu kọnveshọnal na timu vechụal si yie?","The correct answer is **B: Timu abụọ a nwere ọkwa dị iche iche nke pụrụ nwegharị n’ọrụ ha na-arụ kwa ụbọchị.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Ndịòtù òtù kedịnuche na-arụkarị ọrụ dị ka ebe nzute mbụ maka òtù ozugbo ha keanahụanya... Ha na enwekwuru ikike ichoro onwe ha karia ndiotu otu ha..."" This implies conventional teams are more bound by structure.
* **The passage also states:**  ""...Òtù anaghị ahụ anya ahụ na-ewube ọkọlọtọ maka onyeòtù ọ bụla."" This shows that virtual teams (referred to as ""otu anaghị ahụ anya"") have a higher degree of autonomy and flexibility.

Therefore, the key difference is the level of autonomy – conventional teams have less, and virtual teams have more. Option B directly reflects this difference in the level of flexibility in their daily work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn’t imply they operate at the same level. In fact, it suggests they operate differently.
* **C:**  While the “otu anaghị ahụ anya” involves leadership, it doesn't mean both teams share specifications with a management team.
* **D:** The passage specifically mentions the virtual team can meet at *varying* times in their city, suggesting they *don't* necessarily operate within the same time zone.



"
"Idabere n’edemede akwụkwọ a, olee akụkọ gbasara fisikal na vechual timu gasị na-ezighi ezi?","The correct answer is **D: Vechual timu ga-erita uru na nwegharị mpaghara oge.**

Here's why:

The text states that ""òtù kendịnuche"" (self-managing teams) and ""òtù anaghị ahụ anya"" (shadow teams) can meet ""na-ndabere n’oge na-adi iche iche nke obodo ha nwere ike njikwa obodo ha agaghi aghota ya"" - meaning they can meet at times and in locations their governing body wouldn't understand.  This implies a flexibility with time zones and location, a benefit of virtual teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ana-emekarị kọnveshọnal timu n’ogo dị elu:** The text doesn't address the hierarchy or status of conventional teams.
*   **B: A na-akpọtụkarị vechual timu tupu kọnveshọnal timu:** The text doesn’t mention which type of team is referenced first.
*   **C: Kọnveshọnal timu nwere obere ikike nnọrọonwe karịa vechual timu:** The text suggests self-managing and shadow teams have *more* autonomy than conventional teams.

Kedu n'ime edemede kọwapụtara ihe echiche ọdịnaya gbadoro ụkwụ n’apụghị ime?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọchicho dị n'ime obi** (Inner desires).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that content theories ""focus on the needs and/or desires individuals have that are believed to have been established and internalized as they matured.""  This directly refers to internal drives and desires.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọchịchọ ọhụrụ na-achakepụta na mgbe okenye** (New desires that emerge in adulthood) - While desires can evolve, the passage focuses on those established *during* development, not solely new ones appearing later.
*   **B: Ka gburugburu mmadụ si elughari nkpatụ ha** (How the environment shapes behavior) - This leans more towards external factors, and the passage emphasizes internal needs and desires.
*   **D: Ịghọta ihendị na-amasị mmadụ** (Understanding what motivates people) - While content theories *aim* to understand motivation, the passage describes *what they focus on* to do so – internal desires.

Kedụ ihe na-abụghị ọbjekti nke iwu nke ọnọdụ atọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịna-ekepụta ahịrị ntọala nke ebendobe isiokwu** (Creating foundational lines that frame the subject).

Here's why:

The passage (P) focuses on the ""rule of thirds"" and how it involves dividing an image into thirds both horizontally and vertically.  It then discusses *where* to place the subject – at the intersections of these lines or along the lines themselves. It’s about *placement* within a grid.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to the rule of thirds:

* **B: Ịna-ekeputa ndụ na ike n'ime foto** (Creating life and energy within the photo) -  The rule of thirds is a technique used to create more dynamic and visually appealing compositions, lending life and energy to the photo.
* **C: Ina-edobe isiokwu n'otu ebe dị mma** (Positioning the subject in a pleasing location) - This *is* the core of the rule of thirds - finding the optimal placement for your subject.
* **D: Ịna-emepụta usoro n'ime foto** (Creating patterns within the photo) – The grid created by the rule of thirds can help establish and emphasize patterns.

Option A, while helpful in photography generally, is not a core component or *object* of the rule of thirds itself. The rule of thirds doesn't start with creating foundational lines, it assumes they are *already there* to guide subject placement.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that a 35mm frame actually measures 36mm x 24mm, a slightly different ratio than the name suggests. It also mentions that many digital sensor formats have *adopted* this aspect ratio, implying it's a standard, but not necessarily a perfect match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ ka nọ na mbiputa (It is still in production):** The passage confirms 35mm film is still manufactured.
*   **B: Ọ bụ ụdịdị igwefoto dijital nabatara ya (It has been adopted by digital camera formats):** The passage directly states digital camera sensors have adopted the aspect ratio.
*   **D: Ọ bụ nke dịkasiri nweta na mba ụwa (It is the most commonly found photographic format worldwide):** The passage states it *was* the most popular film format but doesn't explicitly say it's the most common now.

"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, dịka ndị nrụpụtaihe na-emelitee ogo nke nmeụta enyoanya, olee ka e si kwalite ọdịmma nke enyoanya?","The correct answer is **A: Ha nwere ike enyoanya karịrị dị elu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that advancements in lens manufacturing have allowed zoom lenses to achieve image quality *comparable* to prime lenses. This means the quality of zoom lenses has *improved* due to better manufacturing.  Option A directly reflects this improvement – they are capable of higher quality images.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha ka dị mfe iwe rụọ ọrụ n’ọnọdụ ọkụ-dịala:** The passage actually states zoom lenses generally have *smaller* maximum apertures, making them *harder* to use in low light.
* **C: Ụdịdị foto ha dịka enyoanya nwere ogologo fokalụ lemti enwe mgbanwe:** While zoom lenses *do* offer variable focal lengths, the passage focuses on quality improvement, not just the variety of focal lengths.
* **D: Ha nwere fokalụ mgbagwoju anya dị ntakịrị karịa enyoanya purimu:** The passage states the complexity *is* a challenge, but improvements are minimizing the difference in quality; it doesn’t suggest zoom lenses have *less* complexity.

"Ịdabere n’edemede akwụkwọ a, kedụ mgbe eji achọ enyoanya mgbatiihe karịa enyoanya purimu?","The correct answer is **D: Ma ọbụrụ na ị na-achọ ọtụtụ ihemgbagwojuanya fokalụ** (If you need a variety of focal lengths).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ihe ọghọm dị na zoom lens bụ na focal complexity ya na ọnụọgụgụ lens elements kwesịrị ka ejiri ya nweta a range of focal lengths karịrị na prime lenses."" (The advantage of a zoom lens is that its focal complexity and number of lens elements should be used to obtain a range of focal lengths greater than prime lenses.)

This directly supports the idea that zoom lenses are preferred when you need flexibility in focal length.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ma ọbụrụ n’apachọ kachasị elu bụ ihe ka mkpa** (If maximum aperture is most important) - The passage actually states zoom lenses *typically* have smaller maximum apertures than prime lenses, making them less suitable when maximum aperture is critical.
*   **B: Ma ọbụrụ n’achọrọ elementi enyoanya dị nta** (If you want fewer lens elements) - Zoom lenses have *more* lens elements due to their complexity.
*   **C: Ma ọbụrụ na ị na-achọghị iji fụlashi na nhazi gbara ọchịchịrị** (If you do not want to use flash in low light) - The passage indicates the smaller aperture of zoom lenses makes them *harder* to use in low light without a flash.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Mysticism as a search for direct experience of the divine/spirit.** It's about personal connection and understanding, not *being forced* into specific religious doctrines or closed-off systems.  The emphasis is on individual experience and understanding, not rigid adherence.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **A: A na-enwe mmesi na-ịnweta usoro udo n’obi ụtọ nke amaghị ekere** - This aligns with the passage's mention of experiences that are ""blissful"" and ""joyful,"" and the desire for connection with something beyond understanding.
* **B: Ndịosiso Misticismi na-achọ ịmụta eziokwu nke mmụọ** - The passage explicitly states mystics seek ""understanding within the spirit"" or ""truth.""
* **C: Ndịosiso Misticismi nwere ike ịkwere usoro ndị ga-enyere aka ịzụlite nghọta ha n’ụzọ enweghị ntụpọ** - The passage mentions following ""certain ways of life"" and practicing ""disciplines"" to nurture the experiences they have.

Here's why:

The text defines Mysticism as focused on experience, insight, and understanding *within* a divine connection. It emphasizes positive experiences like joy, delight, and bliss.  The text does *not* connect Mysticism to misfortune or negative experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịna-achọ echicheobi n'ihe enweghị ntụpọ** (Seeking perfection in things) - While Mysticism can involve seeking deeper truth, it isn’t necessarily about *perfection* as such.
* **B: Ịna-achụso nghọtaobi na nkekọrịta, iheahụrụ mmekọrịta** (Pursuing understanding and harmony, relational experiences) - The text specifically mentions the importance of connection and relationship (mmekọrịta).
* **D: Ịna-achụsosi ike ime ịmata Chukwu** (Pursuing the power to know God) - The text explicitly states that believers seek experience and understanding *of* God/the divine.

"Dika esi dee n’akwụkwọ a, olee onye malitere otu oru ubi?","The correct answer is **D: Maori si na mainlandi** (Maori from the mainland).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ndị Maori si Polinesia kwagharịa n'igwe were n'apụ ndị Moriori obodo Niu Ziland, were guzobe ọha mmadụ na-arụ ọrụ ugbo."" 

This translates to: ""...the Maori from Polynesia migrated to New Zealand and displaced the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.""

Therefore, the Maori from the mainland (New Zealand) are the ones credited with starting agriculture.

This directly translates to: ""For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted the large birds called moas.""

Therefore, the first moa hunters lived in New Zealand."
Olee otu ịjị usoro Purelandi nke origami rụọ ga abara folda ahụ uru?,"The correct answer is **A: Folda na-anabata ịme ọtụtụ foldu n'otu mgbe**

Here's why:

The passage states that Pịọland origami was designed to help beginners and those with limited skill.  The key feature is that it allows *multiple folds at once*. This simplifies the process and makes it easier for those who struggle with complex folding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Folda enwela nka moto emelitere** - Pịọland origami is for those *without* or with *limited* skill.
* **C: Folda na-ekepụta origami nke nabatara foldu azụ** - The passage doesn't mention anything about reverse folds.
* **D: Folda agbaliala ya naanị otu ugboro ma ọbụ ugboro abụọ n’oge gara aga** - This doesn't relate to the benefits of the Pịọland method.

Here's why:

*   **P:** says the system was created for beginners or those with little experience. This directly contradicts option A, which states it's for experienced folders.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, as they *are* described in the text:

*   **B: Anaghị agbakwụnye foldu azụ n’usoro ya** - The text explicitly states it ""forbids the re-creasing of the same fold"" meaning folds aren’t repeated.
*   **C: Foldu ya ga-enwerịrị ebe amara amara** - The text indicates that ""all folds have designated angles"", meaning folds are precise.
*   **D: Ọ bụ usoro ka mma nke folda gasị nwere ntakịrị nka moto** - The text states it was designed to help those with ""little skill in the art."""
"Dika esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ebe ana-agbakwụnyeghị Civilizeshọn Valie Indusu?","The correct answer is **A: Na Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Harappan Civilization (another name for the Indus Valley Civilization) is named *in remembrance of* Harappa, because it was the first site excavated in the 1920s. This implies that the civilization *was* found at Harappa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: N’osimiri Sarasvati:** The passage discusses the possibility that the civilization flourished in the basin of the Sarasvati River but doesn't state it was *not* found there. In fact, it suggests it may have been.
*   **C: Na Mpaghara niile na ọwụwa anyanwụ ugwu Afghanistan:** The passage states the civilization *included* parts of northeastern Afghanistan.
*   **D: N’ọtụtụ Pakistan nke oge a:** The passage states the civilization *included* much of modern-day Pakistan.

Therefore, the only place mentioned where the civilization *was* found, not where it wasn’t, is Harappa."

    *   ""Mmepeanya Indus bụbu mmepeanya Afọ Ọla..."" (Indus Civilization was formerly the Civilization of the Bronze Age…)
    *   ""...ekwesiri ikpo ya Indus-Sarasvati Civilization..."" (it should be called Indus-Sarasvati Civilization…)

    *   ""Mmepeanya gara nke ọma n'ụsọ osimiri nke Indus..."" (The civilization flourished in the Indus River…)

*   Therefore, ""Harappan Civilization"", ""Indus-Sarasvati Civilization"", and ""Mmepeanya nke osimiri Indus"" (Civilization of the Indus River) are all names *used* for the civilization, as stated in the text.

*   ""Mmepeanya Ndagwurugwu Indus"" (Indus Bronze Age Civilization) is simply a descriptive phrase explaining what the civilization *was*, but isn't presented as a name the civilization is commonly *called*."

The passage explicitly states that ""many people will discover that working together is better for them, in the long run."" This highlights the long-term benefit of collaboration.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ị na-emezima ebumuche nke onwe:** The passage contrasts self-interest with cooperation, suggesting self-interest is *not* the long-term benefit.
* **C: Ị na-agbadosike n’ihe ga-abara onye nwere ntakiri karịa onye nwere ọtụtụ:** This isn't a theme within the text.

The passage explicitly states: ""...a ga enwerịrị ihe nrite n'uru dị nụ nke a ga eritenwu n'obere oge ma akpaa agwa ọchịchọ onwe naanị.""  This translates to ""...there must be an immediate reward for self-interest."" This directly links receiving a reward to acting in one's self-interest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N’ihe nkeonwe** (In private) - The passage doesn't suggest privacy is the key to receiving a reward.
*   **B: Na mmekọrịta** (In relationships) - While cooperation is discussed, the immediate reward is tied to self-interest, not relationships.
*   **C: N’ọdịmma ya na ndị ọzọ** (In the well-being of others) - The passage actually suggests that eventually people will realize cooperation is better, but the *immediate* reward is for self-interest.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mmefu ego n'agha nke ndị Amerịka mbịarachịwa na mmeri ndị Filipaị bụ nke ndị Filipino kwụrụ ụgwọ ya n’onwe ha."" (The cost of the American colonial war and the Filipino conquest was paid by the Filipinos themselves). This directly indicates that the Filipinos bore the burden of the war's expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị gọmenti Philippine** - While the Philippine government was involved, the passage states *the people* paid, not the government itself.
*   **B: Ndị ụlọ akụ Wọlụ Striti** - The passage mentions Wall Street benefited from the situation, but they didn't *pay* for the war.
*   **C: Ọchịchị colonial nke U.S** - The U.S. colonial government instigated the war, but the passage says the *Filipinos* paid for it.



"
Kedu oge bịara tupu afọ nke Templarsi?,"The correct answer is **C: Afọ Etiti Mmalite**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""High Middle Ages"" (the period that inspired the Templars) was from 1000-1300 AD. It then says the *Early* Middle Ages came *before* the High Middle Ages, and the *Late* Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages. 

Therefore, the period preceding the Templars' time (the High Middle Ages) was the Early Middle Ages.



"
Kedu oge bịara ka afọ nke Templarsi gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **A: Afọ Etiti Ngwụcha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Ọgbọ etiti nke ngwụcha sotere n'azụ nke gwuru ebe 1500."" ( ""...the Late Middle Ages followed, extending to around 1500."")  The Templars were dissolved in the early 14th century, which falls firmly within the Late Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Narị afọ nke 12** - The 12th century was *during* the High Middle Ages, the time of the Templars' rise, not after their end.
*   **C: Afọ Etiti Dịelu** - The High Middle Ages *preceded* the end of the Templars.
*   **D: Narị afọ nke 11** - The 11th century was even earlier than the High Middle Ages.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Roman doctors were skilled at **amputations to protect patients from gangrene.** This was a direct surgical intervention used during that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha na-eji ọtụtụ sedetivi dị iche iche agwọ nsogbu ngbasaahụ postu-traumatiki** - While the passage mentions morphine and scopolamine (sedatives), it doesn't explicitly state they were used for *post-traumatic pain*.
*   **B: Ha na-eji mmipụta nke mkpụrụ osisi herbane agwọ scopolamini** - The passage states scopolamine was *derived from* henbane seeds, not that the seeds themselves were used as treatment.
*   **C: Ha ji aterial clampu eme nrụgharị ọbara** - The passage says arterial clamps were used to *prevent* blood loss, not to repair it.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions Roman Medical Corps, emperor employing doctors, advancements in surgery (amputations, tourniquets) and knowledge of drugs (morphine, scopolamine) – these are all covered.
*   The passage **does not** mention the creation of teaching hospitals. It only refers to the first Roman Medical Corps for post-battle care, not ongoing medical education or a hospital system dedicated to training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mwube Medikal Kọọz (The creation of the Medical Corps)** - The passage explicitly states the start of the Roman Medical Corps.
*   **B: Ihenlereanya agha dị ọjọọ nke empaya (The empire's harsh war practices)** - While war *facilitated* some medical advances (necessity for battlefield care), the passage focuses on the *positive* medical progress, not the harshness of war itself.
*   **D: Onye emperọ ịnye ndị dọkịta ọrụ (The emperor employing doctors)** - The passage states Augustus started employing doctors.



"
Kedụ ihe ikikere ịhụ ihe dakwasiri na?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị ọgan sensorị sistemụ a na-ahụ anya** (The organ sensory system that sees).

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""Ọhụhụ, ma ọ bụ enwemike ịhụ dabere na ọganụ ahụ kesensọ sistemụ ọhụhụ ma ọ bụ anya."" This translates to ""Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the organ sensory system of vision or the eyes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ihe ndị a chọrọ n’oganizimụ** (Things required in the organism) - Too broad and doesn't directly answer the question of *what* enables sight.
* **C: N’ihi nkpatụ aka nke ụfọdụ wevu-lemti** (Due to the manipulation of certain wavelengths) - This discusses *how* we perceive color, not *what* allows us to see in the first place.
* **D: Ogo dị nwegharị nke acuiti** (Variable degree of acuity) -  Acuity refers to the sharpness of vision; it's a *quality* of sight, not what makes sight possible.



"
Kedu ihe varieshọn nke nhazi anya dị n'etiti ọganizimụ dabere na ya?,"The correct answer is **B: Ihe organism chọrọ** (What the organism needs).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ọdịdị nke dabere na ọchịchọ nke ihe ahụ dị ndụ"" (the form depending on the needs of the living thing). This directly indicates that the variation in eye structure is based on what the organism *needs* to see and do in its environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Na ikenkpatụ wevulemti** (In evolutionary adaptation) - While evolution *plays a role* in how eyes develop, the passage doesn't focus on the *process* of adaptation, but the *result* of adapting to needs.
*   **C: N’ọkwa nke acuiti** (In the level of acuity) - Acuity is a *result* of eye design, not the driving factor behind the variation.
*   **D: N’ihemgbagwoju anya nke organizmụ** (In the complexity of the organism) - Complexity isn't the sole determinant. A simple organism might have a highly specialized eye for its specific needs.

"N’isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee edemede banyere Sikhismu na-akọwaghị okpukpechi ka osi di?","The correct answer is **D: Ụfọdụ omenala ndị Sikhismi tinyere mkpọrọgwụ n’ okpukpechi ndị Hindu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ndị Sikh ga-agwa gị na okpukpe ha na okpukpe Hindu abụghị otu ihe, mana ha kweere na ọ bụ n'okpukpe Hindu ka nke ha si pụta.""  This means Sikhism *developed from* Hinduism, but isn't the same. Option D reflects this relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkewa ọchịchị dị n’etiti omenala Hindu kpatara Sikhismi:** While the passage mentions a split, it doesn't say it was a *political* division (nkewa ọchịchị).
* **B: Guru bụ mpaghara nwere ugwu na Sikhism:** The passage says Guru has a *special importance* in Sikhism, not simply that it's a revered figure. It also describes the function of Gurus.
* **C: Ndị guru iteghete sochiri onye malitere okpukpechi, Guru Nanak:** This is a true statement *based on the text*, but it's simply a fact *about* Sikhism, not something that explains how it differs from Hinduism.



"
"Ịsonye ka edemede a si dee, olee n’ime okwu ndịa ka anabatara dịka isi ihe nke sistemụ nkwenye Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Ebumunobi nke guru**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Sikh faith is called ""Gurmat,"" meaning ""the way of the guru"" and that ""Guru...holds a special significance concerning the tenets of Sikh belief."" This indicates that the concept of the Guru is central to the Sikh faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Omenala Hindu gasị:** While the text says Sikhism *emerged* from Hinduism, it doesn't define that as a core tenet of the belief system. Sikhs differentiate their faith from Hinduism.
*   **C: Ekwenyeghị nnabata okpukperechi India ndị ọzọ:** The text doesn't mention a rejection of other Indian religions, only its origins within the Hindu tradition.
*   **D: Ịsụ asụsụ Punjabi:** While Punjabi is the language of the term ""Gurmat,"" speaking the language isn't a core *belief* of the Sikh faith itself."
"Dị ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si kọwaa, olee ihe nwere ike siri ụmụaka nwere nsogbu nkpachapụrụanya ike nweta?","The correct answer is **D: Ihe ndị na-amasi ha ịme**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụmụaka n'arịa ọrịa ADD na-enwe nramahụ ịgbado anya n'ihe dịka ọrụ ụlọakwụkwọ, mana ha nwere ike ịgbado anya n'ihe ha n'enwe ọñụ ime dịka egwuregwu m'ọbụ ile onyonyo ụmụaka nke na-amasị ha m'ọbụ ide ihe n'enweghị ntụpọ.""  This translates to: ""Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on things they enjoy doing like playing games, watching cartoons, or writing without interruption.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ (Schoolwork):** The passage explicitly says they have *difficulty* with schoolwork.
*   **B: Ịgwu egwuregwu (Playing games):** While they *can* focus on games, it's not a universal experience for all children with ADD, and the passage highlights things *they enjoy* specifically.
*   **C: Ịlele katonu (Watching cartoons):** Similar to games, this is just one example of a preferred activity, not a general ability.



"
"N’isonye ka edemede si kaa, gịnị kpatara ụmụaka nwere nsogbu nkpachapụrụanya ji emekarị omume dị njọ?","The correct answer is **A: Iji welata hiparactiviti**.

Here's why:

The text states that children with ADD ""na etinye onwe ha na akparamagwa di-egwu, na aba n’ogu, ma na-ama ikikere ochichi aka n’ihu"" (put themselves in dangerous situations, are disobedient, and defy authority). This is directly linked to their impulsivity and hyperactivity, which are core symptoms of ADD as described in the passage. They act out as a way to release energy or act on impulses without thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iji nyere ha aka jikọọ n’ebe ndị ọgbọ ha nọ:** The text says ADD *hinders* social interactions, not helps them.
*   **C: Iji nweta nkpachapụ anya n'aka nne na nna ha:** While attention-seeking *can* be a factor in some cases, the passage focuses on impulsivity and hyperactivity as the primary drivers of the behavior.
*   **D: Iji kwalite ụbụrụ mmụta ha:** ADD is a *learning disability*, not something that enhances brain function.

"Igbakwasa ukwu n’ozi dị n'akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime okwu ndị a na-abụghị ọmụma atụ nke sikafoodim?","The correct answer is **B: Onyenkuzi SAT**.

Here's why:

The passage explains scaffolding as a *support* system to help learners with new tasks, like learning a new computer program or starting a new project. It uses the analogy of a scaffold in construction and compares it to a helper within software.

Let's break down why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

*   **A: Nkuzi mmụta na mbido egwuregwu kọmputa (Tutorials for beginning computer games):** These directly provide step-by-step guidance for a new task – exactly what scaffolding does.
*   **C: Usoro ọmụmụ nkeonwe (Self-paced learning systems):** Although self-paced, these systems often have built-in support, hints, and explanations—acting as scaffolding.
*   **D: Onyenchịkwa obere ligi (Little league coach):** A coach breaks down skills, provides guidance, and helps players improve – a clear example of scaffolding.

**Onyenkuzi SAT (SAT tutor)** is a form of instruction, but it doesn’t inherently represent the *supportive, temporary* nature of scaffolding. While a tutor might explain concepts, their primary role is often evaluation and preparation for a specific test, not breaking down a new skill into manageable steps within the learning process itself.

"
Kedu n'ime edemede ndị a na-akọwapụtaghị kpọmkwem echicheobi nke sikafoldim?,"The correct answer is **A: Sikafoodu nwere ike ime vechual**.

Here's why:

* **The text focuses on scaffolding as *support* within a learning process, like help features in software.** It's compared to a teacher or help features in Microsoft Office. It describes scaffolding as something *built-in* and readily available.
* **The passage explicitly states:**
    * **B:** ""Skafoldin abụghị usoro mmụta kama ọ bụ enyemaka na-akwado…"" (Scaffolding isn't a learning method but a support.)
    * **C:** The entire analogy to learning a new computer program or starting a new task implies scaffolding supports *initial* engagement in a project.
    * **D:** ""A rụnyechara Ihe nkwado n'ime ngwanro a…"" (Support is built into the application...) indicating added support at the beginning.

* **The text doesn't mention anything about scaffolding being virtual or having a virtual component.**  The examples are about practical, immediate assistance within a task. Therefore, option A is the one not explained in the passage.

"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee njimara MySpaci nwere ike ịbara ụmụ akwụkwọ nwere nramahụ ịgụ akwụkwọ uru?","The correct answer is **A: Kọstọmizeshọn (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E nwere ike ịhazigharị ya ka o nwee ike dị mfe ịgụ nakwa iji nnukwu ma ọ bụ obere agba dị ka achọrọ."" (It can be customized to be easier to read and to use larger or smaller fonts as needed.) This directly addresses helping students with reading difficulties by allowing them to adjust the page to suit their needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bụlọgụ gasị (Large number of users):** While a large user base is mentioned, it doesn't specifically help students with reading struggles.
*   **C: Otu adreesị weebụ (Single web address):** Ease of remembering the address is a general convenience, not a benefit for students with reading difficulties.
*   **D: Profaịlụ nde 54 (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is irrelevant to the reading experience.

Here's why:

The passage states the protests were *about* food prices and wage cuts. It doesn't mention Krushchev reversing those cuts.  In fact, the protests happened *because* of the wage cuts. The other options are all actions Krushchev *took* in response to the protests:

*   **A: Họpụta pụraimu minista ọhụrụ** - The passage states he installed Wladyslaw Gomulka as prime minister.
*   **B: Jiri tankị weghachi udo** - The passage specifically says he sent in tanks to restore order.
*   **D: Kwere n’ụfọdụ ọchịchọ ihe akụ ma tinyekwa ụba** - The passage states he conceded to some demands and gave increases.

Therefore, improving the wage cuts would have been something he was responsible for *not* doing, considering it was the cause of the unrest."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that differences in **ideology and culture** (Option A and D) caused friction between the USA and USSR after WWII. It also mentions differences in **political systems** (Option C) as a source of contention. However, the text *doesn't* mention any disputes over agreements about Germany.  It focuses on factors that arose *after* the initial alliance against a common enemy.

Therefore, disagreements about Germany is the only option that isn't directly stated as affecting the relationship between the USSR and the USA in the provided text."
Kedu n'ime edemede ndịa na-akọwaghị kpọmkwem ebumnuche nke izipu mkpali navu n’ahụ niile?,"The correct answer is **D: Izere iyi egwu ahụ nke ọdịnịhu**.

Here's why:

* **P** states the nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending signals throughout the body to ensure smooth blood flow and protect the body.
* **A: Ịwelata ngazu ọbara (Reducing blood flow)** - The text states signals *ensure good blood flow* - the opposite of reducing it.
* **B: Ijikwa ngazu ọbara (Controlling blood flow)** - The text directly supports this; signals ensure *smooth* blood flow.
* **C: Ịlekọta homeostasis (Maintaining homeostasis)** - The text explicitly states the system uses homeostasis and is about maintaining it.
* **D: Izere iyi egwu ahụ nke ọdịnịhu (Avoiding body injury)** - While the system *helps* avoid injury by allowing for quick responses, the text doesn't explicitly state this is the *purpose* of sending signals. The purpose is to maintain homeostasis and good blood flow, which *contributes* to avoiding injury.

Therefore, option D is the one not directly explained in the passage as a purpose of the nerve impulses."
Olee ihe enwere ike ịhụ na Platuu Giza?,"The correct answer is **D: Piramidi Ukwu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ala ugwu Giza...nwere ọtụtụ piramid (nke piramid ukwu bụ nke kachasị ibu), ọtụtụ ebe olili, ọtụtụ ụlọ ofufe nakwa oke Sfinks."" It then explicitly says the Great Pyramid was built for Pharaoh Khufu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tọmbụ gasị** - While tombs are *within* the pyramids, the passage doesn't say you can see tombs directly.
*   **B: Tempulu gasị** - Temples are mentioned, but not as the primary thing to see.
*   **C: Ihe ịtụnanya asaa niile** - The passage states the Giza pyramids are *one* of the seven wonders, not all of them.



"
Olee ihe bụ ọchịchọ obi nke Piramidi Ukwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka o nye Fero nsọpụrụ** (To honor the Pharaoh).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Arụrụ oke piramid iji kwanyere Eze Khufu zugwu"" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built to honor King Khufu"". This directly states the purpose of the Great Pyramid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While it *is* one of the seven wonders, that's a result of its construction, not the *reason* for its construction.
*   **C:** The text doesn't mention it serving as a landmark.
*   **D:** While it's part of a necropolis (a city of the dead), the pyramid itself was specifically to honor the Pharaoh, not just hold bodies. The tombs and other structures were for family and others."
Olee onye ma ihe maka onye asọnisti nke mebiri tempulu?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Strabo, a Greek historian, later recorded the name, which is why we know it today."" This directly indicates that Strabo is the source of the information about the arsonist, Herostratus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndị Efesos (The Ephesians):** They *tried* to erase Herostratus's name from history, they didn't know or publicize it.
* **B: Alexanda Onyeukwu (Alexander the Great):** While the passage mentions Alexander offering to rebuild the temple, it doesn't say he knew who destroyed it.
* **D: Artemisi (Artemis):** Artemis is the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not the arsonist.



"

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Mgbe Alexander mechara nwụọ, a rụgharịrị ụlọ nsọ na 323 BCE."" This directly indicates that the rebuilding occurred *after* Alexander's reign ended.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says Alexander *offered* to pay for the rebuilding, but his offer was declined.
*   **C:** Herostratus destroyed the temple, he was not involved in rebuilding.
*   **D:** The text specifically states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.



"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ afọ izizi spechie gara ije n’ụkwụ abụọ?","The correct answer is **A: Nde afọ asaa gara aga**.

The passage states: ""Sahelanthropus nwere ike ije ije n'ukwu abuo na nde afọ asaa gara aga."" (Sahelanthropus might have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.)

Therefore, according to the text, the earliest species potentially able to walk on two legs was Sahelanthropus, 7 million years ago."
Kedu n'ime spechie ndị a na-ejikarị ụkwụ abụọ aga ije?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erektus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that humans started walking upright (""kwụ ọtọ aga ije"") 2 million years ago with the emergence of *Homo Erectus* (""nwoke kwụ ọtọ"").
*   While *Australopithecus* showed signs of bipedalism earlier (4.2-3.9 million years ago), and *Sahelanthropus* might have walked upright even earlier (7 million years ago), *Homo Erectus* is specifically identified as the species that *began to walk upright* – meaning, it's the one most associated with habitual bipedal locomotion as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sahelanthropus:** The passage says *Sahelanthropus* *might* have walked upright, but it's not definitive and much earlier than the key development.
*   **C: Ọpụrụiche bipedalụ (Bipedal trait):** This refers to the *characteristic* of walking on two legs, not a specific species.
*   **D: Ọstralopitekus (Australopithecus):** While showing early signs of bipedalism, they did not walk upright *as* distinctly as *Homo Erectus* according to the passage."
Kedu ihe ndị agha mmiri Germanị na-agbalị imepụta n'oge WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịgbochi Britain ịnabata ndị mmadụ na ngwaahịa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the German naval forces were ""trying to stop this choke point"" referring to the American effort to transport men and supplies to Britain. This means their goal was to *prevent* Britain from receiving those resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịgbochi ngwaahịa ndị si Britain abịa** - The text focuses on Germany stopping things *going to* Britain, not things leaving it.
*   **C: Ịbufe ngwaọrụ n'ofe Atlantiki** - This is what the Americans were doing, not the Germans.
*   **D: Ịgbochi Amerika ịnabata ndị mmadụ na ngwaahịa** - The Germans were focused on disrupting the delivery to Britain, the ultimate destination.



"
"Dabere n’ozi e nyere n’edemede a, olee onye kachasi ịnwe ọganihu n'agha navalụ na mgbe Mgbasa Ozi Nọtụ Atlantiki?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị Britain na ndị Amerika**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Americans were trying to transport troops and supplies *to help Britain*. It also says that if the German naval efforts had succeeded in blocking this transport, Germany might have won against Britain. This implies the *success* of the American and British effort (getting supplies across) was crucial, and thus they had the upper hand in that specific aspect of the naval war. While the Germans *attempted* to block the transport, the passage frames the American/British effort as the one that had to succeed for the Allies to prevail.



"
Kedụ ihe na-adịghị nweta oge ndị Asịrịa mejuputara ịji cavalrị?,"The correct answer is **A: Sadulusu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Emepụtabeghị sadụl mgbe ahụ, ya mere kalvarị Asịrịa busoro agha n'elu azụ ịnyịnya ha."" This translates to ""Saddles had not been invented yet, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses."" Therefore, saddles were *not* available when the Assyrians began using cavalry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kurossbow** - The passage doesn't mention crossbows.
*   **C: Charọtụ** - The passage specifically says the Assyrians used chariots *before* cavalry, and the cavalry was a development intended to make chariots less useful.
*   **D: Amọọr** - The passage mentions arrows as part of the weaponry, but it doesn't state that they weren't available.



"
Kọwaa otu esi alụ ọgụ eji calvari alụ?,"The correct answer is **C: N’azụ inyinya** (On the backs of horses).

The passage specifically states: ""Kalvarị bu ndi agha na-alụ agha ịnyịnya"" (Cavalry are warriors who fight on horses) and ""kalvarị Asịrịa busoro agha n'elu azụ ịnyịnya ha"" (Assyrian cavalry fought battles on the backs of their horses).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N’ụkwụ** (On foot) - Cavalry *don't* fight on foot.
*   **B: Na-ejighi amọọr** (Without armor) - The passage mentions the potential for armour to protect the horses, implying armour was used.
*   **D: Iji obere ndị agha** (With few soldiers) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the *number* of soldiers."
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ebe ị na-agaghị ahụ ọkara citizimu Babilọn?","The correct answer is **D: Ịwebata aja n’ebenchụaja dị n’ime**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that only the high priest was allowed to enter the inner sanctuary (ebenchụaja dị n’ime). This means ordinary Babylonian citizens would *not* be found bringing offerings into that specific area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịwebata aja n’ogigeikpe tempulu** - The passage says people brought offerings (aja) to the temples.
*   **B: Ịga emume na tempulu pụraimari** - The passage mentions ceremonies and festivals were part of worship.
*   **C: Na mmemme n’ogigeikpe tempulu** - Similar to B, the passage speaks of various events within the temples.



"
Gịnị n'ime ihe ndị a ka e debere naanị maka ndị nchụaja?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebenchụaja gasị dị n'ime**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụlọ-uka n’otu n’otu nwere mbara-ezi ulo-uka ma nwekazie ime ebe nchuaja ebe nani onye-isi nchu-aja nwere-ike ibanye."" This translates to ""Each temple had a courtyard and a sacred inner sanctum where only the chief priest could enter."" This inner sanctum was specifically for the priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emume gasị** (Festivals) - The passage says festivals were *brought to* the gods, not exclusively for the priests.
*   **C: Mmemme gasị** (Ceremonies) - Similar to festivals, ceremonies were for the gods and worshippers, not just the priests.
*   **D: Zigguratụ gasị** (Ziggurats) - Ziggurats were part of the temple complex, but were a dedicated space to the gods, not exclusively for priests.



"
Kedu oge Eze Tutankhamun kpatara aha ọjọọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka-achọpụtachara ili ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ma ka o si dị, nchọpụta ebe olili ya n'afọ 1922 mere ya onye ịrịba ama."" This directly translates to ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous."" Therefore, his fame arose *after* his tomb was discovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka ezuchara ili ya n’ohi** - The text doesn't specify *how* the tomb was discovered, just *that* it was.
*   **B: N'oge ọchịchị ya** - The passage states he wasn’t considered important *during* his lifetime.
*   **D: Ka edeputechara ya na ndesita eze mgbe ochie** - The passage explicitly states he wasn't included in many ancient king lists.



"
Gịnị mere Eze Tutankhamun ji bụrụ eze Ijipt a ma ama?,"The correct answer is **C: Ozuzu ọtụtụ puku artifati n’ili ya** (The abundance of thousands of artifacts in his tomb).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that the discovery of his *untouched tomb in 1922* made him famous. It then goes on to detail the vast treasures – ""thousands of works of art made of precious metals"" – found *within* that tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nchọpụta nke ili ya na-enweghị mgbagwoju anya** (The discovery of his tomb with no mystery) - While the discovery *was* significant, the passage doesn't say it happened without mystery. It focuses on the fact it was untouched.
* **B: Ọnọdụ ya na ndesita eze mgbe ochie** (His position in ancient royal lists) - The passage explicitly states he *wasn't* prominently featured in ancient royal lists.
* **D: Ngosipụta ya na mgbe Ijipt ochie** (His representation in ancient Egypt) - The passage notes he wasn't considered a significant figure *during* ancient Egyptian times.



"
Olee ihe onye Grik na-ede uri Homer na-enwewughi ike ime?,"The passage does **not** state what Homer was unable to do. It only describes him as a poet who wrote the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*.

However, Homer is traditionally believed to be blind. While the passage doesn't explicitly state this, it is a well-known cultural association. Therefore, the most likely answer based on general knowledge associated with Homer is:

**B: Ịhụ ihe (To see)**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịnu ihe (To drink):** There's no information about Homer's ability to drink.
*   **C: Ịga ije (To walk):** There's no information about Homer's ability to walk.
*   **D: Ịkwu okwu (To speak):** He was a *poet*, so he clearly could speak!



"
Kedu onye Grik a ma ama nke a maara maka ihe ọzọ na-abụghị agụmagụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""Pythagoras was a mathematician and inventor, most famously known for his popular theorem about the relationship of the sides of a right triangle."" This clearly indicates he's known for something other than literature.
*   **Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes** are all described as writers or playwrights.

Therefore, Pythagoras is the only option listed who is known for a field outside of literature."
Kedụ ebe ndị ezinụlọ Hibru na-emefukarị ọtụtụ oge ha?,"The correct answer is **C: N’ime yaadị**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes a wealthy estate where family members engage in various activities. The line ""Ụmụ nwanyị siri nri na mbara eze; ụmụ ụlọ ahịa wụbụ naanị ọgụego mepere emepe na-elefe anya n'okporo ámá"" translates to ""The daughters cooked in the palace; the household servants sat only on open porches overlooking the road.""  A ""yaadị"" is a courtyard or open space often found within a larger estate, and this is where these activities would logically take place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'ime ebe ikuku dị (In the airy place):** Too vague and doesn't relate to the specific activities described.
*   **B: N’ime streeti (In the street):**  The passage indicates servants are *overlooking* the street, not *in* it.
*   **D: N’ime ụlọ (In the house):** While some activities happen in the house, the description focuses on outdoor spaces within the estate.



"
Olee ihe na-adịchaghị oke mkpa maka ezinụlọ Hibru?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụlọ obibi ha** (Their dwellings).

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes a wealthy family (likely Hibru, given the context of central/eastern European estates) where the house itself wasn't particularly valued.  It states “ulo ahu abachaghi uru” - ""the house wasn't considered valuable"".  The focus was on displays of wealth (women cooking in the courtyard, merchants displaying goods openly, building with stone) rather than practical housing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kụlaimeti ha** (Their climate) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the climate.
*   **B: Ụlọ ahịa ha** (Their shops) - The merchants *displayed* their goods, implying the shops were important for business, not something dismissed.
*   **D: Isi nrị ha** (Their food) - The women cooking lavishly suggests food was valued.



"
Gịnị n'ime ndepụta ndịa na-akọwapụtaghị ọdịiche dị n'etiti obodo Scandinavian gasị?,"The correct answer is **A: Akụkọ ihe mere eme**.

Here's why:

The passage states that there are many differences between the Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland) in terms of ""ndị, ndị eze, omenala, na akụkọ ihe mere na"". This directly translates to ""people, kings, customs, and **historical events**"".

Therefore, ""historical events"" (akụkọ ihe mere) is the element from the list that the passage explicitly states differentiates the Scandinavian countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ala (Land)** - The passage doesn't mention differences in the land itself.
*   **C: Omenala gasị (Customs)** - While the passage mentions differences in customs, it's part of a longer list including history.
*   **D: Mmadụ (People)** - Similar to customs, differences in people are mentioned as part of the list, but not as the single differentiating factor the question seeks.



"
Kedụ onye gara na mbụ na Greenlandi kpara ala?,"The correct answer is **A: Agbụrụ Ezkimo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""agbụrụ Ezkimo ebirilarị ebe ahụ n'oge ahụ"" (the Eskimo race already lived there at that time) when Erik the Red discovered Greenland. Therefore, they were there first."
Kedu otu ga-anabata ejighị oche eri nrị?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụmụ nwoke Rome bara ọgaranya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...where the poor and women ate their meals while seated, the wealthy preferred to have dining affairs where they would recline and eat."" This indicates that reclining while eating was a practice enjoyed by the wealthy men of Rome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụmụ nwanyị Rome bara ọgaranya** - The passage states women ate *while seated*, not reclining.
*   **B: Ụmụ nwoke Rom dara ogbenye** - The passage states the *poor* ate seated, not the wealthy men.
*   **D: Ụmụ nwanyị Rom dara ogbenye** - While the poor ate seated, the question specifically asks about *reclining* which was associated with wealth.



"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ nke emume ndị Romu mgbe ochie?,"The correct answer is **D: Efere toki a ṅara n'ọkụ**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the Romans' love for exotic meats like wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormice. It also details differences in dining customs based on social class. However, it *doesn't* mention anything about drinking roasted coffee. Coffee wasn't introduced to Europe until much later.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text:

*   **A: Ndị ọbịa bụ ogbenye na-eri nri n'oche** - The passage specifically states the poor ate while seated.
*   **B: Ịji ejula gasị eme apịtaiza** - The text lists snails as a delicacy.
*   **C: Ụmụ nwoke bara ọgaranya na-ehi n’ala mgbe oriri abalị** - The passage notes the wealthy enjoyed reclining while eating.

"Sitena ịdabere n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ihe ndị apụghị ịnwe mmetụta na-adịgide?","The correct answer is **B: Omenala dị obere (Small cultures)**.

Here's why, based on the provided text:

The text explicitly states: ""Ụmụ obere ọdịnala na-apụ n'anya na-ahapụghị ihe akaebe dị mkpa ya mere anaghị ahụta ha dị ka sivilaịzeshọn kwesịrị ekwesị."" (Small cultures disappear without leaving significant traces and therefore are not considered civilizations).  This means they don't have a *lasting* impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Obodo (Cities):** The text links ""civilization"" to the Latin root relating to cities and citizens.  Cities are a fundamental part of civilization and have lasting impact.
* **C: Steeti-obodo (City-states):**  The text mentions city-states as a form of community that influenced the concept of civilization.  They are a historical structure with lasting impact as a model for governance.
* **D: Omenala civilization (Civilization culture):**  Civilization *is* the thing that has a lasting impact. The text discusses what *constitutes* a civilization, implying its lasting nature.



"
"Olee ihe na-eso obodo, dika mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee?","The correct answer is **A: Omenaala kemmepeanya** (Complex culture).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Steeti-obodo gasị bụ obu ụzọ nke ụmụ mba. **Omenaala kemmepeanya** pụtara nnyefe nke ihe ọmụma n'etiti ọtụtụ ọgbọ..."" (City-states were followed by **complex culture** which meant the transfer of knowledge between many generations...). 

The text directly links complex culture as what *follows* the city-state.



"
Olee edemede maka Drukgyal Dzong na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **A: A rụrụ ya maka emume mmeri nke ndị agha Tibet-Mongol.**

Here's why:

The passage states Drukgyal Dzong was built *to commemorate a victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol armies, not *of* them. This makes option A factually incorrect based on the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: E hibere ya Bhutan** - The text confirms it's located in the Paro district of Bhutan.
*   **C: Ọkụ bibiri ọtụtụ ihe dị mkpa fọdụrụnụ** - The text explicitly mentions a fire destroyed a significant portion of the Dzong, including important statues.
*   **D: Ọ bụ Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel kere ya** - The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress.



"
Olee edemede kọwapụtara kpọmkwem ihe ọkụ kpatara na Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Onyonyo Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal bụ naanị ihe fọdụrụnụ** (Only the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal was destroyed).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""In 1951, a fire caused some of the property of Drukgyal Dzong to be destroyed, such as the image of Zabdrung Ngawang Namgial.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị agha Tibet Mongol meriri** (The Tibetan-Mongol armies won) - The passage says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *defeated* them.
*   **C: Emetụtaghị mma nke ọha aka** (Public beauty was not affected) - The passage states the Dzong was partially destroyed by fire.
*   **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel chekwabara ya** (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it) - The passage says he *commemorated* a victory by building it, not that he rebuilt it after a fire.



"
Kedu n'ime nkwuputa ndị a banyere Cambodia bụ eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị Thais bibiri Phnom Penh**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Na n'ime 1772 ha bibiri Phnom Phen."" (""In 1772 they destroyed Phnom Penh."") The ""ha"" refers to the Thais, as the sentence is about Thai-Cambodia conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị Vietnamese mebiri Phnom Penh:** The passage doesn't say the Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh, only that they invaded Cambodia at the end of the 18th century.
*   **B: Cambodia wakporo Thailand na 1772:** The passage states the *Thais* attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
*   **C: Ndị Vietnamese wakporo Cambodia na mmalite narị afọ nke 18:** The passage says the Vietnamese invasion happened *at the end* of the 18th century, not the beginning.



"
Olee ederede n'ime ndị a kọwapụtara kpọmkwem mwakpọ nke Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị Thais na Vietnamese wakporo Cambodia n’afọ 1772**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that the Thais attacked Cambodia many times in the 18th century and *in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Penh*. It also states that by the end of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.  This directly shows both Thailand (Thais) and Vietnam were involved in attacks on Cambodia, with 1772 being a specific event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says Vietnam *invaded* Cambodia, not just attacked many times.
*   **C:** The Vietnamese didn't destroy Phnom Penh, the Thais did.
*   **D:** While true, it only mentions attacks from the Thais and doesn't include the Vietnamese, making it incomplete.



"
Kedu ihe ụlọ ọrụ Dutch East India na-emeghị mgbe ha nọ na Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ha kpachara anya nyefee ọchịchị Quing nchịkwa nke Taiwan.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Qing dynasty *conquered* Taiwan from the Dutch in 1683. The Dutch did *not* willingly hand over control.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: Ha nwere ntọala n'akụkụ ndịda ọdịdaanyanwụ nke islandi** - The text says ""Ụlọọrụ Dọch Isti Indịa mepere ụlọọrụ na ndịda ọdịdaanyanwụ Taịwan"" (The Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan).
*   **B: Ha na-emepụta mkpụrụọka obodo** - The text states, ""bido mgbanwe n'otu e si emepụta mkpụrụ n'oge gboo"" (starting changes in how crops were produced).
*   **C: Ha tinyere ndị ọrụ China n'ọrụ n'ubi ya** - The text says, ""ma wee ndị ọkpọkọọrụ Chaịna ka ha rụọ ọrụ n'ugbo osikapa na nke shuga ha"" (and then hired Chinese laborers to work in its sugar and coffee plantations).



"
Gịnị ka Nkwekọrịta nke Shimonoseki mepụtara?,"The correct answer is **D: Ikikere Japan nwere karịa Taiwani** (Japan's acquisition of Taiwan).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, *through which it ceded Taiwan to Japan*...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọdịda Japan n’agha Sino-Japanese nke izizi** (Japan's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War) - The passage states Japan *won*, not lost.
*   **B: Ọnọdụ Taiwan ka provinci n'okpuru ọchịchị Qing** (Taiwan's status as a province under Qing rule) - The treaty *ended* Qing rule over Taiwan.
*   **C: Ikikere Taiwan nwere iji weghara nchịkwa n’ebe kostalụ gas** (Taiwan’s permission to take over coastal control) - This isn't mentioned in the passage and isn't what the treaty did.



"
Olee etu esi elele levulu pH nke kemikal?,"The correct answer is **C: Ole ion hayidụrogen na kemikal**

Here's why:

The passage clearly states: ""Nha nke ayọn Hydrogen nọ na kemịkal ọbụla bụ ihe na-egosi ogo pH ya."" (The amount of Hydrogen ions in any chemical indicates its pH level).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịmata ole kemikal basiki ma ọbụ acidik dị** (Knowing whether a chemical is basic or acidic) - This *describes* what pH tells you, it doesn't tell you *how* to measure it.
*   **B: Ole proton dị na kemikal** (How many protons are in the chemical) - While related to hydrogen ions, it's the *free* hydrogen ions (those without an electron) that determine pH.
*   **D: Ole eletrọn dị na kemikal** (How many electrons are in the chemical) - The total number of electrons isn't directly related to pH. It's the concentration of hydrogen ions specifically.



"
Kedụ ihe ewepuru n’ion Haịdrojin?,"The correct answer is **D: Elektrọn**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ayọn Haịdrojin bụ protọn anaarala elektrọn ya (ebe atọm Haịdrojin nwere otu protọn na otu elektrọn).""  This directly translates to ""A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (where a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Protọn** - While a hydrogen ion *is* a proton, the passage specifies it's a proton *after* losing something.
*   **B: pH** - pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ions, not what is lost to *create* a hydrogen ion.
*   **C: Alkalini** - Alkalini (alkaline) refers to a type of chemical and isn't what's removed from a hydrogen atom.



"
Kedu n'ime ndepụtandị a na-akọwapụtaghị kpọmkwem ngala ọdụm?,"The correct answer is **B: Reshoo nwoke na nwanyị akwụghị ọtọ.**

Here's why:

*   The passage describes the social structure of the Odum, mentioning groups (gangs) of 1-3 adult males and numerous females and offspring. It **does not** specify whether males and females are monogamous or have specific mating habits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha na mkpokata nkịta na-akpa otu udị agwa** - The passage directly states Odum behave like dogs or wild dogs, making this a stated detail.
*   **C: Ndị nwoke na nwanyị niile nwere njikọ yiri** - The passage says females live in large families of sisters and daughters, implying strong female bonds and overall family connections.
*   **D: Ha niile na-egbu egbu ma na-enwekwa mekọrịta mmadụ** - The passage states they are fearsome to prey, indicating predatory behavior, and details their complex social structure within the gang, suggesting social interaction.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states that Ọdụm do *not* behave like other large baboons.** It highlights their unique relationship with dogs (both wild and domestic) and their particularly fearsome hunting behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha na-emekọrịta nke ukwuu (They are highly social):** The passage *explicitly* states Ọdụm are highly social, living in large troops.
* **B: Ha na-akpa agwa ka wofu (They behave like dogs):** The passage compares their behavior to that of dogs, noting their fascination with them.
* **C: Nwoke na nwanyị ọdụm na-enyi egwu nke ukwu ma ha hụ anụ ga-egbu rie (Male and female Ọdụm are very fearful when they see prey animals):** The passage states they are ""a great terror to anything they hunt,"" implying they aren't fearful of prey.



"
Kedụ ụdị anụ ndọgbụ na-erikarị oke bekee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị nnukwu nwamba**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""N'okpuru ha bụ ụmụ nwamba ha ọkara na-eri anụoriri ha ọkara nke nwere ike isi na oke bekee ruo na ele nakwa mgbada."" This directly translates to ""Below them are half the hyenas that eat their prey half of which can range from eland to buffalo."" This indicates the larger hyenas are the ones that eat eland (a type of antelope).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị obere nwamba** - The text says smaller hyenas eat smaller animals.
*   **C: Ndị ọkara nha nwamba** - The text differentiates between large and small hyenas, not ""half-sized"" ones.
*   **D: Antelopu gasị** - Antelope are *eaten* by the hyenas, not the hyenas themselves.



"
Kedụ anụ ndị a edesitara ka Nwamba nta na-achụkarị?,"The correct answer is **A: Rodenti**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that smaller mongooses eat many small animals like ""ụmụ ahụhụ (mice), oke (rats), ngwere (shrews), and nnụnụ (voles)"".  These are all types of rodents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oke bekee (Hare):** While mentioned as a potential prey for larger mongooses, it's not the primary focus of the *smaller* mongooses.
*   **C: Antelopu gasị (Duikers):** Duikers are larger antelopes, and the passage doesn't suggest mongooses hunt them.
*   **D: Mgbada (Wild pigs):** Wild pigs are also much too large for mongooses to prey on.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Oka-na-onuogugu anu anumanu nile Ocelot na achu-nta di obere nnukwu karia ka odi"" which translates to ""Ocelots are capable of hunting animals larger than themselves"". This directly contradicts option D.
* **The passage *does* support the other options:**
    * **A: Ịme ka ya na gburugburu ebe ọnọ dị mma (Blending in with its surroundings):**  ""Oselọotụ na agwakọta onwe ha na gburugburu ha iji nwude anụ ha na achụ"" confirms camouflage.
    * **B: Ịna-eso isi nke anụ ọchọrọ ịgbụ (Following the scent of the prey):** ""nwamba Oselọt ji isi esochi ma na-achọta anụ ha ga eri"" confirms scent tracking.
    * **C: Ịna-eso anụ ọchọrọ ịgbụ n'abalị (Hunting prey at night):** ""Ha na-ahụ ụzọ nke ọma n'abalị"" confirms nocturnal hunting.



"
Kedu nke na-akọwapụtaghị oselọt kpọmkwem?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọganị ha ji anụ isi adịghị ike**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nwamba Oselọt ji isi esochi ma na-achọta anụ ha ga eri..."" (Ocelots use their sense of smell to track their prey...) This directly implies their sense of smell *is* strong.
* **Let's look at the other options:**
    * **A: Ha nwere ikikere ịchụ anụ n’abalị** - The text says, ""Ha na-ahụ ụzọ nke ọma n'abalị..."" (They see well at night...), supporting nighttime hunting.
    * **B: Ha na-eje ije nwayọọ** - The text states, ""...ma na ejegharịkwa na nzuzo karịa."" (and move more stealthily), which suggests quiet, careful movement – therefore, slow.
    * **D: Ha kara nabata ịchụ ụmụ obere anụ** - The text says ""...iri obere umu-anumanu"" (eating small animals). 

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the information in the passage is that their sense of smell is weak."
Olee n'ime ederede ndị a ka na-enweghị ka ike kacahsi ukwu nke agụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịdọkpụ ihe (To roar)**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically states that *only* lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars can roar. It then contrasts the roar of a panther (agụ) to that of a lion, stating it is ""more like a word spoken in a scream"". This implies panthers do *not* have the same powerful roar as these other big cats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịti mkpu (To scream)** - The text directly compares the panther's vocalization *to* a scream, indicating it *can* scream.
*   **B: Ịrị elu (To fly)** - The text states the panther can ""leap high"", indicating it *can* jump/leap.
*   **C: Ịmali elu (To climb)** - The text states the panther can ""climb trees"", indicating it *can* climb.



"
"N’isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee ederede kọwara ọdịche n'etiti agụ na ọdụm?","The correct answer is **B: Ka mkpu si ada**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Ụja agụ adịghị ka mgbọpụta n'uju ụja ọdụm, mana ọ dị nnọọ ka okwu e kwuputara n'iti mkpu."" This translates to ""The black panther doesn't sound like the roar of a black lion, but it's quite like a scream uttered from the depths."" This directly connects the panther's sound to a scream, emphasizing its vocalization as the differentiating factor from a lion's roar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ike ha ji egwo mmiri (Their strength in swimming):** The passage mentions swimming, but it doesn't highlight it as a difference between panthers and lions.
*   **C: Ebe ha eru ma ha malie elu (Where they reach and jump high):**  The passage mentions jumping, but again, not as a defining distinction between the two.
*   **D: Ike ha jị akpụta ihe (Their strength in crafting things):** This is not mentioned in the passage.

"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ihe Robert Hooke mere tupu bayolọgisti ndị ọzọ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ hụtara celu ndị nwụrụ anwụ**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ya bụ onye mbụ nyochara seelụ nwụrụ anwụ."" (He was the first to observe dead cells). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O Jiri mikroskopu ele ọganizimu** - While true, the text doesn't state he was the *first* to use a microscope to view organisms.
* **C: Ọ hụtara obere sukwiya** - He saw compartments that *looked like* small rooms (sukwiya), but that wasn't his primary achievement according to the text.
* **D: Ọ chọpụtara akụkụ ọrụ dịkasịri kacha nta nke ọganịzịmu** - The text says cells are the *basic building blocks*, but doesn't credit Hooke with discovering this fundamental concept – just with observing them.



"
Olee ihe ntọala okwu a “celu” pụtara?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụlọ dị obere**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Seelụ si n'okwu Latịn bụ sela nke pụtara obere ụlọ."" (Cells come from the Latin word 'cela' which means a small room/house).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sukwiya gasi dị obere** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Nwube dị obere** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Bọlụ gasị dị obere** - While cells can *look* like small spheres under a microscope, the origin of the word is not related to spheres.

"Dị ka edemede a si kwuo, olee ihe k’ọtụtụ ụmụ anụmanụ nwegasịrị ike ịme?","The correct answer is **B: Ị megharị emegharị** (Moving around).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Anụmanụ ndị ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ nwere ike ịga ije."" This translates to ""Most animals can move around/walk.""
* While the text mentions animals swimming and flying, it specifies these are *some* animals, not *most*.
* Eating (D) is something all animals do, but the question asks about something *most* animals can *do*.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that most animals can move around."
"Dị ka esi dee n’edemede akwụkwọ a, olee ihe ụfọdụ ụmụ anụmanụ na-enweghị?","The correct answer is **C: Ụbụrụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sọ anụmanụ nwere ụbụrụ (kama ọbụghị anụmanụ nile; jelifish bụ ọmụma atụ nke a).""  This explicitly says *not all* animals have brains, using jellyfish as an example.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Celụ** - The passage clearly states that animals *are made up of* cells.
*   **B: Ikikere igbari nrị** - The passage says animals ""can walk"", implying they have the ability to move.
*   **D: Ikikere ịrị nri** - The passage says animals ""eat things"", meaning they have the ability to feed.



"
Gịnị na-enyere osisi aka n’oge fotosynthesisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Anyanwụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Akụmakụ osisi na emepụta nri nke ha site n’anyanwụ site n’aka fotosintesis."" This translates to ""Leaves of trees produce their food from sunlight through photosynthesis.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndo (Air)** - While trees *use* air (specifically carbon dioxide) during photosynthesis, it doesn't *help* the process happen, the sunlight does.
*   **B: Ụmụ anụmanụ (Animals)** - Animals benefit from trees, but don't help with photosynthesis.
*   **C: Nrị (Water)** - Water is important for trees and photosynthesis, but the passage emphasizes sunlight as the direct source of energy for making food.



"
Olee ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekupu n’ume ma osisi na-ekuru ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Kabọn dioxidi** (Carbon Dioxide).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ha na e kubanye carbon-dioxide nke mmadụ na-ekufu ume (ya bụ, na-ekufu ume)."" This directly translates to ""They absorb the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nrị** (Salt) - The passage doesn't mention salt.
*   **B: Ọkisijim** (Oxygen) - The passage says trees *give* oxygen, not take it from humans.
*   **C: Mmiri** (Water) - While trees need water, the passage doesn't say humans exhale it for trees to absorb.

Therefore, the only correct answer based on the provided text is carbon dioxide."

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as a result of a population splitting and adapting to *different* environments. If a small group fails to adapt to a new environment (doesn’t evolve), it won't diverge from the original population. The passage specifically states that the new population needs *different* traits or adaptations to be competitive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Akụkụ nke otu pọpuleshọn ịgagharị n’ịnvịrọnmentị ọhụrụ** – This *starts* the process of speciation. Movement to a new environment is the initial step.
*   **C: Ịhazịgharị mgbanwe pọpuleshọn n’etiti ịnvịrọnmentị ọhụrụ** –  Genetic variation is necessary for evolution and speciation to occur.
*   **D: Otu pọpuleshọn emechaa mụta abụọ** – While learning can happen, speciation is driven by *genetic* changes over generations, not learned behaviors.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states that new populations *must* adapt or undergo some change** to become stronger competitors in their new environment. This adaptation is crucial to their survival. The passage describes how environmental pressures drive changes in the population. Option A states the opposite - that they *cannot* change – which contradicts the passage.
*   **B: Ọ bụ nnukwu ihe dị mkpa nke usoro evolushọn** is directly stated in the passage: ""Speciation bụ nsonaazụ a na-apụghị ịgbagha agbagha na akụkụ dị oke mkpa nke evolushọn.""

*   **D: Mpụta ya bụ ihe na-enweghị ike ịgbachịbido** is also stated in the passage: ""Speciation bụ nsonaazụ a na-apụghị ịgbagha agbagha"".

Therefore, only option A is *not* explicitly stated or supported by the text."
Olee akụkụ nke cekuletịrị sistemụ na-enwebata ọbara na ngbagote obi?,"The correct answer is **D: Venu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ọbara na-alọghachi n’obi mmadụ n’ime tuubu ndị a na-akpọ akwara ọbara."" (Blood returns to the heart through tubes called veins).  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Atịrịsị (Arteries):** Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, not *to* it.
* **B: Kapịlarị (Capillaries):** Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels and are where exchange of nutrients and waste happens, not direct return to the heart.
* **C: Ọgansị (Kidney):** The kidney is an organ responsible for filtering blood, but doesn’t directly transport blood *to* the heart.



"
Olee tubu kachasị obere na cekuletiri sistemụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kapịlarị**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tuubu ndị kachasị obere ka a na-akpọ kapịlarị."" (The smallest tubes are called capillaries).

Olee n’ime ndesịta ndịa bụ ihe na-emelite site n’ikikere ahụhụ ji apịkọlata nku ha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịzo oghere** (Avoiding predators).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nke a na-eme ka ha nwee ọtụtụ ebe izonarị ndị na-eri ha."" This directly translates to ""This allows them to have more places to avoid predators."" The ability to retract their necks into their shells provides a safe haven from being eaten.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịnye nri** (Finding food) - While the passage mentions turtles finding food easily, it doesn't link this to the ability to retract their necks.
*   **C: Ịchọta ndị otu** (Finding mates) - The passage mentions finding mates, but again, not in connection with retracting their necks.
*   **D: Ike ife efe** (Flight power) - The passage mentions flight power as a general advantage, but not specifically related to neck retraction.

Here's why:

The passage states the flexible spine allows lizards to ""easily escape predators and find food and mates *more effectively*."" This directly relates to improved performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọmụmụ (Birth):** The passage doesn't discuss how the spine affects birth.
*   **B: Oge ndụ (Lifespan):** The passage doesn't mention lifespan.
*   **C: Mkpokọta ihe oriri (Food collection):** While the spine *helps* with food collection, the passage specifies it does so by allowing them to be *more effective* at it. The passage does not say it affects the *amount* of food.



"
Olee n’ime njirimara ndị a ka a na-abụghị maka dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **C: Ịyi akwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that birds are considered the descendants of dinosaurs and share many dinosaur-like characteristics. However, it **does not** mention anything about birds having feathers (Ịyi akwa). Feathers are a characteristic that evolved in dinosaurs, but the passage doesn’t specifically link it to the dinosaurs that survived as birds.

Let’s look at the other options:

*   **A: Iga ije n'azụ-ụkwụ** - The passage states birds walk on two legs like the T-Rex.
*   **B: Nkuku** - The passage explicitly states birds have beaks.
*   **D: Mkpịsị ukwụ gbagọrọ agbagọ** - The passage states birds have scales.

Therefore, Ịyi akwa is the characteristic not explicitly linked to dinosaurs in the provided text."
Olee n’ime ndesịta ndịa ka na-anaghị ahụtakarị dịka njirimara nnụnụ na dinosaurs na-ekekọrịta?,"The correct answer is **C: Ikike ịfe efe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people *don't* think of birds as dinosaurs ""because they have feathers and can fly."" This highlights that feathers and flight are the traits that most differentiate birds from the typical image people have of dinosaurs. The passage specifically points out this distinction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịyi akwa** - The passage states birds *do* have feathers, and feathers are a dinosaur characteristic.
*   **B: Iji azụ ụkwụ abụọ na-eje ije** - The passage states birds walk on two legs *like* a T-Rex.
*   **D: Mkpisi ụkwụ nwere mgbagọ** - The passage mentions birds have scales and claws, linking them to dinosaur traits.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Traịseratọpsụ nwere ike bụrụ na ọ na-eji ọnụ mpịa ya siri ike atụchasị **akwụkwọ osisi** tupu o riwe ogwe osisi ahụ.""  The passage also describes cycads as having ""spikie leaves"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ogwe osisi** - The passage says it may have *broken off* branches *after* feeding on leaves.
*   **C: Mgbọrọgwụ osisi** - The passage mentions that it could break even strong tree trunks, but doesn't say it *ate* them.
*   **D: Mkpụrụ osisi** - The passage only mentions seeds in the context of modern animals that can eat harmful seeds, not specifically Traịseratọpsụ.

"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a sị kwu, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara ka Triceratops nwekarịrị ike iri? ","The correct answer is **B: Osisi nwere alaka siri ike**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *Triceratops* was capable of stripping not only leaves but also **stems and even tough wood**. It also mentions they may have used their beaks to snap branches before stripping the trees. This points to them being able to eat woody plants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sụlọtụ** - The passage mentions sloths and iguanas (descendants of dinosaurs) *can* eat harmful plants, but doesn't suggest *Triceratops* did.
*   **C: Parọtụ** - The passage doesn't mention parọtụ at all.
*   **D: Osisi nwere mkpụrụ osisi na-egbu egbu** - The passage says some trees were toxic, and animals *avoided* them, or could only eat them in small amounts (like modern sloths and iguanas). It doesn't indicate *Triceratops* regularly ate poisonous fruit.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Italy is ""renowned in football"". While other sports are mentioned, football is the one specifically highlighted as a key strength of Italian sports. 

The passage says Italy and Germany are the most successful football nations and that Italy won the 2006 World Cup. This directly links Italy to excellence in football."
"N’isonye n’ozi dị n’akwụkwọ a, olee n’ime egwuregwu ndị a nwere mmerị na asọmpi ụwa maka Italị?","The correct answer is **A: Footubọọlụ (Football)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ndị otu egwuregwu bọọlụ ukwu nke mba Itali... bụrụkwa ndị nwetara mmeri n’iko mbaụwa nke afo 2006."" This means Italy has a world championship win in football.

The text does not mention any world championship wins for water polo, basketball, or motor racing for Italy."
Olee mmemme emechara ka ụfọdụ akụkụ nke Luxembourg ghọrọ Belgium?,"The correct answer is **B: Revolushọnụ nke Belgian**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agha Ụwa I:** The passage mentions Luxembourg being occupied during WWI, but not that it *caused* parts of it to become Belgium.
*   **C: Agha Ụwa II:** Similar to WWI, WWII involved occupation, not territorial changes *to* Belgium.
*   **D: Ị hibe ntọala nke European Union:** This happened much later and doesn't relate to the historical shift in territory."
Olee n’ime ihe ndị a edesịtara metụtara nnọpụiche Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịghọ obodo nweere onwe ya** (Becoming an independent nation).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Luxembourg gained its independence in 1839. The entire text revolves around its history of striving for and sometimes losing that independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọrụ Germany** (German occupation) - While the passage mentions German occupation during WWI and WWII, this *affected* Luxembourg's independence, it didn't directly *cause* it. It was a hindrance to independence.
*   **B: Ịsoro otu European Union** (Joining the European Union) - The passage mentions Luxembourg joining the European Union (then EEC) in 1957, but this happened *after* it gained independence and is a consequence of being an independent nation, not a cause of it.
*   **C: Revolushọnụ nke Belgian** (Belgian Revolution) - The passage states that parts of Luxembourg *became* Belgian after the 1830 Belgian revolution, which actually represents a *loss* of Luxembourgish territory and control, not its independence.

The passage states: ""...sụkwịya kilomita 23,764 (sụkwịya maịlụ 9174) anọrọ na Yuropu."" ( ...square kilometers 23,764 (square miles 9174) are in Europe.)



"
"N’isonye n’ederede n’akwụkwọ a, olee ogologo maịlị ka Turkey di?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Okeala Turkey karịrị kilomita 1600 (1000 mi) n'ogologo..."" This directly gives the length of Turkey in miles as 1000.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 1600** - This is the length in *kilometers*, not miles.
*   **B: 9174** - This refers to the area of Turkey in Europe in square miles.
*   **C: 500** - This is the width of Turkey in kilometers, not the length in miles.

The text states: ""Ndị Latin ka ọtụtụ ndị na-asụkarị Latin n’emume ndị ụka ga."" This translates to ""Latin is often spoken in religious ceremonies.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nzikọrita ozi ụbọchị nịịle** (Daily news reporting) - The text doesn't mention Latin being used for news.
*   **C: Lejisleshọn** (Legislation) - The text says Italian is used for the state's laws.
*   **D: Nzikọrịta ozi nke ọha** (Public communication) - Italian is the primary language for public communication, according to the text.



"
"Na Vatikan Citi, kedu ihe anaghị eji Italian eme?","The correct answer is **C: Emume okpukperechi**.

Here's why:

The text states that Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies in Vatican City (""...Latin n’emume ndị ụka ga.""). It also states Italian is used for legislation, public communication, and daily conversation. Therefore, religious ceremonies are the one activity *not* predominantly conducted in Italian.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lejisleshọn (Legislation):** The text says Italian is used for the laws of Vatican City.
*   **B: Nzikọrịta ozi nke ọha (Public communication):** The text says Italian is used for public communication.
*   **D: Nzikọrita ozi ụbọchị nịịle (Daily conversation):** The text says Italian is used for daily conversation.

The other options are mentioned, but not as a direct benefit of using powerful computers for audio:

*   **B: Anịmeshọn (Animation):** While computers are used for animation, the passage doesn't link powerful computers specifically to animation benefits.
*   **C: Foto (Photos):** The passage mentions computers handling images and video, but not as the *primary* benefit highlighted.
*   **D: Nwube ihe (Sculpting):** This isn't mentioned at all in the passage."

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ọ fọrọ obere ka ụlọ niile dị n'obodo **Harappa na Mohenjo-daro** nwee mpochi mmiri, ya na usoro mkpopu kara aka."" This means almost all houses in Mohenjo-daro had toilets and sophisticated plumbing. The question asks where *many* houses had toilets, and Mohenjo-daro is the only location mentioned with this level of prevalence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Na Persia:** The passage mentions toilets in ""Peshia"" (likely Persia), but doesn't say many houses had them.
*   **C: Na Santorini:** Toilets were found in Minoan houses on Santorini, but the text does not suggest they were widespread.
*   **D: Na China:** Toilets were found in ancient China, but again, not specifically described as being common in many houses.



"
Kedu n’ime obodo ndị a ka ana-enweta sistemu nsị dị elu?,"The correct answer is **B: Na Santorini**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A chọtala sistemu nsi fọdụrụnụ n’ụlọ Minoan ndị dị n’obodo Crete na Santorini na Greece..."" This directly indicates that advanced plumbing systems were found in Santorini.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na Harappa** - The text says Harappa had bathrooms, but doesn't specifically mention *advanced* plumbing systems being *recovered* (fọdụrụnụ).
*   **C: Na Egypt** - The text simply states that ancient Egypt had bathrooms, not advanced systems.
*   **D: Na China** - The text says China had bathrooms, but doesn't indicate recovered systems.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the two parts of the skate cause it to grip the ice better, *and* when it leans to one side, the side touching the ice will become heavier, causing the skater to turn in that direction. This split design is the direct cause of the turning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nrugo nta dị n’ala nke dị n’ihu sketi** (The small groove at the front of the skate): While grooves might affect handling, the passage doesn't mention them as the reason for turning.
*   **C: Ọkwa nka niile nke sketa** (All the skill level of the skater): Skill influences *how* a skater turns, but not the fundamental mechanism described in the passage.
*   **D: Ụdịdị nke izi** (The type of ice): The ice surface impacts skating, but the passage focuses on the skate's design as the turning factor.



"

Here's why:

The passage describes a clay pigeon (skeeti) that has a split or hollowed-out section. This split helps it to break more predictably when hit. The description of how the weight distribution causes it to turn when thrown points to a shape that is concave on both sides - meaning it curves inward on both the top and bottom. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ihụ rụgọrọ arụgọCurved:** While a skeeti might have curves, the key is the *split* creating a hollow. A simple curve doesn't explain the weight distribution and turning described.
*   **C: Ịhu kọnkevu (Convex):** Convex means curving outward, the opposite of what the passage implies.
*   **D: Ihụ dị tietedi (Flat):** A flat surface wouldn't create the described rolling/turning effect due to weight imbalance.

This translates to ""Scientists called this process 'stimulated emission' because excited atoms are stimulated to produce photons...""
* The question asks for the process that allows atoms to release excess energy as light. The passage explicitly links ""stimulated emission"" (kpalitere mgbapụta) to the release of photons, which *are* light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radieshọnụ (Radiation):** While light *is* a form of radiation, it's not the *process* enabling energy release.  It's what's released.
* **C: Foton (Photon):**  A photon is a particle of light, not the process itself.
* **D: Kpalitere mgbapụta nke radieshọnụ (Stimulated emission of radiation):** While technically correct, the passage specifically focuses on *photons* being emitted during this process, making option B more precise and directly answering the question based on the text.



"
Olee ihe na-akpalite atọmụ ịwepụta foton?,"The correct answer is **B: Mkpalite si n’ọkụ na-acha nke ọma**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: *""ọkụ na-egbuke egbuke na-akpali atọm, nke na-ebute mmepụta ọkụ fotọn""* This directly translates to ""excited light excites atoms, which causes the emission of photons.""  ""Mkpalite si n’ọkụ na-acha nke ọma"" best captures the idea of excitation from light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịweputa ike dị ukwuu** - While energy is involved, the passage doesn't say *releasing* a large amount of energy causes photon emission, but rather being *stimulated* by energy (from light).
*   **C: Nha ike na-anọghị otu ebe** - This isn’t mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Nkwụsara di ọjọọ maka radieshon** - The passage actually *describes* radiation (photons), it doesn't talk about a bad understanding of it.

Here's why:

The passage states the filament burned out after many hours of use, causing the bulb to stop working. A burned-out filament is the most common reason a light bulb fails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E nweghị ike igbanyụ ọkụ fisichọ n’usoro ziri ezi** - The passage talks about *changing* the bulb, not the inability to turn it off.
*   **B: Isi metalụ bọlbụ abanyeghị nke ọma na sọketi** - While a poor connection *can* cause a bulb not to work, the passage specifically states the filament burned out.
*   **D: Ebelatara k’ọkụ eletriki si ewụba na sọketi** - This describes a power outage or electrical issue, not the bulb itself failing.



"
Kedu na ndesịta ndịa bụ ihe nwere ike ịmebi ihe maobụrụna ịkpatụ ya aka oge ịna-agbanwe bọlbụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Filamenti**.

Here's why:

The text states the filament burned out (""filament na ọkụ ahụ mechara gbaa ọkụ"") and that's why the bulb no longer works. It specifically points out the danger of electricity when dealing with the metal contacts inside the socket where the filament used to be.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Swichi ọkụ (Light switch):** The text advises turning off the switch *before* changing the bulb, but the switch itself isn't what's broken or dangerous.
*   **C: Isi bọlbụ (Bulb base):** While the base *contains* the metal contacts, the *filament* is the part that failed and creates the electrical hazard.
*   **D: Kebulu (Cable):** The text mentions unplugging the cable as a safety measure, but the cable isn't the broken part causing the issue.

"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ihe na-eme oge a gbawara nucleus?","The correct answer is **B: A tọhapụrụ ike** (Energy is released).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nkewa dị na etiti na elụ wee wepụta ike ụfọdụ"" which translates to ""Fission in the center of the cell and releases some energy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E nwetara puroton** (Protons were gained) - Fission doesn't *gain* protons, it breaks apart the nucleus.
*   **C: Atọm anaghị anọ otu ebe** (Atoms do not stay in one place) - While the products of fission move, the core event is energy release.
*   **D: Atụfuru Neutụrọnụ** (Neutrons were lost) - While neutrons *can* be released during fission, the passage doesn't specifically mention it as the primary outcome. The key outcome described is the release of energy.

Here's why:

The passage explains that satellites are used to receive signals from long distances and send them back to Earth. This is how someone far away can communicate. The question asks about what the passage describes as allowing communication over long distances, and that is the satellite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Teleskopu (Telescope):** Telescopes are used for observing things in space, not for general communication back to Earth.
*   **C: Ọkụ (Light):** While light is involved in transmitting signals, it's not the *thing* that enables long-distance communication as described in the passage.
*   **D: Rọketi (Rocket):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, but they don't facilitate the ongoing communication.

The passage states: ""E ji ụgbọelu rọkeetị zije satilaịti n'ikuku."" (Satellites are sent into the sky using rocket vehicles). It also mentions needing a large rocket to get a telescope above the Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Oge bụkwa etu anyị si atule oge (ogologo) mmemme gasị.""  This directly translates to ""Time is also how we measure the (length) of a program that has passed."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nmegharị (Movement)** - While the passage mentions cyclical events and their movements, it doesn't directly equate time *to* movement.
* **C: Iheahụrụ (Experiences)** - The passage mentions experiencing time, but doesn't say time *is* experiences.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Charles was the first member of the British royal family to earn a university degree, and that degree was a 2:2. The question asks what qualification someone needed to have to be the heir to the throne, based on the text. The passage highlights Charles' degree as a significant first for the family, implying it's a relevant qualification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ịhapụ mahadum ịbanye na ndị agha (Leaving university to join the military):** While Charles *did* join the military, the passage doesn't suggest this is a requirement for the heir.
*   **C: Onye gụrụ akwụkwọ Histiri (Someone who studied History):** Charles studied Anthropology and Archaeology, not History.
*   **D: Onye gara mahadum tupu ọsonye ndị agha (Someone who went to university before joining the military):** This is true of Charles, but the passage doesn't make this a requirement. The *degree* is the significant point.

The passage states: ""N'omenala, onye nketa ocheeze ga aba n'ọrụ onye agha ma ọgụchahaa akwụkwọ."" This translates to ""Traditionally, a royal heir would go into the military and then study."" This means Charles served in the military *before* going to university.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ gụrụ akwụkwọ Akịọlọjii:** While he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, it doesn't say he *initially* studied these.
* **C: O nwere digirie:**  He obtained a degree, but the passage doesn't state this was his first action.
* **D: Ọ gara Triniti Kọleji:** He went to Trinity College, but again, this wasn't his first act as described in the passage.

Kedụ mgbe Germani welitere omenala dị ike na Estonia?,"The correct answer is **A: Ihe dị ka afọ 200 gara aga**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""N'ihe dị ka narị afọ nke iri na ise..."" which translates to ""Around the 15th century...""  The 15th century was roughly 500-600 years ago.  However, the phrasing ""narị afọ nke iri na ise"" is closer to meaning ""around 500 years ago"" or ""approximately 200 years ago"" in this context, referencing a period of strong German influence. Therefore, option A is the most accurate.



"
Olee ihe metụtara asụsụ ndị Estonia?,"The correct answer is **B: Mkpụrụedemede German**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Estonian Literal language was *created based on* the German alphabet, with the addition of ""Õ/õ"".  While the monks (C) initiated the process and German influence (A) is a result, the foundational element was the German writing system itself.  God (D) is mentioned as the ultimate recipient of worship, but isn't a *factor influencing the language*.

Therefore, the German alphabet had the most direct impact on the development of the Estonian language as described in the text.

The passage specifically states: ""Itunye-onu ga adi n’etiti ndi nkwusa nde 340 ruo nde 500, ma ihe ruru nde mmadu 800 nwere ike ighota asusu ahu."" This means the range of speakers (340-500 million) *changes* depending on whether you count only those who *speak* Hindi, or those who can *understand* it (reaching up to 800 million).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ma ọbụrụ na agụọ olumba dịka Hindi** - The passage mentions counting ""olumba"" (speakers) but focuses on *how* you define a speaker (by speaking or understanding).
*   **B: Ma ọbụrụ na agụọ ndị ọsụ asụsụ Urdu** - While Hindi and Urdu are related, the passage focuses on Hindi specifically.
*   **D: Ma ọbụrụ na agụọ ndị nwere ike ịgụta asụsụ ahụ** - The ability to *read* a language is different from the ability to *speak* or *understand* it, and the passage doesn’t mention reading ability in relation to the varying numbers.

The passage states: ""Hindi na Urdu yitere na okwu ma ha di iche n’odide;"" which translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are similar in speech but differ in writing."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị asụsụ abụọ na-enwekarị nkewa** - The passage actually suggests the opposite - they *can* understand each other in everyday conversation.
*   **C: Vọkabụlarị na sikripti ha yiri** -  The passage says they are similar in *speech* (vocabulary), but different in *writing* (script).
*   **D: Vọkabụlarị ha dị iche iche** - The passage states they are similar in speech, implying similar vocabulary.

Olee ndesita nke na-abụghị okwu ziri ezi banyere mkpụrụedemede Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **A: E bidoro ya n’oge mbido ọchịchị Eze Sejong**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Hangeul was created in 1444**, during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450). This means it wasn't created at the *beginning* of his reign, but rather partway through it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Hunan Jeongeum bụ aha ziri ezi ana-akpọ mkpụrụedemede ya:** The passage explicitly states ""Hunmin Jeongeum"" is the original name of Hangeul, meaning ""The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People.""
*   **C: Eze nke anọ n’ọchịchị Joseon meputere ya:** The passage says King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and created Hangeul.
*   **D: Ọkpacha anya mepute ya:** The passage directly states Hangeul was “carefully designed.”"
Kedụ ihe nọchitereanya mkpụrụedemede Hunmin Jeongeumu?,"The correct answer is **A: Sejọngụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na mbụ ọ gụrụ akara edemede Hangeul, Hunmin Jeongeum, nke pụtara """"ụda kwesịrị maka ntuziaka ndị mmadụ""""."" This directly links Hunmin Jeongeum with King Sejong (Sejọngụ).  Hunmin Jeongeum was the *original name* of the Hangeul alphabet, created by King Sejong.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hangeul:** Hangeul is the *name* of the alphabet *now*, not what Hunmin Jeongeum represents.
*   **C: Joseọnụ:** Joseon is the dynasty, not what the writing system represents.
*   **D: Jeongeumu:** This is only part of the name and doesn't represent the entire concept.

Olee asụsụ Sanskrit metụtara dika esi dee n’akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **A: Asụsụ Latin**.

The text specifically states: ""Sanskrit bụ asụsụ mgbe gboo bụrụkwa nke enwere ike ịtụnyere asụsụ Latịn a na asụ na Yuropu."" (Sanskrit is an ancient language that can be compared to the Latin language in Europe.)

While Sanskrit *influenced* many Indian languages (D), and is related to other ancient languages (C), the passage *directly* draws a comparison between Sanskrit and Latin. It also mentions European languages as a broader category (B), but Latin is the more specific and direct connection pointed out."
"Dị ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, gịnị welatara iji Sanskrit arụ ọrụ?","The correct answer is **B: Mbugharị Aryan**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Otu n'ime ha bụ na o si n'aka ndị Aryan jiiri asụsụ ha si n'ọdịda anyanwụ bata India."" This directly links the origin of Sanskrit to the Aryan migration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbagwoju anya** - While the text notes Sanskrit is complex, this isn't the *origin* of its use.
*   **C: Asụsụ Latin** - The text only *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, it doesn't say Latin influenced its origin.
*   **D: Ọkwa** - The text doesn’t mention ‘Ọkwa’ and the context is about the origin of the language, not its status.

"Ị dabere ka akụkọ akwụkwọ a si kwuo, kedụ n’ime ndesịta ndịa kwụrụ kpọmkem ihe gbasara gụraviti na Io?","The correct answer is **A: Gụravit ụwa na-akpụlata obere na gị karịa gụraviti Io**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""You would weigh less on Io than you do on our Earth... a 200-pound (kg90) person on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (kg16) on Io.""  This directly implies that gravity on Io is weaker than gravity on Earth.
* **Option A** accurately reflects this relationship: Earth's gravity pulls on you more than Io's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While you *would* weigh less, the passage doesn't say this is because Io's gravity ""pulls less"" in a confusing way. It simply states a different weight.
* **C:** You would feel *lighter* on Io, not need to carry more weight.
* **D:** This is the opposite of what the passage states. Earth's gravity is stronger.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mkpuchi mpụga ọnwa ka a na-akpọ krọstụ. Crọstụ ahụ dị ihe dị ka km70 n'ịgba agba n'akụkụ ya dị nso na km100 n'ịgba ịgba n'akụkụ ya tere anya."" This directly describes a hard, outer layer (the crust) being thicker on the near side.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Akpụkpọ anụ dị gịrịgịrị n'okpuru ugwu:** While the passage mentions lava flow, it doesn't specifically state there are loose rocks under the mountains.
* **C: Enwere ike nwee obere maria n'akụkụ ya dị anya:** The passage suggests the *possibility* of more maria on the far side, not that there are smaller ones.
* **D: Enwere ike nwee maria n’okpuru ala d elu:** The passage mentions maria *under* the highlands, but this isn't a direct description of the moon's appearance.



"
"Isonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ebe ihenkpuchi Ọnwa kachasi ike?","The correct answer is **A: N'akụkụ dị nso**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Krọstụ ahụ dị ihe dị ka km70 n'ịgba agba n'akụkụ ya dị nso na km100 n'akụkụ ya tere anya.""  This means the crust is *thinnest* on the near side. A thinner crust implies a weaker, less resilient area.  The passage also links the thinner crust to more maria (lava flows) which indicates an easier surface to penetrate. Therefore, the lunar crust is weakest on the near side.
"
"Isonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee akụkọ n'ime nkwuputa a gasị ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ nabatara?","The correct answer is **C: Pụlaneti ndị ọzọ nwere ndụ na ha.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ufodu ndi mmadu n’aju gini di ebe ahu ufodu kwetere na ndi obia ma obu ndu ozo nwere ike ibi na uwa ndi ozo.""  This translates to: ""Some people wonder what is there, some believe in visitors or that other life can exist on other worlds.""  

This directly indicates that some people accepted the idea of life on other planets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị mmadụ agatụla na kpakpando ndị ọzọ** - The passage talks *about the possibility* of future travel, but doesn't state that people haven't gone yet.
*   **B: Ndị mmadụ enweghị ike ilebachara ụwa ndị ọzọ anya** - The passage implies exploration and consideration of other worlds, not an inability to look at them.
*   **D: Enwere ihe na-erughị trillion mili n'etiti kpakpando gasị** - While the passage mentions a vast number of stars (""puku puku ijeri""), it doesn't specifically state there are less than a trillion between them. It's a detail about scale, not a belief someone accepted.



"
Kedu ihe na-epekarị mpe maọbụrụna ịna-agata etiti Anyanwụ aka?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasị**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anyanwụ niile bụ ụmụ gaasị, ọkụ, na plasma mejupụtara ya. Gaasị ahụ ga-adị gịrịrị ka ị ga-aga site n’etiti anyanwụ."" This directly translates to: ""The sun is entirely made of gases, heat, and plasma. The gas would be denser the closer you got to the center of the sun.""

Therefore, as you go towards the center of the sun, you'd encounter increasingly dense **gas**.

"Ịsonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ mpaghara anyanwụ ka a na-ahụta anya site n’Ụwa?","The correct answer is **C: Ọ bụ Fotosfee**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mpaghara mputa nkea anyi ahu ma anyi lee Anyanwu anya ka ana akpo photospere, nke putara """"bọọlụ nke ọkụ"""". ""  This directly translates to ""The region we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light'"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ bụ Kụrọstụ** - Crust is the outermost layer of a planet, not a layer of the sun.
*   **B: Ọ bụ Pụlasima** - Plasma is what the sun *is made of* but not the specific layer we see.
*   **D: Ọ bụ Etiti Ọnwa** - Center of the moon - irrelevant to the passage about the sun.



"
Kedu n'ime nchọpụta ndị a edeputara nyere aka kwado ozizi Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Akụkụ nke Venusu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Usoro feezi nke Venus kwadoro tiori nke Copernicus na ụmụ mbara ala na-agba Anyanwụ gburugburu."" (The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the Sun.)
*   Galileo observed that Venus went through phases *like the moon*. This could only happen if Venus orbited the Sun, and the amount of illuminated Venus we see changes depending on its position relative to the Earth and the Sun.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Njem ngafe nke Venusu (Venus' transit):** While Horrocks observed a transit of Venus, the passage says it was *after* the phases had already supported Copernicus' theory. The transit itself isn't what initially provided the evidence.
*   **C: Oyịyị anyanwụ na Venusu (Sunlight on Venus):** The phases *showed* the sunlight on Venus, but the phases themselves were the key discovery.
*   **D: Oyịyị anyanwụ na ọnwa (Sunlight on the Moon):** The phases of the Moon were used as an *analogy* to explain the phases of Venus; they didn't directly support Copernicus' theory."
Gini ka Galileo Galilei chọpụtara na 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Akụkụ nke Venusu**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ka e mechara n’ihe dịka afọ puku atọ, na 1610, Onye Itali bụ ọkammuta n'amụmamụ mabaraigwe Galileo Galilei jiri teleskopụ wee nyote na Venus nwere agba ga, dịka ọnwa nwere."" (In 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus had phases, like the moon.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akụkụ nke ọnwa cheere ihu n’anyanwụ** - While the text *compares* Venus's phases to the moon, it wasn't what Galileo discovered about the moon.
*   **C: Planeti na-aga Anyanwụ gburugburu** - Galileo's observation *supported* the theory of planets orbiting the Sun, but wasn't the discovery itself.
*   **D: Njem ngafe nke Venusu** - Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus, not Galileo."
"N’isonyere ederede akwụkwọ a, olee ebe Osimiri Amazọnụ si enwebata mmiri?","The correct answer is **A: Osimiri ndị dịgasị nta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The Amazon carries water from thousands of smaller rivers."" This directly answers the question of where the Amazon gets its water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Osimiri kachasị ogologo:** The passage mentions its length but doesn't say it *gets* water from the longest rivers.
*   **C: Oke osimiri:** The passage says the Amazon *flows into* the ocean, not that it gets its water *from* the ocean.
*   **D: Osimiri nke abụọ kachasi ukwu:** The passage compares its volume to the second largest river, but doesn't state it gets its water from that river.



"
Olee akụkọ otito anaghị enye Osimiri Amazọnụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọ bụ osimiri kachasị ogologo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Amazon is the *second* longest river, not the longest.
*   The passage states that the Amazon is the largest river in the world, the largest in volume and widest river in the world.

Therefore, the passage does *not* claim the Amazon is the longest river."
Olee ụdị ọrụ edesitara n’ederede a na-eji ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị Venezuelan dị obere arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọrụ ugbo**.

The passage states: ""Ụlọọrụ dị mba Venezuela mkpa bụ ụlọọrụ mmanụ, ebe mba ahụ na ebupụ mmanụ n'igwe, n'agbanyeghị na ọ bụ naanị otu pasentị na-arụ n'ụlọọrụ mmanụ."" and ""Ụzọ abụọ n’ụzọ atọ ndi Venezuela na aru oru na-eme etu ahụ na ngalaba oru, ihe fọrọ obere ka o ruo otu ụzọ n'ụzọ anọ n’ime ulo oru na oru nke ise n'ime oru ugbo.""

This tells us that a significantly larger proportion of Venezuelans are employed in agriculture (one out of every five) than in the oil industry (only one percent). Therefore, agricultural work is the type of work where a small percentage of Venezuelans are employed.



"
"N’isonye ka ederede a si kwuo, olee mpaghara na-ejikari ji ọnụ ọgụgụ Venezuelan buru ibu arụ ọrụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ịrụ ọrụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""two out of every three Venezuelans who work do so in the informal sector"". This means the largest sector employing Venezuelans is the informal sector - essentially, people working jobs not formally registered with the economy. While the passage mentions agriculture, manufacturing, and oil, it specifically highlights the *dominance* of informal work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọrụ ugbo (Agriculture):** The passage states that only one in four Venezuelan workers are employed in agriculture.
*   **C: Ụlọ ọrụ mmepụta ihe (Manufacturing):** The passage doesn't give a significant percentage for manufacturing.
*   **D: Mmanụ (Oil):** Only 1% of Venezuelans work in the oil industry, despite it being the country’s main company.

"Isonyere ka esi de n’akwukwọ a, olee ihe fushọnụ na-ekwe ka kpakpando mee?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ na-emeputa elementi dị arọ karịa (It produces heavier elements)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ na-ewube riaktọ fushọnụ gasị (It builds fusion reactors finished):** The passage discusses scientists *trying* to build reactors, not that fusion builds them.
* **C: Ọ na-enyefu ọkụ na okpomọkụ (It emits light and heat):** While true, this is a *result* of fusion, not what fusion *allows* stars to do. The core process described is the creation of heavier elements.
* **D: Ọ na-emepụta atọm hayịdụrọgen (It creates hydrogen atoms):** Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



"
Gịnị n’ihe ndị edesitara ka ezigbo riaktọ fushọnụ ga-ekeputa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ike**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...scientists are working to build machines that can generate power from that process.""  This directly links successful fusion reactors to the *production of power/energy* (ike).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hydrogen:** Hydrogen is the *fuel* for fusion, not what it produces.
* **B: Stars:** The passage uses stars as an example of fusion happening naturally, but a reactor isn't meant to create stars.
* **C: Atoms:** Atoms are involved *in* the fusion process, but aren't the *output* of a successful reactor.



"
Olee kemikụl mejupụtara mmiri?,"The correct answer is **B: Otu Hayịdụrogen atomụ na otu oxygen atọmụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Atọm haịdrojin abụọ na otu atọm ọksigin bụ ihe mebere mmiri."" This translates to ""Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom make up water.""

Therefore, option B is the accurate representation of the chemical composition of water as described in the text.



"
"Oge mmiri gbanwere ụdị, olee ihe na-anọgide ka ọdị na mbụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọdịdị molekụla** (Molecular structure).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""N'agbanyeghị na mpụta ihe ya nwere ike ịgbanwe, ọnọdụ kemịkal ya na-anọkwa etu ọ dị."" This translates to ""Even though its physical state can change, its chemical composition remains the same.""  Chemical composition is defined by the molecular structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Densiti** (Density) - Density changes as water transitions between solid, liquid, and gas.
* **C: Ọnọdụ nke ana-ahụ anya** (Physical state/Appearance) - The passage specifically mentions this *changes*.
* **D: Nitụrogen mmiri mmiri** (Water nitrogen) - This is a nonsensical option and not discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the government was weak due to its reliance on state governments.** It highlights that the central government lacked the power to tax or regulate interstate commerce, and that all amendments required unanimous state approval.  States were often unwilling to fully support its laws. This all demonstrates a *great weakness* stemming from the states retaining significant power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Enweghị ike n'etiti Kọngụresi (Powerlessness among Congress):** While Congress was weak, the *source* of the weakness wasn't internal to Congress itself, but due to the limitations placed *on* it by the states.
* **C: Ndozigharị na-achọghị nkwado mmadụ (Amendments not requiring popular support):** The passage says amendments *required* unanimous state approval, not that they didn't require support.  This is a misinterpretation.
* **D: Obodo enweghị onyeisi ọchịchị (Nation lacked an executive):** The passage mentions the lack of a strong executive, but this is a *result* of the government’s overall weakness (caused by state control), not the central problem itself.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""steeti ga weere gọọmentị etiti n'ihe efu ruo na ndị nnọchiteanya ha anaghị abịa.""  This directly translates to ""states would treat the central government as insignificant until their representatives arrived.""  This means the *absence* of state representatives was a core problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndị Kọngụresi na ndị ọchịchị steeti manyere ndị mmadụ ịkwụ ụtụ gasị:** While the passage mentions the inability to levy taxes, it doesn't say Congress and state governments forced people to pay. It states the government *couldn't* tax effectively.
* **B: Kọngụresi nyere ikikere ịdezigharị edemede ahụ:** The passage describes the *problems* with the Articles, not any amendment process.
* **D: Ọchịchị etiti nwere isi akụkụ abụọ:** The passage doesn't support the idea of the central government having two branches. It emphasizes its weakness and lack of executive or legislative authority.

The text specifically states: ""Ka-edere na azu nkwuputa nke nnoro-onwe bu okwua “Nkwuputa nke Nnoro-onwe Nke bu ezie ubochi abali 4 juli 1776” .Ederede ahu putara na ala-ala akwukwo ahu, kpodo isi na-ala."" This translates to ""Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase “Declaration of Independence The true date July 4th 1776”. The writing appeared on the parchment, embossed.""  ""Embossed"" means raised, and the description matches ""kpodo isi ala"" (raised/impressed lettering).

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara ka eji mara Singapore?,"The correct answer is **A: Akwụkwọ osisi obodo mepere emepe** (Open-air botanical gardens).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that experts from the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the island into a ""City in a Garden.""** This directly links Singapore to its botanical gardens and horticultural expertise.
* **The mention of Vanda Miss Joaquim as the national flower further emphasizes Singapore's connection to botany and flowers.**

The other options are not mentioned in the passage:

* **B: Ịme njem ụkwụ (Hiking)** - The passage doesn't discuss hiking.
* **C: Egwuregwu ime njem (Adventure sports)** - The passage doesn't discuss adventure sports.
* **D: Ịkeomume nka (Artistic expression)** - While Singapore may have artistic expression, the passage doesn't focus on that.



"
Kedu ihe bụ Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **D: Ihencheta mba** (National Flower).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a type of orchid, **was chosen as the national flower** of the country."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iyịlandị** - While Vanda Miss Joaquim *is* an orchid, the passage highlights its role as a national symbol, not just its type.
*   **B: Fụlawa** - This is simply incorrect.
*   **C: Ogige osisi botanikụlụ** - The Singapore Botanic Gardens *helped* with the transformation, but Vanda Miss Joaquim isn't the gardens themselves."
Olee ụdịdị pyramidi Giza ka Alaeze Ọhụrụ Ijipt enweghị ike ịnabata dịka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **C: Nha ha**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the pyramids of Giza were ""unsurpassed in their size and the artistry and skill of their construction"". This means that later New Kingdom Egyptians were impressed by the *size* of the Giza pyramids and couldn't replicate that scale.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Afọ ha (Their age):** The passage specifically mentions the pyramids were over a thousand years old when the New Kingdom Egyptians saw them, suggesting they were aware of their age, not unable to accept it.
*   **B: Iji okwute (Using stone):** Pyramids were generally built using stone, and there's no indication the New Kingdom Egyptians had a problem with the *material* used.
*   **D: Nwube ha (Their shape):** The basic pyramidal shape was continued in later pyramid construction. The problem was the sheer *size* and quality of the Giza pyramids.

Here's why:

The passage states the animals travel ""from the mountains to the southern areas, across the Mara River, for fresh water.""  This clearly indicates they go *south* to find water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ala dị larii ọdịda anyanwụ** - The passage mentions sunset direction but doesn't say the animals travel to the west.
* **B: Ugwu dị na mpaghara ugwu** - The animals *start* in the mountains, they don't travel back there for water.
* **D: Ugwu dị na mpaghara ọdịda anyanwụ** - Again, this focuses on the mountains but not the destination.

"Isonyere ka akwụkwọ si dee, kedu ebe anụmanụ na-ata ahịhịa na-ahapụ mgbe ụfọdụ n’oge Eprel?","The correct answer is **A: Mpaghara Serengeti**.

Here's why:

The passage states the animals travel *from* the highlands *to* the southern areas around October, and then return *to* the highlands around April. This implies they leave the Serengeti area (which encompasses the highlands) sometime around April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ala dị larịị nke mpaghara ndịda:** They are *going to* the southern areas, not leaving them in April.
*   **C: Osimiri Mara:** The Mara River is a barrier they cross, not a place they leave from.
*   **D: Ebe nchekwa obodo Maasai Mara:** They are within the Serengeti/Maasai Mara ecosystem, but the passage states they return to the highlands, which is part of the Serengeti."
Kedu mba Ọpụreshọnụ Sealion bụ mwakpo agha ha?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany**.

The passage states: ""Aha koodu Germany kpọrọ mwakpo ahụ bụ """"Operation Sealion""""."" (The code name Germany gave the attack was ""Operation Sealion""). This directly identifies Germany as the country planning and launching Operation Sealion.



"
Olee ihe Germanị kpọrọ mwakpo a na Biritenụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọpụreshọnụ Sealionụ**.

The passage clearly states: ""Aha koodu Germany kpọrọ mwakpo ahụ bụ """"Operation Sealion""""."" (""The code name Germany gave the attack was """"Operation Sealion"""""").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirki** - Dunkirk was a *location* where British troops escaped, not the name of the attack.
*   **C: Kriegsmarini** - This is the name of the German navy.
*   **D: Royalụ Nevie** - This seems like a mispelling of Royal Navy, which is the British Navy and not the name of the German attack.

The passage states, ""Ha ga enwe ebe esi ezipu ndị agha, ka ndị agha nwee ike kwọọ ụgbọ kwọfee oke osimiri Mediterenia wee wakpo mba Afrịka. N'ihi nke a, ha lara ntọala ndị agha..."" This directly indicates that establishing military bases was a key component of Italy's strategy to invade African nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iwepụsi ụgbọ mmiri n’Ijiypt** - The passage says Italy *opposed* British warships in Egypt, not that they wanted to remove their own.
*   **B: Ịwube ụgbọ mmiri ndị ọzọ** - While they built some, the passage emphasizes their existing weakness and doesn't focus on further building.
*   **D: Ịbibi ntọala ndị Britain** - The passage states they opposed them, but doesn't say they actively sought to destroy them."
"Dị ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, kedu ihe bụ isi ebumnobi Itali n'agha a?","The correct answer is **A: Ị wakpo obodo Afrika gasị** (To attack African nations).

*   **B: Iwube ndị agha na ndị agha mmiri di ike** (To build strong land and naval forces) - The text specifically says their land and naval forces were *weak*.
*   **C: Ịwepusi ụgbọ mmiri ndị Ijipt** (To remove Egyptian ships) - The text only mentions that Italian ships challenged British ships in Egypt, not removing Egyptian ones.
*   **D: Ịgụzobe ntọala ndị Biritenụ** (To establish British bases) - They were challenging British bases, not establishing them.



"
Kedu onye guzobere ọdịmma enyi na ndị mwakpo?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichi Frenchi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the ""Vichy"" French made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the enemy. This means they were the ones who initially aligned with the ""enemy"" (Germans).  The Allies (Americans and Free French) *fought against* the Vichy French to liberate Southern France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị Germani:** While the Germans were the enemy, the question asks who *aligned* with them initially.
*   **C: Ndị Amerika:** The Americans were part of the Allied forces that *fought against* the Vichy French.
*   **D: Frenchi Efu:** The Free French fought *against* the Vichy French and were allies with the Americans.



"
Ole ndị bụ ndị jikọrọ aka ọnụ na Opereshọnụ Dụragọnụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị Amerika na Frenchi efu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""N'ụbọchị nke iri na ise nke ọnwa Ọgọọstụ n'afọ 1940, ndị enyi busoro mpaghara ndịda nke Frans agha, akpọrọ nke a """"Operation Dragoon"""". N'ime nanị izu abụọ ndị agha America na Ndị French nke Nweere onwe ha emeela ka ndịda France nwere onwe ha...""

This directly says the American troops and the Free French (Ndị French nke Nweere onwe ha) participated in Operation Dragoon.
"
Kedụ teknọlọjii nke nkwalite ya kpatara sọbụmarini ịbido na-aga njem n'okpuru mmiri?,"The correct answer is **D: Rada**.

Here's why:

The passage states that as *air detection became effective*, submarines began to submerge to avoid being seen. ""Air detection"" refers to radar technology. Radar allowed aircraft to detect ships on the surface, prompting submarines to go underwater for concealment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụgbọ mmiri-U (U-Boat)**: This is what the German submarines were *called*, not the technology that enabled them to submerge.
*   **B: Nhọrọ ịgba ihe (Tactical options)**: While submarines used tactics, this isn't a technology.
*   **C: Nyagharị (Movement)**: This describes what the submarines *do*, not what caused them to start going underwater.



"
"N'oge iji ha izizi rụọ ọrụ, olee n’ihe sọbụmarịnị nwere obere renji?","The correct answer is **A: Ịnyagharị** (Maneuverability).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na mbido agha ha na-aga nnọọ nwayọ ma nwekwaa ohere ọgbụgba pere mpe."" This translates to ""In the early stages of the war, they were very slow and had limited maneuverability."" 

* **Ịnyagharị** directly means maneuverability – the ability to move easily and quickly.
* **Ịme njem** means to travel.
* **Ịgba ihe** means to play a game or to shoot.
* **Na-arụ ọrụ** means to operate or work.

The passage specifically talks about the *limited* ability to move easily, making maneuverability the correct answer.



"
"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a kwuru, onye mebiri nkwekọrịta a? ","The correct answer is **D: Ndị Soviet**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded Eastern Poland, violating agreements like the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other agreements. This act of invasion is a clear breach of those treaties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onye Polishi:** The passage describes Poland *being invaded*, not initiating aggression.
* **B: Ndị Rome:** The passage does not mention any actions by the Romans.
* **C: Ndị Ukraini:** While Ukraine was a territory occupied by the Soviets during the invasion, the passage indicates that the Soviet Union was the aggressor.



"
Ked ihe na anagha Reedi na andesta a nke?,"The correct answer is **B: Njide nke mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwụ (Occupation of eastern territories)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ihe karịrị ndị Sọviet Yunịọn Red Amị 800,000 banyere, kepụta ogige agha ndị Belarụs na Yukren, ka ha wakpochara akụkụ ọwụwa anyanwụ Poland"" (more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered, occupying the Belarusian and Ukrainian territories, and they occupied eastern Poland).  This clearly describes the occupation of eastern Polish territories by the Soviet Union.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ime nke Ukraine n'ihu (Advancement of Ukraine):** The passage doesn't talk about Ukraine advancing, but rather Soviet forces *occupying* Ukrainian territory.
* **C: Nhazịkọgharị n’akụkụ isi akwa mmiri (Reorganization around a water body):** This is not mentioned in the text. The reference to Romania is about a *plan* to retreat *towards* Romania, not reorganization near water.
* **D: ime mmebi iwu (Breaking the law):** While the actions were certainly illegal under international law, the *primary action described* is the territorial occupation.  The passage details *what* happened, not simply that it was unlawful.



"
Kedu ihe mere onye isi injinia nke Agha Iri nke Itali?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị Briten jisiri ike jide ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, onyeisiala mba Libya na onye nsote Mussolini nwụrụ site n'ọgbụgba nke ndị otu ya n'amaghị ama ka ọ na-achọ ịkwụsị na Tobruk. N'agha mberede n'ebe ọwụwa anyanwụ Bardia, ndị Britain jidere n'agha Onye isi Injinia nke Ndị agha Nke iri nke Italy, General Lastucci."" This directly says the British *captured* General Lastucci at Bardia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A kpọchiri ya na Fort Capuzzo:** Fort Capuzzo was captured *by the British*, not where Lastucci was captured.
*   **B: e mere ya na Tobruk:** Lastucci was captured at Bardia, not Tobruk.
*   **D: Ọkụ enyi ya nwụrụ:** This refers to Marshal Balbo, not General Lastucci."
Ebee ka Italo Balbo gafere?,"The correct answer is **B: Biritenu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na Juun 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, onyeisiala mba Libya na onye nsote Mussolini nwụrụ site n'ọgbụgba nke ndị otu ya n'amaghị ama ka ọ na-achọ ịkwụsị na Tobruk."" This translates to: ""On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the governor of Libya and Mussolini's deputy, died from being shot down by his own forces while trying to land at Tobruk.""

Tobruk was held by the British at the time. Thus, he died while trying to reach a location controlled by the British. The passage doesn't mention he died *in* Britain (Option B), but the *circumstances* of his death involve the British presence/control in the area.
"
"Kedu n'ime usoro ntụgharị uche ndị a bụ akụkụ dị oke mkpa nke okpukpe Buddha Tibet, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ịna-ahụ chị**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a key aspect of Tibetan Buddhist meditation is ""Deyiti Yoga,"" which involves **""ichepụta chi dị iche iche""** (creating different deities). This directly relates to visualizing deities as part of the meditative practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-emega ahụ́ gị** (Exercising your body) – While yoga (which includes physical postures) is *mentioned* as a source of influence, it's not the primary focus of the described meditation technique.
*   **B: Na-abụ abụ affirmations** (Singing affirmations) – The passage doesn't mention affirmations.
*   **D: ịmụta ọnọdụ yoga** (Learning yoga positions) – Similar to A, yoga is a background influence, not the core practice being described.



"
"""Kedu ka chakras si arụ ọrụ n'oge """"etiti"""" ntụgharị uche Tibet, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?""","The correct answer is **A: Site n’ọtụtụ ọnọdụ yoga**.

Here's why:

The text states that Buddhism Tibet uses Yoga Kundalini, and within that, chakras are *opened* through practices involving postures (yoga postchọ), breathing exercises, and visualization. These are all elements of yoga practice. The text directly links chakra opening to these methods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sitena ịna-ahụ chi:** While visualization of deities (chi) is mentioned, the text states the deities are *created* to work with the chakras, not that seeing them *is* how the chakras work.
*   **C: Mmegharị nke mantrasi:** Mantras aren't mentioned in relation to specifically activating chakras in this passage.
*   **D: Na-emega ahụ́ gị:** While yoga can benefit the body, the passage focuses on the energetic/spiritual aspect of chakra activation, not physical exercise alone.



"
Olee onye nyere egwụ ntụgharị uche nke abụọ na mmemme ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhari**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Onye ọgụ egwu Sanju Sharma bidoro na mgbede, **Jai Shankar Choudhary were sote ya**."" This means Jai Shankar Choudhary followed Sanju Sharma and therefore performed the second song.

"
"Ònye rụrụ abụ nsọpụrụ ofufe n’oge e ji achụ àjà ihe oriri, dị ka e si kwuo ya?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singhi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakkha Singh wee bido idu n'ịbụ abụ bajan gasị."" (Lakkha Singh then began singing bhajan songs) and ""Lakkha Singh gosirikwara chhappan bhog bhajan."" (Lakkha Singh also performed the Chhappan Bhog bhajan).  This clearly indicates Lakkha Singh was singing the devotional songs *during* the offering of the Chhappan Bhog.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jai Shankar Chọudhari:** He sang earlier in the event, but not during the Chhappan Bhog offering.
*   **C: Shri Shyamụ:** This is the deity being worshipped, not a singer.
*   **D: Sanju Shama:** He started the singing earlier in the evening.



"
Kedụ ihe bụ ikeọrụ ikpeazụ-abụọ nke mgbede?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandụrọ Safina na Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Onye Tọki diva Sezen Aksu mere emume ngosi ya na onye Itali ahụ tenor Alessandro Safina na ọgụ egwu onye Griik Haris Alexiou."" This directly identifies them as performing before the final act.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọkụ nke Anatolia:** This isn't mentioned as part of the two-to-last performance.
*   **C: Dervishes n'ọgba aghara:** These are mentioned earlier in the text but aren’t described as the second-to-last performance.
*   **D: Ma Fatih Erkoç na Müslüm Gürses:** They performed earlier in the show."
Kedu obodo Alessandro Safina si?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịtalian**.

The passage explicitly states ""onye Itali ahụ tenor Alessandro Safina"" which translates to ""the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina.""
"
"Ị kwenye na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n’ime ederede ndịa na-abụghị okwu ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **B: Ọ gbachidoro ndị mmadụ na kosta rola**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on extreme heat affecting passengers in Santa Clara.** It discusses the challenges of rescuing someone from a vehicle in 90-degree temperatures.
* **There is NO mention of people collapsing on the coast road (kosta rola).** This information is not found in the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: E nwere ọkụ ọgbụgba na Santa Clara** - The passage states ""Ọ bụ ụbọchị dị ọkụ n’ime Santa Clara ya na okpomọkụ nọ na 90s"" (It was a hot day in Santa Clara with temperatures in the 90s)
* **C: Enyere ndị njem mmiri ka ha ṅụọ** - While not explicitly stated, the context of extreme heat implies the need for hydration, so this is a reasonable inference.
* **D: O were opekatampe nkeji 60 iji kpọpụta onye izizi n’ụgbọ** - The passage states ""o wee dịkarịa ala otu awa iji wepụta onye mbụ n'ụgbọ ahụ"" (it took at least one hour to get the first person out of the vehicle).



"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee onye kwụrụ ụka gbasara ọkwa ekpomoku ọjọọ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: onye isi mgbanyụ ọkụ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Onyeisi ọkụ Scott Kouns kwuru..."" (Fire Chief Scott Kouns said...).  Scott Kouns is directly quoted expressing concern about the heat and the difficulties it poses for rescuing people from the car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onye ọkwọ ụgbọ:** The passage doesn't say the driver expressed an opinion.
* **C: Ndị na-eme njem:** The passage states that travelers are *affected* by the heat, but doesn't say they spoke about it.
* **D: onye uwe ojii kọmishọna:** The passage doesn't mention a police commissioner.



"
Ebee ka mfu ike metụtara tsunami mere?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""O nweghị nnukwu mmebi ma ọ bụ mmerụ ahụ akọrọna n’ime Tonga..."" which means there was no significant damage *in* Tonga, indicating that Tonga was affected by the tsunami. While Pago Pago and Niue experienced strong winds, the text explicitly mentions no damage in Tonga. The Hawaii schools were closed as a precaution, but didn't *experience* the effects of the tsunami itself.
"
"Mmetụta dị aṅaa ka nkwụsị ọkụ ahụ nwere na Tonga, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: A kọsaraghị ndị ọchịchị ịdọ aka ná ntị ahụ ewelitere**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""O nweghị nnukwu mmebi ma ọ bụ mmerụ ahụ akọrọna n’ime Tonga, mana e were ọkụ nwa oge, nke a kọrọ gbochiri ndị ọchịchị Tongan ịnata ịdọ aka na ntị maka ajọ ebili mmiri PTWC ahụ nyere."" This directly means the fire disrupted the Tongan authorities from receiving the warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A kọrọ mmebi na obere ego** - While there was *no significant* damage, saying it was reported as ""small damage"" isn't the core impact mentioned. The fire preventing the warning is more significant.
*   **C: Ọgụgụ nke oke osimiri gbanwere** - The text mentions waves but doesn't state they changed numbers/height.
*   **D: Enyeghị ndị ọchịchị ịdọ aka ná ntị ndị dị mkpa** - The warnings *were* issued, but the fire prevented the Tongan authorities from *receiving* them, which is different.

Kedu mgbe ndị uwe ojii nwere ike iji akụrụngwa radar ha tụọ ọsọ ịnya ụgbọ ala Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Na 160 km / h, ọ na-eme njem**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Maazị Reid jisiri ike nyaa ụgbọala a na-akpọ nwa mma dị oji bụ A1GP nke Niu Ziland, n'ogugo ọsọ nke 160km/h ugboro asaa gafee akwa mmiri ahụ."" This means the police were only able to get a reading when he was traveling at 160 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ gafere àkwà mmiri ahụ nke ugboro asaa** - This tells us *how many times* he did it, not *when* they could measure his speed.
*   **C: Ọ na-aga ihe karịrị 160 km / h** - The text doesn't confirm he ever went *over* 160 km/h, only *at* 160 km/h.
*   **D: Na mbufe ya nke mbu nke akwa mmiri** - This refers to the first time he crossed the bridge, but doesn't relate to when the police were able to get a radar reading.



"
Kedu ihe mere na onye mgbanye ọlaedo Olympic anọghị na-aṅụ ọgwụ maka ahụ mgbu ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịkwọ ụgbọ ala na ọsọ n'okpuru 160 km / h**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Jono Reid driving an A1GP car at 160km/h repeatedly across the Auckland Harbour Bridge. The question is seemingly a trick question, and the answer is the speed Reid was driving - the fact he was driving at high speed is the 'medicine' he's taking for his pain. It's a playful connection to the idea of thrill-seeking as a coping mechanism.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ụgbọ ala ahụ dị obere** - The passage mentions the car is called ""Black Beauty"" but doesn't state it's small.
*   **C: Naanị ugboro asaa ka ọ kwọ ụgbọala gafee àkwà mmiri ahụ** - The number of times isn't relevant to why someone might not take medicine.
*   **D: Nke kacha ochie bụ akwa mmiri Auckland Harbor** - The age of the bridge isn't relevant either.



"
Kedu ebe dị anya site na Butte bụ etiti ala ọma jijiji ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: n'ebe ndịda 40 kilomita**.

The text states the epicenter was approximately 65 km (40 miles) *south* of Butte."
Kedu ihe mere na ọgba aghara Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: mmeso ọjọọ nke ndị mkpọrọ** (torture of prisoners).

Here's why:

The passage states the prison became notorious *after* evidence of prisoner abuse by US soldiers was discovered. This means the defining event of the Abu Ghraib scandal was the mistreatment and torture of prisoners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: nkpọrọ naanị ya** (only imprisonment) - Imprisonment itself isn't what made Abu Ghraib infamous.
*   **C: Ndị ọrụ agha US weghaara** (US soldiers took over) - While true, this is just the background, not the key event.
*   **D: A gbara ọkụ n'ime ụlọ mkpọrọ ahụ** (The prison was set on fire) - The passage states it was damaged during a riot, but doesn't highlight this as the central issue. The abuse is the main focus.



"
Gịnị mere e ji mara ụlọ mkpọrọ Iraq nke ọma? ,"The correct answer is **D: ịchọta ihe akaebe nke mmetọ ndị mkpọrọ** (finding evidence of prisoner abuse).

Here's why:

The passage states the prison became notorious *after* evidence of prisoner abuse was discovered.  While the prison was also damaged by fire and occupied by US forces, those facts aren't the reason it became so well-known.  It's the abuse that made it infamous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agbanyere ya ọkụ** (It was set on fire) - While true, the fire wasn't *why* it became famous.
*   **B: Ndị agha US weghaara ngalaba** (US forces took over the section) - Again, this happened, but isn’t the main reason for its notoriety.
*   **C: Ọnụọgụ ọgba aghara ahụ dị elu** (The number of riots was high) - The passage mentions ""an uprising"" (singular), not necessarily a high number of them, and doesn't say this is why it's well-known.



"
Olee ụdị ememme e mere ndokwa ka e mee n’ámá egwuregwu Ncheta Agha Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: ngosi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the group ""cancelled the **show** at Maui's War Memorial Stadium, which was to be attended by 9,000 people."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ngosi nke anwansi** - While ""ngosi"" means ""show,"" adding ""of spiders"" isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Egwuregwu bọọlụ** - The passage doesn't mention football.
*   **D: bazaa** - The passage doesn't mention a bazaar."
Ònye mechara nye nkwado maka ịkagbu mmemme ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Ụlọ ọrụ nlekọta òtù nkwa egwu ahụ, bụ HK Management Inc., enyeghị nkọwa nke izizi mgbe ha kagburu..."" This directly indicates the management company (the operating company) was the one who cancelled the event and later offered an explanation (logistical issues).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eriri:** The text doesn’t mention any artists offering support for the cancellation.
*   **C: Onye nwe ama egwuregwu ncheta agha:** The text doesn't mention the owner of the stadium giving a reason for the cancellation.
*   **D: Ndị nkwado ahụ:** The cancellation was *done to* the fans and they were apologized *to*, they didn't support the cancellation.



"
Kedu onye ụfọdụ ụmụ amaala Bishkek kwenyere na ọ bụ ya kpatara ịkwakọrọ ihe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị na-eme ngagharị iwe**.

The passage states: ""Otutu ndi bi na Bishkek tara ndi na-eme ngaghari iwe si na odida anyanwu uta gbasara imebi iwu"" which translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed protesters for violating the law.""

Therefore, the residents believed the **protesters (ndị na-eme ngagharị iwe)** were responsible for the unrest.
"
Kedu onye kenyere ndị ngagharị iwe maka izu ohi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụmụ amaala Bishkek**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Otutu ndi bi na Bishkek tara ndi na-eme ngaghari iwe si na odida anyanwu uta gbasara imebi iwu"" which translates to ""Many Bishkek residents blamed the protesters for the looting."" 

This directly indicates that the residents of Bishkek were the ones assigning blame for the looting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị ọchịchị na iwu (Law enforcement)** - The passage states they *weren't* present, so they didn't blame anyone.
*   **C: Ndị ọgba aghara (The rioters)** - They wouldn't blame themselves.
*   **D: Otu òtù (A group)** - The passage doesn't mention any specific group being blamed by the protesters."
Kedu mgbe Ring hụrụ ịrị elu na azụmaahịa?,"The correct answer is **A: Na-esote arụmọrụ na Shark tank**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ring dozikwara otu ikpe ha na ụlọ ọrụ ọzọ na-ahụ maka nchekwa, ADT Corporation nwere."" and ""orire ahịa gbaliri elu ka ogosichara n'ihe nkiri Shak Tank n'afọ 2013 ebe ndị ndozi ihe ngosi jụrụ itinye ego na mbido."" This clearly indicates the business boomed *after* the Shark Tank appearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: N'ịbụ onye nwetara ego na 2013:** The passage specifically states investors *rejected* funding Ring on Shark Tank, so this is wrong.
*   **C: na-eso a arụmọrụ na QVC:** While QVC exposure happened later, the initial surge in sales was directly linked to Shark Tank.
*   **D: Mgbe e kpechara ikpe megide ADT:** The passage mentions the lawsuit, but doesn't state it caused a business surge.



"
Kedu mgbe Jamie Simoff mere mkpebi ịmalite Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: chọpụtara mgbịrịgba ọnụ ụzọ nke ya anaghị ada ụda nke ukwuu** (When he realized his doorbell didn't ring loudly enough).

The passage states Jamie Siminoff started working on Ring *after* he couldn't hear his doorbell while in his garage. This is the impetus for the creation of the product. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na-esote arụmọrụ Shark tank na-akụda mmụọ** (Following a disappointing Shark Tank performance) - While Shark Tank did boost sales *later*, it wasn't the initial trigger for starting the company.
* **C: N'inweta ego** (In getting funding) - He started before receiving funding, and was rejected on Shark Tank initially.
* **D: Na-eso mpụta QVC na-arụpụta ihe** (Following a QVC appearance) - QVC came *much* later, in 2017, after the company was already established.



"
Kedu ihe e nyere ụmụaka na mmemme Ọgụgụ Rainbow ọ bụla?,"The correct answer is **D: Akwụkwọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Each segment of the show would focus on one topic within a designated book and then explore that topic through multiple stories. Each show would also provide suggestions for books that children should look for when they went to their libraries.""

This clearly indicates that *books* were a central element provided to children through each episode of Reading Rainbow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihe omume telivishọn (Television programs):** While *Reading Rainbow* *was* a television program, the question asks what was *given* to children *through* the program.
*   **B: ụlọ akwụkwọ dị nso (Nearby schools):** The passage mentions libraries, not schools.
*   **C: Gburugburu (Environment):** The show may have touched on environmental topics, but that wasn't the core offering to children."
Gịnị kpatara na a kagbuola usoro ihe onyonyo nke Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **A: ezughị oke akụrụngwa** (insufficient funding).

The text states: ""Ụfọdụ, tinyere Jọn Grant, kwenyere na mbelata mbinye ego na mgbanwe na nka ihe ọmụma gbasara ndozi ihe ngosi nkuzi ihe so weta maka njedebe ihe ngosi ahụ."" This translates to ""Some, including John Grant, believed that reduced funding and changes in the educational arts landscape led to the show's cancellation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: enweghị Emmys nyere ya** (no Emmys given to it): The text says it *won* many Emmys, not that it didn't receive any.
*   **C: echiche nke John Grant** (John Grant's idea): While John Grant is quoted, the text says the cancellation was due to funding cuts *and* changes in the educational landscape – it wasn't his idea to cancel the show.
*   **D: Ogbe Mister Rogers kụrụ** (Mister Rogers struck): The text mentions *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood* as a comparison for length, but doesn't suggest any conflict or involvement in *Reading Rainbow*'s cancellation.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe nchebe nke ndị nnọchiteanya Amsterdam na ụlọ ihe ngosi nka nyere banyere osisi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekwesịrị idowe ya**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the city and museum argued the tree was diseased and a public safety hazard *because* it could fall.** They didn't argue it *should* be preserved. They wanted to remove it.
*   **A:** ""N'enweghị mgbagha, ọ ga-ada"" - This is stated in the passage.
*   **C:** ""Ọ nwere ọrịa fungal"" - The passage specifically mentions the tree has a fungal disease.
*   **D:** ""Ọ na-etinye ihe ize ndụ nye ahụike onye ọ bụla"" - The passage says it poses a risk to public safety, which includes health.

Therefore, the only statement *not* made as a reason by the representatives is that the tree should be preserved."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kwesịrị ịga nyocha oge niile, dịka onye nleba anya kacha elu nke RSPCA siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Sistemụ CCTV**.

Here's why:

The text states David O'Shannessy believes ""nleba-anya na nyocha nke ulo-igbu-anu kwesiri idi kwa-mgbe na Australia"" and that this would be achieved by installing CCTV cameras. This directly links the need for constant inspection to the CCTV system itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Onye ọ bụla na-eji anụmanụ eme ihe:** While the concern is about animal welfare relating to people handling animals, the text specifies the *method* of monitoring is CCTV, not scrutinizing individuals.
*   **C: Akụrụngwa onyunyo:** The text doesn't mention torture equipment.
*   **D: Ndị na-eri anụ:** The text focuses on the conditions *within* slaughterhouses, not on those who consume the animals.

"Kedu ihe ga-enyere ndị na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ anụ ụlọ n'Australia aka ịghọta uru nlekọta anụ ụlọ dị, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Nhazi nke igwefoto CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the RSPCA is advocating for CCTV cameras to be installed in *all* Australian slaughterhouses. David O'Shannessy says the cameras would send a ""strong message"" to people working in slaughterhouses that animal welfare is a priority.  This directly suggests the cameras will help those workers understand the importance of animal welfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nzukọ RSPCA nke achọrọ** - The RSPCA *wanting* it doesn't inherently help workers understand welfare.
*   **C: Nlele oge niile nke ụlọ anụ** - While the passage mentions regular inspections, the *cameras* are the proposed method for achieving this.
*   **D: Nlekọta nke ABC** - ABC is reporting the news; they aren't a method for changing worker understanding.



"
"Gịnị ka onye ahụ e jidere na-eme, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: onye mmụta** (student).

The passage states ""and another student was taken into custody for statements regarding bullying that occurred at the school on March 21st."" 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The person who spoke to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune was a *source* for the newspaper, not a writer.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention a president.
* **D:** The person taken into custody is a student, not a tribal leader.



"
"A na-eme olili ozu mmadụ ole, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo, mgbe akụkọ gbasara njide ọzọ gbasara?","The correct answer is **A: Otu**.

The text states: ""Akụkọ gbasara n'ime obodo Red Lek taa dịka a na eme olili ozu Jeff Weise na mmadụ atọ ọzọ..."" This means the story is about a vigil for Jeff Weise *and* three others, making a total of one vigil (for Weise) mentioned in connection with the new arrests.
"
Kedu mba kpebiri na ha agaghị emejuputa nkwekọrịta ACTA mgbe ngagharị iwe ahụ gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **B: Polandị**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Na Poland mgbe obodo a nyere ACTA nkwenye ha, nke mere ka gọọmenti Poland kpebie na ha ka ga-echere tupu ha asị nkwekọrịta ahụ gaa n'ihu.."" This means the Polish government decided to delay ACTA ratification *after* protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Germani:** The text mentions protests in German cities but doesn't say Germany halted ACTA implementation.
*   **C: Scotland:** The text states protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow, but not that Scotland halted ACTA.
*   **D: Lithuania:** The text only mentions protests in Vilnius, Lithuania, not a decision about ACTA implementation.

Latvia and Slovakia *delayed* the process of joining ACTA, but Poland specifically decided to wait before proceeding. Therefore, Poland is the correct answer."
Kedu mba ahọrọghị imejuputa nkwekọrịta ACTA ha bịanyere aka na nzaghachi maka ngagharị iwe ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ma Latvia ma Slovakia egbuola oge nke usoro isonyere ACTA."" This translates to ""Both Latvia and Slovakia have stalled the process of ratifying ACTA."" This means they haven't implemented the agreement in response to the protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia** - The text mentions protests in Tallinn (Estonia), but doesn't say they halted ACTA ratification.
*   **B: Lithuania** - The text mentions protests in Vilnius (Lithuania), but doesn't say they halted ACTA ratification.
*   **C: Scotland** - While protests occurred in Scotland, it's part of the UK, and the text doesn't mention the UK halting ACTA ratification.



"
Ole ihe omume nke ikpo oke ọkụ iPod butere mmerụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: 6**.

The passage states: ""E kwuputala na na e nweela nsogbu 60 sitere na iPods ndị n'anaghị arụ ọrụ ọma na-ekwo oke ọkụ, nke na-ebutala ọkụ ọgbụgba isii merụrụ ndị mmadụ ahụ obere.""  This translates to ""It has been reported that there have been 60 problems from iPods that are not working properly overheating, which has caused six fires injuring people slightly.""
"
Ònye kwuru na ikpe ekpo oke ọkụ adịghị mkpa n'ezie?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Apple called them 'non-issues'"". This directly indicates that Apple downplayed the overheating incidents, essentially saying they weren't important.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: METI:** METI acknowledged the incidents and expressed displeasure with Apple's delayed reporting. They *didn't* say the overheating wasn't important.
*   **B: Ndị ọrụ iPod nwere nsogbu:** The text doesn’t mention anyone who has issues with the iPods saying the issue isn’t important.
*   **C: Ngalaba mgbanyụ ọkụ nke Japan:** The text does not mention a fire department.



"
"N'okwu ya, Steve Jobs kwuru na Apple ga-agbanwe gịnị?","The correct answer is **B: Ekwentị mkpanaaka** (Mobile phones).

Here's why:

The passage directly states Steve Jobs said, ""Taa Apple ga-agbanwe **ekwentị** dị ka ụwa si mara ya"" which translates to ""Today Apple will change **phones** as the world knows them"".  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gara aga anyị** (Our past) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: The azụmahịa** (The business) - While the iPhone did impact Apple's business, the direct quote focuses on phones.
*   **D: Ihe ohuru ohuru** (New things) - Too broad. The quote is specifically about phones."
Gịnị mere Steve Jobs ji kwuo okwu were awa abụọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-ewepụta ekwentị ọhụrụ**.

The passage explicitly states Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone during his two-hour speech. He said Apple would ""change phones as the world knows them,"" clearly indicating the speech was about a new phone release.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntọhapụ nke ọhụrụ mbadamba (Release of a new software):** The passage focuses on a physical device, the iPhone, not software.
*   **B: Webata kọmpụta ọhụrụ (Introducing a new computer):** The passage specifically mentions a phone.
*   **D: Akụkọ banyere ezumike nka ya (Stories about his artistic retirement):** The passage describes a product launch, not a retirement announcement.



"
"N'ụlọ ihe nkiri Argentine, gịnị ka Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kwupụtara?","The correct answer is **A: Ọkwa ya maka ịzọ ọkwa onyeisiala** (Her candidacy for the presidency).

The passage explicitly states that ""Lọọlọ Kirchner kwuputara ebumnuche ya ịzọ maka ọkwa onye isi ala"" (Kirchner announced her intention to run for the presidency) at the Argentine Theater.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ na-ezube ịzọ ọkwa Sineti** (She intends to run for Senate) - While she *previously* ran for Senate in 2005, the text focuses on her current declaration for the presidency.
* **C: Ọ gbara ọsọ maka ndị ozi mpaghara Buenos Aires** (She ran for Buenos Aires regional officials) - The text mentions this as her campaign start in 2005, not her current announcement.
* **D: Ebumnuche ya ịhapụ ọkwa ya dịka onye sinetọ** (Her intention to resign her position as senator) - The text doesn't mention anything about resigning.



"
Kedu ebe Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kwuputara ọkwa ya?,"The correct answer is **C: 31 kilomita site na Buenos Aires, na ụlọ ihe nkiri Argentine**.

Here's why:

* The passage states she announced her candidacy in La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
* It also specifies it was at the *Argentina Theatre* (Ajentaịn Tiyeta).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect because it says ""31 miles from La Plata"" instead of Buenos Aires.
* **B:** Incorrect because La Plata is a separate city from Buenos Aires.
* **D:** Incorrect because she announced it in La Plata, not Buenos Aires.



"
Kedu ihe ACMA kwubiri na Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ nweghị mmebi nke iwu nyocha emebeghị** (No breach of the investigation law was made).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndi ACMA chọpụtarakwara na n'agbanyeghị na a na elere ya n'ịntaneetị, ihe onyonyoo Big Brọda emebighị iwu gbasara nyocha na mmachi ihe ngosi n'ịntaneetị..."" This translates to ""ACMA also found that despite being aired online, Big Brother's footage did not violate laws regarding investigations and restrictions of content online...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Achọpụtara na webụsaịtị Big Brother nwere mgbasa ozi** (It was found that the Big Brother website had a broadcast) - The passage states the footage *wasn't* hosted on the Big Brother website.
*   **C: E mebiri iwu na-achịkwa nyocha** (The law governing investigations was violated) - The passage explicitly states the law was *not* violated.
*   **D: Ebe anụ ahụ nke sava ebe achọpụtara ọdịnaya bụ** (The physical location of the server where the content was found) - The passage mentions the content needed to be physically on a server, but doesn't specify its location.



"
Kedu ihe a chọrọ ka mgbasa ozi ga-egbo ka ewee ya dị ka ọdịnaya ịntanetị?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekwesịrị ịgbanye ya n'ịntanetị** (It must be broadcast on the internet).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states, ""Iwu Ọrụ Mgbasa ozi ahụ na-enye maka njikwa nke ndị̀na ịntaneetị,"" meaning the broadcasting regulations apply to internet content.  Further, it implies that the *act* of broadcasting online is what triggers the regulations, rather than simply storing the content on a website.  The example of Big Brother content not being on their website but still not violating the law illustrates this point - the show was *broadcast* online.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ ga-adịrịrị na nkesa** (It must be distributed) - Distribution is broader than broadcasting.
*   **C: A naghị ekwe ka idowe ya n'ịntanetị** (It is not allowed to be stored online) - The text specifically says the opposite: the *lack* of storage on the Big Brother website didn’t excuse the broadcasting.
*   **D: ACMA ga-anabatarịrị ya** (ACMA must approve it) - The text doesn't mention needing approval from ACMA; it focuses on the act of broadcasting itself.



"
Kedu onye na-edu Liberal Party of Australia?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The passage states: ""Pita Kostello, Onye Ndokwa akụ Ọstrelia na onye a na-ele anya ga-anọchi Praịm Minista Jọn Howard dịka onye isi otu ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị Libral..."" This means Peter Costello is poised to *replace* John Howard as the leader of the Liberal Party. Therefore, at the time of this statement, he is expected to be the leader."
Kedu ihe kpatara na enweghị azụmahịa ike nuklia na Australia ugbua??,"The correct answer is **A: Ọha na-amasịghị ya (Public opposition)**.

The passage states, ""There is no consensus for nuclear power Mr. Costello said."" This implies the reason there isn't a nuclear industry in Australia isn't technical (cost, safety, uncertainty) but rather a lack of public agreement or support – meaning public opposition. While the other options *could* be contributing factors, the text directly points to a lack of consensus, which equates to public disapproval.



"
Kedu skier ji ntuziaka n'oge asọmpi ahụ niile?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Onye Poland kpuri isi bụ Maciej Krezel na-egwu egwuregwu ski, na onye ndu ya Anna Ogarzynska mechara onye nke iri na atọ na asọm mpi Supa-G."" This explicitly states Anna Ogarzynska was the guide for the Polish skier Maciej Krezel throughout the competition.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** was a skier competing individually.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** was a skier competing individually.
*   **C: Maciej Krezel** was the skier *being guided*, not the guide.



"
"Na Super-G maka ọkwa ụmụ nwanyị, kedụ mba bịara n'ụzọ iri?","The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The text states: ""Anna Jochemsen, of the Netherlands, finished ninth in the women's Super-G race yesterday.""

Therefore, the Netherlands is the country that came in ninth place in the women's Super-G."
"Kedu nkwupụta gbasara Blake bụ ihe na-abụghị eziokwu, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: O were mkpara n’aka wakpoo**.

Here's why:

The passage states Blake was *attacked* with bottles by a group of 13 people. It doesn't say he attacked anyone with a weapon.  It states he used a pole to *defend* himself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'ebe ahụ, a kpọchiri ya** - The passage states he was sentenced to prison, confirming he was detained.
*   **B: O kwetara iku ọrụ ahụ.** - The passage mentions he was convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice, implying he took actions related to the case, essentially accepting some responsibility.
*   **D: O kwuputara na ọ bụ ya bụ onye a tụrụ atụba karama** - The passage does not state this at all. It says he was *attacked* with bottles.



"
"Dabere na ngalaba ahụ, Blake ahụghị nke n'ime ndị a?","The correct answer is **C: E ji mkpanaka tie ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states Blake was sentenced for *attempting to pervert the course of justice* and was told he'd likely be imprisoned (""ana aga itinye ya na nga""). It also mentions he used pepper spray to defend himself. However, there is **no mention** of him being stabbed with a knife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'ihi iji ikpe ziri ezi eme ihe n'ụzọ na-ezighị ezi, a mara ya ikpe** - This is a restatement of the reason for his sentencing, not something he *experienced*.
*   **B: A kpọgara ya n’ụlọ mkpọrọ** - The passage states he will likely be imprisoned, but doesn't say he *has been* yet.
*   **D: A gwara ya na o yikarịrị ka a ga-ejide ya** - This is also stated in the passage, but isn't an experience he had in the sense of physical harm.



"
Kedu ebumnuche nke United Nations agaghị etinye ego maka ikpo ọkụ zuru ụwa ọnụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Mba na-apụta na teknụzụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the UN hopes to fund:

*   **Flood-resistant houses** (Ebe obibi nwere ike iguzogide idei mmiri)
*   **Improved irrigation** (Njikwa dọtị ka mma)
*   **Diversified crops** (Ọkụkụ ihe dị iche iche)

These all relate to adaptation to climate change.  The passage also implies funding to help countries *cope* with the effects of climate change.

While climate change is about more than just agriculture (Ihe ubi mgbanwe), and reducing global warming (Mbelata nke okpomọkụ zuru ụwa ọnụ pụta) are important goals, the passage's focus is on helping countries *adapt* to the current and near-future impacts, not on funding technology development in developed countries. The passage focuses on helping *vulnerable* nations.



Therefore, funding ""countries emerging with technology"" (Mba na-apụta na teknụzụ) doesn't fit the stated goals of the UN funding described in the passage."
"Kedu ihe UN na-ezube ịchekwa, dabere n'akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Oke mmiri ozuzo ka dị adị**.

Here's why:

The passage states the UN hopes to fund things like ""ụlọ ndị mmiri anaghi ebu"" (flood-proof houses), ""njikwa dọtị ka mma"" (better drainage management), and various ""ọkụkụ ihe dị iche iche"" (various infrastructure).  All of these are aimed at *mitigating the effects of flooding* and helping countries deal with climate change related water issues. Therefore, the UN is trying to protect remaining water reserves and manage existing ones better.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ime ego site na teknụzụ nkesa** - The passage mentions funding, but doesn't focus on making money *from* distribution technology.
*   **B: Ngwaahịa ugbo** - Agriculture isn't specifically mentioned in the context of the UN's efforts.
*   **D: Ndị nlekọta mmiri na-ezughị ezu na-emetụta** - While water management is mentioned, the focus isn't solely on a lack of personnel, but rather improving infrastructure and resilience.



"
Kedụ n’ime ihe ndịa ka Albert Muchanga na-ekwughi dika ihe ekwesiri ka ekwere na ya?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụbọchị azụmahịa nwere ike bido**.

Here's why:

*   **Albert Muchanga stated, ""our arrangements are sufficient to start trading by July 1, 2020"".** This directly indicates his confidence that trade can begin on that date.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ma ọbụrụna Benin ga-esonye AfCTA** - He *announced* Benin would join, he didn't present it as something to believe or disbelieve.
*   **C: Iwu nke ntọala** - He explicitly stated they *haven't* reached an agreement on rules of origin.
*   **D: Okwu nnabata tarifu** - Similar to rules of origin, he said there was no agreement on tariffs.

"Gịnị kpatara ịzụ ahịa nwere ike ịmalite na Julaị, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Usoro iwu na ebe obibi dị adị zuru oke**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…atụmatụ anyị nwere zuru oke iji malite zụwa ahịa na Julaị 1, 2020."" This directly means that the existing plans and legal frameworks were deemed sufficient to begin trading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says Nigeria *aims* to join AfCFTA, it doesn't say their desires *cause* trading to begin.
* **C:** The Commissioner's support is mentioned, but doesn't explain *why* trading could start.
* **D:** The passage specifically says they *haven't* reached agreements on rules of origin and import duty. This contradicts option D.

Kedu ihe bụ akwụkwọ akụkọ Atlanta-Constitution boro ebubo ebubo ebubo na ndị ọrụ agụmakwụkwọ na-agụ akwụkwọ na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-ajụ ileba anya n'ime nsogbu ndị achọpụtara**.

Here's why:

The passage states that documents from the Atlanta school system showed problems with test scores, and that schools *knew* about these problems but ""did nothing with the findings."" This directly aligns with the accusation of refusing to look into identified issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbanwe na akụkọ Journal-Constitution:** The passage doesn't mention changes in reporting.
*   **B: Ụlọ akwụkwọ n'ime obodo abụghị ihe ọhụrụ:** While corruption might not be *new*, the passage focuses on this specific case.
*   **D: Na-akọpụta nsonaazụ ule adịghị ike:** The passage states the test scores were manipulated, not simply that weak results were being reported.



"
"Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ Atlanta Journal-Constitution, n'ihi eziokwu ndị e nyere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe akaebe na agbanweela mpempe ule** (Evidence that test scores were altered).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ihe akaebe mechara gosi na emetụrụ akwụkwọ ule ndị ahụ aka."" (Evidence eventually showed that the test scores were manipulated.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmụba na-adịghị ahụkebe na arụmọrụ ule** (Unusual increases in test performance) - While the passage mentions improved test scores initially, it clarifies those were due to cheating. The *increase itself* isn't what's missing from reporting, but the *reason* for it.
* **C: Onye isi ala nke afọ maka 2013** (Superintendent of the year for 2013) - The passage states Hall was National Superintendent of the *year in 2009*, not 2013.
* **D: Echiche maka imeziwanye ụlọ akwụkwọ n'obodo mepere emepe** (Ideas for improving schools in an open city) - The passage focuses on a scandal, not ideas for improvement.

"Kedu ozi a maara ugbu a n'ihe gbasara ogbunigwe ahụ, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ọnyá** (The number of explosions).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states ""Otu ogbunigwe gbawara..."" (One explosion occurred...) and then ""...Ogbunigwe atọ ọzọ gbara..."" (Three more explosions occurred...). The main information given is about the *number* of explosions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nke ụlọ ndị dị nso mgbe ihe mgbawa gbawara** (Which buildings were near when the explosions happened) - The passage mentions the presidential palace and a government building, but doesn't focus on *which* buildings were nearby.
*   **C: Ọ bụrụ na bọmbụ ọzọ ga-agbapụ** (If another bomb will explode) - The passage doesn't predict future explosions.
*   **D: ọnụ ọgụgụ gọọmentị nke ndị nwụrụ anwụ** (The government's count of the dead) - While the passage *mentions* different casualty reports, it's not the central information the passage provides. It's focusing on the event of explosions.

Kedu ọnụọgụgụ egwuregwu Jizọs sonyere na ya kemgbe ọ sonyeere Manchester City na 2017?,"The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Kemgbe ahụ, onye Brazil a agbaala n'egwuregwu 53 maka klọb a n'asọmpi niile..."" (Since then, the Brazilian has played in 53 games for the club in all competitions...).

The question asks about the number of games Jesus played for Manchester City *since* joining in 2017. The text directly states he has played 53 games."
Kedu otu Jizọs kwụrụ ụgwọ mmalite £27 nde?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

Here's why:

The passage states Jesus was bought *from* Palmeiras for £27 million.  Therefore, Palmeiras is where the initial £27 million came *from*.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

* **B: Manchester City** - Manchester City *paid* the £27 million, they didn't receive it.
* **C: Cruzeiro** - This club isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Manchester United** - This club isn't mentioned in the text."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara ndị ọbịa ụlọ mbikọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọtụtụ ndị bịaranụ si n’obodo nsọ ahụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndị na-abịakarị n'ụlọ mbinigwe ahụ bụ ndị mba Yunaịtedị Arabụ Emireti"" (Most visitors to the hotel are from the United Arab Emirates). This directly contradicts the statement that many visitors are from the holy city itself (Mecca).

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

* **A: Ndị ọbịa ahụ bụ ndị njem ala nsọ na Mecca** - The passage says ""Ụfọdụ ndị njem ala nsọ bịara ịhụ obodo nsọ n'abalị na-esote hajj"" (Some pilgrims came to see the holy city the night after Hajj), so this is true.
* **B: Ụfọdụ ndị ọbịa esighị n'ógbè ahụ** - The passage implies they are visitors, meaning they don't necessarily live there. This is true.
* **C: Ndị ọbịa bịara n'abalị ụbọchị hajj** - The passage states ""Ndị njem ala nsọ bịara ịhụ obodo nsọ n'abalị na-esote hajj"" (The pilgrims came to see the holy city the night after Hajj) so this is true.



"
Kedu nke ziri ezi n'ime okwu ndị a dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọbịa ahụ rutere n'abalị nke njem Hajj**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ụfọdụ ndị njem ala nsọ bịara ịhụ obodo nsọ n'abalị na-esote hajj nọrọ n'ụlọ a."" This directly translates to ""Some pilgrims came to see the holy city the night after Hajj and stayed at the house.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọ dịghị onye nwụrụ** - The text mentions ""onụ ogugu ndi nwuru-anwu di opekata-mpe 15"" which means ""at least 15 deaths occurred.""  So this is false.
* **B: Ndị bi na United Arab Emirates mejupụtara ndị niile bịara ya** - The text says ""Ndị na-abịakarị n'ụlọ mbinigwe ahụ bụ ndị mba Yunaịtedị Arabụ Emireti"" (Most people who come to the hotel are from the United Arab Emirates). This means they are *most* of the guests, not *all* of them.
* **D: Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị bịara ya bụ ụmụ amaala Mecca** - The text doesn't provide any information about the origin of the pilgrims beyond mentioning the UAE.

Kedu nkọwa nke mkpọka ahụ na-enweghị mgbagwoju anya n'ihe gbasara akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Oke nke nkukota**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states ""mgbasa nkụkọta isi ahụ butere dị ukwu"" (the extent of the impact was significant) and mentions scientists are trying to determine ""etu ibu mkpọka ahụ dị"" (how large the impact body is). This directly relates to the *size* or *extent* of the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ebe ihe mberede ahụ mere** (Where the incident happened) - While the passage mentions ""elu Eluụwa"" (Hawaii), the main focus isn't *where* it happened, but the impact itself.
*   **C: Mmeghachi omume ụwa maka nkukota ahụ** (The world's reaction to the impact) - The passage only mentions monitoring by the US Strategic Command and further analysis being conducted, not broader global reactions.
*   **D: Ebe ihe mkpofu dị** (Where the debris is) - The passage only states data will be available on a public website, not where the debris is located.



"
"Kedu ihe amabeghị gbasara nkukota a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ziri ezi nke nkukota ahụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ha ka na anwale ịchọpụta etu ibu mkpọka ahụ dị..."" (They are still trying to determine the mass of the debris). This directly indicates that the exact mass is unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kedu onye ga-ahụ maka ịchụ nta ihe** - The text does not discuss who will handle the debris.
*   **B: ọsọ nke Satellites na-aga tupu ha agbaa** - The passage states the satellites were travelling at 17,500 mph, so their speed is known.
*   **C: Otu a ga-esi akọwapụta nsonaazụ nyocha site na nkata** - While the passage mentions results will be posted on a public website, it doesn't ask *how* the results will be explained.

"
Kedu nke Batten nyere n'ime ihe ndị a?,"The correct answer is **B: Mahadum Virginia**.

The text states that Batten was a prominent donor to the university. While he also achieved wealth (A) and went to a university focused on arts and sciences (D), the direct contribution mentioned is to the University of Virginia. Option C is irrelevant."
Kedu ihe ụgwọ Gọvanọ Arnold Schwarzenegger agụnyeghị?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmachi mba ofesi na ire ma ọ bụ mgbazinye egwuregwu vidiyo ime ihe ike nye ụmụaka**.

The passage only discusses regulations *within* California. It doesn't mention any impact on international sales or distribution. The other options are all explicitly stated in the text:

*   **A** is stated: prohibiting the renting or selling of violent video games to children.
*   **B** is stated: a $1000 fine for violations.
*   **D** is stated: requiring an ""18"" label on violent video games.

"Kedu onye tụfuru ihe a na-ekwu, dabere na akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Mike**.

Here's why:

The passage states Mila said, """"Mike na-ekwu ọtụtụ okwu mgbe a na-eme ọnụnụ ahụ...anọ m na-akwado ya mere na anụghị m ihe ọ na-ekwu."""" This directly implies Mike was talking a lot, and Mila was distracted supporting him, meaning *he* was the one doing the talking and therefore, potentially, losing the point. The question asks who ""lost the point"" or ""tufuru ihe a na-ekwu.""
"
"Dabere na paragraf ahụ, kedụ n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara ahụmịhe ntị Miller ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **B: Ka ọ nọ na-akwado, o yiri ka o nweghị mmasị**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Mila said, """"Mike was talking a lot during the commission... I was supporting him so I didn't hear what he was saying."""""" This directly implies that while she was *with* Mike, her focus was on supporting him, not actively listening to what he said. This makes her seem disinterested in the content of his testimony.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N'oge a na-ege ntị, Duvall hapụrụ mmetụta na Miller:** The paragraph doesn't mention Duvall leaving an impression on Miller. It’s about Miller’s account.
* **C: N'ime oge ikpe a, ụmụ Duvall abụọ kwuru ọtụtụ ihe:** The paragraph only mentions Duval and Miller. It doesn’t mention Duvall's children speaking.
* **D: Ọ nọ na-ege ntị nke ọma n'ihe Duvall na-ekwu:** The paragraph *explicitly* states the opposite – she didn't hear what was being said because she was supporting him.



"
"""Onye nyere aro ka agbanwee """"Iwube ikuku dị ọcha""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Layton arịọla maka mgbanwe nye akwụkwọ iwu gburugburu ebe obibi nke ndị otu ọdịkaọgadị..."" which translates to ""Layton has requested changes to the environmental regulations of the coalition parties..."". This clearly indicates Jack Layton proposed changes to the ""Clean Air Act"" (which is what ""Iwube ikuku dị ọcha"" translates to).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: John Howard:** The text states Howard *defended* the action regarding the Mersey hospital, not that he proposed changes to the Clean Air Act.
*   **B: Otu Republican:** The text doesn't mention a Republican party or any suggestions from them.
*   **D: Stephen Harper:** While Harper agreed to meet with Layton, the text says Layton *requested* the changes, not Harper.



"
"""Kedu onye rụrụ ụka nkwuputa na """"Clean Air Act"""" bụ gimmick tupu ntuli aka?""","The correct answer is **D: Onye omebe iwu etiti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""gọọmenti steeti na ụfọdụ ndị ome iwu gọọmenti etiti ekwuola okwu megide omume a sị na ọ bụ mere mere n'ihu maka ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị gọọmenti etiti na-abịa na Nọvemba."" This translates to: ""state governments and some **federal members of parliament** have spoken out against the action, saying it was a ploy in the run-up to the upcoming federal election in November.""

The ""Clean Air Act"" is referenced in relation to this political timing, so it was federal members of parliament who made the claim that it was a gimmick.



"
"Mgbe ihe melamine na cyanuric acid na-emeghachi omume na mmamịrị nwamba, gịnị si na ya pụta?","The correct answer is **C: Crystals**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The combination of crystals was found in the kidneys of the affected animals, as seen by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)."" It explicitly says the reaction between melamine and cyanuric acid *forms* these crystals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akụrụ (Kidneys):** The crystals are *found in* the kidneys, they aren't what's produced by the reaction itself.
*   **B: Nri nkịta (Dog food):** The reaction happens *in* the pet food, but the food isn't the product of the reaction.
*   **D: Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR):** FTIR is a method used to *detect* the crystals, not what is created.



"
Gịnị bụ ihe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị pụrụ ịhụ na-eji infrared spectroscopy?,"The correct answer is **C: Emetụta anụmanụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...the mixture of crystals were found in the feed of the affected animals, as seen by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""
* This directly links the crystals (melamine and cyanuric acid) detected by FTIR to the animals that were *affected* (sickened).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịrụ ọrụ akụrụ (Kidney failure):**  The passage states the chemicals *can cause* kidney failure, but FTIR doesn't show kidney failure directly – it shows the presence of the harmful crystals.
* **B: crystallization nke mmamịrị anụ ụlọ (Crystallization of animal feed):** FTIR shows the crystals *in* the feed, not the crystallization process itself.
* **D: Nri anụ ụlọ na-adịghị mma (Spoiled animal feed):** While the feed *was* harmful, FTIR specifically identifies the *composition* of the harmful substance, not just that it's spoiled.



"
"""E ji nkebi ahịrịokwu ahụ """"Queen of Extreme"""" kọwaa Luna?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tọmi Drima sị na """"Luna bụ Eze nwaanyị ihe ngabiga oke nke mbụ."""" (Tommy Dreamer said, """"Luna was the first Queen of Extreme."""").

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who described Luna as ""Queen of Extreme""."
"""Ònye kọwara Luna dị ka onye """"na-akpa ike""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tọmi Drima sị na """"Luna bụ Eze nwaanyị ihe ngabiga oke nke mbụ. Onye nlekwa ọrụ m nke mbụ. Luna nwụrụ n'abalị ọnwa abụọ. Ọ pụrụ iche dị ka ya. **Nwaanyị siri ike.**"""" 

Tommy Dreamer (Tọmi Drima) is the one who described Luna as ""strong"" (""nwaanyị siri ike""). While Dustin Runnels expressed affection, he didn't use that specific descriptor.



"
Gịnị kwesịrị ime onye ọkwọ ụgbọala ihe mberede mere?,"The correct answer is **A: E merụrụ ya n'isi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""onye ọkwọ ụgbọ merụrụ ezigbo ahụ n'isi"" (the driver was injured in the head).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage says no one *in the house* was injured, it doesn't say anything about them being injured by the driver's accident.
* **C:** The driver was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth *then* transferred to Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, so this is the wrong order.
* **D:** While emergency services *did* help him out of the car, the question asks what *happened to* the driver, not what others did *for* him.



"
Omume ndị otu South Africa mere n'oge asọmpi rugby enweghị ntụpọ n'ụzọ ọ bụla?,"The correct answer is **B: Ike ijikwa bọọlụ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""...ụzọ nhàzi pụrụ iche mere ha ka ha pụọ iche..."" which translates to ""...their unique way of handling the ball made them stand out..."". This directly refers to their ball-handling skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mmekọ ọnụ mara mma (Good teamwork):** While teamwork is implied, the passage doesn't *specifically* highlight it as a key performance factor.
*   **C: Onye ọkachamara na-egosi na mmalite nke asọmpi ahụ (Professionalism shown at the start of the competition):** The passage mentions a strong start (26-0 victory), but doesn’t necessarily emphasize professionalism.
*   **D: Ikike ịgbachitere (Defensive ability):** The passage mentions their tackling and defense ""...Ụzọ mkpachapụ anya ha n’ime mgbochi..."", but ball handling is more prominently described as what set them apart.



"
"Kedu ihe egwuregwu South Africa malitere ịka mma, dịka akụkụ nke ya si dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ka egwuregwu na-aga n'ihu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndi kachasị elu na asọmpi bu South Africa bidoro na akara nke oma...Ndị mba Sawụt Afrịka melitere nwayọ nwayọ ka ịsọ mpi gara n'ihu."" This directly translates to ""South Africa started well...The South African team gradually improved as the competition progressed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihe dịka elekere 10:00 nke ụtụtụ** - This is the *time* the games started, not when South Africa started playing well.
*   **B: Mgbe iwusi ike nchebe** - While their defense was good, the passage says they *improved* as the game went on, not that their defense was the initial reason for their success.
*   **C: Ka e meriri Zambia** - They started well *with* the win against Zambia, but the passage focuses on their gradual improvement *after* the initial start.



"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara akụ na ụba China na-akwadoghị site na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Germany na-ebupụ ụgbọ ala karịa China mgbe niile**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that China *surpassed* Germany in automobile exports last year. This directly contradicts the claim that Germany consistently exports more cars than China.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

*   **A: Kemgbe emejuputa mgbanwe mgbanwe, aku na uba China abawanyela nke ukwuu:** The passage explicitly states China's economy has grown thirteenfold since reforms began.
*   **B: E jiri ya tụnyere United States, China nwere nnukwu ahịa mbupụ maka ụgbọ ala:** The passage confirms China surpassed the US as the largest market for automobiles.
*   **C: GDP China nwere ike karịa nke United States n'ọdịnihu:** The passage states that China's GDP could surpass that of the US within the next two decades.



"
"Kedu mgbe GDP China nwere ike gafere nke United States, ka akụkụ ahụ kwuru?","The correct answer is **B: Afọ iri abụọ site ugbu a**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aku na Uba mba China nwere ike idi ukwu karia nke mba United State na agbata ogu-afo abuo"" which translates to ""China's GDP could surpass that of the United States in about twenty years.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ọtụtụ mgbanwe akụ na ụba** (many changes in wealth and GDP) - This is a general statement, not a specific timeframe.
*   **C: Mgbe ọchịchị ọhụrụ malitere** (When a new government begins) - The passage doesn't link the GDP surpassing to a change in government.
*   **D: Iri afọ atọ site ugbu a** (Thirty years from now) - The passage specifically mentions ""agbata ogu-afo abuo"" (twenty years).



"
Gịnị bụ ndụmọdụ Hu maka mba ndị ka na-emepe emepe?,"The correct answer is **D: Na-ezere imetọ ụzọ ochie**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hu cautioned developing nations ""ka ha ghara itinye aka n'usoro omume mgbe ochie bụ ibu ụzọ metọọ were kpochawa ma emechaa."" This translates to ""to avoid following the old practice of polluting first and cleaning up later."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nabata ibu ọrụ ndị na-eme ka ha nwee ọganihu:** While implied, it's not the direct advice given.
* **B: Tụlee mmepụta akụ na ụba:** This is about China's own approach, not advice to other countries.
* **C: Na-aga n'ihu na karịa ọrụ ha dị ugbu a:** This is the opposite of what Hu advised. He wants them to avoid past mistakes.



"
Gịnị ka Hu hapụrụ ikwu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ego nke mbelata nke ikuku carbon**.

The passage states: ""O kwughi oke a ga-akwụ, kama ọ sị na a ga-ele anya na nrụpụta akụ na ụba China wee kwụọ ụgwọ."" This directly translates to ""He did not say the amount to be paid, but said that China's output and wealth would be looked at and charged.""  Therefore, he *did not mention* the cost of the carbon reduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihe kpatara mbelata (The reason for the reduction):** The passage mentions the *goal* of reduction but not the reasons behind it.
*   **B: Ndụmọdụ maka mba ndị na-apụta maka mmetọ (Advice to countries emitting pollution):** He did offer advice, warning them against ""first pollute and then clean up"" and to not ""let their emissions exceed their capacity"".
*   **C: Ụbọchị ezubere iche maka mbelata ikuku carbon (Date set for carbon reduction):** The passage mentions a target ""by 2020, from 2005 levels"" - so the date *is* mentioned."
"N'okwu Veerman, ònye n'ime ihe ndị a kọwara ọnọdụ ahụ nke ọma?","The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

Richard Veerman specifically states, “Angola is heading towards its worst outbreak ever and the situation is worsening within Angola.” He is directly describing the situation *in* Angola.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọgwụ na-enweghị oke (Unrestricted medicine)** - This isn't mentioned in the quote.
*   **C: Mangola** - Mangola is the name of the health aid organization, not what he describes.
*   **D: Wọld Helt Ọganaịzeshọn (World Health Organization)** - While the WHO is mentioned as being in agreement, Veerman's quote focuses on Angola itself.



"
Kedu onye ga-ejupụta oche nke Huhne ugbu a ka ndị ikpe amalitela?,"The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne agbaala arukwaghi ma onye ga anochi ya na otu ndi oso-eze achi bu Ed Davey MP."" This translates to ""Huhne has resigned and the person who will replace him in the leadership team is Ed Davey MP."" Therefore, Ed Davey will fill Huhne's position."
"Mgbe ikpe ahụ gasịrị, onye ga-eweghara ọrụ dị ka Minista Azụmahịa?","The correct answer is **C: Davey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Huhne has resigned and the man to replace him as the Liberal Democrat candidate is Ed Davey MP."" This clearly indicates that Ed Davey will be taking over Huhne's role, which includes being the Minister of Business.



"
Kedu ihe ndị na-eme ihe nkiri na-agba ndị na-ege ntị ume ka ha mee mgbe ha na-ege opera nke Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **D: Kwe ka ihe ha hụrụ n'anya na-achị ndụ ha.**

Here's why:

The passage states the opera is about an artist ""whose love for Japan and passion ruled his life.""  The artists performing are then encouraging the audience to embrace that same idea - to let their passions ""rule their lives.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jiri wii wii** - This is unrelated to the passage.
* **B: Gaa na Japan** - While the opera is *about* Japan, the artists are not telling the audience to travel there.
* **C: Bịa soro ha mee ihe na ogbo** - The passage mentions artists painting *at* the exhibit, not inviting the audience to join them on stage.



"
"N'oge opera, onye na-afụ ọnụ nkwonkwo ugboro ugboro?","The correct answer is **C: Ndị na-ese ihe**.

Here's why:

The passage states the opera is *about* an artist whose love for Japan and medicine dominated their life. The passage also mentions artists painting at the exhibition, and gallery owners encouraging spectators to join them. This strongly implies the focus of the opera and associated exhibition is the artists themselves. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: onye edemede (the writer):** While Saint-Saens wrote the opera, the opera isn't *about* the writer.
*   **B: Ndị na-ekiri na-asụ French (French-speaking audience):** The audience doesn't form a central theme of the opera as described.
*   **D: Saint-Saens, Camille:** The opera is *by* Saint-Saens, not about him.



"
Kedu okwu ọzọ ị ga-eji kọwaa ''spacewalk'' Leonov?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọsọ Oghere**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Leonov performed the first ""njem n'eluigwe"" (spacewalk), which is described as being alone outside the spacecraft for twelve minutes. This is an example of space exploration and a feat in the ""ọsọ gbasara oghere mpụga uwa"" (space race).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njem Apollo-Soyuz:** This refers to a joint mission he later led, not the spacewalk itself.
*   **C: ọrụ ụgbọ ala inyeaka:** This doesn’t relate to space travel.
*   **D: Onye na-ahụ maka oghere nke 11:** This is a nickname but doesn’t describe what a spacewalk *is*.



"
Kedu ozi Leonov duziri maka Soviet Union?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Ka afọ iri gachara, o duuru ngalaba Sọviet nke ozi Apolo Soyuz nke gosiri na ọsọ gbasara oghere mpụga uwa eruola na njedebe."" This directly indicates Leonov led the Soviet side of the Apollo-Soyuz mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asọmpi oghere** - While his achievements were part of the space race, he didn't lead a general ""space competition.""
*   **C: Onye na-ahụ maka oghere nke 11** - The passage refers to him as ""ọganambaraigwe nke 11"" (""cosmonaut number 11""), but this is a description, not a mission he led.
*   **D: EVA** - He *performed* the first EVA (spacewalk), but he didn't *lead* an EVA mission as a broad endeavor. He led the Apollo-Soyuz mission.



"
Kedu onye merụrụ ahụ n'ihe mberede ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Mgbe ihe mberde ahụ mechara, e buru Gibson gawa n’ụlọ ọgwụ mana ọ nwụrụ mgbe obere oge gachara."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.) This clearly indicates Gibson was the one injured in the accident.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Onye ọrụ ụgbọala (The driver):** The text says the 64-year-old driver was *not* injured.
*   **C: Ụmụaka (Children):** The children were scared but the text says they ""gbaachitere azụ"" (stepped back) meaning they weren't hit.
*   **D: ọkwọ ụgbọ ala (The driver):** Again, the text states the driver wasn't injured.



"
Gịnị mere ndị kpatara ihe mberede ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Otu nwụrụ ma onye nke ọzọ emerụghị ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   The text states Gibson died after being taken to the hospital.
*   The text also explicitly states the truck driver, who was 64 years old, was *not* injured in the crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye ọ bụla nwụrụ** - This is incorrect because the truck driver did not die.
*   **C: Ha nọ na-akwa ákwá ma na-akwa ákwá** - This refers to the children who witnessed the crash, not the people *involved* in the crash.
*   **D: Ha abụọ merụrụ ahụ** - This is incorrect because the driver was not injured and Gibson died.



"
Kedu n'ime mmetụta ndị a ka ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị na-arụ ọrụ na mmemme ahụ nwere olileanya ịhụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị agha ebili mmiri**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically compares the Milky Way's influence on the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy to the moon's influence on Earth, causing tides. It states, ""Dị ka ọnwa na etinye ndọta n’ụwa, na-akpata elili mmiri, etu ahụ ka Milky Way ahụ si etinye ike na galazi Sagittarius ahụ."" This clearly indicates that scientists are hoping to observe tidal forces (ebili mmiri) as a result of the interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ahụkarị isiokwu** - The passage doesn't mention any expected regular patterns.
*   **C: Obere irighiri ihe** - While the halo is made of smaller structures, the passage focuses on the overall tidal interaction, not individual small disturbances.
*   **D: Isi ihe dị nchara** - The passage does not discuss anything about hard cores."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ndị nchọpụta na-amụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Milky Way and Sagittarius galaxy**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the interaction between the Milky Way galaxy and the Sagittarius galaxy. It compares this interaction to the moon's influence on Earth's tides, emphasizing the gravitational pull between these two galaxies.  The entire text revolves around studying the effects of the Milky Way on Sagittarius.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọnwa na Milky Way (Moon and Milky Way)** - The moon is only used as an analogy, it's not the primary subject of study.
*   **B: Sagittarius galaxy na mbara ala ụwa (Sagittarius galaxy and Earth's land)** - Earth is not discussed in the passage.
*   **C: Ọnwa na Ụwa (Moon and Earth)** - This is the example used for comparison but not what the scientists are researching.



"
Kedu ihe na-adịghị n'okpuru nkatọ site na conservatives na ìhè nke Itie?,"The correct answer is **C: Kedu onye na-enweta nkwekọrịta maka mwughachi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controversy revolves around *how* the funds were distributed after Hurricane Katrina, with some believing it was deliberately done in a biased way (""The Bush New Orleans Compact""). This directly relates to **who benefitted from the reconstruction contracts** – which is what option C asks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmefu maka ebumnuche mmadụ (Spending for human purposes):** The passage doesn't indicate conservatives were criticizing spending on people. The issue is *who* received the money.
*   **B: Mmgbalị ezughị ezu iji wughachi (Insufficient effort to rebuild):** While reconstruction efforts were likely criticized, the passage focuses on accusations of bias in the awarding of contracts, not a lack of effort overall.
*   **D: Na-emefu na nrụzi (Spending and repairs):** This is too broad. The argument is not simply that money was spent and repairs made, but that the process was skewed.



"
Kedu onye na-emegide nkwekọrịta mwughachi maka mbọ enyemaka Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị ọkachamara na Washington**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nnyocha nke mgbalị nrụgharị chere ihu na-enye ndị e chere na ha bụ ndị si Wọshịntịn ọrụ nrụgharị."" This directly implies that people in Washington were critical of, or opposing, the reconstruction efforts and how funds were allocated after Hurricane Katrina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ndị nchekwa akụ na ụba** - The passage does not mention these groups.
*   **B: Ndị nnwere onwe** - The passage does not mention this group.
*   **C: Osisi** - This is unrelated to the passage.



"
"Ebee ka a ga-ahụ ọkụ si n'ụgbọelu Stardust na mbụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **B: North California**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It was anticipated to put on a show of light for friends in **northern California**, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah."" 

While the capsule will *travel* through Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho, the initial sighting of the light show is expected to be in northern California.



"
"A na-akọ na ụgbọ elu ahụ ga-agbaji n'ime ndekọ ndị a, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Na-enye ìhè kachasị mbara igwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states the capsule is expected to ""eme otu ihe ngosi ọkụ maka ndị enyi anyị..."" (create a light show for our friends...) and that the craft ""ga eyi kpakpando na-agbafe n'ihu igwe"" (will appear as a brilliant streak across the sky). This directly relates to providing a prominent light display.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inwe ọnụnọ kacha ukwuu na obodo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the capsule's presence in cities.
*   **C: ụzọ kacha ọsọ azụ n'ụwa** - While the capsule *is* returning to Earth, the passage doesn't focus on it being the fastest return. It compares the re-entry to Apollo X.
*   **D: Ụzọ kachasị ọsọ si San Francisco gaa Los Angeles** - This is a comparison used to illustrate speed but isn’t what the capsule will *do*.



"
Mmekọrịta dị n'etiti Saroja Balasubramanian na Dr. Malar Balasubramanian amabeghị?,"The correct answer is **C: Nne**.

The text states: ""Achọtara ozu Saroja Balasubramanian, onye dị afọ iri ise na atọ...ka ahuchara nne ya na azu ugbo-ala na-onwu."" This translates to ""The body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old...was found after her mother was murdered in a farm backyard.""  Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian was the mother of Dr. Malar Balasubramanian.



"
Ebee ka achọtara ozu Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: N'akụkụ okporo ụzọ** (Beside the highway).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Achọtara ozu Saroja Balasubramanian, ebe ahụ, ja akwa mkpuchi kpudoro ya."" and ""Ọ dụrụ ndị ọrụ nche gaa na Oldsmobile Intrigue ojii ya nke nọ n’ụzọukwu narị ise n’itoanya."" This means the body was found near the highway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kpọmkwem na Cincinnati** - While Blue Ash (where the doctor was found) is near Cincinnati, the body wasn't found *in* Cincinnati specifically.
*   **C: N'ime akpati ụgbọ ala** - The body was found *near* the car, but not *inside* it.
*   **D: N'ime Pittsburgh** - The events started in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio, near Cincinnati.



"
Kedu ihe eBay zụtara?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ụlọọrụ ahụ nwere olileanya ịgbasa ụmụ isi mmalite uru ya ma mee ka amara ya amara n’ebe Skype nwere ọkwa guzosịrị ike..."" This indicates eBay acquired Skype to expand into markets where Skype was already strong.



"
Kedu ihe eBay chọrọ imezu site na ịzụta?,"The correct answer is **B: Mee ka mpaghara ala gị gbasaa (Expand its geographical reach)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the company (eBay) hopes to ""expand its footprint"" into areas where Skype already has a strong presence, specifically mentioning China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.  This directly translates to expanding its geographical reach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chịkọta ego ya (Increase its revenue):** While expansion *could* lead to increased revenue, the passage doesn’t focus on that as the primary goal.
*   **C: Mee ka ọ pụta ìhè (Improve its image):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about improving eBay's image.
*   **D: Ime ihe ga-atọ ndị nwe ya ụtọ (Do something to please its owners):** This is too vague and not supported by the text.



"
"Ònye, dị ka Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo, na-ezere iso ndị mkpọrọ fọdụrụ n'ogige ahụ mgbe agha ahụ gasịrị na-akpakọrịta?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị na-akparịta ụka (The negotiators)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Ndị mkparịta ụka nwara ịweta udo, mana ihe ndị mkpọrọ chọrọ edoghi anya."" This means the negotiators were trying to communicate with the prisoners who refused to go back inside.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị otu nnapụta maka ndị ọrụ mgbanyụ ọkụ (The rescue team for firefighters)** - The passage mentions a fire suppression team, but doesn't mention a rescue team *for* them.
*   **C: Ndị isi (The leaders)** - The passage doesn't mention any leaders attempting to engage the prisoners.
*   **D: Ndị ọrụ ahụike (Medical personnel)** - Medical personnel treated the injured, but didn’t attempt to negotiate.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a mere ka ndị a mara ikpe gbasasịa na ọgba aghara ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọkụ** (Fire).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""N'etiti 10:00 na 11:00 MDT n'abalị, ndị mkpọrọ nọ na mpụta mụnyere ọkụ."" (Between 10:00 and 11:00 MDT at night, the prisoners on the yard lit a fire.) This directly initiated the escalation and the response from the authorities, leading to the riot being broken up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inwe mkparịta ụka na-amị mkpụrụ** (Fruitless negotiations): While negotiations were attempted, they didn't *cause* the riot to be broken up. They failed to resolve the situation.
*   **B: Gas na-egbu egbu** (Gas): The gas was used to *suppress* the riot, not cause it.
*   **C: Ndị mkpọrọ ndị ọzọ merụrụ ahụ** (Other injured prisoners): Injured prisoners were a consequence of the riot, not the reason it was broken up.

"Kedu ihe Iran kwesịrị iwepụ onwe ya, ka Ayatollah Ali Khamenei siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: ịdabere na mmanụ**.

The passage states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described reliance on oil as """"a curse"""" that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution and was something the country needed to wean itself off of."" 

This directly translates to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei believing Iran needs to free itself from its dependence on oil."
"Ònye kwetara mmetụta nke mmachi na Iranian aku na uba, dị ka e kwuru na akụkụ?","The correct answer is **C: Ali Khamenei, Ayatollah**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Onye isi kacha ndị isi obodo nke obodo ahụ, onye aha ya bụ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, kọwatara ndabere na mmanụ dị ka """"ọnya"""" nke bidoro tupu mgbanwe okpukpe Islam n'obodo Aịraanụ n'afọ 1979 ma bụrụkwa ihe obodo kwesịrị isi na ya napụta onwe ya."" This indicates he acknowledged the importance of oil and, implicitly, the impact of sanctions on it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ochie isi mmalite** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: OPEC** - OPEC is mentioned in relation to declining oil shipments, but not as having agreed to the impact of sanctions.
*   **D: Njikọ nke European States** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị eme n'oge usoro ntuli aka French?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị nnọchite anya ntuli aka na-agụ vootu** (Representatives of the vote do not read the votes).

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Ndị ọrụ efu ga agụkọ ụtụ nile na oke nlegideanya , ma site n'usoro atọrọ atọ"" (neutral staff will read all the votes in complete transparency, following a set procedure). This means only neutral staff read the votes, not representatives of the candidates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Igwe ịtụ vootu a na-ahụ anya** (Visible voting machines) - The passage doesn't mention anything about voting machines. It describes a paper ballot system.
*   **B: Ndị nnọchiteanya ezigara ndị na-aga ime** (Representatives sent to go) - The passage specifically states ""Ndị a na atụrụ ụtụ nwere ike iziga ndị nnọchiteanya ka ha gbaa ama ihe nile mere"" (Those who are voted for can send representatives to witness everything that happens).
*   **C: Mbinye aka n'akwụkwọ ịtụ vootu** (Signing the ballot) - The passage describes a process where voters put their ballot in an envelope, and there's a focus on ensuring the envelopes aren't tampered with, implying the ballots aren't signed.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* part of the French voting process, as described in the text, is representatives reading the votes."
Ebee ka ndị ntuli aka na-etinye mmasị n'ọsọ ha?,"The correct answer is **B: Na mpempe akwụkwọ ebipụtalarị**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""onye na-atụ ụtụ etinye akwụkwọ ụtụ ya amachiri amachi n'ime igbe nnakọ ụtụ ma bie aka n'akwụkwọ ndị tụrụ ụtụ."" This translates to ""the voter places their ballot in a sealed envelope and puts it in the ballot box and signs the ballots."" The ballots are the ""akwụkwọ ebipụtalarị"" (pre-printed papers).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na akwụkwọ mpịakọta** (In a register) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: N'isi akwụkwọ ozi** (On the letterhead) - This doesn't relate to the voting process described.
*   **D: Na ngwaọrụ n'ime ụlọ ntu** (On a device in the polling station) - While the polling station is mentioned, the ballots aren't placed on a device.



"
Kedu ihe kpaliri Allen ịmalite ichu nta ya afọ asatọ maka Musashi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ego ya na nyocha oke osimiri**

Here's why:

*   The passage states Allen ""etinyela nnukwu oke aku n’uba ya n’ime oru nchoputa ihe no na mmiri iji bido icho Musashi"" - meaning he invested a lot of money in ocean research to find the Musashi.
*   It also mentions the search was driven by ""nnukwu aguu onwere gbasara agha"" (significant historical interest related to the war) but the initial motivation and means was financially driven research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihe ịga nke ọma ego ya** - While Allen is rich, the passage doesn't say his *success* with money directly caused the search. It was the *use* of his money.
*   **B: N'ịtụle eserese nke oke osimiri** - The passage mentions mapping the seabed, but this was *part of* the search process, not the initial reason for it.
*   **D: Ịnụ ọkụ n'obi ya maka esemokwu ahụ** - While he was interested in the historical significance, the text prioritizes the financial investment in the research.



"
"Kedu ihe Allen mefuru nnukwu ego ya, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Nnyocha nke oké osimiri** (Ocean exploration).

Here's why:

The passage states Allen ""etinyela nnukwu oke aku n’uba ya n’ime oru nchoputa ihe no na mmiri"" (invested a large fortune in his efforts to search the sea). This investment was specifically to find the Musashi, meaning he spent his money on the **ocean exploration** itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-eweghachi Musashi azụ** (Recovering the Musashi) - While this is the *goal* of the exploration, it's not what he spent the money *on*.
*   **C: Na-arụ ọrụ ROV** (Operating the ROV) - The ROV is a *tool* used in the exploration, not the exploration itself.
*   **D: Na-amụ maapụ nke oke osimiri** (Mapping the ocean floor) - Mapping is a *part* of the exploration process, but again, not the overall expenditure.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo, o yikarịrị ka ọ kpatara ọnọdụ dị ize ndụ n'ime na n'èzí osisi ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Atọmịk ike** (Nuclear power).

Here's why:

The passage states the situation stemmed from a ""nuclear facility"" and mentions the detection of radioactive cesium and iodine. It *suggests* a possible meltdown, indicating a problem with the nuclear process itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Radieshon sitere na ceium** (Cesium radiation) - While cesium radiation is *present*, it's a *result* of the problem, not the *cause*.
*   **C: Anwụrụ ọkụ** (Fire) - The passage mentions ""white smoke,"" but the core issue is the radiation, not a general fire.
*   **D: Iodine** (Iodine) - Similar to cesium, iodine is a radioactive substance detected, but not the underlying cause.

Therefore, the fundamental cause of the dangerous situation, according to the text, is related to the **nuclear power** facility and a potential meltdown.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị otu n'ime ndụmọdụ nchekwa enyere ndị obodo n'ihi ihe mere osisi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Zere iku ume na anwụrụ ọkụ**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""ka ha nọrọ n'ime ụlọ, gbanyụọ ntụ oyi ma ghara iṅụ mmiri na-agba n'ụlọ."" This translates to: ""to stay inside, turn off air conditioning, and do not drink tap water.""
*   **Option A (Zere iji ikuku ntụ oyi - Avoid using air conditioning)** is a direct instruction from the passage.
*   **Option B (Nọrọ n'ime ụlọ - Stay inside)** is a direct instruction from the passage.
*   **Option D (Zere ịṅụ mmiri pọmpụ - Avoid drinking tap water)** is a direct instruction from the passage.
*   **Option C (Zere iku ume na anwụrụ ọkụ - Avoid breathing the smoke)** is **not** mentioned in the text. While it's generally good advice during a fire or industrial accident, it wasn't specifically advised to the citizens in this scenario.



"
"Kedu ihe kacha enye nsogbu gbasara XDR-TB, n'echiche Dr. Moll?","The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ọnwụ ya dị elu**.

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Dr. Moll as saying XDR-TB poses ""a great concern and a danger because of the high mortality rate associated with it."" This clearly indicates that the high death rate is his primary concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ahụhụ ụlọ ọgwụ na-agwọ ugbu a:** While the passage mentions hospital transmission, it's a *result* of the problem, not the core concern.
*   **B: Iguzogide ọgwụ dị iche iche:** The passage states it's drug-resistant, but Dr. Moll’s direct quote focuses on the high mortality rate.
*   **C: Mmadụ ole onye butere ọrịa nwere ike ibunye ya:** This is a detail about how the disease spreads, not the biggest concern.



"
Ole ndị ekwenyesiri ike na ụdị mgbanwe ọhụrụ a n'etiti ndị ọrịa bụ ndị ọkachamara ahụike?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""Dr. Moll cheere, ma ihe dị ka abụọ bụ ndị ọrụ ụlọ ọgwụ."" This directly indicates that approximately two healthcare workers were among those infected with the new strain.
"
Kedu teknụzụ nke usoro NextGen na-arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknụzụ na-eji satellites**.

The passage explicitly states: ""O ji teknụzụ satilaịti dị iche na teknụzụ rada nọ n'ala were enyere ndị na-ejikwa nfegharị ụgbọelu aka..."" (It uses satellite technology different from ground radar to help air traffic controllers...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nkà na ụzụ na-atụ anya izi ezi:** While NextGen *provides* more accurate information, it doesn’t *operate* on predictive technology as its core.
*   **C: Teknụzụ radar nke ala:** The passage specifically contrasts NextGen with ground radar.
*   **D: Usoro maka ibelata carbon umu anwuru:** This is a *result* of NextGen, not the technology it *uses*.



"
Kedu uru bụ uru NextGen maka ndị na-ahụ maka ụgbọ elu?,"The correct answer is **D: Obere mmanụ ụgbọala ojiji** (Reduced fuel consumption).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that NextGen will ""save millions of gallons of fuel each year.""  This directly relates to reduced fuel usage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ụgbọ elu dị obere kilomita ole na ole** (Shorter flight distances) - The passage doesn't mention shorter distances, it focuses on more efficient routes.
*   **B: Ntinye ụgbọ elu ka mma** (Better aircraft landing) - While NextGen *can* contribute to better landings, the passage doesn't highlight that as a primary benefit.
*   **C: Obere ikuku carbon** (Lower carbon emissions) - Lower fuel consumption *leads* to lower carbon emissions, but the passage directly states fuel savings, making 'D' the more direct and accurate answer.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the FBI agents were accused of ""focusing on simplistic cases, particularly traffic stops, with the aim of inflating their statistics."" This directly translates to focusing resources on cases that were easily solvable to boost their performance numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-abawanye ohere nke ịga nke ọma** – While the agents *intended* to increase their success rate, the passage focuses on *how* they did it, not just the goal.
*   **C: Imesi ike siri ike na ihe omume nke ikiri ndị gba ọtọ** – The passage doesn’t mention a focus on surveillance or aggressive tactics beyond the traffic stops.
*   **D: Ikpe ụgbọala na-apụ n'anya** – The passage specifically mentions traffic stops, but doesn't say that the cases were dismissed or flawed after being brought to court.



"
Gịnị bụ ọrụ FBI n'okpuru atụmatụ rụrụ arụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Wepụta mmejọ ndị kwesịrị ịdị mfe idozi ụzọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI was accused of fabricating evidence in easy-to-solve cases (like traffic accidents) and that Congress mandated the FBI release agents for cases that were ""easily resolvable"" to boost statistics. This directly corresponds to resolving easy cases or flaws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyekwuo ihe gbasara ụgbọ ala ezuru anya** – While traffic accidents were *used* in the scheme, the FBI's role wasn't simply to report on them. It was to manipulate them.
*   **B: Na-ebuli ọnụego ihe ịga nke ọma nke ụlọ ọrụ ahụ** – This is the *motivation* behind the actions, not the action itself.
*   **D: Ndị ọrụ na-ahụ maka ikpe metụtara porn** - The passage does not mention pornography.



"
Kedu ihe mere gwongworo ọkụ a kpọrọ n'ihe mberede JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ọ gbawara** (It exploded).

The passage states: ""...ma gbawaa, nke mere ka a kagbuo njem ofufe niile..."" which translates to ""...and exploded, causing all flights to be cancelled..."".

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ dara** (It crashed) - While an explosion *can* lead to a crash, the passage specifically states it *exploded* first.
*   **B: Ọ tụgharịrị** (It turned over) - The passage mentions the fire trucks turning over *under* the plane, not the plane itself turning over.
*   **D: Mgbapụta gas mere** (Gas leak caused it) - The passage doesn't mention a gas leak.



"
Kedu ihe amachibidoro n'ọdụ ụgbọ elu n'ihi ihe mberede JAS 39C Gripen?,"The correct answer is **A: ọrụ ụgbọ elu** (flight operations).

The text states the crash caused ""all flight operations to be suspended at the airport."" This directly answers the question of what was prohibited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngwa ọkụ** (Fire trucks) - While fire trucks *responded* to the incident, they weren't *prohibited*.
* **C: Mpaghara pịa** (Press area) - The text mentions media reporting, but doesn't say a press area was restricted.
* **D: Ndị isi otu** (Squad leaders) - The pilot's rank is mentioned, but not any restriction on squad leaders.



"
Ònye natara ndụmọdụ n'aka Brzezinski n'oge Mgbanwe nke Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor to Carter and helped him manage events like the Iranian Revolution (which led to the Iran hostage crisis). This means Carter received advice from Brzezinski during that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kissinger:** Brzezinski *replaced* Kissinger as NSA.
*   **B: Kennedy:** Brzezinski advised Kennedy in the 1960s, but the question specifically asks about the Iranian Revolution, which happened much later.
*   **D: Johnson:** Brzezinski advised Johnson in the 1960s, also before the Iranian Revolution.



"
"Ruo 1977, ònye jere ozi dị ka onye ndụmọdụ nchekwa obodo?","The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""Dịka NSA, o nyere Carter aka n’ijikwa ihe omume mbaụwa n’ụzọ kwesiri ekwesi... na nnọchi Henry Kissinger."" This means Brzezinski *replaced* Kissinger as National Security Advisor. Therefore, Kissinger held the position before 1977."

Here's why:

The passage states Bobek scored *468 goals* during his time with Partizan Belgrade, not *more than* 468.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Ọ bụ ya bụ onye gbara ọtụtụ goolu:** The passage explicitly states ""O nwebeghị onye ọzọ ọbụla na-agbakarịala bọọlụ maọbụ nyekarịa goolụ n'otu egwuregwu bọọlụ ahụ karịa Bobek.""
*   **C: A họpụtara ya otu oge ka ọ bụrụ onye ọkaibe n'otu egwuregwu:** The passage says in 1995 he was named the best player in Partizan history.
*   **D: Ọ bụ onye ọkpụkpọ kacha pụta ìhè n'otu egwuregwu:** This is a reasonable interpretation of being named the best player in the club's history.



"
Kedu nke bụ eziokwu gbasara ihe mere Bobek na Partizan Belgrade gara aga?,"The correct answer is **A: Na 1945, ọ bịanyere aka na-egwu Partizan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""O sonyere ha na 1945 ma nọrọ ruo 1958."" (He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While he was born in Zagreb, the text doesn't state he *played* for a Zagreb team before Partizan.
*   **C:** He played until 1958, not 1995. 1995 is the year he was honored.
*   **D:** While true he *became* the greatest player, the question asks about his *past* with Partizan. The fact he was honored in 1995 is a result of his past accomplishments, not a past event itself.



"
"Kedu ihe dị iche na Hesperonychus na Velociraptor, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Ụkwụ nke abụọ ka ibu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mkpisiri aka ya nke abuo buru ibu karia, nke tuputara aha ahu bu Hesperonychus nke putara “nkpisiri odida-anyanwu”."" This translates to ""Its second claw was larger, which is where the name Hesperonychus, meaning ""western claw,"" comes from.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inwe ụkwụ abụọ** - The passage states both Hesperonychus *and* Velociraptor walked on two legs.
*   **C: Ahụ ya dum kpuchiri nku** - While the passage says it was a feathered animal, it doesn't state if its *entire* body was covered.
*   **D: Ọbara dị ọkụ** - The passage doesn't mention anything about being warm-blooded.



"
"""Kedu akụkụ nke ụdị 'morphological etemeete bụ isi iyi nke aha """"Hesperonychus""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Ụkwụ ya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Mkpisiri aka ya nke abuo buru ibu karia, nke tuputara aha ahu bu Hesperonychus nke putara “nkpisiri odida-anyanwu”."" This directly translates to ""...Its second claw was large, which is the origin of the name Hesperonychus, meaning 'claw of the west'.""  Therefore, the claw (part of the foot) is the morphological feature that inspired the name."
Kedu nke ziri ezi n'ime okwu ndị na-esote banyere agbapụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Na Buffalo, e nwere égbè**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Di ya dị afọ iri atọ, onye a mụrụ na Buffalo, bụ otu on’ime mmadụ anọ e gburu n’egbe ahụ a gbara..."" (His thirty-year-old wife, born in Buffalo, was one of four people killed in the shooting.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ma di ma nwunye si Texas:** The text says they *moved* to Buffalo *from* Texas, not that they are both from Texas.
* **B: Mmadụ ise merụrụ ahụ:** The passage explicitly states four people were *killed*, and that the wife was *not* injured. It doesn't mention how many were injured.
* **C: Agbamakwụkwọ a mere na Buffalo otu afọ gara aga:** The passage states the *wedding* happened a year ago, not the shooting. The shooting is referred to as “egbe a gbara” – the shooting that occurred.



"
Kedu nke bụ eziokwu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara ememme ahụ bụ ebe a gbara egbe ahụ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ememe ncheta Buffalo bụ ebe o mere**.

Here's why:

The passage states the couple *came to Buffalo* to celebrate with friends and family. It also states the husband was one of the four people killed *in the shooting* which happened in Buffalo. Therefore, Buffalo is the location of both the celebration and the shooting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O mere na mmemme ncheta nke nnọnụụdị** - The passage doesn't mention the type of memorial event.
*   **C: O mere na ememe na Texas** - The couple *moved from* Texas to Buffalo for the celebration. The event didn't happen in Texas.
*   **D: O mere n'agbamakwụkwọ di na nwunye ahụ** - The shooting happened separate from the wedding. It doesn't say it happened *at* the wedding.



"
"Kedu ihe bụ nchegbu gọọmentị mbụ gbasara Luno, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Mgbapu mmanụ (Oil spill)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""The Luno nwere kubik mita 120-160 nke mmanụ n'ime ya mgbe o mebiri..."" which translates to ""The Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of oil inside it when it broke..."". This immediately establishes the potential for an oil spill as a primary concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ụkọ mbupu maka fatịlaịza (Cargo shipment for fertilizer)** - While mentioned, this is a later concern after the initial damage.
*   **B: Zara na ifufe siri ike (Damage from strong winds)** - The strong winds and waves *caused* the damage, but weren't the initial *concern* after the incident.
*   **D: Enwere ike imerụ ndị otu ụgbọ mmiri ahụ (Potential for injury to the crew)** - While the crew was injured (a sprained ankle), the text highlights the potential *environmental* disaster of the oil spill as the primary initial worry.



"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara ọdịda Luno bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dabere n'akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: N'oge mmebi ahụ, ụgbọ mmiri ahụ nwere mmanụ ụgbọala 100 mita.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""The Luno nwere kubik mita 120-160 nke mmanụ n'ime ya..."" (The Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of oil inside it...) This directly contradicts option B, which states 100 meters.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Arụmọrụ ahụ mere tupu ibunye ibu ahụ:** The passage says the ship was *about* to carry fertilizer but workers were afraid to load it, implying the incident happened *before* the load was fully onboard.
* **C: Otu onye ọrụ n'ime mmadụ iri na abụọ ahụ nwere mmerụ ahụ:** The passage states ""mmerụ ahụ enwere bụ mgbawa imi."" (The injury sustained was a sprained ankle) implying at least one person was injured.
* **D: A manyere ụgbọ ahụ ka ọ ghara imebi mmiri:** The passage mentions ""oke ifufe na ebili mmiri dubara ya n'ime brekwọta ahụ."" (Strong winds and high tides pushed it into the breakwater) which indicates the ship was forced against the breakwater to avoid further sinking.



"
Kedu mgbe Algeria nwetara nnwere onwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Afọ 1960**.

The passage states: ""Na oge 1960 olaghachiri azu n’obodo Algeria nwere onwe ya ohuu ikuzi maka film directing."" This directly implies that Algeria had gained independence *around* 1960, as he was returning *to* an independent Algeria to teach. 

The other options are incorrect based on the passage's information."
Ebee ka etinyeghị ihe onyonyo maka ọrụ olili?,"The correct answer is **A: Rome nile**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""many large screens were placed in *various locations in Rome* so that people could follow the ceremony."" This directly answers the question of where screens *were* placed, and therefore implies they weren't in all of Rome. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: N'ọtụtụ obodo Ịtali** - The passage says screens were in other Italian cities *in addition* to Rome.
*   **C: N'ebe Polish akọwapụtara** - The passage says celebrations took place in Poland, but doesn't mention screens being set up *there*.
*   **D: Gburugburu ogige St. Peter** - While the passage mentions St. Peter's Square, it says screens were placed in *various locations in Rome*, not specifically around the square.



"
Olee ebe e mere ememe ncheta?,"The correct answer is **A: N'ofe Rome niile, n'ebe dị iche iche**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ihe karịrị nde mmadụ anọ gara Rom maka olili ahụ."" and ""...etinyere ọtụtụ nnukwu igwe onyonyo n'ọtụtụ ebe na Rom..."" This indicates the memorial was held *throughout* Rome, in various locations, not just at St. Peter's Square.
* **B: N'ime Poland** is incorrect because Poland held *similar* events, it wasn't the primary location.
* **C: Gburugburu ogige St. Peter** is too narrow. While St. Peter's Square was a focal point, the event spread beyond just the immediate vicinity.
* **D: Na Rome mbụ, emesia obodo Italy ọzọ** is incorrect as the text says that events were also held in other Italian cities *and* around the world, not just after Rome.

The passage states: ""...ọ bụrụ mmadụ ise nọ n’ebe ahụ mgbe ihe mgbawa ahụ gbawara ka agwọrọ maka mgbaàmà nkụja."" This directly translates to ""if five or more people were present when the explosion occurred, they were treated for smoke inhalation symptoms."""
Onye kwuru na mgbaze gas ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Onye n'ime ulo** (Someone inside the house).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mgbe otu onye-agbata-obi kpochara banyere mmiputa nke mmanu-oku gas."" (…when a resident reported a gas leak). This clearly indicates that someone *inside the house* reported the leak, leading to the explosion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ezigbo enyi na ụlọ ahụ** (A friend in the house) - While the person *could* be a friend, the text just says a ""resident"" (onye-agbata-obi), not specifically a friend.
*   **C: Onye ọrụ nke ụlọ ọrụ gas** (A worker from the gas company) - The gas company worker arrived *after* the leak was reported.
*   **D: Onye nlekọta ụlọ** (A caretaker/property manager) - The text doesn't mention a caretaker.

"Mmadụ ole nwụrụ na mwakpo a, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""Ndị nwụrụ na ya bụ Nicholas Alden, dị afọ 25, na Zachary Cuddeback, dị afọ 21."" This clearly indicates that two people died.
"
Kedu ngwa ọgụ gbara ọkụ n'oge ụfọdụ n'oge mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Ngwa agha Uka dara dị ka ọ tụwara ya n’isi ony nke ise."" This translates to ""The Uka weapon fired as it was thrown at the fifth image."" This clearly indicates Uka was the weapon discharged during the attack."
Kedu n'ime egwuregwu ndị a ka kọmitii Olympic kpebiri na ha agaghị etinye?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

Here's why:

The text states that squash, karate, and roller sports are *also* vying for inclusion in the Olympics, alongside rugby and golf. However, it doesn't say the committee has *decided* against any of them. It only says they are being considered. The question asks which sport the committee decided *not* to include. Since the text doesn't mention a decision against squash, rugby, karate or roller sports, but does mention baseball and softball were removed in 2005, it would seem the most accurate answer is squash, as it is still being considered as of the time of writing."
Kọmitii Olympic nke mba ụwa tozuru oke itinye n'ime egwuregwu ndị a na asọmpi a?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Rugby union, the governing body for rugby specifically, and golf were selected amongst five other sports to be considered for inclusion in the Olympics.""

The question asks which committee is eligible to be included in the games, and the text clearly indicates that the Rugby Union is one of the committees being considered.



"
Afọ ole ka Arthur Guinness gbazitere na mbụ ụlọ ebe a na-eme mmanya St. James' Gate Brewery?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Ka afọ 250 gasịrị..."" (After 250 years...). This directly answers the question of how many years have passed since Arthur Guinness first leased the brewery."
"Ego ole ka Guinness na-eme kwa afọ, na nkezi?","The correct answer is **D: 10**.

Here's why:

The text states Guinness generates over €10 billion (US$14.7 billion) *monthly*. To find the yearly revenue, you need to multiply that by 12.

€10 billion/month * 12 months/year = €120 billion/year

The closest answer choice to this amount is 10 (representing 10 billion - the monthly figure). While the actual yearly revenue is much higher, 10 is the only answer directly pulled from the given information.



"
Achọtara nje H5N1 na mba ole nke European Union?,"The correct answer is **C: Asaa**.

The passage states that France is the seventh EU country affected by the H5N1 outbreak, after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy. Therefore, the virus has been found in seven EU countries."
Ebee ka achọpụtara ikpe nje H5N1 kacha ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The text explicitly states that the H5N1 case was discovered ""in the east of France, near Lyon"" on Monday. While the text mentions other countries with cases, France is where the *most recent* case was found."
Olee mgbe Haiti nwetara ọrịa ikpeazụ tupu ndị ọrụ udo agbasa ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Oge nke 1800s**.

The text states: ""Tupu ndị agha abịarute, Haiti ezutebeghị nsogbu ndị metụtara ọrịa ahụ kemgbe oge ndị 1800."" This directly answers the question."
Kedu ụdị ihe mkpofu nyeere ọrịa ahụ aka ịgbasa site na ebe mbụ ya?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogige ndị UN**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""ọfụma mkpofu si na kampụ UN, nke na-akpata nje ịbanye nna nwaghara ụzọ nke osimiri Artibonite"" (waste from UN camps, which caused germs to enter the Artibonite River).  This means the waste from the UN camps directly contributed to the spread of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: iyi Artibonite:** While the river *spread* the disease, it wasn't the *source* of the contamination.
*   **C: Ebe alaọmajijiji nke 2010:** The earthquake created the need for the UN presence, but wasn't the direct cause of the cholera spread.
*   **D: Ụlọọrụ ikpe na ọchịchị onye kwuo uche ya na Haiti:** These entities investigated the outbreak, they didn't *cause* its spread.



"
Kedu ihe gọọmentị Irish chọrọ ime?,"The correct answer is **B: Webata usoro iwu siri ike maka iji ọgwụ eme ihe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the government is warning about the *need* for legislators to address the situation.** This implies they want new laws or stricter enforcement.
* **It mentions concerns about the ""legality"" of the drugs and the potential for prosecution.** This directly links to needing legal frameworks.
* **The Minister for Health expresses concern about the well-being of those affected by the changes to the law.**  This highlights the need to *control* drug use and its consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nye ndị dara ọgwụ ọjọọ ikpe (Punish drug abusers):** While prosecution is mentioned, the main focus isn't solely on punishment, but on addressing the overall legal situation.
* **C: Wetuo obi n'ụkpụrụ na-achịkwa iji ọgwụ eme ihe (Relax regulations on drug use):** The passage clearly indicates the opposite – a concern about the lack of legal control.
* **D: Na-akwado ọgwụ ike (Support drugs):** The passage expresses concern about the dangers and legality of the drugs.



"
Kedu ihe Ireland nyere iwu nwa oge?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọgwụ (Drugs)**.

Here's why:

The text states the government is concerned about ""nnabata ọgwụ ike ndị ahụ"" (the acceptance of those drugs) and ""ọgwụ e nyefere"" (drugs that were transferred). It also mentions changes relating to drugs becoming illegal. This clearly points to the temporary legalisation being about drugs.



"
Kedu mmejọ ka a na-enyocha onye eboro ebubo?,"The correct answer is **C: Omume mpụ** (Vandalism).

Here's why:

The passage states the person is being investigated for a ""violation of the law"" related to an alteration of a sign. Specifically, they changed an ""O"" to an ""e"" using tarpaulins. This act of deliberately altering property is **vandalism**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-awakpo (Assault):** Assault involves physical harm or threat of harm to a person. This isn't described in the passage.
*   **B: Mmerụ ahụ anụ ahụ (Physical Injury):** The passage specifically says the damage was *not* serious and no one was physically harmed.
*   **D: Ohi (Theft):** Theft involves taking someone else's property. The passage describes altering property, not taking it.



"
Kedu ihe onye a na-enyo enyo na-emeghị mgbe ọ gbanwere akara?,"The correct answer is **C: N'usoro imerụ ya ahụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states Kristof Gashi says the person under investigation was accused of *vandalism* but it wasn't destructive. It specifically says the changes were made using tarpaulins to *alter* the sign, changing an ""O"" to an ""e,"" **without causing substantial damage**.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hazie otu n'ime mkpụrụedemede ahụ.** - The text says the letter was *changed*, not just rearranged.
*   **B: Mee ihe ịrịba ama udo iji tinye ya** - The tarpaulins were used to *change* the letter, not simply apply a peace sign.
*   **D: Iji gbanwee ya, jiri tapaulins** - While true, this describes *how* it was done, not what wasn’t done.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka onye nkuzi Bekee Karno na-eboghị ya ebubo, dabere na akụkụ akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **B: Inwe mmekọrịta na nwa akwụkwọ (Having relationships with students)**.

Here's why:

*   **A: Imebi iwu nwebiisinka (Violating privacy law)** - The text states Karno was *accused* of violating privacy laws, but it wasn't confirmed with a verdict.
*   **C: Mmepụta nke mgbasa ozi na-enweghị ikike (Producing unauthorized media)** - The text specifically says he was accused of producing large-scale promotional materials without permission.
*   **D: okwu rụrụ arụ na klas (Speaking rudely in class)** - The text states it was alleged he spoke profanely in class.

The text states that a former student said Karno ""acted like a friend to students,"" which suggests a close relationship, but it *doesn't* say he was accused of anything improper *regarding* those relationships. There's no accusation of inappropriate conduct with students.



"
"Kedu onye Rolando Mendoza na-ejideghị, dabere na ebe a?","The correct answer is **B: Ndị ọrụ mmanye iwu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Rolando Mendoza, a former police officer, *took* hostages from among the tourists (ndị njem nleta).
*   It explicitly mentions he held tourists, children, and the elderly.
*   It states the photographer (onye lensman) was eventually *substituted* for an elderly woman, meaning Mendoza *did* hold the photographer at some point.
*   The passage does *not* indicate Mendoza held any law enforcement officers (ndị ọrụ mmanye iwu).

Therefore, the one group Rolando Mendoza did not hold hostage, based on the text, is law enforcement."
Kedu ndị ejidere na-akwadoghị n'ihu ọha na a tọhapụrụ ya na mbụ n'akụkụ a?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị ọbịa**.

The text states: ""Ndị ejigidere ejigide isii, tinyere ụmụaka na ndị okenye, ka ahapụrụ n'oge, ma ndị Filipino n'ese foto."" This means the hostages, including tourists (ndị ọbịa), were released.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndị tozuru okè** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Onye lensman** - The text describes a photographer being *replaced* by a hostage, not being a hostage themselves.
* **D: Ndị na-eto eto** - While children were among the hostages, this isn't a category that encompasses all those released.  ""Ndị ọbịa"" (tourists) is a broader and more accurate answer.

"Ònye na-anakọta mbinye aka iji mee ka alụmdi na nwunye nwoke ma ọ bụ nwanyị nwee iwu kwadoro na Brazil, dị ka e kwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Roberto Jefferson**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""The bill is currently in the hands of Roberto Jefferson."" This implies he is the one currently responsible for moving the legislation forward, which includes gathering signatures to present to the legislative assembly.  While Marta Suplicy initially proposed the bill, it is now with Roberto Jefferson. The people opposing the church are gathering signatures to demonstrate support to the legislative assembly."
Kedu onye ga-anata akwụkwọ mkpesa nke ndị ngagharị iwe ga-eweta?,"The correct answer is **C: National Assembly nke Brazil**.

Here's why:

The text states the protesters aim to deliver a petition with 1.2 million signatures to the ""National Assembly"" in November. This is the body they are trying to influence with their protest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụka Katọlik (Catholic Church):** While the Catholic Church is mentioned as opposing same-sex marriage, they are not the intended recipient of the petition.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as currently holding the bill, but isn't the target of the petition.
*   **D: Onye isi ala So Paulo (The Governor of São Paulo):** Marta Suplicy, a former mayor of São Paulo, initially proposed the bill, but the petition isn't being sent to the current governor.

"Gịnị mere obere oge tupu ndị na-ege ntị amalite imeghachi omume na ihu igwe, dabere na akaụntụ Armand Versace?","The correct answer is **A: Edu mmiri malitere ịda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka nkeji ise gachara e bidoro ihe ngosi a, ikuku ebido kuwe, ka nkeji ọzọ gachara, ikuku a na-eru ọsọ kilomita 70 kwa awa... **mmiri ebido zowe**, mana o ji iwe bịa..."" 

This directly translates to: ""Five minutes after the show started, the wind began to blow, another minute passed, the wind reached 70 kilometers per hour... **rain began to fall**, but it came with anger...""

The rain started *before* the reactions of fear and panic, and *before* the accounts of injuries and death were mentioned.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ bụ nkeji ise n'azụ ihe ngosi** - This marks the *start* of the weather changes, not the trigger for reaction.
* **C: Ifufe siri ike** - The strong wind came *after* the rain began.
* **D: Ọ chefuru onye ezinaụlọ ya** - This refers to a tragic outcome, not the initial event causing reaction.



"
"Kedu mgbe ifufe kacha sie ike malitere, dịka Versace siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Obere oge ka ihe ngosi malitere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka nkeji ise gachara e bidoro ihe ngosi a, ikuku ebido kuwe..."" (Five minutes after the show started, the wind began to blow...). This directly indicates the wind started shortly after the show began.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Na-eso mmiri ozuzo** (Following the rain) - The rain started *after* the wind.
*   **C: Mgbe nwanne ya nwanyị nwụsịrị** (When his sister died) - His sister's death is a separate event mentioned later, not when the wind started.
*   **D: Tupu ka akụ mmiri igwe** (Before the rain) - The wind started before the rain, but the question asks about *when it got strongest*, and the passage doesn't specify a peak strength, just the initial start.



"
Oke ifufe ole dị ịrịba ama ka ekwuru na ọwụwa anyanwụ nke 35°W tupu Fred?,"The correct answer is **B: Atọ**.

The passage states: ""...o bukwazi ajo ifufe nke ato enwegoro n’odida nke 35°W."" which translates to ""...and also three tropical storms had formed to the east of 35°W.""

Therefore, three tropical storms were noted east of 35°W before Fred."
Olee ụzọ Fred si na-eme njem mgbe ọ dị nso n’agwaetiti Cape Verde?,"The correct answer is **A: West**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fred nwere ikuku nke kilomita 105 kwa awa (165 km/h) ma na-aga n'akụkụ **nọtwest**.""  ""Nọtwest"" translates to ""west"".

Therefore, Fred is traveling **west** when near Cape Verde."
Kedu nke na-aga ngwa ngwa karịa ndị bu ya ụzọ?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""Na 802.11n, ọsịsọ ya ji nnukwu ihe kara nke ndị bu ya ụzọ; ya mere, ọrụ ọ na-arụpụta ga-eru 600Mbit/s."" This means 802.11n is faster than its predecessors. The passage doesn't give specific speeds for the others, but implies 802.11n is significantly faster."
Ruo kedu ókè 802.11n kwesịrị ịdị na-aga azụ dakọtara na 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: redio abụọ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that 802.11n can achieve backward compatibility with older standards (like 802.11b) *if* the base station/router has **dual radios** (one for 2.4GHz and one for 5GHz). This allows it to simultaneously support both the newer 802.11n standards and the older ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nnukwu ọsọ na-abawanye** - While 802.11n has a higher speed, that's not *why* it can be backward compatible.
*   **B: 802.11b nwere ike ịrụ ọrụ na 5.0 GHz** - 802.11b operates only at 2.4GHz.
*   **C: ọsọ nke 600 Mbit / s** - This is the speed of 802.11n, but it doesn't explain compatibility with older standards.



"
Egwuregwu igwu mmiri ole n'egwuregwu Commonwealth ka onye nrite ọla edo n'Olimpik akwadoro ịsọ mpi?,"The correct answer is **B: Atọ**.

The text states the Olympic gold medalist was aiming to compete in ""three events"" at the Commonwealth Games: the 100m and 200m freestyle, and a third event."
Kedu ihe mere na onye mgbanye ọlaedo Olympic anọghị na-aṅụ ọgwụ maka ahụ mgbu ya?,"The correct answer is **D: N'egwuregwu Commonwealth, amachibidoro ya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...n’ihi mkpesa ya, enweela obi abụọ maka ịdị mma nke ahụike ya. O nwebeghị ike ịn̄ụ ọgwụ ndị ahụ o kwesịrị iji merie mgbu ya dị ka a machibidoro ha iwu site n’Egwuregwu."" This directly translates to ""due to his complaint, there has been doubt about his health. He has been unable to take the medications he needs to overcome his pain as they are banned by the Games.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ nọghị na ahụ erughị ala** - The passage doesn't mention he isn't fit enough.
*   **B: Ọ rịara ya ọrịa** - The passage doesn't mention illness.
*   **C: Ọ nọ na-echegbu onwe ya na ọ nwere ike imetụta ahụike ya nke ọma** - While he has health concerns, the *reason* he can't take the drugs is because they're banned, not due to his own worries.



"
"Gịnị nwere ike ịkpata mgbagwoju anya banyere ọrụ ala ọma jijiji, ma ọ bụrụ na akụkụ ahụ ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **A: Mkpuchi igwe ojii nke gbara ọchịchịrị (Dark cloud cover)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Akọrọ akụkọ igwe ojii n'enweghị ihe gbasara ha n'ihe omume ugwu mgbawa n'ụkwụ ugwu ahụ"" (Dark cloud reports were made with no relation to volcanic activity).  It then goes on to say the cloud cover showed ""a possibility that could not be explained"" and ""deviations it had actually made"". This suggests the cloud cover was an anomaly that *looked* like seismic activity, causing the confusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nlebanya sitere n'ụlọ ọrụ meteorological Icelandic (Data from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** The text specifically states the Meteorological Office confirmed *no* seismic activity.
* **C: Nkọwa nke ala ọma jijiji gburugburu ụwa (Global seismic activity readings):** The USGS data showed no activity in Iceland, ruling this out.
* **D: A kọwo na mpaghara ndị ọzọ nke Iceland na-arụsi ọrụ ike (Reports that other areas of Iceland were highly active):** The text focuses specifically on the area around Hekla and doesn’t mention activity elsewhere contributing to the confusion.



"
Kedu mgbe ekwuru na mgbanwe akụkụ mere na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Tupu March 10**.

The passage states: ""...butere mgbanwe mere n'ụbọchị nke iri n'ọnwa Maachị..."" which translates to ""...caused changes made on the tenth of March...""  However, it also says the changes *preceded* March 10th, as the earthquake occurred *before* that date.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Awa 48 gara aga:** The text mentions 48 hours regarding seismic activity at Hekla, but not related to the changes mentioned.
* **C: Na Maachị 10:** The changes happened *before* March 10th.
* **D: N'izu gara aga:** While the USGS map shows no activity in the last week, the specific change occurred before March 10th.



"
Kedu n'ime aro ndị a gbasara Chandrayaan-1's lunar lander bụ ụgha?,"The correct answer is **A: Enwere ndị ọrụ na orbiter nke malitere nyocha ahụ.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states ""Igwe nfegharị ọnwa a na-akpọ Chandrayaan-1 nke **mmadụ anọghị nyụpụrụ** Moon Impact Probe (MIP) ya."" This means there were *no people* onboard the orbiter, therefore, no crew launched the probe.

Let's look at why the other options are true, based on the passage:

*   **B: Ejiri ngwaọrụ ndị dị mkpa rụọ nyocha ahụ** - The passage states ""Karịa ngwa sayensị atọ dị mkpa o bu..."" (More than three important scientific instruments were used).
*   **C: Ewepụrụ nyocha ahụ nke ọma** - The passage states the probe ""mechaa kpọkasịa na nso Ọwụwa Anyanwụ nke ọnwa"" (eventually crashed near the lunar east pole) indicating successful deployment.
*   **D: A na-achọ akụkụ nke nyocha ahụ mma** - The passage implies this by mentioning it took a detailed image of India.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kacha kọwaa nyocha ọnwa?,"The correct answer is **C: E si n'ụgbọ mmiri na-agba agba agbapụta ya** (It was ejected from a speeding spacecraft).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) was *ejected* from the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft and was traveling at a high speed (1.5 km/minute). This is a key detail about how the probe undertook its lunar exploration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O mere ọdịda dị nso n'osisi ugwu nke ọnwa** (It made a close landing on the lunar south pole) - The passage says it *impacted* the moon near the east, not a landing.
*   **B: Ọ dabara nke ọma ọdịda mkpọka** (It made a perfect impact) - The passage doesn't state it was a ""perfect"" impact, only that it impacted.
*   **D: O nwere ngwaọrụ abụọ dị mkpa na ya** (It had two important instruments on it) - The passage mentions *more than three* important scientific instruments, not just two."
"Kedu usoro mgbochi ọrịa nke a ga-etinye n'ọnọdụ ikpeazụ, metụtara akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: ọgwụgwọ maka encephalitis** (treatment for encephalitis).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions the government's promise of ""ọgwụ mgbochi ensefalitis dị nde kwuru nde""** (millions of doses of encephalitis vaccine). This indicates that the primary preventative measure being discussed is a vaccine *for* encephalitis.
* The passage also mentions other measures like spraying pesticides and containing the disease, but the main focus of the preventative effort detailed is the vaccine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ogwu ogwu** (medicine/drugs) - Too general; the passage specifics a vaccine for encephalitis.
* **B: ọnyà maka ezi** (tests for fever) - Mentioned as a part of the initial problem/reporting, not a preventative measure.
* **D: ụgbụ anwụnta** (mosquito nets) - Mentioned as a measure taken, but not the *primary* preventative measure discussed in detail.



"
Kedu ka ọrịa si esi na anụmanụ agbasa ndị mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Anwụnta**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ezi na ebu ọrịa ahụ, nke **anwụnta** na ebunyezi ndị mmadụ.""  This translates to ""The source of the disease, which **ants** spread to people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ogwu na-egbu pesti:** The text mentions pesticides being sprayed, but not as the *source* of the disease transmission from animals to humans.
*   **C: Ezi:** ""Ezi"" refers to a location or region, not how the disease spreads.
*   **D: ọnyà maka ezi:** This translates to ""blame for ezi"" and is also unrelated to the method of transmission.



"
Kedu ihe nwere ike ime ma ọ bụrụ na ahịrịokwu nke abụọ dara?,"The correct answer is **B: A ga-emecha kwe ka mmekọ nwoke na nwoke na nwanyị** (Marriage between men and women will finally be allowed).

Here's why:

The passage states that the second clause, which effectively banned same-sex marriage, *if removed* would open the door for civil unions. This implies that if the clause failed (or ""fell""), same-sex marriage would become permissible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A ga-enyocharịrị HJR-3 ozugbo** (HJR-3 would be reviewed immediately) - While HJR-3 might be revisited, the passage doesn't say it *would* be immediately, only that it *could* be in 2015 or 2016.
*   **C: Nzukọ pụrụ iche nke ndị omebe iwu** (A special session of lawmakers) - The passage does not mention anything about a special session.
*   **D: anabataghị mmekọ nwoke na nwoke na nwanyị** (Same-sex marriage would not be allowed) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The clause's failure would *allow* it.

"Kedu mgbe e wepụrụ ahịrịokwu nke abụọ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: N'afọ 2011**.

The passage states: ""Ndozigharị iwu achọrọ agafeela ụlọ abụọ ahụ na 2011."" and ""E mere otu mgbanwe n’oge imeiwu a..."". This clearly indicates the change, including the removal of the second clause, happened in 2011."
"""Kedu onye a gwara maka mwepu """"Panama Papers""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Mossack Fonseca**.

Here's why:

The text clearly states, ""Panama Papers is the name given to around 11.5 million documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca..."".  The papers *were about* Mossack Fonseca's activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mgbasa ozi (The media)** - While the media *reported* on the Panama Papers, they weren't the source or the subject of the leak.
*   **C: German Bank (Deutsche Bank)** - The text mentions Deutsche Bank's involvement, but the leak itself came from Mossack Fonseca.
*   **D: Ndị isi ọchịchị Iceland (Icelandic government officials)** - They were *implicated* by the Panama Papers, but didn't leak them.

*   **B: Azụmahịa iwu kwadoro na Panama** - Mossack Fonseca (the Panamanian law firm) facilitated the activity, but wasn't accused of *running* other companies.

* **B: Ihe mberede nke onye uwe ojii chopper** (The accident of the police chopper) - This only resulted in 3 deaths and 3 injuries.
* **C: Mgbe ụgbọ elu ahụ siri Armenia gawa Iran, ụgbọ elu ahụ dara** (When the plane came from Armenia to Iran, the plane crashed) - The text says the plane was *going to* Armenia, not coming from Armenia.
* **D: Na Mashhad, otu ụgbọ elu dara** (In Mashhad, a plane crashed) - This resulted in 17 deaths, which is fewer than the 168 deaths in the Armenia-bound plane crash.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe kpatara ọtụtụ ihe mberede ụgbọ elu Iran nwere?,"The correct answer is **B: ụkọ ego maka ịzụrụ ụgbọ elu ọhụrụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ntarama-ahuhu nke mba uwa putara na agaghi azutali ugbo-elu ohuru"" (International sanctions resulted in the inability to purchase new aircraft). This means sanctions are *preventing* the purchase of new planes, not that a lack of funds is the reason.
* **The passage *directly supports* the other options:**
    * **A: ụgbọ elu ndị agha na ụgbọ elu obodo emechiela** (military and civilian aircraft are aging) - The text mentions poorly maintained aircraft.
    * **C: Mmachi na inweta ụgbọ elu ọhụrụ** (restrictions on obtaining new aircraft) - This is directly stated via the sanctions.
    * **D: ụgbọ elu nke nọ n'ọnọdụ ọjọọ** (aircraft in poor condition) - This is a consequence of the aging aircraft and poor maintenance.

Therefore, a lack of funding isn't stated as a *cause* – sanctions preventing purchases are the roadblock.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ nke akụkọ Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Mkpọsa na ịrị elu nke ime ihe ike na Iraq nwere ike kwụsị na kpọmkwem jikoro.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the Iraq Study Group cautioned that *no one can guarantee* any current course of action will end the fighting, violence, or instability. Option B suggests a definite outcome of stopping violence, which contradicts the report's warning.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the story:

*   **A: Mmegide na ntuziaka ugbu a** - The report criticizes existing policies and calls for changes.
*   **C: Aro maka ichekwa oke ala Iraq** - The first of the 79 recommendations is about protecting Iraq's borders.
*   **D: Oku maka nkwenye US** - The report starts with an appeal for dialogue and consensus in the US regarding how to address the Middle East.



"
Kedu n'ime ndụmọdụ ndị a ka Otu Ọmụmụ Iraq na-emeghị na akụkọ ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka e kwere nkwa ịkwụsị ime ihe ike na-abawanye ụba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ọ dọrọ aka na ntị sị na onweghị onye ga-ekwe nkwa na usoro ọbụla e jiri mee ihe na mba Aịrak ugbu a ga-akwụsị agha otu, ntolite ihe ike, maọbụ ndabanye n'ọgbaghara.""  This means the study group *did not* promise an end to violence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mgbanwe ozugbo na N'ezie (Immediate changes)** - The passage says the group ""kwado mgbanwe ụzọ ozigbo ozigbo"" (supports immediate changes).
* **C: Iji oghe mkparịta ụka (Open dialogue)** -  Di Rịpọt ""bidoro site n'ịkpọ oku ka onye ọbụla nwee mkpakọrịta ụka"" (started by calling for open dialogue).
* **D: Mmalite nke mgbalị diplomatic ọhụrụ (Start of new diplomatic efforts)** -  The call for dialogue with America could be seen as a new diplomatic effort.



"
Kedu onye ndị uwe ojii chere na ọ bụ aka nri Provenzano?,"The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndị uwe ojii kwuru na Lo Pikolo bụ onye ka dị ike maka na ọ rụọrọla Provenzano ọrụ na Palemo dị ka onye nnọchiteanya...""  This directly translates to ""The police said that Lo Piccolo was more powerful because he had done Provenzano's work in Palermo as a representative...""

Therefore, the police considered Lo Piccolo to be Provenzano's right-hand man.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Giovanni Falcone:** The passage states Falcone was a victim of the Mafia, not an associate of Provenzano.
*   **C: Ansa:** Ansa is the person *reporting* the information, not someone the police identified as connected to Provenzano.
*   **D: Paolo Borsellino:** Similar to Falcone, Borsellino was a victim of the Mafia.



"
"Kedu ihe kpatara ọnwụ Falcone, na-ekpe ikpe site na ozi dị na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ lara n'iyi na esemokwu Riina kpatara** (It stemmed from the Riina conflict).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...agha Riina nke megidere steeti nke weere ndụ ndị agha ntụgharị Mafia bụ Giovanni Falkon na Paolo Borsellino n'afọ 1992."" This directly links the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino to the conflict with Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị uweojii gbagburu ya** (The police killed him) - The text doesn't mention the police being involved in Falcone's death.
*   **C: Lo Piccolo nwetara iwu ka e gbuo ya** (Lo Piccolo ordered his assassination) - The text says Lo Piccolo was powerful but doesn't state he ordered Falcone's death. He is mentioned in relation to Provenzano's power.
*   **D: Paolo Borsellino, onye na-alụ ọgụ Mafia, gburu ya** (Paolo Borsellino, a Mafia fighter, killed him) - This is incorrect; Borsellino was *also* killed in the same conflict.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a Hitoshi Saito enweghị?,"The correct answer is **D: Okaibe na Judo**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hitoshi Saito was a Judo *practitioner* and a two-time Olympic medalist. It does *not* say he held a Judo *rank* or *degree* (like a black belt - ""okaibe"" likely refers to a rank).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ọkaibe mba uwa ugboro abụọ** - The passage says he was a world champion (""onye mmeri n’egwuregwu ụwa"").
*   **B: Onye isi oche kọmitii Judo Federation niile nke Japan** - The passage explicitly states he was the chairman of the Japan Judo Federation (""onye isi oche kọmiti ozuzu egwuregwu Japan Judo Federation"").
*   **C: Onye meriri ọla edo n'egwuregwu Olympic abụọ** - The passage states he was a two-time Olympic gold medalist (""onye meriri onyinye ọla edo nke Olimpik ugboro abụọ"")."
Iwasaki zere ikwe nkwa ebe?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""o siri na-alụm di na nwunye gbalaga na Nepal a tụọ ya nga na India."" This translates to ""He was running away from his wife and husband and fled to Nepal and was chased to India.""  Therefore, Iwasaki was fleeing *from* Nepal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Japan:** The text doesn't mention him fleeing from Japan.
*   **C: India:** He was *chased to* India, not fleeing from it.
*   **D: Tibet:** Tibet is not mentioned in the text."
Kedu onye Iwasaki wakporo?,"The correct answer is **C: Nkịta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nkịta ara lụsoro ya ọgụ"" which translates to ""dogs fought with him."" This directly indicates that dogs attacked Iwasaki.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye na-atụ anya ya (His expectation)** - The text doesn't mention anyone he expected or a conflict with expectations.
*   **B: Ndị na-azụ ahịa (Traders)** - The passage mentions he was robbed by ship pirates (""ndị ohi ụgbọ mmiri zuri ya ohi"") but does not indicate he attacked anyone in trade.
*   **D: Ndị ọrụ mmanye iwu (Law enforcement)** - There's no mention of any conflict with law enforcement.



"
Kedu mgbe Alonso gbachara ọsọ ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ozugbo na-esochi mmebi wheel n'ihu Schumacher**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Michael Schumacher crashed out unexpectedly after Alonso, possibly due to a suspension failure from numerous battles during the race."" This directly implies Alonso crashed *before* Schumacher, and Schumacher's crash was a subsequent event. Therefore, Alonso's race ended right after Schumacher's issue began.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ụgbọ ala Fisichella apụọla n'aka** - Fisichella's retirement happened earlier, it doesn't relate to Alonso's.
*   **C: Mgbe Schumacher gụchara asọmpi ahụ** - Schumacher didn't finish, and Alonso crashed before him.
*   **D: Mgbe ahụ, m butere ụzọ** - This is a nonsensical option and not connected to the text.



"
Ọ bụ n'ihi gịnị ka nchucha agbụrụ mbụ Schumacher mere?,"The correct answer is **D: Nsogbu nkwusioru na ụgbọ ala** (Suspension issues with the car).

The text specifically states: ""Michael Schumacher crashed out unexpectedly after Alonso, due to suspension damage from numerous battles during the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O ji ụgbọala ya mee ihe n'ụzọ na-ezighị ezi** (He did something wrong with his car) - The text doesn't mention any driver error.
*   **B: Mụ na Alonso gbakọrọ** (I collided with Alonso) - The text doesn't say Schumacher collided with Alonso.
*   **C: Mmebi Fisichella na wiilị** (Fisichella's damage to the wheel) - Fisichella's issue happened at the start, and Schumacher's crash was later, due to suspension.



"
"Ọrụ onye ka ọ bụ, dabere na ngalaba ahụ, ikpebi mgbapụta onye ejidere?","The correct answer is **D: Kọmishọna ọkaikpe** (Commissioner of Law).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kọmishọna na ewepụta ụgwọ mgbapụta, ọbụrụ na ekwenye na ya, ma hazie ụgwọ akwụkwọ onye jidere onye omekome gbara ya."" 

This directly translates to: ""The Commissioner shall issue bail, if approved, and set the bond for the person who arrested the offender.""

Therefore, the Commissioner is responsible for deciding on bail. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye ọrụ na-eme njide** (Arresting Officer): The arresting officer makes the initial arrest, but doesn't decide on bail.
*   **B: Glynn, Onyeikpe** (Glynn, Judge): Glynn issued a temporary injunction, but the passage doesn't mention Glynn deciding bail.
*   **C: Isi ọrụ ndoputa** (Chief Prosecutor): The passage doesn't say the prosecutor decides bail.



"
"Kedu ihe a ga-ahapụrịrị ka ndị ejidere nwee ka ejidere ihe karịrị awa 24, dịka iwu mgbochi nwa oge siri dị n'akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ ntọhapụ**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Kọmishọna na ewepụta ụgwọ mgbapụta, ọbụrụ na ekwenye na ya, ma hazie ụgwọ akwụkwọ onye jidere onye omekome gbara ya."" This means the commissioners will set a bail amount, and if agreed upon, arrange for the bond for those held over 24 hours without a magistrate's warrant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndụmọdụ ya na onye ọrụ njide** - The text doesn't mention advice from a detention officer.
*   **C: Ọkaikpe Glynn gbara akwụkwọ ebubo** - Judge Glynn issued the temporary restraining order, but isn't something *required* to be released.
*   **D: Anụ ahụ** - There is no mention of physical evidence in the context of release conditions.



"
Kedu ihe ziri ezi ewepụrụ na akụkụ ahụ iji kọwaa kagbuo ọsọ ọsọ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: ihe ize ndụ na nchekwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the rerun was cancelled due to ""oke mmefu ego makwa n'aka ihe na-emegide nchekwa na-esote ntuli aka"" – which translates to ""extreme financial risks and security threats following the election.""  This directly points to the concerns about danger and security as the reason for the cancellation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esemokwu na Iwu (Legal Disputes):** While there was a mention of concerns about the legal process, it was stated that representatives didn't *see* clear legal inconsistencies. It wasn't the primary reason for cancellation.
* **C: nnukwu ọnụ ahịa (High Costs):**  The passage mentions financial risks, but doesn't emphasize *high cost* as the main driver.  Security concerns were more prominent.
* **D: Ejighi n'aka na iwu (Uncertainty with the Law):** Similar to B, uncertainty wasn't the key issue. The passage focuses on *threats* to security.

Gịnị kpatara na ndị nnọchi anya mba ụwa mechara kweta na ịgba ọsọ ahụ adịghị mkpa?,"The correct answer is **C: Usoro iwu edoghị anya n'ebe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndị nnọchiteanya mbà kwuru na ha ahụghị ezigbi ihe mgbagwujuanya n’usoro iwu ndị Afghan iji kpebie n’usoro ntụziaka ahụ ezighị ezi."" This directly translates to ""The international representatives said they did not see genuine irregularities in the Afghan legal process to determine the invalid direction.""  This means they found flaws in how the legal process was conducted, making the rerun unnecessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O mebiri iwu:** While the passage implies issues with the legal process, it doesn't state the law itself was broken, but rather that the *process* to decide the direction was flawed.
*   **B: Ihe iyi egwu nchekwa dị:** The passage mentions security concerns as a reason for considering the rerun, but not as the reason why the representatives ultimately found it unnecessary.
*   **D: Ntuli aka ahụ furu nnukwu ego:**  The passage mentions ""oke mmefu ego"" (excessive cost) as a reason for *wanting* a winner, but not as the reason why the representatives decided the rerun was unwarranted.



"
Onye na-enye ọrụ iwu FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị nnọchi anya ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị** (Political Agents).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Ndị ọrụ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị"" (Political Agents) are appointed by the Pakistani government to govern FATA and administer government duties and justice under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị ọchịchị Pakịstan** (Pakistani Government) - While the Pakistani government *appoints* the Political Agents, they don't directly handle the day-to-day governance and duties in FATA themselves.
*   **C: Onye isi ala Pakịstan** (President of Pakistan) - The passage doesn't mention the President being directly involved in administering FATA.
*   **D: Ndị ọchịchị Britain** (British Government) -  The passage states FATA came under Pakistani control *in 1947*, meaning British rule ended then.



"
"""Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara """"Ndị nnọchi anya ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị"""" nke FATA bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?""","The correct answer is **A: Ha na-enye enyemaka iwu** (They provide legal assistance).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Political Agents are responsible for *administering* government services and *dispensing justice* under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.  ""Dispensing justice"" means they *administer* the law, they don't *provide assistance with* the law.  They *are* the law in that context.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Onye isi ala Pakịstan họpụtara ha** (They are appointed by the President of Pakistan) - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: Ha na-agbaso iwu Pakịstan** (They follow Pakistani law) -  They operate under Article 247 of the Pakistan Constitution.
*   **D: Ụfọdụ ebe nọ kpamkpam n'okpuru ha** (Some areas are completely under them) - The passage says the President can allow them to have full administrative control.



"
Kedu ihe nrite ka akpọrọ Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Onye na-eme ihe nkiri kachasị mma**.

The passage states that both Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress (Onye na-eme ihe nkiri kacha mma). While ""Onye na-eme ihe nkiri kacha mma na-akwado nwanyị"" is a valid award, the text doesn't specify that Emma Stone was nominated for *that* particular award, only Best Actress generally."
Kedu ihe nsọpụrụ fim ahụ enwetaghị nhọpụta maka?,"The correct answer is **B: Mmetụta Ọhụụ mara mma**.

The passage lists all the categories the film *was* nominated for. ""Visual Effects"" (Mmetụta Ọhụụ) is **not** on that list.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Foto kacha pụta ìhè** - The passage specifically states it was nominated for ""Foto Kacha"" (Best Cinematography).
* **C: Ngwakọta ụda kacha mma** - The passage mentions a nomination for ""Ọrụrụ Ụda"" and ""Mwụghari Ụda"" which relate to sound mixing.
* **D: Egwu izizi mara mma** - The passage states it was nominated for ""Exigbo Egwu fiim Mbu"" (Best Original Song).



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka na-agba ọsọ mgbe ala ọma jijiji ahụ gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọdụ ụgbọ elu Ishikawa**.

Here's why:

The text states ""ọdụ ụgbọelu Ishikawa ka mechiri emechi"" (Ishikawa Airport is closed). This indicates it's still affected *after* the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Igwe ọkụ niile nọ n'ụlọọrụ Shika dị na Hokuriku** – The text says the fires at the Shika nuclear plant were *extinguished* (""emebighi ihe n'igwe ọkụ"").
* **C: Ọrụ ụgbọoloko niile** – The text states train travel was *suspended* (""kwụsịtụ njem ụgbọ oloko"") in affected areas, not that all operations were still running.
* **D: Ụlọ ọrụ ike na Niigata** – The text only mentions a concern at the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant but doesn't say it's still actively operating with issues.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ala ọma jijiji ahụ mebiri, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: ụzọ ụfọdụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O mebiri ụfọdụ ụzọ, kwụsịtụ njem ụgbọ oloko n'ebe ndị o metụtara, ma ọdụ ụgbọelu Ishikawa ka mechiri emechi."" This directly translates to ""Some roads were damaged, train transport was suspended in the affected areas, and Ishikawa Airport was closed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụfọdụ ụlọ** - While the passage mentions 9400 homes without water, it doesn’t say the earthquake *damaged* homes.
*   **B: Igwe ọkụ abụọ nọ n'ụlọọrụ Shika** - The passage says these were *not damaged* by the earthquake.
*   **D: Ọdụ ụgbọ elu dị na Noto** - It specifies Ishikawa Airport was closed, not Noto Airport.

"Kedu n'ime isiokwu ndị a na-ekwughị n'akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Atụmatụ ọdịnihu maka Jerusalem**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Isiokwu ndị ọzọ ekpuchiri gụnyere **site n'ihe akọrọ ọdịnihu Jerusalem** nke dị nsọ nye mba abụọ ahụ..."" This directly indicates that the future of Jerusalem is discussed.
*   **B: mgbọrọgwụ nke esemokwu nke 1967** - The text mentions the borders *before* the 1967 war as a basis for Palestinian claims, indicating the dispute is covered.
*   **C: e nwere ndị agha nọ na ndagwurugwu** - The text explicitly discusses the presence of troops in the Jordan Valley (""ndagwurugwu Jọdan"") and the disagreement over how long they should remain.
*   **D: Esemokwu n'oke oke** - The passage begins by stating the document addresses ""ụmụ mgbagha oke ala ndị ahụ, nke Palestaịnụ chọrọ na-ndabere n’ụmụ oke ala tupu Agha Mideast 1967 ahụ."" This clearly indicates a discussion of border disputes.

Therefore, the only topic explicitly mentioned as being *covered* in the document is the future plans for Jerusalem."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe Palestine chọrọ?,"The correct answer is **B: ndị agha ka dị na ndagwurugwu Jọdan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Palestine wants the Ndagwurugwu Jọdan to have a military presence for **five** years. Israel wants **ten** years. So, Palestine *does* have a requirement regarding the military presence in the Ndagwurugwu Jọdan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dabere na ọnọdụ tupu agha maka oke ala** – The passage explicitly states Palestine wants land based on pre-1967 borders.
*   **C: Azịza nke ọdịnihu Jerusalem** – The passage mentions Jerusalem's future status as a sensitive issue for both sides, implying Palestine has a stake in it.
*   **D: Ndagwurugwu Jọdan nwere ọnụnọ ndị agha afọ ise** - This *is* what Palestine wants, so it cannot be the answer.

The passage states: ""A mụrụ ya na Họng Kọng, Ma gụrụ akwụkwọ na Mahadum nke Niu Yọk, makwa Mahadum Ikpe nke Havad..."" This translates to ""He was born in Hong Kong, Ma studied at New York University and also Harvard Law School...""

Therefore, Ma went to law school in Hong Kong.
"
"Dị ka paragraf ahụ si kwuo, ọ̀tụ̀tụ̀ akabatara mmeri nhoputa ndi ochichi Ma kedu mba?","The correct answer is **A: obodo Amerịka**.

The passage states that Hsieh claimed Ma had a ""lasting book"" (likely meaning citizenship) in the United States. This is directly related to how Ma won the election despite the accusations against him, as he had support in a party favoring closer ties with the US.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hong Kong:** Ma was *born* in Hong Kong, but the passage doesn't say his election victory was tied to support from Hong Kong.
*   **C: United Kingdom:** The passage doesn't mention the United Kingdom.
*   **D: Óbodo Chaịna:** The party Ma won with favored *closer ties* with China, but his win was facilitated by support in the United States.

"Ònye bụ onye were Carolyn Wilson n'ọrụ tupu ọ pụọ n'obodo, dị ka akọwara n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Nke a OHA**.

"
Onye nọ n'ọkwa nke anọ n'asọmpi ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala nwere asọmpi anọ fọdụrụ n'afọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's how we can figure that out from the text:

* The text states Hamlin is third and is ""five ahead of Bowyer"".
* Therefore, Bowyer must be in fourth place."
Isi isi ole Kahne nwere na asọmpi ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala ka agbachara agbachara ahụ aka n'akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The text states: ""Kahne na Truex, Jr. bụ ndị nke ise na isii n'otu n'otu ma nwee pọyịnt 2,220 na 2,207.""  Since Kahne is listed first in that pair, he has 2,220 points and Truex, Jr. has 2,207 points. The question asks for Kahne's points.

Therefore, the answer is 2,220.

"Ugboro ole ka ndị mmadụ hụla ka meteorite dara bụ nke mechara pụta na Mars, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ na-ekwu?","The correct answer is **B: ugboro ise**.

* **The passage states:** ""N’ime okwute si eluigwe 24,000 ama ama dara na ụwa, naanị ihe dị ka 34 ka egosiri na ha bụ ndị nwere mbido Martian.""  This directly supports answer D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Achọpụtara ha niile n'oge ịsa ahụ meteor nke July.** - The passage states 15 were found in a meteorite that fell in July, not *all* of them.
* **B: 24,000 n'ime ha bụ mkpokọta** - 24,000 is the *total* number of meteorites studied, not the number that are Martian.
* **C: Ha dị $11,000 ọnụ karịa ọla edo** - The passage states they are worth *up to* $22,500 per ounce, which is about ten times the price of gold. It doesn't state they cost $11,000 *more* than gold.

Schumacher lara ezumike nká mgbe?,"The correct answer is **B: Mgbe mmeri asọmpi nke asatọ ya gasịrị**.

Here's why:

The text states Schumacher retired *after* winning his seventh championship in 2006. The Felipe Massa accident happened later in 2009 and is presented as a separate event, not the reason for Schumacher's initial retirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbe ihe mberede Felipe Massa mere** - The text doesn't say Schumacher retired *because* of Massa's accident.
*   **C: Mgbe Felipe Massa nọchiri anya ya** - The text doesn't mention Massa replacing Schumacher.
*   **D: na-esote oge 2009** - Schumacher retired in 2006, not after 2009.



"
Mgbe Massa merụrụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: oge nke Grand Prix**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Onye Brazil a merụrụ ahụ n'isi mgbe moto ya kpọkasịrị n'ọsọ moto Grand Prix 2009 na Họngarị."" This translates to ""The Brazilian was injured in the head when his car crashed in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Na-esochi mmeri asọmpi Formula 1:** The text doesn't mention the injury happening after a Formula 1 victory.
*   **C: tupu oge ezumike nka Schumacher:** The text says Schumacher retired *before* Massa's injury, not the other way around.
*   **D: N'ihu nke oge 2009:** While it happened in 2009, the text specifies it happened *during* a Grand Prix (a race) within that year, not simply ""before"" the entire season.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL could ""dominate and potentially start the IM market"" because of a single dominant player in the US. However, it *also* states that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft would surpass AOL’s customer base. This implies that Microsoft and Yahoo would become significant competitors to AOL, effectively countering its potential dominance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị ọrụ nke AOL ga-arị elu** - The passage suggests the opposite – AOL *could* dominate, but other companies will challenge that.
*   **B: Naanị AOL ga-emepụta ahịa IM** - The passage indicates other players (Yahoo & Microsoft) exist and will be competitive.
*   **D: Na United States, AOL agaghịzi eji** - The passage speaks of potential dominance, not obsolescence.



"
"Dị ka ndokwa ọhụrụ ahụ si dị, olee nke pụrụ ịkwụsị?","The correct answer is **C: Nnwere onwe maka AOL itolite ahịa n'ọsọ nke ya** (AOL's ability to grow the IM market at its own pace).

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL *could* control and launch the IM market as needed *because* of a certain agreement in the United States.  However, it then says that having this support ""could expire."" This directly relates to AOL losing its freedom/ability to grow the market on its own terms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ojiji ịntanetị etoola nke ukwuu na United States** (Internet usage has grown greatly in the United States) – This isn't directly addressed as something the agreement could stop.
* **B: Iji IM ahịa** (Using the IM market) – The passage discusses *controlling* the market, not just using it.
* **D: Mmekọrịta dị n'etiti Yahoo na Microsoft** (Collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft) – The passage mentions Yahoo and Microsoft users as a comparison, but the agreement's expiration doesn't affect their relationship.



"
Ole ndị e merụrụ na mwakpo a na-abụghị ndị uwe ojii?,"The correct answer is **D: 20**.

Here's why:

* The passage states a total of ""more than 20 people"" were injured.
* It then specifies that 19 of those injured were police officers.
* Therefore, to find the number of non-police officers injured, we subtract the number of injured police officers from the total number of injured people: More than 20 – 19 = 20.
"
Onye mere ka amara onye a na-enyo enyo na mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị uwe ojii** (The police).

The text states: ""Ndị uwe ojii sị na ha na-enyo otu onye a na-ebo ebubo na ọ bụ onye agha nnupuisi Daesh (ISIL) dịka onye mere mwakpo ahụ."" This directly translates to ""The police said they suspect a person accused of being a Daesh (ISIL) militant as the perpetrator of the attack.""

Therefore, the police are the ones identifying the suspect."
Kedu ihe e nyere Mitt Romney ebe ọ bụ na Florida bụ steeti onye mmeri na-ewere ọnọdụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị nnọchi anya 32 sitere na steeti ahụ** (32 delegates from the state).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dịka steeti onye meriri-na-ewere ihe niile, Florida nyere ndị nnọchi anya iri ise ha niile nye Romney...""  This directly indicates that Romney received all 50 of Florida's delegates. However, option A states 32 delegates. The correct number in the passage is 50, not 32.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ntuli aka nke Republican Party** - This is too broad. While the election *was* a Republican primary, it doesn't explain what Romney *received*.
*   **C: Ndị nnọchi anya steeti ọ bụla** - Romney didn't get delegates from *every* state, only Florida in this instance.
*   **D: Site na 46% nke votu** - The 46% refers to the percentage of votes he received, not what he was awarded.

Therefore, the passage indicates Romney was awarded 50 delegates as a result of winning Florida as a winner-take-all state. The closest answer is A, but the passage states 50 delegates and not 32."
"Kedu pasentị nke votu ahụ, dịka ekwuru na paragraf, Gingrich nwetara na primaries?","The correct answer is **B: 32 pasentị**.

The passage clearly states: ""Newt Gingrich ji pasentị 32 gbata onye nke abụọ."" (Newt Gingrich finished second with 32 percent of the vote.)"
"Ònye, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo, gbahapụrụ ịgba ọsọ na-eso rịzọlt caucus?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The passage states: ""Bakman, onye meriri Ntuliaka Ames Strọ n'Ọgọọst, kpebiri ịkwụsị kampen ya."" (Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, decided to end her campaign.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gingrich** - He gave a speech *after* the results, but didn't drop out.
*   **C: Perry** - He said he would assess the results but decided to *continue* the race.
*   **D: Romney** - He was criticized by Gingrich, but didn't drop out.



"
"Kedu onye toro onye ọzọ na-azọ ọkwa ka ọ gachara nsonaazụ caucus, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gingrich kelere Santorum..."" This means Gingrich praised another candidate (Santorum) after the caucus results. The other options did not praise anyone, and in Romney's case, was even *criticized* by Gingrich."
"Tupu afọ 2015, olee ebe naanị ebe a na-agbasa ihe ngosi ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""In its initial run, the show was exclusively broadcast on the fast-paced web station of TogiNet Radio, which focused on talk radio."" This clearly indicates TogiNet Radio was the *only* place the show aired before 2015.



"
Kedu ụdị ntugharị a na-egosi site na nkọwa ụlọ ọrụ nke mmemme ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Old school**.

Here's why:

* **The description explicitly mentions ""ihe ngosi redio ndị mgbe ochie"" (old radio shows)**. This directly points to a focus on a retro or classic style.
* The mention of ""TogiNet Radio"" and its evolution to ""AstroNet Radio"" suggests a history and tradition tied to older radio formats.
* The focus on spoken-word radio is also a hallmark of older radio programming.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Onye nkịtị (Mainstream)** – While potentially appealing to a broad audience, the description emphasizes a niche interest in *old* radio.
* **B: Geeky** – While it might appeal to radio enthusiasts, ""geeky"" doesn't capture the core essence of the show's described style.
* **D: Isiokwu mpaghara (Local Topic)** – The mention of East Texas is a detail, but the primary focus is on the *style* of radio, not specifically local content.



"
Kedu ozi David Headley chọpụtara nke mechara kwado mwakpo ndị otu ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ozi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""ọchịchọ na mkpokọta ozi nke David Headley enyerela aka ime ka arụmarụ ahụ nwee ike"". This directly translates to ""the intelligence and information gathering of David Headley helped enable the attack.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngwa agha (Weapons)** - While weapons were used, the passage highlights Headley's *information* as the key contribution.
* **C: Ndị ikom ji ngwa agha (Gunmen with weapons)** -  The passage mentions the gunmen, but Headley didn't *provide* them, he provided information.
* **D: ngwa agha na-agba ọkụ na-akpaghị aka (automatic weapons)** -  This is too specific and not the main point about Headley's contribution.



"
Otu ndị agha ahụ si n'ụzọ ụgbọ njem si gaa Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụgbọ mmiri**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndị mwakpọ Mumbaị ahụ jiri ụgbọmmiri wee bịa na Nọvemba 26, 2008..."" (The Mumbai attackers arrived by sea on November 26, 2008...)."
Kedu n'ime ndị a kacha kọwaa nsonaazụ Brisbane Open n'etiti Raonic na Nadal kwuru n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal meriri Raonic**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ihe ogo mmeri n'asọmụmpi nke ndị Nadal ji megide nke ndị Kanada bụ 7-2."" (The score of the match between Nadal's team and the Canadian team was 7-2.) and ""Nadal nwere 88% n’egwuregwu ahụ iji merie na 76 n’ọrụ izizi."" (Nadal had 88% in the game to win at 76 in the first serve.) These clearly indicate Nadal won the match against Raonic (representing the Canadian team).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic meriri Nadal** - The text explicitly states Nadal won.
*   **B: Raonic nwetara net 88%** - The 88% refers to Nadal's performance.
*   **D: Raonic gbakọtara 76** - The 76 refers to Nadal's first serve.



"
"Kedu ihe bụ ọnọdụ egwuregwu Nadal na Raonic mgbe ozi mbụ gasịrị, dịka akụkụ nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal nwetara 76 akara**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nadal nwere 88% n’egwuregwu ahụ iji merie na 76 n’ọrụ izizi."" This directly translates to ""Nadal had 88% in the game to win with 76 in the first serve.""  Therefore, Nadal scored 76 aces on his first serve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic nwetara net 88%** - The passage mentions 88% relating to Nadal's performance, not Raonic's.
*   **C: Ihe si na ya pụta bụ 7-2** - This refers to the overall score of the competition between Nadal's team and the Canadian team, not the specific game against Raonic.
*   **D: Raonic meriri Nadal** - The passage doesn't state that Raonic won; it only describes Nadal's performance.



"
Kedu otu n'ime mmemme atọ ọhụrụ a gba ọtọ na-anaghị egosipụta mmemme asụsụ?,"The correct answer is **C: onye Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Akụkọ Gba ọtọ *already* broadcasts in English and Japanese. The *new* programs are in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not one of the new languages being added.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: onye Italy** - Italian is one of the new languages.
*   **B: onye Korea** - Korean is one of the new languages.
*   **D: onye Spain** - Spanish is one of the new languages.



"
Ederede a na-ekwu na mgbasa ozi akụkọ gba ọtọ agaghị adị ebe ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Igwe onyonyo** (Television).

Here's why:

The passage states the news will be available on ""televishọn, weebụ, na ngwaọrụ mkpanaka.""  ""Igwe onyonyo"" directly translates to ""television"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ekwentị mkpanaaka** (Mobile phone) - While it mentions ""ngwaọrụ mkpanaka"" (mobile devices), that's a broader category than just mobile phones, and isn't the primary focus.
* **B: site na ịntanetị** (Via the internet) -  ""Weebụ"" means the internet, but the question asks *where* the news will be found, and television is specifically mentioned.
* **C: Ụlọ ihe nkiri nkiri** (Movie theater) - This isn't mentioned in the text at all.



"
Ndị egwuregwu ole na-emezughị Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""Skiers anọ nwanyị nọ n'otu ụmụ nwanyị dara ịgbacha ọsọ ha, na 45 n'ime skiers 117 nọ na Giant Slalom dara isonye na ndị gbatara ihe n'egwuregwu ahụ."" This directly answers the question - 45 skiers did not finish the Giant Slalom.



"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a kacha kọwaa ka asọmpi asọmpi ahụ siri pụta?,"The best answer is **C: Nnukwu Slalom hụrụ ka ndị skiers gwụchara karịa Slalom**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** 116 skiers competed in Slalom and 117 in Giant Slalom.  It also states 45 skiers *did not finish* the Giant Slalom, while only 36 had a 'fall' (which isn't necessarily the same as not finishing) in Slalom. This strongly suggests a higher rate of skiers not completing the Giant Slalom, meaning more skiers finished the Slalom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Carpenado meriri n'ọsọ nke abụọ n'ihu onye skier Hungarian** - This is incorrect. Carpanedo finished 11th in Giant Slalom, far behind the leaders.
* **B: Na Giant Slalom, ndị na-agba ọsọ 45 akwụsịghị ọsọ ha** - While true, this is a detail *about* the competition, not a summary of how it went overall.
* **D: Carpenado batara na ọnụọgụ iri na Slalom** - This isn’t mentioned in the text. It states she fell during her first run, not her overall ranking.



"
Ndị NBA kpebiri ịkwụsị nke n'ime ihe ndị a?,"The correct answer is **A: Oge bọọlụ basketbọl** (The basketball season).

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA ""kwụsịrị ogbe egwuregwu basketbọl ya"" (suspended its basketball season) because of COVID-19 concerns. The other options are too specific or incorrect:

* **B: Onye so na Utah Jazz** (The player on Utah Jazz) - While a player *triggered* the suspension, the NBA suspended the season, not just the player.
* **C: Ndị na-eme egwuregwu ọ bụla nwere nyocha COVID-19** (Anyone playing with a COVID-19 test) - This isn't what the NBA suspended.
* **D: Otu egwuregwu basketball Utah Jazz** (A Utah Jazz basketball game) - The suspension was broader than a single game.



"
"Kedu ihe kpaliri ndị NBA na-echegbu onwe ha banyere nje a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Mgbe anwalechara nke ọma, onye ọkpụkpọ maka Utah Jazz emeghị nke ọma**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the NBA suspended games because a Utah Jazz player *tested positive* for COVID-19.**  This means the player did *not* test well (the test showed they had the virus).
* The passage specifically mentions this player's positive test as the reason for the concern and suspension of games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn’t say all NBA players were tested. It only says a player tested positive.
* **B & D:**  These options state players tested *well* which is the opposite of the problem – the concern arose because of a *positive* test.



"
Kedu onye nyere ndị isi obodo Washington mmeri na Atlanta Thrashers na ihe mgbaru ọsọ mmeri egwuregwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states that Ovechkin's first assist of the game led to the game-winning goal scored by Nicklas Backstrom. Therefore, Backstrom scored the game-winning goal for the Washington Capitals against the Atlanta Thrashers."
"N'egwuregwu Capitals-Thrashers, onye nyere goolu 60th ya n'afọ?","The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Gol ya nke abụọ n'abalị ahụ bụ nke 60 ya n'afọ egwuregwu a, nke mere ya onye egwuregwu nke mbụ yọgoro gol 60 maọbụ karịa n'otu afọ egwuregwu kemgbe 1995-96..."" This means Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in that game.

Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr are mentioned as having reached 60 goals in a season *before* 1995-96, but not in *this* game. Nicklas Backstrom scored a goal assisted by Ovechkin, but did not score the 60th goal himself."
Kedu mgbe gọọmentị kwesịrị inyere Northern Rock Bank aka?,"The correct answer is **D: N'etiti nsogbu nnyefe ego**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Northern Rock sought support for its liquidity problems during a period of transferring subprime mortgages in 2007."" This directly indicates the government support was needed *during* the liquidity crisis related to risky mortgage lending.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: na-esote mba nke ụlọ akụ:** The bank was nationalized *after* receiving initial support, not before.
*   **B: Mgbe nkewapụ ụlọ akụ na ụlọ ọrụ na-ahụ maka akụrụngwa:** This happened much later in 2010, after the initial rescue.
*   **C: mgbe Virgin Group zụtara ụlọ akụ ahụ:** Virgin Group was interested in buying, but the initial support came before any deal with Virgin.



"
"Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara mmekọrịta Virgin Group na Northern Rock bank bụ eziokwu, dịka akụkụ nke a si dị?","The correct answer is **C: N'oge nsogbu ịgbazinye ego, Virgin Group nyere enyemaka mberede ụlọ akụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Otu Vejini nke Nnaukwu Richard Branson kweburu ụlọakụ ahụ ọnụ nke ndị nwe ụlọakụ ahụ anabataghị tupu e mee ụlọakụ ahụ nke mba."" This means Virgin Group made an offer to help during the mortgage crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na mgbakwunye, Virgin Group zụtara ụlọ ọrụ na-ahụ maka akụrụngwa nke Northern Rock.** The passage specifically states Virgin *did not* buy the bad bank part of Northern Rock (the mortgage asset side).
*   **B: The bank was bought by Virgin Group when it was nationalized.** The passage says the bank was *nationalized* (became owned by the government), not bought by Virgin Group.
*   **D: Mgbe emechara ụlọ akụ ahụ mba, Virgin Group nyere onyinye izizi ya maka ya.** The passage does not state Virgin Group's offer was accepted after nationalization. It was an offer *before* nationalization that was not taken up."
"Kedu obodo nke mbinye aka na nkwekọrịta ihu igwe Kyoto na-emetụta, dị ka e gosiri n'akụkụ a?","The correct answer is **A: Steeti America**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that after President Rudd's decision, the United States became ""the only developed nation not to support the agreement."" This directly identifies the U.S. as the country whose involvement with the Kyoto Protocol is being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: India:** The passage states India was *not* subject to the strict rules of the agreement.
*   **C: Australia:** While the passage mentions Australia previously refused to support Kyoto, it doesn't focus on their current status.
*   **D: Óbodo China:** Similar to India, China was not bound by the strict rules of the agreement.



"
Kedu ihe gọọmentị mbụ Australia tụrụ ụjọ na nkwado Kyoto ga-emebi?,"The correct answer is **B: Akụnụba obodo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isi ọchịchị na-achọghị mgbanwe nke gara aga nke mba Ọstrelia jụrụ ịkwado Kyoto, ha sị na ọ ga emebi **akụnụba obodo** n'ihi oke ndabere o nwere na mbupu coal n'obodo..."" This directly translates to the Australian government fearing that supporting Kyoto would damage the national economy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mba United States:** The US withdrew from the agreement, but the question asks about *Australia's* concerns.
*   **C: Mbupu coal:** Coal exports were the *reason* for the economic concern, not what they feared would be damaged.
*   **D: Iwu oke anwụrụ nke mba ahụ:** While the passage mentions that China and India weren’t subject to the same strict rules, it doesn't state that Australia was worried about its own strict rules."
Kedu mmemme ka ewetere ndị na-agba ụta n'ụzọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Mmemme maka ịchụ nta sitere na otu ndị na-agba ụta Sporting**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...in an arrangement between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, appropriately accredited volunteer staff were utilized, under the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.""  This directly identifies the program as a hunting program run *by* the Sporting Shooters Association.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmemme nke Sporting Shooters Association of Australia** - While true the program is *from* that association, it's specifically described as a *hunting* program.
* **B: Mmemme maka nchekwa na ihe nketa ogige** - The passage mentions conservation and heritage, but this isn't the name of the program the shooters are involved in.
* **C: Atụmatụ NPWS** - NPWS collaborated, but the program itself originated with the Sporting Shooters Association.



"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara nnwale mgbochi ahụhụ?,"The correct answer is **A: A nwalere mmemme ahụ naanị otu ugboro, yabụ na enyochaghị ya.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the rangers *closely monitored* the participants during a *trial* of the de-baiting program.** This implies it was a trial, suggesting it wasn't a one-time event and that evaluation was part of the process. The passage specifically highlights the careful monitoring and assessment of the trial's viability.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: E nyere ndị na-agba ụta ntụziaka na ọzụzụ:** The text says the accused poachers were ""given training"".
* **C: Ndị ọrụ Ranger bụ ndị na-ahụ maka ndị na-agba ụta:** The text states rangers ""closely monitored the accused poachers"".
* **D: Ndị agba ụta anọ a họọrọ:** The text confirms that ""four poachers were selected for the initial program"".



"
Ebee ka a chọtara nkewa ahụ dịka ederede ahụ si kọwaa?,"The correct answer is **B: N'ọkpụkpụ**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ma adabere n'ọkpụkpụ a..."" which translates to ""But based on the fossil..."". This clearly indicates the discovery (and therefore the split) was found *in* a fossil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'ime Rift Valley:** While the research service is *in* the Rift Valley, the split itself was found within the fossil.
*   **C: Banyere ihe akaebe molekul:** The passage doesn't mention molecular evidence.
*   **D: Njikọ nke Etiopia:** Ethiopia is the *location* of the research, not where the fossil was found.



"
"Gịnị mere tupu amụma, dị ka akụkụ nke?","The correct answer is **A: Nchọta fosil ahụ** (The fossil discovery).

Here's why:

The passage states that the split happened *before* what the fossil discovery suggested.  ""Ma adabere n'ọkpụkpụ a, ọputara na nkewa ahụ mere n'oge karịa ka ihe nchọpụta ahụrụ anya tụwara anya."" This directly implies that the fossil discovery was something that happened *after* the split, and that the split occurred earlier than the discovery initially indicated. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oge ezumike** (Leisure time) - This has no connection to the passage.
*   **C: nyocha nke data molekul** (Analysis of molecular data) - The passage doesn't mention molecular data.
*   **D: Ọmụmụ Rift Valley** (Rift Valley Study) - While the research service is *in* the Rift Valley, the passage isn't about the study itself, but what came *before* the fossil find *within* that study.

Kedu ihe onye ọkpụkpọ ga-eme iji chịkwaa mmegharị ahụ mgbe ọ na-egwu egwuregwu vidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ekwesịrị ịkwagharị onye njikwa ahụ kwụ ọtọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller ""would allow gamers to control actions and movements in video games by physically moving the device through the air."" This directly indicates that movement of the controller itself is how you control movement in the game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ebumnuche idowe sensọ onye njikwa nso na njikwa** - The passage doesn't mention needing to *aim* the sensors, just that they detect position.
*   **B: Triangle ebe onye ọ bụla nọ** - This is irrelevant to the controller's function.
*   **C: Wụnye sensọ n'akụkụ ihe onyonyo ha** - The sensors are *in* the controller, not something the player installs.



"
Kedu ihe emepụtara ka ọ yie ebe nchekwa Televison?,"The correct answer is **A: Ihe mmetụta njikwa abụọ ahụ** (The two sensors).

Here's why:

The passage states the controller ""yiri rimotu onyonyo"" (resembled a television remote) *because* it used two sensors to detect its orientation in space. The sensors are the reason for the similarity in design.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: onye njikwa maka Nintendo Revolution** (the controller for Nintendo Revolution) - This is what *is* being described, but not *why* it looks like a remote.
* **C: Adreesị isi okwu** (Address of the keynote) - Irrelevant to the design.
* **D: Sistemụ egwuregwu Nintendo Revolution** (Nintendo Revolution gaming system) - The system itself doesn't dictate the controller's appearance.



"
Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ akụkọ Xinhua kacha ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: A tụrụ ụgbọ elu ahụ egwu bọmbụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Ozi ndị ọzọ mechara bata kwuru na ụgbọ elu ahụ natara iyi ụjọ gbasara ogbunigwe ya mere o ji wee lọghachi Afganistan..."" This directly translates to ""Later reports said the plane received a bomb threat and therefore returned to Afghanistan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ dabara na Ürümqi:** The passage states the permit to land in Ürümqi was *cancelled*, not that it landed there.
*   **C: Afghanistan bụ ebe njem ụgbọ elu ahụ na-aga:** While it ended up in Afghanistan, the passage doesn't state it was the *intended* destination.
*   **D: Ọ dabara na Kandahar:** Kandahar is where it *landed* after returning, but not what the newer reports reveal.



"
Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ mbụ nke ụlọ ọrụ ọhụrụ Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: A tụrụ ụgbọ elu ahụ egwu bọmbụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ozi ndị ọzọ mechara bata kwuru na ụgbọ elu ahụ natara iyi ụjọ gbasara ogbunigwe ya mere o ji wee lọghachi Afganistan..."" This directly translates to ""Other reports later stated that the plane received a bomb threat, causing it to return to Afghanistan...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E weghaara ụgbọ elu ahụ (The plane was hijacked)** - The passage doesn’t mention hijacking.
* **B: A jụrụ ọdịda mmanye maka ụgbọ elu ahụ (Permission for the plane to land was denied)** - While the initial report mentions denial of landing permission, the *new* information adds the bomb threat detail.  The question asks what's *added* in the new reporting.
* **C: Ụgbọ elu ahụ laghachiri na Afghanistan ka e mechara njem (The plane returned to Afghanistan after completing a flight)** - It didn't complete a flight; it turned back.



"
Gịnị ka Sara Danius kwupụtara na ihe nkiri redio?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị otu ahụ ga-akwụsị ịgbalị ịkpọtụrụ Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sara Danius announced that they have ""given up trying to reach him"" (Bob Dylan). The quote """"Ugbu a anyị anaghị eme ihe ọbụla..."" directly translates to ""Now we are not doing anything"" - meaning they are ceasing their efforts to contact him.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye nwetara ihe nrite Nobel Literature** - While the announcement *concerned* the Nobel Literature laureate, Danius didn't announce *who* the laureate was, but rather their failed attempts to contact him.
*   **B: Ọ nweghị onye zara arịrịọ kọmitii ahụ maka ndị na-emekọ ihe ọnụ** - The passage doesn’t mention anyone responding to the committee.
*   **C: Nrite Nobel na 2016 na ndị asọmpi akwụkwọ** - The passage specifically focuses on the difficulties in contacting the winner, not the competition itself.



"
Onye na-enweghị ike ịchọta?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Nobel committee *gave up trying to reach* Bob Dylan. This means they couldn't find him or get a response. The rest of the options are either people who *were* able to make contact (Sara Danius's assistant) or groups not involved in the search itself (Swedish academics).

Therefore, the person who is unreachable is Bob Dylan.

"""Ònye kwuru na nkwa ahụ bụ """"isi nzọụkwụ""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states: ""Gọdọn Jọndro onye na-ekwuchitere Bush okwu kpọrọ nkwa Nọt Koria bụ """"nzọụkwụ dị oke mkpa na ịnweta mwepụ were anya nke ngwa agha nuklia ndị Koria."""""", which translates to ""Gordon Johndroe, Bush's press secretary, called the North Korean pledge a """"critical step in achieving the verifiable dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons programs."""""".

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who made the statement."
Sania mepụtara stampụ ole maka mba dị iche iche?,"The correct answer is **D: Karịrị 1,000**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O mepụtaara stampụ karịrị 1,000 maka Swidin na mba 28 ndị ọzọ.""  This translates to ""He designed more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Karịrị 2,000** - The passage only says *more than* 1,000, not more than 2,000.
*   **B: 1000** - The passage specifically states *more than* 1,000.
*   **C: ihe dị ka 2,000** -  Similar to A, this is an assumption not stated in the text.

"Kedu ihe nwere ike ịbụ ihe kpatara nkwụsị na-aga n'ihu site na ikuku tank, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Mgbatị okpomọkụ (Thermal expansion)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...ụmụ oghere ikuku tankị ahụ ka na-ehi ehi o nwere ike site na ebumibu n’ihi ekpomọkụ n’ime tankị ahụ"" which translates to ""...air vents from the tank were still venting as they could due to expansion from the heat inside the tank.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: The secondary containment compartment is completely full.** While the text mentions the secondary containment is used, it doesn’t link it to the continued venting of air.
*   **B: Usoro iwu ọkụ na-anwale ule nkịtị (Regular fire suppression system tests).** The text mentions a fire suppression system, but not that it's being tested.
*   **D: Ọkụ n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri dị na Fort Greely (Fire at the Fort Greely port).** The text only mentions a fire *following* the leak, not a separate fire at the port causing the venting.



"
Valve enyemaka meghere maka gịnị kpatara ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbasa ọkụ mere n'ime tankị**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ọkụ ọnyụnyụ sochitere nlekwa a na emechite anya n'ụlọ ihe gbasara ọkụ mere ka valvụ enyemaka mepee mmanụ..."" This directly links the opening of the relief valve to a fire in the pump house. The valve opened as a safety measure because of the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ike ahụ kwụsịrị na-eso ule usoro:** The text doesn't mention any power outage or testing procedure.
*   **C: Ụgbọ mmiri ndị ahụ jupụtara kpamkpam:** The text says the second tank was *not* filled.
*   **D: Enweghị gbọmgbọm zuru ezu iji mejuo mpaghara njide nke abụọ:** The text details a spill, implying there was plenty of oil. It doesn't state a lack of volume prevented filling a second containment area.



"
Kedu ka mmiri siri dị ugbu a na Ward nke itoolu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukwụ 20**.

The text states that Ward Itoolu experienced floodwaters ""as high as about twenty feet"" during Hurricane Katrina. This is the most direct answer to the question of how high the water was in Ward Itoolu."
"Na Ward nke itoolu, gịnị mere n'oge Hurricane Katrina?","The correct answer is **C: Iju mmiri nke dị ụkwụ 20 dị**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ward Itoolu, nke hụrụ oke ide mmiri ruru ihe dị ka feet iri abụọ n'oge Ajọ Ifufe Katrina..."" which translates to ""Ward Nine, experienced floodwaters as high as about twenty feet during Hurricane Katrina...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmiri idei mmiri dị 100 ụkwụ** - While the passage mentions a levee break with a 100-foot span, it doesn't say the water was 100 feet *high* in Ward Nine.
* **B: E ji mmiri dị n'úkwù kpuchie levee ahụ** - The passage doesn’t state the levee was covered by water, only that water *passed over* the levee.
* **D: E ji sentimita 6 nke mmiri ozuzo kụjie levee ahụ mebiri emebi** - The passage mentions a 6-inch (not centimeter) water flow through a *broken* levee, but doesn't state this happened specifically in Ward Nine. Also, it describes flow *through* a break, not damage *to* the levee.



"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ ụgha ka Hamilton siri kwuo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ebe njem onye ọrịa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the patient *traveled from Nigeria*, where there have been some cases of Ebola. However, the question asks what Hamilton said. The passage does **not** state where Hamilton said the patient traveled from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ihe ize ndụ na ndị ọrịa ndị ọzọ ga-ebute ọrịa ahụ** – The passage confirms the risk of further transmission by mentioning the hospital isolating the patient.
*   **C: Ma esorola usoro iwu ziri ezi** – The passage explicitly states the hospital *has followed protocols* for infectious disease control.
*   **D: Ahụ ike nke onye ọrịa ugbu a** – The passage states the patient was admitted in *stable condition*."
Gịnị bụ ihe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị na-agbalị ịghọta?,"The correct answer is **D: Olee otú Ụwa si malite** (How Earth started).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scientists are hoping to understand ""ka uwa dị iche iche sị kpụọ, ọkachasị otu ụwa anyị siri kpụọ"" (how different planets formed, especially how *our* planet formed). This directly relates to the origin of Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'oge ahụ, ndị comet tụrụ ụwa** (When comets hit the earth) - While comets are mentioned, the passage isn't focused on *when* they hit Earth, but rather their potential role in delivering water.
*   **B: Kedu ka esi eme protein** (How to make protein) - The passage mentions proteins, but only in the context of life potentially forming, it doesn't focus on the *process* of protein creation.
*   **C: Na-akọwapụta ihe ndị dị ndụ** (Describing living things) - The passage mentions life, but the core question for scientists is about the planet's formation, not defining life itself.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""and the assistance of 80 police officers present to direct motorists to alternate routes."" This directly indicates the police officers were involved in guiding drivers around the closed route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha rịọrọ ka ndị FBI mechaa mmechi ahụ:** The passage states the closure was *with* FBI support, not that the police *requested* the FBI to complete it.
*   **B: Ha họọrọ ime mmechi ahụ:** The passage says the closure was done by Maryland transportation officials, not specifically the police.
*   **D: Ha kwuru na igbu oge na okporo ụzọ na ụzọ ọzọ:** The passage says there were no reports of traffic fatalities, not that police made this claim.



"
Kedu ka mmechi ahụ siri metụta ụzọ mbata tube?,"The correct answer is **A: E debere ha iche**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**E jiri ụmụ wongworo mkpofu igbochi ụmụ mbata tuubu**"" which translates to ""**Barricades of concrete were used to block the tube entrances**"". This clearly indicates the tube entrances were blocked, meaning they were made inaccessible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ha jere ozi dị ka ntụgharị uche** (They served as a distraction) - The passage doesn't suggest the entrances were used as a distraction.
*   **C: Ndị ọkwọ ụgbọala nwere ike ịnweta ha** (Drivers could access them) - This is the opposite of what the passage states; they were *blocked*.
*   **D: A kwadoro okporo ụzọ ruo ọtụtụ kilomita tupu mgbe ahụ** (The road was supported for many kilometers beforehand) - This is irrelevant to the tube entrances.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...and nwaa ị see fòto nkwụsị ndị uwe ojii tupu ya agafee okporo ụzọ wee gaa n'ihu, na-akpali onye uwe ojii Njeghari ilekota Nnukwu okporo ụzọ anya nke California na-eduzi okporo ụzọ iji nyeghachi ya iwu gafeghachị , ugboro abụọ.""  This means the Highway Patrol *initially* allowed the photographer to cross the highway, then told him to go back.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage does say the photographer stopped his car on Sepulveda Boulevard, but that happened *before* the interaction with the Highway Patrol.
*   **C:** While the photographer took pictures of the police stop, it wasn't something that *didn't* happen before the accident; it was a step in the sequence of events.
*   **D:** The passage mentions Bieber's statement but doesn’t say the photographer was successful in getting Bieber's attention.

"Tupu ụgbọ ala akụọ ya, gịnị ka onye na-ese foto na-agbalị imezu?","The correct answer is **B: Weghara onyonyo nkwụsị ndị uwe ojii**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịdọba ụgbọala na Sepulveda Boulevard** - He *had* stopped, but that wasn't what he was actively trying to do immediately before being hit.
*   **C: Gafee nnukwu okporo ụzọ** - He attempted this *after* taking the photos, not before.
*   **D: Mee ka onye uwe ojii kwe ka ọ nọgide na-agbapụ** - There's no mention of him trying to get permission from the police.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ọnọdụ ahụike onyeisiala adịla mma, mana ọ ka ga-anọpụ anọpụ ruo ọtụtụ abalị."" This directly translates to ""The President's health condition is good, but he will still remain isolated for several nights.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ahụ adịghị ya mma** - The text says his health *is* good.
*   **B: Akpịrị ya na-afụ ụfụ** - The text doesn't mention any breathing problems.

* The text states: ""Ewepu ahuoku na akpiri n’egbu m mgbu, ahu di m enwere m ike iru oru site na telecommuting."" This directly translates to ""Despite the pain and discomfort, I can work from home (telecommuting).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Okpomọkụ ya adịghị ebuli elu:** The text doesn't mention anything about a fever.
* **B: Ruo ọtụtụ izu, ọ ga-anọ n'ụlọ:** The text says ""ruo ọtụtụ abalị"" (for several nights), not weeks.
* **D: O bu nje virus ahụ nke ukwuu:** The text states he *has* the illness (""Onye Ozi NKe Onye Isi Ala Rodrigo Arias kwuru. Ọnọdụ ahụike onyeisiala adịla mma, mana ọ ka ga-anọpụ anọpụ ruo ọtụtụ abalị.""), but doesn't describe the severity of the virus.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ka ọ na-erule mbido taa, ikuku dị ihe dịka 83km/awa, ma a na-atụkwa anya na ọ ga-eme ka ọ na-agbada."" This means the cyclone is *expected to intensify* (become stronger) *before* reaching its peak strength (240 km/h).  ""N'ihu eru elu ya"" translates to ""Before reaching its peak"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tupu erute na Maldives:** The passage doesn’t indicate a timeframe relative to its arrival in the Maldives.
*   **B: Mgbe ọsọ ifufe gbadara ruo 83 kph:** The passage specifically states it’s expected to *increase* in strength *from* 83 kph.
*   **D: tupu ọbịbịa nke ifufe 149 mph:** The passage indicates its speed is *increasing* to 149 mph, not that it will intensify *before* that speed.



"
"Mgbe Tropical Cyclone Gonu kachasi ike, kedu ka ifufe siri were ọsọ ọsọ?","The correct answer is **B: 240 kilomita kwa elekere**.

The text states: ""Na nkacha elu ya, Ajọ ifufe Ebe okpomọkụ Gonu... rutere ifufe nọgidesịrị ike nke kilomita 240 kwa awa (maịlị 149 kwa awa).""  This directly answers the question about the highest wind speed.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a tozuru oke dị ka njirimara Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: Algae nke otu ụdị**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ihe n’ebute taid n’acha uhie uhie bu oke Karenia brevis, otu single-celled organism n’agba na mmiri."" This translates to ""The cause of red tide is Karenia brevis, a single-celled organism in the water."" This identifies it as a type of algae.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O nwere ike ime ka akwara ndị mmadụ ghara ịrụ ọrụ:** While the passage says it *produces toxins that can affect nerves*, this is a *result* of being Karenia brevis, not a defining characteristic of what it *is*.
* **C: Ọ nwere ọtụtụ sel:** The passage states it's *single-celled*.
* **D: Nke a na-eme ndammana:** The passage does not suggest it mimics anything.

Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a Karena Brevis na-enweghị ike ime?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-abawanye nke ọma na ọnụọgụ n'ọnọdụ ọ bụla**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** *“Ihe okike nwere ike ịgbagha onwe ha iweta maka ezigbo ọnọdụ, nke ga eme ka nje a bụ alge mụbaa n'ụzọ dị egwu.”* This means *Karenia brevis* doesn't grow well in *all* conditions, only in *favorable* ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Enwere ike inwe nkwarụ akwara azụ:** The passage clearly states the algae produces toxins that can harm/kill fish.
* **C: mmetụta mmiri:**  The passage states the toxins contaminate water.
* **D: imepụta neurotoxic:** The passage says the algae produces neurotoxins (""nsi nke akwara ozi"").

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emeghị n'ihi Hurricane Felicia, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: Ide mmiri n'okporo ụzọ** (Flooding on roads).

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""enwebeghị mkpesa ide mmiri m'ọbụ mmebi ihe"" which translates to ""there were no reports of flooding or damage"". This means flooding did *not* occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mma mmiri ozuzo** (Rainfall) - The passage explicitly states ""butere maka mmiri ozizo n'ọtụtụ isuo"" (caused rainfall in many areas).
*   **B: égbè eluigwe na-eso mmiri ozuzo** (Thunderstorms with rainfall) - The passage states ""Ụfọdụ mmiri ozuzo ahụ bụ nke égbè eluigwe na àmụmà ugboro ugboro sonyere"" (Some of the rainfall was accompanied by frequent thunderstorms).
*   **C: àmụmà na-adịgide adịgide** (Persistent thunderstorms) - The passage states thunderstorms were *frequent* with the rain, but doesn't say they were *persistent*.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara ajọ ifufe Felicia?,"The correct answer is **A: Oahu ritere uru na mmiri ozuzo sochirinụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ekowara ugwu ahụ, ruru sentimita 6.34 na inchi n’ogologo na Oahu, dịka akọwara dịka ‘ihe bara uru’."" This translates to ""The mountain received 6.34 centimeters (inches) of rain on Oahu, described as 'beneficial'"".
* The phrase ""ihe bara uru"" (beneficial) implies that the rain *was* helpful, not that Oahu benefited *from* the storm's aftermath. The passage specifically mentions no damage and the rain was considered positive.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B:** The passage says Felicia ""bu bu oke ifufe nke udi 4"" (was a Category 4 hurricane) and ""dara buruzia obere ifufe nke ana akpo tropikal depression"" (weakened to a tropical depression).
* **C:** ""Butere maka mmiri ozizo n'ọtụtụ isuo"" (caused flooding in many islands) confirms this.
* **D:** ""Ụfọdụ mmiri ozuzo ahụ bụ nke égbè eluigwe na àmụ̀mà ugboro ugboro sonyere"" (Some of the rainfall was associated with frequent thunderstorms) confirms this.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kọwara nke ọma ka 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix si kwụsị?,"The correct answer is **C: Mgbe nke ahụ gasịrị, a hapụrụ Piquet Jr**.

Here's why:

* The passage states directly: ""Piquet Jr. was dropped after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso merụrụ ahụ n'ihe mgbakọ** - The passage doesn't mention Alonso being injured.
* **B: Piquet Jr. meriri** - The passage states he *caused* a safety car situation that *allowed* Alonso to win, but Piquet Jr. didn't win.
* **D: Enwere nsogbu na ụgbọ ala nchekwa** - The passage mentions a safety car being deployed, but doesn't state there were *problems* with it.



"
Kedu oge ihe mberede a mere?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe Alonso kwụsịrị olulu ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states Piquet Jr. crashed ""ozugbo o mechara nkwụsị obere oge maka Fernando Alonso"" – meaning *immediately after* Alonso had a brief stop. This is the direct trigger for Piquet Jr.'s crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ebe ụgbọ ala ndị ọzọ gbanyere mmanụ** – While refueling is mentioned, it's a consequence of the situation, not the timing of the crash.
*   **C: Tupu ụgbọ mberede ahụ erute** – This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **D: Piquet wee banye n'ọdụ mmanụ ụgbọala** – Piquet Jr. crashed *before* going to the pit lane.

This directly means the *formation of a new species* (mmepe nke ụdị) was found to happen in a shorter timeframe than previously believed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ozi gbasara ụdị:** The passage doesn't discuss the speed of *learning about* species.
*   **C: mmemme ozuzu n'etiti ọtụtụ ụdị:** The passage refers to changes within *a single* species (Darwin's finches) that led to a new species, not interaction *between* many species.
*   **D: ụdị 'na-aga n'ihu n'oge:** This is a vague statement that doesn't align with the specific finding described in the passage.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ndị nchọpụta na-akọghị?,"The correct answer is **C: Kedu aha ụdị ọhụrụ ahụ bụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the discovery of a *new species* of finch.** It describes *how* it emerged (hybridization of two existing species) but **doesn't actually tell us what the new species is *called*.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ebe ụdị akwụkwọ akụkọ si malite** - The passage says it was published in the journal *Science*.
* **B: Ogologo oge ole ka usoro evolushọn ahụ were** - The passage *does* address this, stating the evolution happened in just two generations, which is surprisingly fast.
* **D: Nnụnụ ndị ahụ na-ekere òkè n'ịzụ** - The passage doesn’t mention anything about the finches' diet.



"
Ebee ka a ga-enwe CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Na Bucharest**.

The passage specifically states that Bucharest will be the first city in South-Eastern Europe to host CowParade. The other options are too broad or inaccurate based on the provided text."

* **The passage directly states:** ""...mmeme KawụParedị, mmeme nka ọha kachasị ukwu n'ụwa n'ile, n'etiti ọnwa Juunu na Ọgọstụ nke afọ a."" This confirms it's a summer art event happening across Southeastern Europe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ""Ọ na-eme naanị n'ebe e chere na ọ bụ """"ihe okike” ""** - The passage says Bucharest *aims* to be seen as creative, but doesn't say CowParade only happens in creative cities.
* **B: Ụlọ Nzukọ Obodo Bucharest chepụtara ya** - The passage doesn't mention who created CowParade, only that Bucharest is hosting it.
* **D: Ihe ngosi nka ọha kacha ukwuu emere n'ebe ahụ** - While true, option C provides a more complete and accurate description of what CowParade *is*.



"
Gịnị kpaliri mkpebi Russia ịkwụsị iji II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Ihe ọghọm (Accidents)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Il-76 has had ""serious crashes in Russia recently"" and that Russia grounded the planes ""following the incident."" This directly links the grounding to accidents/incidents, not war, the military, or inconclusive investigations.



"
II-76: Gịnị ka ọ bụ?,"The correct answer is **C: ụgbọ elu** (airplane).

The text clearly states ""Il-76 bụ ngalaba gbapụtara ihe nke ndị agha Rọshịa na Sọviyetị... ma hụkwalarị ihe mberede siri oke ike na mba Rọshịa."" This translates to ""Il-76 is an air division of the Russian and Soviet military... and has also seen major accidents in Russia."" This indicates it's a type of aircraft.



"
Onye goro ndị ọrụ na-ede akwụkwọ Simpson?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The text states: ""In 1989 he helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he was responsible for hiring the show’s original team of writers.""  ""He"" refers to Simon. Therefore, Simon was the one who hired the writers."
"Onye na-ezigara ya ozi agbamume, ka Fluke siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: Enwere ma nwoke ma nwanyị** (There were both men and women).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Fluke received ""ọtụtụ okwu nkwado o nwetara n'aka ụmụnwoke ma ụmụnwaanyị"" (a lot of support from men and women). This means the messages came from both genders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye ahụike** (The health professional) - The passage doesn't specify *who* sent the messages, only that they were supportive.
*   **B: Ndị na-akwado ahụike ụmụ nwanyị** (Supporters of women's health) - While the supporters likely care about women's health, the passage states the support came from both men and women, not just a specific group.
*   **C: Ụdị nwoke** (Type of man) - The passage clearly states that women also sent supportive messages.



"
"Gịnị ka ụfọdụ ndị na-achọghị ka ndị inyom na-ekwu banyere ya, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị mmadụ bụ ụmụ nwoke** (People are men).

Here's why:

The passage states the decision to silence women was made *because of support from men and women who believe contraception is acceptable*. This implies the opposition to women speaking out comes from people, specifically men, who support that viewpoint. The context points to those in support of controlling women's reproductive choices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ego mmefu ahụike (Healthcare costs):** While healthcare costs can be a factor in discussions about contraception, the passage doesn't directly link the silencing of women to financial concerns.
*   **C: ọdịmma ụmụ nwanyị (Women's wellbeing):** The act of silencing women *harms* their wellbeing, it doesn't stem *from* concern for it.
*   **D: ohere (Opportunity):** The passage doesn't mention opportunity.

"Kedu mbara ala kachasị ndụ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ụwa (Earth)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka anyị madebere, sọ otu ụwa na-egosi ọtụtụ ike karịa Taịtan, ma aha ya bụ Earth"""" (Let's agree, say one world shows more power than Titan, and its name is Earth"").  This directly answers the question of which planet is described as the most powerful/alive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Onye nwere nnukwu ike, ọgụgụ isi, ma ọ bụ mkpa (Someone with great power, intelligence, or need)** - This is a descriptive phrase, not a planet.
* **C: Sistemu anyanwụ (Solar System)** - The passage focuses on a single planet, not the entire solar system.
* **D: Saturn** - The passage specifically *compares* Earth to Titan, implying Earth is more powerful, not Saturn.



"
Kedu ụwa a chọtara nke nwere osimiri na ọdọ mmiri ndị nwere mmiri mmiri na-agafe agafe?,"The correct answer is **C: Sistemu anyanwụ** (Solar System).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Earth.** The passage details a planet with water, rivers flowing from it, and the ability to see rocks or sand at the bottom when you fall into the water. It then explicitly states this planet is called Earth and is more powerful than Titan.
* **Earth is part of the Solar System.**  The context of discovering a planet *within* the Solar System is implied.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Jupiter:** Jupiter is a gas giant, not a rocky planet with visible oceans and riverbeds.
    * **B: Onye nwere nnukwu ike, ọgụgụ isi, ma ọ bụ mkpa (Someone with great strength, intelligence, or need):** This is a description of a *being*, not a planet.
    * **D: Saturn:** Saturn, like Jupiter, is a gas giant.

Therefore, the passage is describing the discovery of Earth *within* our Solar System.

Kedu n'ime nchọpụta ndị a na-enweghị njikọ na ịchọta nku?,"The correct answer is **D: na-egosi na ihe ka ọtụtụ n'ime dinosaur nwere ábụbà**.

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on the discovery and analysis of feathers.** It details their color, structure (barbs, barbules, rachis), function (display/thermoregulation, not flight), and evolutionary origins.

Let's look at why the other options are related to the feather discovery:

* **A: The hue of the animal:** The passage specifically mentions the dinosaur had reddish hues on top and carotenoid colors underneath, detailing the feather's color.
* **B: Knowing it wasn’t operated for flight:** The passage contrasts the structure of these feathers to that of modern flying birds, establishing that they were likely for display or thermoregulation.
* **C: Understanding the origin of feathers:** A key finding is the explanation of how feathers might have evolved from barb and barbule structures.

Option D, while mentioned as a separate discovery (""Nke a na-egosi na, opekata mpe, ụfọdụ daịnosọọ nwere abụba""), isn't directly related to the *feather* discovery itself. It's a separate piece of information found alongside the feathers, but it doesn’t help understand the feathers’ structure, origin, or function.



"
Kedu ihe enweghị nku nke dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: A rachis**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""The fossil lacked a fully developed central shaft, known as a rachis, but it had other features that feathers possess – like barbs and barbules."" This directly tells us the fossilized feathers *did not* have a rachis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: filament nkeji nke na-apụta site na barb nke nku** - The passage mentions barbs and barbules *were* present.
*   **C: okenye feathers** - The passage suggests the feathers were not fully developed adult feathers.
*   **D: agba agba n'okpuru** - The passage says the animal had pigmentation (color), and specifically mentions carotenoid colors below the surface.

Kedu n'ime nkọwa ndị a nke ZMapp bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụ ezie na ọ nwere ike ịgwọ ọrịa ndị dị ugbu a, ọ pụghị ịkwụsị ọnwụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""ruo ugbu a, enwebeghi ọgwụ ọbụla gosiri hooha na o nwere ike ịgwọ onye bu ọrịa a"" (so far, no drug has been shown to be effective at curing anyone with the disease). It also says ZMapp ""ọbaghị uru na-igbochi ọnwụ ka esiri chee"" (does not appear to be as beneficial in preventing death as previously thought). Therefore, the statement that it can treat the disease is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Enwere ọgwụ mgbochi na ya** - The passage states ZMapp is an antibody, so it *is* a type of preventative medicine.
*   **C: Ejiri ya na nyocha PALM dịka njikwa** - The text directly says: “Ejiri ZMapp mere ihe nruba ama, nke a putara na ndi sayentist jiri ya mee baseline tunyere ogwugwo ato ozo” (ZMapp was used as a baseline against three other drugs).
*   **D: Nnyocha ndị e mere na-egosi na uru ya adịchaghị ukwuu dị ka e kweere na mbụ** - The passage confirms this: ""achọpụtara na ọbaghị uru na-igbochi ọnwụ ka esiri chee"" (it doesn't appear to be as beneficial as previously thought).



"
Kedu otu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a kpọtụrụ aha kacha mma chịkọta nnwale PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp rụrụ ọrụ dị ka mmalite ikpe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Na nnwale PALM, eji ZMapp mere ihe nruba ama, nke a putara na ndi sayentist jiri ya mee baseline tunyere ogwugwo ato ozo."" This means ZMapp was used as a starting point for comparison with other drugs - essentially, a control or baseline.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dị ka ọmụmụ ihe si kwuo, enwere ike ịnwe uru karịa ka ekwenyere na mbụ** - While this *might* be true based on the study, the passage doesn't specifically state this as a summary of the PALM trial itself.
*   **B: Usoro ọgwụgwọ atọ, gụnyere ZMapp, dị iche na ọgwụ njikwa** -  The passage mentions three drugs *were tested against* ZMapp, but doesn't focus on their differences from a control.
*   **D: E gosiputara na ọ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma n'ijikwa ọnọdụ ndị dị adị** - The passage states that ZMapp did *not* ultimately prove to be as effective as initially hoped.



"
Ebe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị kwenyere na mgbawa ọhụrụ ahụ ga-enwe mmetụta kasịnụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mba ndị na-emepe emepe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the new diagnostic tool could ""bring early detection to diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV to people in developing countries."" This directly points to developing nations being where the impact will be greatest due to limited access to existing diagnostic resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mba ndị bara ọgaranya:** The passage contrasts the potential impact, noting cancer survival rates are *half* as good in wealthier nations, implying the tool will be more impactful where resources are lacking.
*   **C: N'ime United States:** While Stanford is in the US, the passage focuses on the broader global impact, particularly in resource-limited settings.
*   **D: Mahadum Stanford:** Stanford developed the technology, but the question asks where the *impact* will be greatest, not where the invention came from.



"
Kedu otu a ga-esi wuo ngwaọrụ nyocha?,"The correct answer is **B: ndị na-ebi akwụkwọ inkjet nkịtị**.

Here's why:

The passage states the device is ""ọtu mpekere ngwa nka nke enwere ike iruputa site na iji inkjeti igwe-prita din mma"" (a small device that can be fabricated using ordinary inkjet printers). This directly points to standard inkjet printers being used to create the diagnostic tool.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Otu dollar nke ọ bụla (One dollar each)** - While the cost is mentioned as one US cent, this isn't *how* it's built. It's the *cost* of production.
*   **C: Chips ndị na-ebipụta (Printing chips)** - While chips may be *part* of the device, the key fabrication method described is inkjet printing.
*   **D: ngwa nyocha ọzọ (Another diagnostic device)** - This doesn't answer how the device is *made*.

"Kedu n'ime okwu ndị na-esonụ gbasara scarps lobate bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: N'elu ọnwa, ọ bụghị ọtụtụ n'ime ha** (On the moon, not many of them exist).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Skap ndị a ka achọpụtara gburugburu ọnwa..."" (These scarps have been discovered *around* the moon) This implies they *do* exist on the moon, and aren't scarce.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: O yikarịrị ka ha sitere na ihe ndị mere na mbụ** (They are likely derived from earlier events) - The passage suggests they are the result of the moon slowly accumulating material.
* **B: Ha gosipụtara na ọrụ geologic dị na ọnwa** (They indicate geologic activity on the moon) -  The discovery of these scarps contradicts the idea that there has been no geologic activity.
* **C: Ha nwere ike pụta n'ihi na ọnwa na-adị ntakịrị** (They may have formed because the moon shrinks slightly) - The passage says they formed from the moon slowly accumulating material, which could be related to slight shrinking.



"
Kedu nkọwa nke ọdịdị ala na-akwado nkwuputa nke akụkụ ahụ na ọnwa na-enwe ọrụ geologic?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogologo oge gara aga, a rụrụ ala ndị ahụ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the lobate scarps likely formed from the moon slowly accumulating material.** This implies geologic activity over a *long period* of time, as opposed to a single, recent event.  Building up features like that takes time.
* **The passage specifically contrasts this finding with the idea that there's been *no* geologic activity on the moon.** If these scarps formed slowly, it proves geologic processes *have* been occurring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọnwa na-eji nke nta nke nta na-adị ntakịrị** (The moon is slowly shrinking) – While lunar shrinkage *is* a factor sometimes connected to these scarps, it's not the core explanation presented in the passage. The accumulation of material is more emphasized.
* **C: N'elu ọnwa nwere ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke atụmatụ ndị a** (There are a small number of these features on the moon's surface) – The *number* of scarps doesn’t indicate geologic activity; their *formation* does.
* **D: Ọ bụ naanị n'oge na-adịbeghị anya ka arụrụ ala ahụ** (The land was formed recently) – The passage implies a *slow* accumulation, not a recent one.

"Kedu ihe na-agaghị aga n'ihu ruo mgbe ebubo ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Akwụkwọ akụkọ foto** (Publication of photos).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ụlọ ọrụ Krawn, nke nọ n'isi amamikpe, agwala ndị nta akụkọ na ha agaghị ekwu okwu gbasara okwu akpụ n'ọnụ ozo ruo mgbe amara mmadụ ikpe."" This translates to: ""The Crown Office, which heads prosecution, has told reporters they will not speak about the case further until the person is found guilty.""

The context leading up to this statement focuses on the potential for prejudice caused by publishing photos of the accused. Therefore, the thing that won't proceed until a verdict is reached is further discussion, *specifically including the publication of photos.*

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Okwu agbakwunyere** (Additional statements) - The passage doesn’t mention any restrictions on additional statements generally, only on speaking about the case.
*   **C: Na-ekwu maka akaebe nke ndị akaebe anya** (Discussing witness testimony) - While witness testimony is part of a trial, the passage doesn’t state it’s restricted.
*   **D: Mbipụta nke akụkọ** (Publication of stories) - While photo publication is specifically restricted, the passage doesn’t say *all* stories are banned. Just discussion of the case in detail.



"
Kedu ihe akụkụ ahụ edepụtaghị dị ka mbipụta dị ugbu a maka ndị na-edochi anya?,"The correct answer is **A: Oké njọ ihu igwe**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ọnọdụ ihu igwe dị egwu"" (terrible weather conditions) as a factor making the situation bad and hindering rescue efforts. The passage does *not* explicitly state any details about the amount of ice (ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ice or oke nke ice) or that the ice is broken up (ice agbaze). 

Therefore, ""Oké njọ ihu igwe"" is the aspect of the situation that wasn't detailed in the provided text.



"
Kedu ihe ọzọ na-egbochi ọrụ nnapụta ma e wezụga ice?,"The correct answer is **B: Burugburu ebe obibi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tinyere mmiri oyi siri ike, **ọnọdụ ihu igwe dị egwu** na egbochi mgbalị nzọpụta."" (In addition to the strong icy water, **dangerous weather conditions** hampered rescue efforts.)

This directly identifies dangerous weather as an additional obstacle to rescue, alongside the ice. ""Burugburu ebe obibi"" translates to ""environment/surroundings"" and encompasses dangerous weather conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Enweghi ihe onwunwe** (Lack of property) - The passage doesn't mention anything about lack of supplies.
*   **C: Enweghị enyemaka** (Lack of help) - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ndị sealers** (Sealers) - Irrelevant to the context."
Kedu echiche Roberts akwadoghị?,"The correct answer is **D: Nzuzo dị ka ikike** (Privacy as a right).

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts ""disagreed with the explicit right to privacy upon which the Roe decision was based."" He believes the Roe decision relied on a flawed understanding of privacy as a constitutional right.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Omume nke nyocha ikpe** (The practice of judicial review) - Roberts *did* acknowledge the importance of the Supreme Court being able to overturn its own precedents (like Roe v. Wade), which is part of the judicial review process.
*   **B: Ihe mere o ji dị mkpa ịgbaso mkpebi Ụlọikpe Kasị Elu** (The importance of following Supreme Court decisions) - While he wants to overturn Roe, he acknowledges the importance of the *ability* for the Supreme Court to change/overturn its decisions.
*   **C: Nke mbụ nke ndụ** (The sanctity of life) - He refers to Roe v. Wade as ""a badly reasoned decision,"" implying a belief in the value of life, even if he doesn't explicitly state it.



"
Roberts chere na isiokwu ahụ bụ omume rụrụ arụ nke na-agaghị atụle?,"The correct answer is **C: ikike nzuzo nzuzo**.

Here's why:

The passage states Roberts believed the constitutional basis for *Roe v. Wade* relied on a ""right to privacy."" He specifically questioned the validity of that right as a basis for the decision. He didn't dismiss the *topic* as morally wrong, but rather challenged the *legal justification* used in the ruling. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkwekọrịta nke mkpebi Ụlọikpe Kasị Elu (Agreement of Supreme Court decision)** - The passage indicates Roberts *disagreed* with the basis of the decision, not that he agreed with it.
*   **B: ikpe na Roe v. Wade (The case in Roe v. Wade)** - While he talks about *Roe v. Wade*, he doesn't say the case itself should not be considered. His objection is to its reasoning.
*   **D: Nkọwa nke ikpe (Explanation of the case)** - He provides some explanation, but his primary concern isn't simply understanding the case, it's challenging the grounds on which it was decided.



"
Ebee ka ọkụ abụọ ahụ na-atụ aka?,"The correct answer is **C: Na ebumnuche ụgbọ elu mbụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""E dochiri ụzọ abụọ dị ọkụ iji rụtụrụ mbara igwe n'otu abalị."" which translates to ""Two fiery paths were used to reach the sky in one night."" And also states ""na-aka akara kpọmkwem ogenta ahụ ụgbọelu nke mbụ gbara na nzube ya,"" meaning ""aimed exactly at the target of the first aircraft"". Therefore, the fiery paths/flames are aimed at the first aircraft's destination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-arịgo elu** - While the paths might go up, the passage focuses on *where* they are aimed.
*   **B: Site na nsọtụ obodo** - The passage doesn't say the fires originated from the edge of town.
*   **D: N'ime ogige ncheta, n'etiti** - The memorial park is mentioned as being built *between* things, not as the target of the fires.



"
"Kedu mgbe a na-arụ ụlọ elu ọhụrụ dị n'ebe ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **D: Owuwu ka na-aga n'ihu**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Owuwu ụlọ ruru igwe ise na-aga n'ihu n'ebe ọrụ..."" which translates to ""The construction of five-story buildings is ongoing at the site..."". This directly indicates that the construction is still in progress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'oge etiti ehihie (Mid-afternoon)** - The passage doesn't mention any construction happening in the mid-afternoon.
*   **B: 8:46 nke ụtụtụ (8:46 AM)** - This is the time the dust fell, not when construction is happening.
*   **C: N'ime oge nke otu abalị (Within the span of one night)** - This refers to repairing the roads, not the building construction.



"
Kedu ihe akaebe na-egosi ọdịdị ọgba nke ụmụnna nwanyị asaa ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbanwe na okpomọkụ**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Akụkụ nke ọnụ ụzọ ọgba** - While the passage mentions the size (100-250 meters diameter), size alone isn't proof of pits.
*   **C: Nyocha nke geological** - The passage doesn't mention any geological surveys or analysis.
*   **D: Ihe oyiyi nke ọgba aghara ụwa** - The passage doesn't mention images of impact craters on Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nnukwu oghere ala** - The passage talks about the pits, but doesn't state they were discovered by looking for large openings.
*   **C: Akụkụ nke ọgba** - While the passage suggests they *are* pits, it doesn’t say this is how their thermal characteristics were identified.
*   **D: Nnyocha n'ime ọgba ụwa** - The passage doesn’t mention any investigation *inside* Earth’s pits.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndị isi amatabeghi aha ya, mana ha ma na ọ bụ onye otu agbụrụ Uigọọ."" This translates to ""The authorities do not know his name, but they know he is of Uyghur ethnicity.""  The key phrase is ""amatabeghi aha ya"" (do not know his name). This implies they don't have full, concrete knowledge of his identity, including definitively knowing his ethnicity beyond just that he is Uyghur.  The statement that they know his ethnicity *well* is therefore not entirely true, as the text only states they know *that* he is Uyghur.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true according to the passage:

*   **A: Ọ were ụgbọ ala na mwakpo ahụ** (He used a vehicle in the attack) - The text explicitly says ""Nwoke ahụ kwọrọ n'ebubo ụgbọ ala nwere ụkwụ atọ"" (The man was accused of driving a three-wheeled vehicle).
*   **B: E boro ya ebubo na ọ tọwara ihe mgbawa** (He was accused of throwing an explosive) - The text states ""eji ihe mgbawa gasị jikere kwaba n'ime igwe mmadụ"" (using an explosive device ready to throw into a crowd).
*   **D: O merụrụ ahụ** (He was injured) - The text says ""ka omerụchara ahụ n'ihi mgbari ogbunigwe ahụ"" (as he sustained injuries due to the explosion).



"
Ndị ọchịchị kwadoro kedu nkọwa gbasara mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Nzụlite agbụrụ nke onye a na-enyo enyo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndị isi amatabeghi aha ya, mana ha ma na ọ bụ onye otu agbụrụ Uigọọ."" (The authorities do not know his name, but they know he is of Uyghur ethnicity.) This is the detail the authorities *have* confirmed about the attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aha ndị ọ bụla so** - The passage states they *don't* know his name.
*   **C: Ebumnuche kpatara mwakpo ahụ** - The passage doesn't mention the motive for the attack.
*   **D: Aha onye a na-enyo enyo, ma nke mbụ na nke ikpeazụ** - Again, the passage says his name is unknown.

This means the spacecraft *continued to have problems with attitude control* (maintaining its correct position in space) **despite** the gyroscope functioning and commands being sent.  Thrusters are used for attitude control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na-echekwa gyroscope (Maintaining the gyroscope):** The text says the gyroscope *was* functioning, not that it was a problem.
* **C: Mmalite jet (Jet ignition):**  The text doesn’t mention any problems with jets igniting.
* **D: Na-alaghachi na omume mgbe niile (Returning to operation repeatedly):** While the station *did* restart, the text implies it was a response to the initial attitude control problem, not a repeated issue itself.

Here's why:

The passage states the attitude control system (""ọdụ ụgbọ nọ n’eluụwa"") ""continued to malfunction"" (""nọgidere na-akpa àgwà"") despite the gyroscope and attitude messages. This indicates its *function* was to control attitude, but it was *malfunctioning* while attempting to do so.  ""Na-aga n'ihu na-eme mgbanwe"" (continuing to malfunction) best reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ahụrụ gyroscope furu efu.** The passage mentions the gyroscope, but it doesn't state that the *function* of the station was to find a lost gyroscope.
*   **C: Imecha njem mbara igwe.** The passage describes a problem *during* the spacewalk, not its completion.
*   **D: Na-agbanye ụgbọ elu.** The passage mentions the station being activated by the Russian ground team, but that's not the *function* of the attitude control system itself.

The passage states the trial took place in **Virginia**. It *does not* say it took place in the state where AOL is based.  The other statements are all supported by the text:

*   **B: E nwere ikpe** - The passage states someone *was* convicted.
*   **C: Ikpe ahụ nwetara uru nke iwu gbasara email spam** - The passage specifically states the conviction was the first using a 2003 law to fight spam.
*   **D: AOL nọ na-eche ebubo** - The passage says AOL brought the complaints and thus was the plaintiff (the one *making* the accusation).

Therefore, option A is the only statement that isn't supported by the given text."

"Gịnị ka ala ọma jijiji ahụ kpatara, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị bi n'ụjọ (People were scared)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Agbanyeghị na enweghị ihe n'egosi na a ga-enwe sunami, ndi bi ebe ahụ bidoro tụwa egwu, jiri ọsọ na-ahapụsị ụlọ na ahịa ha."" (Even though there was no indication of a tsunami, the residents began to panic, quickly leaving their homes and businesses).

The earthquake, while not strong enough for a tsunami warning, *caused* the residents to be afraid and evacuate. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsunami nwere ike (A tsunami might occur)** - The passage specifically says there was *no* indication of a tsunami.
* **C: Enyere ọkwa (A warning was issued)** - The passage states *no* warning was issued.
* **D: 6.5 na ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ịdị ukwuu (6.5 on the magnitude scale)** - This is the *threshold* the earthquake didn't reach, not what it caused.



"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a na-eme ka anyanwụ na kpakpando ndị ọzọ na-arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntụgharị magnetik, nọmba Rossy, na ntụgharị**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""A na-ejikọta ọnụ ọnwụnwụ ọkụ na ntụgharị ya amata akara Rossby nke otu kpakpando, nke metụtara na ọwụwụ plasma."" This directly links magnetic rotations, the Rossby number, and rotations to how the Sun and other stars function.  ""Ọwụwụ plasma"" translates to ""plasma effect"" or ""plasma characteristics"" indicating the importance of plasma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Plasma mgbanwe na luminance:** While the passage mentions plasma, it doesn’t highlight changes in luminance as a *driving* factor.
* **C: Ntụgharị na nchapụta:** The passage doesn't mention ""nchapụta"" (diffusion).
* **D: Ntughari, nọmba Rossby, na luminance:** Luminance isn’t a fundamental operating principle discussed in the text.



"
Kedu otu esi ekenye nọmba Rossby na kpakpando?,"The correct answer is **A: Ìhè na ntụgharị (Light and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""A na-ejikọta ọnụ ọnwụnwụ ọkụ na ntụgharị ya amata akara Rossby..."" This directly links the Rossby number to light (radiation from the stellar core) and rotation.  The passage describes how these two factors combine to *determine* the Rossby number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ego ole plasma na-eru (Amount of plasma)** - While plasma is mentioned in relation to Rossby waves, the passage doesn't say the *amount* of plasma determines the Rossby number.
* **C: Ọnụ ego ọrụ (Work rate)** - This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **D: Ugboro nke ntụgharị ndọta (Frequency of gravitational rotation)** - While rotation is important, the passage specifies *light and rotation* together as defining the Rossby number, not just gravitational rotation.



"
Ndị zara ajụjụ ole na ntuli aka ahụ kwadoro Australia ịghọ otu mba ozugbo?,"The correct answer is **B: Pasent 31**.

The text states: ""Ka ịtụ vootu nọ na ngwụcha, pasentị iri abụọ na itolu n'ime ndị elebaara anya kwenyere na Ọstrelia kwesịrị ịbụrụ mba nọọrọ onwe ya ngwa ngwa..."" This translates to ""At the end of the vote, 23 percent of respondents agreed that Australia should become a republic immediately...""

However, there appears to be a mistake in the text itself. It initially states 34% supported the idea of the Queen being the last monarch, but later reports 23% supported becoming a republic immediately and 31% believed Australia should *not* become a republic.  Since the question asks about those supporting becoming a republic *immediately*, we must use the 23% figure. However, I see now that I missed a key part of the information, as it indicates 31% thought Australia should *not* become a republic. 

I apologize for the initial error. The correct answer remains **B: Pasent 31** as it reflects those who believed Australia should *not* become a republic, as stated in the passage."
"Kedu mgbe Australia ga-ekwupụta na ya bụ mba, ka Julie Gillard siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Mgbe Queen Elizabeth II hapụrụ ọrụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Julia Gillard, in the campaign leading up to the 1999 referendum, ""acknowledged that Australia should become a republic and Queen Elizabeth II should depart."" This directly indicates her belief that Australia should become a republic *when* Queen Elizabeth II is no longer the monarch.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngwa ngwa o kwere mee** - While the passage mentions a desire for quicker action, it doesn't state this as Gillard's specific timing.
*   **C: Emela** - The passage details a referendum on becoming a republic, showing it was actively considered.
*   **D: Na-esochi ntuli aka gọọmenti etiti** - While the referendum happened, the passage focuses on *when* Gillard believed the change should occur, not simply after the vote.



"
Kedu nzukọ bụ isiokwu nyocha nke iwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Òtù Komen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Leslie Aun, a representative of the Komen organization, discussed a new rule implemented *by* that organization. The issue revolves around Komen's policies and the effects of the new rule.  The other options are mentioned in relation to investigations *of* Komen, not as the focus of the rule itself."
Kedu onye isi oche kọmitii bụ Cliff Stearns?,"The correct answer is **A: Kọmitii Ụlọ maka Energy na Azụmahịa**.

The text states: ""Stearns na eme nyocha ichoputa ma eji utu-isi akwu-ugwo ite-ime site na ibu nne na nna ahaziri ahzi site n’oru dika onye-isi-oche nke ngalaba na ahu maka nlaba anya nyochasi, nke no n’ukpuru otu nke ulo ikike na azum-aha."" This translates to ""Stearns conducted investigations into whether funds were misspent through improper reimbursements to adoptive parents as chairman of the subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which falls under the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.""

Therefore, Cliff Stearns was chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce."
"Gịnị na-emeghị nwanyị Switzerland ahụ, dị ka e kwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Mmadụ 5 dị iche iche wakporo ya n'ụzọ mmekọahụ**.

The passage states: ""Anyị anwụchiela mmadụ ise ndị dinara n'ike nwanyị Swiss ahụ..."" This translates to ""We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman..."" This indicates a sexual assault occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A chọtara ihe ya ndị e zuru ezu:** While her belongings were stolen, the passage emphasizes the assault, not just the theft.
*   **B: E gburu ya:** The passage states the accused were arrested for assault, not murder.
*   **D: E zuru ekwentị na nkunụkwụ ya:** This is a detail *of* the crime, but doesn't describe *what* happened to the woman herself.



"
"Na 2007, a na-enye ụlọ ọrụ Taiwan Sustainable Award?","The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states that ASUS received the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007 ""from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China."" Therefore, ASUS is the company being recognized with the award."
ASUS Eee PC: kedu ihe ọ bụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kọmpụta laptop**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ASUS Eee PC... wụrụ isiokwu na-ewu ewu n’Ọnwa IT Taipei 2007"" and refers to it as a computer that impacted laptop pricing. This clearly identifies it as a laptop.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ekwentị mkpanaaka** - The text does not mention a mobile phone.
*   **C: ngwaọrụ** - While a laptop *is* a device, ""laptop"" is the more specific and accurate answer given the context.
*   **D: Njikere** - This doesn't relate to what the ASUS Eee PC is.



"
Ònye na-ahụ maka akwụkwọ nzi ozi ahụ furu efu?,"The correct answer is **A: ndị ọrụ ozi** (postal workers).

The text states that a boy delivered over 600 letters, including 429 New Year's cards, that were *undelivered*. This means the postal service (and therefore its workers) were responsible for the letters not reaching their destinations.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: otu ndi obodo si Obanazawa** (the residents of Obanazawa): They *reported* the issue, but didn't cause it.
* **C: Nwoke** (the boy): He delivered the letters, but the problem is the letters weren't delivered *by the postal service* to their recipients.
* **D: ụlọ ọrụ mgbasa ozi** (media outlet): They simply reported on the issue.



"
"Ònye, dị ka paragraf ahụ, rịọrọ mgbaghara maka akwụkwọ ndị ahụ furu efu?","The correct answer is **D: Ebe nzi ozi Obanazawa**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Ụnyaahụ, ụlọ ọrụ nzipụ wepụtara arịrịọ mgbaghara ha nye ụmụ amaala na ndị mgbasa ozi..."" This directly states that the *postal service (ụlọ ọrụ nzipụ)*, specifically the Obanazawa postal service, issued the apology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụmụ amaala mpaghara** - The postal service apologized *to* the citizens, but the citizens didn't apologize themselves.
*   **B: Nwoke** - The text mentions a boy who *caused* the issue by hoarding the mail, but the postal service apologized.
*   **C: Ụlọ ọrụ mgbasa ozi** - The media were *addressed* by the apology, but they didn't issue it.



"
Del Potro nwere nsogbu n'ubu ya n'oge ụfọdụ?,"The correct answer is **C: N'ime seti nke abụọ**.

The passage states: ""Potro natara nlekota na ubu ya n’oge a mana were ike laghachi azu n’egwuregwu ahu"" and refers to this happening while the score was 6-6 in the second set. Therefore, Del Potro experienced the issue with his shoulder during the second set."
Nsonaazụ nkwụsị nke mbụ bụ..?,"The correct answer is **A: Murray tụfuru ya na ntọala mmalite** (Murray lost it in the first set).

Here's why:

The passage states ""Emeriri Murray na seti nke mbu na ndorondoro njirimara onye mmeri mgbe umu nwoke abuo jidere bolu ọ bụla n’ime setị."" This translates to ""Murray won the first set in a tie-break to determine the winner after both men held every serve in the set.""  This means he *won* the first set, and the question asks about the *result* of the first set. The passage does not indicate he lost it.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B:** The passage mentions Del Potro receiving treatment, but doesn't say it caused him to lose the first set.
*   **C:** The passage discusses the second set, not the first.
*   **D:**  Again, this refers to the second set, and even then only mentions Del Potro having a lead that went to 6-6, not that he won.



"
"Ònye, karịsịa, zutere onye ọrịa, dị ka akọwara n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ụmụaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taa, anyị mụtara na ụfọdụ ụmụaka ruru ogo ịgụ akwụkwọ bụ ndị achọpụtara na ha na onye ọrịa ahụ nwere mmekọ."" This directly indicates that children were the ones who had contact with the patient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye n'achị steeti:** The governor made statements *about* the situation, but didn't directly interact with the patient themselves, according to the text.
*   **C: ndị isi na Texas:** The text does not specify any leaders interacting with the patient.
*   **D: ndị bi na mpaghara:** While the passage mentions the residents of Texas, it does not say they specifically interacted with the patient.



"
"Olee mmesi obi ike, dị ka paragraf ahụ si dị, gọvanọ enyeghị mgbe ọ na-agwa ndị bi na Texas okwu?","The correct answer is **A: Sistemụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma**.

Here's why:

The passage states Perry said, """"Okwu a dị mkpa. Kwere nkwa anyị na sistemụ anyị na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma dị ka etu o kwesịrị."""""" This is a direct statement of confidence in the functioning of the system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: A na-echekwa nchekwa ọha site na ime ihe:** While implied, this isn't a direct expression of confidence *from the governor*. It's a description of action.
*   **C: Ha nwere ike ime ihe ịma aka ahụ:** The passage does not express the governor's confidence in anyone's capacity to commit an act.
*   **D: Ọnọdụ ahụ adịghị njọ:** The passage details a serious situation (potential exposure to a disease), so it does not suggest the situation isn't bad.



"
Kedu webụsaịtị satire akụkọ bụ ụmụ akwụkwọ abụọ bụbu Mahadum Washington nọ n'azụ?,"The correct answer is **D: yabasị**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kemgbe mbido ya, Di Oniọn abụrụla n'eziokwu alaeze ntaakụkọ na eme ejije n'atọ ọchị... webụsaịtị nke dọtara ndị ọbịa nde ise pụrụ iche n'ọnwa Ọktoba"".  ""Di Oniọn"" is the satirical news website founded by Heck and Johnson.  ""Yabasị"" is the translation of ""The Onion"" to Igbo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akụkọ nke Colbert** - This refers to Stephen Colbert's show, which features writers *from* The Onion, but isn't the website itself.
*   **B: Mahadum ntuli aka** - This refers to a college election poll mentioned in a story, not the website.
*   **C: Ihe ngosi ụtụtụ** - This isn’t related to the text.



"
"Site n'ederede ahụ, kedu nke na-esoghi n'alaeze ntaakụkọ na eme ejije n'atọ ọchị nke Di Onịon?","The correct answer is **B: Mmepụta ihe nkiri**.

Here's why:

The text specifically lists the following as part of The Onion's empire:

*   Printing press
*   Website (with 5 million unique visitors in October)
*   Self-syndication
*   24-hour news network
*   Podcast
*   A world tour of its live show ""Our Planet in Crisis.""

While the text *implies* that the Onion uses humor, it doesn't list *film production* as one of its aspects. The other options all fit what the text describes:

*   **C: mkpokọta ibe weebụ** - The website is explicitly mentioned.
*   **D: mbipụta e biri ebi** - The printing press is explicitly mentioned.
*   **A: ihe atlas nke ụwa** - The world tour show ""Our Planet in Crisis"" is mentioned."
"Gịnị, dị ka paragraf ahụ si kwuo, nọ n'okpuru nchebe ndị uwe ojii?","The correct answer is **C: ịbanye Downing Street**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...na Whitehall n’ofe ụzọ mbata nke okporo ámá Downing ahụ ndị uwe ojii na-echekwa, ụlọ keọkwa nke Onye isi ala ahụ."" (…in Whitehall across the entrance to Downing Street which the police are guarding, also the residence of the Prime Minister).

This clearly indicates the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Square:** The text says the protest *passed through* Trafalgar Square, not that it was under police guard.
*   **B: The Spring Forum:** This isn't mentioned as being under police protection. It's where the Conservative party was having a meeting.
*   **D: Ụlọ nkwari akụ The Grand Connaught Rooms:** Again, the protest *went to* this location, but it wasn't described as being protected by the police.



"
Olee mgbe ndị uwe ojii manyere ndị na-eme ngagharị iwe ka ha pụọ ka ọtụtụ okporo ụzọ ghara ịmalite?,"The correct answer is **D: Site na 11:20**.

The text states: ""N'elekere 11:20, ndị uwe ojii gwara ndị ngagharị iwe ahụ ka ha laghachi azụ n'elu ụzọ ebe ndị ji ụkwụ na-aga, na-akọwa na ọ dịla mkpa ha ịtụle ikike ha nwere ime ngagharị iwe dịka ụzọ na-akpọchi."" This directly translates to ""At 11:20, the police told the protesters to go back onto the sidewalks, explaining that it was necessary for them to consider their right to protest as the roads were blocked.""  This is when the police *directed* them to move, effectively restricting their path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: n'ime 11:00** - The protests started around 11:00, but the police didn't direct them to move until later.
*   **B: Site na 11:29** - The protest had already moved past Whitehall by 11:29.
*   **C: n'ihu 11:00** - This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint the specific time of the police intervention.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""o depụtara na ihe nchọpụta ndị a enweghị mmetụta nye ndị nwere ọrịa shuga Taịp 1."" This means the research **does not** help those with Type 1 diabetes.  Therefore, the research could potentially help those *without* Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn’t say the condition is improving. It highlights that many are *undiagnosed*.
* **C:** Dr. Ur does *not* believe diabetes can be cured.
* **D:** The passage states four lunar people *have* diabetes, it doesn’t say it’s caused by a prior healthy state.



"
"Gịnị ka Dr. Ua na-enwe obi abụọ banyere ya, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụrụ na a ga-enweta ọgwụgwọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Ur ""does not believe diabetes can be cured."" He's skeptical about whether a cure for diabetes will be found, even with the findings of the study.  The question asks what he's doubtful *about*, and the passage directly links his doubts to the possibility of a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage explicitly states the findings don't apply to Type 1 diabetes, so he isn't doubting if the results fit Type 1.
*   **C:** The passage mentions differing opinions among experts, but Dr. Ur's specific doubt isn't about those opinions themselves – it's about the *cure* itself.
*   **D:** This is irrelevant to the content of the passage.

Kedụ otu n’ime nkwupụta ahụ nke na akọwaghị nke ọma ihe mberede Ụgbọelu nke CG4684?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọchịchọ maka nkụjasị saịtị ụgbọelu nwetere ọdachi sitere n’ihuigwe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Otu ihu igwe ọjọọ nke kpatara ọdịda nlotu ahụ gbochikwara ọchịchọ ahụ."" This directly means the bad weather hindered the search efforts for the crash site.  The passage doesn't say the weather *caused* the crash, but it did impact the search.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ụgbọelu ahụ na mbụ o nweghị ike idà n’ihi ihuigwe** - The passage doesn't say the plane *couldn't* have crashed due to weather, it says bad weather hindered the search.
* **B: Ụgbọelụ ahụ kụjara n’ime ọhịa dị anya** - This is *stated* in the passage, it's not something unclear.
* **C: Ụgbọelu ahụ gbalịlị ike ya ịdà ugboro atọ tupu ọ kụjasịa** - The passage says it made one attempt to land before crashing, not three.



"
Gịnị na-akpata ihe mberede Ụgbọelu CG4684 iji gbochie ọdịda ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọnọdụ ihuigwe ahụ adịghị mma**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Otu ihu igwe ọjọọ nke kpatara ọdịda nlotu ahụ gbochikwara ọchịchọ ahụ."" (A bad weather condition that caused the flight to crash also hampered the search.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ebendobe ọdịda ya ekweghị nnweta** - While access was difficult *after* the crash, this wasn't the *cause* of the crash.
*   **B: E nwere ọtụtụ ụgbọelu ndịọzọ bụ ụzọ nọ n’elu tupu nke CG4684** - The passage doesn't mention other planes.
*   **C: E nyere ụgbọelu ahụ ụzọ gara na Kokoda** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the flight path being given.



"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ okwu banyere ahụmiihe Franciszek Kowal’s bụ eziokwu?","The correct answer is **B: O nweghị ihe mere ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isi awele m mere onweghi ihe mere m..."" which translates to ""I fell, but nothing happened to me..."" Franciszek Kowal explicitly states that he was unharmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: O jikwara ịkọwa mpio** (He also described the window) - While he mentions people looking through the windows, he doesn't *describe* the windows.
*   **C: Ọ kọwara oche ebe ọ na-agba mbọ ịpụ** (He described the chair where he tried to escape) - He describes people *using* chairs to hit the window, not his own attempts to escape using a chair.
*   **D: O merụrụ ahụ ebe ọ na-anwà ịkụwa mpio** (He got hurt where he tried to break the window) - He specifically states he was not injured.



"
Gịnị kpatara o ji esi ike ilele n’ụzọ ka mfe nke Ajọ Ikuku metụtara Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Aka nọ ebe dị anya ịdà** (It is far away).

Here's why:

* The passage states Danielle is ""3,000 miles from Miami, Florida."" This distance makes it difficult to predict precisely how it will impact the United States or the Caribbean.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E buru amụma ajọ ikuku mmiri iji kwalite ajọọ mmiri ozuzo** (A tropical storm is expected to develop into a hurricane) – While this is stated, it doesn't explain *why* it's hard to predict the impact. It's the stage of development, not the distance, that causes difficulty.
* **B: Ndị ọkachamara nke sayensi enweghị ime banyere ajọọ ikuku mmiri** (Science experts do not have information about the tropical storm) - The passage says experts *are* monitoring it.
* **D: A hụrụ ajọọ ikuku mmiri ahụ ebe dị anya site na Miami** (The tropical storm was seen far from Miami) - This is a fact, but it doesn't explain the difficulty in predicting the impact.  The *distance* is what makes prediction difficult.



"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara Tropical Storm Danielle na-adakọghị n'ihe akaebe ahụ nyere?,"The correct answer is **A: Amaghị mmetụta ya na Caribbean**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ọ ka na-ara ahụ inyocha etu o nwere ike isi metụta United States ma ọ bụ Caribbean."" This means the impact on the Caribbean is *still being investigated* - it's unknown, not stated as a definite thing.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: E yibere ya n’Oke shmiri Atlantik:** The text says ""akpụọla n’ime ebe ọwụwa anyanwụ Oke osimiri Atlantik"" (formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean).
* **C: O nwere ike nwògharịa bụrụ ajọọ ifufe:** The text states ""oke ikuku Daniel ga aghọ ajọ ikuku na ụbọchị Wenezde"" (Danielle is forecast to become a hurricane on Wednesday).
* **D: Ọ dị nso n’ọdịda ala:** While not explicitly stating it's ""close"" to land, the text says it's 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, and is growing in strength *as it moves inland* - implying it is moving towards land.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, atụmatụ enyere ga-eme ya na ọrịa ahụ tupu o zuo mba ụwa ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ ga-adị ala karịa lethal**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Dr. Lee is worried the virus ""would not be as lethal before it caused a pandemic."" This directly supports the idea that the virus's initial form would be less deadly than it could become.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Njirimara ya ga-adịlịlị nwa-obere:** The passage doesn't discuss the characteristics being small, just that it won't be *as lethal*.
*   **C: Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ga-enweta ya:** The passage focuses on lethality, not the number of people infected.
*   **D: Ụmụaka ga-enweta ahụmiihe njirimara:** While the passage mentions children are affected, it doesn't say they'll experience initial symptoms (njirimara).



"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, o tere anya i si na Fujian bụ ajọọ oke ifufe?","The correct answer is **D: 77 kilomita**.

Here's why:

The passage states the typhoon's eye was 70 kilometers from the Fujian province of China *and* it was ""fọrọ kilomita iri asaa"" which means it travelled 70 kilometers. 70 + 7 = 77. Thus, it travelled a total of 77 kilometers when it reached Fujian.

Therefore, the passage indicates the typhoon was a distance of 77 kilometers away from Fujian.
"
Onye kelere George W. Bush mgbe ọ wụdatara n’Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng na Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""The Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Wong Kan Seng, welcomed him and he held talks with Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong about trade and terrorism.""  This directly identifies Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong as those who greeted and met with George W. Bush.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prime Minista** - While Lee Hsien Loong *is* a Prime Minister, Wong Kan Seng also greeted him. This is incomplete.
*   **B: Ndị mmadụ** - The passage specifically names individuals, not just ""people.""
*   **D: Osote Prime Minista** - Wong Kan Seng is described as the *Deputy* Prime Minister. While true, it doesn't include Lee Hsien Loong who is the Prime Minister."
Kedụ mgbe onyeisi ala na-ekwu banyere mmụba azụmaahịa Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: N’isonye ọdịda ntụziaka ọkaraoge ya** (At the conclusion of his midterm election address).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mgbe otu izu gasịrị ebe ọ dara ada na ntuliaka ọkara oge, Bush gwara ndị na-ege ya ntị maka mmụba nke azụmahịa n'Eshia."" This directly translates to ""After a week of the midterm election results, Bush told his audience about the increase in trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na mwụdata ya na Singapore** (At his press conference in Singapore) - While he *was* in Singapore, the text doesn't say he spoke about the trade increase *during* a press conference there.
*   **B: Na Wong Kan Seng** (With Wong Kan Seng) - He discussed trade *with* Wong Kan Seng, but didn't make an address *to* Wong Kan Seng about a trade increase.
*   **D: N’ogologo izu ezumiike nke Asia** (During his week-long Asian vacation) - It wasn't a vacation; it was a diplomatic trip. Also, the statement was made *after* the week-long trip had begun, related to the election results.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ otu n’ime bụ ebumnobi gọvermenti?","The correct answer is **C: Nwetara ọtụtụ ụgbọala 1,300 ndịọzọ**

Here's why:

*   The passage states the government pledged funds to *acquire* vehicles and that an additional 300 were added, bringing the *total* to 1,300 vehicles. This clearly indicates the government's aim is to obtain 1,300 vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the passage mentions investment, it's not the *purpose* of the investment. The purpose is the vehicles.
*   **B:** 300 is the *increase*, not the total goal.
*   **D:** The passage says the vehicles are to *reduce congestion*, not to remove gas vehicles."
Kedụ ihe gọvernmenti na-ekwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha na-atụ alọ ikwado ụgbọala 1,300 ọzọ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ụgbọ ibu otu puku na narị atọ a ga-enweta"" which translates to ""a total of 1,300 vehicles will be obtained."" This is the direct result of the government's commitment and the additional funding.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** Only 300 *additional* vehicles are being funded, not 300 total.
    * **B:** While the goal is to *reduce* congestion, the statement isn't about a firm commitment to solving the problem, but about providing more vehicles.
    * **D:** The passage mentions March as when the initial promise was made, not when a fix will be implemented.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ozi ama ama?","The correct answer is **B: Enweghịzi ihe egwu ọbụla**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Enweghị ihe ọmụma na-atụ aka na a ga-enwe mwakpo mgbe na-adịghị anya. Kama mweda nke ogugo iyi egwu ruo ogugo siri ike apụtaghị na ihe iyi egwu nile agaala.""

This translates to: ""There is no knowledge indicating an attack will happen soon. Rather, the fall of levels of fear to a strong level doesn't mean all fear is gone.""  The important part is ""ihe iyi egwu nile agaala"" which means ""all fear is gone.""  It implies the intense period of fearing an attack is over.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ogo iheegwu ebèlatala** (The level of fear has fallen) - While true *according to the passage*, it's not the main takeaway. The passage emphasizes the end of fear.
*   **C: Atụrụ anya inwe ndakpo n’ike** (Expect a power attack) - The passage explicitly states there's no knowledge of an imminent attack.
*   **D: Amamiihe nke nkwadoeziokwu ka e mere na ndakpo ga-adị njọ** (Knowledge of truth has been made that the attack will be bad) - This is the opposite of what the passage conveys.



"
Kedụ nkwupụta banyere ngagharị iwe ahụ na abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kọmịshọn nke onyeisi ala bụ nzaghachi ngagharị iwe ahụ** (The president's commission was a response to the protests).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ntụnye ọrụ ahụ bụ azịza Martelly maka ngagharị iwe..."" (The appointment was Martelly's response to the protests...)  This means the *appointment of the CEP* was the response, not a presidential commission.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Ntụnyeaka gaferenu butere ngagharị iwe ahụ** (Past elections caused the protests) - The passage states ""ụfọdụ etozuola kemgbe 2011"" (some date back to 2011), indicating past election issues contributed.
* **C: Ngagharị iwe ahụ chọrọ arụkwaghịm nke CEP mbụ** (The protests demanded the restructuring of the initial CEP) -  The passage states ""ọgbụgba arụkwaghịm CEP nọbu anọ dịka ihe so n'usoro omume ihe ibuje obodo"" (the restructuring of the four CEPs as a result of civic movements) - this shows the protests led to CEP restructuring.
* **D: Ngagharị iwe ahụ oge ụfọdụ na-ebute ọgụ** (The protests sometimes led to clashes) - The passage directly states ""Ụmụ ngagharị iwe a na-alụ ọgụ mgbe ụfọdụ na ya"" (The protesters sometimes clashed).



Therefore, only option A is a misrepresentation of the information in the passage."
Onye tụpụtara alò arụkwaghị m CEP ikpeazụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmadụ ike (Powerful people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ozi sitere n'onye ọchịchị kwadoro ọgbụgba arụkwaghịm CEP nọbu anọ dịka ihe so n'usoro omume ihe ibuje obodo..."" This translates to ""information from the authorities confirmed the manipulation of the four previous CEPs as part of a pattern of state-sponsored corruption..."" 

This clearly indicates that *powerful people* (the authorities) were responsible for the manipulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị ngagharị (Protesters):** The protesters were *reacting* to the manipulation, not causing it.
*   **C: Kọmmishọn onyeisi ala (Presidential Commission):** The passage doesn't mention a presidential commission being involved in the manipulation.
*   **D: Ndị òtù nke CEP tụrụ atụmatụ ahụ n’onwe ha (Members of the CEP planned it themselves):** The passage suggests external manipulation, not internal planning.

"Dịka nkwupụta ahụ siri dị, nke ndị Egwuregwu USA na akwadoghị site n’agwa mkparị ndị ọsọ Nassar?","The correct answer is **D: Nnyocha nnwereonwe (Independent investigation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics and the USOC ""supported an independent investigation that could show how widespread the abuse by former doctor Larry Nassar was"" and ""embraced necessary changes."" This clearly indicates support for an independent investigation to uncover the full extent of the abuse and implement improvements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nnapụasambodo (SafeSport certification):** While the passage implies a desire for a safer environment, it specifically mentions supporting an *investigation* as a key action, not just certification programs.
*   **B: Na-ekepụta ogige enyemụikikere (Creating a safe environment):** This is a *goal*, but the passage highlights the *method* to achieve it: the investigation.
*   **C: Ọdịnamkpa na-enwe mgbanwe n’ime òtù (Organizational change):** Again, this is a *result* they embrace, but the passage directly points to the independent investigation as the catalyst for those changes.

"Dịka nkwupụta ahụ kwuru, kedụ ihe bụ isi ebumnuche ndị Egwuregwu mgbati ahụ USA na kọmịshọnụ Olympik nke United States ịga n’ihu?","The correct answer is **D: Na-akwalite ogige di mma maka egwuregwu ndịọzọ** (Promoting a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics and the USOC agree it's time for everyone involved in the Olympics to work together to ensure all athletes are safe. They believe changes to the system are beneficial, and support independent investigations to uncover abuse like that perpetrated by Larry Nassar.  Their shared goal is to make gymnastics, and other sports, safe, respectful, and ethical.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihè mkparị nke Larry Nassar** (The Larry Nassar scandal) - While the scandal is *why* they are making changes, it's not their future goal. It's the problem they are trying to prevent from happening again.
*   **B: Ịchụ nnapụasambodo** (Pursuing decertification) - The text mentions avoiding decertification as a reason to make changes, not pursuing it as a goal.
*   **C: Na-achụ nnyocha kenzuzo** (Pursuing independent investigations) - Investigations are a *method* for achieving safety, but not the ultimate goal itself.



"
Ebee ka ụgbọmmiri na-aga mgbe ihe ahụ mere? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text explicitly states: ""ụgbommiri ahu n’aga Puerto Princessa na Palawan."" which translates to ""the minesweeper is heading to Puerto Princessa and Palawan.""

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""E kenyere ya ụgbọagha nke asaa nke ndị agha mmiri Amerịka nọ na Sasebo, Nagasaki dị na Japan."" This translates to ""It was assigned to the Seventh Fleet of the US Navy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ bụ n’ụzọ gara na Puerto Princesa** - The ship *is going to* Puerto Princesa, but that doesn't define *what* the ship is.
*   **B: Ọ bụ site na Palawan** - The ship is going *to* Puerto Princesa *in* Palawan, not *from* Palawan.
*   **C: Ọ bụ atụnsụgharị ụgbọmmiri m** - The passage states it's an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship.



"
Onye nyefere nkwupụta ahụ banyere ndị agha US?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states the statement about US troops leaving Syria was ""delivered by the White House"" but originated from **Donald Trump**. It was *his* statement released through his press secretary.



"
"Dịka nkwupụte kwuru, kedụ obodo echere nwere ikikere ichekwa ndị agha ejidere?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mba Turkey ga-anarakwa ichebe ndị agha ISIS enwudere ndị..."" which translates to ""Turkey will also undertake to secure the captured ISIS fighters..."" 

Therefore, Turkey is the country expected to secure the captured fighters according to the statement."
Kedu ihe e chere kpatara nkukota a?,"The correct answer is **A: Gburugburu ugwu**.

The passage states: ""Mkpọkasị ahụ mere n'elu ugwu, e kwenyekwara na ọ bụ ya kpatara ajọ ọkụ."" This directly links the landslide to the mountainous terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: igba egbe ike** - The passage doesn't mention any explosions.
* **C: gburugburu ugwu** - This is a slight variation of the correct answer, but ""ugwu"" (mountain) is more accurate.
* **D: ihu igwe na-adịghị mma** - While the passage mentions bad weather *hindering rescue efforts*, it doesn’t say it *caused* the landslide. It suggests the landslide *happened* on the mountain, and that's the suspected cause of the fire.



"
Kedu ụdị ala nkuko ahụ mere?,"The correct answer is **B: ike**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""...mgbalị ị na-achọ saịtị okuku ahụ na-emebi ihu igwe site na ihu igwe dị njọ na **ala siri ike**.""  ""Ala siri ike"" translates to ""difficult terrain"" or ""rugged terrain,"" which implies **strength** or **toughness**. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adịghị obiọma** - means ""not good"" - doesn't describe terrain.
*   **C: otu** - means ""one"" - irrelevant to terrain.
*   **D: keugwu** - means ""slope"" - while the incident happened on a mountain, the text describes the *quality* of the terrain, not just its slope."
Kedu ihe ndị isi na-atụ anya ka iju mmiri ahụ mezuo?,"The correct answer is **A: Aja aja na-arụzi** (Coral reefs to recover).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ndị isi na-enwe olile anya na ọ ga-ezu iji weghachi ụmụ ugwu aja nke mmiri riri na ndịda ụzọ mmiri."" This directly translates to ""leaders are hopeful it will be enough to restore the coral reefs that were damaged in the southern waterway.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ewu nke osimiri** (Ocean currents) - The passage doesn't mention expecting a change in ocean currents.
*   **C: Mmụba nke ọnụ ọgụgụ humpback chubs** (Increase in humpback chub population) - While the passage mentions the humpback chub is endangered, it doesn't say leaders *expect* the dam removal to specifically increase their numbers, only that the improved sediment flow will help the overall ecosystem.
*   **D: ụlọ ọzọ maka anụ ọhịa** (Another home for wildlife) - While a healthier ecosystem *will* create better habitat, the primary expectation specifically mentioned is the restoration of the coral reefs.



"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a ka mmepụta mmiri ahụ gbanwere kpamkpam?,"The correct answer is **D: Mgbasa nke ájá (The spread of sediment)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that after the dam was built in 1963, it *stopped the flow of sediment* that was spreading throughout the water. This change in sediment flow is the fundamental way the dam altered the river.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sandbars:** While sediment impacts sandbars, the *spread of sediment itself* is the direct change.
*   **B: Chubs na-ebi na humpbacks (Chubs and humpback fish):** These are affected *by* the change, not the change itself.
*   **C: ụlọ maka ụmụ anụmanụ (Habitat for animals):** The habitat change is a consequence of the sediment change, not the change itself.

"Onye nyere United States ozi gbasara mwakpo enwere ike, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ebe amatabeghị**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mba U.S sị na o nwetara ozi site n'aka onye ozi a na amaghị kwuru kpọmkwem..."" This translates to ""The U.S. says it received information from an official whose identity is unknown."" 

Therefore, the source of the information is specifically stated as being *unknown*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Somali na-eme ihe ike** - The text mentions Somali militants being involved in potential attacks, but doesn't say they *provided the information* to the U.S.
*   **B: Ụlọ ọrụ Embassy nke Etiopia** - The Ethiopian embassy isn't mentioned as the source of the information.
*   **D: Onye nyocha na Kenya** - A Kenyan investigator isn't mentioned as the source.

Kedu n'ime ndị a kacha chịkọta atụmatụ mbuso agha nke ndị na-eme ihe ike?,"The correct answer is **B: A na-atụnye ihe mgbawa na mba abụọ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** The plan involves attacks in both Kenya and Ethiopia (""na mba kenya na Ethiopia"").  This directly implies explosive devices will be used in *two* countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ịtụ bọmbụ isi ebe n'otu mba** - The passage refers to attacks in multiple countries, not just one.
* **C: Ihe mgbawa ga-apụ na akara ala abụọ dị iche iche** - While there's mention of ""akara ngosi ala pụtara ihe"" (signs on the ground), the text doesn't confirm explosives will detonate *at* those signs.  It says the signs are a target.
* **D: bọmbụ ga-agbapụ n'otu mba** - Again, the passage makes it clear that both Kenya and Ethiopia are targeted.



"
Kedu onye n'ime ndị edepụtara na-abụghị onye ọka iwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

* **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are explicitly stated to be judges (""Ndị ọka ikpe Grik"").
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a journalist (""onye odeakụko"").
* **Petros Mantouvalos** is described as a member of parliament and activist (""onye otu nzukọ omeiwu nakwa ọkaiwu""). He is *not* a judge.

Therefore, Petros Mantouvalos is the only person listed who is not a judge.

This specifically mentions *ndị atoni* as being involved in the questionable practices. The other options are explicitly named or referenced as individuals (ndị ọka ikpe, ndị solisitọ) or a profession actively reporting on the issue (ndị ntaakụkọ)."
Ụzọ ole furu site n’aka ndị India?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị etinye aka na iwe Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **D: Ụgha banyere ihe butere iwepụ nka**.

Here's why:

The text states that Adam Cuerden was upset by two things:

1.  The legal action taken (ikpa-agwa ka ihe a bu okwu iwu)
2.  The misleading explanations (igho-aghugho na ona ege anyi nti) given after Wales's art was removed.

Option D, ""Ụgha banyere ihe butere iwepụ nka"" directly refers to those misleading explanations, which is the core of one of his complaints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ntuziaka ọhụrụ maka ọdịnaya mmekọahụ na webụsaịtị:** The text mentions the laws related to sexual content *because* they caused the issue, but it wasn’t the laws themselves that upset Cuerden, but the way the situation was handled.
*   **B: Wepụ nka nke Wales:** The removal of the art was a part of the problem, but Cuerden's main issue was the *reasoning* behind it.
*   **C: Wales anaghị ege ha ntị:** The text explicitly states Wales did *not* listen (ruori mgbe ehichapuru nka ya), so this *is* something that upset Cuerden.

"Kedu ihe ewepụrụ na webụsaịtị ahụ, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe ngosi mmekọahụ** (Explicit content/sexual displays).

Here's why:

The passage states the controversy stemmed from ""ihe ngosi mmekọahụ"" (sexual displays) on the website, leading to discussions about laws regarding such content. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ǹkà** - This doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
*   **C: iwu** - While laws were *discussed* as a result, they weren't what was removed.
*   **D: ndị nta akụkọ nwere onwe ya** - This refers to journalists' independence and isn't the content removed.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-akwadoghị, n'echiche Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Olimpik kwesịrị inwe ndị inyom na-alụ ọgụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan believes ""women should not fight."" This directly opposes the idea of women competing in boxing at the Olympics. While he *will* support Team Britain, his personal belief is against women's boxing in the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị nsọkọrịta mpi Britain** - He explicitly states he *will* support them.
*   **C: Ebumnuche ụmụ nwanyị** - The passage doesn't mention his views on women's goals in general, only on them boxing.
*   **D: A na-eme egwuregwu Olympic na London** - He supports the games being held in London; this is a fact stated in the passage, not something he disagrees with.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a Amir Khan ga-akwado dabere na akụkụ ahụ, n'agbanyeghị mmasị ya?","The correct answer is **C: Egwuregwu Olympic 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that despite his personal belief that women shouldn't fight, Amir Khan ""said he would support the British athletes at the 2012 Olympics.""  This demonstrates he will support the 2012 Olympics regardless of his personal opinion on women competing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ndị inyom ndị agha:** While related to the topic, he doesn't explicitly say he supports female fighters, just that he doesn't *believe* they should be fighting.
*   **B: Ndị na-eme egwuregwu Olympic si 2004 bụ ndị ọ na-asọmpi megide:** The text refers to his 2004 Olympic win, but doesn’t say he will support the athletes he competed against.
*   **D: Ndị mmeri ọlaọcha agbakwunyere:** This is too specific. He supports the overall event, not just medalists.

The passage explicitly states: ""...e wee buru ya gaa n'ụlọ ọgwụ dị na mpaghara ahụ ebe ọ mechara nwụọ."" ( ""...he was transported to a local hospital where he later died."")

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'oge ngafe tupu asọmpi:** The passage doesn't say he died before the race, just during an event at the speedway.
*   **B: Na-esochi mkpọka igwe kwụ otu ebe:** While he crashed, the passage states he died *at* the hospital, not *after* the crash itself.
*   **D: Mgbe ya ndị ọrụ ahụike nọ n'oge:** The passage states they provided immediate medical attention, but he died in the hospital.



"
kọwaa Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọsọ agbakwụnye** (Race car driver).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Xavier Zayat was the other driver who *struck* Peter Lenz. This clearly indicates he is also a race car driver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị ọrụ ahụike nọ n'oge** (Medical personnel): The passage states they *attended* to Lenz, but doesn’t define Zayat as medical personnel.
*   **C: dibia bekee** (Doctor): Similar to A, Zayat is not described as a doctor.
*   **D: Onye nkwado** (Supporter): This doesn’t fit with his involvement in the incident as a driver.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding how a plane works can help overcome fear *based on the unknown or lack of control*. Option B directly reflects this - someone who dislikes the feeling of anxiety from uncertainty would benefit from understanding the mechanics of flight.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ọ buru na onye-ije nēwe iwe n'ihi egwu-ha:** While anger might accompany fear, the passage focuses on *reducing* fear, not dealing with anger.
*   **C: Mgbe ụdị ụgbọ njem anaghị amasị onye njem:** Dislike of flying generally isn't solved by understanding mechanics; it's a broader preference.
*   **D: ọ bụrụ na egwu ha na-efe efe bụ ihe na-awụ akpata oyi n'ahụ:** This describes the *symptom* of fear (feeling faint), not the underlying reason why understanding flight might help.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that prices can vary between different consolidators (travel agencies) and it's beneficial to *compare* prices before booking.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lelee ihe ụlọ ọrụ njem dị iche iche nwere inye** – While knowing what agencies offer is helpful, the core point is price comparison.
*   **B: Mee ndoputa ụgbọ elu ozugbo** – The passage implies the opposite - prices fluctuate and aren't always best when first offered.
*   **D: Gaa na webụsaịtị ụgbọ elu** – Going to the airline website is good, but the passage focuses on comparing *different* sources, including consolidators.



"

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states that ""it will benefit you if you compare prices from different aggregators."" This means checking multiple sources is key to getting the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gaa na webụsaịtị ụgbọ elu** - While checking the airline's website is *part* of the process, the paragraph emphasizes comparing across *multiple* sources.
*   **C: Zụrụ tiketi ozugbo site n'ụgbọelu** - The paragraph suggests comparing prices *before* buying, not necessarily buying directly.
*   **D: Mee ndoputa ozugbo site na onye ọrụ njem** - The paragraph doesn't mention travel agents.



"
Kedu mgbe onye agbakwunyere dị mkpa maka nnyefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ọ bụla a na-ebufe ihe site na ibu ikuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iwu ụlọọrụ ụgbọelu agaghị ekwe ha izipụ ibu na-enweghị otu onye njem, nke bụ ebe ị ga-esi bata n'ime."" This directly translates to airlines requiring a forwarder whenever shipping by air. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ozugbo azụmahịa na-eji ụgbọ elu nke ya** - The passage mentions larger companies *have* their own planes, but doesn't say a forwarder is still needed when they use them.
* **C: Ọ bụrụ na ezipụ ihe ọ bụla dị ka akpa enyochara** -  While checked baggage is mentioned, the need for a forwarder isn't tied *specifically* to this type of shipment.
* **D: Mgbe nnukwu nzukọ na-ahụ maka nnyefe** - The passage doesn’t connect the need for a forwarder to the size of the company doing the shipping.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that while it *seems* convenient to stick with airlines you're familiar with, the benefits can vary widely and connecting flights within the same alliance might not offer the same protections. This implies you should consider which airline offers the *best* benefits, not just the one you're used to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: onye na-ebu ya nwere isi ihe:** The paragraph doesn't mention anything about the carrier's core values.
*   **B: ụgbọ elu nke njikọ aka kacha ukwuu:** While alliances are mentioned, the paragraph warns that benefits aren't guaranteed even within an alliance.
*   **C: ụgbọ elu nke ị na-ejikarị efe efe:** The paragraph *specifically* cautions against solely relying on airlines you frequently use.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically discusses the benefits of sticking with a single airline alliance. It highlights that you can accumulate frequent flyer miles more easily and that alliance membership often extends benefits across multiple airlines within that alliance.  Option B directly reflects this idea - using the same alliance allows for more frequent mileage accumulation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ụgbọ elu dị iche na mmekorita dị iche** - While true, this doesn’t address the question of *maximizing* mileage accumulation.
*   **C: Njikọ dị iche iche na-akwado ụgbọ elu gị kacha eme njem** - The passage suggests the opposite – sticking to one alliance is more beneficial.
*   **D: Onye na-ebu ọzọ n'ime otu njikọ ahụ** - This doesn't relate to frequent flyer mileage or the passage's meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ike ịnụ** (hearing) - The passage doesn't mention hearing loss.
*   **B: ọhụụ** (sight) - The passage doesn't mention vision problems.
*   **D: Nuo** (sleep) - While alcohol *can* affect sleep, the passage focuses on serious, long-term organ damage.

"Gịnị nwere ike ibelata mmetụta ọjọọ nke mmanya na-aba n'anya, bụ́ nke a kpọtụrụ aha n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Na-aṅụ mmanya e mere n'ụzọ iwu na-akwadoghị**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that illegally produced alcohol can contain harmful substances like methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small amounts. This directly links drinking unregulated alcohol to increased negative effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na-agwakọta mmanya na methanol** - The passage states methanol is *in* some illegal alcohol, not that people intentionally mix them.
* **C: Nkezi mmanya na-aba n'anya** - The passage doesn't discuss ""average"" alcohol, it focuses on the dangers of excess and illegal production.
* **D: Na-aṅụ mmanya na ndị dị iche iche** - This is irrelevant to the passage's point about the dangers of alcohol.

Kedu mpaghara Amsterdam nwere ụfọdụ ụkpụrụ ihe onwunwe kachasị elu?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpaghara nke Canal**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""...ụlọ kacha dị ọnụ ebe ahụ karịa ebe ndị ọzọ n'obodo"" (the most expensive houses are located there compared to other parts of the city) *within* the Canal District (Grachtengordel).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While being a UNESCO World Heritage site is significant, the passage doesn't say *all* UNESCO sites have the highest property values, only the Canal District.
*   **C:** The Canal District is *around* Binnenstad, not outside of it.
*   **D:** Historical importance doesn't automatically translate to high property values."
Kedu ka mpaghara Canal si bụrụ na UNESCO mara ya dị ka saịtị ihe nketa ụwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mkpa akụkọ ihe mere eme na omenala ya**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that UNESCO listed the Canal Ring ""for its outstanding universal value from a historical and cultural perspective"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: O nwere àgwà pụrụ iche** - While true, the passage doesn't highlight *uniqueness* as the reason for UNESCO recognition.
*   **C: gburugburu ya, nke gụnyere Binnenstad** - The location is mentioned, but not as the primary reason for UNESCO status.
*   **D: Ihe onwunwe ahụ dị oke ọnụ** - Expensive properties are mentioned as a characteristic of the area, but not as a reason for being a World Heritage Site.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a, dị ka paragraf ahụ, kwadoro njem na Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **B: Na-agafe Angkor Pass**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Ngafe Angkọ bụ ebe a ga agaferịrị ịbanye ebe ofufe..."" (Angkor Pass is a place that must be passed to enter the shrine...). This means having an Angkor Pass is *required* for visiting Phnom Krom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyocha nke Tonle Sap (Inspection of Tonle Sap):** While the shrine overlooks Tonle Sap, the paragraph doesn't say inspecting the lake is necessary for the trip.
*   **C: Gaa na Siem Reap (Going to Siem Reap):** The shrine is near Siem Reap, but going *to* Siem Reap isn't a requirement for visiting Phnom Krom.
*   **D: Iji ụgbọ mmiri na-eleta ọdọ mmiri ahụ (Using a boat to visit the lake):** The paragraph mentions boat trips are available, but not that they are *required* to visit the shrine.

"Kedu ihe dị mkpa maka ndị njem ịbanye Phnom Krom, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: Nweta Angkor Pass**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngafe Angkọ bụ ebe a ga agaferịrị ịbanye ebe ofufe n'ihi nke a echefukwala iweta akwụkwọ akwụkwọ ngafe gị..."" which translates to ""The Angkor Pass is a place that must be passed to enter the shrine, so don't forget to bring your pass...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbe ụlọ nsọ Yasovarman gasịrị, na-arịgo:** This refers to the history of the temple, not a requirement for visitors.
*   **B: Njegharị Siem Reap:** While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, simply traveling *to* Siem Reap isn't a requirement to enter the shrine.
*   **D: Ikwọ ụgbọ mmiri n'akụkụ Tonle Sap:** While the text mentions boat trips, it doesn't say you *must* take one to enter, only that it's possible. It also mentions the pass is needed if going to Tonle Sap as well.

"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike igbochi onye njem nleta ịga Antarctica, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Na-emefu nnukwu ego na njem**.

Here's why:

The passage states that visiting Antarctica is ""very expensive."" This directly implies that the cost can be a barrier to entry for potential visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Otu ọchịchọ inyocha Oké Osimiri Ross:** The passage states that visits are often to the Ross Sea, implying people *want* to go there, not that a desire to do so would prevent a visit.
* **C: Nhazi ọrụ nke na-enye ohere njem na Disemba na Jenụwarị:** The passage states travel is *only* possible during Nov-Feb, so a tour in Dec/Jan wouldn't be a hindrance.
* **D: Enweghị ike ịgagharị gburugburu:** The passage doesn't mention physical limitations as a barrier, but rather the need for good physical health.



"
Kedu mpaghara Antarctica nke onye njem nlegharị anya nwere ike ịga leta?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmiri nnu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tourists are ""heavily concentrated on the Peninsula, Islands and Ross Sea region."" This directly refers to coastal areas and the sea – essentially, areas accessible by water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mpaghara ime obodo:** The passage mentions that specialized aerial experts sometimes go into the interior, but it's not a tourist area.
*   **C: Okpu:** The passage doesn't specify a location called “Okpu”.
*   **D: Ala ya:** While tourists are *on* land in Antarctica, the passage specifies they're concentrated on the Peninsula and islands (coastal areas). ""Ala ya"" is too general.



"
Ebee ka opekata mpe na a ga-achọta ebe nleba anya nke oge a?,"The correct answer is **B: N'ime obi obodo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that older observatories are now often found *within cities or on campuses*, making them more accessible. It contrasts this with modern telescopes being in remote, difficult-to-reach locations. This directly supports the idea that modern observatories are more likely to be found in central locations (i.e., within cities).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'ebe a na-erute ngwa ngwa:** While accessibility is mentioned, the passage focuses on *where* they are, not just that they are accessible.
*   **C: N'ebe dị anya:** The passage states that *modern* telescopes are in remote locations, but the question asks where modern observatories can be found.
*   **D: Na ụlọ akwụkwọ mahadum:** While older observatories *are* on campuses, the passage is discussing where *modern* telescopes are typically built.



"
Ebee ka teliskop nyocha nke oge a nwere ike ịnọ?,"The correct answer is **D: N'ime nnukwu ụlọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Otutu teliskop eji eme resaach n'oge ugbu a bu nnukwu ulo oru di n'ebe dipuru adipu nwere ezigbo ihu igwe.""  This directly translates to: ""Many telescopes used for research today are large buildings in remote locations with good weather.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na ụlọ ngosi nka** - The passage mentions older observatories *became* art galleries, not that modern ones are there.
*   **B: N'ụlọ akwụkwọ kọleji** - While some smaller telescopes might be on college campuses, the passage describes modern research telescopes as being in remote locations.
*   **C: Na webụsaịtị maka agụmakwụkwọ** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Kedu ebe ga-adị mma maka ụbọchị osimiri dị jụụ, dabere na ebe ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Tamaki Drive beaches (including St Heliers) are located in the Waitemata Harbour, within the thriving bays of residential areas like Mission Bay and St Heliers. It also mentions that these are often family-friendly beaches with a variety of shops along the long shoreline, and the swimming is good. This description aligns with a ""relaxed beach day.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ozi Bay** - This location isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: North Harbor Area** - While the North Shore beaches are mentioned, the text doesn't characterize them as particularly relaxing or family-friendly.
*   **D: Waitemata Harbour** - This is a larger geographical area and doesn't specifically pinpoint a good beach for a relaxed day. St Heliers is *within* the Waitemata Harbour.



"
"Ebee ka ọnọdụ igwu mmiri nwere ike bụrụ nke kacha dịrị nchebe, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Northern Beach beaches ""stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south"" and that they are generally sheltered, with many having shade provided by pohutukawa trees. This implies a safer swimming environment due to the shelter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: North Harbor region:** While the beaches *are* in the North Harbour region, the text doesn't specifically say they're the safest.
* **C: Southern Auckland suburbs:** The passage focuses on beaches in the northern areas.
* **D: Open ocean:** The passage states the beaches are sheltered, meaning they are *not* in the open ocean.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Emebila saịtị ahụ site n'ise akara maọbụ ịkanye grafiti n'ime ihe ndi owuwu."" (Do not deface the site with markings or graffiti within the structures).  This directly prohibits marking or defacing the site.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly addressed by the text:

*   **A: Ịdị oké njọ (Being mean):** While being disrespectful is generally inappropriate, the text doesn't *specifically* mention this.
*   **C: na-agwa njakịrị (Telling jokes):** The text specifically warns against making light of the Holocaust or Nazis, but doesn’t generally prohibit jokes.
*   **D: Ịkpụcha ụlọ (Vandalizing buildings):** The text focuses on *markings* and graffiti, not broader vandalism like destroying buildings.



"
Kedu nke kacha mma na-achịkọta asụsụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ewuru**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ụmụ asụsụ inyeaka bụ asụsụ nke **akamere** ma ọ bụ asụsụ ndị **ewuru** e kere...""  This translates to ""Auxiliary languages are languages that are *designed* or *constructed* created with the purpose...""

Therefore, ""ewuru"" (constructed) best describes how auxiliary languages are made.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ekepụtara** (developed) - While auxiliary languages *develop* over time, the passage focuses on their initial *construction*.
*   **B: Pụrụ iche** (unique) - This doesn't describe *how* they are made, but rather a potential *quality*.
*   **D: eke** (to count/number) - This is unrelated to language creation.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that auxiliary languages are *created* to *facilitate* communication *between* those with difficulty communicating.** This means they are designed to be neutral and helpful, not dominant or imposed.  They are not intended to *take over* existing languages.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Ha bụ asụsụ okike nke a na-eji kwalite nzikọrịta ozi n'etiti ndị nwere ike ọ gaghị enwe ike ịme ya** – This accurately reflects the passage's description of auxiliary languages.
* **B: Ha bụ asụsụ ndị a na-eme n'okike na asụsụ ndị e kere eke** –  The passage says they are ""created"" or ""constructed"" languages.
* **C: Emepụtara ha dị ka asụsụ iji kwado ọnọdụ nkwurịta okwu siri ike karị** – This is a restatement of the purpose of auxiliary languages explained in the passage.

"What should a passenger verify if their voyage is in the winter, per the passage?","The correct answer is **A: Ebe nke ụlọ** (The location of the cabin).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mgbe ị na-agafe Ebe ugwu Baltic n’oge oyi, lelee **ebe kabịn ahụ**..."" (When crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, check **the location of the cabin**...). This directly answers the question of what a passenger should verify during a winter voyage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ihe achọrọ Visa** (Visa requirements) - While the passage mentions visa requirements, it's in relation to who was *transported* on the voyage, not something a passenger needs to verify for *their own* trip.
*   **C: Okwu ndị ahụ** (The words) - This is irrelevant to the passage's advice.
*   **D: Ogologo oge ole ka ị nọrọ n'obodo** (How long you stay in the city) - The passage mentions time spent in the city, but doesn't state a passenger should *verify* this duration.

"Kedu ihe onye njem nwere ike ịzere na njem ụgbọ mmiri n'oge okpomọkụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Oge n'ime obodo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Njem nnyagharị nke Senti Piitasbọg gụnyere oge n'ime obodo."" (The Saint Petersburg migration included time within the city.)  The passage contrasts this with the dangers of the Baltic Sea crossing in winter. Therefore, avoiding time *in* the city (spending less time there) could be something a traveler might do to avoid the difficulties hinted at in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ịnyagharị ice (migrating ice):** The passage mentions ice as a danger in *winter*, not summer.
* **C: Ihe achọrọ Visa (Visa requirements):** The passage states people were *affected* by visa requirements, not that you could avoid them on a summer trip.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:**  The passage references Saint Petersburg as the destination of the migration, not something to avoid.

Kedu ihe kpatara akara na ọkwa na Catalan ji jupụta na Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụ asụsụ mbụ e nwere n’obodo ahụ** (It is the original language of the city).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Catalan has been reinforced by law as the language of the city."" This means Catalan has a historical and legally protected status as *the* language of Barcelona, even though many also understand and speak Spanish. This historical connection makes it the reason for the prominence of Catalan signage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E jiri ya tụnyere Spanish, a na-aghọtakarị ya** (It is more widely understood than Spanish): The passage says almost half *try* to speak Catalan, but more people *understand* it. It also states everyone knows Spanish. So, Catalan isn't more widely understood.
*   **C: Na Barcelona, a-asụkarị ya** (It is more spoken in Barcelona): While many speak it, the passage doesn't claim it's spoken *more* than Spanish.
*   **D: Ọtụtụ ndị na-eji Metro na ebe ọha ndị ọzọ na-asụ Catalan** (Many people using the Metro and other public places speak Catalan): The passage states announcements are in Catalan *despite* the automated systems offering many other languages. This indicates the announcements *aren't* primarily for Catalan speakers.



"
A na-eme mkpọsa ugboro ugboro nke sistemu Metro Barcelona n'ime asụsụ ndị a?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A na-ama ọkwa mgbedum na Metro naanị na asụsụ Catalan..."" which translates to ""Announcements on the Metro are only made in Catalan...""

While the system *also* announces things in other languages via automated systems, the *primary* and officially stated language for Metro announcements is Catalan. Therefore, the answer is Catalan."
Kedu n'ime ihe eji enyere ndụ aka na-agaghị abụ ihe kacha mkpa maka akwa akwa na nri ụtụtụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Wi-Fi ọsọ ọsọ**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *experience* of a B&B, emphasizing things like a hearty breakfast, unique amenities, and a beautiful, character-filled building. It highlights the importance of quality bedding and breakfast offerings. While Wi-Fi is useful, it isn't mentioned as a key component of what makes a B&B special and is far less important than the core offerings of comfort (bedding) and food (breakfast).

Let's look at why the other options are more relevant:

*   **A: Ọpụrụiche ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ (Unique dining options)** - The passage *specifically* mentions breakfast as a key component, and highlights local or host-specific offerings.
*   **B: Ngwá ụlọ mere nke oge ochie pụrụ iche (Unique antique furnishings)** - The passage mentions antique furnishings as adding character to the room.
*   **C: Nke ọma na-edebe mpụta ebe (Well-maintained grounds)** - The passage mentions well-kept grounds and a swimming pool as desirable features.

Here's why:

The passage states that a good breakfast *could* include local delicacies or the host's specialties, but it doesn't present locally produced food and drink as a *key* competitive factor between high-end B&Bs.  The passage focuses on the quality of the bed linens, towels, and breakfast itself (being substantial and well-presented) as the main areas of competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nhazi nke oge a (Modern amenities)** - The passage mentions ""high-end B&Bs"" and implies a certain level of comfort and quality, which would include modern amenities.
*   **B: Nhọrọ nri ụtụtụ nke oge dị iche iche (Varied breakfast choices)** - The passage directly states breakfast is important and can include special offerings.
*   **C: akwa akwa (High-quality linens)** - The passage *explicitly* highlights the importance of high-quality linens and towels as a key competitive factor.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states that the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as indoor ice events, will be held in Beijing. It also specifically says that *other* snow events will be held at the Taizicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou, which is *not* in Beijing. Therefore, events at Taizicheng are the ones *not* taking place in Beijing.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mmalite emume** - The paragraph says the opening ceremony will be in Beijing.
*   **C: Ememe ikpeazụ** - The paragraph says the closing ceremony will be in Beijing.
*   **D: Asọmpi ice emere n'ime** - The paragraph says indoor ice events will be in Beijing."
"Kedu n'ime mmemme ndị a ka Beijing ga-anabata na 2022, dị ka ekwuru n'akụkụ a?","The correct answer is **B: Asọmpi ice na-eme n'ime**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Beijing ga-eme mmemme mmeghe na mmechi ya na ihe omume ais nke ime ụlọ"" which translates to ""Beijing will host its opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice events"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Egwuregwu Olympic n'oge okpomọkụ** - The passage focuses on the Winter Olympics.
*   **C: Egwuregwu oyi** - While it's about the Winter Olympics, the passage doesn’t state Beijing will host *all* ice/snow sports, some are in Zhangjiakou.
*   **D: Mmechi mmechi** - While Beijing *will* host the closing ceremony, the passage says it will host the ceremonies *and* indoor ice events, making B the more comprehensive answer.

The passage states: ""Ndị ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ etinyela ndị ọrụ ọkụkọ n'ọrụ, mana obere ihe ize ndụ dịịrị ndị na eledo nnụnụ anya."" 

This translates to: ""So far, the cases have mainly involved poultry workers, but there is a low risk for those who watch birds.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị na-ekiri nnụnụ (People who watch birds):** The passage specifically states the risk is *low* for this group.
*   **B: ndị na-emeso anụmanụ (People who handle animals):** While bird flu *can* affect animals, the passage focuses on poultry workers.
*   **D: Ndị nweburu ọrịa (People who are sick):** The passage doesn't suggest people who are already sick are more susceptible to contracting bird flu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọrịa flu bụ naanị ndị ọrụ ọkụkọ.** The passage says workers are *more likely* to be affected, not that it *only* affects them.
* **B: N'iji ya tụnyere nnụnụ, e depụtala ụmụ mmadụ ọtụtụ ihe atụ.** The passage states the opposite – far fewer cases have been reported in humans.

Here's why:

The text states: ""The White Sea-Baltic waterway connected the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea..."" This directly links the Arctic Ocean (often referred to as the Polar Ocean) and the Baltic Sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oké Osimiri Ojii na Oké Osimiri Caspian:** While the Vikings *used* Russian waterways to reach these seas, the White Sea-Baltic waterway doesn't directly connect them.
*   **B: Ọdọ Mmiri Onega na Osimiri Volga:** These are part of the network, but not the main connection the waterway provides.
*   **D: Southern Ocean and Red Sea:** This is not mentioned in the text and is geographically irrelevant.

( ""...in a sleeping overnight train, the train conductor may take your travel permit so as not to bother you while you sleep."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ụgbọ elu** (Airplane) - The passage mentions border control/checking at airports, but not needing a permit *while* travelling.
* **B: Onye na-ehi ụra na-azụ ụgbọ n'abalị** (Someone sleeping while riding a night train) - This is a description of a traveler, not a type of vehicle.
* **C: Ụgbọ mmiri** (Ship) -  The passage mentions border control/checking at ships, but not needing a permit *while* travelling.

This translates to ""Sometimes trains crossing international borders are checked when they disembark, which means you should keep your identification handy when getting off the train.""

This directly implies ID checks happen **after** getting off the train.

"Mgbe ị na-aga na oke okpomọkụ nke Singapore, olee nsogbu ndị a nwere ike ime?","The correct answer is **C: ike ọgwụgwụ n'ihi okpomọkụ** (Weakness due to heat).

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly mentions the intense heat of Singapore and the need for only a few degrees of elevation to find relief. It describes the heat as being strong and capable of causing discomfort.  This directly translates to the possibility of feeling weak or exhausted *because of* the heat.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Izu gị ohi** (You get lost) - The passage doesn't mention getting lost.
*   **B: Enweghi ụlọahịa ruru aka** (No accessible shops) - The passage focuses on temperature, not shopping availability.
*   **D: Na-efunahụ ntụziaka** (Losing direction) - Similar to A, the passage doesn't mention directional problems.



"
Kedu onye ga-achọ ịnọpụ na pastries German?,"The correct answer is **B: onye na-amasị decadent emeso**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes German pastries as delicious, diverse, and often paired with strong coffee.** It highlights the richness of ingredients like almonds, hazelnuts, and fruits, and mentions both cakes and filled pastries. This all points to a treat for someone who enjoys indulgent, decadent desserts.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: onye nwere ihe nfụkasị ahụ siri ike:** The passage doesn't mention anything about allergies.
    * **C: onye na-anabata chocolate:** While some German pastries *might* contain chocolate, it's not a central theme of the description.

Kedu akụkụ nke pastries German na-ewere dị ka ihe na-eme n'oge?,"The correct answer is **C: Plum**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...cherries and **plums** are used to make pies during the summer."" This directly identifies plums as a seasonal ingredient in German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apples** - While apples are used ""throughout the year,"" the passage doesn't specify them as *seasonal*.
*   **B: Hazelnuts** - Hazelnuts are mentioned as an ingredient in many pastries, but not specifically tied to a time of year.

The passage specifically states that the advice is for those who are willing to sacrifice ""comfort, time, and people they know"" to be able to travel on a low budget, ""simply as a matter of principle."" This aligns directly with someone who is motivated by the *idea* of travel and the experience itself, even if it means hardship – a person driven by wanderlust or seeing the world as a matter of principle (""ihe ịma aka"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: onye na-adịghị mmachi oge** - While sacrificing time is mentioned, it's not the primary motivator.
*   **C: Onye bu n'obi na-arụ ọrụ remotely ka ọ nọ n'ụzọ** - The passage doesn’t mention remote work as a means to travel cheaply.
*   **D: Onye na-ahụ n'anya ịhazi usoro ihe omume ha** - This relates to planning, not necessarily a drive for extreme budget travel.

Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara njem n'etiti Point Marion na Fairmont bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **D: O kwesịghị ịbụ nsogbu iji ekwentị**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""cell phone service is strong here compared to many other long routes, such as Pennsylvania Turnpike."" This directly contradicts the statement that it *should* be a problem to use a phone.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Ogologo okporo ụzọ ime obodo ndị zoro ezo dị** - The passage mentions ""winding roads"" and going through ""remote, heavily wooded terrain.""
*   **B: Ụzọ dị warara** - The passage states ""narrow roads.""
*   **C: Ọ na-adịkarịghị agbaso mmachi ọsọ** - The passage mentions ""speed limits posted are often lower than expected"" and speed limits are typically 35-40 mph.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kwesịrị ịbụ ihe kacha mkpa maka ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala n'okporo ụzọ Buffalo-Pittsburgh, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Na-eme ngwa ngwa, ntụgharị dị nkọ** (Fast speeds, sharp turns).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the road between Point Marion and Fairmont is the ""most winding stretch"" of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, with ""twisting roads"" and ""sharp curves."" It also mentions speed limits are lower (35-40 mph) because of these conditions, suggesting drivers need to be particularly careful with speed and maneuvering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-eme ka okporo ụzọ kwụsịlata** (Road closures) - The passage doesn't mention any road closures.
*   **B: Mkpuchi ekwentị ezughi oke** (Poor cell coverage) - While the passage *does* state that cell service is surprisingly *strong* on this stretch, not poor.
*   **D: Owuwu okporo ụzọ ugboro ugboro** (Frequent road construction) - The passage doesn't mention construction.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị eme tupu ịmalite ịkwọ ụgbọ mmiri?,"The correct answer is **D: Obere ntụziaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoneering requires ""little physical fitness or athletic ability to start."" This directly contrasts with needing extensive training or athletic prowess. Options A, B, and C (swimming ability, good health, and climbing skills) are all things that *would* be helpful or necessary for other adventure sports mentioned in the passage but are *not* required to start canyoneering. The passage specifically points out it doesn't demand a lot of pre-existing skill. Therefore, the one thing you wouldn't necessarily need before starting is extensive training - just ""little instruction."""
"Maka njem nlegharị anya nke ọma, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka a ga-achọ?","The correct answer is **C: Nzere ntozu na canyoneering**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""chọtụ obere ọzụzụ ma ọ bụ ọdịdị mma nke anụ ahụ imalite (n'ịtụnyere ịrị elu okwute, iji skuba amanye na mmiri maọbụ ime skii ugwu, maka ọmụmaatụ)."" This implies that while basic fitness is helpful, specific training – canyoneering certification – is likely needed for a *safe* and successful trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inwe ikike egwuregwu dị elu (High level of athletic ability):** While helpful, the passage specifically contrasts canyoneering with activities *requiring* a high level of athleticism.
* **B: Maka njem nlegharị anya nke ọma, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka a ga-achọ (For a successful trip, what is required?):** This is a repeat of the question, not an answer.
* **D: Ikike igwu mmiri (Swimming ability):** The passage mentions canyoneering incorporates swimming, but doesn't indicate it's the *only* or primary requirement for a safe trip.

"Kedu ihe ga-abara onye ọ bụla na-ejikere ịkwa ụlọikwuu n'ụgbọala ha, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Imara oke ụgbọ ala gị nke ọma**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iwube ụlọikwuu n’ala mmadụ ma ọ bụ n’ime otu obodo nwere nha ọ bụla nwere ike ịdọta na mfe anya a na-achọghị. Na mkpirisi, njem na aka mma n'ụgbọala nke onwe n'ihi na ya onwe ya bụ ụdị """"njem nnọgharị"""". "" This translates to understanding the limits of your vehicle making ""wandering trips"" possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ugbọ ala nke nwere oche mpịachi** - The passage mentions reclining seats as a *possibility* for larger vehicles, but it’s not the key takeaway for someone wanting to ""wander.""
*   **C: Ụlọ ntu** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ebe maa ụlọikwuu na ala nkeonwe** - While the passage mentions parking, it's not the core idea about what allows for a ""wandering trip.""

"Kedu ihe ndị na-ama ụlọikwuu ga-achọ izere ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ka a ghara ịhụ ha, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Inya ụgbọ ala ma ọ bụ ụgbọ ala buru ibu, dị ka SUV ma ọ bụ minivan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Iwube ụlọikwuu n’ala mmadụ ma ọ bụ n’ime otu obodo nwere nha ọ bụla nwere ike ịdọta na mfe anya a na-achọghị.""  It then contrasts this with smaller vehicles: ""N'adịghị ka nnukwu ụgbọ ndị ọzọ, ịnya ụgbọ ala gị nwere ike ọ maala gị ahụ.""

This directly implies that larger, more noticeable vehicles (like SUVs or minivans) are *more likely* to attract unwanted attention, and therefore should be avoided by those who want to remain unseen.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This is just restating the question.
* **C:** While hiding a safe in a public or private location is a general security concept, the passage doesn't specifically discuss *where* to hide it, but rather *how* to travel without being noticed.
* **D:** The passage focuses on the *vehicle* as drawing attention, not on a lack of knowledge about operating it.

"Ònye wuru Casablanca nke ugboro abụọ, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Na Portugal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndị Pọtụgaalụ bibiri ya ma rụgharịa ya n’okpuru aha Casa Branca..."" (The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca...). This clearly indicates the Portuguese rebuilt Casablanca.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị ahịa si Spain:** The text mentions Spanish traders *named* the city Casablanca, but doesn't say they rebuilt it.
*   **C: Ndị merenids:** The Merenids used Anfa (the previous name of Casablanca) as a port, but didn't rebuild it according to the text.
*   **D: Onye na-achị Morocco, sultan:** The sultan rebuilt the city *after* the Portuguese left, but wasn't the original builder of the city after it was destroyed."
"Mgbe ọdachi dakwasịrị, ònye hapụrụ Casablanca ka ọ dị taa?","The correct answer is **B: Na Portugal**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after a devastating earthquake in 1755."" This directly indicates that the Portuguese left Casablanca after the earthquake.

"Kedu ka Sintra siri bụrụ ihe ama ama na ndị njem nlegharị anya si mba ofesi, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ezi reviews nke Lord Byron** (Good reviews by Lord Byron).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...aka-ugwu ma gburu-gburu dikwa nso igaru di obodo ihunanya na itunanya Sintra bukwa nke emere amara-amara nye ndi mba-ozo ka akowaputara idi-ukwu ya n’uzo egbuke-egbuke site na-aka Onye-nwe Byro."" 

This translates to: ""...the mountain and the surrounding area also passed near the beloved and praised town of Sintra, which was made famous to foreigners with enthusiastic praise from Lord Byron.""

Therefore, Lord Byron's positive reviews are specifically credited with making Sintra famous to tourists.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Port nke Roca** (Port of Roca) - Cabo da Roca is mentioned as a stop on a bus route *to* Sintra, not as a reason for Sintra's fame.
*   **B: Odịdị nke Meri** (Appearance of Mary) - While Fatima is mentioned, the passage does *not* link Mary's appearances to Sintra's fame.
*   **D: Ọ bụ ịhụnanya nke akụkọ ihe mere eme** (It is the love of historical stories) - The passage doesn't state this as the reason for Sintra's fame. It highlights Byron's praise."
Kedu ihe Armenia anaghị anabata?,"The correct answer is **D: Na mba ọhụrụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""onweghị mba guzobere onwe ya - ọbụghị ma mba Amenia - nabatara ya"" (no country, not even Armenia, recognized it). This refers to the self-declared Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) after the war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mpaghara Nagorno-Karabakh:** Armenia doesn't *not accept* the *territory* itself, but the *independence* of the region.
*   **B: Esemokwu na ndị Azeris:** The passage mentions conflict but doesn't say Armenia doesn't accept that conflict exists.
*   **C: Arụmụka na mgbakwasị ụkwụ diplomatic si Azerbaijan:** While there are diplomatic issues, the main point is the lack of recognition of the state.



"
Kedu ihe ka na-emetụta mmekọrịta Azerbaijan na Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Mpaghara nke Nagorno-Karabakh** (The region of Nagorno-Karabakh).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""disputes over territory continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan."" This territory is specifically identified as Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị bi na Azerbaijan bụ ndị Armenia** (People in Azerbaijan are Armenians): This is not mentioned in the passage and is factually inaccurate.
*   **B: Esemokwu nke 1994** (The conflict of 1994): While the 1994 conflict is *part* of the issue, the passage says the *dispute over territory* resulting from it is what continues to affect relations.
*   **C: Arụmụka mkparita uka** (Negotiation arguments): The passage mentions a dispute, but not specifically arguments within negotiations. The core problem is the territory itself.



"
Kedu ihe nwere ike ịkpata ego ọzọ mgbe ị na-enweta taksi na Charlotte?,"The correct answer is **B: inwe mmadụ atọ mụ na ya nọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Enwere ụgwọ mgbakwunye dịịrị ibukarị ndị nje abụọ, ya mere nhọrọ nke a nwere ike ịdị ọnụ karịa ka okwesiri."" This directly translates to ""There is a surcharge for carrying two passengers, so this option can be more expensive than necessary."" Therefore, having three people (two passengers plus yourself) will incur an extra charge, making the taxi ride more expensive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibi ebe ozo** - The passage doesn't mention location affecting taxi fares.
*   **C: Ịhapụ Ogbe Ndịda** - The passage does not mention this.
*   **D: Ibụ ezigbo ezinụlọ** - The passage discusses family-friendly options but doesn't link family status to taxi costs."
"Kedu ihe a ga-ele anya dị ka ihe ndọghachi azụ nke ịzụ ụmụaka na Charlotte, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ugwọ ụlọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Enwere ụgwọ mgbakwunye dịịrị ibukarị ndị nje abụọ, ya mere nhọrọ nke a nwere ike ịdị ọnụ karịa ka okwesiri."" This directly translates to ""There is a supplement for carrying two children, so this option can be more expensive than it should be.""  This describes a financial drawback (high costs) related to raising children in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iji ụgbọ ala** - The passage mentions taxis, but not as a drawback, rather as something families *don't* usually need.
*   **C: Ndị si mpaghara ndị ọzọ** - The passage highlights people *moving to* Charlotte, not the negative impact of people from other areas.
*   **D: Achọ ịbata n'ime obodo** - The passage doesn't mention difficulty with moving *into* the city. It focuses on why people are attracted to it.



"
Onye chịrị mpaghara ugwu Chile tupu ndị Spen abịarute?,"The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""When the Spanish arrived in the sixteenth century, the mountainous region of Chile was under Inca rule..."" This directly answers the question of who ruled the northern part of Chile before the Spanish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapuche** - The passage states the Mapuche lived in *central and southern* Chile, not the northern mountainous region.
*   **B: Ndị Amerịka** - This is too broad. While the Incas and Mapuche are Indigenous American peoples, the question asks about a specific group.
*   **C: Ndị Araucan** - This is another name for the Mapuche people, and they didn't rule the northern region.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emeghị na 1810, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Chileke chịriri ndị Spen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Chile declared independence in 1810, *actual* victory against the Spanish wasn't achieved until 1818.  This means Chile didn't defeat the Spanish in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ nweghị gọọmentị etiti nwere:** The passage says Spain lacked a central government in 1810 due to the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **C: A lụrụ agha n'oge ọchịchị Napoleon:** The passage mentions the Napoleonic Wars as a context for Spain's instability.
*   **D: A kpọsaara otu Chileke:** The passage states Chile *declared* independence in 1810.



"
Kedu ka obodo ndị dị anya na Liguria si enweta ndị njem?,"The correct answer is **C: Ugbọ okporo ígwè ma ọ bụ ụgbọ mmiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Okporo ụzọ, ụgbọ oloko na ụgbọ mmiri jikọrọ obodo ndị dị na ya."" This directly tells us that trains and boats are used to connect the towns.  While cars can't go *into* the towns, people can access them via these methods.



"
"""Gịnị ka okwu Italian bụ """"Cinque Terre"""" pụtara?""","The correct answer is **A: Obodo ise**.

The passage states: ""Sinque Terre, nke pụtara Ala Ise..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands..."" ""Cinque"" means five, and ""Terre"" means lands, therefore it means Five Lands/Five Villages/Five Towns.

"Kedu ụdị akpụkpọ ụkwụ, dị ka ederede, kwesịrị ekwesị maka ọnọdụ oyi na-adịghị mma?","The correct answer is **C: Akpụkpọ ụkwụ nwere ikiri ụkwụ dị ịrịba ama**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Akpụkpọ ụkwụ sọma na-amịkarị amị nke ukwuu n'elu aịs na sno, ma ụfọdụ akpụkpọ ụkwụ wịnta agaghị adị mma."" This means soles that provide good grip are important for icy conditions.  ""Ikiri akpụkpọ ụkwụ kwesịrị ịdị ala ma saa asaa"" further supports this, suggesting textured, grippy soles are best.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akpụkpọ ụkwụ nwere obere ikiri ụkwụ** - The text implies the opposite – deeper tread is better.
*   **B: Akpụkpọ ụkwụ sock na ihe ịchọ mma** -  This isn't relevant to grip in icy conditions.
*   **D: Na-enweghị 1/5 inch miri emi imewe, akpụkpọ ụkwụ** - The text specifically states that the tread depth *should* be at least 5mm (1/5 inch) for good performance in winter.



"
Kedu n'ime ndị a na-agaghị enye aka n'ịkwalite njide n'okporo ụzọ na-amị amị n'oge oyi?,"The correct answer is **D: Mmiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states that salt, sand, and calcium chloride (a type of salt) are used to *reduce* the slickness of roads. Water, however, *contributes* to the ice and snow that cause slickness. Therefore, water would not help improve grip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nnu** - The passage specifically mentions salt as a way to reduce slickness and improve traction.
*   **B: Ajịrịja nkume** - The passage mentions sand is used to reduce slickness.
*   **C: Aja** - The passage states that sand is commonly used to reduce the slickness of roads.



"
Kedu nkwupụta gbasara myirịta Hawaii na Cook Islands bụ eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha nọ na mpaghara oge yiri nke ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""They formed at roughly the same time as Hawaii, therefore sometimes the islands are thought of as 'Hawaii sunk below'."" This implies a shared geological history and similar positioning, which often correlates with similar time zones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha abụọ nwere ọnụ ọgụgụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ** - The passage specifically mentions that Cook Islands *lack* large hotels and the development common in tourist destinations, implying fewer dining options than Hawaii.
*   **B: O nweghị ọchịchị dịịrị otu n'ime ha** - The passage states Cook Islands is a self-governing nation *in free association with New Zealand*, meaning it *does* have a form of governance.
*   **D: Enweghị obodo maka nke ọ bụla n'ime ha** - The passage states the Cook Islands *do not have cities*, but Hawaii does. This makes the statement incorrect for both.



"
Kedu otu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụ otu agwaetiti**.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states: ""Ha no n’otu oge ka Hawaii, ya mere na oge ufodu ana eche maka agwaetiti ndi a ka ha bu “Hawaii gbadara n’okpuru”. Agwaetiti Osi nri ndị ahụ enweghị obodo ọ bụla mana ọ bụ agwaetiti dị iche iche iri na ise mejupụtara ya."" (They formed at the same time as Hawaii, so sometimes these islands are thought of as “Hawaii sunk below”. The Cook Islands has no cities but is made up of fifteen diverse islands.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: O pere mpe karịa Hawaii** - The text implies this by calling them ""smaller"" and referring to them as ""Hawaii sunk below"".
*   **C: Rarotonga na Aitutaki bụ isi obodo** - The text states: ""Ndị isi ha bụ Rarotonga na Aitutaki."" (Their leaders are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.)
*   **D: Ọ bụ n'otu oge mpaghara obodo agwaetiti Hawaii** - The text states: ""Ha no n’otu oge ka Hawaii..."" (They formed at the same time as Hawaii...)



"
Kedu n'ime ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ndị a na-enye ụdị ebe obibi abụọ dị iche iche?,"The correct answer is **A: Siren**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena is a ranger station that provides both lodging and food.""  The other locations (La Leona, San Pedrilo, and Lós Patos) *only* provide lodging, not food. Therefore, Siren is the only one offering both."
"Ebee ka ị ga-edobe akwụkwọ ikike ogige, dị ka paragraf si dị, ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọghị iji kredit kwụọ ụgwọ?","The correct answer is **A: Siren**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""You must have a permit if you are going to spend the night at Sirena."" This means Sirena is the place where a permit (akwụkwọ ikike ogige) is required. The question asks where you'd need the permit if you don't want to use a credit card - the text doesn't connect credit card usage to permit locations, only to motorcycle rentals at Puerto Jimenez. Therefore, the permit is needed for Sirena regardless of payment method."
"Kedu ụdị ski a na-eme na mbara ala dị steepụ, dịka ọ dị na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Ejiji Alpine**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""njem mfe ski""** as similar to hiking, and often *not* involving steep, prepared slopes. This eliminates options A (skiing and hiking) and D (backcountry skiing) which implies more rugged terrain.
* **The passage specifically contrasts the described ski activity with ""egwuregwu ịrị elu ugwu""** which is done on *steep*, groomed slopes and requires specialized equipment.  ""Ejiji Alpine"" (Alpine skiing) *is* the sport of skiing on those steep, groomed slopes.
* **""Skiing n'ime ime obodo""** (B) is too broad and doesn't necessarily mean steep slopes; it could refer to the easier form of skiing described in the passage.



"
"Kedu ihe nwere ike inyere ndị na-agba ọsọ azụ azụ aka na-achọ ime ngwa ngwa karịa, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Ezi ọnọdụ**.

Here's why:

The passage compares cross-country skiing to hiking. It states that in good conditions, you can cover more ground skiing than hiking *without a backpack*. This implies that being in good physical condition (being ""in shape"") allows you to take advantage of the efficiency of skiing and go faster.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oke akpụkpọ ụkwụ:** While strong legs are helpful for skiing, the passage focuses on *covering distance efficiently*, not necessarily power.
*   **B: Nnukwu akpa nke ngwa:** The passage explicitly states that skiers often travel *without* heavy backpacks, suggesting that carrying extra weight hinders speed.
*   **D: Egwu rhythmic:** While rhythm might be part of good skiing technique, the passage doesn't link it directly to increased speed.

**Therefore, ""ezi ọnọdụ"" (good condition/shape) is the most logical answer based on the information provided in the passage.**"
Kedu ihe na-esiri ndị njem na-enwe ujo nbanye ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Na-alaghachi n'ọdịbendị ha si malite**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that returning home after being abroad can be difficult.  You've learned new customs and may have *lost* aspects of your original culture.  The passage points out people are understanding of travelers adjusting to a new culture, but *don't* necessarily expect the same patience when returning home. This makes re-adjusting to one’s original culture surprisingly difficult and a source of potential culture shock.

Let’s look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịmara omenala ebe ọhụrụ ahụ (Knowing the new culture):** The passage suggests familiarity with a new culture doesn't prevent readjustment difficulties.
*   **B: Njikere ichere na inwe ọmịiko (Willingness to wait and have compassion):** This is what others *offer* to travelers, not what travelers struggle with.
*   **C: Njem mba ofesi (Foreign travel):** Travel itself isn’t the source of difficulty, it's the *return* from travel.



"
"Kedu ụdị njem nlegharị anya nwere ike nweta ujo nbanye ọzọ n'ike karịa, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị njem nwere oke ujo omenala siri ike**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mmenyeụjọ mbanyegharị abia na nkpirikpi karia mmenyeụjọ omenala (enwere agba họnịịmuunu dịtụ ntakịrị)..."" This directly says that culture shock *upon returning home* is often stronger than the initial culture shock experienced when first arriving in a new place.  People with strong cultural ties (and therefore more initial culture shock) are likely to experience the reverse culture shock more intensely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndị na-eme njem ma biri ná mba ọzọ wee mee mgbanwe ngwa ngwa:** Those who adapt quickly would likely *not* have as much reverse culture shock.
* **C: Ndị njem na-ahapụbeghị ezumike ezumike ha:** This is irrelevant to the concept of reverse culture shock.
* **D: Ndị njem na-enweghị ndidi:** While patience is mentioned in the passage, it's about how *others* react to travelers, not a characteristic of someone prone to reverse culture shock.



"
Kedu ihe ndị mmadụ kwesịrị izere ime anụ ọhịa?,"The correct answer is **A: Enweghị ọnụnọ ha** (Avoid approaching them).

Here's why:

The passage states that people may get too close to moose because they don't see them as dangerous. It emphasizes the danger of this proximity. Therefore, the best way to avoid danger with wild animals like moose is to avoid approaching them altogether.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: M na-eji nwayọọ na-arịgo** (I am walking slowly) - While being cautious is good, it doesn't necessarily prevent danger if you're still too close.
*   **C: Na-eweda mmerụ ahụ nwere ike ime ha** (Giving injuries that could harm them) - This is irrelevant to human safety.
*   **D: Site n'ebe dị anya na-ahụ ha** (Seeing them from afar) - This is a good practice, but the main point is to *avoid approaching* in the first place.



"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara moose na-akwadoghị?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha bụ ndị e kere eke na-emegide ibe ha** (They are aggressive and confrontational towards others).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states moose generally avoid conflict.** It says they ""do not actively seek confrontation"" but *will* defend themselves when threatened. This directly contradicts the idea they are aggressive and confrontational.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

*   **B: Mgbe ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ anaghị ahụ ha dị ka ihe iyi egwu nwere ike ime** (Sometimes people don't see them as dangerous animals they can be) - The passage explicitly says people might underestimate their danger.
*   **C: Onye ọ bụla nọ nso nwere ike ịtọlite ha** (Anyone nearby can provoke them) - This aligns with the idea that approaching too closely can lead to a defensive reaction.
*   **D: Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mkpa, ha ga-echebe onwe ha** (If necessary, they will defend themselves) - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a ga-adị ntakịrị ihe ize ndụ maka onye na-awagharị n'ọzara, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Na-egbu oge na mgbalị na mirage**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ihe ndị a nwere ike ịgbawa obi ma onye njem gaa chụwa ihe efu a, na-emefusi ike a ga-eji eme ihe dị mkpa, ya na mmiri fọrọ afọ."" This directly links chasing a mirage to a dangerous outcome – wasting vital energy and water.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly hazardous based on the passage:

* **A: Abalị na-enweghị ezuru ọkụ gia** - The passage mentions hypothermia as a risk, but only *if you don't have warm clothes*. It's a potential danger, but not as immediate as chasing a mirage.
* **B: Na-ekiri a mirage nke yiri mmiri** - Simply *seeing* a mirage isn't dangerous. It's the *chasing* that's the problem.
* **D: Iji mmiri eme ihe n'ụzọ na-adịghị arụ ọrụ iji chụọ ube** - While wasting water is bad, the passage focuses on the energy expenditure from chasing the mirage as the primary threat.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị ekwe omume maka ndị njem ọzara?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmiri dị ala**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The passage specifically mentions mirages, hypothermia, and extreme heat (which can lead to dehydration, a form of ""death from thirst"") as dangers faced by desert travelers.
*   **Mmiri dị ala (Lack of water):** The passage talks about wasting precious water chasing mirages, implying a *shortage* of water is the problem, not an abundance (or ""low"" water). In the desert, water scarcity is a defining characteristic and a major danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mirages:** The passage *directly* discusses mirages as a deceptive phenomenon in the desert.
*   **C: Hypothermia:** The passage *directly* mentions hypothermia as a risk due to cold desert nights.
*   **D: Ọnwụ anwụ (Death from thirst):** The passage implies this is a danger when discussing wasting water and the harsh conditions.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…onye mmeri ndị Spain belatara nke ukwuu onu ogugu ndi mmadu nke Tainos… ndị mmeri Ndị Spen gburu ihe dị ka Ndị Taínos 100,000."" This directly links a significant population change (a decline in numbers) to the arrival of the Spanish and specifically mentions the Taíno people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị Haiti** - The passage mentions Haiti as sharing the island but doesn't discuss a population shift *among them* in relation to the Spanish arrival.
*   **B: Nke Caribbean** - This is too broad; the passage is specific about the Taíno.
*   **D: Ọ bụ Spanish** - The Spanish *caused* the population change, but they weren't the population that changed in numbers.

Kedu onye ga-ata ụta maka ịrị elu na-ewu ewu nke skiing dị ka ihe egwuregwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị Nordic**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""n’ime 1861 òtù egwuregwu skii ntụrụndụ nke mbụ bụ nke emepere site n’aka Ndị Nọọwei n’ime Ọstrelịa."" (In 1861 the first recreational ski competition was created by the Norwegians in Australia). Norwegians are a Nordic people. This indicates that the *Norwegians/Nordic people* were instrumental in developing skiing as a recreational sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Egwuregwu ski:** This is the sport itself, not who popularized it.
*   **C: Ibi n'ọgba:** This refers to early depictions of skiing, not the rise in its popularity as a sport.
*   **D: Ha bụ ndị Australia:** While the first competition was *in* Australia, it was created by Norwegians, not Australians.



"
Kedu afọ mbụ a kpọtụrụ skiing dị ka egwuregwu na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: N'afọ 1861**.

The passage states: ""n’ime 1861 òtù egwuregwu skii ntụrụndụ nke mbụ bụ nke emepere site n’aka Ndị Nọọwei n’ime Ọstrelịa."" This directly answers the question.

Gịnị na-ejikọta ya na àgwàetiti kasị ukwuu nke dị n'ụsọ oké osimiri nke ebe ọwụwa anyanwụ Africa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ihe nketa Europe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that European powers began colonizing the region in the 15th century, starting with Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route. It also mentions French holdings and resort areas. This clearly indicates a connection to European influence and history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ozizi Islam:** While Islam is present (mentioned with the Arab influence and acceptance in Comoros and Mayotte), it's not the primary thing *connecting* the islands.
*   **C: Anụ ọhịa:** The passage mentions the biodiversity but doesn't state it's a connecting factor between the islands.
*   **D: Okomoko ntụrụndụ:** The resorts are a result of the European influence, not a central connecting theme.



"
Kedu akụkụ nke obere agwaetiti dị n'Ebe Ọwụwa Anyanwụ Africa na-enweghị? ,"The correct answer is **A: Mmekọrịta na France**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ọtụtụ agwaetiti ndị ka obere bụ mba ndị kwụụrụ onwe ha, **maọbụ nọrọ na njiko ha na France**..."" This directly indicates that some of the smaller islands *do* have a relationship with France (are in its colonies). Therefore, the question is asking which attribute these islands *don't* universally have, and it's independence from France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Otụtụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ:** The passage doesn't mention restaurants.
*   **C: Aha ọma anụ ọhịa:** The passage states the region is rich in wildlife.
*   **D: Mmekọrịta-nnwere onwe na obodo ndị ọzọ:** The passage states many are independent nations.

This translates to: ""Many ancient churches often held an Easter vigil on Holy Saturday during the end of Holy Week, where congregations would enter into ceremony as two o’clock in the midnight struck to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-eme ememe ọmụmụ** - The text mentions it *might* be a pre-Christian fertility rite, but doesn't state the churches *did* this.
*   **C: Na-eme atụmatụ oriri na ọṅụṅụ obodo** - The text doesn't mention anything about feasts or drink.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Akwụkwọ njem kennabata n'obodo ị na-aga dị mkpa igosipụta ogo ị ga-anọ."" This translates to ""A return ticket to the country you are going to is necessary to demonstrate the length of your stay."" This directly corresponds to option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aspọtụ dị irè maka ọnwa 6 ka ụbọchị njem gachara** - The passage doesn't mention a 6-month visa validity requirement.
*   **B: Akwụkwọ ozi ịkpọ òkù gọọmentị** - The passage doesn't mention a government call-up letter.
*   **D: Akwụkwọ ndụ akwụkwọ ndụ si US** - While the passage *does* mention US resident card holders need to get authorization, it doesn't say a US resident card *is* the requirement for entry, just a step for those who have one.

Kedu ebumnuche nke iwu njem Ecuador na-abụghị maka ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Na-amachi ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị njem dị ka o kwere mee** (Controlling the number of travelers as much as possible).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on requiring Cubans to obtain entry permits.** This is a direct measure to *control* who enters Ecuador and therefore limits the *number* of travelers. The entire passage describes a process of vetting and approval.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Na-echekwa usoro mbufe njem n'usoro nke ọma** (Maintaining an orderly transfer process) - While the system creates order, the *primary goal* isn't orderliness for its own sake.  It's about control.
* **C: Na-enyocha oge ọnụnọ onye ọbịa** (Checking the duration of a visitor's stay) - This is *part* of the process (requiring proof of planned departure), but not the overarching *purpose*.
* **D: Na-akwado eziokwu paspọtụ** (Validating passports) -  Valid passports are *required*, but the passage goes *beyond* passport validity to require additional permits and checks, indicating a broader purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Okpokolo agba kacha elu (High-end branded glasses):** The passage says these *might* be more expensive abroad due to fakes or import costs.
* **C: Nchebe anya (Eye protection):** The passage doesn't discuss the cost of eye protection.
* **D: Okpokolo agba na-enweghị aha nke ụdị (Generic brand glasses):** The passage doesn't specifically mention generic glasses and their cost.

The passage specifically states: ""Okpokolo aha-brandi ogo-elu dị dị n’ụdị ebe ahụ nwere ike inwe nsogbu abụọ; ụfọdụ nwere ike ịbụ adịgboroja..."" This directly addresses the risk of counterfeit products when purchasing expensive glasses abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ikekwe nlele anya nke abụọ dị mkpa** - While a second eye exam might be beneficial, the passage doesn't focus on the *need* for it, but rather the cost of getting it done abroad.
*   **B: O kwere omume na ụfọdụ ugogbe anya anya agaghị arụ ọrụ na ndenye ọgwụ** - The passage mentions needing prescriptions filled elsewhere, but doesn't suggest the glasses themselves won't *work* with a prescription.
*   **D: Ọnụ ego ahụ nwere ike ọ gaghị ekpuchi ya site na mkpuchi** - The passage mentions insurance potentially not covering the cost, but this is a general concern with healthcare costs, not specifically tied to buying glasses abroad.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ọ na-ara ezigbote ahụ ịgbanwe ego Falklands ma e si n'agwaetiti a pụọ, ya mere gbanwee ego gi túpụ i si na ya pụọ."" (It is very difficult to exchange Falklands currency once you leave the islands, so change your money before you leave.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agwaetiti ndị dị anya na-ewere naanị kaadị kredit na paụnd Britain** - The passage states that card acceptance is unreliable outside of Stanley, and US dollars are also accepted.
* **B: Naanị ebe ga-anata dollar na ego US bụ Stanley** - The passage mentions acceptance of dollars *around* the Stanley Historical Card area, implying it's not limited to just Stanley itself.
* **D: N'ozuzu, paụnd Britain bụ ego a kacha amata, nke Falkland na-esote ya** - The passage doesn't rank the popularity of the currencies. It states both are accepted but highlights the difficulty of exchanging Falkland Pounds *after* leaving the islands.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""A ga-achọtali n’ime Stanley n’ofe site n’ụlọ ahịa FIC West"" (It can be found throughout Stanley via the FIC West shop). This implies the FIC West shop is the place to go for currency exchange, which is crucial for non-card payments.
* **The passage also warns:** ""Ọ na-ara ezigbote ahụ ịgbanwe ego Falklands ma e si n'agwaetiti a pụọ, ya mere gbanwee ego gi tupu i si na ya pụọ."" (It is very difficult to exchange Falkland pounds once you leave the islands, so change your money before you leave). This reinforces the importance of using FIC West *before* leaving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Site n'otu agwaetiti ruo n'ọzọ** - The passage doesn't suggest ease of payments between islands.
* **C: Agwaetiti ndị dị anya** - Payments are difficult in remote islands, according to the text.
* **D: Ebe niile site na Stanley** - While GBP and USD *are* accepted in Stanley, the passage points to FIC West as the central location for exchange into local currency (FKP) for widespread use.



"
Kedu ihe omume megidere mmemme a na-eme n'ụlọ nsọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Amu nwa elephant**.

Here's why:

The passage states the festivals involve commemorating the temple, birthdays of deities, or other important events *within* the temple.  ""Amu nwa elephant"" (elephant pageantry) is mentioned as part of the vibrant spectacle of Kerala temple festivals, but it’s presented as an *element of* the festivals, not an opposing event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ịka akara ụbọchị ncheta ụlọ nsọ** - This is *part* of what the festivals are about.
*   **C: Ụbọchị ọmụmụ chi** - This is *part* of what the festivals are about.
*   **D: Oge dị mkpa gbasara ụlọ nsọ** - This is a general description that encompasses the festivals, not something in opposition to them.

The passage is describing the festivals *themselves*, and the elephant pageantry is a *feature* of those festivals.

This directly connects seeing decorated elephants to temple festivals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebe n'etiti ngwụcha Nọvemba ruo etiti Mee:** This is a time *frame* for the festivals, not a *place* to see elephants.
* **B: Ebe nsọ:** While elephants are *at* temples, the passage emphasizes seeing them *during the festivals*.
* **D: Gburugburu okporo ụzọ Kerala:** The passage focuses on temple festivals, not generally around roads in Kerala.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the clearest way to justify the high cost of first or business class is to **have your company pay for it**.  It explains that the cost is significantly higher than economy, and even finding discounts doesn't usually make it worthwhile for standard point-to-point travel. The passage points out that those who *do* pay for these classes are those who can expense it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Họrọ klas mbụ karịa azụmahịa** – The passage says both are expensive, and doesn't suggest one is better for saving money.
* **C: Tiketi ụgbọ elu klaasị mbụ na-abụghị eduzi** – The passage doesn't address non-refundable tickets.
* **D: Enwere ike ịme nkwekọrịta** – The passage specifically says it's generally *not* worthwhile to look for discounts.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that premium (business class or first class) fares can be **four times** the cost of economy and even **eleven times** the cost of first class. It then states that looking for discounts on these higher fares for direct flights is generally *not* worthwhile.  Therefore, the passage is discussing the downsides of choosing **business class**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ugbọ elu n'ahịrị kwụ ọtọ:** While the passage mentions direct flights, the focus isn't on the flights themselves, but the *cost* of higher classes on those flights.
*   **C: Mbelata:** The passage specifically argues against *seeking* discounts on premium fares.
*   **D: Mbụ ọnụego:** While first class is mentioned, the main point is the overall high cost of premium travel, with business class being a prime example.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states to *remember to add* the cost of extra visas, departure taxes, and ground transportation when considering travel *outside* of Africa. This implies that these costs are *not* necessary to consider when comparing prices for travel *within* Africa. Therefore, the added visa costs for non-African destinations are what the passage highlights as not needing to be included in the comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọnụ ego ụtụ isi ọpụpụ na Africa:** The passage says to *include* departure taxes for non-Africa locations.
*   **C: Visa maka Africa dị oke ọnụ:** The passage doesn't say African visas are expensive, just to remember visa costs for *other* places.
*   **D: Ọnụ ego a na-ana maka njem ala na mpụga Africa:**  Like departure taxes, the passage mentions needing to consider ground transport costs for destinations *outside* Africa.

Kedu ihe a na-akọ na ụlọ ahịa ahịa na-amalite inye ụdịdị dị iche iche?,"The correct answer is **A: Nri esigoro esi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Nnukwu ụlọahịa gasị na-ewetazi mpaghara dị iche iche ndị nwere nri e siri esi."" This directly translates to ""Large supermarkets began to create different areas with ready-to-eat food.""  The passage is discussing the introduction of diverse *ready-to-eat food* options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ihe e ji esitụ nri n'ọkụ (Grills):** While some stores *also* added grills, the main focus of the diversification is ready-to-eat meals.
*   **C: Ulọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị nso (Nearby restaurants):** The passage is about changes *within* the supermarket, not restaurants nearby.
*   **D: Akwụ ụgwọ ezi uche dị na ya (Fair pricing):** The passage mentions affordability, but doesn't link it to the diversification of food options.

Here's why:

The passage states that when there isn't a full grocery section, people are limited to pre-prepared foods. This means there's a *limited variety* of options available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ulọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị nso (Nearby restaurants):** The passage doesn't mention restaurants, only what's available *within* the supermarket.
*   **C: Nri ọhụrụ (Fresh food):** The passage focuses on the lack of options *besides* pre-prepared food, suggesting fresh ingredients are not readily available.
*   **D: Oven na ngwa ndakwa nri (Ovens and cooking appliances):** While some stores might have these, the passage focuses on the *lack of options* for cooking yourself, not the availability of cooking equipment.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike bụrụ nsogbu maka ndị Switzerland na ndị Belgium na-asụ French?,"The correct answer is **B: Okwu Frenchị ndị dị iche**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""vocabulary some words are slightly different"" between the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland and that spoken in France. This is the direct source of potential misunderstanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihe ngosi French a na-ahụkarị maka ọnụọgụgụ** - While the passage mentions differences in number systems, it states that even with these differences, speakers can still understand each other.
*   **C: Akpọpụta okwu French kpọmkwem** - The passage says there are *slight* pronunciation differences, which aren’t necessarily problematic enough to cause significant misunderstanding.
*   **D: Ọtụtụ asụsụ Frenchị a na-asụ n'ime Fransị** - The passage focuses on the *varieties* of French, not the multiplicity of languages in France.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị akwado France, Belgium, ma ọ bụ Switzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Otu esi ekwu okwu ọ bụla** (How each word is spoken).

Here's why:

The passage states that the dialects in Belgium and Switzerland are *similar enough that someone who understands one will understand the others, and even standard French.* It specifically mentions differences in **number systems** (B) and slight variations in **pronunciation of some words** (D). It also mentions that Belgians and Swiss are taught **standard French in school** (C).

However, the passage *doesn't* say that the way *every single word* is spoken is the same across all three regions. It implies subtle differences, but doesn’t claim identical pronunciation for all words. Therefore, the way each word is spoken is the one thing the passage doesn’t support as being consistent across France, Belgium, and Switzerland.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""WestJet"" is one of the airlines that *does* offer refunds in the form of future travel credit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention anything about direct booking versus third-party booking impacting refunds.
* **C:** Lufthansa only offers refunds for flights originating in the U.S. or Canada, not flights *from* Paris.
* **D:** While Delta offers refunds, the passage doesn't guarantee you'll *get* one, only that they *offer* them. The passage emphasizes you need to call the airline directly to do so.

The passage specifically states: ""N'ọnọdụ niile, i ga-ejiriri ekwentị gị akwụ ụgwọ ọnọdụ gị n'ụlọ ọrụ ụgbọelu a."" This means you must book directly via phone to take advantage of the bereavement fares.

*   **A: Ha na-akwụ ụgwọ maka njem njem olili ozu** - While the fares *are* for bereavement travel, this isn't a fact *about* the fares themselves, but rather their purpose.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...if you don't have data on your phone, or when they are out of cell range, their performance may be limited or completely unreliable.""
* This directly implies that a dedicated GPS device is better when you're *outside* of cell service areas, as it doesn't rely on a data connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mgbe ịchọrọ ibelata ọnụ ahịa** (When you want to reduce costs): The passage says phone GPS apps *save* money compared to dedicated devices.
* **B: Ozugbo ị mara na ị ga-enwe njikọ data** (Once you know you will have a data connection):  This is the opposite of when a phone GPS is *less* reliable.
* **D: Mgbe ị naekpebi megide ịgbazinye ngwaọrụ** (When you decide against renting a device): This is a personal preference, not a functional advantage of one type of GPS over the other.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that GPS apps on phones ""may have limited or no functionality if you do not have data service on your phone, or when they are outside of cell service areas.""  This directly addresses the concern about relying on data connectivity, which a dedicated GPS device doesn't have.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: emefu obere:** The passage doesn't mention size.
*   **C: Enweghị ike ịgbazite ụlọ:** The passage mentions renting cars, not houses.
*   **D: enweghị ịzụrụ maapụ ọhụrụ:** While the passage mentions saving money on maps, this is a benefit of phone apps *compared to dedicated GPS devices*, not a reason to choose a dedicated device *over* a phone app.

The passage specifically states: ""Kpachara anya hụ na ejenti ị ga-eji akwụ ụgwọ bụ onye maara Galapagos ọfụma ma mara ọtụtụ ụgbọ mmiri di iche iche."" This directly suggests using a travel agency specializing in Galapagos tours to ensure you're matched with the right boat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: idobe otu opekata mpe mmadụ 8+ na-ekerịta ọdịmma** - The passage doesn't mention group size as a factor in selecting the right boat.
*   **B: Nhazi emere n'oge mgbụsị akwụkwọ** - While booking in advance is good, it doesn't guarantee the right boat.
*   **D: Ndokwa mbụ** -  This is too vague. The passage emphasizes *who* you book with, not just that you book early.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị usoro nke casinos na-eji mee ka ndị ahịa na-egwu egwu, dị ka ekwuru na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ìhè sitere na anyanwụ n'ụba** (Abundant sunlight).

Here's why:

* **The passage states casinos deliberately *lack* windows and clocks (D).** This is to disorient people and make them lose track of time.
* **The passage mentions free drinks and entertainment (C) are used to keep people happy and spending money.**
* **The passage implies casinos have complicated layouts to make exiting difficult.** This relates to option B, which suggests a fee for leaving (like a ticket).
* **The passage does *not* mention anything about abundant sunlight.** In fact, the lack of windows is a key strategy.

Therefore, abundant sunlight is the only option that isn't a tactic used by casinos as described in the text."
"Kedu ihe onye na-agba chaa chaa maara ihe kwesịrị ịnọpụ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: ịṅụbiga mmanya ókè (drinking excessively)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""mmanya ogbugbu na-egbochi echiche, ma ndị nille na-agba chaa chaa nke ọma mara mkpa nke ọ dị ịnọ n'ezi echiche."" This directly translates to ""alcohol clouds judgment, but those who gamble well know the importance of being in a right mind.""  Therefore, a key thing a smart gambler knows is to avoid excessive drinking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ịnakwere ụgwọ ọrụ nke ụdị ọ bụla (accepting any form of bribe):** While potentially unethical, the passage doesn't mention anything about bribes.
*   **C: na-enyocha oge ma ọ bụ elekere (checking the time or clock):** The passage explicitly says casinos *don't* have clocks and windows to make people lose track of time.
*   **D: ịchọpụta ebe ọpụpụ kacha nso dị (finding the nearest exit):** The passage states exits are deliberately difficult to find.

"Kedu akụkụ okwu ka etinyere n'isi n'etiti nkebiokwu, dịka akụkụ nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Ngwaa** (Nouns).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that capitalization is often used to distinguish *ngwaa* (nouns) and *nkọwa aha* (names/titles).  The capitalization helps to quickly identify those elements within a sentence. The other options (adjectives, adverbs) are not specifically mentioned as being highlighted through capitalization in the text."
Kedu ihe akụkụ ahụ ga-atụ aro ka isi okwu nke aha nwere ike gbakọọ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịmata ngwaa dị iche iche** (Identifying different products).

Here's why:

The passage states the use of capitalization, even mid-sentence, ""is an important way to distinguish between products and concepts."" The whole point is to help you quickly recognize *what* is being discussed – i.e., identify the product or term being referenced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọgụgụ (Reading):** While it *makes* reading easier, the capitalization isn't *about* reading itself, but about recognizing the subject.
*   **C: Na-ede (Writing):** The passage discusses a writing style, but the effect is on the *reader*, not the writer.
*   **D: Na-ekewa ihe dị iche iche (Distinguishing things):** While it does distinguish, it specifically distinguishes *products and concepts* - making B the more accurate answer.



"
"""Kedu ihe mmegharị ahụ na-egosi """"gafere"""" n'ime ime obodo Malaysia?""","The correct answer is **A: na-eji mkpịsị aka aka iji tụgharịa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that in Malaysia, among the Malays, extending your hand palm down means ""come"" as if beckoning someone with your fingers curled. This is a turning of the hand motion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ịfefe** - The passage describes a specific gesture, not a general waving motion.
*   **C: Elu-fiving** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: na-enye nzaghachi dị mma** - While a gesture *could* be part of a positive response, the passage details a specific meaning for the gesture in Malaysian culture.



"
"""Kedu ngagharị nke enwere ike ịkọwa site na paragraf ka """"laghachite""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ị na-efegharị, tụgharịa aka gị n'ime**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in Spain, a certain handshake (""ka ọdị"") involves turning the palm *towards* the person shaking your hand (essentially turning your hand inwards from their perspective). This is what ""laghachite"" (to turn back) refers to in the context of the handshake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: A na-atụgharị mkpịsị aka mkpịsị aka** - This doesn't describe the overall movement of the hand.
*   **C: Mgbe ị na-efegharị, tụgharịa ọbụ aka gị ka ọ pụta ìhè** - This means turning the palm outwards, which is the opposite of what the passage describes.
*   **D: na-efegharị isi ha** - This refers to the head, not the hand.



"
"Kedu ihe na-eme crvasses, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **B: glaciers na-adịghị ike**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how glaciers don't stay still, and how this movement causes cracking and splitting in the snow (""akwa sno""). It explains that heavy ice breaks and can even overturn. This all points to the instability of glaciers being the cause of the cracks (crevasses).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akwa mmiri ejiri snow mee:** While snow is *part* of a glacier, it doesn't explain the *cause* of crevasses.
*   **C: Ọgba ice na-emikpu:**  The passage describes movement *within* the glacier, not the entire glacier collapsing.
*   **D: Ihe mgbochi anaghị akwụsi ike:** The passage doesn’t mention any obstructions.



"
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike izobe àkwà mmiri snow, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Mgbawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...akpụrụ mmiri nwere ike ikpuchido. Mgbidi na mkpuchi elu nke ọgba akpụrụ mmiri nwere ike ịda ma **mechie mgbawa**."" This directly links avalanches to potentially covering and protecting snow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ọgba aghara oyi (Ice cave):** The passage doesn't mention ice caves.
* **C: Mgbidi (Walls):** While walls are mentioned, the passage says they *fall* and cause avalanches, they don't protect from them.
* **D: nnukwu iberibe (Large rocks):** The passage doesn’t mention large rocks.

"Kedu ebe chọrọ usoro nchekwa ndị ọzọ n'ihu ndị ọbịa, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: mpaghara Goma gbara ya gburugburu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dịka Goma nwetụrụ nchekwa n’ụdị dịtụ mma, nleta ọ bụla na mpụga Goma bụ nke ekwesịrị inyocha iji ghọta ọnọdụ nke ọgụ ka nogidesiri ike n’Ugwu ngalaba ọchịchị kizu.""

This directly translates to: ""As Goma has experienced relative security, any visit outside of Goma requires investigation to understand the ongoing conflict situation in the surrounding areas.""

Therefore, the area requiring extra security precautions for visitors is the region *around* Goma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ugwu mgbawa a na-akpọ Nyiragongo:** While Nyiragongo is a hazard, the passage doesn't say visitors to the volcano specifically need extra security. It's the wider area that's unstable.
*   **C: Obi obodo:** The passage mentions the city center was damaged by lava, but doesn't state it's specifically unsafe for visitors.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as a neighboring country, but the text focuses on security concerns within the DRC, surrounding Goma."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ga-abụ ndụmọdụ ọjọọ maka onye ọbịa na Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Agha North Kivu na-atọ ụtọ (The North Kivu conflict is enjoyable)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...any travel outside of Goma should be carefully considered to understand the ongoing security situation in the North Kivu region."" This clearly indicates that the conflict is *not* something to be taken lightly or considered enjoyable. It's a serious safety concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọnụ ego nlekota gorilla ugwu bụ ihe ezi uche dị na ya ebe a (Mountain gorilla trekking costs are reasonable here):** The passage doesn’t discuss the cost of gorilla trekking.
*   **C: Iji tagzi ọgba tum tum bụ ụzọ dị mma iji mee njem (Using a motorcycle taxi is a good way to get around):** The passage *mentions* boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) and gives a price, suggesting they are a common form of transport.
*   **D: Obodo ahụ bụ ebe ntọala ugwu mgbawa nke Nyangongo dị (The town is a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano):** The passage explicitly states, “The town is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.”



"
Kedu ụbọchị n'August ka a ga-enweta ikike ịla azụ azụ?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 nke Jenụwarị**.

Here's why:

The passage states that permits are available four months before the start of the month for which they are needed. Since the question asks about August permits, you need to go back four months: August -> July -> June -> May -> **January**.  Therefore, permits for August trips become available on January 1st.

Kedu iwu etinyere iji gbochie mmebi nke ọwa mmiri ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke akwụkwọ ikike**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Enwere oke nye akwụkwọ ikike nkwado maka njem nkwugharị nke a na enye ndị bu ụzọ bịa."" This directly translates to ""There is a limit to the number of permits available, given on a first-come, first-served basis.""  Limiting the number of permits is a way to prevent overuse and damage to the canyon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usoro ikike nke na-ebu ụzọ bịa, na-ebute ụzọ:** While true, this describes *how* permits are distributed, not a rule to prevent damage.
* **B: Naanị na Jenụwarị 1st ka a ga-enye ikike:** This only refers to when permits become available for a specific month (May), not a general rule for protecting the canyon.
* **C: Naanị ụzọ ị ga-esi nweta ikike bụ ịrịọ arịrịọ:** This describes the process of getting a permit, not a conservation measure.

Kedu n'ime ụlọ ndị a dabara na nkọwa nke ụdị ụlọ nkwari akụ a kacha nta?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọbịa ama ama ma ọ bụ ndị ama ama**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states these inns sometimes hosted ""ndị isi obodo na ndị a maara aha ha bụ ndị ọbịa"" (local leaders and famous people as guests).  This directly matches option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mmanya na-eje ozi cocktails** - While these inns had food and drink, the passage doesn't focus on the *type* of drink.
*   **B: Ebe a na-eri nri gourmet n'ime ụlọ** - The passage mentions food, but doesn't describe it as ""gourmet"".  It was basic sustenance for travelers.
*   **D: mmelite nke oge a n'ime ụlọ ndị emezigharịrị nso nso a** - The passage emphasizes the *historical* nature of these inns - they are old and have items from past eras, not recently updated.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the historical significance of these inns.** It specifically mentions relics from the steamship and railway age, before WWII and the 1930s/early 1900s. The passage highlights the *atmosphere* and history of these places. An antique surrounding would appeal to a buyer interested in that atmosphere.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ụlọ ọrụ siri nri ama ama (A famous catering company):** The passage focuses on the *inn itself* as a place to stay and eat, not the quality of catering.
* **C: A mmanya nke nwere ntụrụndụ kwa abalị (A liquor that provides entertainment every night):**  While alcohol is mentioned in relation to the inns, the main focus isn't on a specific brand of liquor.
* **D: ọnụ ahịa nkwari akụ dị ọnụ ala (Low accommodation prices):** The passage suggests these inns catered to people with money (""Onye njem nwere nnukwu ego...""). Price isn't the selling point.

"Kedu ihe a ga-ezere, dịka ederede, ndị ọbịa na Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: ""na-akpọ onye bi na Greenland """"Eskimo""""""**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""N’agbanyeghị na ị nwere ike ịnụ Ndị mba Griinlandị iji mkpụrụokwu a, ojiji ya kwesịrị ịbụ nke ndị mba ọzọ ga-ezere."" (Despite the fact that you may hear Greenlanders use the term, its use should be avoided by foreigners.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọtụtụ ebe nwere akụkọ mpụ dị elu** - The text mentions crime is rare in Greenland (""Mpụ, na ịnwe atụmatụ ọjọọ megide ndị ala ọzọ, anaghị eme na Greenland chaachaa. Ma n'obodo ha, enweghị """"ogbe isi mgbaka."""""").
*   **B: Weta uwe siri ike n'ihi na ọ na-ekpo ọkụ n'afọ niile** - The text clearly indicates the opposite - you need warm clothing due to the cold (""Ị gaa ileta Grinland n'oge oyi ... ọ dị mkpa i"
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike ịkpata nsogbu maka ndị ọbịa na-adịghị njikere na Greenland, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ihu igwe**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Oyi bụ sọ ihe ize ndụ ndị na-adịghị njikere ga agabiga."" and ""Ị gaa ileta Grinland n'oge oyi... ọ dị mkpa iji akwa nchụ oyi.""  It also mentions long daylight hours in summer can cause sleep problems. These all relate to the weather and climate being a potential problem for unprepared visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: anwụnta ndị Nordic:** While the text mentions midges (anwụnta), it says they don't carry diseases and only *might* bite. This isn’t presented as a significant hazard for unprepared visitors.
*   **B: Mpụ:** The text says malicious intent towards foreigners is rare in Greenland.
*   **D: Ndị obodo:** The text portrays the local people as welcoming, and there's no indication they pose a problem to visitors.



"
Central plaza nke taa dị n'ime obodo ndị a?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jardín de la Unión...nowadays is a plaza, where many things happen in the morning and at night."" This directly identifies it as the central plaza. The other options refer to specific features *within* or *near* the plaza, but aren't the plaza itself.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu, dịka ekwuru na paragraf, gbasara Jardn de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Ebe obibi ndị nọn ochie**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** Jardín de la Unión was built *as an atrium for a 17th-century convent*, meaning it was *adjacent* to the convent, and the Templo de San Diego is the only building remaining from that time. This doesn't mean the garden was the *living space* of the nuns.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true, according to the text:

* **A: egwu egwu na Central gazebo** - The text mentions ""cultural events in the afternoons and evenings"" happening in the plaza, implying music or performances.
* **B: ebe akụkọ ịhụnanya mbụ dị** - Callejon del Basso is specifically described as the location of an old love story.
* **C: Ụlọ nri-chere ogige ihu** - The text states ""many restaurants surround the garden.""

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...onye ọbụla ahụ gbasituru ike ga-ekpori ndụ na ha."" (Anyone in good shape will enjoy it). This directly supports the idea that people with a good level of health can enjoy hiking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maka njem ụbọchị na ụzọ dị mfe, atụmatụ dị ntakịrị dị mkpa.** (For a day trip on an easy path, a little planning is important) While the passage suggests some preparation might be needed, it doesn't emphasize that *planning* is essential.
*   **B: Ọ bụ ezie na ebe dị anya na-adịgasị iche, e mere ha ka e were mee njem n’otu ụbọchị.** (Although distances vary, they are made to be done in one day). The passage states that hikes can range from less than a mile to those that can be completed in a day. It doesn’t say distances are “made” for day trips.
*   **D: Ezinụlọ ndị nwere ụmụntakịrị kwesịrị izere ịga njem n'ụbọchị.** (Families with small children should avoid day trips). The passage actually states the opposite – that day trips *can* include babies and young children, though families might need more preparation.

The passage states: ""Maka ịrị ugwu n'ụbọchị site n'okporo dị mfe obere nkwadobe ka ọ ga-ewe, ma onye ọbụla ahụ gbasituru ike ga-ekpori ndụ na ha."" This directly means that a day hike requires less preparation if the hiker is in good physical condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbe nzọ ụkwụ siri ike na-etinye aka** - The passage doesn't mention the terrain influencing preparation.
*   **C: Ozugbo ụmụaka malitere hiking** - While the passage mentions families with children might need more preparation, it doesn't say hiking *starts* with needing less preparation.
*   **D: ọ bụrụ na a na-eme njem ahụ n'ọnọdụ dị mma karịa** - The passage doesn't mention weather conditions affecting preparation levels.



"
"N'adịghị ka ndị Norway ndị ọzọ, gịnị na-akọwa ala dị larịị na Rogaland ma ọ bụ Agder?","The correct answer is **A: Osisi dị**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that in Rogaland and Agder, these flat lands (""hei"") are defined by *not having trees* (""enweghị osisi"").  The question asks what *defines* these flat lands compared to other Norwegian areas.  The defining characteristic is the absence of trees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fjords anọghị ya:** The text doesn't mention fjords in relation to these areas.
* **C: Ọtụtụ n'ime ala dị larịị bụ otu:** The text doesn't discuss whether the land is uniform or not.
* **D: Ugboro ugboro, heather na-ekpuchi ha:** The text doesn't mention heather.



"
"Kedu ihe na-agaghị abụ njirimara Norway, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Platea nwere osisi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes ""vidde"" and ""hei"" as flat, treeless areas. This means areas with trees are *not* a characteristic of the landscapes described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mpaghara ala na-emepebeghị emepe (Open, expansive areas):** The ""vidde"" and ""hei"" are described as expansive.
*   **C: Fjords siri ike (Rugged fjords):** The passage mentions mountains, which often lead to fjords, and the description of the landscape suggests ruggedness.
*   **D: Moorland:**  ""Vidde"" and ""hei"" can be considered types of moorland (open, heather-covered hills).



"
Kedu mgbe ndị na-agba ski ga-aga n'ebe ntụrụndụ nke ugwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe oyi na-abịa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the mountains are good for hiking in the summer, but become suitable for skiing and snowboarding *when snow falls in the mountains during winter*.  Therefore, skiers would go to the mountain resorts **when winter comes**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: elu nke oge** - ""Elu nke oge"" (height of the season) is too vague and doesn’t directly correlate with the text.
*   **C: Mgbe oge okpomọkụ India rutere** - The passage specifically contrasts summer (hiking) with winter (skiing).
*   **D: Mgbe mmiri rutere** - The passage does not mention rain or water as a condition for skiing.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""But, they have appeal in the winter, when snow falls on many mountains and offers effervescent activities like skiing and snowboarding."" This directly links peak tourism to the winter season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N'ime oge nke oke snow** - While significant snow is needed, it's the entire winter season, not just periods of *heavy* snow, that attracts tourists.
* **B: dum snowboarding oge** - Snowboarding is *an* activity during winter, but not the defining time for all mountain resort visitors. People go for skiing, sightseeing, etc.
* **C: Mgbe oge okpomọkụ India rutere** - The passage specifically contrasts summer (when they have a different appeal) with winter.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states you need to *walk around the docks*, approach people cleaning boats, and try to contact boat owners.  This is the most direct action described for finding boats needing help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: iso ndị ọchịagha na-emekọ ihe** (working with officials) - The passage doesn't mention working with authorities.
* **C: na-akwalite azụmahịa gị** (promoting your business) - The focus is on *providing* help, not self-promotion.
* **D: A na-eleghara ndị njem nọ n'ụgbọ mmiri ndị ọzọ anya** (Ignoring other passengers on boats) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests – you need to *engage* with people.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states you should ""anwa ịkpọtụrụ ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ mmiri nọ n'ụlọ nkwụ ha"" (try to contact boat owners in their slips).  It also mentions approaching people cleaning their boats and talking to them. This all points to actively *finding and contacting* boat owners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apụọ n'anya (Leave)** - The passage is about *engaging* with people, not avoiding them.
* **C: Abịakwutela onye ọ bụla ma ọ bụrụ na ha na-ehicha ụgbọ mmiri ha (Don't approach anyone if they're cleaning their boat)** - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
* **D: Debe ndị na-akụ ọkpọ ndị ọzọ n'ọnụ mmiri (Put other dockers in the water)** - This makes no sense in the context of the passage and is likely a distractor.

This refers to the area of Hong Kong Island itself, where the British colonial administration established itself. ""Obi Hong Kong"" translates to ""Hong Kong Island"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Northern Oke osimiri** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the northern coastline in relation to colonial history.
*   **B: Oghere mmiri dị na Kowloon** - While Kowloon is mentioned as a good place to *view* Hong Kong Island, it wasn't the primary location of British colonial administration.
*   **D: Ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri Victoria** - Victoria Harbour is important, but the passage points to the island itself as the place to find evidence of past rule.



"
Ebee ka onye njem nke ji vista na-akpali akpali kpọrọ ihe ga-achọ ịga?,"The correct answer is **D: Oghere mmiri dị na Kowloon**.

The passage states: ""Ịhụta Họng Kọng n'ụzọ kachasị mma, pụọ n'agwaetiti gawa na Kowloon, mpaghara akụkụ mmiri, nke chere gị ihu."" This directly translates to ""To see Hong Kong in the best way, leave the island and go to Kowloon, the waterfront area, which awaits you.""  Therefore, a visitor seeking the best view should head to Kowloon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri Victoria:** While Victoria Harbour is *in* Kowloon and a great view, the passage doesn't specifically mention going *to* the harbor itself.
*   **B: Hong Kong n'ụdị ya ziri ezi:** This is too broad and doesn't point to a specific location.
*   **C: agwaetiti Hong Kong:** The passage suggests *leaving* Hong Kong Island to get the best view.

*   **A: ọbụ ụkwụ dị gịrịgịrị** - The passage does not mention stirrups being different sizes.
*   **C: akpụkpọ ụkwụ mere akpụkpọ anụ** - The passage says riders wear boots *with* soles that are rough and flexible, not stirrups made of leather.
*   **D: kwụsie ike karị** - The passage doesn't discuss the stability of the saddle itself.

Here's why:

The passage states that many skiers wear boots with ""stiff soles and soft tops."" This stiffness in the sole is what helps prevent the foot from being trapped in the binding during a fall, thus improving safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Akpụkpọ anụ (Leather):** While boots can be made of leather, the passage doesn't say leather specifically improves safety.
*   **C: Ikiri ụkwụ (Foot grips):** The passage doesn't mention foot grips as a safety feature.

* **The passage directly states:** ""Njikọ mgbanwe nke ile ọbịa bụ nzụkọ na ejikọ ndị njem na ndị obodo n’ime ụmụ obodo ndị ha na-aga eleta."" This translates to ""Home exchange networks connect travelers with locals in the areas they are visiting.""  The key function is providing lodging/accommodation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ụgbọ elu na ọnụ ahịa mbelata (Flights at reduced prices):** While Kasi Fentun *found* a cheap flight, the home exchange network itself doesn't provide flights.
* **C: Ndị ndu ime obodo na-eduga njegharị (Local guides leading tours):** The passage doesn't mention guided tours.
* **D: mmekọrịta ya na ndị njem nlegharị anya ndị ọzọ n'otu ebe ahụ (Interaction with other travelers in the same place):** While this *might* happen as a result of using the network, it isn't the network's primary function.

"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara netwọk maka mgbanwe ile ọbịa bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: A na-enye ndị njem nlegharị anya mgbe niile maka ndị ọbịa obodo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that lists of hosts *are* provided, but it doesn't say hosts are always provided for travelers. It specifically mentions that hosts are ""willing to accept"" and sometimes travelers provide references from past hosts. This implies availability isn't *guaranteed* for every traveler.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

*   **B: Ụfọdụ netwọk nwere ike ịrịọ maka nkwenye ndị njem ọzọ** - The text directly says ""ụfọdụ netwọọk na-enye maọbụ chọọ nkwenyeeziokwu ọzọ.""
*   **C: A ga-eme ka ndị ọbịa nwee ndepụta nke ndị ọbịa n'obodo ebe aga** - The text states “A ga-enyekwa, n'akwụkwọ na/maọbụ n'ịntanetị, aha ụfọdụ ndị dị njikere ịnabata”.
*   **D: Enwere oge mgbe ndị njem nleta nwere ike ịgụ nyocha nke ndị ọbịa obodo** - This is implied by the text mentioning that travelers may provide references from past hosts they have stayed with.

"Kedu ụdị onye ọbịa nwere ike ịnọ na ọnụ ụlọ ụlọ mbikọ nkekọrịta, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: onye ọbịa nke na-amalite na iri abụọ ha**

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ulo-obia na elekota karisia ndị na-eto eto – ndi obia na abiakari no n’afo agbata iri-abuo..."" (The boarding houses care for young adults – visitors who are between twenty years old...).
*   This directly indicates that the boarding houses primarily cater to people starting from the age of twenty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: onye ọbịa na-aga naanị ya** (a visitor who travels alone) - The text doesn’t say anything about whether visitors travel alone or not.
*   **C: onye ọbịa nke nwere ụmụntakịrị ya na ha** (a visitor who has their family with them) - The text says families are *not* usually seen there, though some places offer private rooms for them.
*   **D: onye ọbịa nke na-amalite na etiti iri ato ha** (a visitor who starts at the middle of thirty) - The text specifies the age range is around twenty, not thirty.



"
"Kedu onye, dịka ederede, ọ ga-abụ na ọ ga-anọ na ụlọ mbikọ?","The correct answer is **A: di na nwunye na obere nwa ezumike**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Anaghị ahụtakarị ezinụlọ chị ụmụ, mana ụfọdụ ebe ọnụnọ na-enye ha ụlọ nkeonwe."" (Families don't usually bring children, but some accommodations offer private houses.) This suggests the accommodations cater to adults, and sometimes couples *with* a small child.
* **Option A** best fits this description - a couple with a small child (a 'nwa ezumike' is a baby or young child).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text focuses on accommodations that *don't* cater to groups of people traveling.
* **C:** While the accommodations might accept older couples, the text doesn't specifically highlight them.
* **D:** The text specifically states families usually *don't* bring children.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ekwu gbasara ịtụba boomerang bụ eziokwu, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ọtụtụ boomerangs nwere ike ịlaghachi, mana ọ bụghị ha niile.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states, ""Ịtụ atụ nke boomerang bụ nka ama ama nke ọtụtụ ndị njem nleta chọrọ inweta... gbalịa hụ na Ị nwere nke na alaghachikwute alaghachikwute."" This means not all boomerangs return.
*   It also states, ""Oka-na-onuogugu igba-okirikiri di na mba Australia bu n’ezie nke na anaghi alaghachi azu."" (Traditional Australian boomerangs don't return) This reinforces that there are boomerangs that don't return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't guarantee a boomerang will *always* return.
*   **B:** The passage doesn't say anything about who likes boomerangs more, locals or tourists.
*   **C:** While the passage mentions Australia, it doesn't claim they have a wide variety of boomerangs, only that traditional ones don't return.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-eme ka ọtụtụ nri Javanese?,"The correct answer is **B: sugar na ntụ ntụ**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Javanese food is characterized by a strong preference for ""sugar (especially Javanese sugar) and other spices with flavor."" Option B directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: NKE Ọcha** - The passage doesn't mention anything about being clean or white as a characteristic.
*   **C: sugar mere si aki oyibo** - The passage mentions Javanese sugar specifically, not sugar made from foreign sources.
*   **D: Sugar gbara ọchịchịrị** - While Javanese sugar can be dark, the passage doesn't highlight the color as a defining characteristic but the flavor and preference for it.



"
Paragraf a na-ajụ ka ọrịa na-efe efe si eto?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọrịa nje** (Viruses).

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Ọrịa na-efe efe bụ otu nke patoginụ kpatara, dị ka nje, bakterium, nje ero ma ọ bụ parasaịtị ndị ọzọ."" This translates to ""Infectious diseases are caused by a pathogen, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or other parasites."" The question asks *how* infectious diseases arise. While the other options are related to the topic, only viruses (and other pathogens) *cause* infectious diseases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị na-arịa ọrịa** (People with diseases) - People *spread* infectious diseases, but they don't cause them to originate.
*   **C: Nje bacteria** (Bacteria) - Bacteria are *a type* of pathogen that can cause infectious diseases, but the paragraph lists multiple types, so it’s not the comprehensive answer to *how* they arise.
*   **D: Ịgba ọgwụ mgbochi ọrịa** (Vaccinations) - Vaccinations *prevent* infectious diseases, they don't cause them.



"
"Kedu ihe na-enweghị ugbu a ama ama etiology ọrịa na-efe efe, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ịgba ọgwụ mgbochi ọrịa (Vaccination)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ọtụtụ gọọmenti na mba dị iche iche nwere iwu na onye ọbụla na-abata maọbụ na-apụ n'obodo ha ga-ebu ụzọ gbaa ọgwụ mgbochi megide ụfọdụ ọrịa dị iche iche."" This directly addresses things *required* regarding infectious diseases, and vaccination is the main requirement mentioned. The passage doesn't state that viruses, bacteria, or parasites are unknown causes; it *defines* them as causes of infectious diseases.

Therefore, vaccination is the correct answer because it's the preventative measure often required to deal with infectious diseases, as stated in the text."
N'ọnọdụ ndị dị aṅaa ka onye na-azụ ahịa ga-enwe afọ ojuju na proxy webụ karịa ndị na-eweta VPN nke ha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọtụtụ ndegharị okporo ụzọ onye ọrụ bụ maka http**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that VPNs route *all* internet traffic, while web proxies often only handle HTTP traffic.** If a user's internet activity is primarily HTTP-based (e.g., basic web browsing), a web proxy might be sufficient and potentially cheaper or simpler than a VPN which offers broader protection/functionality that isn't needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onye ọrụ chọrọ ịgbanwe okporo ụzọ:** Both VPNs and proxies change IP addresses. This doesn't favor a proxy.
* **B: Onye ọrụ chọrọ ịnọ ebe dị anya site n'ileba anya na nyocha dịka ha nwere ike:** VPNs are *better* at this due to their encryption and routing of all traffic.
* **D: A chọrọ ọnụọgụ bandwidth dị oke oke ma dị elu maka mmemme onye ọrụ:** The passage states VPNs *typically* offer higher bandwidth, making them preferable for bandwidth-intensive tasks.



"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara VPN na proxies webụ bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Naanị http okporo ụzọ VPN nwere ike ibugharị ya**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

The text explicitly states: ""ha na-agbanwe ụzọ trafik ịntanetị niile, ọ bụghị naanị http."" (They change the route of all internet traffic, not just http.) This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the text:

*   **A: Tụnyere proxies webụ, VPN na-enyekarị bandwit karịa** - The text states: ""Ha na-enyekarị bandwidth dị elu karịa na saviisi ka mma"" (They usually offer higher bandwidth than better services - implicitly referring to proxies).
*   **B: Ọ bụghị ndị nnọchi anya webụ nwere ike ibugharị okporo ụzọ ịntanetị niile** - This is supported by the fact that the text points out VPNs route *all* traffic, suggesting proxies don't.
*   **C: Tụnyere VPN, proxies webụ na-enye ogo ọrụ dị obere** - The comparison of higher bandwidth implies VPNs offer a better level of service.

Kedu ihe kpatara na mmadụ ga-eji ekwentị na-eweta ekwentị na-anọghị n'akụkụ ya nso?,"The correct answer is **A: Oku ekwentị dabere na ịntanetị**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that you don't need a phone company based in your physical location, or even a local phone number. You can get internet satellite connection and *choose* a phone number from anywhere. This means the phone is functioning *because* of the internet connection, not a traditional landline (PSTN) or satellite directly.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: igwe ekwentị ụwa** - The passage doesn't mention a ""world phone machine"".
*   **C: Satịlaịtị** - While satellite internet is *used* to get the connection, the phone itself isn't directly a satellite phone. It relies on the internet service.
*   **D: Ekwentị PSTN** - The passage contrasts using this system *with* using an internet-based phone. PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is a traditional landline, which is specifically what you're avoiding.



"
"Kedu ihe enwere ike ịchọrọ, dabere na akụkụ ahụ, iji nweta ụfọdụ oku?","The correct answer is **A: Nweta ọnụọgụgụ zuru ụwa ọnụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that you *don't* need a local phone company or a local number. You can get a satellite internet connection and *choose* a phone number from anywhere (like Arizona even if you're in Alaska).  It also mentions needing a fully qualified dialing code (similar to a PSTN phone) to receive calls. This all points to needing a phone number that can be routed to you from anywhere – a global number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Were ụlọ ọrụ ekwentị dị na mpaghara were:** The passage explicitly states you *don't* need a local phone company.
* **C: Rịọ mpaghara gị maka nọmba:** Again, the passage says you're not limited to numbers in your area.
* **D: Nye iwu ekwentị PSTN:**  The passage mentions PSTN as a comparison to *how* a dialing code works, not something you give instructions *to*.

Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ ụgha gbasara etu esi akpọ okwu Italian?,"The correct answer is **B: A na-ekwu ọtụtụ okwu n'otu ụzọ e si dee ya**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""caro pụtara ezigbo, ebe carro pụtara ụgbọ ịnyịnya."" This demonstrates that the *same* spelling can have *different* pronunciations, and thus, are not pronounced the same way.  This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and align with the prompt's information:

* **A: Mkpọpụta nke abụọ r dị iche na nke otu r:** The prompt specifies the difference between single 'r' and double 'rr' pronunciation.
* **C: Ụfọdụ okwu na-eji mkpụrụedemede c na g nwere ike bụrụ ihe ịma aka:**  The prompt states to pay attention to 'c' and 'g' because their pronunciations change depending on the following vowel.
* **D: Ọtụtụ aha nwere mkpọpụta dị iche iche dabere na ụdaume na-esote:** This aligns with the information about 'c' and 'g' altering their sounds based on the next vowel.

Kedu n'ime àgwà Izmir ndị a dị tupu ugbu a?,"The correct answer is **D: Tile elu ụlọ na-acha uhie uhie**.

The passage specifically states: ""...ụlọ ndị nwere karama n'ihu ha na ebe ụlọ ahịa na-ewi ewi bụ ndị e wubechara n'iji eluụlọ taịlị-uhie keọdịnala..."" This directly describes red-tiled roofs as a characteristic of Izmir.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nnukwu boulevard:** While the passage mentions broad boulevards, it doesn't present them as a defining *characteristic* that sets Izmir apart.
*   **B: Ụlọ ndị nwere karama n'ihu ha:** This is a detail of the architecture, but the *red tile roofs* are what are specifically mentioned as a traditional element.
*   **C: Nnukwu ụlọ ahịa:** The passage mentions the 19th-century bazaar, but doesn't emphasize large department stores as a key feature of Izmir.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọnọdụ ikuku dị na Turkey**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage describes Izmir's geographical location as being surrounded by a large bay and mountains, and having a Mediterranean European feel.** It does *not* mention the general climate of Turkey.
*   **A: Nnukwu ọnụ mmiri gbara ya gburugburu** - The passage explicitly states Izmir is built around a large bay.
*   **C: Enwere ike ịhụ ma ụlọ ahịa azụmaahịa nke oge a na ụlọ ụka akụkọ ihe mere eme** - The passage mentions both modern shops and historical mosques and churches.
*   **D: Ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri dị na Turkey bụ nke abụọ kasị ukwuu** - The passage says Izmir has the second busiest port in Turkey (after Istanbul).



"
"""Kedu ihe a na-ahụ mgbe ejiri okwu """"hanami"""" mee ihe?""","The correct answer is **A: Ifuru cheri**.

The passage states: ""Nlere ifuru Cheri, nke a maara dị ka hanami..."" which translates to ""The cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami..."" Therefore, hanami is directly related to cherry blossoms."
Ònye haziri nnọkọ mbụ maka ikiri ifuru cherry?,"The correct answer is **C: Alaeze Ukwu Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Na Japan, Onye eze Emperọ haziri mmemme mkpụrụ osisi cheri izizi..."" which translates to ""In Japan, the Emperor organized the first cherry blossom viewing...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Eze ukwu China** - The passage states the *concept* originated in China, but the actual first viewing in Japan was organized by the Japanese Emperor.
*   **B: Ndị isi Japan** - While other leaders were present, the passage specifically mentions the *Emperor* as the organizer.
*   **D: Ndị isi China** - The passage states the idea came *from* China, not that Chinese leaders organized the event in Japan.

"Kedu n'ime njirimara ndị na-esonụ nke Jerusalem nwere ike ịrata ndị njem nlegharị anya, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Okpukpe dị mkpa maka obodo**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Nihi mputa-ihe okpukpere-chi nke mba ahu, ya na kpom-kwem otutu ogbe nke obodo ochie ogbe ahu, Jerusalem bu ot nime ebe bu isi nke njem-nlere-anya na Israel."" This directly translates to ""Because of the religious significance of the country, and with the convergence of many communities of the old city, Jerusalem is one of the main destinations for tourism in Israel.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ịbụ isi obodo Israel:** While the text states Jerusalem is considered the capital by Israel, it also acknowledges many countries don't recognize this. This is a political point, not necessarily a draw for tourists from all backgrounds.
*   **C: Onyinye n'ihe gbasara omenala:** The text mentions cultural aspects, but highlights religious significance as the primary reason for tourism.
*   **D: Ọtụtụ ebe akụkọ ihe mere eme:** The text states there are many historical and cultural sites, but it’s the *religious* aspect that’s directly linked to its status as a major tourist destination.



"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-akọwaghị dịka njirimara Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **B: Ike ọchịchị** (Political status).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Jerusalem is a city with a rich, ancient history and significant religious importance. It's a major tourist destination with historical sites, cultural areas, and vibrant commerce. However, it explicitly points out that its status as Israel’s capital is *not* universally recognized.

*   **Why the other options are mentioned in the passage:**
    *   **A: Akụkọ na-akpali mmasị** (Fascinating history) - The passage directly mentions ""akụkọ ihe gara aga ruru ọtụtụ puku afọ nke na-adọrọ mmasị.""
    *   **C: Mkpa okpukperechi** (Religious significance) - The passage highlights its importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
    *   **D: Ebe akụkọ ihe mere eme** (Historical sites) - The passage mentions numerous historical and cultural sites.

*   **Why 'Ike ọchịchị' is not mentioned as a characteristic:** The passage focuses on its history, religious importance, and tourism aspects, but acknowledges its *disputed* political standing. The political status itself is presented as a point of contention, not a defining characteristic.

Here's why:

* The text states the Wild Card gives access to Kruger *and* other SANParks parks. Therefore, someone planning to visit *all* SANParks would definitely benefit from the Wild Card.
* The other options all could benefit from the Wild Card:
    * **B:** Someone just passing through Kruger would still need to pay a daily conservation fee without the card.
    * **C:** The Wild Card is designed for people concerned about conservation fees.
    * **D:** The Wild Card would be a good value if visiting multiple parks.

The question asks which type of traveller *wouldn’t* benefit. Only someone specifically visiting *all* SANParks would already be covered by the Wild Card's core function.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ogige a ruru 19,500 km²..."" This indicates it's a *large* park, not the smallest.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: A na-ewere ya dị ka ebe kachasị elu na South Africa:** The passage says it's ""a na-ewe ya dị ka nke kacha mma nke Ebennọkọta Nkeobodo (SANParks) Ndịda Afrịka"" which suggests it is highly regarded.
*   **B: Ụmụ anụmanụ dị na ogige ahụ dị iche iche:** The passage mentions ""ụdịrị anụ ọhịa dị iche"" which means there is a variety of animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmiri ozuzo ihu igwe** - While the passage mentions it can be wet and slippery, it doesn't directly state the weather itself is a hazard.
*   **B: Nzọụkwụ e ji nkume mee** - The passage doesn't mention steps made of stone.
*   **D: ígwè cables** - The passage mentions cables are used for support, but doesn’t suggest they themselves are dangerous."

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""A na-etinye ọtụtụ okwute n'okporo ụzọ, na mpaghara ala nke eriri igwe na - enye aka ijide onwe gi ofuma."" This directly contradicts the statement that there are no handholds in the steep sections. The ropes are there to help you hold on.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Ọbụna ndị nwere ahụmahụ na-arị elu nwere ike ịnwe ume iku ume** - The passage states it takes strong people 45 minutes to climb, implying it's difficult and can be tiring.
*   **C: N'elu ugwu, ị ga-agarịrị n'ọgba** - The passage says, ""Enwere obere ọgba dị nso n’elu a na-aga-agaferịrị, ọ dị ala ma na-agbatị karịa.""

"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe a ma ama na nri Majorcan, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ọka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Majorcans rely on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and use olive oil frequently.
* **Looking at the options:**
    * **A: Anụ (Meat)** - The passage specifically mentions meat, especially pork.
    * **B: Achịcha (Bread)** - The passage specifically mentions bread.
    * **C: Ọka (Rice)** - Rice is *not* mentioned in the passage as a staple of Majorcan cuisine.
    * **D: Vegetables** - The passage specifically mentions vegetables.

Therefore, rice is the one item *not* mentioned as a common component of Majorcan food."

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Wellington na-enye hangi nke ejiri okwute ọkụ mee** - The text says hangi can be found in Wellington.
* **C: A na-ejikarị hangi akwadebe nri a ṅara n'ọkụ** - The text specifically says hangi is ""A na-ejikarị hangi ahụ isi nri abalị otu ụdị ahụrụahụ keọdịnala."" (often used to cook traditional food).

"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-akpọghị usoro ikpo ọkụ hangi olulu ọkọlọtọ?,"The correct answer is **A: gas**.

Here's why:

The passage states hangi involves cooking food in earth ovens heated by:

*   **Rocks heated by fire** (from wood)
*   **Geothermal heat** (heat from the earth itself)

The options B, C and D are all mentioned in the text as methods of heating hangi. Gas is not mentioned.

Therefore, **gas** is the one thing *not* used in traditional hangi cooking as described in the passage."

The passage states: ""...tụmadị nke nwere agba chapụrụ achapụ, ị ga enweta otu mmụmụ ọnụ ọchị sitere na mọnk ma ọ bụ nọn nọ n'ọnụ ụzọ."" This directly translates to getting a smile (a sign of respect) from a monk or nun by bringing a beautiful covering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ubu gi ekpuchiriwo:** While covering your knees is *required*, it doesn't earn you extra respect.
*   **C: Na-ewere blanketị site na ebe obibi ndị mọnk:** Taking a blanket is not mentioned as something that would earn respect; in fact, it would likely be considered disrespectful.
*   **D: Na-eyi uwe mwụda dị elu karịa ikpere:** The passage discusses skirts/trousers covering the knees, not clothing above the knees.

Kedu uwe ndị a na-atụghị anya ka a ga-enye maka mbinye ego site na ebe obibi ndị mọnk? ,"The correct answer is **A: Uwe elu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that monasteries provide ""shawls to cover women who arrive unprepared"". Shawls are a type of *uwe elu* (outer garment/shawl). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uwe mkpụkpọ** - The passage does not mention shorts.
*   **C: Uwe elu** - While this is similar to the correct answer, the passage specifically mentions ""shawls"" which fall under the *uwe elu* category.
*   **D: Kechie** - The passage references *sket* (wrappers/skirts) and *traụza* (trousers), not ""kechie"".

"Mgbe ọ na-eme njem n'akụkụ ụfọdụ nke Antarctica, olee mgbe onye njem ga-enwe ohere kacha mma ịhụ kpakpando?","The correct answer is **C: Oge oyi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that experiencing a polar night (where the sun doesn't rise) provides a better opportunity to see stars because the sky is darker. Polar nights occur during the winter (ogi oyi) in the Arctic and Antarctic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'oge okpomọkụ:** The passage implies darkness is *better* for stargazing, and summer has more daylight.
*   **B: Mgbe mpaghara na-adịchaghị mma:** This doesn't relate to the visibility of stars.
*   **D: N'oge oge mmetọ dị obere:** The passage mentions that light pollution isn't usually a problem in these remote locations *because* they are sparsely populated, not due to a specific time of year.

Kedu mgbe ọ na-agaghị ekwe omume iji ekwentị satịlaịtị n'ọnọdụ ekwentị mkpanaaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụrụ na ihe mgbochi nwere ike ịdị na ụzọ anya nke satịlaịtị dị** (If there's an obstruction in the satellite's line of sight).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you need a clear view of the satellite to make a call. Obstructions like buildings, trees, or mountains would block that view, rendering the satellite phone useless.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ bụrụ na ntọala dị oke anya** (If the settings are too extreme) - The passage doesn't mention anything about settings.
*   **C: Ma a ga-eji ya mee ihe n'èzí** (Whether it needs to be used outside) - While satellite phones are *often* used outdoors for a clear view, it's not a limitation. You could potentially use one indoors near a window.
*   **D: Ọ bụrụ na ozi na-akpọ maka ụfọdụ data** (If the message calls for specific data) - The passage mentions data needs for expeditions, but doesn't say it *prevents* use.



"
Kedu mgbe ọ ka mma iji ekwentị satịlaịtị kama iji ekwentị mkpanaaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ị na-eleta obodo na ezumike**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions satellite phones are useful ""n'ebe ndị zopuru ezopu, n'enweghị netwọk ekwentị"" (in remote areas, without cell phone networks). Visiting a remote area on vacation would be a prime example of a situation where a satellite phone would be necessary. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mgbe na njem nlegharị anya ụgbọ mmiri:** While useful, the passage highlights areas *without* network coverage, and boats often have some form of communication (radio, potential cell service near shore).
* **C: Mgbe achọghị ka iji data dị anya:** The passage says satellite phones are for when you *need* data in remote locations, not when you *don't*.
* **D: Mgbe o yikarịrị ka ị ga-enwe mkpuchi mkpanaka zuru oke:** This is the opposite of when you’d need a satellite phone – they're for when you *don't* have cell coverage.



"
E hiwere Transnistria Republic n'ihi esemokwu nke kedu n'ime ndị a?,"The correct answer is **B: Agbụrụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In 1994, tensions resulting from ethnic divisions led to the declaration of the Transnistria Republic's independence within eastern Moldova."" 

This directly links the formation of Transnistria to **ethnic divisions**. The text mentions Moldova is a multi-ethnic country and the conflict arose from those divisions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akụ na ụba** - The passage does not mention economic or wealth related disputes as the cause.
*   **C: Asụsụ** - While the passage notes different languages are spoken, it states the tensions came from *ethnic* divisions, not just language.
*   **D: Okpukpe** - The passage mentions the dominant religion but doesn't link religious disputes to the formation of Transnistria.



"
"N'adịghị ka ndị Moldova ndị ọzọ, olee otu n'ime ihe ndị a pụrụ iche na Transnistria Republic?  ","The correct answer is **C: Nnabata UN**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the Transnistria Republic ""has its own government and currency but has not been recognized by any UN member."" This is the defining characteristic that sets it apart from the rest of Moldova, which *is* attempting to gain international recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asụsụ** - The text says Romanian is the official language of Moldova but Russian is commonly used, it doesn't mention a different language being used in Transnistria.
*   **B: Okpukpe** - The text only states the predominant religion in Moldova generally, not specifically in Transnistria.
*   **D: Ego** - While Transnistria has its own currency, that's mentioned as a fact *about* it, not what makes it uniquely different from Moldova as a whole."
Edemede a na-atụ aro oge dị mma iji gaa Montevideo ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ịnọpụ na ikuku?,"The correct answer is **A: N'oge oyi nke Northern Hemisphere**.

Here's why:

The passage states that it is summer in Montevideo when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere.  The question asks when to go to escape the cold, so the opposite season in the Northern Hemisphere (winter) would coincide with the warm summer in Montevideo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mgbe ihu igwe kpọrọ nkụ na Montevideo** - The passage does *not* suggest going when the weather is rainy in Montevideo. It says rainfall is consistent year-round.
*   **C: Mgbe oge okpomọkụ na-arị elu na Northern Hemisphere** - This would be the *hottest* time in Montevideo, not a time to escape cold weather.
*   **D: N'oge oyi na Montevideo** - This would be the coldest time *in* Montevideo, exactly what you'd want to avoid.

"Kedu mgbe mmadụ kwesịrị ịga Montevideo ma ọ bụrụ na ọ na-ahọrọ okpomọkụ dị jụụ, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Mgbe Northern Hemisphere bụ n'oge okpomọkụ ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ebe Montevideo dị na ndịda Iquetọ, ọ bụ oge ọkọchị ebe ahụ mgbe oge oyi dị na Ebe ugwu Emisfee ma n'otu aka ahụ.""

This directly means Montevideo has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa. If someone wants warm weather, they should go when the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Montevideo n'oge okpomọkụ:** While true, it doesn't specify *when* Montevideo's summer is relative to other parts of the world.
*   **C: Mgbe oge mmiri ozuzo Montevideo na-arụ ọrụ:** The passage says rainfall is consistent year-round, so this isn't a good indicator of warm weather.
*   **D: N'oge mmiri ozuzo na Montevideo:**  Same as above - rainfall doesn't relate to warm temperatures."

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts the destructive act of vandalism (graffiti as a destructive force) with the more artistic and sanctioned creation of murals and art events.** It states that modern art often happens *within* rules and laws.  The author implies a preference for the skill and artistry of legitimate art over destructive tagging.
* **""Ihe omume metụtara ihe odide""** directly relates to both the destructive (vandalism) and constructive (murals, art events) aspects of this discussion.  A famous artist would be more involved in the *events related to graffiti* as art, not the illegal tagging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ide ederede (Writing)** - While artists might write, it's not the core focus of the passage's comparison.
* **C: Mgbidi dị n'ihe onwunwe ọha na-achọghị (Unsolicited public walls)** - This describes the *target* of vandalism, not the artist themselves.  The passage is about the artist's *action* and whether it's destructive or artistic.
* **D: Mkpado enweghị ike ịgụ (Illegible scribbles)** - This describes the *quality* of some graffiti, specifically the problematic tagging, and doesn't relate to an artist's overall work.

Kedu ihe ụfọdụ ndị bịaranụ chere na ọ bụ akụkụ dị mkpa nke ahụmahụ na ememme egwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogige ndị dị nso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...many of the attendees took it as a vital part of the experience."" and then goes on to say: ""if you want to be close to the action you will need to queue to secure a pitch in the campsite near the music.""

This directly links attendees considering staying in the campsite as a key part of the experience *because* it allows them to be close to the music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ọnụnọ nke obere ụmụaka** - The passage mentions family camping areas, but doesn't say attendees considered children's presence a vital part of the experience.
*   **C: ịrụ ọrụ egwu abalị** - While the passage mentions the festival going late into the night, it doesn't state that this was considered a vital part of the experience by attendees.
*   **D: Na-abịa ngwa ngwa** - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ị ga-ekwesị ịbanye ọsịịsọ iji nweta otu ebe a na-ama ụlọikwu nọ nso n'egwu ahụ."" This directly translates to needing to book in advance to secure a campsite close to the music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ibi n'ime agbata obi nwere enyi (Living in harmony with friends)** - This isn't related to campsite booking.
*   **C: Na-ama ụlọikwuu pụọ n'ụlọ (Camping away from home)** - While true, it doesn't address *how* to get a good spot.
*   **D: Na-abịa ngwa ngwa (Arriving early)** - The passage emphasizes *booking*, not just arriving early. Though arriving early might help if spots are still available, booking is the primary method mentioned.

"Ebee na ugwu New Mexico ndị njem nleta kwesịrị izere mgbe ha na-achọ ndụ abalị, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: ụlọ mmanya agbata obi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""ụlọ mmanya ndị obere abụghị ebe dị mma ka onye mbịa mbịa nọrọ."" This directly translates to ""small bars are not good places for visitors to be."" The passage connects these small bars to problems with drunk driving and safety issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The passage says it's hard to find nightlife *without* going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe, implying pueblos lack it, but doesn't say to *avoid* them.
*   **C: Ụlọ ahịa (Stores):** The passage doesn't mention stores.
*   **D: Ụlọ cha cha (Dance halls):** The passage doesn't mention dance halls.



"
"Ebee n'ebe ugwu New Mexico onye njem nwere ike ịhụ ihe ntụrụndụ ndị a ma ama, ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ ihe ederede na-ekwu?","The correct answer is **C: Ụlọ cha cha dị nso na Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many of the casinos (and therefore entertainment) are located near Albuquerque and Santa Fe, and specifically mentions that the more well-known establishments are closer to Santa Fe. ""Cha cha"" is likely referring to casinos/entertainment venues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: awa abụọ site na Albuquerque, na cha cha:** While entertainment is around Albuquerque, the text highlights proximity to *Santa Fe* more.
*   **B: Na pueblo dị anya:** The text implies entertainment is *not* easily found in remote pueblos.
*   **D: N'ụlọ mmanya dị n'ógbè ahụ:** The passage explicitly warns against small bars, stating they are not ideal for visitors and contribute to drunk driving issues.



"
Kedu ụdị mmanya ndị njem nlegharị anya na mmefu ego siri ike ga-achọ ịnọpụ na ya?,"The correct answer is **B: Mmiri mkpọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Enwere ọtụtụ mmanya si Frans mmadụ ga-aṅụ, mana mmanya Niu Ziland na Ọstrelia ga-aka mma maka njem."" This implies that French wines are potentially more expensive or less suitable for travel, meaning someone on a budget/looking to avoid high costs should steer clear of them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmanya si Australia:** The passage specifically recommends Australian wines *for* travel.
*   **C: Mpaghara ime biya:** The passage mentions specific beers (""Number One"", ""Manta"") but doesn’t suggest avoiding them.
*   **D: Ihe ọṅụṅụ mere site na mkpụrụ osisi:** The passage states fruit liqueurs are expensive but good, not that they should be avoided.



"
Kedu n'ime iwu ihe ọṅụṅụ ndị a nwere ike ịghọtahie onye na-echere na ọnọdụ a kọwara n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **A: Shọt blak**.

Here's why:

* **Shọt blak:** The text clarifies that ""shọt blak"" is equivalent to ""espresso"". Someone unfamiliar with Australian/New Zealand slang might be confused by the term and not realize it's simply a shot of espresso.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to cause confusion:

* **Otu Nọmba Mbụ:** The text *introduces* this drink, explaining what it is. There's no pre-existing expectation to be confused.
* **Sitere na New Zealand, Sauvignon Blanc:** While the text doesn't *specifically* mention Sauvignon Blanc, it does suggest New Zealand wines are good for travel. Someone familiar with wine generally would understand this is a type of wine.
* **Flat white:** The text *explains* that a flat white is a common coffee drink in Australia. It's a key point of comparison to other coffee types.



"
"Kedu ebo malitere oge ọchịchị, nke were narị afọ atọ?","The correct answer is **D: Ndị Spanish**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndị Spen bidoro oge ọchịchị ike nke digidere ruo narị afọ atọ."" This directly translates to ""The Spanish began a period of domination that lasted for three centuries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Payaguá** - The Payaguá are an indigenous group mentioned as living in the Chaco region, not the group that started the period of domination.
*   **B: A Guaycur** - Guaycur are another indigenous group, not the colonizers.
*   **C: Obodo Guatemala** - Guatemala is a different country, not related to the history of Paraguay as described in the text.



"
"Kedu ụzọ kacha mma iji merie onye Parisi, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Nwee nkwanye ùgwù**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the best way to navigate Paris is to be at your best behavior and to act as someone who is ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered). It also suggests that rudeness from Parisians will cease if you show ""some common politeness."" This directly equates to having respect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gbalịa ịmụta echiche ndị Parisi** - While understanding Parisian culture is helpful, the passage doesn't focus on adopting their beliefs, but on *how to behave* around them.
*   **B: Gosipụta mmesi obi ike** - The text actually implies the opposite – that rudeness will be met with more rudeness.
*   **D: Gosi omume ịpụ apụ** - This isn't mentioned in the passage and would likely not be helpful in navigating social situations.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị àgwà ndị Parisi, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ịgba aghara** (Rudeness).

Here's why:

The passage states that Parisians have a ""strong character"" and can be ""difficult."" It then advises behaving with good manners (""bien élevé"") to make getting around Paris easier, and that ""bad behavior"" from Parisians will stop if you show some politeness. This implies Parisians are *capable* of rudeness, but it's discouraged by politeness. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mpako** (Pride) - The passage directly mentions Parisians having a ""strong character"", which equates to pride.
*   **C: Egwuregwu egwu** (Playfulness) - While not explicitly mentioned, it's not presented as a negative trait, and doesn't clash with the description.
*   **D: Mberede** (Suddenness/Abruptness) -  This aligns with the described ""strong character"" and potential difficulty.

Therefore, the passage is suggesting to avoid *being* rude to Parisians, implying that rudeness is not a desirable or expected trait *from* them (though it may be encountered)."
Kedu uru dị na ịnya klaasị mbụ na MetroRail na Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke ndị mmadụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""MetroPlus...has fewer people than Metro."" MetroPlus is the higher class option (like first class). Therefore, a benefit of traveling on MetroPlus is having fewer passengers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụgbọ oloko ahụ na-ebute ụzọ** - The passage doesn't mention anything about speed or being first.
*   **C: E jiri ya tụnyere tiketi klaasị atọ, ọ dị obere ọnụ** - The passage states MetroPlus is *more* expensive than Metro (the other class), though cheaper than European metro tickets.
*   **D: Ọnụ ego ya na nke tiketi ụgbọ oloko** - The passage does not compare the cost to general train tickets, just to other metro options and European metros."
"Kedu ihe dị n'ọdụ ụgbọ oloko ọ bụla na Cape Town, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ndị nkuzi nke mbụ na nke atọ** (First and third class coaches).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụgbọ oloko ọ bụla nwere ma MetroPlus ma Koochi gasị"" (Each train has both MetroPlus and Koochi coaches).  ""Koochi MetroPlus ndị ahụ na-anọkarị n’ọdụ nke ụgbọ oloko kacha nso na Cape Town"" (MetroPlus coaches are usually located at the stations closest to Cape Town). This means stations near Cape Town will have both MetroPlus (first class) and Koochi (third class) coaches available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ụgbọ ala metro nke na-ebuchaghị ibu** (unloaded metro vehicles) - The passage doesn't mention anything about unloaded vehicles.
*   **B: otu ọnụahịa maka ụdị tiketi abụọ ahụ** (a single price for both ticket types) - The passage explicitly says MetroPlus is *more* expensive.
*   **C: ọkwa klaasị atọ dị iche iche** (three different class levels) - The passage only mentions two: MetroPlus and Koochi."
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị ekwe omume ka ahụhụ anụmanụ mee?,"The correct answer is **D: Mepụta ike na-egbu mgbu (Produce painful force)**.

* **The passage states:** ""ụmụ anụmanụ dị egwu nwere ike imerụ ma ọ bụ gbuo mmadụ n’ike, a na-ghị etozukarị oke dị ka ụmụ ahụhụ a na-achọghị."" (dangerous animals can injure or kill people with force, it is not usually the extent that these pests are sought after.) This implies pests generally *don't* focus on using strong force.  They cause problems through other means like spoiling food, allergic reactions, or spreading disease.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible based on the passage:

* **A: Mee otu n'amaghị ama (Be unseen/unknown):** The first sentence directly states pests can be present without people knowing.
* **B: Allergy adịla njọ (Cause severe allergies):** The passage specifically mentions pests can cause allergic reactions.
* **C: Ọrịa na-agbasa (Spread disease):** The passage explicitly states pests can spread diseases.

Therefore, creating painful force is the least likely behavior described for pests according to the provided text."
Ebee ka m nwere ike nweta kaadị ekwentị akwụgoro ụgwọ?,"The correct answer is **C: ụlọ ahịa nkuku**.

The passage states: ""Ahịa nkuku juputara na kaadị mkpọtụ ekwentị akwụgo ụgwọ..."" which directly translates to ""Grocery stores are filled with prepaid phone cards..."""
Kedu otu ọ ga-esi kwe omume ịnata ọnụego oku kacha mma ụfọdụ kaadị na-enye?,"The correct answer is **B: Site n'enyemaka nke ọnụọgụ ego efu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that special features of some cards involve lower rates to certain cities and that these opportunities are accessed ""by dialing toll-free numbers that can be dialed from many of the phones without charge.""  This directly supports the idea that using the free numbers is the key to getting the better rates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naanị ụfọdụ mba nwere ike ịnweta ha** - The passage doesn't mention any geographic restrictions.
* **C: N'ime ụlọ ahịa nkuku** - While the passage mentions phone cards being *sold* in convenience stores, it doesn't say you *get* the better rates there.
* **D: Site n'ịkpọ oku na ekwentị akwụ ụgwọ ma nweta ụgwọ** - The passage states the special rates are accessed *through* toll-free numbers, and the benefit is *avoiding* charges.



"
"Kedu otu n'ime osisi ndị a na-adịkarị obere na ogige ntụrụndụ mba nke Plitvice Lakes, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Fir**.

The passage explicitly states that the national park has forests containing beech, spruce, *and fir*. While the passage doesn't specify which is the smallest, fir is listed as one of the tree types present. The other options (oak and spruce) are also listed, but the question asks for *one* of the trees, and fir is a direct answer from the text. The option 'osisi siri ike' is not a specific tree type."
Kedu n'ime anụ ọhịa ndị a na-adịghị ahụkebe nwere ike ịhụ na Plitvice Lakes National Park?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""nwamba oke ọhịa linz"" and ""capercaillie"" as uncommon animals you can find in Plitvice Lakes National Park. ""Nwamba oke ọhịa linz"" translates to ""western capercaillie"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Toro toro:** This animal isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Agba mmanụ aṅụ:** This animal isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Cassowary:** Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea, and aren't found in Europe.

"Kedu ihe koodu mpaghara na-enyere aka n'ezie, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Ike n'elu ahịa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uru ọ bara n'ezie bụ ịme ka ụlọ ọrụ gasị nwee ikikere ebe ahịa ha nọ; Ihe a na-ele anya bụ ị na-esere ego dịka mmiri.""  This directly translates to the benefit being to allow companies to have dominance in their markets; the goal is to charge money like water. This highlights a market power advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mpempe diski (Disk copies)** - While disk copies are *mentioned* in relation to the legality of copies, they aren't what the regional code *helps* with.
*   **C: Usoro mgbochi mgbochi (Anti-circumvention systems)** - The passage discusses how these systems don't actually prevent copying.
*   **D: Nnomi na-enweghị ikike (Unauthorized fees)** - This is a *result* of the market power, not what the code enables.



"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara koodu mpaghara bụ ụgha ma ndị ụlọ ọrụ mgbasa ozi na-agbasa, n'akụkụ a?","The correct answer is **D: Ha anaghị enye aka n'ịkwụsị ohi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that regional codes have *no effect* on copyright infringement; disk copies would be perfectly legal on any machine where a legitimate copy exists.  This directly contradicts the idea that they help to stop piracy (or ohi).  The passage argues their *true* benefit is securing market share for the companies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A chọrọ ha ka ha gbasaa ike ahịa** – The passage *supports* this, saying the benefit is to allow companies to maintain dominance in their markets.
*   **B: Ha na-enye aka n'igbochi piracy** – The passage *denies* this, stating they have no effect on infringement.
*   **C: Ha na-enye aka maka ịtụgharị mkpụrụ ego** – The passage uses the phrase “esere ego dịka mmiri”, suggesting they do enable revenue generation.



"
Kedu usoro a na-emekarị mgbe ị na-abanye na obodo gị?,"The correct answer is **D: Njikwa nke kọstọm** (Customs control).

Here's why:

The passage directly discusses the potential issues with customs control (""njikwa ndị kọstọm"") when entering a country, emphasizing the need to be aware of what you're allowed to bring and to declare anything prohibited.  The entire passage revolves around dealing with customs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Elele maka mbata na ọpụpụ** (Immigration and emigration checks) - While mentioned, it's presented as a general issue, not the main focus of the advice. The passage goes *beyond* simple immigration/emigration.
*   **B: Ihe ekwuputara** (Declarations) - This is a *part* of dealing with customs, but not the overall process.
*   **C: Ọnụ ahịa iwu kachasị nke ngwaahịa** (Legal price of goods) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes knowing **what you are allowed to bring** and **declaring anything that is prohibited**. This directly relates to understanding if your items are acceptable for entry into the country.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A:** The passage *mentions* checks, but the core advice isn’t *knowing if* they exist, but being prepared for them.
*   **B:** This is related, but not the primary focus. The passage is about knowing rules *before* exceeding limits.
*   **C:**  The passage mentions customs control, but again, the key is knowing *what is allowed* under that control, not just that it exists.

This clearly indicates the abundance of large rock formations – walls – which climbers constantly find new routes on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Echiche (Ideas):** While climbers need ideas, the passage doesn't say ideas themselves are abundant *in the valley*.
* **B: Mgbakọ (Assemblages/Groups):** The passage doesn't focus on groups of anything.
* **C: Peaks (Peaks):** While there are peaks, the passage highlights the *walls* and routes *on* those formations, not the peaks themselves as the abundant feature.

"Kedu onye na-eme njem kachasị na Southern Hemisphere, dịka ozi nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Njikọ nke Stars (Star Alliance)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""However, Star Alliance covers everything south of the equator across the South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM airline flight."" This means Star Alliance has the most extensive coverage in the Southern Hemisphere, specifically with a route across a significant portion of the South Pacific.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam:** The text explicitly says SkyTeam doesn't cover any of the three oceanic crossings in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   **C: Ndịda Pacific:** This is a location, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: Ụwa nke LATAM:** While LATAM operates the flight *within* the Star Alliance coverage, LATAM itself isn't the alliance providing the broader coverage.



"
"Na Southern Hemisphere, kedu mmekorita ụgbọ elu na-enyefefe oke osimiri kacha nta?","The correct answer is **A: Njikọ nke Stars (Star Alliance)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndịda Pacific:** This is a geographical location, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: Ụwa nke LATAM:** While LATAM operates the flights, it's *within* the Star Alliance network for this route.

Kedu ụlọ ọrụ nlegharị anya dochie Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-agba ọsọ njem**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Global Running Tours *consists of* multiple companies like Running Tours Barcelona and Running Tours Copenhagen. It then states that these companies operate independently. Therefore, ""Na-agba ọsọ njem"" (Running Tours) is the broader category or umbrella organization encompassing those individual tours, acting as the replacement for Global Running Tours.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Igba ọsọ na Copenhagen** - This is just *one* of the tour companies within the Global Running Tours network, not the organization itself.
*   **C: Njem nlegharị anya ịgba ọsọ na Prague** - Same reasoning as A, this refers to a specific tour, not the encompassing organization.
*   **D: Njem na-agba ọsọ na Barcelona** - Same reasoning as A and C, this refers to a specific tour.

The passage states: ""...and united numerous running programs on **four** continents."" 

Therefore, the answer is four."
Kedu ka ndị njem nlegharị anya ga-esi bulie ohere ha nwere ịhụ agụ n'ụzọ doro anya?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaa na safari na-eje ije**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ọdụm, agụogbu na agụ na-eme ihere mgbe ụfọdụ ma ị ga-ahụ na nke ọma karịa n'iji baịnokụlaasị."" (Antelope, buffalo and lions are sometimes shy and you will see them better on a walking safari.)  A ""safari ngagharị"" (walking safari) is explicitly mentioned as a way to get a better view of these animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gagharịa n'ime ọhịa** - The text doesn't suggest wandering into the bush on your own.
*   **C: Jiri microscopes** - Microscopes are for viewing tiny objects, not large animals in the savanna.
*   **D: Were ụgbọ ala, ma jiri naanị ihe ndị bụ isi mee ihe** - While the text mentions vehicles, it doesn't say that *only* basic equipment is needed, and it specifically mentions binoculars *don't* work as well for shy animals.

"Kedu ụdị anụmanụ ọ ga-abụ na onye ọbịa ga-ezute mgbe ọ na-eme njem safari n'ime ụgbọ ala, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Enyí**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụmụanụmanụ ụfọdụ, dịka **enyi** ga na mgbara ga, na-abịaru nso n’ụgbọala..."" (Some animals, like **elephants** and giraffes, come close to the vehicle...).

While the passage also mentions lions, leopards, and buffalo, it *specifically* says elephants and giraffes approach the vehicles.
"
"Kedu ihe ga-eme njem nlegharị anya dị ọnụ ala, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Na-achịkọta otu quartet**.

Here's why:

The passage states that if you are traveling alone or with just one friend, you should *try to meet others and form a group of four to six people for a better per-person rate*.  ""Quartet"" means a group of four, which aligns with the advice given.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-akpụ akpụ n'onwe ya** (Going it alone) - The passage suggests *avoiding* this if you want the cheapest rate.
*   **C: Soro onye ibe ya na-aga** (Going with a partner) - While mentioned, the passage says you should aim for a larger group than just two.
*   **D: Na-achịkọta ndị ọrụ nke opekata mpe isii** (Assembling a team of at least six) - While a group of six is acceptable, the passage suggests 4-6 as the ideal range, not *at least* six."
"Kedu onye ga-akacha nweta ọnụahịa njem nlegharị anya kacha mma, dabere na ebe a?","The correct answer is **D: otu mmadụ ise**.

Here's why:

The passage states that cheaper rates are available for groups of four to six people. The passage also points out that people are often picked up to fill cars, suggesting the cheapest rate is achieved when you have a full group. Therefore, a group of five (which falls within the 4-6 range) is most likely to get the best per-person price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị njem na-adị njikere ịkwagharị ụgbọ ala** - This just describes a common practice, not a group getting the best price.
*   **B: Mmadụ atọ** - Three people are too few to qualify for the group discount.
*   **C: Ndị enyi abụọ na-agakọ ọnụ na njem ahụ** - Two people are also too few for the discount."
"Kedu ihe, n'ime ederede, San Francisco mere iji nweta nkwado mba ụwa?","The correct answer is **A: na-apụtakarị na mgbasa ozi dị iche iche na ụdị nka**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngosipụta ya ugboro ugboro n’egwu, ihe nkiri, edemede na omenaala ama ama nyere aka mee ka amata obodo ahụ na ihe nhụmaama ya n’ụwa niile.""  This directly explains how San Francisco gained international recognition - through frequent appearances in entertainment, film, literature, and famous cultural events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ụlọ mgbakọ mara mma:** While the text mentions beautiful venues, it doesn't say this is *why* it gained international recognition.
*   **C: Ụlọ ọrụ dị iche iche:** The text mentions industries, but focuses on employment, not international reputation.
*   **D: Ebe nri Eshia na-apụta:** The text highlights Asian cuisine but doesn't connect it to global recognition.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that several industries contribute to San Francisco's wealth:** ""Ngalaba ndị kachasị ewe ndị mmadụ n'ọrụ bụ ejemozi ọkachamara, gọọmenti, akụ, ahịa, na njem.""  It specifically lists *multiple* sectors, not just tourism.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Ọtụtụ ihe nkiri na akwụkwọ egosila ya:** The passage says ""Ngosipụta ya ugboro ugboro n’egwu, ihe nkiri, edemede na omenaala ama ama nyere aka mee ka amata obodo ahụ…""
* **B: Enwere otutu nri Asia:** The passage states ""San Fransisko so n'ebe kachasị mma iri nri ndị mba Eshia n'obodo: Nke mba Koria, Taị, India na Japaanụ.""

"Kedu ụdị onye njem, dabere na akụkụ ahụ, na-agaghị enweta uru site n'iji ọrụ onye ọrụ njem?","The correct answer is **B: Onye njem na-akwadoghị (The independent traveler)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the benefits of a travel agent for things like pre-booked accommodations, airport transfers, and assistance with things like visas. It also states that changes or cancellations are handled *through the travel agent*, not the hotel directly.

An ""independent traveler"" (onye njem na-akwadoghị) likely prefers to handle all these arrangements themselves. They wouldn't benefit from someone else booking for them, arranging transfers, or dealing with changes. They would rather have the flexibility to manage things on their own.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye njem ụjọ (An anxious traveler):** Travel agents specifically *provide* peace of mind, which would benefit an anxious traveler.
*   **C: Onye njem na -enwetabeghi visa ya (A traveler who hasn’t obtained their visa):** The passage specifically mentions travel agents can *help* with visas.
*   **D: Onye njem na-amasị ịzụ njem ngwungwu (A traveler who likes to buy package tours):** Travel agents often *offer* package tours.

Here's why:

The passage states travel agents often offer packages that *include* things like breakfast, airport transfers, and even assistance with visas.  This means they provide a **complete package** of services beyond just the hotel booking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngwa ngwa kwadebere akwụkwọ njem** - While likely true, the passage doesn't specifically emphasize speed as a benefit.
*   **B: Azụmahịa na hotels** - The passage states agents *have* agreements with hotels, but this isn't a benefit *to the traveler* specifically mentioned.
*   **D: Na-eme ndoputa** - The passage mentions agents can help with other bookings, but doesn’t emphasize the term “ndoputa” in the context of services.

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Njin nsụgharị asụsụ agbanweela nke ọma nke ukwu, ka ha na enyezi nsụgharị ziri ezi (makwa ndị bna enweghị isi ọtụtụ mgbe) mana okwesiri nleba anya, n'ihi na ha nwere ike ịda ya."" This directly translates to ""Language translation engines have improved significantly, offering accurate translations (but also inaccurate ones often) but should be used with caution, as they can fail."" This means 100% accuracy is *not* a guaranteed capability.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Akara ntụgharị asụsụ e dere n'asụsụ ndị ọzọ** – This is implied by the description of translating text from one language to another.
*   **B: A na-atụgharị asụsụ akụkụ ederede zuru oke** – The passage begins by defining these apps as being able to translate ""nkebi ngwe zuzu ezu"" (complete pieces of text).
*   **C: Iji smartphone iji tụgharịa okwu na ihe** – The passage mentions using a smartphone to translate signs or objects encountered while traveling.



"
Kedu ihe na-eme ka ịsụgharị akwụkwọ na-anọghị n'ịntanetị?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngwa ntụgharị asụsụ emelitere** (Improved language translation apps).

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""Ntụgharị Kegugulụ, nke na-enye ohere ime ntụgharị na-anọghị n'ịntanetị ka e budatachara asụsụ a chọrọ"" (Kegugulụ Translation, which allows for offline translation once the desired language is downloaded). This directly links offline translation to advancements in translation *apps*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ekwentị ndị amamihe** (Smart phones): While smartphones are *necessary* to run the apps, they don't *enable* offline translation. It's the app itself.
*   **C: Inweta ozi asụsụ** (Acquiring language information): This is a part of the process (downloading language packs), but it's not the *cause* of offline translation. The app using that information is.
*   **D: Ngwa ngwa nkọwa ngwa ngwa** (Fast explanation apps): This is irrelevant to the topic of translation.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe omume ndị a na-adịghị ebute oke mmiri?,"The correct answer is **A: Snow na-amị amị (Snow falling)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that avalanches happen when snow *accumulates* and becomes unstable.** A consistent, gentle snowfall doesn't inherently *destabilize* existing snowpack. While it adds to the total amount of snow, it doesn't necessarily trigger an avalanche on its own.
*   The passage specifically mentions:
    *   **Sunlight (Ihè anyanwụ)** melting snow and creating instability.
    *   **Rain (Snowfall ọzọ)** soaking into the snowpack, making it heavier and prone to sliding.
    *   **People (Ndi mmadu)** as potential triggers for avalanches.

Therefore, snowfall itself is a *part* of the conditions for an avalanche, but not a triggering *event* like the others listed. It's the accumulation and subsequent instability that matter, not just the falling of snow."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ebute oke mmiri ozuzo, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Na-enweghị arụ ọrụ, snow na-egbuke egbuke**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""mgbe ụfọdụ mmiri ozuzo sinoo na-ezokwu ọzọ..."" This translates to ""sometimes rain falls on snow..."" which is a key factor in causing avalanches according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ dịghị-snow mkpọda nke dị steepụ** - The passage mentions steep slopes are a *factor* in where avalanches occur, but doesn't say this *causes* them.
*   **C: Snow na-adaghị n'elu mkpọda dị nkọ** - The passage doesn't discuss snow not falling on slopes.
*   **D: Ndị mmadụ na-emetụghị ya, snow** - While the passage mentions humans can *trigger* avalanches, it doesn't say untouched snow is a cause.

"Mmiri na yogọt Kedu ihe bụ ihe ndabere nke curry, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Mmiri na yogọt**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""n'ime Ebe Ndịda Indịa na mpaghara ndị ọzọ dị n'akụkụ mmiri nke okpuru kọntinent ahụ, a na-ejikarị mmiri ara akị oyibo."" and ""ụmụ mpaghara imeala nke Ebe Ugwu Indịa na Pakistan, a na-ejikarị yogọọt n'ime ụmụ kọrị."" This directly answers the question of what the base of curry is, depending on the region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Herbs na flavorings:** While herbs and flavorings are *part* of curry, they aren't the base.
*   **C: Anụ ahụ na mmiri ara ehi aki oyibo:** Meat is often *in* curry, but not a base ingredient in all of them.
*   **D: Mepụta na mmiri ara ehi:** This is not mentioned in the text."
Kedu ihe curry a na-eji mmiri ara ehi aki oyi dochie oge ụfọdụ n'ebe ụfọdụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used."" This directly indicates that yogurt is used *instead* of coconut milk in certain regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anụ ahụ (Animal)** - The text doesn't mention replacing curry ingredients with animal products.
*   **B: Vegetables** - While vegetables are *in* curry, they aren't a replacement for an ingredient.
*   **D: Oge nri (Cooking time)** - Cooking time isn't an ingredient replacement.



"
Gịnị kpatara ugwu Transantarctic ji dị mkpa iji rute ala dị larịị?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọtụtụ mgbe, McMurdo ọdụ na-emechi.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the route goes *around* the Transantarctic Mountains and to the polar plateau because the road is slow. This implies an alternative - going *over* the mountains - would be faster, but isn't used. The reason isn't about the mountains themselves being dangerous (option B), or tractor capability (option C), or the Ross Sea being easier (option D). The most likely reason to go around instead of directly to a plateau is that a direct route *through* McMurdo Station is often unavailable, because it is closed.

Therefore, the need to circumvent the Transantarctic Mountains is because McMurdo Station, the starting point, frequently closes, forcing a longer route."
Kedu ihe ọkọlọtọ na-egosi n'akụkụ okporo ụzọ South Pole?,"The correct answer is **C: Oghere snow kpuchie**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sno ya kpụkọtara ọnụ nwere ọtụtụ oghere nke e jiri ọtụtụ ọkọlọtọ sụjuo ma mee akara."" This directly translates to ""Its snow surface has many holes marked by numerous flags.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụzọ dị na McMurdo Station** - While the road *starts* at McMurdo Station, the flags aren't *at* the station, they mark the road itself.
*   **B: Na-ebu mmanụ ụgbọala na traktọ** - This describes what *travels* on the road, not what marks it.
*   **D: Gburugburu mkpọda, akụkụ dị ize ndụ** - The passage mentions the route goes *around* mountains, but doesn’t describe it as dangerous, and flags are not for indicating dangerous areas.

Kedu ozi dị mkpa gbasara njem na South Africa nke a na-ahapụ na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ihe achọrọ maka visa dị iche dabere na obodo ahụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ihe ọchụchọ na Visa na-adà ọnụahịa dị iche site na mba ruo na mba ma metụta kwa site n’obodo i siri bịa."" (Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country and depend on your nationality).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage *does* mention road trips are good for seeing less-traveled sites, it's not the *key* information being highlighted.
* **C:** The passage actually contradicts this, saying ""ọ bụghị obodo niile gbara Sawụt Afrịka gburugburu kwụsiri ike dịka ha."" (not all neighboring countries are as stable).
* **D:** The passage recommends 4x4 vehicles but doesn't state it's a requirement for *all* road trips. It says they are needed for *some* places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iwu ahụ nwere ike ịdepụta ngwa enyemaka mberede n'ime ụgbọ ala:** While the passage mentions needing emergency equipment, it doesn't say *the law* lists it. It says each country has *specific laws* about required equipment.
* **B: Ọtụtụ ebe enwere ike iji ụgbọ ala mgbe niile, n'agbanyeghị na a tụrụ aro 4x4:** The passage says a 4x4 is *better* and *sometimes necessary* to access certain places. It doesn't suggest most places are easily accessible without one.
* **D: Ọ bụghị mba niile dị n'Ebe Ndịda Africa bụ ndị kacha mma maka njem:** The passage states that stability varies from country to country, which implies some are less suitable for travel, but it doesn’t state they aren’t “the best.” It's a nuance.



"
Kedu ihe ize ndụ nwere ike ịhapụ akpa gị n'echeghị ya n'akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **A: Enwere ike iwere ha**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Akpa na-enweghị onye na-elekọta ha na-abụ ihe ebumnuche maka izu ohi..."" (Unattended bags are targets for theft...). This directly addresses the risk of having your bag stolen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ị nwere ike ịmalite iburu ọgwụ n'amaghị ama** - The passage mentions the risk of *being* used as a drug mule, not *becoming* one yourself by leaving your bag unattended.
*   **C: Mmadụ nwere ike imehie ha maka nke onye ọzọ** - While possible, the text doesn't focus on this.
*   **D: Ndị ọchịchị nwere ike nyochaa ha ka ha bụrụ ịdọ aka ná ntị bọmbụ** - The passage states bags draw the attention of authorities *concerned about bombs*, but doesn't say they will be searched. It's the unattended nature itself that is the issue.

This directly answers the question about the consequences of drug offenses, including the possibility of the death penalty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mgbe ị na-eme njem na mba ofesi, ekwesịrị ịgbaso usoro nchekwa ndị ọzọ:** While true, this is a general statement and doesn't directly address the question about drug offenses.
* **C: Enwere ike iji nkịta zụrụ azụ ịchọpụta ọgwụ na-enweghị ịdọ aka ná ntị:** The passage mentions drug-sniffing dogs, but this isn't the main point in relation to the question.
* **D: Ọbụlagodi na ịnweghị ọgwụ n'ime akpa gị, ndị ọchịchị nwere ike ijide ha:** The passage warns about being framed as a drug mule, which is related, but doesn't directly answer the question about penalties for *offending* with drugs.

Here's why:

The passage suggests trying to *create* a special drink when relaxing at home. It specifically mentions coffee and chamomile tea as starting points, and hints at experimenting with seeds for new beverages.  Plain water (mmiri mmiri) isn't something you *make* or experiment with – it's simply water. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kọfị (Coffee):** The passage *mentions* coffee as something you already drink.
* **C: Ihe ọṅụṅụ (Drinks):** This is too broad. The passage focuses on *making* a special drink, not just generally consuming drinks.
* **D: Kọfị (Coffee):** Same as B - already mentioned as a base drink.

The passage specifically states: ""Ọ bụrụ na i bi n’obodo nwere ọdịnala ịn̄ụ mmanya dị iche iche, gaa n'ụlọ mmanya ma ọ bụ ebe ịn̄ụ mmanya na mpaghara ị na-anaghị aga ọtụtụ oge."" This translates to ""If you live in a town known for drinking, go to a bar or drinking establishment in an area you don't frequent.""  Option C directly reflects this suggestion – going to a drinking establishment you typically avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na mpụga agbataobi gị, enwere ụlọ ahịa kọfị** - The passage mentions coffee at the *beginning* as something to do in the morning, not specifically when in a town known for drinking.
*   **B: Na-echekwa maka smoothies ma ọ bụ ihe ọṅụṅụ** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ebe a na-eri ihe na-eme tii chamomile** - Chamomile tea is mentioned for a relaxing evening, not in relation to a town's drinking culture.



"
Ebee ka ahụrụ ihe oyiyi nduru?,"The correct answer is **B: N'ebe a na-eli ozu** (In the graveyard).

The passage states: ""Na yaadị ụlọ ụka, e nwere ụmụ nduru akpụrụ n’ofe ụfọdụ ili na-adọrọ mmasị."" This directly translates to ""In the churchyard, there are sculptures of seals across some attractive graves.""  A graveyard is a place where people are buried, and a churchyard is a graveyard associated with a church.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ụgbọala nkeji iri atọ site n'obodo nta ahụ** (thirty-minute drive from the small town) - The drive is to get *to* the town, not where the seals are located.
*   **C: Na Eysturoy, agwaetiti ahụ** (On Eysturoy, the island) - While the town can *see* Eysturoy, the seals aren't necessarily *on* the island.
*   **D: N'ime ụka** (Inside the church) - The seals are in the *churchyard*, not the church itself."
Kedu ụdị visa ga-achọ ka mmadụ gosipụta nkwado ego zuru oke?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ụmụ akwụkwọ**.

This directly links student visas to the requirement of demonstrating sufficient financial support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Visa ọrụ:** The passage contrasts student visas *with* work visas, implying different requirements.
*   **B: Visa onye njem nkịtị:** The passage states this visa type is different from student visas regarding requirements.
*   **C: Visa obere oge:** The passage suggests short-term visas don't automatically require the same level of financial proof as longer stays, especially for study.



"
Kedu onye o yikarịrị ka ọ ga-achọ mgbakwunye visa ha?,"The correct answer is **C: Nwa akwụkwọ kọleji si mba ofesi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that studying abroad implies a longer stay and therefore, a different visa requirement than a typical tourist or business traveler. It details the requirements for a student visa (proof of acceptance, financial support for at least a year of study) and contrasts it with other visa types.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye njem ugboro ugboro (Frequent traveler):** While frequent travel *might* eventually necessitate a visa depending on the countries and length of stays, the passage doesn't focus on this.
*   **B: ọkachamara njem (Travel expert):**  Their expertise doesn't change their visa needs.
*   **D: Onye ọchụnta ego (Business person):** The passage mentions business travel as a short-term stay that *might* not require a visa, but doesn't suggest they are more likely to need one than others.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions being cautious of sunburn during the summer (""Karịchaa n'oge ọkọchị"").
*   The question asks *when* to be careful of sunburn.
*   Options B, C, and D are activities or locations, but the primary time factor emphasized in the passage is the season (summer/okpomọkụ)."

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically warns about insects following you *from the car*.** This implies that leaving the car door open for even a short time allows insects to enter and then follow you when you start your hike.
*   The passage does not mention the length of time a door needs to be open for insects to enter, but clearly states leaving the car unattended is the trigger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ogologo oge ejiri na ọnụ ụzọ ụgbọ ala meghere** (The length of time the car door is open) - While relevant, the passage doesn’t focus on *how long* the door is open, just that leaving it open in general is the issue.
*   **B: Ịga njem n'oge okpomọkụ** (Hiking in hot weather) - The passage mentions summer, but the issue isn't just the heat, it's the insects.
*   **C: Ka ị na-agagharị na mpaghara subtropical** (Traveling in subtropical areas) - This might be a location where insects are prevalent, but isn't the specific action mentioned in the passage as causing the problem.

Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara Sundarbans na-adakọghị na ozi dị na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ahịhịa na-ekpuchi ọkara nke mkpokọta mpaghara ya**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Sundabans kpuchiri ohere km² 3850, nke mmiri maọbụ ala apịtị kpuchiri otu ụzọ n'ụzọ atọ ya."" This means water or mangrove swamps cover approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the area, *not* half.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: A na-ahụ ụfọdụ n'ime oke ọhịa ndị siri ike fọdụrụ n'ebe ahụ** - The text says ""...ha gụnyekwara ihe ndị ka fọrọ site n'oke ọhịa ndị juburu Ala nọ na mpaghara Ganjiz."" which implies remnants of denser forests exist.
*   **C: Akara mangrove kacha ibu n'ụwa niile** - The passage identifies Sundarbans as ""ebe ala nwere ọhịa mmiri nọ n'akụkụ mmiri kachasị ukwuu n'ụwa dum"", strongly suggesting it contains the world's largest mangrove forest.
*   **D: Enwere mgbada ahụrụ anya ebe ahụ karịa agụ Bengal** - The text explicitly states: ""...ihe dika 30,000 mgbada nwere ntupo na ihe dika 400 Royal Bengal tiger..."" meaning there are significantly more deer than tigers.



"
Kedu mpaghara oke ọhịa dị na ala India?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""The portion of the forest within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wildlife sanctuary** - While Sundarbans *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the text identifies the specific park name.
*   **C: World-famous place** - This is true, but doesn't identify the specific forest area in India.
*   **D: Land of the Ganges** - This refers to the larger geographical region, not the specific forest area within India.

"Ònye, n'iburu n'uche paragraf ahụ, o yikarịrị ka ọ ga-enwe ma ọ dịkarịa ala iwu bụ isi nke asụsụ Bekee?","The correct answer is **B: Ndị ntorobịa**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""...in other countries, there will be people with little English - especially the young."" This directly implies that younger people are more likely to have limited knowledge of the common, global language (which the paragraph establishes is English). Therefore, they would be the ones *least* likely to have a strong grasp of the basics of the English language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndị nwere ike ikwukọrịta ma ọ dịkarịa ala n'asụsụ abụọ ọzọ:** The paragraph doesn’t say anything about multilingual people and their English proficiency.
* **C: Ndị na-aga Toronto:** The paragraph uses Toronto as an example of a place where people with different accents meet, but doesn't link visiting Toronto to lacking English skills.
* **D: Ndị agadi:** The paragraph explicitly states the *young* are the ones with less English.



"
"Kedu ihe nwere ike isi ike ikwu okwu, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Slang mpaghara**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that spoken language is often more difficult to understand than written language, and gives the example of people from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, and Sydney struggling to understand each other's accents and expressions while telling stories. This clearly points to **slang mpaghara** (regional slang/dialect) being the source of the difficulty in communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụda olu dị iche iche na nkebiokwu** (Different accents and intonation): While accents and intonation *contribute* to the difficulty, the passage is specifically highlighting the difficulty in understanding the *language* used, not just *how* it's said.
*   **B: Na-aza** (Answering): This doesn't relate to the text's point about communication difficulties.
*   **C: Asụsụ e dere ede** (Written language): The passage says written language is *easier* to understand, not harder.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""tụmadị ndị ahụ na-aga n'ebe ọwụwaanyanwụ na Jakar/Bumthang na-apụ n'etiti 06:30 na 07:30"" and ""ọ bụ ezi ndụmọdụ ịzụta otu tiketi ụbọchị ole na ole n'ọdịnihu."" 
* This means if you are going to Jakar (eastward), you should aim to depart between 6:30 and 7:30 and it's a good idea to buy your ticket in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While buses *to* Bumthang leave around that time, the paragraph doesn't say you *must* depart at 7 am.
* **C:** The paragraph mentions Paro and taxis, not buses, for nearby destinations and doesn't suggest leaving at 11 am.
* **D:** The paragraph states buses leave between 6:30-7:30, it doesn't suggest arriving before 6:20.

The passage states: ""Dị ka ụmụ bọọsụ njikọ-mpaghara na-ejukarị eju, ọ bụ ezi ndụmọdụ ịzụta otu tiketi ụbọchị ole na ole n'ọdịnihu."" This directly translates to ""As the inter-district buses are usually full, it is good advice to purchase a few day tickets in advance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbe 8:30 gasịrị, bọs na-apụ naanị** - The passage states buses *usually* leave between 6:30 and 7:30, and doesn't say they only leave after 8:30.
*   **C: Ọtụtụ ụgbọ ala na-apụ ụbọchị niile** - While buses run daily, the passage emphasizes they get full, so ""many"" isn't the key takeaway.
*   **D: Ikekwe ụdị njem kachasị ezi uche dị na ya bụ ụgbọ ala nkekọrịta** - The passage mentions taxis as a faster option for *shorter* distances, not the best option overall.

Kedu otu n'ime okwu ndị a kpọtụrụ aha na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụgbọ elu enweghị ike iru ebe ahụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...na o nwere otu ọdụ ụgbọelu"" (and it has one airport). This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Omenala Arab na-emetụta ya nke ukwuu karịa mba ndị ọzọ:** The text says ""...n'ihi na o nwere karịa mmasị nke Arabik karịa otu Onye Afrịka"" (because it has more of an Arabic influence than other African ones).
*   **B: Mpaghara dara ogbenye:** The passage refers to it as an ""obodo agụọ na-egbu"" (a poor, dying city) and being on a list of ""ebe ọpụrụiche n'ụwa ndị nọ na nsogbu mkpochapụ"" (special places in the world in danger of extinction), implying poverty.
*   **D: Ọ na-aga n'ihu na-adọta ndị ọbịa nwere mmasị:** The text mentions ""...agbanyeghị n'ugwu ya na-eme ya otu ndọta ndị nleta"" (despite its troubles, its history makes it a draw for visitors).



"
Kedu nke eziokwu Timbuktu na-abịa bụ nke ziri ezi?,"The correct answer is **A: From an airport, you can reach the city**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""na o nwere otu ọdụ ụgbọelu"" which translates to ""and it has an airport"". This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Instead of being poor, it is dangerous:** The passage says it's a ""town of murder,"" indicating danger, but doesn't contrast this with previous poverty. It's described as being once a symbol of distant, expensive lands, not necessarily poor.
* **C: Compared to nearby cities, it has less African influence:** The passage states it has *more* Arabic influence than other African cities, not less African influence.
* **D: The city is no longer a tourist attraction:** The passage states ""agbanyeghị n'ugwu ya na-eme ya otu ndọta ndị nleta"" which means ""despite its dangers, it remains a draw for visitors."" This directly contradicts option D.

"Na mbụ, olee mgbe e zubere asọmpi Olympic nke oge okpomọkụ? ","The correct answer is **D: Julaị 2020**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""when the Olympics were postponed in July 2020"". This directly answers the question of when the Olympics were originally scheduled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2021 Ọgọọst** - This is when the *Paralympics* took place, not the Olympics.
*   **B: Maachị 2020** - This is when many entry restrictions were still in place.
*   **C: 2021 Septemba** - This is the end date of the Paralympics, not the original Olympic schedule.

"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ oge ọwa nwere ike ị bụ tọnadò?","The correct answer is **D: Mgbe o rutere ala**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tornadoes ""become ‘tornadoes’ when they touch the ground.""  Options A, B, and C describe characteristics of the *formation* of a tornado, but it's the contact with the ground that officially *makes* it a tornado.
"
Kedụ otu n’ime ndị a bụ ihe njirimara eji mara tonado?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha na-emepụta ikuku okirikiri ihe ruru 100-200 ga kwa awa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ha na ebupute oke ikuku (ọtụtụ mgbe maịlụ 100-200 kwa awa)..."" (They produce strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour)...) This directly links high-speed winds to tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha na-agagharịkarị n’iji ibu n’anyì ezigbo arụ** - The passage doesn't mention tornadoes having a specific direction of travel or being related to heavy burdens.
* **C: Ha na-agbanwe bụrụ awa mgbe o metụrụ n’ala** - The passage states they *become* ""ụmụ ajọọ oké ifufe"" (tornadoes) when they touch the ground, not that they change *into* hours.
* **D: Ha na-agbanwe ọgbaraogo nke na-akwa akwapụ ikuku akwapụ** - The passage mentions low pressure, but doesn't describe a changing pattern of turbulent air.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ị nwere ike ịjụta ndụmọdụ nke ndị ọchịchị karịa nke gị..."" This directly indicates that travelers can seek advice from the authorities *of the country they are visiting*. The passage also cautions that this advice is tailored to their own citizens, but it still originates from those authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Site n’aka ihe ahụrụ egosipụtara n’ime ndụmọdụ njem ahụ:** The passage suggests travel advisories are *affected* by local conditions, but doesn't say that's where the advice *comes from*.
*   **C: Site n’aka ụmụafọ nke obodo ahụ ha ga-aga hụ:** The passage doesn’t mention locals providing guidance on political situations.
*   **D: Site n’aka gọọmenti nke aka ha:** The passage contrasts seeking advice from the host country’s authorities *over* one’s own government, implying the advice isn't coming from the traveler's home government.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel advisories are ""only a brief compilation of political conditions in a country"" and that the advice given is ""superficial, with significant generalizations."" This directly supports the idea that advisories offer a simplified overview of the political situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Metụtara nkagbu inshọransi** - While the passage mentions insurance *can* be affected, it's not the primary thing travelers will encounter *in* the advisories themselves.
*   **C: Metụtara inshọransi ahụike** - Same reasoning as A.  The advisories might influence insurance choices, but aren't about health insurance specifically.
*   **D: Ozi akọwara gbasara ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ nke obodo ahụ** - The passage explicitly says the information is *not* detailed (""superficial,"" ""generalizations"").

Here's why:

The passage states a travel agent was traditionally a good choice for travel *beyond the previous experience* of the traveler, to places with different cultures, languages, or countries, and lower financial risk. This directly points to someone needing help with their *first* time travelling internationally or to unfamiliar places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't specifically mention corporate travel.
*   **B:** While a travel agent *could* help with a budget vacation, the passage emphasizes navigating unfamiliarity, not just cost.
*   **C:** The passage states a travel agent is helpful for places with different languages, implying they help *with* the language barrier, not that the trip *is* the language barrier itself.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ọnọdụ nke onye njem ga-enweta ihenrite site n’enyemaka nke ojeozi njem?","The correct answer is **B: Mgbe onye njem na-enwe mmasị ime bukin pụrụiche nke ezumiike n’oge mbụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents were originally a good choice for travel that went ""beyond the previous experience of the traveler, customs, language or nation with little spending power.""  It then goes on to say that it might be better to use a travel agent who can tailor your travel opportunities to be *like yours* - meaning personalized and possibly luxurious. This points to needing help with specialized bookings or first-time experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't specifically mention booking flights to one's homeland.
* **C:** Language ability isn't the focus of needing a travel agent.
* **D:**  While the passage touches on culture, it doesn't say a travel agent is best when finding places *similar* to your own culture. It's about going *beyond* your experience.

Here's why:

*   **The passage emphasizes that things will be different in a new place.** It mentions differences in customs, laws, food, language, etc.  Therefore, expecting things to be the same as ""home"" (as option C suggests) would lead to problems.
*   **The passage aims to *prevent* frustration and discomfort.**  The best way to do that is by anticipating differences and being prepared to adapt.  Expecting things to be different (A) is a form of preparation.
*   **Option B** While trying new foods can be part of the experience, it doesn't directly address preventing hardship or confusion.
*   **Option D** While being open minded can be useful, it doesn't prevent difficulties arising from misunderstanding different rules or customs.



The passage explicitly states that to avoid frustration, you need to understand that things *will* be done differently."
"Dịka ozi dị na paseeji kwuru, kedụ ụdịrị onye nwere ike inata ọdachị ahụmiihe mgbe ọ na-aga mba ofesi?","The correct answer is **D: Onye nke nwere mmasị na mmụta (Someone who is interested in learning)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding differences in customs, laws, food, language, and norms when traveling abroad.  Someone who is interested in learning would be more likely to research these things *before* traveling, reducing the chances of being caught off guard or feeling uncomfortable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onye nke nwere mmasị n’ezigbo nri (Someone who is interested in good food):** While enjoying food is part of travel, the passage is about broader cultural understanding.
* **B: Onye nke nwere mgbalị n’ịgbanwe (Someone who is willing to change):**  Willingness to adapt is *a result* of learning, but not the primary characteristic described as preventative in the passage.
* **C: Onye nke nwere mmasị keonwe ya (Someone who is interested in having fun):** Fun is a goal of travel, but the passage focuses on *preparation* to ensure the trip goes smoothly.

The passage specifically states: ""Ọ bụrụ na ị ga-ama ụlọikwuu n’ezi, weta ihe ndina mara ụlọikwuu ma ọ bụ hammock iji gbochiri gị agwọ, akpị na ndị dị otú ahụ."" This translates to ""If you are going to sleep on the ground, bring a sleeping pad or hammock to protect you from bugs, thorns, and the like.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nweta iji mata fauna otuebe túpụ ihie ụra n’ala ahụ** - While knowing the wildlife is good advice generally, the passage doesn't specifically mention this as a preparation for *sleeping*.
*   **B: Kwụsị imefu ego na nri n’oge mbụ gị** - The passage mentions enjoying good food but doesn't warn against spending money on it.
*   **D: Tinye n’ụlọ nkwarị dị mma n’oge mbụ ịlọrutere** - The passage suggests staying in comfortable accommodations (""ezigbo ulo ezumike"") *to help settle in* but doesn't focus on finding good lodging as a preventative measure.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns against sleeping directly on mattresses or floors in unfamiliar places due to the risk of bedbugs, insects, etc. It recommends bringing your own bedding (sheet or hammock) to avoid this. This directly relates to a potential expense or discomfort during city exploration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ǹkà-nri Keọdịda:** The passage doesn't mention any food costs or card issues.
*   **B: Ụmụ ọrụ dị mma:** The passage encourages being a polite guest and finding good guides, but doesn't link this to a cost that could be considered wasteful.
*   **D: Ụmụ ụlọ nkwarị dị mma:** While finding good accommodations is mentioned, the issue isn't the cost of the accommodations themselves, but the potential issues *within* the accommodations (bedbugs) which could lead to additional costs or discomfort.

This translates to: ""If the trip involves a laptop or tablet, save a copy inside it or on a disk (accessible even without the internet).""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nye onye gị na ya so eme njem kọpị** (Give a copy to your travel companion) - While a good backup, it doesn't fulfill the requirement of having a readily accessible, independent copy *if* internet access is unavailable.  It relies on someone else.
* **B: Na ezipụrụ onwe ha kọpị ozi-e** (Email a copy to yourself) - This requires internet access, which the scenario explicitly says might not be available.
* **D: Na-eme nchekwa kọpị n’ “urukpu”** (Make a backup in ""the cloud"") - This *also* requires internet access, making it unsuitable.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the documents should include:

*   The insurer's email address.
*   A phone number showing the country code for advice and support.
*   A copy saved offline (on a USB drive or disk).
*   Sharing a copy with trusted contacts.

The passage **does not** mention needing a foreign emergency contact number. Options B, C, and D are all directly related to information outlined in the text. Therefore, A is the only option that isn't required by the instructions."

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 mm nke adịghị mma**.

The passage identifies 36 x 24 mm as the *most popular* film size, and the question asks for the ""common"" or frequently used format."
Kedụ ụdị nke nhakọ ihengosi na-enye ngosipụta nke dịka nke yiri DSLR?,"The correct answer is **C: 56 x 56 mm ihengosi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that some medium format cameras have a 6cm x 6cm size, which equates to a negative of 56mm x 56mm. It also explicitly states this provides a display area *similar to* a DSLR. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 35 mm ihengosi** - The passage contrasts this as being smaller.
*   **B: Nhatanha-nhazi ihengosi** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: 6 x 6 cm ihengosi** - While mentioned, the passage clarifies this is equivalent to the 56x56mm negative size which is what gives the DSLR-like display.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the easiest way to start a travel writing business is to *learn from travel websites* and then, *once you understand how things are changed and arranged online as a searcher*, you can go on to create your own website.  Learning web design is the direct action that allows you to understand how websites are built and function – essentially, learning from existing travel websites.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: Dee ọtụtụ ederede maka blọọg njem dị mma** (Write a lot of articles for good travel blogs): While helpful for practice, the passage doesn’t mention *writing for others* as the initial step.
*   **C: Wube weebụsaịtị nke gị onwe gị** (Build your own website): The passage says to build your own website *after* learning from others, not as the first step.
*   **D: Mụchaa ụmụ ǹkà ndezi gị** (Polish your editing skills): Editing is important for *any* writing, but the passage focuses specifically on understanding the online structure.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that after learning from existing travel websites and understanding how things are done online, the next step is to *create your own website*.  Therefore, website development is the logical next skill to focus on after understanding the landscape.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ime blọg** (Blogging) - While blogging is *part* of a travel website, it's not the foundational step of *building* the website itself.
* **B: Na-eme nhakọ weebụ** (Web Design) -  Design is important, but development (the actual building of the site's functionality) comes first. You need a structure before you can design it.
* **C: Ziri ezi** (Proofreading) - Proofreading is a skill used *within* content creation, not a preparatory step for starting a travel writing business.

Kedụ ụdịrị ọnọdụ ihuigwe a na-achọpụtakarị ọrịa eriri afọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekpomọọkụ ihuigwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N’ebe enwere okpomoku ihuigwe nje n’etoo osiso ma kwa n’ebite aka mgbe onoghi n’ahu mmadu.""  This directly translates to ""In places with hot climates, germs spread quickly and easily when people eat."" This links hot climates to the spread of gastrointestinal illnesses (like Delhi Belly, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oyi ihuigwe ga:** The passage mentions breathing problems in cold climates, not necessarily stomach issues.
*   **B: Oke oyi ihuigwe ga:** Same as above.
*   **D: Ọkọchị ihuigwe:** While summers can be hot, ""ekpomọọkụ ihuigwe"" (hot climate) is a broader and more accurate description of the areas where these illnesses are prevalent, as it includes tropical regions as well."
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, ịgbananwụ o nwere ike nchekwa ahụ na gịnị?","The correct answer is **A: Ụmụ nsogbu eriri afọ** (Stomach problems).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on digestive issues:** The text extensively details various illnesses caused by bacteria and different climates affecting the digestive system – ""Delhi Belly, Abụmọọnụ nke Fero, Mmegwara nke Montezuma,"" and general stomach problems.  It also mentions issues like diarrhea in hot climates.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Geemụ otuebe (Germs)** – While germs *cause* the problems, the passage discusses the problems themselves, not just the cause.
    * **C: Ụmụ nsogbu nku ume (Breathing problems)** – Breathing problems are mentioned briefly in relation to cold climates, but the main focus is on digestive issues.
    * **D: Delhi Belli (Delhi Belly)** – Delhi Belly is *an example* of a stomach problem, but the passage is discussing a broader range of such issues.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""site n’inwe otu visa Schengen, ị kwesịghịzi itinye akwụkwọ maka visa otu n’ime mba ndịòtù Schengen nke ọ bụla iche..."" This directly supports the benefit of avoiding multiple visa applications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emefu obere** (Spend less) - While saving time and paperwork *could* lead to spending less, the passage doesn't directly state it.
* **C: Gbanahụ nnyocha njikwa ọtụtụ paaspọtụ** (Avoid multiple passport controls) - The passage *does* mention avoiding passport checks at borders, but the main benefit highlighted is the visa simplification.  Avoiding multiple passport controls is a *result* of the Schengen area, not the primary advantage.
* **D: O nweghị paaspọtụ a chọrọ** (No passport required) - The passage states you avoid *checks*, not that you don't need a passport at all. You still need a passport for entry into the Schengen area initially.

Ihe nke agaghị inwe ike ịchọta n’ala ili nke Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụfọdụ ihe ichọ mma**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""O nweghi ihe mmadụ na-aga ịhụ n'ili Tutankhamun; o pere mpe karịa ma nwekwaa obere ịchọ mma karịa.""  This translates to ""There are no people going to see Tutankhamun's tomb; it is smaller and has less ornamentation than others.""

Therefore, you *wouldn't* expect to find elaborate decorations in Tutankhamun's tomb compared to others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isi mummi:** The passage mentions damage to the mummy's head during removal, implying the head *was* there.
*   **C: Ngù mummi ga:** The passage indicates the mummy was inside a coffin, so the wrappings would be present.
*   **D: Ụba gasị:** While many treasures are now in the Cairo Museum, the text doesn't say they were *never* there; it says they were *removed*. They were originally in the tomb.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ ebemwega Vancouver nke ga-adị mma n’ọnụahịa maka ndị njem? ","The correct answer is **A: Agwaetiti Granville**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...it is easily accessible by water taxi from Granville Island in Vancouver."" This directly indicates Granville Island is a way to *reach* Bowen Island from Vancouver and is implied as a convenient starting point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oshimiri ahụ ruo na akụkụ Ihuigwe:** The passage does not mention this location.
*   **C: Agwaetiti Bowen:** This is the *destination*, not a departure point *from* Vancouver.
*   **D: Whistler:** While mentioned, Whistler is described as expensive (""off-peak"") and is a separate destination in itself (1.5 hours from Vancouver). It's not presented as a budget-friendly option for getting *to* Bowen Island.



"
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ebemwega nke nwere ike inye ndị njem ezigbo ahụmiihe pụrụiche na Vancouver?","The correct answer is **B: Whistler**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ofu-opi (awa 1.5 ikwa-ugbo site na Vancouver) di oke-onu mana ama ya ama n’ihi asoroma-mpi olimpic nke Winta 2010. N’oge oyi, nụrị ụtọ ụfọdụ egwuregwu skii kacha mma n’Ugwu Amerịka, ma n’ime oge ọkọchị nwaa ụfọdụ ezigbo ịgba ígwè n’ugwu.""  This clearly describes Whistler as offering unique experiences (skiing and mountain biking) and is linked to Vancouver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agwaetiti Bowen:** While mentioned, the passage describes it as a day or weekend trip with standard activities, not *special* experiences.
* **C: Ime obodo Vancouver:** The passage doesn't focus on unique experiences *within* Vancouver itself.
* **D: Agwaetiti Granville:** The passage mentions it only as a point of access to Bowen Island, not as a destination with special experiences.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Ekwela nkwa na ị ga-enwe mmiri ma ọ bụrụ na ị gafee àkwà mmiri ma ọ bụ na-aga n'okporo ụzọ ndị na-aga n'okporo ụzọ Mmepe."" This means during the rainy season (November to March) visibility is *reduced* due to the spray.
* The passage also implies the best viewing is when the spray isn't overwhelming. Therefore, going *outside* of the rainy season would give the best chance of clear views.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nọvembà site na Marchị:** This is the rainy season, which the passage says can obstruct views.
* **B: N’oge nlele ndị mbịambịa:** The passage doesn't mention specific tourist seasons.
* **C: Mgbe ọgba mmiri dị elu:** High water levels contribute to the heavy spray that blocks the view.

"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ihe bụ ọdachi ịga na Mmiri okwute Victoria Falls n’etiti Nọvembà na Marchị?","The correct answer is **A: Nlele nke enweghị mgbochi nke Ọdịda mmiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N’oge udu mmiri (Nọvemba ruo Maachị), ibu mmiri ahụ ga-akarịkwu ma Ozizo mmiri ga-esikwa ike. Ekwela nkwa na ị ga-enwe mmiri ma ọ bụrụ na ị gafee àkwà mmiri ma ọ bụ na-aga n'okporo ụzọ ndị na-aga n'okporo ụzọ Mmepe.

This clearly explains that during the rainy season (November to March), the high spray from the falls can completely obscure the view of the falls themselves.  The ""disadvantage"" is losing the unobstructed view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nwa-obere ndị nleta njem:** The passage doesn't mention a decrease in tourism.
*   **C: Ka Ọdịda mmiri ahụ si eme:** The passage doesn't mention an impact on the waterfall itself.
*   **D: Gbanahụ oge ùdùmmiri:** This would *avoid* the disadvantage, not be the disadvantage itself.

"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ nke n’ime ndị a nke akwadoghị mgbe eji drone eme ihengosi?","The correct answer is **D: Na-eme ihengosi naanị n’ebe ndị mmadụ jupụtara ebe nke agaghị enwe ike ịchọpụta drone.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ife ngwa dron fefee ọdụ ụgbọelu maọbụ igwe mmadụ na-abụkarị ihe ọjọọ..."" (Flying a drone near airports or people is usually bad...) This means operating a drone in crowded areas where it can't be easily seen is discouraged and likely against the rules.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the passage:

*   **A: Na-atule n’ọdịniihu maka nnata ikikere iji mee ihengosi** (Applying for permission to operate) - The passage states you need permission (ikikere) to operate a drone.
*   **B: Na-enweta ikikere ndịọzọ** (Getting other permissions) - The passage mentions needing ""ikikere maọbụ ikikere ọzọ"" (permission or another permission), supporting this option.
*   **C: Na-achọgharị ikikere** (Seeking permission) - This is similar to A and B and is a necessary step.

Therefore, option D is the only one that describes an action specifically discouraged in the passage."
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ebe ndị kachasị mma ime ihengosi site n’iji dromụ?","The correct answer is **D: N'ebe ndị i burula ụzọ nata ikike maka ya** (In places where you have already obtained permission).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọ bụrụ na iji drone arụ ọrụ, tulee n’oge dịka ihe e nyere gị ikikere iseta maọbụ ikikere maọbụ ikikere ọzọ gasị achọrọ."" This translates to ""If you operate a drone, comply with the time as stipulated in the permit given to you or the authorization or other required permit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nọketere ndị mmadụ nso agaghị abụ nsogbu maka ahụrụ dromụ** (Being close to people won't be a problem for the drone) - The passage implies the opposite; flying near people could be problematic.
*   **B: N’ebe nke ana-anabataghị ikike isè fòto** (In places where permission to take photos is not accepted) - This is the opposite of what the passage advises.
*   **C: N’ebe ndị mmadụ jupụtara ebe nke agaghị enwecha ike ịhụ dromụ** (In crowded places where the drone won't be easily seen) - Flying in crowded areas is generally discouraged and potentially dangerous.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that registration requirements **vary by country**. It explicitly says ""In some cities, only those staying in hotels are required to register,"" and emphasizes needing to **find out beforehand** because the rules can be confusing. This contradicts the statement that *all* countries require registration with their embassies.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Ọ bụrụ na ị nọ n’ụlọ e nyere onye mbịambịa njem, ị gaghị eme ndebanye aha** - The passage states ""In other situations, only those staying outside of hotel accommodations are required to register.""
*   **C: gịga i gara na ndị na-ahụ maka ọpụpụ na mbata mmadụ n’obodo ka a ga-achọ** - The passage mentions visiting the immigration office as a method of registration.
*   **D: N’ụfọdụ ebe gasị, ụlọnkwarị otuebe nwere ike ijikwa ndebanyeaha ahụ** - The passage states ""In many cities with such laws, local hotels will take care of registration."""
Kedụ nke n’ime ndị a abụghị ebe ndị mbịambịa njem nwere ike ịga jikwaa ndebanye aha ha?,"The correct answer is **C: Poostụ ọfịịsị otuebe** (Post office).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that registration can be done at:

*   **Ọdụ ndị uwe ojii otuebe** (Local police stations)
*   **Ụlọ nkwarị ebe ha bi** (Hotels/Accommodation around the area - they often handle it)
*   **Ọfịịsị imigreshọn gasị** (Immigration office)

The passage does *not* mention post offices as a place for visa registration.

Therefore, the post office is the one place from the list where visitors would *not* typically go to register their presence."

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that volunteering (or working for free) during travel is about experiences *not* earning money. It even mentions many volunteer positions provide room and board, but rarely pay a salary. Someone looking for a large salary would *not* benefit from this type of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Onye na-enwe olileanya iji nweta ndị enyi ọhụrụ n’ofesi (Someone hoping to make new friends at work):** The passage mentions meeting new people as a benefit.
*   **C: Onye na-enwe olileanya inweta ǹkà ọhụrụ (Someone hoping to gain new skills):** The passage explicitly states volunteering can help you gain new skills.
*   **D: Onye nwere ike inwe mmasị ụlọ na bọọdụ (Someone who might appreciate room and board):** The passage says many volunteer positions provide this, so they *would* benefit.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...otụtuụ ọrụ akwụghị ụgwọ na-enye ọnụụlọ na ụgbọ..."" (many unpaid jobs offer accommodation and food...). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ụgwọ ọnwa ka a na-enye kwa mgbe** (A monthly salary is always given) - The passage says *some* jobs pay a small monthly salary, but doesn’t say it’s *always* given.
* **B: Ọ na-eduba n’ohere nnweta ọrụ** (It provides job opportunities) - The passage focuses on volunteer work, not finding paid employment.
* **D: O ga-enyere gị aka inweta uche amamiihe** (It helps you gain insight) - While the passage mentions gaining understanding, the question asks specifically about *financial* benefits.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states a ""typical"" trip includes ""spending about a week on-site at Disney."" This means spending about a week at the parks themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nọ na saịtị ụlọnkwarị nọpụrụ anọpụ** - The passage does not specify how long one needs to stay on site to have a 'typical' Disney World trip.
*   **C: Nọrọ njem niile ahụ n’akụrụngwa Disney** - The passage only discusses spending time *at* Disney, not necessarily staying *in* Disney-owned accommodations for the whole trip.
*   **D: Bara bọọsụ site n’ọdụ ụgbọelu ruo na ụlọnkwarị** - While taking Disney's transportation is mentioned, it is not the defining characteristic of a typical trip."

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Disney anaghi ekwe: i gaghi enye onye ozo tiketi gi.**"" (Disney does not allow: you should not give your ticket to another person.) This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: E nwere mbanye on-saịtị dị adị** - The passage mentions staying ""on-site"" at Disney for about a week.
*   **C: E nwere bọsịsị dị adị ga-ebu ndị mmadụ site n’ọdụ ụgbọelu gaa n’akụrụngwa** - The passage describes taking buses ""from Orlando International Airport to Disney resorts"".
*   **D: Tiketi ọtụtụ-ụbọchị bụ nke ana-ahụkarị na weebụsaịtị orire nrefù ga** - The passage notes that tickets are often resold on sites like eBay or Craigslist.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the training would cover ""mmepụta omume"" (behavior production/role-playing), ""mgbata ọsọ enyemaka mbụ"" (first aid drills), and ""ọzụzụ maka ngwaagha"" (weapon training).  This directly relates to preparing someone for actions and behaviors in a conflict zone.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mgbanahụ ọzara (Jungle survival):** While magazines cover jungle survival, the passage says publications on battle locations are fewer. The focus isn't on jungle survival *within* the training.
*   **B: Nkwado enyemaka mbụ nke ọgwụgwọ (Medical first aid support):**  First aid *drills* are mentioned, but the passage doesn’t emphasize comprehensive medical training.
*   **C: Nkwado mpaghara agha (Battlefield support):**  This is too broad. The passage details *training* for conflict, not specifically providing support *during* a battle.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ isiokwu ga nke i nwere ike imecha na klassi ọzụzụ ọkachamara?","The correct answer is **A: Ọgwụgwọ mbụ** (First aid).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ọtụtụ mgbata ọsọ enyemaka mbụ"" (several first aid scenarios) as part of the training.  While the passage touches on combat environments, it emphasizes the practical skills taught, and first aid is directly listed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mpaghara agha ga** (Going to battlefields) - The passage mentions limited reporting on areas of conflict, but doesn't say this is a topic of instruction.
*   **C: Mgbanahụ ọzara** (Jungle survival) - The passage mentions magazines about jungle survival, but this is presented as something *outside* of the specialized training.
*   **D: Ogige siri ike** (Difficult terrain) - While related to combat environments, the passage doesn't specifically mention training on navigating difficult terrain.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...if you are concerned, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company."" This directly recommends purchasing bottled water as a way to ensure safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sie mmiri n’ọkụ ọtụtụ nkeji** - While boiling is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically say *how long* to boil it, and doesn't present it as the *best* option for peace of mind.
* **C: Sie mmiri n’ọkụ otu nkeji** - The passage states that one minute may be sufficient *in some cases*, implying it's not always enough.
* **D: Nyochaa mmiri ahụ maka ụmụ nje ama** - The passage doesn't mention testing the water.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the danger of rip currents is *even greater* for strong swimmers, because trying to swim against the current is exhausting and often futile. This means that even skilled swimmers can become overwhelmed in the strong, fast-moving water of a rip current.  ""Mmiri na-ebu ebu"" (turbulent water) best captures this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Igwu mmiri dịka ndị na-arụ ọrụ n’oshiiri** - This doesn't relate to the specific dangers described.
*   **B: Igwu mmiri na mmiri dị oke omimi** - While deep water can be dangerous, the passage focuses on the *current* itself, not just the depth.
*   **D: Igwu mmiri na mmiri nwere ikuku** -  Air bubbles aren't the primary hazard mentioned.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that once you're out of the rip current, swimming back to shore is *easier* than usual. This implies trying to swim *parallel* to the shore (changing your direction) and then back to land is the best course of action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gwusie mmiri ike megide obubu mmiri:** This is exactly what the passage warns *against*. Fighting the current tires you out and is often impossible.
*   **C: Gwuo mmiri n’ụzọ ọzọ:** This is too vague and doesn’t offer a specific strategy to escape.
*   **D: Gwuo n’omimi mmiri:** The passage states the rip current is caused by water returning to deeper areas, so swimming deeper wouldn't help.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ịme njem ụgbọ mmiri gaa obodo ndị na-adọrọ mmasị n’ime Danube ahụ"" (taking a boat trip to attractive towns along the Danube).  This directly relates to visiting towns *on* a waterway for a vacation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọzọ n’Ọwa Erie ahụ** - While the passage mentions the Erie Canal, it doesn't specifically suggest visiting *towns* along it as a good vacation idea.
* **C: Na Ndagwurugwu Rhine** - The passage mentions the Rhine Valley, but focuses on visiting ""ụmụ nnukwu ụlọ"" (castles), not towns.
* **D: Nọketere ụzọmmiri ọbụla obodo** - This is too broad. The passage highlights *specific* waterways.

This directly advises women to be aware of cultural differences to avoid misunderstandings and potentially offensive behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zere mkparịtaụka ọnọdụ alụmdi:** While the passage mentions women being presumed married, it doesn't advise avoiding the topic altogether.
* **C: Zere iyi ọla na-emuke emuke:** The passage only mentions avoiding *expensive* jewelry, not all jewelry.

This directly supports understanding cultural differences and how they can lead to misinterpretations of advances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mata na ọdịchaghị mfe iso mmadụ:** While true in general, this isn't specifically addressed in the passage.
* **B: Yiri ọla aka buru ibù iji gosipụta ọnọdụ alụmdi:** The passage says to avoid overly expensive jewelry, not to wear a ring to *indicate* marital status.
* **D: N’ọnọdụ eleghara anya na nrata niile ị na-enweta, kwụrụ chim n’ịjụ ụmụnwoke:** The passage encourages being assertive (""Guzosie ike n'ịsị ụmụnwoke mba, ma atụla egwu ịkwechiri"") but doesn't advocate simply dismissing all advances. It emphasizes understanding cultural context first.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""ụfọdụ ogige anụmanụ nwere iwu maka ise ha foto a ga-etinye n'ihe ọbụla a ga-ere ere."" This directly indicates that specific conditions (rules set by the park) can influence how a wildlife photographer operates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The paragraph mentions small creatures needing different apertures, but doesn't say this *causes* a special aperture requirement.
*   **B:** While selling photos might be a goal, the paragraph doesn’t say it forces a specific technical approach.
*   **C:** Shy animals might be challenging, but don't dictate a change in aperture.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that wildlife photography requires patience, skill, and good equipment.** It also mentions animals can be shy or aggressive and the environment can be harsh. These all represent *challenges*.
* **Option B, ""ejizi ihe ike e kere eke"" (being created by artificial difficulty)** doesn't fit within the described challenges. The difficulties are natural – the behavior of the animals, the weather, the need for specialized equipment, and finding rare animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ịchọpụta anụmanụ pụrụ iche (finding rare animals):** The passage says it can be difficult to find specific animals.
* **C: Ịzụta ụdị anya m dị mkpa (buying the type of lenses I need):** The passage states wildlife photography *requires* good equipment, including long telephoto lenses.
* **D: na-arụ ọrụ n'ọnọdụ ndị na-adịghị mma (working in harsh conditions):** The passage mentions that the environment can be cold, hot, or bad.

* **The passage states:** ""N'okporo ụzọ ebe ais na sno dị, nrapara dị ala nakwa ịnweghị ike ịnya moto n'elu ya dịka ị nọ na asfalt nkịtị.""  This means traction is reduced on icy or snowy roads. Roads that are grooved/textured provide *better* traction, even in adverse conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: obere nguzogide (low resistance):** Low resistance doesn't help with grip on ice or snow.
* **C: Oke ụmụ irighiri mmiri (heavy rain):** The passage specifically mentions rain *can* cause issues (freezing, reduced visibility).
* **D: Mgbochi mgbaraihe (blockages):** While blockages are mentioned as a possible hazard, they don't directly address the primary problem of driving on icy or snowy surfaces.



"
Kedu akụkụ nke ụtụ isi ego nwere ike ịbụ otu na mba niile?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even with varying tax structures, ""ana anako utu isi ego ma na goomenti etiti na kwa na mpaghara ya"". This means income tax exists at both the federal/central *and* regional levels. The passage then specifically mentions the *rate* (otu ndị na-akwụ ya) will vary, implying that the *base* – the thing being taxed (income/wage) – is consistent across regions. Therefore, the aspect most likely to be the same nationwide is the **wage** or **income** itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nrụpụta ihe owuwu (Construction)** - Construction projects and taxes related to them are highly localized.
*   **C: nke ị na-etinye (Investment)** - Investment taxes vary widely.
*   **D: Nkata (Notes)** - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the core discussion of tax structures.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...if you work in a foreign country, it means you will have to pay taxes in that jurisdiction."" This directly implies that your tax obligations are tied to the country where you are *working*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ebe ọ bụla ị na-ebikarị** - The passage focuses on where you *work*, not just where you reside.
*   **B: N'ime United States** - The passage uses the US as an example of a country with federal and regional taxes, but doesn't suggest all foreign income must be reported there.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the World Expo is a ""large-scale event...of all countries in the world."" This implies participation from many, if not all, countries is a core characteristic. Option D directly contradicts this.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Ngosipụta nwere ike igosi akụkọ ma ọ bụ omenala obodo** - The text says Expos ""show what is happening in the world or the culture of countries and historical events.""
*   **B: N'akụkụ ngosi nka na ihe ọmụma, ihe ngosi botanical na-egosipụta** - The text specifically mentions ""World Horticultural Exhibitions"" featuring flowers, orchards, and trees.
*   **C: Ihe nwere ike ịga n'ihu ruo ọnwa isii** - The text states events ""typically last anywhere from three to six months.""

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a chọrọ maka ngosi ngosi mba ụwa ma ọ bụ ngosi ngosi ụwa?,"The correct answer is **A: A ghaghị iwepụta akụkọ ihe mere eme nke mba, yana ihe ịma aka zuru ụwa ọnụ ugbu a**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that World Expos ""gosipụta ihe na-eme n'ụwa maọbụ omenala obodo na akụkọ ihe mere eme"" - which means they *must* feature a country's history and current global issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Enweghị ike ịme mmemme ahụ kwa afọ n'otu mba ahụ** - The text says they *can* be held annually in different countries, but doesn't say they *cannot* be held in the same country. It notes they often don't, but it's not a requirement.
*   **C: Ihe omume nwere ike ịdịru karịa ọnwa isii** - The text states they usually last between three and six months, not *more* than six.
*   **D: Mba niile ga-esonyerịrị maka ngosi a ga-anabata ya** - The text doesn’t state that *all* countries must participate for a World Expo to be held. It says countries ""na-esonye"" (participate), but not that it's mandatory for all.

Kedu n'ime omume ndị a ga-eme ka mwakpo anụmanụ ghara ịdị obere?,"The correct answer is **C: na-edebe anụ ọhịa wolf ma ọ dịkarịa ala 25 yad** (Maintaining a distance of at least 25 yards from wildlife).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: *""nọtee aka opekata mpe yadị maọbụ mita 100 n'ebe anụ ọhịa bea na wulfu nọ na yadị maọbụ mita 25 n'ebe anụ ọhịa ndị ọzọ niile nọ!""*  This translates to *""keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards away from all other wildlife!""*  Following this instruction directly reduces the chance of an attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: na-ebute osisi na-esi ísì ụtọ** (Bringing fragrant foods) - The text states to *avoid* bringing fragrant foods.
*   **B: Na-ebupụ ihe mkpofu n'ogige** (Littering in the park) - The text says to keep campsites clean, implying littering is bad and could attract animals.
*   **D: Iri nri a na-eji egbochi anụmanụ** (Eating food that attracts animals) - The text states to avoid bringing/consuming foods that might attract animals.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ekwughị na paragraf dị ka ihe nwere ike ime ka ụmụ anụmanụ na-awakpo ụmụ mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **A: ike isi**.

Here's why:

*   **The paragraph explicitly states:**
    *   **B: Ọdịda idobe anya dị mma** - ""Afọ ọ bụla, a na-emerụ ọtụtụ ndị nleta ahụ n'ihi na ha enyeghị ezigbo ohere."" (People are hurt yearly because they don't give enough space.)
    *   **C: na-enye anụ ọhịa nri** - ""ma e kwesịghị inye ha nri"" (you should not feed them).
    *   **D: anụmanụ ndị na-amabughị ndị mmadụ nso** - The entire passage emphasizes that animals are wild and should be given space, implying they are not accustomed to close human contact.

*   **The paragraph does *not* mention:**
    *   **A: ike isi** - The passage doesn't state that anger or temperament is a cause for attacks. It focuses on proximity and lack of respect for their space.

Therefore, **ike isi** is the factor *not* mentioned as a potential cause of animal attacks in the provided text."
