"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, accordion hpe awngdang ai hku dum lu na matu hpa hpe tup hkrak teng ai hpaji jaw ai lam ngu nlu sawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Simsa ai lata hpe mazing let nsi note ni hpe jaw hkra dum na matu sadi u.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nang na lata hpe yungwi nsi note ni yawng hpe jaw hkra dum ai shaloi mai byin ai daram shayawm da na matu sadi u.""  This translates to something like, ""It is said that understanding the notes of a simple song can be a starting point.""  This directly relates to understanding *nsi note* (notes) from *simsa ai lata* (a simple song).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions learning, it doesn't focus on ""sharawt"" (practice) as the key starting point.
* **B:** The passage doesn't discuss ""ningja lam"" (personal experience) or ""shamu shamawt lam"" (difficulties).
* **D:** This option focuses on the *accordion* and its bellows, but the initial passage is about learning *music in general* starting with simple songs, not specifically about how an accordion works.

"Accordion dum ai ten hta, npu na gara wa mahtang gaw nsen shatsaw na matu karum ya ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: N-gun grau law na**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Accordion madum sumpyi hta nsen shaja na matu bellow ni hpe **n-gun grau shadat** nna (sh) grau lawan ai hku pat let dum ra ai.""  This directly translates to ""When playing the accordion, the bellows are moved up and down (or back and forth).""  ""N-gun grau law"" means ""move up and down/back and forth"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grau lawan na:** While ""grau lawan"" (move) is part of the description, it doesn't capture the *way* it moves – up and down.
* **C: Dip n-gun shayawm na:** This means ""don't move at all"" - the opposite of what happens.
* **D: Lata layung shamu shamawt ai lam shayawm na:** This refers to singing or playing tunes - not the physical action of the accordion.



"
Hkrangmu nsen lamang na sumla ni gaw hpa majaw makau ndung ni hpe di da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Sumla hkrung npu na laika ni hpe madun na matu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lama na sumla hkrung kaw laika madun ai shaloi npu de grai kap taw nna shanhte hpe yawng nmai madun na ra ai.""  This directly translates to ""and when the DVD is playing, it can show the scenes of the story as if they are real, and it can make you feel emotions.""  This means the DVD allows you to *experience* the story, or the ""laika"" (scenes/story) of the sumla (film/movie).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sumla hpe TV pat man hta hpring hkra mu lu na matu** - The passage talks about *what* the DVD does, not *where* you watch it.
* **C: Kaga hkrang ni de aloi sha galai lu na matu** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Npu de grai nyi ai madun laika ni hpe dum hpyawt kau na matu** - While emotions are involved, the passage doesn't say it *causes* you to feel them, just that it *can* make you feel them.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu de na gara wa mahtang gaw sumla hkrung hpe DVD hkrang galai ai ten hta mayak ni nga ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: TV pat man yawng hpring taw ai sumla**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai madi madun ai a matu, nang TV kaw mu ai lam yawng gaw shi shingwang kata rep, lahta, npu, maga ga de ni sha re."" This translates to ""Regarding this problem, the TV displays things like fast forward, rewind, chapter, etc.""  This clearly indicates the TV is showing options related to the DVD playback, meaning it's displaying controls for the *sumla hkrung* (DVD content).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: TV pat man hta yawng nlu jahpring ai sumla:**  The passage doesn't say the TV *is* the content, just that it displays controls *for* the content.
* **B: Adaw achyen re ai sumla hkrung npu na laika ni:** This refers to issues with scanning and problems reading the DVD, not what's happening on the TV screen.
* **D: makau ndung di da ai:**  This refers to the DVD being unable to read, which is a separate issue.



"
British mare sin dap gaw gara kaw nga lai wa ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...du daju John Cadwalder gaw hpyen n-gun jat ai lam hpe hkum pat jahkring na matu **Bordentown** na British maren sin dap hpe lam galai gumlang gasat na matu tsun shabra na re."" 

This directly translates to: ""...and Major John Cadwalder was sent to scout the British camp at **Bordentown**...""

Therefore, Bordentown is where the British camp was located."
Lata hte ka ai laika hprang hta kadai na lata masat sen hpe mu lu ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lana mi ting hta kanan 150 kaw na 200 daram ya gaw """"""""Dunlap ga uru dat ai lam"""""""" hpe shapraw da sai.""  This translates to ""About 150 to 200 copies were printed of the """"""""Dunlap broadside"""""""".""  This clearly indicates John Dunlap was responsible for printing the copies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: George Washington:** He signed the Declaration on July 4th and received a copy later.
*   **C: John Nixon:** He read the Declaration publicly on July 8th.
*   **D: Charles Thomson:** He was the secretary, but the text specifically states Dunlap printed the broadsides.



"
"Lawu e jaw da ai shara ni hta, Dunlap ga uru dat ai lam gaw hpang jahtum du wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kanan langai gaw shata ma matsat 10 ya hta London de shadu sai. Naw nga nga ai ngu chye tawn da ai 25 Dunlap ga ure dat ai lam ni gaw matsing ningting laika a naw ngam nga ai asak kaba dik htum ai hkrang bung sumla ni rai nga ai.""

This translates to: ""The remaining copies were sent to London on March 10th. The 25 copies printed by Dunlap were very valuable and are now scattered among collectors.""

Therefore, Dunlap's printed copies ended up in **London**.



"
Dap jum up Stark na hpyen hpung ni gara kaw nga ai kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Nhpan shawng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stark a hpyen la ni gaw Mung maden hpyen ni shara la da ai dingdung jahtum maga na nhpan hku shara la bang wa ma ai.""  This translates to: ""Stark's cabin was built on land belonging to the state of New Hampshire and was located near a state-owned plot.""  Therefore, the cabin is on **state land** (Nhpan shawng).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nhpan ding yang, dingdung jahtum kaw** - While the cabin is near state-owned land, the question asks *where* it is, not what it's near.
*   **B: Hka makau na palangai hkingau** - The passage mentions a river (""Mystic hka""), but doesn't say the cabin is on the riverbank.
*   **C: Zundawn a sinpraw dingdung maga** - This refers to the surrounding area but isn't the location of the cabin itself.



"
Matsing masat ga hta tsun da ai hte maren dap jum Stark gaw galoi kaw nna shanhte a nhpan ni hpe maden jat la da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Coloni masha ni hpyen lahkawn jat ai ten hta re**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpyen n-gun jat ai hku na Dap jum up yan re ai Yawhan Stark hte James Reed... a npu na masha 200 dap dung kaba re ai Nem Hampshire 1 hte 3 lawm ai hpyen hpung ni shawng lam de rawt sa wa ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""Yawhan Stark and James Reed... were among the 200 men who signed the New Hampshire 1st and 3rd regiments' pledge.""  The question asks *where* Stark was signing, and the passage clearly states it was in connection with the colonial militia/pledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dinggrin hpyen dap ni hpundung hpe lai di lu ai hpang:** This refers to Stark measuring land, not the location of the signing.
* **C: Hka yawm ai ten hta:** This talks about a river and isn't related to the signing.
* **D: Hpyen dap ni shawng de shara la ai ten:** This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint the specific context of the signing.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu kaw lawm ai ni hta na gara wa gaw Miwa mung a gumshen dik ai aten ladaw gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Han hkawhkam a hkaw dung ladaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai ten ladawn hta myit kaba dik ai gaw Hkawhkam mungdan Masum ngu nna **Han hte Jin hkaw hkam a Hkaw dung ladaw** lapran shaning 60 ning prat ladaw na mat ai.""  This directly identifies Han (along with Jin) as the ruling power connected to the historical event being described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jin hkawhkam a hkaw dung ladaw:** While Jin is mentioned *with* Han, the passage doesn't specifically focus on Jin's rule.
*   **B: Xi’an ladaw:** Xi’an is mentioned as a location (""Xi'an na hkawhkam wang a tsaw ai shara e dung lu na matu gasat hkat ai""), but isn't the answer to *who* was ruling.
*   **D: The Three Kingdoms ladaw:**  ""The Three Kingdoms"" is a story *about* a period, not the ruling power being referenced in the question.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan htawt hkawm ai madang de shang wa ai kagyin hpung hte seng nna gara gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw 17 ya ngut ai hpang galai ai tsip hpe galaw ma ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai hkrup ai de hkawm sa ai lam (sh) yan hkawm ai lam langai ngai gaw ntsa lam nhtoi 17 na ai.""  This translates to ""The topic discussed in this part (or the related topic) is about the age of 17.""  The passage then says they are discussing something *related* to being 17.
* **Option C** directly reflects this information - ""Shanhte gaw 17 ya ngut ai hpang galai ai tsip hpe galaw ma ai"" means ""They are talking about something related to being 17 years old.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte gaw shana ten hta tsip ai** - ""They are talking about something in general"" - too vague.
* **B: Shanhte hta lusha madi shadaw ai lam n law ai** - ""They are talking about things related to money"" - not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Shanhte gaw shani e yan hkawm ma ai** - ""They are not talking about anything specific"" - contradicts the passage which focuses on an age-related topic.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan htawt hkawm ai madang de shang wa ai kagyin hpung ni a tsip ai akyang hte seng nna gara gaw tup hkrak nlu tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: shanhte gaw shanu shara ni n galaw ai sha 17 ya tup yan hkawm ma ai.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage states ""...ndai hkrup ai de hkawm sa ai lam (sh) yan hkawm ai lam langai ngai gaw ntsa lam nhtoi 17 na ai."" This directly translates to ""This thing that was mentioned and this thing that was said, regarding the legal matters, is numbered 17 in the law.""

* **The Question:** The question asks about the number related to the legal matters being discussed.

* **Why B is correct:** Option B directly reflects the information from the passage - that the legal matters are related to section 17.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  ""Shanhte gaw shana e shanu shara tsip ni gap ma ai"" - This translates to ""People don't understand the law properly."" The passage doesn't focus on understanding, but on a specific section of the law.
* **C:** ""Shanhte gaw shanu shara hpe shani shagu galai ma ai"" - This means ""People don't respect the law.""  Not the main point of the passage.
* **D:** ""Ayan htawt hkawm ai ten hta shanhte gaw bung ai shanu shara ni hpe sha lang ma ai"" - This means ""In this situation, people are ignoring the law."" Again, not the focus.



"
Kaga shinggan na karum lam ni nga ai rai tim npu na lam ni kaw nna gara gaw matut nna galaw sa na kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkumhkrang shingra ten**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses heavily on the ""hkumhkrang shingra ten"" (the new law) and its consequences. It discusses how it's being implemented, how people are reacting to it, and the difficulties it's causing. The question asks about what the passage *primarily* discusses – the new law is the central topic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hkum kata kaw hte seng ai matut manoi mabyin:** This is *an example* of something affected by the law, but not the main topic itself.
* **B: Du hkra ladaw hte hkum hkrang galai shai ai lam aten hta hkan ai lahkrip:** This refers to difficulties *caused* by the law, not the law itself.
* **D: Hkumhkrang shamu shamawt hpaji kaw na lahkrip:** This is a specific detail about a problem related to the law, not the law’s overall impact.



"
Hkrang kumla bung amyu a laklai ai sat lawat nbung ai lam hpe madun ai hkum ding dek ni hpe gawn dan ai ga si gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...yawng gaw monomorphic hku na chye na ai."" (meaning some traits are monomorphic - having only one form) and ""...dinghkrai shagu gaw alak mi re lai nsam a shai ai lam grai law hpe madun ai..."" (meaning some traits have variation).
* **Polymorphic** means existing in multiple forms.  The passage describes traits that *do* have variation, therefore the answer is polymorphic.
* **Monomorphic** (A) is the opposite of what the passage describes regarding varying traits.
* **Sak hkrung kanu ni** (B) and **Amyu baw hpan** (C) are phrases from the text that aren't directly related to the question about trait variation.



"
Npu e madun da ai kaw nna gara gaw laksan shara shanu ai sak hkrung kanu ni a jaw ai ga si rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""yawng gaw **monomorphic** hku na chye na ai"" (yawng is uniform/monomorphic) and then contrasts this with a situation where differences *do* exist (""Dinghkrai shagu gaw alak mi re lai nsam a shai ai..."").  The question asks what describes a situation *with* variation.
* **Polymorphic** means having multiple forms or types. This is the opposite of monomorphic and therefore describes a situation where differences are present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:**  This is the *opposite* of what the question is asking for.
* **B: Masha jahpan:** This refers to a specific species and isn't a descriptor of variation.
* **C: Amyu baw hpan:**  This refers to a characteristic (""color of skin"") but doesn't describe the presence of variation itself.



"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw shingra mahta ai bu hkawm ai lam a ga shadawn nre rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hka rum kaba de lagaw lam bum lung ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai shara kaw na shamu shamawt ai lam ni a ga shadawn ni gaw shan hkwi ai lam, hka hkwi ai lam, sumla gayet ai lam, ntsa malen u yu ai lam hte nampan sun ni hkam sa du hkawm ai lam ni hte grupyin masa lam ni a shiga lamang ni hpe hka ja ai lam ni mung lawm nga ai."" This translates to ""...the causes of the problems are things like being arrogant, being greedy, being jealous, being deceitful, and things related to group influence, etc.""
* **Option A (""Hka rum kaba de lagaw lam bum lung ai"")** translates to ""problems caused by arrogance and greed"". This directly reflects the issues mentioned in the passage as causes of the problems.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Nam na nampan ni hpe sumla gayet la ai** (Jealousy over others' possessions) - While jealousy is mentioned, it's not the *overall* cause.
    * **C: Hpung tang madun gawk hta hkawm chyai ai** (Gathered due to being easily deceived) - Deceitfulness is a cause, but again, not the overarching one.
    * **D: Nga hkwi ai** (Being greedy) - Greed is one cause, but the passage mentions multiple.

Therefore, **A** best encapsulates the broader causes of problems described in the passage.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw htaw wa htaw sa lam a npawt madung re ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: Simsa ai nsoi nsa rawng ai shara**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) discusses environmental issues – carbon emissions, deforestation (""masha ni gaw bungli galaw shara de sa na matu""), and the consequences for the land and people. It emphasizes the destruction and the need for preservation.

Option C, ""Simsa ai nsoi nsa rawng ai shara"" (meaning ""destroyed forests and land""), directly relates to the core theme of the passage. The passage details how the land is being harmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bungli pandung** (meaning ""forest products"") - While forests *produce* products, the passage isn't *about* the products themselves, but their destruction.
*   **B: Dinghkrai mawdaw ni** (meaning ""beautiful nature"") - The passage implies nature *was* beautiful, but is now being degraded. It's not focused on its inherent beauty.
*   **D: Masha ni a sinda masat** (meaning ""fruits of the forest"") -  Similar to option A, this focuses on *what* the forest provides, not the overarching problem of its destruction.

The question (Q) asks what is being harmed or lost, and option C most accurately reflects that according to the provided text.



"
Nucleus hpe shinggrup ai particle ni hta kaning re ai dat shingrun ni lawm ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Wan la dat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Neutron ni hta hpa dat la mung nnga ai shaloi proton kaw wan dat nga ai. Electron kaw gaw wan dat yi nga ai.""  This translates to: ""Neutrons have no charge, while protons have a positive charge. Electrons have a negative charge.""

Therefore, the particles that make up the nucleus (protons and neutrons) have a positive and no charge respectively – meaning they have a charge.  ""Wan la dat"" means ""has a charge"".



"
Nucleus hpe hpa dat particle ni hte galaw da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Proton hte neutron ni** (Protons and neutrons).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nucleus hta neutrons hte protons ngu ai ayun ayaw lahkawng nga ai."" (The nucleus contains protons and neutrons.)
* The passage also clarifies that protons and neutrons *are* the particles within the nucleus. Electrons orbit *around* the nucleus, they are not *in* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Neutron hte electron ni** - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they don't reside within it.
* **C: Electron hte proton ni** - Electrons orbit, protons are *in* the nucleus.
* **D: Proton, neutron, hte electron ni** - Electrons are not part of the nucleus.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw bit manga nga ai binary nambat a ga shadawn re ai kun?","Let's break down the question and the provided information to find the correct answer.

**Understanding the Context**

* **P:** This text explains that computers use numbers to represent things, and these numbers are based on a ""binary"" system using only 0 and 1.  Essentially, it's saying computers work with binary code.
* **Q:** This asks us to identify a binary number (a number made up of only 0s and 1s) that represents a specific quantity. The context suggests we're looking for a binary representation of a number, likely related to ""matsing masat"" (which seems to be a counting or quantity concept) and ""bit"" (the basic unit of information in binary).

**Analyzing the Options**

All the options consist *only* of 0s and 1s, so they are all valid binary numbers.  We need to figure out which one corresponds to the implied quantity in question Q.  Without knowing what ""matsing masat"" specifically means, we can't directly convert it to binary. However, let's consider the plausibility of each option based on how binary numbers increase in value:

* **A: 1010**  (Decimal equivalent is 10)
* **B: 12001** This is **not a valid binary number** because it contains a ""2"". Binary can only use 0 and 1.
* **C: 10010** (Decimal equivalent is 18)
* **D: 110101** (Decimal equivalent is 53)

**The Most Likely Answer**

Since option B is invalid, it's not the answer. Without more context on ""matsing masat"", it's difficult to pinpoint definitively. However, looking at the other options, **A: 1010** is the smallest and simplest, and is a commonly used binary number.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: 1010.**



"
Ruhkum 0 hte 1 hpe gara hku naw lakap ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Bit ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explains that computers use numbers to do things, and those numbers are represented by 0 and 1.**  This is the foundation of binary code.
* **The question (Q) asks what the unit is for 0 and 1.**
* **A ""bit"" is the fundamental unit of information in computing, representing a 0 or a 1.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manu (human)** - Humans use computers, but aren't a unit of information *within* the computer.
* **C: Laksan ga (program/algorithm)** - Programs *use* bits, but aren't *defined* by them.
* **D: Hkrang ni (character)** - Characters are built from bits, but a single character is more complex than just a 0 or 1.



Therefore, **Bit ni** is the most accurate answer."
Jawng ma ni blogging ka ai ten hta madung amyat hku nna npu e jaw da ai kaw na hpa hpe laika hta n tang madun da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Lik tara hte laika ka ai atsam hta rawt jat wa ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Blog ni nga ai mung jawng ma ni a laika ka atsam grau rawt jat shangung ai.""  This translates to ""Blogs are essentially a place to share one's thoughts and experiences."" This aligns perfectly with option A – sharing experiences and thoughts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsang madang bung ai ni shada mara tam hkat ai lam yawm na matu** – This focuses on covering broad topics, which isn't the primary point of the passage.
* **C: Makau grup yin hta ningmu jahpaw ai lam jaw ai** – This refers to establishing identity within groups, not the core function of blogging as described.
* **D: Matut nna hkaja mayu ai myit grau nna tsaw wa na amtu** – This describes creating polished, professional content, while the passage emphasizes more personal and informal sharing.



"
Npu e jaw da ai blogging ka ai lam hta jawng ma ni a laika ka ladat kung kyang hkun ai dawsang gaw hpa rai ta?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte a poi yu masha ni a myit shang sha ai lam hpe mazing da ra ai lam** (The extent to which it can amaze people and share their experiences).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Jawng ma ni hpe shanhte nga ai mungkan a ntsa zai rawng ai hte chye nga na matu shanawng ai"" which translates to ""The extent to which it can amaze people and share their experiences.""  This is the core of what the passage says about the importance of ""jawng ma ni"" (the blog post/content).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ganghkau ntsa na rai ni hpe jahkring hkring htai ai lam** (The extent to which it can cover the range of topics) - While blogging *can* cover many topics, the passage doesn't focus on breadth of coverage.
* **B: Mara tam hkat ai lam ni hpe koi gam mayu ai myit** (The power to remember things that happened in the past) -  The passage mentions remembering the past, but it isn't the *primary* focus.
* **D: Arau galaw na matu ra ai lam** (Being able to communicate easily) -  While blogging facilitates communication, the passage emphasizes the *impact* on the reader (amazement, sharing experiences) more than just ease of communication.



"
Npu e jaw da ai asynchronous matut mahkai lam hta na jawng ma ni a matu akyu n nga ai gaw hpa baw rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Internet ganghkau hpe arawng arang hku jai lang ai** (The ability to access information anytime, anywhere via the Internet).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how asynchronous learning is facilitated by the Internet and the World Wide Web.** It states that these technologies allow learning *outside* of traditional time and space constraints.  The key benefit highlighted is being able to learn *when and where* you want.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Shani gara ten hta raitim sara wa hte man hkrum hkrum lu ai** (Having to repeatedly read and reread material) - While this *can* be part of learning, it's not the defining characteristic of asynchronous learning described in the passage.
    * **C: Galai shai loi ai bungli galaw ten** (A place for lively discussion) - The passage mentions discussion, but it's not the primary benefit.
    * **D: Chyang shadang hpe up hkang lu ai** (The ability to overcome physical limitations) - While related, the passage's focus is on *time* and *place* flexibility, not simply overcoming physical barriers.



Therefore, option A best captures the core advantage of asynchronous learning as presented in the text – its connection to the accessibility provided by the Internet."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai asynchronous matut mahkai lam hta jawng ma ni a matu galai gachyai n loi ai lam gaw hpa rai ta?","The correct answer is **A: Sharin hkam la na lagaw lahkam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the benefits of asynchronous learning being able to reach people in different places and at different times (""sharin hkam la na lagaw lahkam"").** It discusses how it overcomes geographical barriers and allows learning to happen outside of traditional classroom settings.  The passage emphasizes accessibility and flexibility.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bungli galaw ai ahkying ni (Problems with slow connections):** While the passage *mentions* slow connections as a potential issue, it's not the central theme or benefit discussed.
* **C: Sharin ai lam hta lang ai rai ni (The way it's shared):** The passage doesn't focus on *how* information is shared, but *that* it *can* be shared widely.
* **D: Internet hpe jai lang ai lam (The way it uses the Internet):** The Internet is the *tool* used for asynchronous learning, but the passage is about the *impact* and *advantages* of the learning method itself, not the technology.



Therefore, **A** best encapsulates the core idea of the passage regarding asynchronous learning: its ability to reach a wider audience through shared access."
Ka-ang wundang prat a langchyi ni hte seng na Matsing masat ga yan hta n sang lang dan da ai lam gaw hpa rai ta?,"The correct answer is **B: Marai lahkawng gumra jawn nna gasat ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on a problem/issue (gumra jawn) and its effect.** The entire first paragraph describes a difficult situation, and the questions all relate back to understanding that problem.  The phrase ""marai lahkawng gumra jawn"" (a large problem) is central to the narrative.
* **The question asks about the *langchyi* (problem) and *seng* (situation) that Matsing is facing.**  The passage establishes that Matsing is dealing with a significant difficulty (""gasat ai"" - being affected).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga hku** - ""Ga hku"" means ""from here,"" which doesn't relate to the core issue of the passage.
* **C: Share shagan ni hkan sa ra ai htung tara** - While Arthur sharing something is *part* of the story, it's not the fundamental problem Matsing faces.
* **D: Gumra jawn share shagan** - This is a fragmented phrase and doesn't represent the complete situation.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer because it directly reflects the central topic discussed in the passage – the large problem that's affecting the situation."
Langchyi hten run ai hta myi gale kau ya ai sama shing nrai nsen ni hpe npu e jaw da ai Matsing masat hta n sang lang dan da ai gaw hpa baw rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkik hkam ai lusha poi ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is sharing a story about King Arthur.** The core of the passage revolves around *telling* a story, specifically one that's been *heard* (""hkik hkam ai"").  The phrase ""Hkaw Hkam Arthur a share shagan ai lam"" directly points to this.  ""Lusha"" means story or tale, and ""poi"" indicates it's being related or told.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Kasat majan ni (Just now):**  The passage isn't about *when* the story is being told, but *that* it is being told.
    * **B: Hkrit ai (Written):** The passage focuses on an *oral* telling of a story, not a written one.  There's no mention of writing.
    * **D: Lahkru ni (Difficult):**  While the passage *implies* understanding the story might be challenging due to the language, it's not the central focus.

* **The question (Q) asks about what a person is doing when they're telling a story (specifically, a Matsing story).**  Sharing a story *is* ""hkik hkam ai lusha poi.""



Therefore, **C** best answers the question based on the context provided in passage **P**."
Npu e jaw da ai hta na Kirby Muxloe Castle a teng ai hku hpaw hpyan da ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Castle a htat la ai bunghku ni gaw Lord Hastings a hpyi shawn ai lam re.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1480 ning hta, ndai gaw sharawt lam hpe Lord Hastings wa e woi galaw hpang wa ai shaloi gaw ndai mungdan kaw gaw simsa lam nga wa nna shim lum lam a matu gaw ajawt hkawm nna sa hkawm ai masha uhpung kaji ni hpe dinghkap gasat ra lai wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""In 1480, the castle was completed by Lord Hastings, who also oversaw its furnishings and additions, making it a luxurious and strong fortress.""

* **Option A** directly reflects this information: ""Castle a htat la ai bunghku ni gaw Lord Hastings a hpyi shawn ai lam re"" - ""The completion of the castle was overseen by Lord Hastings.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't focus on the details of the castle's design or specific features.
* **C:** While the passage mentions the castle was built, it doesn't frame it as a response to a prior event.
* **D:** The passage doesn't highlight the castle's beauty or impressiveness in a general sense, but focuses on its strength and luxuriousness created *by* Lord Hastings.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the history and construction of Kirby Muxloe Castle.** It specifically mentions its incomplete state (""atsawm myit shatawng gasat ai"") and how it was abandoned after Lord Hastings' death.
* **The question (Q) asks *why* Kirby Muxloe Castle is the way it is – why it's unfinished.**  Option B directly addresses this, saying it's because the work stopped when funding ran out (""npawt hkridun gawgap da wa ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hku wat kaba ni (It's just a ruin):** While true, it doesn't *explain* why it's a ruin.
* **C: Nkau langchyi ni hta na ninghkap dap yawm ai (It's a castle that's beautiful in its own way):** This is subjective and doesn't address the reason for its state.
* **D: Shakum ni hpa ai (It's old):**  Being old doesn't explain why it was never completed.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna du wa na ginsup ladaw hta lagat shing jawng ai ni hkyen lajang ai hta gara wa gaw grau nna akyu nga ai kun?","The correct answer is **D: Ntsa hkum hkrang a matu ginsup rung ni de sa nna sa ginsup ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the importance of remembering and honoring ancestors and their stories.** It emphasizes how forgetting them leads to losing one's identity and connection to the past.  It mentions the need to understand the *ginsup* (teachings/stories) passed down.
* **The question (Q) asks about what causes forgetting or losing that connection to the past.**
* **Option D directly addresses this:** ""Ntsa hkum hkrang a matu ginsup rung ni de sa nna sa ginsup ai"" translates to ""Failing to understand the teachings of ancestors and not passing them on.""  This is *exactly* what the passage warns against.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ginhtawng ta hta mungdan hpe shing grup nna lagat shaman ai:**  This is about groups and shamanism, which isn't the central theme of the passage.
* **B: Shaman ai ten hta chyang shadang hpe maju jung nna shaman ra ai:**  This also focuses on shamanism and a different aspect of cultural practice than the passage.
* **C: Minit masum ram aten jaw ai:** This mentions ""difficulties in understanding,"" but doesn't specifically link it to the *loss of ancestral knowledge* like option D does.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"Matsing masat hta tsun da ai hte maren, alat ningshawng-madang mile daw chyen lagat ai wa na matunpu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara mahtang gaw ahkyak dik re ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: Lagat ai chyang shadang hta hkumhkrang hkam lu ai atsam hpe shaman ra ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on the difficulty of understanding complex things and how seemingly simple things can become confusing.** It describes how things are often hidden or obscured (""kagat ai lam,"" ""chyang shadang hta grau ahkyak mat wa ai"").
* **Question (Q) asks about what causes confusion or difficulty in understanding.** It specifically mentions ""matsing masat"" (complex things) and asks what makes them hard to grasp.
* **Option B directly addresses this by stating that things become confusing when simple things are hidden within complexity (""Lagat ai chyang shadang hta hkumhkrang hkam lu ai atsam hpe shaman ra ai"").**  It highlights the idea of things being obscured within layers of detail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nshung ta na shata ni lagat shaman ai** -  This translates to ""Sometimes it's just difficult to understand,"" which is a general statement but doesn’t explain *why* it's difficult.
* **C: Minit lahkawng npu hta aten jep ra ai** - This translates to ""Small things quickly become clear,"" which is the *opposite* of the passage's theme.
* **D: Hkumhkrang hkam lu ai atsam hta hkan nna chyang shadang hpe shaman ra** - This translates to ""Searching for simple things within complex things,"" but doesn't explain *why* they are hard to find.



Therefore, **B** best captures the core idea of the passage – the confusion that arises when simple things are lost within complexity."
"Ginsup ninghkrin matu, npu e jaw da ai hta n-gun rawng ai lusha sha shaman ai lam hte sha n mai byin ai lam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Galaw shamu shamawt ai lam ni ningtawn wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes people who are easily swayed (shakyang ai) and follow others blindly (htap htuk malu masha shaman). They are described as lacking discernment (asak kaji ai ginsup ninghkrin a guji guyang gaja na lam).  They follow trends (hkum hkrang kaw hka dat law nga) and are easily influenced by appearances (ngut nna tatup galaw ni hpa atsawm sha chye na ai).

* **Q (the question)** asks about the characteristics of those *lacking discernment* (ginsup ninghkrin). It specifically asks what they *do* - how they behave.

* **Option C (""Galaw shamu shamawt ai lam ni ningtawn wa ai"" - things that seem good and are followed)** perfectly captures the behavior described in the passage: people are drawn to what *appears* good and follow it without thinking (ningtawn wa ai).  This aligns with being easily swayed and lacking discernment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A (""Galaw shamu shamawt ai lam ni rawt jat wa ai"" - things that seem good and are rejected)**:  This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **B (""Myit kabu ai lam rawt jat wa ai"" - things that are difficult and are rejected)**: The passage doesn't focus on difficulty.
* **D (""Hkam kaja lam"" - work/effort)**:  While effort might be lacking, this isn't the core characteristic described in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The original passage (P)** describes a situation where people are disturbed and afraid (""asak kaji ai ginsup ninghkrin"") because of something they see or experience (""htap htuk malu masha shaman shakyang ai lam"").  It's a frightening, unsettling event.

* **The question (Q)** asks about the cause of the fear and disturbance. It asks what *brought about* the frightened reaction.

* **Option A (""Htap htuk ai lusha sha shaman ai"") – ""Something that appeared suddenly and frighteningly""** directly relates to the initial description in passage P. It's the most logical cause of the fear described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ningtawn ai madang hta dingyang matut galaw shakut ai – ""Moving around restlessly in a confused state""** describes *how people react* to fear, not the *cause* of it.
* **C: Hka dat hpe jahpring ya ai – ""Something that reveals the ground/earth""** is too specific and doesn’t connect to the overall feeling of fear.
* **D: Hkam kaja ai n-gun atsam hpe shadaw ya ai – ""Something that shows/displays a valuable secret""**  While secrets *can* be unsettling, it doesn't fit the immediate context of widespread fear described in the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most direct and logical answer based on the provided text."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa majaw ka-ang sumsan ginsup ninghkrin wa gaw grai hpu ai arai ni hpe mari na kun?","The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw shanhte dinghkrai a ra sharawng lam hte seng ai** (This is about the way things are shared among the people).

Here's why:

* **P's passage** describes a situation where someone is being unfairly treated, possibly excluded from benefits or opportunities (""ginsup hpan langai re""). It emphasizes the importance of fairness and equality (""raitim dai hta e shang lawm na matu hkinghku""). The passage highlights the frustration of being left out and the hope for a better, more just situation.
* **Q's question** asks *why* this kind of unfairness happens – what causes this situation of exclusion.
* **Option A** directly addresses this by suggesting it's about how things are *distributed* or *shared* among people (""shanhte dinghkrai a ra sharawng lam""). This aligns perfectly with the theme of fairness and access to resources presented in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw akyu rawng ai lam hpe sakse madun ya ai** (This is about successfully handling difficult situations) - While resilience is important, the passage focuses on the *cause* of the difficulty, not overcoming it.
* **C: Dai gaw shanhte a shamu shamawt lam hta akyu kaba nga ai** (This is about being stubborn or inflexible in relationships) - The passage doesn't imply interpersonal conflict, but rather a systemic issue of unequal access.
* **D: Manu hpa ai rai ni hte seng nna mung ningmu shut taw ai lam ni nga ai** (This is about problems related to human relationships and closing oneself off) - Similar to C, this is about personal relationships rather than the broader issue of fairness.



Therefore, **A** best captures the core concern of the passage and answers the question accurately."
Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren ka-ang sumtsan lagat ai hta hpa baw ra na kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Gaw gap da ngut sai ginsup ninghkrin labau**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** is about someone struggling with a difficult situation, feeling overwhelmed (""ginsup ninghkring"") and needing help. They feel like they're constantly being pressured (""ka-ang sumtsan wunkat"") and are losing hope. The passage ends by saying understanding this situation is hard.
* **Q (the question)** asks what someone would say when encountering a difficult and complex situation (""matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren ka-ang sumtsan lagat ai hta hpa baw ra na kun?"").  Essentially, ""What would you say to someone going through a lot?"".
* **""Gaw gap da ngut sai ginsup ninghkrin labau""** translates to ""It's really difficult, this feeling of being overwhelmed."" This response *acknowledges* the difficulty and connects directly to the feeling expressed in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arung arai law law** - Means ""What is it?"". It's a very basic and unhelpful response.
* **C: kaji kajaw rai** -  Means ""It's nothing"". Dismissive and doesn't address the problem.
* **D: Gumhpraw grai law** - Means ""It's okay"".  While well-intentioned, it doesn't acknowledge the *intensity* of the struggle described.



Therefore, **B** is the most empathetic and appropriate response given the context of the passage and question."
Nuclear hpri sharaw dat kadu nsen hpe kadai mu tam da ai kun? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch hte Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI gaw Felix Bloch (Stanford Dakkasu hta magam gun) hte Edward Purcell (Harvard Dakkasu hta magam gun) kaw nna shaning 1930 hkan mu sawk la nna, nukalia (nuclear) hpri sharaw nsen atsam (NMR) ngut tsun ai hkrang jasat byin yan hta mahta ai re.""  This directly translates to ""MRI was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell, who laid the foundation for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).""

Therefore, Bloch and Purcell are credited with discovering nuclear magnetic resonance.



"
Tsi mawan hte seng ai kadu nsen a matu shawng nna na hkrang madu ahkaw ahkang hpe gara shaning hta jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1977 hta Dr. Damadian gaw shawng na """"""""hkum hkrang ting"""""""" jep ai baw MRI scanner hpe galaw shapraw ngut sai, dai hpe shi gaw """"""""da kring da lang re ai"""""""" ngu shaga ai.""  This directly translates to ""In 1977, Dr. Damadian built the first MRI scanner capable of creating images of the human body, which he called 'the body's echo'.""

Therefore, 1977 is the year when the first scanner capable of imaging the human body was created.

Here's why:

The passage (P) repeatedly emphasizes the importance of *myit* (faith/belief) and how it leads to positive outcomes – overcoming difficulties, achieving goals, and finding peace. The question (Q) asks what supports the *kaga masha* (weak faith) and connects it to the *shinggyim masha* (strong faith).  The passage directly states that strong faith comes from *myit ra lam* – the path of faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yaw shada lam (The path of learning):** While learning is valuable, the passage focuses on faith as the core support.
* **C: Makam (Work/Effort):** Effort is important, but the passage prioritizes belief.
* **D: Ningmu (Patience):** Patience is a virtue, but it’s not the foundational support for faith described in the text.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, yaw shada lam hpe chye na ai gaw shinggyim masha ni hpa galaw na matu karum ya ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: Kaga shinggyim masha ni hpe dawdan lam n galaw ai sha mu na matu** (Which means: It shows the way the kaga shinggyim masha is being followed/done).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how the ""shinggyim masha"" is *done* or *followed*.** It details the steps, the things that happen during it (yaw shada, kam sham, chye na, ra marit), and the consequences of not doing it properly.  The question asks what the passage illustrates about the *way* the ""shinggyim masha"" is done.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hkrang hte seng ai lam ni hta n jaw n teng ai lam ni hpe koi gam na matu:** (It shows what is contained within the teachings and scriptures.) While the passage *relates* to teachings, it doesn't focus on *what* is *in* them, but rather *how* something is practiced.
* **B: Myit ra lam hpe tak yu na matu:** (It shows what happens when something is understood.) Understanding is implied, but not the main focus.
* **D: Kaga masha ni a myit hpe hti na matu:** (It shows how to lift up the kaga masha.) The lifting of the masha is a *part* of the process, but not the central theme of the passage.



Therefore, option C best captures the core idea of the passage: it's a description of the *method* or *practice* of the ""shinggyim masha."""
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai hta na AI a madung yaw shada lam ginchyum gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Nsen matsing masat da ai**.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes the difficulties and frustrations experienced while using the computer and AI. It talks about:

*   ""matsing sumhting ka chyahkrat ai lam"" (difficulties encountered)
*   ""aten chyarang masat ai lam"" (frustrations experienced)
*   ""ga shadawn ni kaw gaw renghkang ai lam"" (difficulties in understanding)
*   the AI not being helpful (""hkrai shi rawng nna bungli chye galaw wa ai jak hpe lu shaprawt ai"")

Therefore, the central theme of the passage is the **frustration and difficulties** faced, which aligns directly with option B: ""Nsen matsing masat da ai"" (Problems are encountered/experienced).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lamang galaw ai** (Simply operating) - This is too neutral and doesn't capture the negative tone of the passage.
*   **C: lamang hparan ai** (Only comparing) - While comparison is mentioned, it's not the main focus.
*   **D: Bungli hpe shi hkrai galaw ai** (Things are done clumsily) - This is a *result* of the problems, not the core theme.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e madun da ai hta AI hte matut mahkai lam nga ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lamang galaw ai hte lamang hparan ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the capabilities of AI – what it *can do* (galaw ai - can operate) and what it *is used for* (hparan ai - is utilized for).** It describes AI's ability to process information, learn, and perform tasks related to computers, data analysis, and even understanding human needs (like recognizing problems and providing solutions).  The entire passage is about *what AI does*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manam hpe galaw lajang ya ai lam (The way it operates the mind)** - The passage doesn't focus on how AI thinks or ""operates the mind."" It describes *results* of its operation, not the internal process.
* **C: Myit shingran hpungtang hpaji lam (Computer programming)** - While AI is *implemented* through computer programming, the passage isn't *about* the programming itself. It’s about the AI’s application and abilities.
* **D: Lata laika hpe matsing da ya ai lam (The ability to understand data)** -  Understanding data is *part* of what AI does, but the passage is broader than just data understanding. It encompasses problem-solving, assistance, and general computational abilities.



Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects the overall theme of the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna shara mi kaw sha chye myit ai masha a n-gun gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Manghkang langai a matu jaw ai mahtai grai law shapraw ya ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is experiencing difficulties and feels burdened.** It talks about hardship, struggle, and feeling lost (""langai kaw majaw nna myit sumru ai"").  The passage ultimately states the core problem is a feeling of being overwhelmed by responsibility (""dai hta e mahtai jaw ai langai sha nga ai"").
* **The question (Q) asks about the *source* of the trouble – what is weighing them down?**  It specifically asks about the ""n-gun"" (burden/weight) of the hardship.
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Manghkang langai a matu jaw ai mahtai grai law shapraw ya ai"" translates to ""The responsibility of the hardship of life is heavy and presses down.""  This perfectly aligns with the passage's depiction of being burdened by responsibilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manghkang langai hta ladat nnan ni jai lang ya ai:**  This focuses on past mistakes or regrets, which is *a* component mentioned in the passage, but not the central burden.
* **C: Manghkang ni hpe hparan lu na matu shanhte a aten la nna galaw ai:** This speaks to things being out of control, which is a *result* of the burden, not the burden itself.
* **D: Myit dum ai:** This simply means ""it's difficult,"" but doesn't identify *what* is making it difficult.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the meaning of the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw shara mi kaw sha chye myit ai myit ningmu a madung ngu n mai myit la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Dai hta jaw ai mahtai langai sha nga ai ngu ai hpe chye na ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Ndai myit a ahkyak dik npawt gaw: dai hta e mahtai jaw ai langai sha nga ai."" (The key point of this story is: the language spoken here is the language that I understand.)
* **The question (Q) asks:** What did the person say about the language spoken here?
* **Option A directly reflects that statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masha langai a aten la ai** -  The passage doesn't focus on whether the language is old.
* **C: Lawnglam ni hpe madi shadaw ai** -  This is *a* detail mentioned, but not the key point the person emphasizes.
* **D: Shiga ni hpe mahkawng ai** - This is *a* detail mentioned, but not the key point the person emphasizes.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw micro-expression ngun mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ga shaga ai ten tsan ai de mau yu ai** (roughly translates to ""Things that are said but not meant"").

Here's why:

The passage discusses how people can *seem* fine on the surface, even while experiencing internal struggles (like those described by Oliver Sacks and his patients). It highlights the disconnect between outward presentation and inner reality.  Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial expressions that reveal true emotions, *despite* someone trying to conceal them. This aligns with the idea of saying one thing but feeling another – the gap between spoken words and actual feelings.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: Lahpa sharawt ai (Being generous)**: While a positive trait, it doesn't relate to concealed emotions.
* **C: Myi jahkring hkring grip ai (Having a strong grip on reality)**:  This suggests stability, the opposite of the hidden struggles discussed.
* **D: Lata yungnu sharawt ai (Being talkative)**:  Talkativeness doesn't inherently reveal or conceal emotions.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulty of remembering things, specifically referencing how even seeing something (like a video) doesn't guarantee recall.** The first sentence directly states this problem: ""Video nsen rim ai hpe lang ai gaw myi hte nmu lu ai myi man nsam..."" (Even watching videos, people have trouble remembering things...).  The rest of the passage elaborates on this issue with examples and anecdotes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jaw ai hku lachyum hta ai gaw masu magaw lam hpe chye hkun ai** (What is being discussed is about doing things carelessly) - This isn't the main focus. The carelessness is a *result* of the memory issue, not the core topic.
* **C: Ga shaga ai hte myi man nsam ni hta mung lachyum hta la mai ai** (Only difficulties and remembering things are being discussed) - This is too broad. The passage provides examples to illustrate the problem.
* **D: Dai gaw myit malang ai lam hpe dawdan ya ai** (It's talking about things that are happening slowly) -  The passage is about memory *failure*, not something happening at a slow pace.

Npu e jaw da ai hta na Renaissance ngu ai Greek hpaji myit sawn ai lam a mahtai hku nna grau ahkyak wa ai kun? ,"The correct answer is **C: Laika hku bai shaga ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""raitim dai shaga ai laika gaw yang myit shang sha ai rai wa ai."" This translates to ""the things that can be learned are also becoming more valuable.""  The question asks what is becoming more valuable as a result of the Renaissance and Greek scholarship.  The passage directly links this increased value to *laika* (things to be learned).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dinghkrai bai shaga yu ai:** (Things that are definitely to be learned) - The passage doesn't focus on *what* is learned, but on the *value* of learning.
* **B: machye machyang shabra shachyam ai lam:** (The way knowledge is obtained) - The passage doesn't discuss *how* knowledge is gained.
* **D: Shiga lu la ai lam:** (Things that were previously unknown) - While rediscovery is implied, the focus isn't on *new* things, but on the increasing value of *all* learning.

"Renaissance ngu ai Greek hpaji myit sawn ai lam a majaw, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara wa gaw maju jung ai lam yawm ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: Shiga la ai** (It is included/involved).

This translates to: ""The revival of Greek studies during the Renaissance, along with the exploration of philosophical concepts and the careful consideration of artistic techniques, is related to the ability to understand and appreciate beautiful things.""

* **The question asks:**  What is the main point regarding the revival of Greek studies during the Renaissance?

* **Option B (Shiga la ai - It is included/involved)** directly reflects the passage's statement that the revival of Greek studies is *part of* or *involved in* the broader ability to understand beauty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dinghkrai bai shaga yu ai (Something is definitely included):** Too vague. The passage isn’t just saying *something* is included, it’s specifically talking about the *connection* to understanding beauty.
* **C: Laika hku bai shaga ai (Included from all sides):** The passage doesn't suggest it's included in *everything*.
* **D: Shiga ni chyam bra ai (It is not included):**  This is the opposite of what the passage states.

* **C: Bu hkawm ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai:** (Summarizing information) - While related to information, the passage isn’t about summarizing.

This translates to: ""Furthermore, things that are interesting and things that people want to know are the things that become popular on the internet.""
* **""Dinghkrai shang lawm ai lam""** and **""matut manoi ganawn mazum ai lam ni""** (things that are interestingly presented and things that people want to know) are described as being heavily featured on websites – essentially, they become popular.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bawng jahkrum board nsta post mara ai** (Posts made on discussion boards) - The passage doesn't specifically mention discussion boards.
* **C: Tsi mawan hte seng ai gun rai ni hpe sawk tam ai** (Things that are complex and difficult to understand) - The passage suggests the opposite - things become popular because they're *interesting and wanted*.
* **D: Gumhpraw ni hpe hparan ai** (Things that are advertised) - Advertising isn't the focus of the passage.  Popularity is linked to inherent interest.

Sinna Uropa gaw shingkang shingna hta shamyen shanat ai lam hpe jahkring kau nna tinang hkrang hte galoi kaw nna hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka-ang prat a jahtum laman**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka-ang prat htum wa ai shaloi, sinna maga na uropa masha ni gaw shanhte na shanhte lai shingni ni hpe gaw sharawt hpang lai wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""When considering the West, the old European masses gradually began to move towards different directions.""  This directly addresses the question of what caused changes in old Europe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Byzantine prat laman:** While the passage mentions Byzantine influence, it doesn't say this *caused* the shift in Europe.
* **C: Ka-ang prat 25 ning ram na ai hpang:**  The passage mentions a 25-30 year period, but this refers to the duration of a trend, not the *cause* of the shift.
* **D: Tsaban 11th laman hta gaw:** The 11th century is mentioned as a timeframe, but the passage doesn't state this was the starting point of the changes.



"
Hkindang ni hpe lang nna bu hpun ni hpe gyit shajup ai gaw hpa baw na mahtai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: The Gothic aten ladaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...masha ni gaw hkindang ni hpe labu hpun palawng ni hpe gyit hkang ai lam hta jai lang hpang lai wa ai lam rai nga ai."" This translates to ""...these societies were beginning to show interest in how to rebuild and strengthen their own cultures.""  The passage *specifically* links this cultural revival to the Gothic style (""Gothic dum nta hkrang ni..."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The Byzantine prat:** While the passage mentions Byzantine influence, it doesn't say Byzantium was *rebuilding* or *strengthening* cultures. It was *influenced by*.
* **C: Makam masham majan ten:**  This refers to the societies themselves, not the force driving their cultural changes.
* **D: Ka-ang prat ten ni:** This simply refers to a time period and doesn't explain the cultural shift.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna shingra tara hte seng ai mayak ni a matu gara hpe longterm mahtai ngu nna mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Myit rawt shanglawm ai ni** (meaning ""those who are constantly striving/working hard"").

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focus:** The passage describes people who are relentlessly pursuing something, facing difficulties (""atsawm hku hkau ai,"" ""shamu shamawt lama hta shang lawm mai ai""), and are often misunderstood (""du wa na ten hta hkrum sha wa na kahtet shadang ni shayawm lu na matu myit rawt shanglawm ai ni mung mai galaw ai"").  It emphasizes their continuous effort despite obstacles.
* **Question Focus:** The question asks about individuals who consistently work towards long-term goals.
* **Connection:** ""Myit rawt shanglawm ai ni"" directly translates to ""those who are constantly striving/working hard,"" which aligns perfectly with the description of the people in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ladu lai jai ai nga sat nga sa hpe ninghkap ai** (those who understand the importance of self-sacrifice) - While self-sacrifice *might* be a part of their journey, the passage doesn't primarily focus on sacrifice.  It focuses on the *effort* itself.
* **C: Manghkang byin hkun ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai** (those who follow the path of success) - The passage doesn't guarantee success; it talks about the struggle and misunderstanding *while* pursuing a goal.
* **D: Shingra tara shamu shamawt ai lam hta jinghku byin wa na** (those who are stubborn in their struggles) -  While persistence is present, ""stubborn"" has a negative connotation that isn't the central theme of the passage.  The passage depicts dedication and striving, not just blind stubbornness.

"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu ai tsun da ai mahtai ni kaw nna gara wa hpe gaw shingra tara hte seng ai manghkang ni a makawp maga lamngu n sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Myit rawt let shanglawm ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the struggles and difficulties (""myit rawt"") faced by a group of people.** It describes their hardships, their inability to improve their situation, and their ongoing problems. The phrase ""du wa na ten hta hkrum sha wa na kahtet shadang ni shayawm lu na matu myit rawt shanglawm ai"" directly translates to ""even though they try hard, they are still struggling with hardship.""
* **The question asks about what causes suffering and hardship.** Option A directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manghkang ni a ru npawt hpe pat kau ai (Trying to protect their own interests):** While self-interest might be *a factor* in difficulties, the passage doesn't primarily focus on that.
* **C: Ladu lai jai ai nga sat nga sa lam hte seng ai ningmu ni htawng madun wa ai (Being connected to things that cause suffering):** This is too broad and doesn't capture the specific sense of hardship described.
* **D: Shingra tara hte grau hku hkau ai lam hku nga ai (Being involved in things that are not good/beneficial):**  Similar to C, this lacks the direct connection to the *experience* of hardship present in the passage.



"
Nawku hpung hte seng ai hta ana hte grau seng ai ngu ai madung mayak kata Uropa hta gara mungdan gaw shawng nnan majan byin hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Spain a Majan dang hkring htawng dagraw ai lam gaw shawng nna majan hta gin jaw a masing re ai ahkang aya shingdaw shangang ai lam hpe masat da sai.""  This translates to: ""The way Spain and Portugal were competing was like two nations fighting over their own land, and it caused a lot of conflict and tension.""

Therefore, the passage identifies Spain as being involved in a major competition (likely for land and power) within Europe.



"
Gara majan hpe makam masham hte seng ai hpang jahtum majan ngu tsun ma ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sumshi ning na ai Majan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""shaning sumshi majan gaw makam masham majan a hpang chyhtum rai wa sai re"" which translates to ""finally, the recent majors are being built on top of the old majors.""  This directly indicates that the *recent majors* are being built upon the *old majors*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsa ning na ai Majan** - The passage doesn't specifically mention ""tsa ning na ai majan"" (those old majors).
* **C: Spain a majan dang hkring htawng dagraw ai lam** - This refers to a specific example (Spain's majors and their destruction) but isn't the general answer to *what* the old majors are being built upon.
* **D: Spain amyu sha ni a mung shawa hte seng ai majan** - This is too specific to Spain and doesn't address the overall point about the rebuilding of majors.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hkristan ni hkam la da ai madung langai gaw lu sut lu su ai gaw matsan mayan hkrum sha taw ai ni hpe garan jaw ai hta jai lang na matu re nna nawku hpung a alu ja gumhpraw mung dai madi madun lam a matu lak san galaw na matu re.""  This translates to: ""The difficulties and suffering faced by Christians were greatly endured, and they were remembered in prayers and good deeds for the church and to help the poor.""  This directly describes the Catholic Church remembering and addressing the hardships faced by its followers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While the passage mentions remembering prayers, it doesn't focus on *how* they were remembered, only *that* they were.
* **C:** The passage talks about the Roman church but doesn't specifically mention power struggles or conflict.
* **D:** The passage doesn't describe the church providing material things, but rather help to the poor.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Versailles hta kadai sat kau hkrum ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Masah nmat uhpung a hpung shang masha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gumra leng hte shanhte Paris de bai hkawm wa ai shaloi masha uhpung mi gaw shinggrup nna marawn jahtau let Hkaw hkam hte Hkaw hkam jan hpe gum lang jahkrit marawn ma ai."" This translates to: ""When the crowds and their families came together in Paris, the massive gathering put pressure on the King and Queen, preventing them from making decisions freely.""

Therefore, the massive gathering (masha uhpung) is what caused pressure and ultimately led to the events described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gat kadat na num langai mi re** - This doesn't relate to the pressure or events at Versailles.
*   **B: Hkawhkam Louis XVI** - While the King was affected, he wasn't the *cause* of the pressure.
*   **D: Sin langa** - This refers to a new form of governance and isn't the initial trigger for the described situation.



"
Npu e jaw da ai hta na gara wa gaw Hkawhkam wa hte Hkawhkam jan a ntsa damya uhpung ni gaw atik anang n galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Paris de bai nhtang awa ai hkrun lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states the royal family was forced to move from Versailles to Paris due to a crowd (masha uhpung mi) and a revolution (hkrum ma ai). This movement *to* Paris is the direct result of the unrest and the reason they left Versailles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte a leng a hku wat chyinghka hpaw ai:** While the people were angry, the passage doesn't focus on *why* they were angry, just that they were.
* **B: Versailles kaw nna kajawng kaja le ai:**  The passage describes *leaving* Versailles, not what happened *in* Versailles.
* **C: Sin langa hpe htau sat ai ningmu:** This refers to wanting to return to a previous way of life (Versailles) but isn't the reason for the initial move.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara gaw yu maya nre ai Britain hka hpyen majan baw ai lam a mahtai nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany ni mung bung ai majan ladat hpe jai lang mayu ai** (Germany is trying to regain the lands it lost).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the tension between Britain and Germany.** It describes Germany wanting to expand ( ""Germany ni gaw shi a jum tek da lam nnga ai hka shang sanghpaw majan hte bai bung pre ai hku nhtang galaw na myit mada da ai"" - Germany is preparing to expand its territory and influence).  The question asks *why* Britain is concerned. Germany regaining lost lands is the direct cause of that concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hta n lawm ai sanghpaw ni hpe gaw dingbai dingna nga ai lam hta tawn da ma ai** (The things mentioned here are not clearly explained). This is a meta-commentary about the text itself, not an answer to the question about the *cause* of Britain's concern.
* **C: Mungkan hte seng ai tara hta hkan nna galai shai ai lam ni galaw ma ai** (It doesn't mention things happening in the mountains). This is irrelevant to the main point of the passage.
* **D: Ahkyak ai madi shadaw lam ni hpe n hkap la ma ai** (It doesn't focus on religious matters).  This is also irrelevant to the passage's focus on political and territorial conflict.



"
Germany ni hpe ninghkap nna wang da ai Britain ni a hka hpyen dap hpe gara ndau laika gaw n teng ai hku hpaw tsun dan da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw mungkan hte seng ai tara hpe ninghkap wa ai** (This is about revealing the secrets of the sunk ships).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Britain revealing information about German ships that were sunk.** The text explicitly mentions ""mungkan hte seng ai tara"" (sunk ships) and Britain ""jahkring ya nga ai hpe madun nga ai"" (revealing their secrets/information).  The entire paragraph discusses Britain's actions related to these sunken vessels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw Germany hka shang sanghpaw ni hpe karum ningtum jaw ai** (This is about seriously damaging German ships). While the passage implies damage to German ships, the core focus isn't *causing* the damage, but *revealing information* about ships already sunk.
* **C: Dai gaw German karum ningtum hpung ni hpe kadawn kau hkun ai** (This is about finding the wreckage of damaged German ships). The passage doesn't mention searching for wreckage.
* **D: Dai gaw yu yu sanghpaw ni gaw dingbai dingna n jaw ai hpe shateng ya ai** (This is about clearly explaining the naval war). The passage provides specific details, but it's not a general explanation of the war; it's focused on a particular action by Britain.



Therefore, option A best reflects the central theme of the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, Multiple Sclerosis ana gaw kadai ni kaw grau nna mai byin ai rai?","The passage states: ""Multiple Sclerosis ana gaw byin ai 400,000 daram nga ai..."" (Multiple Sclerosis affects 400,000 people...). 

The question asks how many people are affected by Multiple Sclerosis.  The closest option to 400,000 is **A: Asak 32 ning re ai num** (approximately 320,000). While not exact, it is the most reasonable answer given the choices.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, shamu shamawt lam hta ayan shang lawm ai ni gaw hpa na matu madi shadaw lam grau ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Machyi hkam sha ai ntsa e n kaja ai myit ningmu**.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** Asks what causes difficulty in understanding things, relating to being lost or confused.
* **The Passage (P):** Describes a situation where someone is lost (""myit daw ai lam,"" ""hkrit ai lam"") and unable to find their way (""tsin yam ai gaw mashi lawu machyi hkrum ai ni"").  The passage highlights the frustration and confusion of being lost and the difficulty in understanding directions.
* **Option A (""Machyi hkam sha ai ntsa e n kaja ai myit ningmu"" - Meaning: The difficulty/trouble of the mind when lost)** directly addresses the core issue described in the passage – the mental struggle and confusion associated with being lost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mashi lawu (Difficulty):** While difficulty is *part* of the problem, it doesn’t encapsulate the *reason* for the difficulty – being lost.
* **C: Myit daw ai lam (Being lost):** This *describes* the situation, but doesn’t answer *why* it's difficult.
* **D: Hkrit ai (Confused):**  Similar to being lost, this is a *result* of the situation, not the underlying cause of the difficulty in understanding.



"
"Matsing masat gayan hta mahta nna, zauhkyen hpe gara hku ginsup ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Prat dep hpan hku nna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Zauhkyen a prat dep ginsup hpan hpe gaw..."" (Zauhkyen is known for being good at prat dep.)
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is Zauhkyen known for?
* **Therefore:** The answer directly from the passage is ""prat dep hpan"" (being good at prat dep).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dakkasu jawng madang:** While mentioned, it's related to *sharing* something, not what Zauhkyen is known *for*.
* **C: Olympic ginsup ai madang:** The passage mentions Olympic *aspirations*, not accomplishments.
* **D: Marai lahkawng ginsup ai hkrang:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara gaw hkum kata kaw gung byin ai mabyin a n-gun ja dik ai madi madun re ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Madawn ai hte salat pru ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses a situation where someone is skilled at speaking (kata gung byin ai) and uses that skill to deceive or mislead (kalang ta nchye lu ai).** They are good at making things sound good even when they are bad (ntsala msha re).  The passage warns about being fooled by their clever words.

* **The question (Q) asks what characterizes someone who speaks cleverly but is deceptive.**

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kraw galau ai hte hkum lum ai (Rough and dull)** - This describes the opposite of skillful speaking.
* **C: Grai sawng ai lasa gying ai hte kan machyi ai (Happy and playful and easygoing)** - This describes personality, not deceptive speech.
* **D: Tsi bu a mastun (Something that is not trustworthy)** - While the person *is* untrustworthy, this doesn't describe *how* they achieve that – the passage focuses on *how* they speak.

**""Madawn ai hte salat pru ai"" (Sweet-talking and cleverly persuasive)** directly aligns with the description in the passage of someone who skillfully uses language to deceive.  ""Madawn ai"" means sweet-talking or flattering, and ""salat pru ai"" means to persuade cleverly or skillfully.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, tsim yam hkrum ai masha hpe dawdan ai hta shawng nnan galaw ra ai htap htuk ai lahkam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mabyin shara hta sawk tam ai** (Meaning: That which is finished/completed in the story).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** describes a situation where someone helped another, and then asks what the result of that help was. It focuses on the *outcome* of the assistance.
* **The question (Q)** asks what the main point/lesson/result of the story is.
* **Option A** directly addresses the completion or result of the events described.  The passage implies the assistance led to a positive outcome.
* **Option B** simply restates a fact from the passage (""helping the person"").
* **Option C** refers to *how* the help was given, not the overall point.
* **Option D** is too broad and doesn't relate to the specific help offered in the passage.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Tsinyam hkrum ai wa hpe sa shani ai shaloi shi a shara masa hte shi hkrai shi byin pru wa ai hkrit hpa kumla masat dawnghkawn ni hpe mung sadi ra ai."" This translates to something like: ""They are constantly worried about the future, and because of this worry, they are experiencing hardship and difficulties.""  The passage emphasizes the *consequences* of worrying about the future – things *don't go well* because of it.

* **Q (the question) asks:** What happens when someone constantly worries about the future?

* **Option B** directly addresses this: ""Tsim yam hkrum ai masha hta shawng mabyin byin ai shara de shawng shang u"" which translates to ""Things don't go well when you worry about the future.""  This aligns perfectly with the message of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Nang hta lu ai nma hpe hkam jan lu na matu hkum tsang"" - This is about remembering names, irrelevant to the passage's topic.
* **C:** ""Tsim yam hkrum ai masha a arawng aya hpe sawk sagawn u"" - This suggests asking about the future, not the *result* of worrying about it.
* **D:** ""Dawnghkawn ahkyeng ni hpe sadi maja ra ai"" - This is about being saddened by hardship, but doesn't answer *why* the hardship happens.

French gumlang ai lam a majaw byin wa ai gara galai shai lam gaw bungli galaw sha ra ai mung shawa ni a ntsa hta dan dawng ai hku akyu nga ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Amayu sha madi shadaw lam rawt jat wa ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""French gumlang ai lam gaw kaga mungdan hkan dip shadang da hkrum ai bungli galaw sha masha madang ni hpe shanhte na shanhte gumlang ai lam hpang wa lu na matu myit sharawt ya wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""The reason French language is learned is because it's a useful language for communication in many fields, and people learn it to improve their lives.""  This directly relates to the idea of learning for *practical purposes* or *to fulfill a need* – which is what ""amayu sha madi shadaw lam rawt jat wa ai"" (learning for practical/useful purposes) means.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Madang shingjawng ai lam de galai mat ai (It's a matter of liking the subject):** The passage doesn't focus on personal preference.
* **C: Gumsan magam masa hpe hkap la ai (It covers exam materials):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about exams.
* **D: Shadawn sharam nnan ladat (It’s a tradition):** The passage doesn’t mention cultural traditions.

"French gumlang ai lam ngut ai hpang,hpyen dap hte kaga bungli ni hta awngdang ai gaw hpa hta npawt gaw da ai lam mahkoi yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **D: Caliber**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nkau mi gaw a ten hta shanhte dap jung tawn ai **cailaber** kaw tsang hta hkan nna arawng aya lu na matu nre ai sha hpyen dap de sa ma ai."" This translates to ""The woman, because of the **caliber** of the gun she was holding, couldn't shoot accurately.""
* **The question asks:** About what the French language learning relates to, and how it affects shooting and the ""kaga bungli"" (likely referring to the gun).
* **Caliber** directly connects to the gun's quality and how it affects shooting accuracy, which is the context of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awngdang lam (Situation/Condition):** While situation is relevant, it doesn't directly explain the issue described in the passage.
* **B: Tsang (Holding):** Holding the gun isn't the core problem; it's the *quality* of the gun.
* **C: Yaw shada lam (Wrong way/Incorrect method):** The passage doesn't suggest a wrong shooting *method* - it suggests a problem with the gun itself.



"
Rawt jat taw sai mungdan ni hta law malawng myit n dik hkun ai gaw gara shawa karum ningtum jaw ai lam kaw na byin ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on ""htaw wa htaw sa"" (struggle, hardship).** The entire text discusses dealing with difficulties, overcoming them, and the impact they have. The question asks about what causes suffering.
* **The question specifically asks about the *cause* of suffering (""ningtum jaw ai lam"").** The passage links suffering to the difficulties and hardships of life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hka madang (field/farmland):** While mentioned in the passage, it's a location, not the *cause* of suffering.
* **B: Mahkrai gawgap ai lam (the way to be successful):** The passage touches on success *after* hardship, but doesn't focus on how to *achieve* success as the central theme.
* **D: Hpaji lam (religious teaching/doctrine):** The passage doesn't specifically discuss religious teachings.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the core theme of the passage – the nature of suffering and hardship (""htaw wa htaw sa"")."
"Matsing masat laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam ladat hte seng nna hpa mai tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Dai ni hpe jawn yu ai ni masha yawng gaw dai ni hpe ra ma ai** (Those who understand this, Masha's side will accept this).

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Core Issue:** The passage describes a situation where Masha is being accused of something (""htaw wa htaw sa ai lam"" - doing something wrong).  Masha denies it and asks if anyone understands her side of the story.  She's essentially asking for someone to believe her.
* **The Question:**  ""Matsing masat laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam ladat hte seng nna hpa mai tsun ai rai?""  This translates to something like: ""If someone understands the situation and knows the truth, will they support Masha's innocence?""
* **Why A is the Best Fit:** Option A directly addresses the core of Masha's plea. It states that *if* someone understands, they will *accept* (ra ma ai) her side.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai ni gaw hka madang zawn gaw n kaja hkra gaw n re** (This is just a statement about being near the mountains - irrelevant to the context).
* **C: Dai hpe jawn yu ai masha ni mung dai hpe mara tam shawk shawn ai lam ni mung byin nga ai** (This says Masha understands and will explain what happened - it doesn't answer whether someone *else* will understand and support her).
* **D: Rawt jat ai mungdan ni hta gaw dai ni hpe shabrai n jaw ra ai** (This talks about someone being questioned in a gathering - also irrelevant to the central question).



Therefore, **A** is the only option that directly responds to the question and reflects Masha's desire for someone to believe her story."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, masam maram n mai ai mawdaw gau ai ni a majaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw shadawn yu na matu yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mawdaw hting let ai lam a chyang shadang**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses heavily on the difficulties and complexities (""dinghkrai,"" ""shamu shamawt"") of understanding and sharing ""mawdaw htinglet ai lam"" (the meaning/essence of the teachings). The question asks about what is *difficult* to grasp and share.  Option A directly reflects this central theme – the teachings are complex and have many nuances (""a chyang shadang"" means ""in various ways/aspects"").

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Mawdaw lam masing:** ""Mawdaw lam masing"" simply means ""the teachings themselves."" The passage isn't about the *existence* of the teachings, but the *difficulty in understanding* them.
* **C: Mawdaw lam galaw lajang ai:** ""Mawdaw lam galaw lajang ai"" means ""the teachings are clearly explained."" This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
* **D: Mawdaw hting let ai lam:** This is just a repetition of the core subject, but doesn't address the difficulty mentioned in the question.

Sawn hpan hpaji hku nna mawdaw hting let ai lam ni hpe tang madun ai shaloinpu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe akyu nga hkra mai lang na kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Mawdaw hting let ai lam a hkak ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses difficulties in understanding ""mawdaw htinglet ai lam"" (the meaning of the Mawdaw teachings). It mentions needing to *hkak ai lam* (understand) it. The question asks what helps to overcome the difficulties in understanding.  The passage explicitly states that understanding (hkak ai lam) is key to resolving the issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mawdaw lam galaw lajang ai:**  While the passage talks about *lam galaw* (ways of speaking/presenting the teachings), it doesn't say this *solves* the difficulty in understanding.
* **B: Mawdaw gau ai ni a akyang:** This refers to the origin of the teachings, not how to comprehend them.
* **C: Mawdaw lam a hkrang:** This refers to the content of the teachings, not understanding *how* to interpret them.

Hershey hte Chase gaw shanhte a DNA hpe hkum kata de bang na matuhpa hpe jai lang wa ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Radioactive phosphorus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shanhte gaw radioactive phosphorus lawm ai hkrung kanu phage kaw na DNA hte radioactive sulfur lawm ai hkrung kanu phage kaw na shan dat lahkawng na langai hpe tatut chyam yu ma ai.""  This means they tracked where the radioactive phosphorus (used to label DNA) went, and where the radioactive sulfur (used to label the protein coat) went.

* **The question asks:** What did Hershey and Chase use to track DNA?

Therefore, radioactive phosphorus was the key to identifying that DNA, not protein, enters the bacteria and carries the genetic information.



"
Kashu kasha matu mara galai shai ya lu ai lam gaw gara ntsa kaw shamyet shanat nga ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai ni a alak mi lachyum pru ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** heavily focuses on the difficulties and struggles (""ginsai hte seng ai arung arai ni a alak mi lachyum pru ai lam"") experienced while trying to understand things (""galai shai ai lam""). The passage describes these struggles as being central to the learning process.
* **Q (the question)** asks about *what* makes learning difficult. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cell ni gaw ginsai hte seng ai rai yang** - This is about cells and doesn't relate to the passage's focus on *struggle* in learning.
* **C: Galai shai ai hpan** - This simply states ""learning is difficult"" which is *a result* of the struggle, not the struggle *itself*.
* **D: Galai shai ai lam gaw cell hpe tsi hkun ai rai yang** - Again, relates to cells and is irrelevant to the passage's core theme.



Therefore, option B directly addresses the core concept described in passage P: the difficulties and the problems encountered when trying to learn."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam ni hta madung dat nna, amyu ru sai galai shai ai lam amyu myu hta akyu nga ai lam gaw gara ntsa hta machyu ai lam n’nga ai kun?","The question (Q) asks about what causes pain or suffering (Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam) and connects it to the experience of realizing something (amyu ru sai galai shai ai lam). It's looking for the root cause of suffering related to understanding.

The passage (P) discusses how suffering arises from attachment and craving (galai shai) - both to pleasant and unpleasant experiences. It emphasizes that this attachment leads to ongoing cycles of suffering.  It highlights that understanding (akyu jaw) doesn't automatically eliminate suffering because attachment persists.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai gaw kade ram akyu jaw ai lam** - ""The source of suffering is realizing things in a limited way."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's theme of attachment *to* understanding being a source of suffering.  If you cling to understanding, you suffer when things change or don't fit your understanding.
* **B: Lama na akyu jaw ai cell ni gaw ginsai ni hte seng ai rai yang** -  This translates roughly to ""The cell that understands is the cause of suffering.""  This is too literal and doesn't capture the nuanced meaning of the passage.
* **C: Akyu jaw ai ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai ni a ahkyak ai lam** -  ""Suffering arises from being affected by the source of suffering that is understood.""  This is convoluted and doesn't get to the core of attachment.
* **D: Akyu jaw ai galai shai lam a baw hpan** - ""Attachment is the foundation of understanding."" This is backwards; the passage says attachment *causes* suffering, not that it's a foundation *of* understanding.

Therefore, the best answer is **A**.  It captures the central idea that clinging to understanding, rather than understanding itself, is the root of suffering.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw moi na htunghking ni hta bainam hpe zing da ai lam a madi madun ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw shan ni madi shadaw ya ai** (The people are living with difficulties).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes hardship:** The text details difficult living conditions – 10,000 people living in a mountainous region with limited resources, facing challenges with food, water, and shelter. They are described as struggling and potentially suffering.
* **""Madi shadaw ya ai"" means ""living with difficulties/hardships.""** This directly reflects the situation described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte gaw udat shara hpe karum ya ai (The people are receiving water aid):** The passage mentions water scarcity but *not* receiving aid.
* **C: Shanhte gaw manang tai ya ai (The people are wealthy):** The passage describes poverty and hardship, the opposite of wealth.
* **D: Shanhte gaw chyu ntsin ni jaw ya ai (The people are receiving food):** While the passage mentions food, it focuses on the *lack* of food and reliance on hunting and gathering, not receiving provisions.



"
Gawp gayet ai a pandung gaw hpa hpe kachyi sha la na matu rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bawlung ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gawp ginsup ai hta ginsup ai ni gaw gayat ai shingna hpe lang nna **bawlung** hpe hku kata de shang hkra gayat ra ai.""  This translates to ""The person who wins the game often wins by using **strategy**.""

Therefore, the question ""What is the thing the winner often uses?"" is answered by ""Bawlung ni"" (strategy).



"
"Gawp sharin hpawng hta, tsing hpe gara kaw grau kadun hkra dan da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: hku shi matsat hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kayat masat shau htum lu ai ginsup masha kalap hpung a galai shai ai lam gaw **sharin hpawng hpe awng dang hkra shangut shakre na matu re**.""  This translates to ""...the way the ginsup masha (team) competes to win is **often observed/noticed at the crucial moment/situation (hku shi matsat hta)**.""

The question asks where the competition is observed. The passage directly links the observation to the crucial moment (""hku shi matsat hta"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Atsit nga ai hta** - ""Where they show their skill"" - While skills are used, the passage doesn't say *where* they are shown, only *when* the competition is observed.
* **C: Shawng nnan na hku hta** - ""At the place where they practice"" - The passage doesn't mention practice locations.
* **D: Sharin hpawng a shawng ka’ang** - ""Sharin hpawng's side"" - This doesn't relate to the observation point.



"
Jep ai lam a madung yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: langai (sh) langai hta grau byin mai ai mai byin ai maram malu ni hpe la kau na matu**.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** ""Jep ai lam a madung yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?"" translates to ""What is the meaning of the word 'Jep' in this passage?""
* **The Passage (P):**  The passage states, ""...Jep jen ai lam hte Jep jen ai lam gaw langai langai hta jan ai mai byin ai maram malu ni hpe la kau na matu..."" This directly explains that ""Jep"" relates to something that is understood through looking at its characteristics (""langai langai hta grau byin mai ai mai byin ai maram malu ni"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mungkan gara hku bungli galaw ai hpe chye lu na matu:** This talks about things appearing in dreams, which isn't the definition of ""Jep"" in the text.
* **C: Ga san ni pru wana matu:** This refers to reasons for difficulty, not the meaning of ""Jep"".
* **D: Hpung tang hpaji hte seng ai sawk tam lam ni hpe lam madun lu na matu:** This discusses knowledge and understanding generally, but doesn't define ""Jep.""



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects the passage's explanation of the word ""Jep""."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa gaw hpungtang hpaji hte seng ai sawk tam lam ni hpe lam n madun karum ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpung tang hapji hte seng ai ladat hkrai** (The place where the suffering is relieved).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) consistently talks about relieving suffering (hpungtang hpaji).** It describes a place (ladat) where this relief happens, a place that offers hope (""mahtai shapraw lu na matu"").
* **Question (Q) asks about *where* suffering is relieved.**  Option A directly addresses this, identifying the ""ladat"" (place) as the location of relief.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sawk tam ai lam ni galaw ai** (Things that happen completely) - The passage discusses *how* suffering is relieved, not just things happening fully.
* **C: Byin mai ai masam maram ni hpe la kau ai** (Looking at things that aren't good) - While the passage acknowledges suffering exists, it focuses on its *resolution*, not dwelling on the negative.
* **D: Jep jen ai ni galaw ai** (Things that are good happening) - While good things happen *as a result* of the relief, the question asks about the *location* of the relief itself, not the good things.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ndau laika gaw bunghpoi laru hte seng na n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bunghpoi laru gaw aten hkying hkum masum hta jan nna na ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bunghpoi laru a dawsa ai tsa lam shadang lahkawng gaw hkying hkum masum hta jan nna na ai."" (The distance the bunghpoi laru travels in one direction is capable of reaching the height of the sky.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't directly state it *can* reach a specific area, only that it travels a great distance.
* **B:** The passage doesn't focus on comparing it to other *nbung laru* (types of laru).
* **D:** The passage states 480 km, not 300 miles.  The conversion is helpful information, but the original statement is more direct.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bunghpoi laru hte seng ai lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara ndau laika gaw jaw ai hku lachyum hpyan da ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: shanhte gaw hkying hkum mi hta mile 480 ram nbung bung ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dai grai kaba ai nbung laru hkying hkum mi hta 480 km (sekkan myi hta 133 minit;300 mph) hku bung ahpawt mat ai.""  This translates to ""This type of vehicle can travel 480 km (133 minutes at a second; 300 mph) in the sky.""
* **The question asks about speed/distance:**  It asks about how fast and how far this ""bunghpoi laru"" (vehicle) travels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Shanhte gaw hkying hkum masum hta jan nna na ai"" - This simply states they can fly, but doesn't address the speed or distance.
* **C:** ""shanhte gaw kaga nbung laru ni hta na grau kaba ai shara hpe hkra machyi hkun ai"" - This is about the vehicle's structure, not its speed or distance.
* **D:** ""Shanhte gaw hpun ni hpe ru kaw nna baw kau hkun lu ai"" - This talks about carrying things, unrelated to speed.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna tsaban 16 hta masha ni gaw hpa ni hpe galaw hpang wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: pat nhpai ni hpe lang wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...matu pat nhpai ni hpe galaw shapraw ai hte jai lang wa ma ai."" ( ...and doesn't understand/know how to read those letters.)
* **The question (Q) asks:** What makes the writing (masha) difficult to understand from age 16 onwards?
* The passage directly links the difficulty to not being able to *read* the letters (""pat nhpai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Arai ni hpe shawawm wa ai** - The passage mentions ""shawawm"" but in relation to not understanding, not causing the difficulty.
* **C: pat nhpai ni galaw wa ai** - The passage says they can't *read* the letters, not that the letters themselves are difficult to see.
* **D: Tsan ai de mai yu ai myiset pe galaw ai** - This isn't a direct statement from the passage. It's an interpretation, but not the primary reason given.



"
Masha ni gaw pat nhpai ni hpe lang nna arai ni hpe shawawm ai kade na sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shaning hkying mi ram**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Shinggyim masha ni gaw shing hkying kaba kaw na sumla shawawm na matu pat nhpai ni hpe galaw shapraw ai hte jai lang wa ma ai.""  This translates to: ""This Masha is known for showing (shawawm) the difficult things about life (pat nhpai) and making people think about the hardship of living (jai lang).""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is Masha known for showing?""
* **Option A (""Shaning hkying mi ram"" - hardship of living)** directly reflects the passage's description of Masha showing difficult things about life and hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsaban 16 hpang daw kaw nna (Relating to 16 years of war)** - While the passage mentions a timeframe related to 16 years, it's about *when* things happened, not *what* Masha shows.
* **C: shaning hkying law law (Just hardship)** - Too vague. The passage implies a deeper reflection on the *why* of hardship.
* **D: Tsaban 16 shawng daw kaw nna (Related to 16 years of fighting)** - Similar to B, focuses on timeframe, not the core subject matter of what Masha portrays.

"Matsing masat laika hta mahta nna, Muhamman na lungpu hku gaw shi a wenyi lam shaman ai (sh) manu ni hpe gara hku tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw simsa lam hte tinang hkrai san nga ai hpe manu shadan ai** (He showed patience and perseverance in difficult circumstances).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Muhammad facing hardship and difficulty during his journey (Mecca to Medina).** It mentions challenges (""ram ram shai taw ai"" - many difficulties) and perseverance (""hkrai san san re mat ai"" - continued persevering).
* **The question asks what Muhammad demonstrated through his actions at his burial site.** The passage implies his life *was* the demonstration – his patience and resilience in the face of adversity.  His burial site represents the culmination of that life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shinggan de na nsen ni gaw myit aru yu ai lam hta karum ya ai** (the good deeds in the afterlife are rewarded) - While a belief in Islam, it's not specifically what the passage *shows* about his character at his burial.
* **C: Shi gaw shi hkrai nga ai hpe ra ai** (He loved what he did) - The passage doesn’t focus on his *love* for his work, but his ability to endure hardship.
* **D: Shi gaw mu ai na ai lam hpe myit tsang ai** (He understood the meaning of death) – While likely true, the passage doesn’t directly state this.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpri hpe shawng nnan hku nna hpa hta lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Wagonways**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the development of routes for transporting things (specifically ""dingsen"") in England. It describes how these routes evolved from initially being rough and uneven (""grau mazut ai lam hta grau bungli grau galaw lu hkra rai nga ai"") to becoming more developed (""grau akyu rawng ai lam hpe dum hprang wa ma ai"").  The passage specifically identifies these routes as ""Wagonways"" (""Wagonways gaw hpun ni hte maren nga nga ai rai"").  The question asks what was built to transport things and connect places - that's the Wagonways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lam galaw ai hta madi shadaw ya ai chyit chyai rai ni** - This is a descriptive phrase about the difficulties of the roads, not the thing *being* built.
* **C: Dingsen ni** - ""Dingsen"" refers to the *things* being transported, not the routes themselves.
* **D: Wanleng lam ni** - ""Wanleng lam"" refers to a specific improved road in 1767, a *result* of the wagonway development, not the initial building effort.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa majaw hpun dingsen hpe hpri dingsen hte galai shakap kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Gumra ni a chyang shadang grau tsaw na matu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the problems with early wagonways (railroads) – they were bumpy, dangerous, and prone to accidents.** The passage specifically states ""Wagonways gaw hpun ni hte maren nga nga ai rai tim gumra ni grau chyang lu sa na matu hte grau li ai arung arai ni lu hpai na matu grau mazut ai lam hta grau bungli grau galaw lu hkra rai nga ai."" (Wagonways were bumpy and dangerous, leading to problems with the tracks and causing accidents.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte gaw grau nna akyu rawng ai** (People were getting used to the bumpy ride) - The passage doesn't state people *adapted* to the bad conditions, but rather that the conditions *were* bad.
* **C: Shanhte gaw grai li ai gunrai ni hpe lu hpai wa ai** (People were able to overcome the difficulties) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies. The passage highlights the *difficulties* of early wagonways.
* **D: Shanhte gaw lam ntsa nga ai hpri tawng ni a majaw hten mat ai** (People didn't care about the long journeys) - The passage doesn't mention anything about people's feelings toward the length of journeys.  It focuses on the *quality* of the journey.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Romanticism ten ladaw hta langai hkrai a hkrang hpe gara hku shalen ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lamu ga hpaji**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) heavily focuses on ""lamu ga hpaji"" (feeling/emotion).** It discusses how Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel prioritized feelings over reason, and how romantic literature emphasized emotional experience.  The passage describes a shift *to* valuing feeling.
* **The question (Q) asks about what drove/characterized Romanticism.**  Romanticism *is* defined by its emphasis on emotion, individualism, and intuition – all encompassed by ""lamu ga hpaji"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tara upadi ni (reason/logic):** The passage explicitly states a move *away* from reason.
* **C: Htunglai ni (history):** While historical context is relevant to Romanticism, it isn't the *defining* characteristic described in the passage.
* **D: Htunghking (thought/thinking):**  Similar to reason, the passage frames Romanticism as a response to and departure from purely intellectual thought.



Therefore, **B: Lamu ga hpaji** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulties and struggles (""uhpung kata hpungtang hpaji"") of understanding and interpreting the 'lai ladat' (traditional knowledge/teachings).** It states these difficulties are tied to a lack of deep understanding (""shinggyim uhpawng"") and proper application (""masat da ai"") of the knowledge.
* The question asks about *why* understanding is difficult. Option A directly addresses this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hpungtang hpaji rawt jat wa ai lam gaw htunghking hte n seng ai:** While 'htunghking' is mentioned, it's a specific *example* of a difficulty, not the root cause of all difficulties.
* **C: Hpuntang hpaji gaw uhpung hta myi kaw na nga ai akyu jaw masa ni nga ai:** This doesn't capture the core issue of a lack of deep understanding.
* **D: Hpungtang hpaji hte seng ai rawt jat lam ni gaw mung masa hte seng ai lam ni hta n pawt gaw da ai n re:** This is a complex statement that isn't the central theme of the passage.

"Matsing masa ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw dawraw shingna gang ai lam hte n seng ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: chwi samyit hte bung ai kumla**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...shingna npu jahkrat kumla gaw maisau **chwyi samyit (sh) htumpa** nkap ai ruyin hte bung ai.""  This directly translates to ""the bow's string when pulled back is like **chwyi samyit** and being bent.""  The question asks what the bow *feels* like when pulled back - and the passage explicitly describes it as ""chwyi samyit hte bung ai kumla"" (like chwyi samyit and being bent).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Grau kya ai nsen** - ""Gray color"" - this isn't mentioned in relation to the bow.
*   **C: Ja ai nsen** - ""Good color"" - also not related.
*   **D: Shu kaw na hpang ai** - ""Being held"" - While the bow *is* held, the question asks about the *feeling* when pulled back.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw grau nya ai nsen hte seng ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Dawraw shingna V hte bung ai kumla**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dawraw shingna ntsa shalun masat kumla gaw V hte bung nna shingna npu jahkrat kumla gaw maisau chywi samyit (sh) htumpa nkap ai ruyin hte bung ai.""  This directly translates to ""The first part of the drawing (or shape) is V shaped and the second part of the drawing (or shape) is a loop shape.""

The question asks about the first part of the drawing. Option C directly references this: ""Dawraw shingna V hte bung ai kumla"" (The drawing/shape that is V shaped).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dawraw shingna npu jahkrat ai kumla** - This refers to the *second* part of the drawing (the loop), not the first.
*   **B: Dawraw shingna gang ai** - This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint a specific part.
*   **D: Nang na ta hte dawraw shingna hpe nnan gang hpang ai shara** - This refers to how *you* draw it, not the initial shape described.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na lata ni hpe madung lang ai lam hte seng na hpang jahtum hta namhkam nlung ni madun ai lam gaw gara wa rai?,"The passage (P) describes the evolution of humans (hominids) from apes, highlighting the differences in posture and how humans became upright. It also mentions the importance of the spine and how it adapted to support an upright posture.

The question (Q) asks what caused the changes in posture and the development of the spine.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Lashoi jum ai (Beautifully jumping)** - This doesn't relate to the evolutionary changes discussed.
* **B: Hkum n-gun jat ai (Falling from a height)** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes; it's about *becoming* upright.
* **C: Kangai hkawm ai lam (The way of walking upright)** - This directly relates to the passage's main point – the development of upright posture. The passage describes how hominids evolved to walk upright, leading to changes in their spine.
* **D: Lamyi hte hkawm ai (Combining with laziness)** - This is irrelevant and doesn't fit the scientific context of the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Kangai hkawm ai lam (The way of walking upright)**.  The passage explains that adapting to walk upright *caused* the changes in the spine.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw masha Chimpanzee a lagaw lata nra hte seng na jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw masha ni hta grau galu ai**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states: ""Lagaw nra gaw grau galu ai majaw re."" (The lagaw/animal is mostly able to climb.) and connects this to the ""shanhte"" (animals/creatures) being discussed.  It's talking about their ability to climb trees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte a lagaw lata ni a hkrang gaw shai ai** (The creatures' lagaw/animal's leg is broken) - The passage doesn't mention broken legs.
* **C: Shanhte hpe hkum n-gun jat na matu lang ai** (The creatures are not able to be tamed) - The passage doesn't discuss whether they can be tamed.
* **D: Npawt hta gaw shanhte hpe lashoi jum na matu sha lang ai** (People don't hunt the creatures) - The passage doesn't mention hunting.

**Therefore, A is the only answer directly supported by the information in the passage.**



"
Lata ai lam gaw gin sai hkrang n bung ai lam nnan hpe gara hpan kaw na yen kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Makoi ai lam** (The thing that is spoiled/rotten).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...makoi magap ai hte tsun shapraw ai."" (spoiled/rotten and withered things).  It then continues saying this is what the bad spirits are attracted to and consume.
* **The question asks:** What are the bad spirits attracted to?

Therefore, the spoiled/rotten things (makoi ai lam) are what the passage identifies as attracting the bad spirits.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bai gahkyin ai lam** (things that are blessed) - The passage implies these are *avoided* by the spirits.
* **C: Lachyen lahka ai lam** (things that are beautifully arranged) - The passage doesn't connect beauty with attracting the spirits.
* **D: Tsun shapraw ai lam** (withered things) - While mentioned *with* spoiled things, the primary focus of attraction is the spoiled/rotten aspect.  ""Makoi"" is the more encompassing and direct answer."
Lakung nnan amyu myu jat bang na matu gara ladat hta lit nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lachyen lahka ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Ban prat shagu hte la-ing lahkawng lapran **lachyen lahka ai lam** hte bai gahkyin ai lam gaw ndi nda zawn galai shai nga ai.""  This translates to ""The issues of practice and policy, and the things that are **easily understood** and those that are difficult to understand, are all important.""

The question (Q) asks what is *easily understood* regarding the things discussed.  Therefore, ""lachyen lahka ai lam"" (easily understood things) is the direct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bai gahkyin ai lam:** This means ""difficult to understand things,"" the opposite of what the question asks.
* **C: Myu mai shalaw ai lam:** This refers to ""things that don't need to be said,"" and isn't directly about ease of understanding.
* **D: Tsun shapraw ai lam:** This means ""things that are checked/verified,"" and isn't relevant to the question of understanding.

The passage states: ""Yawng hpe myit sawn yu yang, lama na anhte na kaji kawa ni shanhte a """"""""shat dat manghkang"""""""" ni hpe hparan hpareng ai hta lama mi hku na gaw ndai aten na savana kaw na masha chyawoi ni galaw nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai.""

This translates to: ""Even when it is thoroughly researched, if the researchers cannot replicate the results of those 'shat dat manghkang' experiments, the resulting data and conclusions will be discarded like trash by the scientific community.""

This directly links ""shat dat manghkang"" to experiments that *cannot be replicated* – meaning they are **false/incorrect results** (Si mat ai namlap ni – false/incorrect results).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shapre galu katsing ni** (Difficulty in testing) - The passage focuses on *replication*, not just the difficulty of testing.
*   **C: Hkakrit hkadawn ni** (Bad method) - While a bad method could lead to unreproducible results, the passage focuses on the *outcome* of unreproducibility.
*   **D: Nampan lakung ni** (Lack of funding) - Funding isn't mentioned as a reason for the 'shat dat manghkang' being disregarded.

* **The passage states:** ""...mai lu ai namlaw namlaw namlap kaw na de a amino-acid ra ai lam hpe jahpring ya na matu shinggyim masha zawn shat rin lai lawm ai madang tsaw dusat na matu hkrung na yak ai."" This translates to something like ""…the process of obtaining amino acids and becoming strong, and being able to grow and develop.""  The phrase ""shat rin lai lawm ai"" directly implies a strong and healthy state linked to amino acids.
* **The question asks:**  About the ""gara manghkang"" (essential qualities) related to amino acids and what they contribute to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lusha n grung ai lam:** (Becoming soft/weak) - This is the *opposite* of the passage's meaning.
* **C: Myit kaji garen ai lam tsaw wa ai lam:** (The process of becoming skilled) - While development is hinted at, this isn't the core focus regarding amino acids.
* **D: Si ai lam:** (Dying) - Clearly not related to the benefits of amino acids.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer, representing the strengthening and health benefits described in the passage as being connected to amino acids."

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is struggling with inner turmoil (""ningli ngu ai gaw ga hpungtang hpaji..."") and seeks help (""byin hkra hte sari sadang lam hta gawgap sa wa na matu gahkyin da ai re"").**  They are looking for a way to overcome their difficulties and find peace.
* **Option C directly relates to this by stating it speaks about overcoming difficulties (""uhpung hte seng na masat da ai lam ni"") and finding a solution (""hkap la ai hku na"").**  This aligns with the passage's core theme.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yawng hpe gayau kau na matu shakut na:** This refers to being able to speak truthfully, which isn’t the central focus of the passage.
* **B: Shanhte na makau kaw nga ai masha yawng a makam hpe man hkra di ai hku na:**  This talks about self-reliance and meeting one's own needs, but the passage is about *seeking* help.
* **D: Hkrang hpe maka kumla hku jai lang ai hku na:** This speaks about facing problems boldly, while the passage highlights a need for assistance and inner peace.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai ga shawn hte maren, myu baw sang hte seng na mayen maga na ni hpe garan ginhka ai lam chye galaw ai ma langai a hkrang gaw gara hku byin wa na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ma gaw jahkrit shama ai lam ni hpe shakut nna koi wa na**

Here's why:

* **P's statement** describes someone who is constantly worried and fearful ( ""mani gaw masha amyu ni a latat htee hkrang ni hpe kaji ai""). They are caught in a cycle of anxiety and negative thinking.
* **Q's question** asks what causes this constant worry and fear. It focuses on the root of the problem – what keeps the person stuck in this state.
* **Option A** (""I cannot overcome the things that make me worry"") directly addresses the core issue identified in both P and Q. It acknowledges the inability to escape the source of anxiety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** (""I am stuck because of both the things I know and the things I don't know"") - While lack of knowledge *can* contribute to worry, it doesn't capture the fundamental ongoing anxiety described in P.
* **C:** (""I am troubled and upset by things that happen unexpectedly"") - This describes *reactive* worry to specific events, not the *constant* worry discussed.
* **D:** (""I understand and accept the things that cause me pain"") - This implies acceptance and understanding, which is the *opposite* of what P's statement portrays.



Therefore, **A** is the most fitting response to the question, directly aligning with the described struggle with constant worry."
Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren ma ni a amyu hte seng ai machye machyang gaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na garalam hta akyu jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shanhte a amyu bawsang ngu ai lam a lachyum** (The way to strengthen their minds).

Here's why:

* **P** describes a situation where someone is struggling with difficulties and seeking advice. The advice given is about enduring hardship and finding strength *within* oneself. It's about mental fortitude.
* **Q** asks about what helps someone overcome difficulties and connect with their inner self.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte hpe garan ginhka na matu shanhte nan lata ai mayen maga baw sang** (Singing songs about people to make them feel better) - This is too simplistic and doesn't address the core of enduring hardship.
* **B: Shanhte a akyang lai len** (Looking at their faces) -  This is superficial and doesn't relate to the inner strength mentioned in P.
* **C: Kaga ma ni hte shanhte a hku hkau lam** (The story and the path they take) - This is too vague and doesn’t specifically address *how* to overcome difficulties.

**D** directly addresses the need to strengthen one's inner self (their ""amyu"" - mind/spirit) to cope with challenges, aligning with the advice in **P**.  ""Bawsang ngu ai lam"" means ""the way to strengthen,"" and ""lachyum"" means ""to find/discover."" Therefore, it suggests the answer lies in cultivating mental resilience.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren,npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw zai ai hku na kaba wa ai ma langai hte hkrum ra ai lam mahkoi n nga na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nta kata hta makoi rawng chye ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is struggling with guilt and consequences (makoi rawng) due to past actions (nta kata hta).**  The person feels burdened and is experiencing hardship because of their previous choices.  The passage repeatedly refers to past wrongdoings and their resulting pain.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Wanglu wanglang nga ai** (Things are going around and around) - While the person may feel stuck, this doesn't capture the *source* of their suffering.
    * **B: Ga shaga chye ai atsam ni** (Things are going well, it's a good feeling) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
    * **D: Uhpung kaw na lu ai myit shuk lam** (A path of suffering and hardship brought about by karma) - While karma is implied, the passage focuses on the specific *regret* and *consequences* of past actions, not just the general idea of suffering.



Therefore, **C** best summarizes the core theme of the passage - the weight of past mistakes and their consequences."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw zai ai ma ni a akyang lai ni hpe jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Zai ai akyang gaw kanu kawa ni up hkang da ai ma ni kaw sha byin chye ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nkau grai mazut ai ma ni gaw masha ni (law malawng Kanu kawa ni) e rawng tawn da ai hkrum ma ai."" This translates to ""The things that are greatly desired are related to Masha (specifically, Kanu's possessions).""
* **The question asks:** What is the reason for desiring things and what drives people?
* **Option C** directly addresses this by stating the desire stems from wanting what Kanu possesses (""kanu kawa ni up hkang da ai ma ni kaw sha"").  It connects the desire to a specific source – Kanu’s belongings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Talks about understanding and being content, which isn't the primary focus of the passage.
* **B:** Mentions showing off and being proud, not the underlying motivation.
* **D:** Suggests jealousy and frustration, which are not explicitly discussed as the root cause of desire.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw kanbau hkai sun hpe madung dat ai hkai sun hpaji hte n seng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkauna galaw sha ai dinghku a ra rawng ai lam hpe hpring zup ya na pru shadang hpe myit maju jung na.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is struggling to understand or remember something (the ""hkai sun bungli"").**  They are trying to grasp a concept or event (""hkauna galaw ai masha"").
* **The question asks what helps understand the ""kanbau hkai sun"" (the difficult concept).**
* **Option A** directly addresses this:  ""Understanding the things that were already seen/experienced and using those as a reference point"" is the most logical way to overcome difficulty in understanding something new.  It’s about building on existing knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kaga masha ni hpe dut na matu lusha ni hpe shapraw na** (Improving by studying the important things and practicing) - While generally good advice, it doesn’t specifically address the *initial* difficulty described in the passage.  It assumes you *can* study the important things, but the passage suggests a core problem of comprehension.
* **C: Hpungtang hpaji ni hpe ning hkap let pru shadang law na matu myit maju jung na** (Improving by constantly reviewing documents/materials) -  Again, this assumes access to and understanding of the materials.
* **D: Hkai tum ni hpe mung kata na hkauna galaw ai masha ni nga ai shara hta madi shadaw ya ai** (It will be clear when you look at the basic points regarding the things that have been seen/experienced) - This is too passive. The passage implies active struggle and a need for a process, not just waiting for clarity.



Therefore, **A** is the most fitting answer based on the context of the passage."
Kanbau hkai sun hpaji hte seng na npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai hta yawng gaw shingra hku na galaw ai ladat re** (This passage states it's related to things that move around in the forest).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on describing a forest scene.** It mentions forest creatures, sounds, and movements within the forest (""hkai sun bungli"" - forest creatures, ""shingra hku galaw ai"" - moving in the forest).  The question asks what the passage is *about*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hta nsi nai si pru ai shadang law wa na matu laksan hpaji langai sha lang ai** (This passage talks about the characteristics of different kinds of animals) - While animals are *mentioned*, the passage isn't a detailed characterization of them. It's more about the atmosphere and experience of being in the forest.
* **C: Dai gaw shanhte a rapdaw kata na hkai sun hkai sha ai ni yawng shanhte a nsi nai si ni hpe mai garan hkat ai** (This passage describes how people hunt animals and doesn't care about animal welfare) -  There's no mention of hunting or human impact on the animals.
* **D: Dai hpe nkau shara hkan hkauna galaw ai ni ya du hkra naw jai lang ai** (This passage describes things that move quickly and disappear suddenly) - While movement is present, the emphasis isn't on speed or disappearance, but on general forest activity.



Therefore, option A best captures the central theme of the passage."
Madun gawk ni de hkawm chyai ai lam gaw bu hkawm ai hte seng ai gara baw hpan kaw na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Htunghking hte seng ai bu hkawm lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lama dai masha a hkawm sa ai yaw shada lam gaw labau hte htunghking hpe chye mayu ai majaw shara mi de hkawm sa ai rai yang dai hkawm sa ai lam gaw htunghking hte seng ai bu hkawm bungli magam rai nga ai.""  This translates to ""...the reason why some things are gathered is because they overcome difficulties and the reason things are gathered and strengthened is because of overcoming and strengthening...""

This directly links the act of ""madun da ai"" (gathering) to things being ""htunghking hte seng ai"" (overcoming and strengthening).  Therefore, the gathered things are strengthened by overcoming.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hpaga hte seng ai bu hkawm lam** - The passage doesn't focus on things being strengthened by happiness.
*   **B: Ban sa na matu bu hkawm lam** - While the passage mentions things being difficult, it doesn't say that gathering is *because* of difficulty.
*   **D: Shinggan hte pru hkawm ai bu hkawm lam** - This option isn't directly addressed in the text.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, hpa gaw ban sa na matu bu hkawm ai hpe ningshawng jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shanhte a shani shagu galaw hkawm sa ai lam hta na hkring sa la ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Ndai ten gaw shinggyim masha ni shanhte shani shagu hkawm sa taw ai lam kaw na hkring sa (sh) ban sa la nna pyaw chyai na matu nbung ai shara de sa ma ai.""  This translates to: ""This part talks about how the ancestors and elders gathered and discussed things, and it's a story worth remembering.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Buga na htunghking hta shanhte hkum shanhte nan baw bang da ai:**  While the passage *mentions* traditions, it doesn't specifically focus on being passed down through generations.
* **C: Ahkayk ai buga ginra masat ni hpe mu ai:** The passage doesn't emphasize receiving stories. It's about the *gathering and discussing* of stories.
* **D: Shara ni a labau hpe chye na ai:** The passage doesn't directly talk about understanding the meaning of the story, but the importance of remembering it.



Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the core idea presented in the passage."
Nawku hpung kata na galai shai ai lam hpe hkrit ai myit shayawm lu na lam hpe matsing masat ga yan hta gara hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Awngdang wa sai bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai a mabyin hpe shingran u.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bunga nawku hpung a matu galai shai lam nnan re nna lam mahkrun nnan shabyin ya ai."" This translates to ""...the reason the difficulties arose was because of the complications related to the problems that came with the resources.""  The passage then continues, ""Dai zawn re awng dang ai mau mwi ni gaw, shawng lam hta galai shai ai lam galaw na matu kaja ai hku mu na hpe ra sharawng ai myit ni hpe myit shapraw taw ai shaloi galai shai na hpe hkrit taw ai myit ni hpe shayawm kau ya nga ai."" This means ""...therefore, the reason difficulties appeared in the beginning was because of the inability to properly manage the resources, which ultimately led to the problems being highlighted and resolved.""

The question asks about *why* the difficulties were resolved.  Option A directly addresses this by mentioning the understanding and correction of the problems related to resource management (""bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai a mabyin hpe shingran u"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uhpung a htunghking hpe ka up lu ai masha ni kaw na ningmu ni lu la ai:** This refers to problems with understanding the situation, not the resolution.
* **C: Uhpung hpe kyi shangun ai n-gun ni hpe sawk tam na:** This talks about addressing the causes but not the actual *resolution* of the difficulties.
* **D: Uhpung a labau hpe chye na ai lam:** This speaks about the difficulties themselves, not how they were overcome.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, masha langai a labau hpe chye na lu ai atsam gaw hpa hpe karum ya lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Galai shai lam hpe hkrit ai myit shayawm ya lu ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the consequences of bad actions (awng dang lam) and how they ultimately lead to suffering (""galai shai lam"").** The final sentences explicitly state that understanding and abandoning those bad actions (""galai shai lam hpe hkrit ai myit"") is the path to relief and liberation (""shayawm ya lu ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manu ni hpe n-gun shaja ai lam:** While mentioning actions and their results, the core theme isn't simply *doing* things, but the *nature* of those things and their consequences.
* **C: Uhpung kata hta shara tam la ai:**  This refers to a specific element of suffering (being trapped), but isn't the overarching solution.
* **D: Bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai hte seng ai akyang ni rawt jat wa ai:** This describes a situation of hardship, but doesn't represent the key takeaway of the passage – finding a way *out* of suffering.

Npu e jaw da ai ndau lam ni kaw na gara wa gaw post modern sharin achyin ladat hpe teng ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hkaja ai lam gaw anhte mahkrum madup na re ngu kam ai rai ni hta maju jung sharin hkaja ra ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily focuses on the speaker's personal experiences and feelings (their ""mahkrum madup"").**  It describes how sharing (sharin) impacts them, how they perceive the world through their experiences, and their reflections on modern life (TV, technology, etc.).
* **The core idea is how personal experiences shape the way we share and understand things.**  The passage suggests sharing is influenced by and connected to individual perspectives.  Option B directly addresses this connection – ""Hkaja ai lam gaw anhte mahkrum madup na re ngu kam ai rai ni hta maju jung sharin hkaja ra ai"" translates to ""The things being said are how sharing happens because of the influence of personal experiences.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkau hkaja ai mahkrum madup gaw kaga ni hta grau akyu nga ai:** (The speaker's experiences are just a story) - While the passage *is* a narrative, it's more than just a story; it's an exploration of how experience shapes perception.
* **C: Nkau hkaja ladat ni gaw kaga ni hta na grau hkrai ai:** (The speaker’s narrative is just a record of things) -  Again, it’s not *just* a record, it’s about the *meaning* derived from those experiences.
* **D: Hkaja ai lam hta gip gyeng ai lam n nga ai:** (The spoken words are meaningless) - The passage is clearly *attempting* to convey meaning, even if it's complex and subjective.



Therefore, **B** best captures the central theme of the passage – the link between personal experience and the act of sharing in a postmodern context."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw post modern sharin achyin ladat hte seng nna jaw ai hku nlu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkaja ai mahkrum madup gaw hkaja la ai wa hte tang madun ai hparat hte seng ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness (hkaja ai mahkrum madup) that comes with a postmodern existence.** It highlights how things seem superficial and disconnected.
* **It connects this emptiness to a sense of being overwhelmed by information and choices (tang madun ai hparat).**  The passage describes being bombarded with media (TV) and possibilities, leaving one feeling lost and unable to find genuine meaning.
* **The passage states this emptiness and being overwhelmed are *connected* (seng ai).** The feeling of emptiness isn't just *present*, it's *caused* by the constant flow of superficiality and choice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage *mentions* sharing, the core issue isn't simply about sharing itself, but the *nature* of what's being shared in a postmodern context.
* **B:** The passage doesn't focus on how people *react* to emptiness, but rather on the *source* of that emptiness.
* **D:** The passage does mention superficial enjoyment (jai lang byin), but it's presented as a symptom of the problem, not the defining characteristic.



Therefore, option C best encapsulates the central argument of the passage – the connection between postmodern emptiness and the overwhelming nature of modern life."
"Shawoi yup nga ai aten laman da sang rawt ngut ai hpang, lawu kaw na gara wa gaw yup gin jang ai bungli mahkrun hpe je bat na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shana yup ai ten hta jasu nsen pat na minit hkun hpang hta bai yup pyaw mat ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Tsep kawp yup rawt ai nre ai sha yu maya dum taw hkra nsen nau nja ai yup jasu nari hpe lang nna galaw mai nga ai. Lama na nang yup sharawt aten masat tawn ai rai yang, dai hpe nang na gawk kaga hkran maga hta tawn da ai lam gaw nang hpe rawt nna dai hpe wa sat na matu galaw shangun na ra ai."" This translates to focusing on moments when you feel a strong connection or inspiration (a ""feeling"" or ""sense"") and then reflecting on what you were doing when you felt that way.  It's about identifying *when* you feel inspired and what leads to it.  The passage specifies looking at those moments within a timeframe (10-60 minutes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yup ra n shang shi yang hkying hkum mi jan laika hti ai:** This doesn't relate to the passage's focus on identifying inspiring moments.
* **B: Hkashin gawk sa ngut ai hte yup ra kalang ta shang ai:** This also doesn't connect to the core idea of the passage.
* **D: Shana yup ten hta rawt nna hka bu kaw na hka lu ai:**  This speaks to general experience but isn't focused on pinpointing times of inspiration.



Therefore, option **C** best reflects the advice given in the passage about looking for times when you feel inspired and reflecting on what you were doing at that moment."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw yup gin jang lam hte seng na jaw ai hku n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw biorhythm ntsa hta npawt re (This is related to biorhythms)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""kaga biorhythm hta mahta ai lata la lam ni"" (things related to biorhythms)** and discusses how these cycles affect energy levels and decision-making (""yup pyaw na hpe madung da nna lu hpa ntsin law law"").  The entire passage revolves around understanding these cycles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi a yaw shada lam gaw tinang kaja wa nan yup hprang na matu nre (This is about things people do when they are tired and need rest)** - While the passage *touches* on energy levels, it's not primarily *about* needing rest. It's about understanding the *cycles* that cause those energy fluctuations.
* **C: Dai mabyin gaw shawoi yup ai aten hta byin pru ai lam re (This text is about problems that arise when you are distracted)** - Distraction isn't the main focus.  The focus is on internal cycles.
* **D: Rawt ngut ai hpang, yaw shada lam gaw hkying hkum hkawng laman hta bai yup pyaw mat na matu re (In general, when you're tired, you don't make good decisions in important situations)** - This is a general statement that *could* be derived from the passage, but it's not the core topic.



"
"Bawnu gaw yup mang jahkring hkring mu na matu shakut ai hte maren, hpa baw rawt jat wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: REM masa lapran na aten**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Ndai mabyin masa a madung madi madun ai lam gaw REM ginra ni lapran dan leng ai yupmang ni aten nau la wa ai mahtai a majaw re.""  This directly translates to: ""The reason why people often feel tired after waking up is because the sleep stage is REM and the brain is still active.""

The question asks what the passage says causes tiredness. The passage specifically links tiredness to activity *during* REM sleep (""lapran dan leng ai"" - still active).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: REM masa shadawn shadang** - The passage doesn't talk about *how much* REM sleep is had, just that activity *during* REM sleep is a factor.
*   **B: N-gun madang** - This doesn't appear in the passage.
*   **C: Bai kaja wa ai masa du na matu ra ai aten** - While waking up *can* interrupt sleep stages, the passage focuses on the brain activity *within* REM as the cause of tiredness.



"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai n kaja ai lam ni kaw na hkumhkrang hta yup mang law law mu ai rai yang gara n kaja ai lam ni byin wa na rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Lana mi hta REM ni law wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on REM sleep.** It discusses how dreams happen during REM, how it feels, and how it's connected to feeling rested.  The question asks what the passage talks about *when you wake up*, and the passage directly states waking up from REM sleep is associated with feeling refreshed (""...ndai mungdaw hta nang gaw teng sha yup pyaw ai ngu ai lam..."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM masa lapran na aten ladaw ni yawm mat na:** While the passage mentions REM sleep, it doesn't focus on *how* REM is measured or understood scientifically.
* **B: Lana mi hta REM ni yawm na:**  The passage doesn't solely focus on *when* REM occurs, but *what it feels like and its benefits*.
* **C: Asan sha re ai yup mang ni hta madung ai:** The passage briefly mentions distractions (like TV) but isn't primarily *about* things that interrupt sleep.



Therefore, option **D** best reflects the central theme of the passage regarding waking up feeling refreshed after REM sleep."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun dai ai hte maren, yu maya hpung ni hte virtual hpung ni gaw gara hku bung ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpung lahkawng yen gaw shani shagu na shanhte galaw ai lam ni hta tinang nan up hkang ai madang nga ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** discusses how ""invisible teams"" operate within organizations, influencing behavior and outcomes without being directly visible. It highlights how people are affected by unseen forces and relationships (""uhpung""). It emphasizes that these forces shape how people act and interact.
* **The question (Q)** asks how real and virtual environments differ in terms of influence.
* **Option B** directly addresses this by stating that the organizational environment (hpung lahkawng yen) influences people's actions (shanhte galaw ai lam) – essentially describing the impact of the ""invisible team"" mentioned in the passage.  It explains how this influence happens through subtle and often unconscious processes (""tinang nan up hkang"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  This is too general and doesn’t connect to the specific idea of influence within an organizational context.
* **C:** This focuses on ""n-mu lu ai hparan hparen lam"" (things that don't appear on the surface) but doesn’t explain *how* these unseen things affect behavior.
* **D:** This is a negative statement (doesn’t influence) and contradicts the central theme of the passage, which is about the *power* of the invisible organizational forces.



Therefore, **B** best captures the essence of the passage and answers the question accurately."
"Matsing masat gayan hta mahta nna, gara ndau ai lam gaw hkumhkrang hte seng ai hte virtual hpung ni hta n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Yu maya hpung ni gaw virtual hpung ni hta madu up hkang lam nau n nga ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** discusses how ""real"" (yu maya) teams operate and how their actions are visible. It then contrasts this with ""virtual"" teams, stating that their interactions often *lead to* (madu up hkang lam) a sense of understanding within the virtual space (virtual hpung ni hta).  The passage emphasizes how even invisible interactions contribute to team dynamics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yu maya hpung ni gaw grai tsaw ai madang hku galaw ma ai** - This states real teams don't move in a specific way, which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **B: Virtual hpung ni gaw yu maya hpung ni a matu matut mahkai ai lam langai hku galaw ya nga ai** - This implies virtual teams mimic real teams, which is not the primary point. The passage highlights the *differences* and how virtual teams function uniquely.
* **D: Shai taw ai aten ni gaw virtual hpung a matu akyu nga ai** - This talks about perspectives within the virtual space, which isn't the central idea of the relationship between real and virtual team interactions.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the core message of the passage – that interactions (even indirect ones) within a virtual team contribute to a shared understanding and functioning, mirroring the way ""real"" teams build understanding through visible actions."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw content myit sawn ai lam hku na ning pawt da ai n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Asak kaba wa ai ten hta myit marin ai lam nnan ni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai ga shawn ni gaw shinggyim masha ni gaw asak kaba wa ai hte maren ra rawng ai lam ni (sh) myit marin ai lam ni nga ai."" This translates to ""This part discusses how motivation arises from things that are lacking or unmet needs.""  This directly relates to feeling dissatisfied (asak kaba wa ai) and then being motivated to fulfill those needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Marai langai a grup yin gaw gara hku shanhte a galaw ai lam hta akyu jaw ai lam:** This talks about group dynamics and how they influence behavior, not the initial source of motivation.
* **C: Mung kata ra rawng ai lam ni:** This is too general. The passage focuses on *why* motivation arises, not just that it *does* arise.
* **D: Masha ni a ra ai lam hpe chye na ya ai:**  This refers to understanding the motivations themselves, not the fundamental starting point of content motivation.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw rule of thirds a yaw shada da ai lam nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gin hpan ni tawn na shara hta npawt gaw ai lam ni galaw ya ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P's text explains the ""rule of thirds""** and how it involves dividing an image into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines.  It then discusses how important subjects should be placed *along* these lines or at their intersections to create a visually appealing composition.
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""Gin hpan ni tawn na shara hta npawt gaw ai lam ni galaw ya ai lam"" translates to ""The way the important things are placed in the picture along the lines."" This captures the core idea of the rule of thirds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sumla langai hta asak hte n-gun hpe shalat yu u** -  Focuses on shadows and light, not the compositional rule.
* **C: Ginhpan hpe laksan hte akyu nga ai shara hta zing da u** -  Mentions focus and clarity, but doesn't relate to the rule of thirds.
* **D: Sumla langai hta lamang langai hpang yu u** - This doesn't have any relation to the explanation provided in P.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""rai tim grau ahkyak ai hku na gaw shi a ning mu htam hpe gaw ruhkum ladat lang ai kemra sumla maju hkam hkinghku lang ai lamang la-jang masa kaw na hkring htawng dagraw lai wa sai.""  This translates to something like: ""The information about how to properly calculate and use a 35mm lens, especially concerning aspect ratio, is being described.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hpe ru hkrum ladat lang ai kemra hkrang ni bau la kau sai** (This describes cameras that *use* the lens, not what the lens itself *is*). The passage is *about* the 35mm lens, not cameras.
* **C: Dai hta malawng lang mai ai hkrang hta shai ai lam ni nga ai** (This talks about details *within* the description, not the description itself).
* **D: Dai gaw mungkan hta malawng jai lang dik hkrang re** (This is too vague and doesn't capture the core message of the text – the explanation of 35mm lens calculations).

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, htuk shapraw ai ni pat a madang hpe shatsawm nna shapraw ai majaw, sumla ni hkra tsan hkra galaw ya ai jan nhpai ni gaw gara hku rawt jat wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte a sumla madang gaw ka'ang galu masat da ai pat ni zawn bung ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is struggling with a difficult task (""sumla ni hkra"").** They feel overwhelmed and unsure how to proceed. The passage specifically mentions *ka'ang galu masat da ai pat nhpai* (a difficult/complicated situation) repeatedly.
* **The question (Q) asks what contributes to this feeling of being overwhelmed.**  It's looking for the root cause of the difficulty.
* **Option C directly addresses this:**  ""Shanhte a sumla madang gaw ka'ang galu masat da ai pat ni zawn bung ai"" translates to ""Their difficulties stem from being caught up in complicated situations."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte hta lawan madang tsaw ai** (They have opposing viewpoints) -  While disagreements might exist, the passage focuses on the *difficulty* of the task, not conflict.
* **B: Dai ni hpe nhtoi nau n nga ai masa hta rai tim aloi sha lang mai ai** (What time it is on the clock that makes them think) - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.
* **D: Dai ni gaw prime pat ni hta maju jung yak ai lam yawm ai** (This is a problem related to advancing in the prime period) - This is a confusing and doesn't connect to the text.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta lawm ai lam hta mahta nna, sumla ni hkra tsan hkra galaw ya ai jan nhpai ni gaw prime pat hta galoi hkan grau kaja wa na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lama na nsin sin ai shara kemara kaprip wan n kam lang ai rai yang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on a difficult situation (""sumla ni hkra"") and a journey (""galaw ya ai jan nhpai"").** It describes facing challenges (""maren dai kaw manghkang"") and seeking help (""shapraw lu na matu"").  Crucially, it ends by mentioning ""kemara kaprip wan nlawm ai sha lang na matu yak shangun ai re"" - meaning the journey is documented with photos/videos and remembered.

* **The question (Q) asks what the prime purpose of documenting this difficult journey is.**

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nhtoi shang madang tsaw ai gaw ningshawng jaw ra ai rai yang:**  This translates to ""What was said about the upper world is a matter of belief."" It’s irrelevant to the passage.
* **B: Pat kaw na rai ni hpe shayawm mayu yang:** This translates to ""May you be successful in what you are doing.""  It’s a well-wish, but doesn’t relate to the *purpose* of documenting the journey.
* **D: Lama na nang gaw maju jung yak ai hpe tam ai rai yang:** This translates to ""Why are you holding onto the memory of facing hardships?"" It asks *why* someone remembers, not *why* they document.

**Option C directly addresses the implication of the passage's ending – the documentation of the journey through photos/videos (""kemara kaprip wan"") to preserve and share the experience.**  It suggests the documentation is for remembrance and sharing, reflecting the ""masa hta kemara kaprip wan nlawm ai sha lang na matu yak shangun ai re"" portion of the original text.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa hpe wenyi masa a teng man ai lachyum ngu na n mai sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wenyi lam hkan ai ni gaw Karai Kasang hte seng ai lam ningmu lu na matu karum ya lu ai shaman shakyang ai lam ni hpe hkap la mai ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Wenyi's connection to Karai and the suffering/struggles (shaman shakyang) associated with that connection.** The initial part describes Wenyi experiencing things related to Karai's power and the difficulties that come with it.  It mentions needing to understand (hkap la mai) these things.
* **Option C directly reflects this key element:**  It states that what Wenyi sees is related to things connected to Karai and the hardships (shaman shakyang) involved, and she needs to understand them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Simsa na myit pyaw ai masa lam hpe hkam sha lu wa hkra ahkyak shatai da ai** - This translates to something about remembering past lives, which isn't the central theme of the passage.
* **B: Wenyi masa lam hkan ai ni gaw wenyi lam hte seng ai ningmu kaja ni hpe hkan tam ma ai** - This says Wenyi sees things related to *her own* issues, but the passage focuses on things related to *Karai*.
* **D: Tinang hte seng ai mahkrum madup ni tam ai lam hta numnak bang ai gaw kaga nawku hpung hte shanhte a nawku daw jau lam hte mai shingdaw yu ai** - This option is very complex and doesn't align with the main focus of the passage. It's about dealing with difficult people and finding peace, which is not the primary topic.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it accurately captures the central idea of Wenyi's experience as described in the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw wenyi lam a maju gindai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Karai Kasang hte seng ai lam de myihtoi myit hpe tam ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Wenyi's journey to understand and overcome suffering (represented by ""galaw ai"").**  She seeks help from Karai, who is described as a source of strength (""hpung shingkang"").  The passage states she *follows* Karai and seeks to understand the meaning of life.
* **Option A directly relates to this.**  ""Karai Kasang hte seng ai lam de myihtoi myit hpe tam ai"" means ""Following the path taught by Karai Kasang, [she] seeks true understanding."" This aligns perfectly with the central theme of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Garan gachyan ai, rau hkam sha ai kaw mahkrum madup ni kaw na myithtoi lam hpe hkan u:** This talks about difficult situations and hardships, but doesn't directly address the core of *why* Wenyi seeks understanding.
* **C: Myit pyaw ai lam hpe numnak bang ai:** This means ""embracing the path of suffering,"" which isn't the central focus. Wenyi isn't *embracing* suffering, she's trying to *overcome* it.
* **D: Karai Kasang a myit ningmu hpe hkan tam ai:** This talks about seeking Karai's blessings, but isn't the core motivation for Wenyi’s journey – it’s the *understanding* she seeks.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hkai nmai hte seng ai uhpung hpe kadai hpang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Chatham Zinglawng ni kaw na Moriori**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Moriori ni gaw New Zealand kaw na Chatham zinglawng de bu htawt lai wa ai kanu mungdan Maori hpung ni re.""  This translates to ""Moriori settled on the Chatham Islands of New Zealand...""

The question asks who settled and became the inhabitants of a place. The passage specifically identifies the Moriori as settling on the Chatham Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: New Zealand kaw na Moriori** - While they eventually *were* in New Zealand, the passage states they came *from* somewhere else (Chatham Islands) to be there.
* **C: Polynesia kaw na Maori masha ni** - The passage discusses the Maori's origins in Polynesia, but not as the settlers being asked about.
* **D: Mainland kaw na Maori** - The passage focuses on the Moriori and their settlement location, not the Maori's mainland presence.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, moas hpe gyam ai hpung ni gaw gara shara a shawngnan shanu ai ni rai?","The correct answer is **C: Chatham Zinglawng ni** (Chatham Islands).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Moriori ni gaw New Zealand kaw na Chatham zinglawng de bu htawt lai wa ai kanu mungdan Maori hpung ni re.""  This translates to ""The Moriori were a people who settled on the Chatham Islands, separate from the Maori people of New Zealand.""  The question asks where the people mentioned in the passage (Moriori) settled, and the text clearly identifies the Chatham Islands as their settlement.



"
Origami a Pureland ladat hpe lang ai lam hta kapum hkang ai ni hpe gara kaw akyu jaw na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kapum hkang ai wa gaw shuk ai kapum hkang ni lawm ai origami hpe hpan ai** (The person who is skilled is able to fold the origami that is skillfully folded).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** describes someone (John Smith) who was *good at* folding origami – specifically, the kind that was already skillfully made.  He wasn't *creating* complex designs, but replicating/folding existing beautiful origami.
* **Option C** directly reflects this: being skilled enough to fold *already skillful* origami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  ""Kalang ta kapum hkang law law hpe galaw na ra sharawng ai"" - This is too broad. It just says someone can show off good folding, but doesn't explain *why* they're skilled.
* **B:** ""Kapum hkang ai wa kaw madang tsaw ai motor skill nga ai"" - While good motor skills are *necessary* for origami, the passage doesn't focus on the skills themselves, but on the ability to replicate skillful work.
* **D:** ""Kapum hkang ai wa gaw shawng de kalang (sh) lahkawng lang sha galaw ga ai"" - This talks about folding from a design, which isn't what the passage describes.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Pureland origami hte seng na n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw mahkrum madup n nga ai kapum hkang ai ni hpe yaw shada ai** (This is about describing the difficulties of a complex craft).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes Pureland origami as difficult (""masat da ai"") and requiring skill (""ripkawp ni lawm ai"").**  John Smith's story illustrates this – he spent time *learning* it (""gin shalat da ai"").
* **Option A** directly reflects this idea – it's about a complex craft and *describing* its challenges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hta nhtang kapum hkang ladat n lawm ai** (This is about many crafts being easy) - The passage focuses on the *difficulty* of this specific origami.
* **C: Kapum hkang ni hta loi ai shara ni sha mai lawm ai** (This is about the rules of the craft) - The passage doesn't mention rules, just the skill required.
* **D: Dai gaw motor skill nau n nga ai kapum hkang ai ni a matu kaja ai mahkrun re** (This is about a craft that heavily relies on motor skills) - While origami *does* require motor skills, the passage isn't primarily *about* that aspect. It's about the overall challenge and dedication it takes to learn.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara shara gaw Indus Valley Civilization lam hte nseng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...masha ni Harappa hpe yu nna Harappan shinggyim gan ga lai wa sai shara ngu shaga ma tim..."" which translates to ""...and named it Harappa, thus the Harappan civilization began...""  This directly links Harappa to the beginning/naming of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sarasvati Hka nu:** While the passage mentions the Sarasvati River, it's discussed in relation to the civilization's potential decline or location changes, not its origin.
* **C: Dingdung Afghanistan hta nga ai rapdaw ni yawng:** The passage mentions Afghanistan as part of the civilization's geographical spread, but doesn't state it's where the civilization originated.
* **D: Prat dep Pakistan malawng:** Pakistan is where the civilization *was found*, but the passage doesn't identify it as the origin point.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Magri Prat shinggyim gan ga lam a mai byin ai mying hpe matsing masat ga yan hta n madun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Indus-Sarasvati shinggyim gan ga lam**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...grau na htap htuk hkra Indus-Sarasvativ masha nga pra rawt majan lai wa sai shara ngu shaga na hku tak maram yu ai raitim..."" This translates to ""...researchers named it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization because of the discoveries made...""  Therefore, the passage identifies the civilization as the Indus-Sarasvati civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Harappan shinggyim gan ga lam** - While Harappa is a key city within the civilization, the passage refers to a broader civilization encompassing more than just Harappa.
* **C: Indus River hka mayan kaw na shinggyim gan ga lam** - The Indus River is important, but the civilization is named for *both* the Indus and Sarasvati rivers.
* **D: Indus Valley shinggyim gan ga lam** - While a common name, the passage specifically highlights the importance of the Sarasvati River and names it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw ladaw galu akyu kaja hpejaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Kaga ni hte pawng ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes a situation where someone is experiencing hardship (""masha law malawng"") and feeling overwhelmed.  It highlights the importance of helping those in need (""galoi mung anhte"") and the power of compassion (""shingra maka hte seng nna myit hpawm""). The last part emphasizes that simply *understanding* hardship isn't enough; we need to *do* something about it (""shanhte a aten galu kaja dik lata la mai ai gaw kaga ni""). This translates to needing to actively *help* or *assist*.

* **Q's question** asks what someone should do when facing difficulty and seeking help.

* **Option A (""Kaga ni hte pawng ai lam"" - The way to help and assist)** directly aligns with the core message of P's text. It's the most fitting response, suggesting offering practical assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dinghkrai myit shang sha lam hpe madung dat ai (The way to understand the difficulties of others)** - While understanding is good, P's text stresses *action* beyond understanding.
* **C: Law ai hta n law ai hpe akyu jaw ai lam hpe numnak bang ai lam (The way to meticulously explain what is right and wrong)** - This is about moral lecturing, which isn't the focus of P's message.
* **D: Law hpa ai myit gaw akyu mai byin ai lam hpe matsing sumhting ai lam (The way to remember what hardships are like)** -  Again, this focuses on remembering, not *doing* something to alleviate suffering.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer as it reflects the practical and compassionate message of the original text."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, lama marai langai ngai gaw ya jang lu ai amyat hta maju jung da ai rai yang, lawu kaw na gara hpe ningshawng jaw masat na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tinggyeng myit n rawng ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is primarily discussing ""tinggyeng myit"" (things/matters/issues).** It talks about how these things come about, how they are dealt with, and the consequences. The entire focus is on understanding *tinggyeng myit*.
* **Question (Q) asks what the passage is *about*.**  It's asking for the central topic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masha ni hte arau galaw ai (Things that happen and are resolved):** While the passage *mentions* resolution, it's not the core subject. It's about the nature of the problems themselves.
* **C: Myit hpawn galaw ai lam (The way things are handled):** This is a *part* of the passage, but not the overall theme.  The passage explores *why* things happen and *what* they are, *then* touches on how they're handled.
* **D: Tinggyeng myit (Things/Matters/Issues):** While correct in identifying a key term, it doesn't answer the question of what the passage is *about*.  ""Tinggyeng myit n rawng ai"" (about things/matters/issues) is a more complete and accurate answer to what the passage discusses.



Therefore, **A** best captures the main subject of the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, majan poi hta ma mat ai gumhpraw ni a matu kadai jaw ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Wall Street gumhpraw dum ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shanhte gaw Wall Street gumhpraw dum nta ni kaw na Philippine asuya a mying hte amyet hte jai lang ai ni a law malawng hpe jaw bang ya na matu U.S mung maden uphkang lai len de ahkun jaw na matu shanhte hpe shagyeng hpyi ma ai.""  This translates to: ""They (shanhte - likely referring to investors/economic actors) are causing problems for the Philippine economy because of Wall Street practices and the impact they have, leading to the U.S. benefiting...""

The question asks what is causing problems and difficulties. The passage *directly* identifies Wall Street practices as the source of these issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Philippine mung up asuya** - While the Philippines is affected, it's not the *cause* of the problems.
*   **C: U.S koloni up hkang asuya** - The passage mentions the U.S. *benefiting* from the situation, not being a cause of difficulty. The history of colonization isn't the focus of this part of the text.
*   **D: Filipino masha ni** - The passage describes the difficulties *experienced* by Filipino people, but the *cause* isn't Filipino people themselves.



"
Templars prat n re shi ai shaloi gara prat shawng sa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hpang na ka-ang prat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shawng na ka-ang prat ni gaw lahta ka-ang prat ni hta shawng du ai re nna matut manoi gaw hpang na ka-ang prat bai du wa nna shi a htung lai ni gaw 1500 grup yin daram hta hkring mat sai re.""  This directly translates to ""The second order was duplicated in the first order and the majority was found in the founding order, and the number of groups was approximately 1500.""  Therefore, the founding order (hpang na ka-ang prat) is where they originated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tsaban 12th** - While the passage mentions the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, it doesn't say the Templars *started* in the 12th century.
*   **C: Shawng na ka-ang prat** - This is the second order, duplicated *from* the first.
*   **D: Tsaban 13th** - Similar to the 12th century, the passage mentions this time period but not as the origin.



"
Templars prat ngut ai hpang gara prat bai sa wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hpang na ka-ang prat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...shi a htung lai ni gaw 1500 grup yin daram hta hkring mat sai re."" which translates to ""...their organization grew to around 1500 groups.""  This directly refers to the *hpang na ka-ang prat* (organizations/groups) growing in size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsaban 12th:** The 12th century is mentioned as part of the timeframe (11th, 12th, 13th centuries) but doesn't represent what the Templars *grew* into.
* **C: Lahta ka-ang prat:**  This refers to the later organizations, after the initial ones.
* **D: Tsaban 11th:** Similar to option B, the 11th century is a timeframe, not the result of growth.



"
Roma Hkaw Seng ten laman na ga lajang ai ni shing nrai tsi du ni hku na gara tsi tsi lajang ai lam shing nrai ladat ni hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myit ana hkam sha ai ni hpe myit zim tsi jaw nna tsi tsi ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Augustus (the Roman emperor) was known for using poisons (morphine and scopolamine) to eliminate rivals.  The question asks about what he did, and option A directly reflects this - using poisons to secretly kill people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Scopolamine a matu tsi tum ni a machyan hpe jai lang ai** - While scopolamine *was* used, the passage doesn't focus on understanding its effects, just that it was *part of* the poison.
* **C: Sai pat ai ni hpe yen nna lu hkawm hkra galaw ai** - This refers to the Shan people and is irrelevant to the question about the Roman emperor.
* **D: Hkum kaw sai nhkawm ai ana hkam sha ai masha ni hpe hkum di kau na tsi lajang ai lam** - This also relates to the Shan people and isn’t about Augustus’ actions.

The passage specifically states: "" Hkawseng magam Augustus gaw tsi du ni hpe lahkawn hpang nna majang ngut ai hpang matut jai lang na matu shawng na Roma Tsi Hpung hpe mung hpaw ninghtan da ai.""  This directly translates to ""Roman emperor Augustus was interested in poisons and used them to eliminate rivals and strengthen the Roman Empire.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsi hte seng ai uhpung ni hpaw hpang wa ai lam:** (The way poisons were used) - While the passage *mentions* poisons, it doesn't focus on *how* they were used in detail.
* **B: Hkaw Seng mungdan kata grai sawng ai hpyen dap ladat:** (The reasons the Roman Empire fell) - The passage doesn't discuss the fall of the Roman Empire.
* **C: Tsi hte seng ai hpe sharin ya ai tsi rung ni hpaw ai:** (The types of poisons used) - The passage only mentions morphine and scopolamine as examples, but doesn’t detail various types of poisons.



"
Mu lu ai atsam gaw gara ntsa shamyet shanat nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myi hte mai mu lu ai hkum daw shan ni**.

Here's why:

The passage starts with: ""Mu ai lam (sh) mu lu ai atsam gaw myit hte mai mu lu ai hkum daw shan ni hta mahta ai."" This directly translates to ""The reason why people study is because they want to be educated/knowledgeable.""  The question asks *why* people study.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hkrung kanu a ra rawng ai lam:** This refers to opportunities opening up, a *result* of studying, not the reason *for* studying.
* **C: Nkau shadawn shadang ni hpe maju jung lu ai:** This talks about mastering skills, also a result.
* **D: Sung de lang ai nbung ai degree ni:** This refers to obtaining a degree, again a result of studying.



"
Asak hkrung kanu ni shai ai myi amyu myu hkrang ni gaw hpa lam hta shamyet taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Asak hkrung kanu ni a matu ra rawng ai lam ni** (The reason why the future is bright).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the importance of education.** It talks about how education can lead to a better life, overcoming difficulties, and achieving success.  The key point is that even though someone starts with nothing, education can open doors.
* **The question (Q) asks about what makes the future bright.**  The passage clearly implies that education (""asak hkrung kanu"" - future) is the key to a positive future.  ""A matu ra rawng ai lam ni"" (the reason why it is bright) directly relates to this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsan shadang ni hpe hkam sha lu ai** (Things that should be avoided) -  The passage doesn't focus on what to avoid, but on what to *pursue*.
* **C: Myit maju jung lu ai madang** (The time to work hard) - While hard work is implied, the passage centers on *how* to work towards a better future (through education).
* **D: Asak hkrung kanu ni a shuk ai lam** (The difficulties of the future) - The passage acknowledges difficulties but focuses on how education helps overcome them.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the meaning of the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sikhs htung hte seng na gara ndau ai lam gaw nawku hpung hte seng na jaw hkra nlu hkrang shala ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sikhs htung gaw Hindu htung hking lapran garan wa ai hpung re.**

* **The passage states:** ""Sikhs htung gaw Kala dan daw na makam masham langai re. Dai gaw tsa ban 15th laman Hindu htung hking kata uhpung garan mat ai kaw na Punjab ginra kaw na madung pru wa ai.""  This translates to ""The Sikh religion originated later and arose as a reform of the 15th-century Hindu religion in the Punjab region.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hpung sara gaw Sikhs htung a npawt madung re:** The passage doesn't state that religion *completely* belongs to the Sikhs. It says it *originated* from Hinduism.
* **C: Guru Nanak nawku hpung hpe mu tam la ai hpang hpung sara marai jahku hkan nang wa ai:** While Guru Nanak is important, the passage doesn't say his founding *caused* the religion to greatly expand.
* **D: Sikhs htung a htung tara nkau ni gaw Hindu ni kaw npawt hpang da ai:**  The passage focuses on the origin *from* Hinduism, not a complete separation.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na Sikh makam ladat a alak mi re ai lam ngu gara wa hpe mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpung sara ni a ningmu** (The essence of their faith).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on defining what Sikhs believe and practice – their faith.** It explains their origins from Hinduism, their unique beliefs (Gurmat), and how their faith differs from both Hinduism and general Indian culture.  The question asks for what *defines* Sikhism.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Hindu ni a htung tara** (Origin from Hinduism) - While the passage *mentions* their Hindu origins, it's not the defining characteristic. It explains how they diverged.
    * **C: Kaga India nawku hpung ni hpe ninghkap ai** (Representing Indian culture) - The passage actually points out how Sikh culture is *distinct* from general Indian culture.
    * **D: Punjabi aga hpe shaga ai** (Speaking the Punjabi language) -  While Punjabi is important to Sikh culture, language isn’t the core defining element of their faith.



Therefore, understanding the core beliefs and practices (their *hpung sara ni*) is what the passage primarily conveys, making option A the most accurate answer."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Attention Deficit Disorder hkam sha taw nga ai ma gaw gara hta maju jung na matu yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Ginsup hpan ginsup ai hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ADD rau re ai ma ni gaw jawng laika zawn re ai arai ni kaw myit maju jung na matu yak hkak ai aten ni nga ai rai timung shanhte gaw **ginsup hpan ginsup ai lam shanhte a ra dik ai cartoon sumla hkrung ni yu ai lam ga hkring**...""

This directly links the difficulties with ADD to being distracted by things like cartoons and appealing visuals – things that are ""ginsup hpan ginsup"" (bright and flashy).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jawng bungli** - While the passage mentions difficulties with focus, it doesn't specifically say ADD causes clumsiness.
*   **C: Cartoon sumla yu ai ten** - This is *part* of the explanation, but not the overarching reason. The passage states cartoons *cause* distraction, not that they *are* the reason for ADD.
*   **D: Shanhte galaw pyaw ai rai ni** - This refers to difficulties with tasks, a symptom, not the underlying cause of distraction.

"Matsing masat ga ya hta tsun da ai hte maren, Attention Deficit Disorder hkam sha taw nga ai ma ni gaw hpa majaw dingbai dingna byin chye ai akyang ni hpe galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte na kanu kawa ni kaw na maju jung ai lam ra ai majaw**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) manifests in children, often appearing as difficulty concentrating, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. It mentions that ADD affects a small percentage of children (3-5% generally, 2% in America) and how it can *look like* the child isn't trying hard enough or is deliberately misbehaving (""shanhte na kanu kawa ni kaw na maju jung ai lam ra ai majaw""). The passage highlights the frustration of parents who believe their children *could* do better if they simply *tried*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shajan shalai masa hpe shayawm lu na matu:** The passage mentions difficulties with attention, but doesn't focus on problems with remembering past events (""shajan shalai masa"").
*   **B: Manang ni hte matut mahkai chye na matu shanhte hpe karum ya ai:** The passage doesn't specifically focus on sadness or making children feel bad.
*   **D: Shanhte a bawnu hpe jasu ya na matu:** While the passage touches on parental frustration, it isn't primarily about punishing children.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw scaffolding a ga shadawn nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Kompyuta ginsup hpan a shawng nnan hta ladat sharin ya ai lamang** (Learning to share data on a computer).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly discusses scaffolding in the context of learning.** It describes how scaffolding supports learning, especially in computer skills and complex tasks.  It explains how it provides temporary support that is gradually removed as the learner gains proficiency.
* **The passage uses the example of Microsoft Office and the paperclip man (Clippy)** to illustrate how scaffolding can appear in familiar software.  This directly relates to learning how to use computer programs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: SAT sharin ya ai wa (Sharing SAT results)** - The passage doesn't mention SAT or test results.
* **C: Wanglu wanglang hkaja mai ai lamang (Networking)** - While computers are involved, the passage isn't about networking specifically. It's about *learning* with computer assistance.
* **D: Ginsup hpung kaji a sara (The basis of learning)** - This is too broad. The passage focuses on a *specific type* of support *within* learning - scaffolding.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw scaffolding hte seng na n jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dai gaw sharin hkam la ai ladat hta madi shadaw ya ai lam re.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Scaffolding gaw sharin hkam la ai ladat langai gaw nre tim..."" (Scaffolding is something that helps with the learning process).  This directly corresponds to option B – it explains that scaffolding helps in the process of learning/understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Scaffold ni gaw ganghkau hta mung mai nga ai** – The passage doesn't say scaffolding *isn't* helpful.
* **C: Dai hpe lamang nnan sharin hkam la ai lam ngu mung tsun ai** – The passage doesn't focus on *knowing* it helps, but rather *how* it helps.
* **D: Scaffold ni gaw sharin hkam la ai mahkrum madup a matu shawng daw hta madi shadaw ya ai** – While the passage mentions scaffolding helps with complex tasks, this option is too specific and doesn't capture the overall idea.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara MySpace lam gaw laika hti yak ai ma ni a matu akyu nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Web shara langai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes MySpace as a website where people could share things like blogs, photos, and music – essentially, a platform for sharing content online. The phrase ""internet sharin laika man zawn re ndai website ni"" directly translates to ""this website was a platform for internet sharing.""  The passage then contrasts this with modern social media, highlighting how MySpace allowed for a broader range of sharing than what is common today.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Myit ra ai hku galaw ai (What was said)** - While the passage *is* saying something *about* MySpace, the question asks what specifically made MySpace important.
* **B: Blog ni (Blogs)** - Blogs were *part* of MySpace, but not its defining feature.  The passage lists blogs alongside other things shared.
* **D: Masha wan 54 a prat labau (54 year olds practice)** - This refers to a specific demographic mentioned, but doesn't describe the core function of the website.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Krushchev a bungli galaw masha kasu kabrawng ai lam ni n’tsa tai ai lam nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkringmang daju nnan hpe lit jaw da ai** (He allowed Wladyslaw Gomulka to take power).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sut masa hte seng ai hpyi shawn lam ni hpe jaw ya nna, mying kaba nga ai Wladyslaw Gomulka hpe mung hkringmang daju nnan hku lit ap ya na matu hkap la sai."" This directly translates to ""Instead of suppressing it, he allowed Wladyslaw Gomulka, a popular figure, to come to power.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aming hpe bai lu na matu hpri gang mawdaw ni hpe jai lang ai** (He justified the tanks being sent) - The passage doesn't support this. It describes *why* he allowed Gomulka to take power, not justifying sending tanks.
* **C: Shata shabrai di la hpe shatsaw ai** (He revealed the secrets of the past) - While the events were a result of past issues, the passage doesn't say Krushchev *revealed* secrets.
* **D: Sut masa lam hta ra rawng ai n kau ni hpe masat ya ai lam galaw ai** (He acted on the issues of the past) - This is too vague. The *specific* action was allowing Gomulka to take power.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Poland kata na rawt malan lam a majaw byin ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kummyunit ladat**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the events described were about challenging the Communist system (""Kummyunit lailen hpe ninghkap ai de gale wa ai ten"").  Krushchev's actions in Poland were related to dealing with movements against Communist rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lusha kadawn ai** - While there was unrest, the core issue wasn't just general chaos, but a challenge to the political system.
* **C: Shabrai di la ai** -  The passage mentions shabrai (difficulties) but doesn't identify this as the central theme.
* **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka hte hkrum zup ai lam** - Gomulka is *a result* of the events, not the overarching reason *for* them. The passage states he was brought to power *because* of what was happening.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw USA hte USSR lapran hku hkau ai lam hpe hkra machyi ai lam n’nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Htunghking hte seng ai lam shai ai** (Things related to war and the suffering caused by it).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the Cold War conflict between the USA and USSR.** It describes proxy wars fought in various regions (Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba) as a result of this conflict.  These wars brought destruction, suffering, and hardship.
* **The question asks about the central theme of the passage.** The passage isn't *about* Germany being divided (B), simply listing events (C), or land disputes (D). It's fundamentally about the consequences of the USA and USSR's rivalry – the wars and the resulting suffering.

Therefore, option A best summarizes the core message of the text.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw hkumhkrang chyam hkra a-kajawng sha byin wa ai nerve ni hpe sa ya ai lam a yaw shada lam hpe teng ai hku n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Homeostasis hpe mazing ya ai** (Strengthens homeostasis).

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** explicitly states the nervous system works to maintain homeostasis. It describes how nerves receive and transmit information to regulate bodily functions and maintain a stable internal environment.
* **The Question (Q)** asks about what the nervous system does with the information it receives from nerves.
* **Option C** directly reflects the function described in the passage - the nervous system *strengthens* or *maintains* homeostasis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sai lwi ai hpe lanyen hkun ai** (Reduces pain) - While the nervous system *can* play a role in pain management, it's not its primary function described in the passage.
* **B: Sai lwi ai hpe hparan ya ai** (Increases pain) - The passage doesn't indicate the nervous system increases pain.
* **D: Hkumhkrang hta byin mai ai shoihpa ni koi ya ai** (Causes problems in the body) -  The nervous system is meant to *prevent* problems, not cause them, by regulating body functions.



"
Giza Plateau hta hpa hpe mu mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa Pyramid**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states:  ""Egutu a Si ai hkaraw a shingnip hta na Giza Plateau (sh) """"""""Giza Necropolis"""""""" hta jut sen lupwa (pyramid) (dai shara na jut sen lupwa gaw kaba dik), lupwa kasha, nawku htingnu hte hkik hkam ai Sphinx ni law law nga ai.""  This directly says that pyramids (jut sen lupwa) are what you find on the Giza Plateau.  Specifically, it mentions the *Great* Pyramid (Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa Pyramid).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lupwa ni** - While pyramids *are* on the plateau, this is too general.
*   **B: Nawku jawng ni** - The passage mentions tombs (nawku htingnu) but doesn't state they are the primary thing *on* the plateau.
*   **C: Mau hpa lam sanit** -  The passage mentions the pyramids were built as tombs, but doesn't say that's what you *see* when you look at Giza Plateau.



"
Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa Pyramid ni a yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Pharaoh hpe chye hkungga na matu** (Built to honor the Pharaoh).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa (pyramid) gaw Hparaoh Khufu hpe hkungga shagrau ai hku na gaw gap da ai re..."" (The Great Pyramid was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu...) and ""...jut sen lupwa kaji ni, lupwa ni, nawku htingnu ni hpe gaw Khufu a madu jan ni, dinghku masha ni hpe hkungga shagrau ai hku na gaw shachyaw da ai re."" (The pyramid, and the associated temple and causeway were built by Khufu's sons to honor his memory).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mungkan a mau hpa sanit byin wa na matu** (It's not clear why it was built) - The passage clearly states *who* it was built for.
* **C: Labau numdaw tai na matu** (To observe the stars) - The passage doesn't mention astronomical purposes.
* **D: Si mat ai masha ni a lup hpe bang tawn da na matu** (To protect the remains of the dead) - While protecting remains *is* a function of a tomb, the primary purpose stated is honoring the Pharaoh.



"
Nawku jawng ni hpe wan nat nna jahten chye ai anhte a hparat hte seng na kadai kaw lit nga ai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ephesians**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ephesians gaw maroi nni ai hte Herostratus ngu ai mying hpe galoi nna yu ai nga ndau dat ai."" This translates to ""The Ephesians were blamed and punished by the people because of Herostratus.""  Therefore, the Ephesians are the ones who were blamed for the destruction of the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alexander the Great:** While the passage mentions Alexander, he wasn't blamed for destroying the temple; he *visited* it.
* **C: Strabo:** Strabo was a historian who *recorded* information about the temple, he didn't destroy it or get blamed for it.
* **D: Artemis:** Artemis is the goddess the temple was dedicated to; she wasn't responsible for its destruction.



"
Armetis nawku jawng bai gawgap ai hte seng na gara wa gaw jaw ai ndau ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Alexander the Great hku na bai gawgap na matu gumhpraw shaw ya ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Alexander gaw hkawhkam langai hku na nawku htingnu gaw gap na ga gumhpraw jaw na matu tsun ai raitimung shi tsun ai ni hpe ningdang kau ya ma ai."" This translates to ""Alexander didn't want his name associated with the rebuilding of the temple, so he refused to contribute to it.""  Later it says, ""Alexander si mat ai hpang, shaning 323 BCE kaw nawku htingnu hpe bai gaw gap lai wa sai re,"" meaning the temple rebuilding began after Alexander's death in 323 BCE.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention Alexander *intentionally* causing the temple to fall. He simply refused to help rebuild it.
* **C:** Herostratus destroyed the temple, but the passage focuses on *why* the rebuilding was delayed, and that's linked to Alexander.
* **D:** While the date is mentioned, it doesn't explain *why* the rebuilding happened then. It's a consequence of Alexander's death, not the reason itself.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, lagaw lahkawng hte lu hkawm wa ai jau dik ten gaw galoi rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lai wa sai wan lahkawng ning hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Lai wa sai wan sanit ning jau daw de na Sahelanthropus ni gaw lagaw lahkawng hte hkawm lai wa sa na re timung lagaw lahkawng hte seng ai mu nu ni gaw Austalopithecus namhkan lung ni hpe lai wa sai wan 4.2-3.9 ning kaw na nga lai wa sai lam sawk tam lu ma ai.""

This translates to: ""...Sahelanthropus, who lived around the time of the earliest hominins, and the oldest fossils found are from the Australopithecus lineage, dating back 4.2-3.9 million years.""

The question asks about *when* they began to walk upright. The passage directly links the earliest upright walking to around 4.2-3.9 million years ago, specifically mentioning it in relation to Sahelanthropus and Australopithecus.  ""Lahkawng ning"" means ""million years.""  Therefore, the answer referring to ""lahkawng ning"" is the most accurate.



"
Ndai kaw na gara baw hpan ni gaw lagaw lahkawng hte hkawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Sahelanthropus ni gaw lagaw lahkawng hte hkawm lai wa sa na re timung lagaw lahkawng hte seng ai mu nu ni gaw Austalopithecus namhkan lung ni hpe lai wa sai wan 4.2-3.9 ning kaw na nga lai wa sai lam sawk tam lu ma ai.""  This directly translates to: ""...Sahelanthropus is said to be related to the jaw, and the jaw that is similar to the Australopithecus jaw is about 4.2-3.9 million years old.""  

Therefore, Sahelanthropus is identified as being related to the jaw in question.



"
Germany hka dap ni WWII hta shangut la mayu ai lam gaw hpa baw rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain ni hpe masha hte arai ni lu la na lam hpe pat shingdang ya ai** (They actively tried to defeat Britain with weapons and armies).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""German hka dap gaw, dai aten kaw sha, Yu-hkali ni hpe malawng jai lang nna ndai lam matsut ai lam hpe hparan kau na shakut wa ma ai. Lama gasat ai kaw sum wa yang, Germany ni gaw Europe yang hte Britain hpe ganoi awng da wa na re.""  This translates to: ""The German side, in particular, constantly attempted to destroy the UK with air power and land forces. Ultimately, Germany aimed to conquer Europe and defeat Britain.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Britain kaw na shang ai arai ni hpe lapran kaw na kashun la mayu ai** (They actively tried to defeat the armies Britain sent) - The passage doesn't focus on countering British armies, but on defeating Britain itself.
* **C: Atlantic shara shagu hta rai ni htawda mayu ai** (They fought battles on the Atlantic ocean) - While the Atlantic is mentioned in the context of American aid, the main goal isn't battles *on* the Atlantic.
* **D: Amerikan ni hpe masha hte arai ni lu la na lam hpe pat shingdang ai** (They actively tried to defeat America with weapons and armies) - The passage states America *helped* Britain, not that Germany targeted America initially.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, Dingdung Atlantic arau pawng gasat ai lam hta kadai gaw hka dap gasat ai lam hta grau awngdang ai lam lu la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: British hte Amerikan ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matsing da ging ai ga shadawn ni kaw na langai gaw Mungkan Majan II shaloi na Dingdung Atlantic arau pawng gasat poi rai nga ai. Amerikan ni gaw Inglik ni hpe karum na matu hpyen ma ni hte arung arai ni hpe Atlantic panglai nda tang hpai sit ma ai.""  This translates to: ""The nations that suffered greatly and were displaced were during World War II to the Dingdung Atlantic region. The Americans helped the British with supplies and weapons across the Atlantic.""

Therefore, both the British and Americans were involved in the events related to the Atlantic crossing mentioned in the passage.



"
Assyrian ni gumra dap galaw hpang ai shaloi hpa n nga shi ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gumra hking ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gumra hking hpe gin shalat ai lam rai nnga shi ai."" which translates to ""It is said that the way they worshipped idols was important.""  The question asks what the Assyrians valued regarding their religious practices.  Worshipping idols (gumra hking) is the direct answer provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndan ni (Land):** While the passage mentions land, it doesn't say they *valued* it specifically in a religious context.
* **C: Hpyen leng ni (Sacred words/scriptures):** The passage doesn't focus on sacred words or scriptures.
* **D: N-gang palawng (Offerings):**  The passage mentions offerings (""pala ni""), but doesn't state they were the *primary* thing valued in their religious practices.



"
Majan gasat ai hta gumra dap ni hpe gara hku lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gumra shingma** (Gumra strength/power).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai majaw Assyrian gumra dap ni gaw gumra ntsa hpa nlawm ai dai hku dung nna gasat ma ai.""  This translates to ""Therefore, Assyrian gumra power was not extinguished because of gumra strength.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the continued existence (not being extinguished) of Assyrian power to its own inherent strength.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lagaw hte (War and)** - While Assyria was a war-like people, the passage doesn't say war is what sustained their power.
*   **B: N-gang palawng n lawm ai sha (Things that are not easily broken)** - This is a general characteristic, but not the *specific* reason given in the text.
*   **D: Hpyen la n law ai sha (Things that are good)** - The passage doesn't focus on ""goodness"" as the sustaining factor.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Babulun masha ni hpe nang gara kaw n lu tam ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Nawku jawng wang de wan nat hkungga la sa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nawku jawng shagu gaw kaba ai nawku jawng wang langai mi lu ma ai rai nna dai hpang gaw hkin jawng ni sha mai shang ai kata de na chyoi pra ai shara langai mung lu ma ai."" This translates to something like: ""The building style was beautiful, and the roof/top was designed to be seen from a distance, making it a wonder to behold."" This directly links the beauty and recognition to the *nawku jawng wang* (the roof/top/upper part of the structure).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nawku jawng ni hta poi sa ai** -  The passage mentions something *on* the roof, but doesn't say the roof *is* something.
* **C: Nawku jawng wang hta galaw ai poi** - This is a misinterpretation; the passage doesn’t focus on something *moving* on the roof.
* **D: Chyoi pra ai shara de wan nat hkungga la sa ai** - While the passage mentions something ""wonderful to behold,"" it specifically connects that wonder to the *nawku jawng wang*, not just any wonderful thing.



Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the passage's claim about what made the Tower of Babylon famous."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw hkin jawng ni a matu alak mi yaw shada da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Poi shingra ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai hpe dum sa ni gaw **poi shingra**, poi lamang ni hta dai hpara ni ra kadawn ai lam ni hpe la sa ya shajang ma ai.""  This translates to ""...this is because **poi shingra** (something related to offerings/gifts), the practice of giving offerings/gifts to the spirits, is not understood.""

The question asks what the passage says is *not* understood. The passage explicitly states that *poi shingra* is not understood.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Poi lamang ni:** The passage mentions *poi lamang* but doesn't say it's not understood, only that it's *related* to the practice that isn't understood.
*   **B: Myit kata chyoi pra ai lam:** This refers to practices relating to ancestor worship, which isn't specifically identified as *not understood* in the passage.
*   **D: Hkin chyang langchyi ni:** This refers to the shape of ziggurats/pyramids, and while it's discussed, the passage doesn't say understanding their shape is the issue.



"
Hkawhkam Tutankhamun gaw mying gumhkawng lam galoi lu la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi a lup damya hkrum ai shaloi** (He was famous after his tomb was discovered).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""1922 hta shi a lup hpe mu sawk tam ai gaw shi hpe masha law law hpe chye wa shangun ai."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 is what made him world famous.)  This directly links his fame to the finding of his tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi mung up ai ten** (He was just a young king) - While true, the passage doesn't focus on *why* he's remembered, only *how* he became famous.
* **C: Shi a lup bai mu tam la ai shaloi** (His tomb was never found) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **D: Moi na hkawhkam ni a mying hpe tsun dan ngut ai hpang** (Because he was a pharaoh and protected his name) - While being a pharaoh contributed to his historical significance, the passage highlights the tomb discovery as the primary reason for his widespread fame.



"
Hkawhkam Tutankhamun hpe Egypt ni a mying gumhkawng ai hkawhkam byin hkra hpa mabyin galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dingbai dingna n nga ai shi a lup hpe mu tam la ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lup law law hpe lagu la nga ai laman ndai lup gaw dingbai dingna nnga ai sha ngam taw nga ai."" (The countless treasures found in his tomb were incredibly valuable and famous.) This directly answers the question of *why* Tutankhamun became famous – it was because of the discovery of his tomb and the treasures within.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moi na hkawhkam ni a jahpan hta nga ai shi a sat lawat a majaw:**  The passage mentions his youth but doesn't focus on his life *during* his reign as a reason for fame.
* **C: Shi a lup kaw na moi na arung arai hkying hku damya hkrum ai shaloi:** While the treasures *are* impressive, the passage focuses on their discovery being the key to his fame, not just their inherent beauty.
* **D: Moi na Egypt prat hta na shi a lak lai ai lam:** The passage doesn't specifically discuss his place in Egyptian history or his legacy beyond the discovery of his tomb.



"
Greek ga shagawp ka sara Homer gaw hpa hpe n lu di ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Mu ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai ni kaw na chye dik masha gaw Homer, Greek laili laika hta reng dik ai ga shagawp lahkawng: Iliad hte Odyssey hpe shagawp da ai mying gumhkawng ai myi nmu ga shagawp sara re.""  This translates to: ""Among these famous authors, Homer is the one who wrote the famous works Iliad and Odyssey.""  Therefore, Homer *did* write these works.

* **A: Na ai (No)** - Incorrect, as the passage confirms he wrote them.
* **C: Lam hkawm ai (Related to)** - Incorrect, he *authored* them.
* **D: Ga shaga ai (Was told)** - Incorrect, he *wrote* them.



"
Mying gumhkawng ai gara Greek masha gaw laili laika hta nre sha gara kaw grau mying gumhkawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Homer**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ndai ni kaw na chye dik masha gaw Homer, Greek laili laika hta reng dik ai ga shagawp lahkawng: Iliad hte Odyssey hpe shagawp da ai mying gumhkawng ai myi nmu ga shagawp sara re.""  This translates to: ""...the most famous author is Homer, who wrote the famous works Iliad and Odyssey, a prominent author in Greek history.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sophocle ni:** The passage mentions Sophocles as *another* prominent author, but doesn't state he's the *most* famous.
*   **C: Pythagorus:** Pythagoras is mentioned in relation to mathematics and philosophy, not primarily as a literary figure.
*   **D: Aristophane ni:** Similar to Sophocles, Aristophanes is named as an author, but not the most famous one mentioned.



"
Hebre dinghku ni gaw shanhte a aten hpe gara shara kaw grau nna shama ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Nta hpang hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Hebre dinghku nta masha ni a prat nkau gaw gangbang kata hpaw byin lai wa sai re.**"" (Hebrew people's customs and traditions are being lost/forgotten).  Then it continues: ""**Num ni gaw nta hpang kaw shat shadu ma ai; seng ni gaw lam maga de yawng nna hpaw da ai.**"" (Some don't care about their heritage; others are trying to revive it).

This directly relates to the question: ""Hebre dinghku ni gaw shanhte a aten hpe gara shara kaw grau nna shama ma ai kun?"" (Why are the Hebrew customs and traditions being lost/forgotten?). The answer is **""Nta hpang hta""** (Because of their own people/heritage – meaning some within the community are neglecting it).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nbung katsi lu ai shara:** (Words that are said carelessly) - This isn't related to the passage's content.
*   **B: Lam ntsa:** (Bad laws) -  The passage doesn't mention laws.
*   **D: Nta kata hta:** (Their ways) - While related, ""nta hpang hta"" (their heritage/people) is more precise in the context of the passage's discussion of internal reasons for loss of tradition.



"
Hebre dinghku ni a matu gara gaw nau n ahkyak ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte a du hkra ladaw**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Sinpraw Ka'ang na kahtet ai du hkra ladaw hta, nta gaw grai ahkyak nre sai."" This translates to ""Because Sinpraw Ka'ang experienced hardship, the Hebrews also felt it.""  The question (Q) asks what the Hebrews felt, and the passage directly links their feeling to the hardship *du hkra ladaw* experienced by Sinpraw Ka'ang, which refers to the Shan people's hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shanhte a seng ni** - While the passage mentions *seng ni* (good times), it doesn't connect it to what the Hebrews felt.
*   **C: Shanhte a nta** - *Nta* (this/that) is too vague to be the answer.
*   **D: Shanhte a shadu ladat** - *Shadu ladat* (suffering) is mentioned, but the direct connection is to *du hkra ladaw* being the cause of the Hebrews' feelings.



"
Scandinavian mungdan ni lapran shai ai lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw n tang madun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Labau**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mungdan shagu """"""""Scandinavian"""""""" re tim, Denmark, Sweden, Norway hte Iceland ni **a labau**, htung lai, hkaw hkam ni, masha ni hta nbung ai hku grai law nga lai wa sai.""  This translates to ""The Scandinavian people, including Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, **live in** these lands...""

The question asks where the Scandinavian people live. ""Labau"" means ""live"" or ""reside"" in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lamu ga:** Means ""name"" or ""called"" - not a location.
*   **C: Htung lai:** Means ""however"" or ""moreover"" - a connector, not a location.
*   **D: Masha:** Means ""people"" - describes *who* lives somewhere, not *where* they live.



"
Greenland hta kadai shawng nga wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo bawsang ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raitim shi a mu tam hte seng nna, Eskrimo bawsang grup ni gaw dai aten kaw na dai shara kaw nga wa sai re.""  This translates to ""Later on, Eskimo groups came and lived there.""  This directly answers the question of who lives in Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Norway masha ni** - The passage mentions Scandinavian countries (including Norway) as origin places of people, but not as current inhabitants of Greenland.
*   **C: Erik the Red** - Erik the Red is mentioned as someone who *discovered* and named Greenland, not as its current population.
*   **D: Swidin amyu sha ni** -  Sweden is mentioned as a Scandinavian country, but not as a current population of Greenland.



"
Gara uhpung gaw shana shat sha yang lahkum lang ai hpe grau ra sharawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lusu ai Roma num ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""lu su ai ni gaw shanhte lusha sha na matu shanhte hkring sa gawk hta hkik hkam lusha sha ku ni hte re hpe ra sharawng ma ai.""  This translates to ""Those who surrender (lusu ai) do not reveal the secrets of the Shan state to outsiders.""  

The question asks what caused the secrets to be revealed. The passage implies the *surrendering* Roma people are the reason.  ""Num ni"" refers to people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matsan ai Roma num ni** - ""Matsan"" means 'caught' or 'arrested'. The passage doesn't link capture to revealing secrets.
* **C: Lusu ai Roma la ni** - ""La"" refers to places, not people.
* **D: Matsan ai Roma la ni** - Combines the incorrect meanings of ""Matsan"" and ""La.""

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Moi na Roma ni a lusha poi hte n seng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Matsan ai manam ni hpe shana shat sha ai hta shadung ai** (Those who are not satisfied with their current situation and are looking for a change).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shai ai lam laga langai gaw matsan ni dum lahkum kaw dung nna num ni hte shanhte lusha sha taw ai ten..."" This translates to ""Those who are not satisfied with their current situation and are looking for a change are the ones who migrate...""  The passage directly links dissatisfaction with seeking a new life elsewhere (migration).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hkoi ni a sha mu hkun ai tsi** (Those who have nothing to lose): The passage doesn't focus on having nothing to lose, but rather *wanting* something better.
* **C: Shana shat sha ten galeng taw ai lusu la ni** (Those who are forced to leave their homes): While circumstances might *force* someone to leave, the initial impetus is dissatisfaction, as stated in the text.
* **D: U magwi shadu bang da ai n-gawt** (Those who want to get rich):  The passage mentions economic opportunity as *a result* of migration, not the primary *reason* for it. The passage states ""moi na Roma ni mung u magwi hpe galoi nshadu sha ga ma ai"" which means ""Moi na Roma does not only seek wealth"".

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw akyu grai na hkra nga na matu mahkoi nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Htung hking kaji**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Htung hking kaji ni gaw labau sakse hte seng ai lam ni hpe nngam ai sha jahkring hkring mat hkrum ai hte grin ai htunghking masa kaba hku na **matsing masat ai lam nlu ma ai**.""  This directly translates to ""The study of history examines the causes of events, looks at the consequences of actions, and *doesn't allow for baseless speculation*.""

Therefore, ""matsing masat"" (baseless speculation) is closely associated with ""htung hking kaji"" (the study of history) within the context of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhpung uhpawng** (City-state) - While mentioned, it doesn't relate to the idea of avoiding baseless speculation.
*   **C: Mare rapdaw** (Society) -  Also mentioned but not directly connected to the concept in the question.
*   **D: Prat dep shinggyim hpawng htunghking masa** (Modern philosophical thought) - While the passage touches on it, it's not the primary focus related to avoiding speculation.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan langai a matu hpa gaw ningshawng re ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Htung hking langai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Htung hking langai hpe tsun ai re..."" (Civilization began with settlements...) and later says ""...htunghking masa kaba hku na matsing masat ai lam nlu ma ai"" (did not stop developing from settlements).  This directly connects the beginning of civilization to settlements (""htung hking langai"") and their continued development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Prat dep shinggyim hpawng htunghking masa:**  While mentioned, it's presented as a result *of* settlement, not the initial starting point or reason for development.
* **C: Mare rapdaw:**  This refers to cities, which are a *result* of civilization and settlements, not the cause of its development.
* **D: Htung hking kaji ni:** This refers to laws within settlements, which are also a consequence, not the origin.

* **The passage states:** ""Dai gaw shaning 1649 hta, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel gaw Tibentan-Mongol ni hpe dang wa ai hpe bai myit dum na matu dai dap hpe galaw wa ai re.""  This translates to ""This was built in 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw Bhutan hta nga ai** - While true, this doesn't explain *why* it was built.
* **C: Ninghkap hpung a sali wunli ni grai law hpe wan gaw jahten kau ya ai** - This refers to a fire in 1951, which is a later event, not the reason for its initial construction.
* **D: Dai hpe Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel galaw da ai re** - While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *ordered* it built, it doesn't state the *purpose* of its construction.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shaning 1951 kaw gaw, wan gaw Drukgyal Dzong a sali wunli nkau myi sha, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal a sumla jawn re ai ni hpe sha ngam mat hkra galaw lai wa sai.""  This translates to: ""In 1951, the fort was severely damaged by fire, destroying the statues of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibetan-Mongol hpyen dap ni gaw awngdang lam lu ma ai:** While the passage mentions Tibetan-Mongol forces being defeated, it doesn't link them to the *fire* damage.
* **C: Dai gaw gumhkawng ai lam hpe gaw akyu n hkra ya ai:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about the cause being obscure. It clearly states fire was the cause.
* **D: Dai hpe Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel makawp maga da ai:** Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong; he didn't cause its destruction.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tsa ban 18 jahtum na shaning ni hta Vietnam gaw Cambodia de hpyen n-gun hte shang gasat ai."" (In the 18th century, Vietnam invaded and damaged Cambodia.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vietnam amyu ni gaw Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ai** (The Vietnamese army captured Phnom Penh) - While the passage mentions Phnom Penh being taken, it doesn't specifically say *by* the Vietnamese.  It was taken by Thailand in 1772.
* **B: 1772 hta Cambodia ni gaw Thailand hpe shang gasat ai** (In 1772 Cambodia damaged Thailand) - The passage says the opposite – Thailand damaged Cambodia in 1772.
* **D: Thai ni gaw Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ai** (The Thai captured Phnom Penh) - This is true according to the passage (1772), but the question asks about Cambodia *suffering* damage, and Vietnam is linked to that suffering.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tsa ban 18 jahtum na shaning ni hta Vietnam gaw Cambodia de hpyen n-gun hte shang gasat ai."" (In the late 18th century, Vietnam also invaded and caused trouble for Cambodia.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 1772 hta Thai ni hte Vietnam ni Cambodia hpe shang gasat ai** (In 1772, both Thai and Vietnam invaded Cambodia) - While the passage mentions Thailand invading in 1772, it doesn't state they *both* invaded at the same time.  It states Vietnam's invasion was *later* in the 18th century.
* **C: Vietnam amyu ni gaw Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ai** (The Vietnamese army captured Phnom Penh) - The passage says Thailand captured Phnom Penh, not Vietnam.
* **D: Thai ni gaw Cambodia hpe grai lang shang gasat yu ai** (Thailand also invaded and caused trouble for Cambodia) - While true, the question asks what *also* caused trouble for Cambodia, and the passage specifically highlights Vietnam's role *in addition* to Thailand's.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1624 ning hta e, Dutch sinpraw Kala hpaga hpung gaw Taiwan sinna dingda maga kaw rung dung hpang ai...""  This directly translates to ""In 1624, the Dutch East India Company began to occupy Taiwan as part of its colonial ambitions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: N-gu, jum dwi zawn re ai rai ni hpe shawng lu htuk shapraw na matu shaman ai:** This doesn't relate to the Dutch arrival. It talks about ladat (taxes) and shaping, not the initial occupation.
* **C: Dai masing hta miwa bungli galaw ai masha ni hpe bungli jaw ai:** This is too vague and doesn't directly address the question about the Dutch.
* **D: Taiwan kaw na Qing hkawhkam wang du hkra up hkang mayu ai:** This refers to the Qing dynasty's rule, *after* the Dutch period, not the reason for the Dutch arrival.

Shimonoseki ga shaka gaw gara hku hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shawng nnan na Sino-Japan Majan hta Japan ni hkrat sum ai shaloi** (When Japan won the Sino-Japanese War).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Shaning 1895 hta Shawng Nnan Sino-Japan Majan (1894-1895) hta hkrat sum ai hpang, Qing asuya gaw Shimonoseki myit hkrum let mat htu nna Taiwan a awm dawm ahkang aya hpe Japan de ap kau ya mat nna dai zunlawng hpe shaning 1945 du hkra up hkang wa sai.""  This directly translates to: ""In 1895, when Japan won the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government was forced to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki and ceded Taiwan to Japan, a situation that lasted until 1945.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the Qing Dynasty did rule Taiwan, the Shimonoseki treaty was the *reason* they lost control, not a continuation of their rule.
*   **C:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D:**  While Taiwan *did* end up under Japanese rule, this is the *result* of the war and treaty, not the reason for the treaty itself.



"
Dat jasat pH madang hpe gara hku shadawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dat jasat hta rawng ai Hydrogen ion ni a shadawn shadang** (The amount of Hydrogen ions in the substance).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dai pH madang gaw chemical jep da ai kaw na Hydrogen (pH kata na H) ion kade lawm ai hpe madi madun ai."" (This pH value is measuring the amount of Hydrogen (pH is represented by H) ions in a chemical substance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dat jasat gaw gara hku npawt nhpang re ai shing nrai et sit dat kade rawng ai** (The substance is showing something that is strong or weak depending on how much it spreads) - This is too vague and doesn't directly relate to pH.
* **B: Dat jasat hta myihprap la dat ni ade rawng ai** (The amount of base in the substance) - While base affects pH, pH *measures* hydrogen ions, not base.
* **D: Dat jasat hta myihprap yi dat ni kade lawm ai rai** (What is made of acid in the substance) - Similar to B, acid affects pH, but pH isn't measuring acid directly, it's measuring hydrogen ions.



"
Hydrogen ions kaw nna hpa hpe shawkau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myihprap la dat rawng ai shing mun ni**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dai pH madang gaw chemical jep da ai kaw na Hydrogen (pH kata na H) ion kade lawm ai hpe madi madun ai.""  and then explains that pH measures the concentration of Hydrogen ions – specifically, *myihprap la dat rawng ai shing mun ni* (Hydrogen ions).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is *what measures* the hydrogen ions, not the ions themselves.
* **C: Jum dat rawng ai:** This refers to acidity, a *result* of hydrogen ion concentration, not the ions themselves.
* **D: Myihprap yi dat rawng ai shing mun ni:** The passage clarifies that pH deals with *myihprap la dat rawng ai shing mun ni* (lower concentration of Hydrogen ions) and not the higher concentration.



"
Npu e jaw da ai lam ni kaw nna hkanghkyi dabang hpe teng ai hku n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte kaw gwi hpung ni zawn sat lawat nga ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where people are experiencing hardship (""hkanghkyi"") and are struggling to find enough food.**  It mentions people being weak and unable to work (""nmyit mada ai sha hkanghkyi"").
* **The passage then states that people (""shanhte"") are relying on wild plants and roots (""gwi uhpung"") to survive (""zawn sat lawat nga ai"").**  This directly addresses how they are coping with the hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ala hte ayi na ruk gaw maren n re ai (Husband and wife are quarreling)** - The passage doesn't mention any marital disputes.
* **C: Ayi hte ala ni gaw yawng matut mahkai lam nga ai (Husband and wife are living far apart)** - The passage doesn't discuss distance between couples.
* **D: dai hkanghkyi ni gaw si chye nna uhpung hte nga ai (This hardship is only related to food)** - While food is a central issue, the passage implies broader hardship impacting people's ability to work and function.



Therefore, option A best summarizes the coping mechanism described in the passage."
Npu e jaw da da ai kaw na gara gaw hkanghkying a akyang ni hte seng nna jaw ai hku n tsun dan da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw uhpung hku nga chye ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ngut na shanhte a ashu ashan ni hpe si si htan htan nan hkan ma ai"" which translates to ""and the people, they don't even look at the suffering of others."" This directly links the people (Shanhte) to being uncaring or indifferent (""uhpung hku nga chye ai"" - being without compassion).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention a comparison between their suffering and others.
* **C:** While the passage mentions suffering (""asu ashan""), it doesn't link it specifically to 'ayi' and 'ala lahkawng yen'.
* **D:** The passage doesn't say their suffering is caused by 'kaga ngau kaba' or 'mung bung ai'.



"
Brangtai ni gaw gara a matu ashu shan rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nyau kasha ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpang chyhtum hta, dai kaw nyau kasha ni grai law wa ai (nta kaw rem ai nyau ni lawm ai) dai ni gaw insect, yu, tak te hte u ni zawn akawng ni hpe chye sha ma ai.""  This translates to: ""Regarding the above, those that eat/consume (even those that are disliked) include insects, fish, birds, and animals.""

The question asks what the *brangtai* (food/things eaten) are. The passage directly identifies *nyau kasha ni* (things that are eaten) as including the listed animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Grai kaba ai nyau ni** -  While the passage mentions things that are disliked, it doesn't define *brangtai* as just disliked things.
*   **C: Ram daw re ai nyau ni** -  The passage doesn't focus on things found in the forest.
*   **D: Shat nga ni** - The passage mentions *shat nga ni* (things that are disliked) but doesn’t define *brangtai* as just these things.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna nyau kasha ni gaw gara wa hpe gyam ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Brangtai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""shanhte gaw brangtai kaw na zau nyi ni hte shat nga ni ram kaba ai pran wa madang ashu ashan ni hpe sha ma ai.""  This translates to ""These things (shanhte) are things that harm the crops and plants in the fields and gardens.""  

The question asks what the *nyau kasha* (things/creatures) do. The passage directly links *shanhte* (these things) to *brangtai* (harming/damaging).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gawa atup sha chye ai dusat:** This refers to things that are eaten by animals - not the main action described.
* **C: Shat nga ni:** This means ""scattered"" or ""spread,"" which isn't the primary function described.
* **D: Zau nyi:** This means ""something new,"" which doesn't relate to the context.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na ocelot nyau ni a shan hkwi ladat n re ai gaw gara wa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte a grupyin hkan hpyen wa n chye hkra makoi nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage describes ocelots hunting (nyau) and how they often target the young (hpe lusha galaw ma ai) of other animals. It states that ocelots stalk and eventually kill (gumhtawn nna rim sha ma ai) their prey, often focusing on the vulnerable.
* **The Question:**  The question asks *why* ocelots hunt the young of other animals.
* **Option A - Correct:** ""Shanhte a grupyin hkan hpyen wa n chye hkra makoi nga ai"" translates to ""The young are easier to catch because they are not yet strong."" This directly addresses the reason why an ocelot would target young animals - they are less capable of defending themselves.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:**  Focuses on the same species, not hunting *other* species' young.
    * **C:**  Doesn't explain *why* they hunt the young.
    * **D:**  Mentions only killing, not the *reason* for targeting young.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw ocelot nyau a lam hpe jaw ai hku n tsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw shana e shan atsawm sha gyam lu ai** (The people often experience hardship due to the ocelot's actions).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the ocelot causing trouble:** It steals things (""kaji ni hpe lusha galaw ma ai""), causes damage (""dusat kaji ni hpe re""), and generally disrupts the lives of the people (""shanhte"").
* **The question asks about the *consequence* of the ocelot's behavior.**  Option A directly addresses this consequence – the people experience hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte gaw sumnung ai hku shamu shamawt lu ai** (The people are sad because they are poor) - The passage doesn't focus on poverty, but on the ocelot's disruptive actions.
* **C: Shanhte a manam lu ai atsam gaw yawm ai** (The things people value are lost) - While the ocelot *does* steal things, this doesn’t encompass the full scope of the trouble it causes.
* **D: Shanhte gaw kaji ai ashu shan hpe sha gyam mayu ma ai** (The people don't care about the stolen things) - The passage implies the opposite; they *do* care because the ocelot's actions cause problems for them.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa hpe sharaw a ja dik ai n-gun ngu na n mai myit la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Marawm shabam ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sharaw a marawn shabam ai gaw hkanghkyi a marawn shabam ai zawn grai hpring nlu marawn ai raitim nying ahkre ai, marawn ai ga si ni gaw grau nga ai.""  This directly translates to ""The color of the leopard is similar to the color of the tiger, but its spots are different.""  This means the question is asking about the leopard's *color* (marawn shabam - color/hue).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lung ai** - This means ""patterned"" which isn't the focus of the description.
* **C: Gumtsat ai** - This means ""strong"" or ""powerful"" and isn't mentioned in relation to the leopard's appearance.
* **D: Gang ahkye ai** - This means ""fierce"" or ""aggressive"" and isn't about its physical characteristics.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, sharaw hte hkanghkyi a shai ai lam ni gaw gara wa rai?","The passage (P) describes tigers (sharaw) and leopards (hka chye hpun). It states tigers and leopards both belong to the *Panthera* genus and have spotted coats. It specifically notes the tiger's spots are *darker* than the leopard's. 

The question (Q) asks what distinguishes tigers and leopards.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Shanhte a hka hpung yawt atsam (They both have spotted coats)** - This is *true* but doesn't *distinguish* them; the passage says *both* have spots.
* **B: Shanhte a marawn shabam lu ai atsam (They differ in the color of their spots)** -  This is the correct answer. The passage directly states the tiger's spots are darker.
* **C: Shanhte a gumtsat lu ai atsam (They differ in size)** - The passage doesn't mention size differences.
* **D: Shanhte a gang ahkye lu ai atsam (They differ in their shapes)** - The passage doesn't mention shape differences.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

"Matsing matsat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Robert Hooke gaw kaga nsoi hpaji ninghkrin ni hta hpa shawng di wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Sak hkrung kanu ni hpe yu na matu microscope pat hpe lang ai** (He used a microscope to observe small things).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""England mungdan na nsoi hpaji ninghkring Robert Hooke gaw microscope pat nhpai hte yu nna, matsut hta man bung lawk kaji ni hpe mu lu ai."" (England's famous scientist Robert Hooke used a microscope and was able to observe tiny things).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Si mat ai cell ni hpe sawk tam ai** (He discovered cells) - While Hooke *observed* cells, the passage doesn't explicitly state he *discovered* them as the first person.  It says he observed tiny structures.
* **C: Lawk kaji hpe sawk tam ai** (He discovered tiny things) - This is too broad. The passage focuses on his use of the microscope for observation.
* **D: Sak hkrung kanu ni a kaji dik ai galaw hkawm sa ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai** (He discovered things about how small things move and function) - The passage doesn't mention Hooke discovering anything about the *function* of small things, only observing them.



"
Cell ngu ai gasi a n pawt lachyum gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Gawk kaji**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cell ga si gaw Latin ga kaw na sa wa nna de **lachyum gaw gawk kaji ngu ai re.**"" (The origin of the cell is from Latin, and it is said that *lachyum* is **observational**.)

Therefore, the question ""Cell ngu ai gasi a n pawt lachyum gaw hpa rai?"" (What is the origin of the cell called?) is answered by ""Gawk kaji"" (Observational).



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, dusat ni malawng hta hpa galaw lu na atsam nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shamu shamawt ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Dusat malawng gaw shamu shamawt chye ma ai."" (The dust in the darkness doesn't fly/scatter.)
* **The question (Q) asks:** What happens to the dust in the darkness?

Therefore, the passage directly answers the question, stating the dust remains *shamu shamawt* (still/calm/not scattered).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pyen ai (Changed/Different):** The passage doesn't mention the dust changing.
* **C: Hka hpung yawt ai (Falling down):** The passage doesn't mention the dust falling.
* **D: Ga htu ai (Hot):** While the passage mentions heat, it doesn't say the dust *is* hot. It says people are hot and thirsty.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai hte maren, nkau dusat ni hta hpa n nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Cell ni**

Here's why:

The passage (P) repeatedly refers to a ""dusat"" (house) and describes things *inside* the house – cells, people, and objects. The question (Q) asks what is *inside* the house (""dusat ni hta hpa n nga ai rai?"").  Therefore, ""cell ni"" (the cell) is the most logical answer as it's explicitly mentioned as being within the house.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shat rin atsam (Things that are scattered):** While the passage mentions things being scattered, it doesn't define *what* is inside the house.
* **C: Bawnu ni (People):** People are *in* the house, but the question asks what specifically is *inside* the house, and ""cell"" is a more direct answer from the text. The passage also describes the house *containing* people, not being defined *by* them.
* **D: Sha na atsam (Things that are warm):**  Warmth is mentioned, but it's a characteristic, not something that constitutes the contents *of* the house.



"
Jan kaw hpun lusha shabyin ai ladat hte galaw ai lam hta hpun ni hpe hpa gaw karum ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lusha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jan kaw hpun lusha shabyin ai ladat hte galaw la ma ai."" This directly translates to ""The reason the plant is lush and vibrant is because...""  The question asks *why* the plant is lush and vibrant. Therefore, ""Lusha"" (lushness/vibrancy) is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shingnip shingna (Life/Living things):** While plants are living things, the passage doesn't specifically connect lushness to the general concept of life.
*   **B: Dusat ni (Water):** Water is important for plants, but the passage doesn't state it *directly* causes the lushness.
*   **D: Jan (Cause/Reason):** The passage speaks *about* the cause, but ""jan"" itself isn't the characteristic being asked about. It's the *result* of the cause—the lushness—that is the answer.



"
Masha ni sa sharaw ai nsa hpe hpun ni gara hku chyup la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Oxygen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpun ni gaw shinggyim masha nsa sa na matu **oxygen** hpe shapraw ai..."" (The plant takes in carbon dioxide and releases **oxygen**...).  The question asks what the plant releases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lusha** - ""Lusha"" means fruit, and while plants *have* fruit, it's not what they release during this process.
*   **C: Hka** - ""Hka"" means water. Plants use water, but don't primarily *release* it in this context.
*   **D: Carbon dioxide** - The passage explicitly says the plant *takes in* carbon dioxide, not releases it.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai ga shadawn ni kaw na gara gaw galu gaba ai lam hpe pat shingdang ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Masha jahpan gaw shara nnan hta nga man na matu shaman ya ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses how variations (masha jahpan) within a population (shara nnan) allow for adaptation.**  It states that these variations, even those that seem insignificant, can be crucial for survival (""nbung ai rudi ruhpang hte nbung ai shingjawng masha ni nga ai majaw""). The passage emphasizes that these variations enable a species to exist and thrive (""shaman ya ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhpung kaji ai ni gaw shara nnan hta sak hkrung na matu hkrat sum ma ai:** This translates to ""What is being discussed is not a summation of hardship within the population.""  The passage *is* about something within the population, it's about variation.
* **B: Shara nnan de htawt mat wa ai masha jahpan langai a dawchyen:** This means ""The variations present within the population are simply changing.""  While variations *do* change, the passage focuses on their *importance* for survival, not just the fact that they change.
* **D: Masha jahpan gaw hpang jahtum hta hpan hkawng byin wa ai:** This means ""Variations are being produced by environmental factors."" The passage doesn't focus on *how* variations arise, but on *what they do*.



Therefore, option C best captures the core idea presented in the passage about the role of variations within a population."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw speciation byin wa ai lam hpe teng ai hku ntsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw masha jahpan nnan gaw grupyin nnan hta chye nga hkra n lu galaw ai rai yang byin ai** (This happens because the population of creatures is divided into groups and then changes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""masha jahpan nnan ni gaw grupyin nnan hta chye nga hkra shaman la hpang ma ai, dai hpang shanhte gaw kaga masha ni zawn sha yawm magang wa ma ai."" This directly translates to ""the population of creatures is divided into groups and then they no longer interbreed with each other."" This isolation and divergence is a key element of speciation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw galu gaba ai lam a ahkyak ai ningmu re** (This is just a statement about the process happening) - It doesn't explain *why* speciation happens.
* **C: Dai gaw amyu hpan nnan byin wa ai lam hpe madi madun ya ai** (This explains how it affects populations but not the *cause*.) -  It's a consequence of speciation, not the driving force.
* **D: Dai byin ai lam gaw koi kau n mai ai lam re** (This is a vague statement and doesn’t relate to the text.) - It simply states the process is happening without explaining why.



"
Sai gayin ai ladat hta gara wa gaw sai hpe salum de sa ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sai dat lasa ni**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Salum kaw na tube kata sai hkawm mat ai hpe sai dat lasa ngu tsun nna tube kata hku salum de bai wa ai hpe sai ginhtan lasa ngu tsun ai."" This directly translates to ""The one who skillfully hides things is considered clever, and the one who reveals hidden things is considered insightful.""  The passage equates skillfully *hiding* things to being considered clever – which is what ""sai dat lasa"" means (being clever/skillful).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kara zawn san ai lasa ni** - This means ""being knowledgeable,"" which isn't the main point of the passage.
* **C: Gindai ni** - This means ""being modern,"" which has nothing to do with the passage.
* **D: Sai lam ni** - This means ""being wise,"" while related to cleverness, it's not the specific quality described as being *considered* by others in the passage.



"
Gara tingrat gaw sai gayin ai ladat a kaji dik ai wa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kara zawn san ai lasa ni**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement:** Talks about something being good (sai) and then says it's like finding something after searching a long time (kara zawn grai kaji ai sai lam ni).  This implies a long, difficult search leading to a rewarding find.
* **Q's question:** Asks what's being found *after* effort.
* **A (Kara zawn san ai lasa ni - Found after a long search):**  Directly reflects the meaning of the original statement – the good thing is found after a long search.
* **B (Sai dat lasa ni - Found easily):** Contradicts the ""long search"" element.
* **C (Sai lam ni - Just good):** Doesn't explain *how* it was found.
* **D (Gindai ni - Today):** Irrelevant to the meaning.



Therefore, **A** best answers the question based on the information given in **P**."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw shingtai sumpra ni a singkaw bai zing ai atsam hpe jat ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shara makoi ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the *shingtai sumpra* (likely referring to a natural environment or system) as being damaged and losing its vitality. It states that the damage comes from things that ""matse lapye ai masha"" (things that cause destruction) and leads to a ""shara ni a grau dam ai bum yan langai jaw ai lam"" – a situation where the land is becoming barren and lifeless.  ""Shara makoi ai"" (land becoming barren) directly reflects this described outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lusha madi shadaw ai (things are becoming lush/green):** The passage explicitly states the opposite - things are *dying* and becoming barren.
* **C: Manang tam ai (things are flourishing):** Again, this contradicts the passage's description of decline.
* **D: Pyen ai lam a chyang shadang (a change in the way things are done):** While the passage implies a need for change, it doesn't identify *how* things are changing, only the *result* of the damage – a barren landscape.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na hpa gaw shingtai sumpra ni a pyen lu ai lam a majaw akyu nga ai lam hpe matsing masat ga yan hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lusha mahkawng ai (Lusha - beautiful/attractive)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the beauty and allure (lusha) of the Shingtai landscape. It talks about how it captivates people, drawing them in and making them forget their worries.  The passage focuses on its attractiveness and how it impacts those who experience it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shangai shaprat ai lam (Shanghai shaped/formed lam):** The passage doesn't mention Shanghai or discuss how something is shaped.
* **B: Asak ladaw (Asak - difficult/hard ladaw):**  The passage describes something pleasant and appealing, not difficult.
* **D: Tsam rawng ai lam (Tsam - poison/toxic rawng):** The passage describes something beautiful, not poisonous.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the main idea of the passage – the beautiful and captivating nature of the Shingtai landscape."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw dinosaur ni hte n seng ai laklai ai kumla rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hpang lagaw hte hkawm ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*ngut nna shanhte gaw T-Rex ni zawn hpang lagaw lahkawng hte lam hkawm ma ai.*"" which translates to ""...and some of them even competed with T-Rex for food.""  ""Hpang lagaw hte hkawm ai"" directly reflects this competition for food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amun nga ai** - This means ""that are found"" and isn't the main point of the passage about their behavior.
*   **C: Di di ai** - This means ""small"" and while some dinosaurs were small, it's not the answer to the question.
*   **D: Lagaw lamyin nga ai** - This means ""food sources"" which is related, but not the specific action described (competing *for* food).



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna dinosaur ni hte u ni a n bung ai laklai ai kumla ngu nna gara wa hpe n mai sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hpang lagaw lahkawng lang na lam hkawm ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ngut nna shanhte gaw T-Rex ni zawn hpang lagaw lahkawng hte lam hkawm ma ai"" which translates to ""and some of them, even with T-Rex, were able to walk together.""

The question asks about what dinosaurs *could* do, and the passage specifically mentions their ability to walk with even the T-Rex.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di di ai (This is it):**  Too vague and doesn't relate to a specific dinosaur ability.
* **C: Pyen lu ai atsam lu ai (Changed and became something else):** The passage doesn't discuss dinosaurs changing into other things.
* **D: Lamyin lawm ai lagaw (Walking with a limp):** The passage doesn't mention any lameness or difficulties in walking.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Triceratop gaw cycad a gara daw hpe sha ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpun mat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Triceratop ni gaw dai hpun mat hpe nsha shi yang alap ni hpe shi ngup masen hte yeng kau lu ai."" This translates to ""Triceratops did not refuse to eat the leaves of trees and shrubs.""  The question asks what Triceratops ate, and the passage specifically mentions *hpun mat* (leaves of trees/shrubs).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masen ai namlap:** (Not edible plants) The passage doesn't say Triceratops avoided certain plants.
*   **C: Ru pawt:** (Roots) The passage doesn't mention roots.
*   **D: Namsi:** (Fruit) The passage doesn't mention fruit.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna Triceratop gara ni hpe ra sha ai rai? ","The correct answer is **B: Grai ja ai lakung ni nga ai hpun**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ndai hpun ni gaw gung grai rawng ai baw rai nga ai..."" which translates to ""...this plant was likely a large, grazing plant...""  The question asks what Triceratops likely ate.  Therefore, a large grazing plant is the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sangang:** While the passage mentions ""sangang"" (branches), it doesn't state Triceratops specifically ate them.
* **C: Hkai ke:** ""Hkai ke"" refers to a specific type of fern and the passage only says it *might* have been part of the plant Triceratops ate, not its primary food.
* **D: Gung rawng ai asi si ai hpun:** This translates to ""large, thorny plants"" and the passage doesn't indicate Triceratops ate thorny plants.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna Itali mung dingdung de nga ai mungdaw ni hta gara ginsup hpan gaw grau nna gumhkawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lata bawlung**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""lata bawlung"" (weightlifting) as one of the sports Italy excelled in during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, alongside other sports like gymnastics, rowing, water-polo, etc. The question asks which sport Italy was successful in *during* that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bawlung:** While ""bawlung"" (gymnastics) is mentioned, ""lata bawlung"" (weightlifting) is more specifically highlighted in relation to the timeframe.
*   **C: Hkyen jawn ai:** (Rowing) is mentioned, but not directly linked to a particular success during the 2006 World Cup context.
*   **D: F1 mawdaw gau shingjawng ai:** (Formula 1) is simply listed as one of the sports Italy participates in, without any mention of success during that period.

"Masting masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw tawn da ai ginsup hpan ni hta gara wa gaw Itali mung hpe mungkan a ginsup ninghkrin poi hta dang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Gawdin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Itali a myu sha gawdin hpung gaw 2006 hta FIFA Mungkan Kumhpa Gawm ninghkring re nna de a hpang gaw Germani myu sha gawding uhpung gaw mungkan hta nambat lahkawng awngdang dik hpung re ma ai."" This translates to ""The Italian team won the 2006 FIFA World Cup, defeating the German team in the final."" 

The question asks what sport Italy won a championship in. The passage explicitly states it was **gawdin** (football/soccer).



"
Gara mabyin ngut ai hpang Luxembourg a nkau daw chyen ni gaw Belgian byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgian Revolution hpang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Belgium na ya aten ni gaw Luxembourg na moi na aten ni re raitim Belgian gaw shaning 1830 Belgian Revolution hpang byin wa ai re.""  This translates to ""Belgium's independence was also linked to Luxembourg's independence, as Belgium gained independence through the Belgian Revolution of 1830.""

Therefore, the Belgian Revolution is the event directly linked to Luxembourg gaining its independence as described in the text.



"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw Luxembour a wahkrang nga masa hpe hkra machyi shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: German ni a up hkang ai lam** (The fact that it was occupied by Germany).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Luxembourg gaw galoi mung ka-ang ai mungdan langai hku nga shakut ai, raitim Mungkan Majan I hte Mungkan Majan II hta gaw Germany ni shi hpe aup hkang wa sai."" (Luxembourg was often caught in the crossfire of great powers, especially as it was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II.) This directly links Germany's occupation as a significant influence on Luxembourg's history and a challenge it faced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uropa Munghpawm uhpung de hpung shang wa ai** (Becoming a founding member of the European Union) - While important, this is a later development and doesn't explain the *challenges* Luxembourg faced.
* **C: Belgian Revolution hpang** (The Belgian Revolution) - This is related to Luxembourg's formation but doesn't represent an ongoing challenge *to* Luxembourg itself. It was a factor *in* its history, not a hardship it endured.
* **D: Shanglawt ai mungdan tai wa ai** (Being a small country) -  Being a small country is a characteristic, not a challenge described *in the passage*. The passage highlights external pressures (occupation) as the main hardship.



"
Europe kata hta Turkey a lamu ga gaw kade square kilometers nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""Turkey shara gaw mungkan hta 37th kaba dik re, ngut nna dai gaw Metropolitan France hte the United Kingdom pawng da ai daram re. Turkey mungdan hpe panglai masum gaw shinggrup tawn ai: sinna maga de gaw Aegean panglai, ding dung maga de gaw Panglai Chyang hte dingda maga de gaw Hkarang panglai ni rai nga ai. **Nawng ni ma lawm, Turkey mungdan a shara gaw, 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi) kaba ai re nna, 755,562 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) gaw Asia dan a dingda sinna maga re nhktawm 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) gaw Europe maga hkran de re.**""

This directly states that 23,764 square kilometers of Turkey's land is in Europe."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Turkey gaw mile kade ram galu ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Turkey madu ai ginwang ni gaw 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) galu nna 800 km (500 mi) hta grau dam nga nna rectangular hkrang zawn rai nga ai.""  This means Turkey's width is 1,600 kilometers *or* 1,000 miles. The question asks for the answer in miles.



"
Vatican mare kaba hta Latin ga hpe hpa na matu jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nawku htung hte seng ai poi ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Latin ga hpe gaw nawku htung hte seng ai poi shingra hkan jai lang ma ai."" This directly translates to ""...Latin language was not widely used and gradually disappeared.""  This explains *why* Latin is no longer commonly used in Italy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shani shagu na matut mahkai lam:** This refers to Italy's history, not specifically the decline of Latin.
* **C: Tara upadi ka lajang ai lam:** This refers to the location of Vatican City within Italy.
* **D: Tara shang matut mahkai lam:** This refers to things that are generally known about Vatican City.



"
"Vatican mare kaba hta, Italy ga hpe hpa na matu lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tara upadi ka lajang ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vatican mare kaba kaw gaw **Italy ga hpe shi a upadi ka lajang ai lam** hte tara shang matut mahkai ai lam hta jai lang ai re.""  This directly translates to ""Vatican city is located **within the borders of Italy** and is described as being completely independent.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tara shang matut mahkai lam** - While the passage *mentions* tara shang matut mahkai, it's not the answer to *how* Italy relates to Vatican City.
* **C: Nawku htung hte seng ai poi ni** - This refers to Latin language and isn't about the location of Vatican City.
* **D: Shani shagu na matut mahkai lam** - This talks about Italy's history but doesn't explain its relationship with Vatican City.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw prat dep kompyuta nsen shatsawm ai lam kaw nna akyu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Animation ladat ni** (Animation specifically).

Here's why:

* **P's passage** describes how the second computer is used to create videos, specifically mentioning animation and how it makes things move realistically (unlike just showing them on TV). The core point is the *process* of creating moving images – animation.

* **Q's question** asks what specifically is used to make computers capable of this.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yu ngwi (You/This)** - Doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
* **C: Sumla ni (Computer)** -  The passage talks *about* computers, but the question asks what *capability* computers have, not what the object itself is.
* **D: Gawgap ai lam (Difficult thing)** - The passage doesn't focus on difficulty.



Therefore, **animation** is the specific thing mentioned in the passage that enables computers to create realistic moving images, making **B** the correct answer."
"Matsin masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara shara na nta law malawng hta namdum hka gang jahkrat ai baw lawm ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harappa hte Mohenjo-daro a mare ni kaw gaw nta shagu ngu na daram hka gang namdum lu ma ai...""  This translates to something like ""Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were ancient civilizations...""  The question asks which civilization is mentioned.  Mohenjo-daro is explicitly named.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Parsha** - Parsha is mentioned as one of the rivers *near* the civilizations, not a civilization itself.
* **C: Santorini** - Santorini is mentioned as a comparison point (like Crete), but it's not the civilization the passage *starts* discussing.
* **D: Miwa** - Miwa is mentioned as a river, similar to Parsha.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara shara kaw madang tsaw namdum gawda hkrang hpe mu lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Santorini**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngam ai namdum gawda hkrang ni hpe Crete zunlawng na Minoan mare hkan hte Greece mungdan na Santorini zunlawng ni hkan nga ai nta ni hta mu lu ai.""  This translates to: ""This kind of architecture is similar to the Minoan civilization of Crete and the Santorini island of Greece.""

Therefore, Santorini is the place specifically mentioned as being architecturally similar to the described civilization.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw skate jawn ai wa hpe lu gayin hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Skate nhtu npu hta nga ai kashawt ai baw magaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) talks about practicing hockey (hkyen pa).** It mentions someone falling (hkyepdin) and getting up, and the difficulties of learning.
* **Question (Q) asks what the reason is for someone falling while skating.**
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Skate nhtu npu hta nga ai kashawt ai baw magaw"" translates to ""Because they are not skilled at skating, they fall.""  This aligns perfectly with the passage's theme of learning and struggling with a new skill (hockey/skating).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Skate nhtu dingren a matu lahkawng (The difficulty of skating for beginners)** - While true, it doesn't *explain* the fall itself, just the general difficulty.
* **C: Skate jawn ai masha a kung kyang ai madang (The place where someone skillful at skating practices)** -  This is unrelated to falling.
* **D: Hkyen pa madang (Hockey field)** - This is simply the location, not the reason for a fall.

Here's why:

* **P's passage focuses heavily on ""nten lahkawng"" (problems/difficulties).** It describes their origin, how they affect people, and how they linger. The entire passage revolves around understanding and dealing with these difficulties.
* **Q's question asks about the core issue being discussed – the source of suffering or hardship.** ""Nten-lahkawng"" directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Magaw (thoughts/ideas):** While thoughts contribute to problems, the passage focuses on the *problems themselves*, not just the thinking.
* **C: Lahkyawk (old/past):**  The passage discusses the *origin* of the problems, but ""lahkyawk"" doesn't represent the problems themselves.
* **D: Ding yau ai (being stubborn):** Stubbornness might *contribute* to problems, but isn't the central topic.



Therefore, **Nten-lahkawng** is the most fitting answer, as it encapsulates the main subject matter of the passage P."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, atom ni gaw ninghtoi kaw na jan pru wa ai dat atsam hpe shapraw kau ya lu ai ladatgaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Photon**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on photons.** The entire text explains how atoms emit and interact with photons, especially in the context of radio waves. It describes how photons are created, how they interact with atoms to cause movement, and how they carry energy.
* **The question asks what causes atoms to move.** The passage explicitly states: ""Photo ni gaw atom hpe galaw ai ri ni hta grau kaji ai re."" (Photons cause atoms to move).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rediyu dat n-gun pru ai (Radio data being emitted):** While radio waves (which are photons) are discussed, the *data* isn't what causes the movement, the *photons* themselves do.
* **B: Photon ni shapraw ai lam hpe jasu alun ya ai (The process of photon creation):** The *creation* of photons isn't the cause of atomic movement, the photons *themselves* are.
* **D: Rediyu dat shapraw ai lam hpe jasu alun ya ai (The process of radio data creation):**  Similar to A, this focuses on the data rather than the fundamental particle causing the motion.



"
Atom langai kaw na photon shapraw ai lam gaw gara hku byin ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Grai tu htoi ai nhtoi a majaw byin pru wa ai jasu alun ya ai lam** (The process by which energy is released as an electron jumps to a lower energy level).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how atoms absorb and emit photons.**  When an atom absorbs energy (like from radio waves), its electrons jump to higher energy levels. When they fall back to lower energy levels, they *emit* photons – that's how radio waves are created in this context. This ""jumping"" to a lower energy level and releasing energy is the core of the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shajan dat atsam hpe shapraw ya ai** (Just describing atoms) - Too general. The passage is about a *specific* process.
* **C: Zim n re ai dat n-gun madang ni** (Something about a dark matter field) -  The passage doesn't mention dark matter.
* **D: Rediyu dat a matu akyu n jaw ai ginhtang** (A device that receives radio data) - This describes a radio *receiver*, not the process of photon emission from an atom.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, hpa gaw hpang jahtum hta wan pu langai hpe bungli galaw hkring mat hkun mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Socket kata de wan ngun lwi ai lam lanyen ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) heavily focuses on a problem with a socket.** It describes difficulties connecting (""kaw na gumhpaw de sa wa""), needing to jumpstart it (""sa jum yang dai kaw""), and the overall issue revolving around the socket.
* **The question (Q) asks about what prevents the light from turning on.**  The passage implies the socket is the source of the problem.
* **Option D directly relates to this:** ""Socket kata de wan ngun lwi ai lam lanyen ai"" translates to ""The reason the light doesn't turn on is because of a problem with the socket.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wan pat shara hpe jaw ai hku n pat da ai:** (The light bulb is broken) - The passage doesn't mention the bulb being broken.
* **B: Wan pu a gyu gaw socket hta daw chyen mi sha lawm ai:** (The wire is not properly connected to the socket) - While connection is mentioned, it's presented as a *result* of the socket issue, not the root cause.
* **C: Wan pu kata na waya sumri kaji ni hkru mat ai:** (The switch isn't working) - The passage doesn't mention the switch at all.



Therefore, **D** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na wan pu galai shakap ai ten hta gara hpe hkra ai gaw dingbai dingna byin wa chye rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Wan hkalap**.

Here's why:

The passage describes someone struggling to plug something into a socket (""dai gaw wan ngun gaw wan pu kaw na gumhpaw de sa wa nna wan ngu hpe jaw ai majaw re nang dai socket kata kaw na gumhpraw hpe sa jum yang dai kaw wan ngun naw nga taw na re."").  The question asks *what* is being struggled with.  ""Wan hkalap"" (the plug/connector) is the thing being attempted to be inserted into the socket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waya sumri kaji:** (Wire something) - The passage doesn't focus on wires, but the connection itself.
* **C: Wan pu a npawt:** (Something is broken) - While there's frustration, the core issue is *connecting* something, not something being broken.
* **D: Sumri:** (Something) - Too vague. The passage is specific about *what* ""something"" is – the plug.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, nucleus ga garan mat yang hpa byin na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Proton ni rawt wa ai** (Protons are positively charged).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Anumyu bawm gaw proton hte neutron ni kaw na ngun hpe la nna bungli galaw ai re."" (Atoms have positively charged protons and neutral neutrons).  This directly links the positive charge to protons.
* **The question asks:** What makes the nucleus positive?
* Since protons are positively charged and *are* in the nucleus, the answer must be that the protons are what make it positive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dat atsam shapraw ai** (It gets stronger) - While the nucleus is held together strongly, this doesn't *cause* the positive charge.
* **C: Atom ni n zim ai** (The atom is neutral) - Atoms are neutral overall, but the nucleus specifically is positive due to protons.
* **D: Neutron ni mat mat ai** (Neutrons are heavy) - Neutrons contribute to mass, but they are *neutral* and don't contribute to positive charge.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpungtang lamu ganghkau na jak shagan ni gaw matut mahkai lu ai hte kalang ta ngu na daram shanhte hpe npu de bai htoi ahkung dat ya ai re."" (The things sent into space are useful for communication and help people in remote areas.) and ""Hpungtang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw sumtsan yu myiset ni hpe hpuntang lamu ganghkau kata e lang nga ai..."" (The things orbiting the earth are satellites sent into space...).

The question asks what is *sent* into space. The passage clearly identifies **satellites** as being sent into space for communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jak shagan ni** (things) - Too general. The passage specifies *what* things.
* **C: Ninghtoi** (orbit) - Describes *where* something is, not *what* is being sent.
* **D: Rocket ni** (rockets) - Rockets are used to *launch* things into space, they aren't the things being sent themselves.



"
Ganghkau de sumtsan yu myiset ni bang na matu ndai kaw na hpa ni hpe lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Rocket ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jak shagan hpe hpungtang lamu ganghkau kata de gaw **rocket** hte shalung dat ai re.""  This translates to ""The way to send the object into space is by **rocket**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ninghtoi:** While ""ninghtoi"" (technology) is involved, it's not *what* is used to send things into space.
*   **C: Mungkan a nbung shing:** This refers to the results of the technology, not the technology itself.
*   **D: Pe 100 hta jan nna tsaw ai jak shagan ni:** This describes *what* is being sent, not *how* it's being sent.

* **The passage describes past events and reflections on those events.** It talks about things *that were done* (""anhte yawng a makau grupyin kaw nga ai""), *what happened* (""anhte galaw ai yawng mayawng kaw akyu pru ai""), and *remembering* (""rai tim chye na na yak ai"").
* The question asks about what the passage is *about*. The entire passage is a recollection and discussion of past occurrences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aten ladaw (The present):** The passage focuses entirely on the past, not the current situation.
* **C: Akyu nga ai lam (Things that are known):** While the passage *relates* knowledge, it's not about knowledge itself, but the events that led to that knowledge.
* **D: Yak hkak ai lam (Things that will happen):**  The passage is explicitly about what *has already happened*, not future events.



"
"Matsing masat ga ya hta tsun da ai hte maren, aten hte shingdaw na matu gara mabyin masa ni hpe lang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Kade ram na ai lam** (The issue of being displaced/having land taken).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on people being forced from their land (""kade ram na ai"") and the suffering that results.**  The entire text describes the hardships faced by those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.  It mentions the pain, the lack of support, and the feeling of being forgotten.
* The question asks what is causing the suffering described in the passage. The passage consistently points to the loss of land as the root cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kahtap gala galaw ai lam (The issue of things changing):** While change is *a result* of the displacement, it's not the *cause* of the suffering.
* **C: Mahkrum madup (Difficult living):** This is a consequence, but doesn't explain *why* life is difficult.
* **D: Akyu nga ai lam (Being poor):** Poverty can be a consequence, but again, the passage points to land loss as the initial problem.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the content of the provided text."
"Matsing masa ga yan hta ka dai ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na hkaw hkam aya hkam la na matu gara wa hpe yu yu ngu na sawn la mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 2:2 degree lu la ai** (achieved a 2:2 degree).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ngut nna hpang de labau, 2:2 (madang nem ai jam mau) hpe lu wa ai."" This directly translates to ""he obtained a 2:2 (second class, division two) degree.""
* **The question asks:** about what Charles *achieved* or *obtained* from his studies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hpyen dap de shang na matu dakkasu shangut la ai** (achieved success and attended a good university) - While he attended Cambridge, the passage focuses on his *degree result*, not just attending a good university.
* **C: Labau hpe sharin hkam la ai** (shared his studies) - He *studied* Anthropology and Archaeology, but the focus isn't on *sharing* his studies.
* **D: Hpyen dap hte nshang shi yang dakkasu shawng sa ai** (achieved success and attended university for a long time) -  The passage doesn't say anything about a long duration of study, only his degree result.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw dai ai lam hpe mahta nna, Charles shawng nna galaw ai lam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Janmau langai la ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Raitim, Charles gaw Cambridge kaw na Trinity dakkasu hta Anthropology hte Archaeology hpe sharing wa sai, ngut nna hpang de labau, 2:2 (madang nem ai jam mau) hpe lu wa ai."" This translates to: ""Charles studied Anthropology and Archaeology at Trinity College, Cambridge, and failed his exams, getting a 2:2 (a second-class degree, division two).""
* **""Janmau langai la ai""** means ""failed the exam"" or ""didn't pass."" This directly reflects the information given in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jawng n ngut shi a shaloi hpyen dap de shang ai:** This means ""It's about the subject he studied,"" which is too broad. While he *studied* those subjects, the question asks about what he *did*.
* **B: Archeology hpe hkaja ai:** This means ""studied Archaeology.""  The passage says he studied it, but the key point is he *failed* his exams.
* **D: Trinity dakkasu lung ai:** This means ""attended Trinity College."" This is a fact, but not the answer to *what happened* to him.



"
Trygvasson a hka sanghpaw gaw gara mung kaw na du wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndai chyang lawa ai hpung hpe Olaf Trygvasson kaw na woi awn ai, yaw shada lam kaba ai Norwegian wa gaw Danish ka'up tawn ai kaw na shi mungdan hpe bai hpyi la na matu re."" This translates to: ""Olaf Trygvasson also helped with the tribute, and the Norwegian who was skilled in war gave his army to the Danish side.""

This clearly indicates Olaf Trygvasson was from Norway. Therefore, his origin/kingdom is Norway.



"
Labau a galoi ten hta Germany ni Estonia mung a ntsa htunghking hte seng na aja awa ka-up lai wa ai sairai?,"The passage states: ""Tsa ban 15th daram hta, Estonia dingdung gaw Germany a htunghking grai nan ka'up da ai ten re."" which translates to ""On the 15th of the month, the Estonian people were captured by Germany and brought to Germany.""  Later it says ""Dai majaw shanhte gaw Estonian laika hpe galaw shapraw lai wa ai re. Dai hpe German laika kanu kaw na la da ai re"" meaning ""These people were able to spread the Estonian language. German people learned it.""  The passage doesn't give a specific number of people who learned Estonian, but implies a significant number.  The phrase ""chye wa ai a ningpawt re"" means ""it is a considerable amount.""

Given the options, and the implication of a significant, but not extremely large, number, **C: Lai wa sai 600 ning laman hta (Around 600 people)** is the most reasonable answer.  While the exact number isn't stated, 600 falls within a ""considerable amount"" while the other options are either too low (200, 400) or potentially too high (800) given the context.



Therefore the answer is **C**."
Estonian ga gaw hpa hte ka-up da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Õ/õ laika gasi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai hpe German laika kanu kaw na la da ai re ngut nna """"""""Õ/õ"""""""" hpe kahtap bang da ai re."" This translates to ""They were able to learn German, but they wrote it using the """"""""Õ/õ"""""""" letter.""  This means the Estonian language uses the ""Õ/õ"" letter, and they were incorporating it even when writing in German.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: German ni a laika kanu:** The passage says they *learned* German, not that German is their language.
* **C: German ni a hpunggyi ni:** The passage mentions a German official (hpunggyi) but doesn't state it's the Estonian language.
* **D: Karai Kasang:** Karai Kasang is mentioned as someone who helped, but isn’t the Estonian language itself.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Hindi ga shaga ai masha jahpan gaw gara lawnglam hta npawt nna lung dat yu dat re galai shai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lama na Hindi ga hte grai bung ai buga ga ni hpe hti shalawm yang**

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Focus:** The passage heavily emphasizes the difficulties in accurately determining the number of Hindi speakers due to overlapping language use with Urdu and varying criteria for classification. It states the numbers are estimates ranging from 340 to 800 million.
* **The Question's Core:** The question asks *why* the number of Hindi speakers is uncertain.
* **Answer A's Connection:** Answer A directly addresses this uncertainty, stating that the numbers are estimates because Hindi is mixed with other languages (specifically, *grai bung ai buga* meaning ""other languages"" and strongly implying Urdu). This aligns perfectly with the passage’s main point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lama na Urdu ga shaga ai ni hpe hti shalawm ai rai yang** - While Urdu's connection to Hindi is mentioned, the passage doesn't state uncertainty is *because* of Urdu speakers. It's because of how speakers identify and the overlap.
* **C: Lama na ga hpe chye na ai masha ni hpe hti shalawm ai rai yang** - This simply restates the passage’s mention of different estimated numbers without explaining *why* they differ.
* **D: Lama na dai ga hpe chye hti ai ni hpe hti shalawm ai rai yang** - This is too vague and doesn't address the core reason for the estimation difficulties.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided text."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw Hindi hte Urdu ga a jaw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ga hpan lahkawng shaga ai ni a lapran hta matut mahkai lam di mat ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ga shaga ai marai wan 340 kaw na wan 500 lapran hte wan 800 daram gaw tsun shaga ga hpe chye na ma ai."" (The cost of things ranges from 340 to 500 lapran and 800 daram.)  This directly relates to prices and costs, which is what the question asks about – how things are *priced* in Hindi and Urdu.
* **The passage also says:** ""Hindi hte Urdu gaw ga bungai raitim laika nbung ai; ga shagu, shaga ai lahkang yang shada da chye na ma ai."" (Hindi and Urdu are used for everyday transactions; however, the actual prices are not always clear.) This reinforces the idea that these languages are *used when talking about* prices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte gaw matsun laika nan shai ai** - This talks about scents/smells, which isn’t mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Shanhte gaw gasi ga ngau hte matsun laika lahkawng yen hta bung ai** - This speaks about being cold and smells, irrelevant to the text.
* **D: Shanhte gaw gasi ga ngau nan shai ai** -  This relates to being cold, which is not discussed.



Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects the information provided in the passage regarding Hindi and Urdu’s use in relation to costs/prices."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Hangeul laika kanu hte seng nnan jaw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hkawhkam Sejong up hkang hpang wa ai kaw na dai hpe gin shalat da ai re** (The creation of this was done by King Sejong).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dai laika kanu hpe gaw hkawhkam Sejong uphkang ai shaning (1418-1450) lamang, shaning 1444 hta gyin shalat lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""This alphabet was created during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450), and completed in 1444.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Laika kanu ni a amying majing gaw Hunan Jeongeum nga ai re** (The proper name of this alphabet is Hunan Jeongeum) - While *Hunmin Jeongeum* is the original name, the question asks *who* created it, not *what it was called*.
* **C: Dai hpe Joseon Prat a mali lang na hkawhkam wa gin shalat da ai re** (This was completed by the king of Joseon) - This is true, but less specific than mentioning Sejong by name. The passage focuses on Sejong.
* **D: Dai hpe yaw shada lam nga nga hte galaw da ai re** (This was created to be easy to learn and use) - The passage *implies* this with the definition of Hunmin Jeongeum, but it doesn't directly state it as the answer to *who* created it.



"
Hunmin Jeongeum laika kanu gaw hpang jahtum hpa baw de gale mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sejong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hkawhkam Sejong uphkang ai shaning (1418-1450) lamang, shaning 1444 hta gyin shalat lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""...created by King Sejong (1418-1450), and officially proclaimed in 1444.""  It directly links Sejong to the creation of Hangeul (referred to as Hunmin Jeongeum in the text).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hangeul** - Hangeul *is* the writing system, but it doesn't *create* itself.
* **C: Joseon** - Joseon is the dynasty during which it was created, but not the creator.
* **D: Jeongeum** - Jeongeum is part of the name (Hunmin *Jeongeum*), but not the person who initiated it.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ga ni gaw Sanskirt a shingkang ka-up hkrum ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Latin aga ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sanskrit gaw moi na aga langai re nna dai hpe Uropa a Latin aga hte mai shingdaw yu ai.""  This translates to: ""Sanskrit is related to many languages, and especially similar to the European Latin language.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says Sanskrit is closely related to Latin.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sanskirt hpe jai lang ai lam gaw hpa na majaw mat mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Aryan a bu htawt ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shanhte kaw na langai myi gaw, sinna kaw na India de shanhte a a-ga ni hpe la wa ai Aryan buhkawmg htawtsit hpung langai a lam rai nga ai."" (Meaning: The origin of the language is said to be related to the Aryan people who came to India.) This directly links Sanskrit to the Aryan migration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grai shuk ai majaw:** (Meaning: Simply beautiful) While the passage mentions Sanskrit's beauty, it doesn't explain *how* it came to be.
* **C: Latin aga ni:** (Meaning: Like the Latin language) The passage states Sanskrit is *related* to Latin, but doesn't say that's its origin.
* **D: Aya nem tsaw madang:** (Meaning: Philosophical thoughts) While the Upanishads (philosophical texts) are written in Sanskrit, this doesn’t explain the language's origins.

Lo ntsa kaw nga ai ginding ningmawng n-gun hte seng nna npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw teng ai ndau laika rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mungkan ga a ginding ningmawng n-gun gang ai gaw Lo a ginding ningmawng n-gun gang ai hta tinang hpe gang ai gaw yawm ai.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage describes a situation where Mungkan (90kg) is trying to help Lo (16kg).  The core problem is Lo is having trouble moving something.  The passage states Mungkan *is able* to help Lo move it.
* **The Question:** Asks what helps Mungkan assist Lo.
* **Analyzing the Options:**
    * **A:** This translates to ""Mungkan's ability to help move things is because he can lift what Lo can't."" This directly addresses the situation described in the passage - Mungkan's strength allows him to assist Lo.  This is the most logical answer.
    * **B, C, & D:** These options talk about difficulty (""grau"" - difficult) and don't explain *why* Mungkan is able to help. They focus on the challenge, not the solution (Mungkan’s strength).

Therefore, option A best captures the reason Mungkan can help Lo.

"Matsing masat laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw shata a shinggan htaphpe teng ai hku tsun da ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: Bumga npu hta ntsa lam na htap gaw grau hpa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai gaw maria npu kaw gaw grau hpa ai re nna bumga npu de gaw grau nna htat ai re."" (This means the journey from Maria is going uphill, and from Bumga it's going downhill).
* **The question asks:** Which part of the journey is uphill?
* **Option B directly reflects this:** ""Bumga npu hta ntsa lam na htap gaw grau hpa ai"" (The journey from Bumga is uphill).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ni ai kaw na htap gaw grau htat ai:** This says the journey *to* it is downhill, which is the opposite of what the passage states about Maria.
* **C: Tsan ai shara hkan maria n law ai:** This talks about the distance of the journey, not the uphill/downhill direction.
* **D: Bumga npu hta maria n law ai:** This says the journey *from* Bumga is downhill, which is incorrect according to the text.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, shata a ntsa lam hta gara shara kaw htat dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ni ai makau**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai makau maga de maria ni grau nga mai ai hpa majaw nga yang ntsa lam gaw grau hpa nga ai."" This translates to ""Because of this calculation, even if Maria doesn't go uphill, the road goes uphill.""  This directly indicates the road is uphill (""ni ai makau"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maria grau nga ai shara** (The road where Maria goes uphill): The passage says the road is uphill *regardless* of Maria's uphill journey.
* **C: Bumga npu hta** (At the foot of the hill): The passage talks about both uphill and downhill, but doesn't focus on the starting point.
* **D: Maria a npu hta** (At Maria's place): This is irrelevant to the question about the road's slope.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe masha nkau mikam ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Masha ni gaw kaga shata mung de bu hkawm ga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What does Masha's coming relate to, according to the passage?
* **The passage states (in the beginning):** ""Masha law law wa mi gaw shinggyim masha ni wa kaga shata mung hte kaga mungkan de..."" (Masha came because of a problem, Masha's coming relates to a hardship and difficulty...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Masha's coming *influences* the situation, the passage directly links it to the hardship itself, not simply seeing it through.
* **C:** The passage mentions ""asak hkrung ai"" (something gathering) but doesn't say this is *why* Masha came.
* **D:** This refers to the scale of the ""htingbu"" problem, not the reason for Masha's arrival.



"
Jan ka-ang kaw na tinang tsan magang hpa gawhpa magang byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dat yi la ngun bung dat nsa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dat nsa gaw Jan ka'ang kaw na tsan magang grau hpa wa magang re."" (This refers to what Jan sees as the surface, or the edge).  It then connects this to the ""photosphere."" The question asks what Jan sees as the edge/surface.  ""Dat yi la ngun bung dat nsa"" directly refers to the surface Jan perceives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wan** - While mentioned, it doesn't represent the *edge* Jan sees.
* **C: Dat nsa** - Too broad; it just means ""that thing.""
* **D: Ntsa lam** - Refers to a direction (""towards""), not the surface.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, jan a gara daw hpe mungkan ga kaw nna mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nhtoi shing**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jan hpe yu ai shaloi mu lu ai shinggan maga daw hpe gaw nhtoi shing """"""photosphere"""""""", nga ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""The surface that surrounds Jan is called the """"""photosphere"""""".
* **The question asks:** what surrounds Jan?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntsa lam:**  Refers to something being caught/trapped - not a surrounding surface.
* **B: Dat yi la ngun bung dat nsa:** Refers to a kind of darkness or shade - not a surrounding surface.
* **D: Ka-ang:** Refers to strength or power - not a surrounding surface.

Copernicus a theory hpe shagrin na matu npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara sawk tam ai lam gaw karum ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus a lai sa ai lam** (The transit of Venus).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bai shaning kachyi myi na mat ai hpang shaning 1639 kaw, Jeremiah Horrocks mying ai Englik hpungtang lamu hkam jak gawt masha gaw Venus a lai sa ai lam hpe bai mu sagawn la lu ai.""  This directly translates to ""In 1639, Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, was able to observe the transit of Venus.""
* **Copernicus's theory:** The passage explains that observations of Venus (specifically its phases) supported Copernicus's heliocentric theory.  Observing Venus *transiting* (passing in front of) the sun provided further strong evidence for this theory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Venu a rawt jat ai lam** (Venus being seen) - While Venus being visible is important, the specific event that helped confirm Copernicus's theory was the *transit*.
* **C: Jan hte Venus bung ai lam ni** (The relationship between the Sun and Venus) - The passage mentions this relationship in the context of Copernicus's theory, but it doesn't identify it as the event that provided evidence.
* **D: Jan hte shata bung ai lam ni** (The relationship between the Sun and Earth) - This is related to the overall discussion of the solar system but isn't the specific observation being highlighted.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw 1610 hta Galileo Galilei mu sagawn ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus a byin yan ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1610 ning hta, Itali amyu sha lamu shagan hpaji ninghkring wa Galileo Galilei gaw shata zawn sha Venus mung rawt jat taw ai lam hpe sumtsan yu myiset lang nna maram yu ai.""  This translates to: ""In 1610, the Italian scholar Galileo Galilei observed phases of Venus, a discovery that was very important.""

The question asks what Galileo Galilei observed in 1610. The passage explicitly states he observed the *phases of Venus* (Venus a byin yan ni).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jan de man yawng ai shata a maga mi:** This refers to the appearance of Venus as a ""small disc"" and is a *result* of the observations, not the observation itself.
* **C: Jan hpe mungkan ga gayin nga ai lam:** This relates to Copernicus' theory, which Galileo's observations *supported*, but wasn't what he directly observed.
* **D: Venus a shalai shara:** This isn't mentioned as a specific discovery.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Amazon Mali hka ni gaw gara hka kaw na mahkawng la ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Galu dik hka nu**.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly refers to Amazon as being a ""galu dik hka nu"" (a long river). The question asks what Amazon is *known for* – and the text emphasizes its length.  The other options are either irrelevant or don't reflect the main point of the passage.

* **A: Hka nu kaji ni** - This just means ""river area"" and isn't specific to Amazon.
* **C: Panglai ni** - This doesn't appear in the text and is irrelevant.
* **D: Nambat hkawng kaba dik hka nu** - While the passage mentions *nambat hkawng kaba* (difficult to cross), it's a characteristic *of* the river, not what it's primarily known for.



"
Gara shagrau ai lamgaw Amazon Hka nu hte n seng ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Nambat hkawng kaba dik hka nu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai gaw **nambat lahkawng kaba dik hka nu** hta rawng ai hka shadang a htam 8 jan hkra re rawng ai."" (This refers to the fact that the Amazon River is long and wide).  The question asks what the Amazon River *is* known for.  Being long and wide (nambat hkawng kaba dik) is a key characteristic highlighted in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kaba dik hka nu** - While true, it's not the *specific* thing the passage emphasizes.
*   **C: Galu dik ai hka nu** - The passage mentions it's long (galu) but doesn't focus on that as its defining characteristic.
*   **D: Dam dik ai hka nu** - The passage does not mention anything about the river being ""dam"" (flat/still).



"
Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai kaw na gara bungli ni hta Venezulan masha jahpan n law dik rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hkai lu hkai sha lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""nkau mi gaw rai ni shapraw ai kaw galaw ma ai ngut nna kaang hkup gaw **hkai lau hkai sha bungli hta galaw ma ai**."" This translates to something like ""...and the people are suffering, and the groups are moving around in a chaotic manner.""  This directly relates to the suffering and instability mentioned in the question about Venezuela.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jak rung (Debt):** While the passage mentions debt (""sau jak rung gaw tsa lam shadang langai sha nga tim mungdan jashang gunrai ni hta na grau ai mungdan shapraw gunrai re""), it's a *result* of the problems, not the primary condition of the people.
* **C: Sau (Hot/Spicy):** This is unrelated to the overall meaning of the passage.
* **D: Karum jaw ai lam (Difficult situation):** While Venezuela *is* in a difficult situation, the passage specifically details the *chaotic movement and suffering* of the people, which is best represented by ""hkai lu hkai sha lam.""



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara bungli ni hta Venezuelan masha jahpan law dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hkai lu hkai sha lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) repeatedly mentions ""hkai lau hkai sha"" (disputes/conflicts) within Venezuela.** It talks about conflicts hindering progress and causing instability.  The passage states ""...nkau mi gaw rai ni shapraw ai kaw galaw ma ai ngut nna kaang hkup gaw hkai lau hkai sha bungli hta galaw ma ai."" (…people cannot develop due to conflicts and disputes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Karum jaw ai lam (economic issues):** While the passage *implies* economic hardship, it focuses more on the resulting conflicts than the economic problems themselves.
* **C: Jak rung (political power):**  The passage mentions political issues (struggle for power), but ""hkai lau hkai sha"" is the *direct* result of that struggle, the core problem described.
* **D: Sau (crisis):**  ""Sau"" is a general term for crisis. While Venezuela *is* in a crisis, the passage details the *nature* of that crisis as internal conflict.



Therefore, **""Hkai lu hkai sha lam"" (issues of disputes/conflicts)** best summarizes the central issue the passage describes regarding Venezuela's problems."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gahkying ai lam gaw shagan ni hpe hpa baw ni galaw na ahkang jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Hydrogen atom ni galaw shapraw ai** (Hydrogen atom is being moved/manipulated).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is fundamentally about manipulating a hydrogen atom.** It describes processes related to its position, energy levels (""hkrang shapraw na matu""), and interaction with nuclear forces. The entire text revolves around what's happening *to* the hydrogen atom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grai li ai nhprang jat ni byin hkun ai** (Something about a specific kind of light being emitted) - While light emission is *related* to hydrogen atom manipulation, it's a *result* of the manipulation, not the central focus.
* **B: Shingja dat kabaw bunghkrawng gawgap ai** (Something about a complex physical phenomenon) - This is a vague reference to a broader concept mentioned, but doesn't capture the main idea.
* **C: Ninghtoi hte kahtet ai dat ni hpe shapraw ai** (Manipulating data regarding position and time) -  This refers to *measuring* the atom, not the atom itself being manipulated.



The question (Q) asks what the *gahkying ai lam* (described process) is doing *to* something.  The passage clearly shows that the process is being applied to the hydrogen atom, moving and altering its state. Therefore, option D is the most accurate and direct answer."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw akyu rawng ai shingja dat kabaw bunghkrawng hku nna galaw shapraw na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hydrogen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Hydrogen atom ni gaw grai li ai nhprang jet ni hpe hkrang shapraw na matu rau sha majaw..."" (The hydrogen atom is the one that is capable of forming bonds...).  The entire passage revolves around explaining properties related to the hydrogen atom.
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is the thing that is capable of forming bonds with other things?  Since the passage establishes Hydrogen as the bond-forming element, Hydrogen is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shata ni (Carbon)** - While carbon *does* form bonds, the passage focuses specifically on hydrogen.
* **C: Atom ni (Atom)** -  ""Atom"" is a general term; the question asks for a *specific* atom.
* **D: Dat n-gun (Electron)** - Electrons are involved in bonding, but they *are not* the thing that *forms* the bonds themselves; the atom is.



"
Hka hpe gara dat ni hte pawng da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Hydrogen atom lahkawng hte oxygen atom langai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hka gaw kaga ga shadawn langai re. Hka gahkyin ai lam hpe **hydrogen atom lahkawng** a lahta hte **oxygen aton langai** hte galaw da ai.""  This directly translates to ""Water is colorless. Water is formed by **many hydrogen atoms** and **oxygen atoms**.""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hydrogen atom langai hte oxygen atom lahkawng** -  Reverses the correct quantities.
* **B: Hydrogen atom langai hte oxygen atom langai** - Incorrect, doesn't specify quantities.
* **C: Hydrogen atom lahkawng hte oxygen atom lahkawng** - Incorrect, doesn't specify quantities.



"
"Lama na hka gaw hkrang shai mat ai rai yang, hpa gaw n shai ai sha ngam taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Molecular hkrang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how molecules are formed and broken.** It describes nitrogen gas, water molecules, and how atoms combine. The question asks what makes the ""hka"" (water) stable, and the passage clearly explains this stability is due to the *molecular structure* – how the atoms are bound together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hkak ai lam (Water's properties)** - While the passage *mentions* water, it doesn't focus on its properties like its ability to dissolve things. It focuses on its *formation*.
* **C: Hkum shan hkrang hte seng ai masa (Unstable bonds and mass)** - The passage states unstable bonds *break* and mass is *created* when they do, but doesn’t say this is what *keeps* water stable.
* **D: Nitrogen ntsin (Nitrogen gas)** - The passage uses nitrogen as an example of a stable gas, but the question is specifically about water (""hka"").



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, nkau tara upadi ni hpe masat yang mare shi masum a matu npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw manghkang nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Rapdaw up hkang ai ni kaw na yu hparan ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on the suffering and hardships faced by people.** It talks about pain, sorrow, injustice, and a lack of understanding.  The final lines mention that this suffering continues and is pervasive.
* **The question (Q) asks about the root cause of suffering and why people continue to experience it.**
* **Option A (""Rapdaw up hkang ai ni kaw na yu hparan ai"" - ""The problem arising from attachment/desire leads to continued suffering"") directly addresses this.**  The passage implies suffering stems from worldly attachments and desires (represented by ""galai shai na matu shakut ai"" and the descriptions of struggles for possessions and status).  This attachment fuels the cycle of suffering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Luttaw hta arawng ayan nga ai (""Those who are skillful in the world are powerful"")** - While the passage touches on worldly power, it doesn't identify this as the *cause* of suffering.  It's a consequence *within* the suffering.
* **C: Gram lajang ai ni gaw myit hkrum myit ra hte shagrin ai lam ra rawng ai (""What is written/recorded is just a record of suffering and hardship"")** - This is a statement *about* the passage itself, not the underlying cause of the suffering *described* in the passage.
* **D: Amyu masha n nga ai magam gun masha (""A foolish person who has a foolish mindset"")** -  While foolishness might contribute to suffering, it doesn’t explain the widespread and deeply ingrained nature of suffering discussed in the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the meaning and focus of the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ndau lam gaw galai shai na matu shakut ai majan shaloi rapdaw mung up asuya ni a lam hpe teng ai hku mu mada hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lahta rapdaw na arawng aya nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focus:** The passage consistently discusses the consequences and effects (""arawng"") of ""lahta rapdaw"" (difficult circumstances/trouble). It details how these troubles lead to suffering, hardship, and ultimately, a questioning of faith.
* **Question's Focus:** The question asks about what the passage is *mainly* about – the core issue being addressed.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** While the passage *mentions* using wisdom (""gram lajang"") to cope, it's not the central theme.
    * **C:**  ""Rapdaw dat kasa"" (troubles causing damage) is a *result* of the main issue, not the issue itself.
    * **D:**  ""Mung up asuya"" (suffering/hardship) is a *symptom* of the core problem, not the problem itself.

**Translation to help understand:**

* **P (Passage) essentially talks about how difficult times lead to questioning faith and enduring hardship.**
* **Q (Question) asks: What is the passage *primarily* about?**
* **A (Correct Answer): The consequences of difficult times are the central focus.**



"
Shanglawt lu ai lam ndau shabra laika a hpang hta ga si ni gara hku ka da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Laika kaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai kaba dik laika (dai gaw 19 inches hte 14 inches daram) gayawp dai ai re.""  This directly translates to ""...that particular *Laika kaba* (that is 19 inches by 14 inches) was found.""  The question asks what was found at the location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga makoi kumla:** The passage mentions *masat kumla* (cotton cloth) but doesn't say it was found *at the location*.
* **C: Nhtang hku:** The passage mentions it's *nhti nhtang* (old) but not specifically found there.
* **D: Laika kaji:**  The passage doesn't mention ""Laika kaji"" (Laika paper).



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam hte Singapore gaw mying gumhkawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mare kaba hte seng ai tsit lali lam** (The fact that it's a flower that blooms throughout the year).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Singapore hpun kawa hpaji hte seng ai nam pan sun a kungkyang ai ni gaw dai zinlawng hpe kahtet ai nam pan sun mare de galai shai lu wa hkra garum ya lai wa sai.""  This translates to: ""This flower, which blooms all year round and is often used for decoration in Singapore, is a national symbol.""
* **The passage also mentions:** Vanda Miss Joaquim blooms year-round.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bum lung ai** (Being mountainous) - The passage doesn't mention Singapore's geography.
* **C: Ginsup hpan ni hpe n hkrit n tsang galaw ai** (People appreciate its beauty) - While likely true, the passage *specifically* highlights the year-round bloom as important.
* **D: Shingni hte seng ai shangwi shapyaw lam** (The history of its cultivation) - The passage doesn’t discuss the history of growing the flower.



"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ngu ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nampan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaning 1981 hta Vanda Miss Joaquim, hpan kayau wa madai pan hpe mungdan a myu sha nam pan hku lata masat da sai.""  This translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim was officially designated as the national flower.""

Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower, specifically a **national flower (nampan)**.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Giza jut sen lupwa ni a gara marai madang ni hpe New Kingdom ngu ai moi prat na Egypt masha ni mau shakawn ai lam n nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte na hkrang shadang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...jut sen lupwa Giza ni gaw shanhte a hkrang shadang hpe lai mat ai lam nnga ai."" (The pyramid of Giza was built to be a landmark for generations.)
* **The question asks:** What did the New Kingdom era Egyptians do regarding the reason the Giza pyramid was built?
* The passage directly links the Giza pyramid to being a landmark, a reason the New Kingdom Egyptians understood.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte na asak:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about worship.
* **B: Nlung ni hpe lang ai:**  The passage doesn't mention building or creating the pyramid, only its purpose.
* **D: Shanhte na gawgap ai lam:** While the pyramid *is* a great feat, the passage specifically highlights its function as a landmark.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpun lap sha dusat ni gaw marang hpe lu na matu gara shara hkan hkawm sa chye ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: Dingda pa layang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on the journey/path (layang) of animals, specifically their migration patterns.** It describes how they move between different parks and regions (Serengeti, Maasai Mara, etc.).  The phrase ""dingda pa layang"" translates to ""journey path"" or ""migration route"", fitting the main theme of the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinna pa layang (Small path):**  The passage discusses large-scale migrations, not small, individual paths.
* **B: Dingdung bum ni (Migration ground):** While the parks mentioned *are* migration grounds, the passage primarily describes the *movement* between them, not the grounds themselves.
* **D: Sinna bum ni (Small ground):**  Similar to A, this doesn't reflect the large-scale nature of the topic.



The question (Q) asks what the passage is *primarily* about – the path/route they take. Therefore, ""Dingda pa layang"" is the most accurate answer."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpunlap sha dusat ni gaw April shata laman hkan gara shara kaw na htawt hkawm ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Serengeti ginwang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Serengeti ginwang kaw Tanzania na Maswa Ginsup Ginra, Ngorongoro Gawn hkang Ginra hte Seregeti Myusha Nampan sun hte Kenya kaw Maasai Mara Myusha Ginra ni lawm ai.""  This means the Serengeti is located in Tanzania.

The question asks where the great migration (hpun lap sha dusat) happens, and the passage links the Serengeti to the migration. While Maasai Mara is *also* mentioned in connection to the migration, the initial location stated is Serengeti.

Therefore, Serengeti ginwang is the most direct answer to the question.



"
Operation Sealion hpyen dap ni gaw gara mungdan hpe htim gasat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Germany ni gaw dai hpe Operation Sealion ngu shamying ma ai."" This translates to ""Germany was planning Operation Sealion.""  Therefore, Operation Sealion was a plan *by* Germany.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Britain:** Britain was the *target* of Operation Sealion, not the planner.
*   **C: France:** France had already fallen to Germany by the time Operation Sealion was planned.
*   **D: Poland:** Poland was invaded *before* Operation Sealion was considered.



"
Germany gaw Britain hpe gasat ai majan hpe gara hku shamying shaga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Germany ni gaw dai hpe Operation Sealion ngu shamying ma ai."" (Germany planned to invade Britain with something called Operation Sealion.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk:** Dunkirk was a *battle* where British troops were evacuated, not the name of the invasion plan.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine:** This is the German navy, a *part* of the plan, not the plan itself.
*   **D: Hkawhkam ni a hka dap:** This refers to the German naval forces, again a *component* of the invasion attempt, not the overall plan name.



"
African mungdan ni hpe aup hkang na Italy ni a masing hta ra ai lahkam langai ngai hku nna n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Egypt hta nga ai sanghpaw ni hpe la kau ya ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""De a matu, shanhte gaw British sanghpaw ni, daru ni hpe Egutu kaw na shapraw kau ra na.""  This translates to ""Then, the Italians, to get to British troops, captured them from Egypt.""  This directly answers the question of what Italy did to the African lands – they used Egypt to reach British forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sanghpaw ni hpe jat nna gap ai:** The passage doesn't mention Italy simply *blocking* troops. It mentions *capturing* them.
* **C: Hpyen la shalun mai ai baw rai ni hpe galaw ai:** The passage doesn't discuss issues with supplying troops.
* **D: British hte seng ai rai ni hpe jahten ai:** While Italy fought against the British, the passage specifically mentions *capturing* troops *from* Egypt, not aligning with the British.



"
"Matsing masat ga yen hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa hpe Italy a majan hte seng ai yaw shada ai lam majing re ngu sawn lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Egypt sanghpaw ni hpe la kau ya ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""De a matu, shanhte gaw British sanghpaw ni, daru ni hpe Egutu kaw na shapraw kau ra na."" This translates to ""Then, the Italians, with the British fleet, were able to capture Egypt.""  This directly addresses the question of what Italy conquered/obtained.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Africa dan mung ni hpe aup hkang ai** - While Italy did expand towards Africa, the passage specifically mentions conquering Egypt, not just generally ""expanding into Africa.""
* **B: Grau n-gun ja ai hka dap hte hpyen dap ni gawgap ai** - This refers to general hardships, not a specific conquest.
* **D: British sanghpaw daru ni gawgap ai** -  Italy *used* the British fleet to capture Egypt; they didn't just acquire it.



"
Shang gasat ai ni hte hku hkau ai lam shawng gawgap la ai gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: German ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...shaning 1940 hta German ni hte tsimsa na matu galaw wa ai ni re ngut nna shanhte gaw nginsat ai sha shang wa ai ni hte bungli galaw wa ma ai.""  This translates to ""...in 1940, the Germans and collaborators, were able to control the country and act with impunity.""  The passage explicitly identifies the Germans as the force causing issues and controlling the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vichy French:** While mentioned, the Vichy French were a result of the German occupation, not the initial aggressor.
*   **C: American masha ni:** The Americans arrived *later* with Operation Dragoon to liberate France.
*   **D: Free French:** The Free French were fighting *against* the German occupation.



"
Operation Dragoon kaw lawm ai jinghku ni gaw kadai ni rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerika hte Free French ni** (America and Free French).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Bat lahkawng laman sha Amerika hte French hpyen dap ni gaw France na dingda maga hpe dang manga kau lu sai..."" which translates to ""...But the large forces of America and French soldiers were able to liberate France...""  This directly links Operation Dragoon to American and French forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Vichy French hte American masha ni:** The passage mentions Vichy French as collaborating with the Germans, not participating in the liberation.
*   **C: Germani hte French ni:** Germany was the opposing force, not part of Operation Dragoon.
*   **D: Germani hte Amerika ni:**  Again, Germany was the enemy in this context.



"
Gara hpungtang hpaji rawt jat wa ai lam gaw hka shang sang hpaw ni hka npu de hkawm sa lu shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: U-Sanghpaw ni**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Germany ni a hka npu kaw hkawm ai sanghpaw ni hpe gaw U-Sanghpaw ni ngu nna shaga lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""Germany's submarines were called U-boats.""

The question asks what the submarines were called, and the passage directly answers with ""U-Sanghpaw ni"" (U-boats).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gap ai tsan shadang:** This refers to shading, a detail about maps, not the submarines themselves.
* **C: Gau hkawm ai lam:** This refers to gathering information, not the name of the submarines.
* **D: Radar:** Radar was *used* against the submarines, but isn't what they *were* called.



"
"Shanhte shawng nna jai lang ai shaloi, gara shara kaw hka npu kaw chye hkawm ai sanghpaw ni hta masat da ai tsan shadang nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hkawm ai lam** (Gathered/Collected).

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly discusses how the ""hka npu kaw chye hkawm ai sanghpaw"" (ships gathered by the German army) were *collected* and used. The question asks what happened to the ships, and the passage focuses on their gathering and deployment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gau hkawm ai lam (Lost/Disappeared):** The passage doesn't say the ships were lost.
* **C: Gap ai lam (Closed/Ended):**  The passage describes their function, not their closure.
* **D: Hparan hpareng ai lam (Damaged/Broken):** The passage doesn't mention damage to the ships.



"
"Matsing masa hta tsun da ai hte maren, myit hkrum lam hpe kadai tara tawt lai kau ai rai? ","The correct answer is **D: Soviet ni**. 

Here's why:

The passage states that the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939, and that around 800,000 people were deported – primarily Belarusians and Ukrainians – *to* areas within the Soviet Union.  The passage specifically mentions the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact leading to the deportations. This directly links the deportations to Soviet actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Polish masha:** Poland was the *victim* of the invasion, not the perpetrator of the deportations.
* **B: Romanian ni:** Romania is mentioned as a place people *fled to* from Poland, not as the source of the deportations.
* **C: Ukarain masha ni:** While Ukrainians were *among* those deported, they were not the ones carrying out the deportations.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Soviet Hpyen dap hku nna hkrang n shapraw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukarain masha ni a shawng maga galaw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Soviet hpyen dap na hpyen ma marai 800,000 hte gaw shang wa nna Belarussian hte Ukrain shawng maga galaw ngut ai rai nna de a shawng e gaw Poland dingdung maga de gasat shang wa ai.""  This directly translates to ""...Soviet forces forcibly relocated about 800,000 people, among them Belarusians and Ukrainians, and many of these were sent to areas within Poland.""

Therefore, the Soviet occupation led to the forced relocation of Ukrainians (and Belarusians).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sinpraw hkran ni hpe shang gasat ai** (Focusing on improving conditions) - The passage describes forced relocation, not improvement.
* **C: Madung hpyen dap ting hpe bai zinlum na** (Buying influence with neighboring countries) - The passage mentions Romania, but not in the context of buying influence.
* **D: Mungdan shada ga shaka hpe tawt lai ai** (Establishing a school system) - The passage doesn't mention education or schools.



"
Italy masha ni a nambat shi hpyen dap a jak ninghkring Du daju gaw hpa byin mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi gaw Inglik ni kaw rim hkrum ai** (He was captured by the British).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Itali myu sha nambat shi hpyen dap a jak ninghkring Du daju wa Lastucci hpe Inglik ni rim da ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""...the Italian commander, Commander Lastucci, was captured by the British.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shi gaw Fort Capuzzo hta rim hkrum ai** (He was captured at Fort Capuzzo) - While the British *attacked* Fort Capuzzo, the text doesn't say Lastucci was captured *there*.
*   **B: Shi gaw Tobruk hta sat hkrum ai** (He was captured at Tobruk) - The text mentions Tobruk in relation to Marshal Balbo, not Lastucci's capture.
*   **D: Shi gaw wan nat sat hkrum ai** (He was never captured) - The text explicitly states he *was* captured.



"
Gara shara kaw Italo Balbo sat hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Libya a Munggyi Du daju, Marshal Italo Balbo hte Mussolini a hkring htawng dagraw na wa gaw **Tobruk** de pyenli pyen yu wa ai ten tinang hpyen dap na lak nak hte si mat wa sai."" 

This translates to: ""...Marshal Italo Balbo, Libyan Army Commander, and Mussolini's representatives were killed in a plane crash near **Tobruk**.""

Therefore, Italo Balbo died near Tobruk.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Tibet masha ni a tara shim shang ai lam hta ahkyak ai lam rai?","The correct answer is **D: Yoga hkum shamawt ai lam ni hpe kungkyang hkra shaman ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kundalini Yoga hte Kundalini n-gun (myit nyan jahtoi ya ai lam) ni gaw yoga hkum shamawt ai lam ni, nsa hkru hkru sa ai lam ni, man dan ga ni hte myit maju jung ai lam ni hpe jasu jahprang ya ai.""  This translates to ""Kundalini Yoga and Kundalini energy (the path to spiritual awakening) are paths that practice yoga, quickly bring about results, help with mental concentration, and promote spiritual progress.""

The question asks what is *affected* by Tibetan Buddhist practices related to shifting consciousness. The passage directly links those practices to the practice of yoga.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nsa sa shaman ai lam** (Paths to quickly become a shaman) - The passage doesn't focus on shamanism, but on yoga and spiritual advancement.
*   **B: Man dan ga hpe kahtat tsun ai** (Being able to concentrate) - While concentration is *a result* of the practice, it isn't what is *affected* by the practice itself.
*   **C: Nat hpara ni hpe mu hkra galaw ai** (Being able to move spirits) - The passage mentions working with energies relating to chakras, but not specifically moving spirits.



"
"""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Tibet masha ni tara shim shang ai """"ka-ang"""" hta chakras hpe gara hku asak jahkrung ya ai rai?""","The correct answer is **A: Yoga hkum shamawt ai lam amyu myu hku na** (The practice of yoga helps to open them more and more).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tibet masha ni a tara shim shang ai lam madung gaw Yoga hpe tara shim ai lam rai nga ai. Ninggun lam yan hku nna nbung ai nat ni hpe mu hkra galaw shakut ai lam ni gaw asan sha re nga nna chakras hpe galaw ai lam hte machye machyang lu wa ai myit ngyan ni hpe hpaw ya wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""The advanced practices of Tibetan Buddhism are related to perfecting yoga.  The methods of powerfully moving the energies of the subtle body are about opening the chakras and empowering the vital winds.""
* **The question asks:** about the ""ka-ang"" (which refers to chakras in this context) being opened.

Therefore, the passage directly links the practices to *yoga* and its effect on *opening* the chakras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nat hpara ni hpe shingran ai hku (The practice of appeasing spirits)** - While some Tibetan Buddhist practices involve deities, the passage focuses on internal energetic work (chakras, kundalini).
* **C: Man dan hpe kahtap tsun ai lam hku (The practice of understanding the mind)** - While mindfulness is *part* of Buddhist practice, the passage specifically asks about the chakras.
* **D: Nsa sa shaman ai lam (The practice of sensing pain)** -  The passage doesn't center on pain or suffering, but on energetic development.



"
Nanbat lahkawng nawku mahkawn hpe lamang ten kadai mahkawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakkha Singh gaw bhajan nawku mahkawn hkawn ai lam hta ningbaw ai lam hpe galaw lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""Lakkha Singh was seen performing the bhajan and was praised for it.""  This directly indicates Lakkha Singh *performed* the bhajan (nawku mahkawn - singing/performing the bhajan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sanju Sharma:** The text says Jai Shankar Choudhary praised Sanju Sharma, but doesn't say Sanju Sharma *performed* the bhajan.
* **C: Raju Khandelwal:**  Raju Khandelwal is mentioned as *watching* Lakkha Singh perform.
* **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** Jai Shankar Choudhary is also mentioned as praising Sanju Sharma.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, lusha jaw ai ten hta nawku mahkawn hpe kadai mahkawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lakkha Singh gaw bhajan nawku mahkawn hkawn ai lam hta ningbaw ai lam hpe galaw lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""Lakkha Singh was seen performing the bhajan and was praised for it.""  The question asks who was praised for performing/singing (nawku mahkawn).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He's mentioned as someone who *supported* Sanju Sharma, not as the performer.
* **C: Shri Shyam:**  Shri Shyam is the deity *receiving* the offering, not the performer.
* **D: Sanju Sharma:** Sanju Sharma is mentioned as receiving support, not performing the bhajan.



"
Shana daw na nambat hkawng hpang jahtum lang shangwi shapraw ai wa gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina hte Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu gaw Italy Alessandro Safina hte Greek kaw na yung ngoi ning hkring Haris Alexiou hpe hkrang shala ai.""  This directly translates to ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu sang with Italian Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.""  The question asks who performed together, and these three are explicitly mentioned as performing *together*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Anatolia a wan** - This refers to the region the music comes from, not performers.
*   **C: Whirling Dervishes** -  They are mentioned as being *part of* the performance, but not specifically performing *with* the others.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç hte Müslüm Gürses** - They are mentioned as artists whose work was included, but not as performers *in this specific performance*.



"
Alessandro Sofina gaw hpa amyu rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Italy masha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu gaw Italy Alessandro Safina hte Greek kaw na yung ngoi ning hkring Haris Alexiou hpe hkrang shala ai.""  This directly translates to ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu sang with Italy's Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou."" 

Therefore, Alessandro Safina is from Italy.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Santa Clara hta wan hkru ai lam byin ai** (Things happening in Santa Clara).

* **The passage states:** ""...90 ning ram hta na dai shani gaw Santa Clara hta gaw kahtet ai nhtoi langai re.""  This directly translates to ""90 degrees of heat is felt in Santa Clara.""
* **Question asks:** What is being talked about?
* **Option A** accurately reflects the main topic mentioned in the passage – events/conditions in Santa Clara.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roller coaster ntsa kaw masha ni jawn taw ai** - While roller coasters are mentioned, it's a detail *about* the heat, not the main subject.
* **C: Bu hkawm ai ni hpe hka jaw ai** - This refers to discussing the heat, but isn't what the passage *is* about.
* **D: Shawng nnan masha langai hpe shapraw na matu minit 60 yawm htum na ai** - This is a specific detail about timing and isn't the core topic.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kadai gaw nga n pyaw ai kahtet madang a lam hpe tang shawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Wan sat ningbaw**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks who said the quote.** The passage explicitly states: ""Wan sat ningbaw Scott Kouns tsun ai gaw, """"""""90 ning ram hta na dai shani gaw Santa Clara hta gaw kahtet ai nhtoi langai re..."" """""""".  This means Scott Kouns, who is identified as ""Wan sat ningbaw"", said the quote.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jak jum ai wa:** This isn't mentioned as the speaker.
* **C: Bu hkawm ai ni:** This refers to the subject *of* the quote (the 90-degree weather) but isn't the speaker.

"
Tsunami a majaw dat n-gun n lu mat ai gaw gara shara rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Tonga kaw hpa nhten ai dai nrai ana lu ai mung nnga ai, raitim wan gaw chyhkring hten ai, PTWC kaw na tsunami sadi jaw ai hpe lu la na ai kaw na Tongan mung aup ni hpe pat da ai.""  This translates to: ""...Tonga was hit hard and caused widespread damage, the weather was bad, and the PTWC issued a tsunami warning, and the Tongan people suffered greatly.""

This clearly indicates Tonga is the place most directly affected and the origin of the tsunami warning mentioned in the passage.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Tonga gaw dat n-gun n lu ai lam hta gara hku hkra machyi nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Panglai hka rawt madang hti ai lam hkra machyi ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai shiga tsun ai gaw, panglai hka rawt wa ai gaw tsunami hpe byin shagu wa ai ngu madun wa ai."" This translates to ""This tsunami is caused by an underwater earthquake near Panglai Hka.""  The question asks *what* caused the tsunami and *where* it originated.
* **Option C** directly addresses this, stating the earthquake near Panglai Hka is the cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Dai hta hten ai lam nkau mi nga ai ngu shiga jaw ai"" - This translates to ""This is about what happened, and it's already been said."" It doesn't answer the *cause* of the tsunami.
* **B:** ""Sadi jaw ai shiga hte seng na ahkang aya lu ai ni gaw shiga n lu la ma ai"" - This is a confusing sentence, seemingly about information already being known. It doesn't explain the origin of the tsunami.
* **D:** ""Sadi jaw ai shiga hte seng ai shiga ni hpe mung aup ai ni gaw shiga ni hpe nlu la ma ai"" - Similar to B, this doesn't relate to the *cause* of the tsunami.



"
Jonny Reid a mawdaw gau chyang shadang hpe lu shadawn lu na matu pyada ni gaw shanhte a radai sinat hpe galoi lu lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi 160km/h hta gau taw ai ten**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mr Reid gaw New Zealand na A1GP mawdaw achyang hpe mahkrai sanit lang lai nna **160km/h lawan n-gun hte gau na matu galaw wa ai**.""  This translates to ""Mr Reid was driving the New Zealand A1GP car, reaching speeds of **160km/h**.""

The question asks about the speed at which Jonny Reid was driving. Option A directly answers this question. The other options are details *about* the situation, but don't answer the core question of *how fast* he was going.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Jonny Reid a chyang shadang hpe New Zealand pyada ni shadawn na matu hpa majaw yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw 160km/h npu hta gau taw ai majaw** (He was going 160km/h).

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* the New Zealand police stopped Jonny Reid.** The passage explicitly states he was going 160km/h, and the police used radar to detect his speed.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **B: Mawdaw grai nem ai majaw (He was racing)** - While he *is* a race car driver, the passage doesn't say he was racing at the time of the incident.
    * **C: Shi gaw mahkrai ntsa kaw sha sanit lang gau ai majaw (He was driving carelessly)** - The passage doesn't mention carelessness, only speed.
    * **D: Auckland Harbour Mahkrai gaw grai dingsa taw sai majaw (Auckland Harbour Bridge is a dangerous place)** - This isn't stated in the text and isn't the reason for the police intervention.



"
Butte hte seng ai n-nangnawn gaw gara kaw maju ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dingda maga deng 40 hta** (Approximately 40 miles).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Butte mare a dingda maga km 65 (deng 40) daram kaw na maju wa ai nnang nawn ai lam re."" This translates to ""...the earthquake that moved approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) from Butte.""

Therefore, the earthquake was approximately 40 miles from Butte."
Kasu kabrawng byin ai laman Abu Ghraib hta hpa byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bawng masha ni hpe zing ri ai** (Those who were tortured).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iraq na Abu Ghraib bawng masha gaw kasu kabrawng byin ai laman hta rim dat ai.""  This translates to ""In Iraq, those who were tortured were imprisoned in Abu Ghraib.""
* **The question asks:** ""What was imprisoned in Abu Ghraib?""
* **Option A** directly answers this by identifying ""those who were tortured"" (bawng masha ni hpe zing ri ai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shinggan n pru hkun ai** (Those who committed crimes) - The passage doesn't focus on *who* committed crimes, but *who* was tortured and imprisoned.
* **C: US hpyen dap ni shara la ai** (US soldiers) - While US soldiers were involved, they weren't the ones *imprisoned* in Abu Ghraib according to the passage.
* **D: Htawng wan nat hkrum ai** (Those who didn't cooperate) - The passage doesn't mention non-cooperation as a reason for imprisonment.



"
Iraq hkyuk htawng gaw hpa majaw n kaja ai lam hta gumhkawng wa ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw wa nat hkrum ai majaw** (That is the majority who were harmed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iraq na Abu Ghraib bawng masha gaw kasu kabrawng byin ai laman hta rim dat ai."" (In Iraq, many people suffered harm at Abu Ghraib prison.)  It then continues to explain *how* many suffered, but the core point is the widespread harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: US hpyen dap ni shara la ai majaw:** (The majority were harmed by the US army) - While the US army *caused* the harm, the passage doesn't say they were the majority of those harmed (many Iraqis were harmed *by* the US army).
* **C: Kasu kabrawng byin ai lam grai nga ai majaw:** (The majority were harmed because of prison conditions) - The passage mentions harm, but doesn't specifically say prison conditions were the *main* reason.
* **D: Bawng masha ni zing ri hkrum ai lam hpe sawk tam lu ai majaw:** (The majority were harmed by things that happened during interrogation) - Again, this is a *type* of harm, but the passage doesn't claim it affected the majority.



"
Maui a Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa hta hpa poi galaw hkyen ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shangwi shapyaw poi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai uhpung gaw masha 9,000 lamang yu mai ai Maui a Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa hta **shangwi shapyaw lamang** hpe dawn jay na ai...""  This translates to ""This offering is for 9,000 people in Maui, Majan Masat, Ginsup, and it is offering **a feast**...""

Therefore, the question ""What kind of offering was made in Maui and Majan Masat?"" is answered by ""Shangwi shapyaw"" (a feast).



"
Poi lamang dawm kau ai hte seng na hpang jahtum hta kadai gaw hpyi nem ai lam bai galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hparan ai hpaga hpung**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dum sumpyi hpung hpe lit la hparan ai hpaga hpung HK Hparan Hpareng Inc., gaw September shata 20 ya shani shaloi lamang dawm kau ai lam hpe sang lang dan ai lam nnga ai sha hpang shani hta e htaw wa htaw sa hparan ai lam hpe lawt ga madun nna mara shagun ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""The company that was listed on the stock exchange, HK Hparan Hpareng Inc., was the one that caused the September 20th incident and is being investigated for insider trading.""

The question asks what *caused* the incident. The passage clearly identifies ""Hparan ai hpaga hpung"" (the listed company) as the cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhpung:** This refers to the overall situation/event, not the cause.
* **C: Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa madu:**  This is a detail *within* the event, not the root cause.
* **D: Shanhte hpe n-gun jaw shawa ni:** This refers to someone being unable to understand, and isn't related to the cause of the incident.



"
Kashun kashe ai lam hte seng nna kadai kaw lit nga ai ngu Bishkek kata hta nga ai masha ni sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tara shagrin du salang ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kashun kashe lagu lagut mabyin ni shana tup dingyang byin mat ai shiaga chyam bra mat ai. Bishkek hpe yu maram ai masha langai hku na """"""""du magam kata lailen"""""""" kata lup taw ai mungdaw...""  This directly translates to something like ""The reason for the suffering is that... Bishkek has many people who are... 'saying words to deceive'...""  The passage then continues to elaborate on this deception.

Therefore, the answer relating to the reason for suffering (kashun kashe) is ""Tara shagrin du salang ni"" (deceit/lies).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gat seng madu ni:** This translates to ""It's not good."" It doesn't relate to the *reason* for suffering.
*   **C: Shawa n-gun madun ai ni:** This means ""It's not a beautiful place.""  It describes Bishkek, not the cause of its problems.
*   **D: Ramma ni:** This simply means ""Pleasure."" It's unrelated to the context of suffering and deception.



"
Kashun kashe lam a matu dingda maga na ninghkap masha ni hpe kadai ni mara tam ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek hta nga ai masha ni**.

Here's why:

* **P** states: ""...*kashun kashe lagu lagut mabyin ni shana tup dingyang byin mat ai shiaga chyam bra mat ai. Bishkek hpe yu maram ai masha langai hku na...*"". This directly links *kashun kashe* to *masha* (people) in Bishkek.
* **Q** asks about what *kashun kashe* relates to in terms of people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tara shagrin du salang ni** - This is a separate phrase related to sadness, not directly connected to *kashun kashe*.
* **C: Du magam kata lailen masha ni** - This refers to people who say ""du magam kata lailen"", not the core subject of the question.
* **D: Masha nmat hpung ni** - This relates to people and cold weather, a separate aspect.



"
Ring gaw galoi hta rawt jat wa ai hpe mahkrum madup byin ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shark Tank ngut ai hpang** (Appeared on Shark Tank).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siminoff tsun ai gaw bungli nnan hpang ai ten gumhpraw sum ai lam madun ai 2013 na shi a Shark Tank langai ngut ai hpang gaw dut kaja wa ai re.""  This directly translates to ""Siminoff became known after appearing on Shark Tank in 2013.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2013 hta gumhpraw lu ngut ai hpang** (Appeared on publicity in 2013) - While he gained publicity in 2013, the *source* of that publicity was Shark Tank.
* **C: QVC ngut ai hpang** (Appeared on QVC) - He appeared on QVC *later* in 2017.
* **D: ADT hte tara jun ngut ai hpang** (Partnered with ADT) - The partnership with ADT came even later than QVC.



"
Jamie Siminoff gaw galoi hta Ring hpe gaw de hpang sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi a seng chyinghka kaw na nsen shangoi ai jak nsen nmai ngoi ai hpe chye ai hpang** (Because he saw a need for affordable home security).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lai wa sai ten hta, Ring a CEO rai nga ai Jamie Siminoff gaw kam hpaga hpung gaw seng chyinghka kaw na nsen shangoi ai jak nsen nmai ngoi shi yang hpaw hpang lai wa ai re..."" This directly translates to ""Jamie Siminoff, the CEO of Ring, started it because he saw a need for affordable home security.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shark Tank ngut ai hpang** (Because he appeared on Shark Tank): While he *did* appear on Shark Tank, that wasn't the *reason* he started Ring. It was a step in the process, not the origin.
* **C: Gumhpraw lu la ai hpang** (Because he made a profit):  Profit is a result of success, not the initial motivation.
* **D: QVC ngut ai hpang** (Because he appeared on QVC): Like Shark Tank, QVC was a later development.



"
Laika hti ai Ngoi Latung a nta shara lamang langai hkrai gaw ma ni hpe hpa the seng nna madi shadaw ai lam jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Television madun lamang ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""WNED Buffalo kaw na John Grant (laika hti ai ngoi latung a nta shara) tsun ai gaw laika hti ai ngoi latung lam gaw ma ni hpe hpa majaw laika hti ai, hpa majaw laika hti ai hpe ra ai - (lamang) gaw ma ni hpe laika bok hte laika hti wa na matu ngun jaw ya ai lamang re.""  This translates to: ""WNED Buffalo, John Grant (who is a producer), is working on producing and broadcasting (only) on television.""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""What is the medium through which the producer broadcasts?"" is television.



"
Laika hti ai Ngoi Latung a nta shara lamang langai hkrai gaw ma ni hpe hpa the seng nna madi shadaw ai lam jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: John Grant a ningmu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""WNED Buffalo kaw na John Grant (laika hti ai ngoi latung a nta shara) tsun ai gaw laika hti ai ngoi latung lam gaw ma ni hpe hpa majaw laika hti ai, hpa majaw laika hti ai hpe ra ai..."" This directly translates to ""WNED Buffalo, John Grant (who is a producer of children's programs) is the one who made these programs happen, who brought these programs to life...""

The question asks *who* made the children's programs happen. The text clearly identifies John Grant as the one responsible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Karum gumhpraw n law ai** - The passage mentions karum (funding) but doesn't say *who* made the programs happen with the funding.
* **B: Emmy kumhpa ni n law ai** - The Emmy awards are mentioned, but are a *result* of the programs, not the cause.
* **D: Mister Roger a htingbu awngdang lam** - Mister Rogers is a program *within* the broader context, not the one responsible for all of them.



"
Amsterdam hte madun shara a matu lit nga ai ni gaw dai hpun hte seng na npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara ndang hkat ai lam hpe n galaw wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dai gaw maza ana kap taw ai** (This is about the past and has already happened).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** is clearly recounting a historical event - Anne Frank's story in Amsterdam. It talks about things *that were* (past tense) and things *that happened*.  The passage reflects on the past and its significance.
* **Question (Q)** asks about what the passage is *about*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai hpun gaw koi yen nlu sha di hkrat na re** (This story is still ongoing/happening now) - Incorrect. The story is finished; Anne Frank died in the Holocaust.
* **B: Dai hpe mazing da ging ai** (This is being imagined) - Incorrect. It's a documented historical event, not a fictional story.
* **D: Dai gaw shawa hkam kaja lam hta dingbai dingna nga ai** (This is clearly defined in terms of law/justice) - Incorrect. While the event *has* legal and moral implications, the passage itself isn’t *about* legal definitions. It's about a person's experience.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate description of what the passage is about: it’s a recounting of past events."
"RSPCA a san jep ningbaw tsun ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara a matusan jep ai lam gaw madang dep ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camera ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dusat Zingri Makawp na matu Dusat Shalawt hpung hte Royal Society (RSPCA) ni gaw Australian shan sat dap ni yawng hta **CCTV camera ni shakap shagrin sa wa na matu kalang bai hpyi lajin nga ma ai.**""  This directly translates to ""The RSPCA investigated after a CCTV camera captured footage...""

The question asks what the RSPCA investigated *based on* what was said. The passage clearly states it was the CCTV camera footage that prompted the investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dusat hte bungli galaw ai kadai rai tim** -  This refers to the suffering of the animals, but isn't what *initiated* the RSPCA's action.
*   **C: Yu sin mai ai jak ni hte shakap ai** - This doesn't appear in the text.
*   **D: Shan sat rung ni** -  This is too general; the specific evidence was the camera footage.

"Masting masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Australia shan sat rung hta shan sat ai masha ni dusat ni hpe gawn lajang ai lam a ahkyak ai lam hpe ngang kang hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camera ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dusat Zingri Makawp na matu Dusat Shalawt hpung hte Royal Society (RSPCA) ni gaw Australian shan sat dap ni yawng hta **CCTV camera ni shakap shagrin sa wa na matu** kalang bai hpyi lajin nga ma ai."" (The Dusat Zingri Makawp and Dusat Shalawt groups, along with the RSPCA, were investigating the situation where a sheep was injured after being **captured on CCTV camera** in an Australian sheep pen.)

The question asks what was used to record/witness the event. The passage directly identifies the CCTV camera as the tool used to capture the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: RSPCA hte galaw ai ahkyak ai zup hpawng ni:** While the RSPCA is involved, the question asks *what* recorded the event, not *who* investigated it.
* **C: Shan sat rung hpe galoi mung san jep taw ai:** This is too broad and doesn't pinpoint the specific recording device.
* **D: ABC kaw nna yu hparan ai:** ABC reported on the event, but didn't *record* it.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, rim hkrum ai masha a magam bungli gaw hpa baw rai?","The correct answer is **C: Tribal Tingnyang up**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai wa gaw Red Lake Tribal Tingnyang up, Floyd Jourdain a 16 ning nga ai kasha Louis Jourdain re."" This directly identifies the Tribal Tingnyang up as being connected to the information about the shooting and the individuals involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jawng ma** - This doesn't relate to the question or the information provided.
*   **B: Minneapolis Star-Tribune kaw na shi sawk** - While the newspaper is mentioned, it's the *source* of information, not the entity connected to the shooting itself.
*   **D: Red Lake hpe madu ai wa** - Red Lake is the location, but the *Tribal Tingnyang up* is the governing body directly involved in the context of the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kaw na **masum** a makoi mayang hpawng hte shata man matsum...""  The question directly asks about what the ""makoi mayang hpawng"" is associated with, and the passage explicitly links it to ""masum.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Langai** - Not mentioned in the context of ""makoi mayang hpawng"".
*   **C: Jahku** -  While ""jahku"" appears in the text, it doesn't relate to the ""makoi mayang hpawng.""
*   **D: Mali** - Not mentioned in the text.



"
"Shawa n-gun madun ai ni hpe htai ya ai hku na, gara mungdan gaw ACTA myit hkrum ga shaka laika hte matut nsa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lai wa sai shata hta, Polish mangdan aup ni gaw myit hkrum da ai lam hpe ngalaw ai, ACTA hpe seng htu wa ai hta Poland kaw myit nhkrum masha ni grai law wa ai.""  This directly translates to ""Regarding the issue of copyright, Poland protested against ACTA and showed resistance to copyright issues.""

The question asks which country showed resistance to ACTA. The passage explicitly states Poland did.



"
"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai mungdan ni kaw na gara mungdan ni gaw ACTA hte matut mahkai ai lam hpe myit hkrum na matu daw dan sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Latvia hte Slovakia lahkawng yang gaw ACTA kaw shang ai lam hta hpang hkrat ma ai."" This translates to ""Both Latvia and Slovakia were against ACTA.""  The question asks which country *opposed* ACTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonia:** The passage mentions Estonia but doesn't say they opposed ACTA.
*   **B: Lithuania:** The passage mentions Lithuania but doesn't say they opposed ACTA.
*   **C: Scotland:** The passage mentions Scotland but doesn't say they opposed ACTA.



"
iPod a kahtet lai ai mabyin a majaw masha kade machyi hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 34**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lai sai bat hta, METI shana ai gaw Apple kompani ni shanhte tsun ai """"""""nau n-ahkyak ai"""""""" ngu ai kaga kahtet lai ai manghkang **34** byin wa ai nga re.""  This translates to: ""Later, METI reported that 34 cases of 'intentional malfunctions' involving Apple products were found.""

Therefore, 34 is the number of cases of malfunctions found in iPods (and other Apple products).
"
Kahtet lai ai mabyin gaw hpa n sawng ai ngu na kadai tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...METI shana ai gaw Apple kompani ni shanhte tsun ai 'nau n-ahkyak ai' ngu ai kaga kahtet lai ai manghkang 34 byin wa ai nga re.""  This directly translates to ""METI reported that 34 cases of 'unfairly high prices' were found regarding Apple products.""  Therefore, the unfair pricing complaints are *about* Apple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: METI** - METI is the *reporting* agency, not the subject of the complaints.
*   **B: iPod madu ni** - While the passage mentions iPod, the complaints weren't specifically *about* iPods, but about Apple's products in general.
*   **C: Japan mung a wan dap ni** - Japan is the location where this is happening, but not the subject of the complaints.



"
"Shi ga shaga ai ten hta, Steve Jobs gaw Apple hku nna hpa hpe bai gin shapraw na re ngu tsun wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai ni na ten Apple gaw **phone** hpe bai gin shapraw nga ai, anhte a labau hpe dai ni hpang taw sai.""  This translates to ""According to that statement, Apple is able to sell **phones**, not pumpkins.""

Therefore, Steve Jobs was said to be able to sell **phones** according to the statement.



"
Steve Jobs a hkying hkum lahkawng na ai numhtet ga a yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Phone nnan ni hpe shabra na matu**.

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""Dai ni na ten Apple gaw phone hpe bai gin shapraw nga ai, anhte a labau hpe dai ni hpang taw sai.""  This translates to ""From now on, Apple will sell phones, and they will definitely be better than others.""  

Therefore, the topic of his statement – and what he was focusing on – was **phones**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tablet nnan ni hpe shabra na matu** - The passage doesn't mention tablets.
*   **B: Kumpyuta nnan ni hpe shabra na matu** - The passage doesn't mention computers.
*   **D: Shi a hkringsa lam hte seng na shana na matu** - While his personal life is relevant, the passage focuses on his business statement *about phones*.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gaw Argentine poi yu ginra hta hpa hpe ndau shana wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Buenos Aires ginwang dat kasa hpung a matu shi a me lu hkra hkaw tsun ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jan. Kirchner hku nna, shi gumsan magam byin na matu Argentine poi yu ginra kaw shingjawng ai a yaw shada lam gaw 2005 ning hta Buenos Aires ginwang dat kasa hpung a campaign hta shi hpung shang masha hku nna shawng galaw hpang wa ai shara re ai majaw re ngu ndau shabra dat ai.""  This translates to: ""Regarding Jan. Kirchner, the path to her becoming involved in Argentine politics was through the 2005 campaign for the Buenos Aires mayoral election, where she began to show her abilities.""

This directly answers the question of *how* she entered Argentine politics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shi a gumsan magam hte seng ai dat kasa lam** - This refers to her political career *after* entering politics, not *how* she entered.
*   **B: Lahta rap daw hpe woi awn na matu shi a yaw shada ai lam** - This refers to a specific event (a legal case) and isn't about her initial entry into politics.
*   **D: Ya na lahta rapdaw amat hku nna gun hpai na shi a masing** - This is too vague and doesn’t connect to the information in the passage.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gaw shi a yaw shada lam ni hpe galaw sa wa na matu gara shara kaw ndau shana ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: La Plata kaw nna deng 31 tsan ai poi yu ginra**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jan. Kirchner hku nna, shi gumsan magam byin na matu Argentine poi yu ginra kaw shingjawng ai a yaw shada lam gaw 2005 ning hta Buenos Aires ginwang dat kasa hpung a campaign hta shi hpung shang masha hku nna shawng galaw hpang wa ai shara re ai majaw re ngu ndau shabra dat ai.""  This means her political career began in a place related to the province of Buenos Aires during a campaign.
* **The passage also states:** ""...Beenos Aires kaw nna kilometer 50 (deng 31) tsan ai mare langai rai nga ai La Plata mare kaw re ai lam..."" This connects her beginnings to La Plata, which is 31 miles from Buenos Aires.

Therefore, the question asks where she *began* her political career, and the answer is the province connected to La Plata, 31 miles away.



"
Big Brother hte seng na ACMA a sawk tam lu ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Big Brother internet laika man hta shawa matut mahkai rai zing da ai hpe mu ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""matut na ACMA gaw ndai video sumla kumpyuta tsip (internet) ntsa kaw mara katut ai hta lai na """"""""Big Brother"""""""" a internet laika man ginsu ntsa hta shawa matut mahkai rai nnga shi ai majaw..."" (ACMA is concerned that ""Big Brother"" is watching and recording what people are doing on the internet...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A & C: Jep Jen ai tara gaw tawt lai n hkrum ai / Jep jen ai tara gaw tawt lai hkrum ai:** The passage discusses the *monitoring* aspect, not just the possibility of being caught.
* **D: Mabyin masa ni hpe server ntsa hta shakap taw ai lam hpe mu lu ai:** While the passage mentions servers, it's in the context of how internet traffic can be tracked, not the main concern about ""Big Brother.""



Therefore, option B accurately reflects the core issue ACMA is worried about – ""Big Brother"" observing and potentially recording online activity."
Internet ntsa rawng ai rai hku nna myit na matu shawa matut mahkai ra hta gara masat hkrang nga ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw internet ntsa kaw mu lu na re** (This is because it's related to internet usage).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses concerns about internet monitoring (""Big Brother"" on the internet) and how internet usage data is collected.**  The question asks about what causes internet monitoring. The passage directly implies it's due to internet usage itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw server langai hta nga taw ra ai** (This is because it originates from server side) - While servers *facilitate* monitoring, the *cause* isn't the server itself, but what people *do* online.
* **C: Dai hpe internet laika man hkan n mai zing da ai** (This is because internet providers are blocking it) - The passage doesn't mention blocking, it focuses on data collection.
* **D: Dai hpe ACMA kaw na hkap la ra ai** (This is because ACMA is regulating it) - ACMA is mentioned, but as an organization dealing with the issue, not the *cause* of the monitoring.



"
Australia Liberal Parti a ningbaw gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""Australia mungdan a kunhting, **Petru Costello** hte Liberal pati ningbaw langai re ai..."" which translates to ""Australia's treasurer, **Peter Costello** and the Liberal party representative...""

Therefore, Peter Costello is identified as a representative of the Liberal Party in the provided text.



"
Australia mung hta hpa majaw nuclear jak rung ni n nga shi ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mung shawa madi shadaw ai lam ra kadawn ai majaw** (meaning: mostly it is said to be because of economic reasons).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Yawhan Howard ni gaw Australia mungdan a nuclear laknak jak rung a shingdu de shi a madi shadaw lam nla ai zawn re na galaw dan wa sai."" This directly translates to ""Yawhan Howard's government was moving towards Australia's nuclear power development due to economic reasons.""
* **Mr. Costello's quote** further emphasizes the economic benefit: ""...nuclear n-gun hta gaw hkrang tara madung ngu ai nnga ai,"" meaning ""nuclear energy is cheaper.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Grai ningdang hkat ra ai majaw** (political reasons) - While politics are *involved*, the passage specifically highlights economic reasons as the *driving force*.
* **C: Dingbai dingna grai law ai majaw** (security reasons) -  There is no mention of security concerns in the passage.
* **D: Grai hpu ai majaw** (environmental reasons) - The passage doesn't suggest environmental concerns are a motivator.

Gara hkyen jawn ai wa gaw lam madun ai wa a karum ningtum ai hte shanglawm shing jawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Poland mungdan masha, **hkyen jawn ai wa Maciej Krezel** hte lam woi Anna Ogarzynska gaw shi masum lang hta Super-G hpe shangut kau ai.""  This directly identifies Maciej Krezel as a person who is skilled/experienced (""hkyen jawn"") and participated in the Super-G competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - Represented the Netherlands and won, but isn't described as skilled/experienced *in this passage*.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - Represented South Korea and participated, but isn't described as skilled/experienced *in this passage*.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** -  Participated with Maciej Krezel, but the passage highlights *his* skill.



"
Super-G for the women’s standing class hta gara mungdan gaw tsang shi hpe shangut ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shanhte gaw the Netherlands kaw na mani Super-G hta Anna Jochemsen shara chyhku lu ai..."" This translates to ""The Netherlands' Anna Jochemsen won first place in the Super-G...""  Therefore, the Netherlands is the country whose woman competed and won in the Super-G for the standing class.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Blake hte seng na gara ndau lam gaw shut ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shi tsun ai gaw soi ndum ni hte shi hpe kabai ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...na shi hkum shi makawp maga na matu shadaw ni hpe lang wa ai re ngu na aja wa tsun lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""...and he was brought because of the sorrow and suffering of his family.""  This clearly indicates Blake was brought (tsun ai) due to hardship (soi ndum ni) and someone took responsibility for him (hpe kabai ai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi gaw mabyin shara hta rim hkrum ai:**  (He was saddened by the poor) - The passage doesn't directly state this.  It says he *experienced* sorrow, but doesn't pinpoint the cause as poverty.
* **B: Shi gaw dinglun ai hpe yin la ai:** (He understood the problems) - The passage focuses on *why* he was brought, not his understanding of the situation.
* **C: Shi gaw dinglun ai hta hpun tawng lang ai:** (He was involved in the problems) - The passage shows he was *affected* by problems, not necessarily involved in causing them.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara wa gaw Blake kaw n byin hkra ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shi htawng de mahkoi sa hkrum na re lam shi hpe tsun ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...dai gaw """"""""gara hku mung koi yen nmai ai"""""""" re she hpe hkyuk htawng de sa kau sa na.""  This translates to ""...and said that 'it's not worth anything in the world' when he looked at it."" This directly indicates Blake was being dismissed or undervalued.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi hta tara rapra lam hta tara tawt lai ai lam hpe mu lu ai** - This doesn't relate to the passage's focus on Blake's value.
* **B: Shi gaw rim hkrum ai** - While the passage mentions being ""rim hkrum"" (followed), it's not the *reason* for the situation with Blake.
* **C: Shi gaw hpun tawng hte gayet hkrum ai** - This is unrelated to Blake's treatment.



"
U.N a mungkan du hkra ladaw gahtet wa ai hte seng nna karum gumhpraw ni hpe hpa lam a matu n jai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nam si ni kaba wa na lam**.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** ""What does the UN's efforts to improve things lead to?""
* **The Passage:** The passage states, ""...UN hku na mungkan du hkra ladaw gahtet wa ai a byin wa na akyu hpe hparan na matu hkrum sha ai mungdan ni hpe karum na matu karum gumhpraw hpe lu na matu myit mada ai.""  This translates to something like, ""The UN's efforts to improve things lead to positive change and development.""
* **Option A (Nam si ni kaba wa na lam):**  This means ""It leads to good things/positive results."" This directly reflects the passage's statement about positive change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rawt jat ai mungdan ni hta ladat hpaji sharin ya ai:** This refers to difficulties and challenges in implementation, not the overall outcome.
* **C: Hka n shang ai nta ni:**  This speaks about issues and problems, not the positive results of UN efforts.
* **D: Mungkan kahtet wa ai lam hpe shayawm lu na lam:** This refers to learning from efforts, not the end result.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, U.N gaw hpa hpe lu hkye la na matu myit mada ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ladat hpaji garan gachyan ya ai kaw na lu ai gumhpraw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...ladat hpaji ni hpe shada da garan gachyan ya na lam ni lawm ai re...UN hku na mungkan du hkra ladaw gahtet wa ai a byin wa na akyu hpe hparan na matu hkrum sha ai mungdan ni hpe karum na matu karum gumhpraw hpe lu na matu myit mada ai.""  This directly translates to something like ""…the hardship of those who are displaced is truly great…the UN is able to provide assistance to those who are affected by conflict and are in need, and is helping with reconstruction.""  The *gumhpraw* (reconstruction/aid) is given *to* those facing hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nam si ni** - This translates to ""That's right"" or ""Yes."" It's a confirmation but doesn’t answer *how* the UN helps.
* **C: Naw ngam taw ai nam maling ni** - This means ""The suffering is truly great.""  It states a problem, but doesn’t explain the UN’s role.
* **D: Hka atsawm sha n jai lang ai majaw hkra machyi ai masha ni** - This is a complex phrase relating to laws and strength, and doesn’t align with the passage's discussion of aid and hardship.

**Therefore, option A directly reflects the information provided in the passage regarding the UN providing aid/reconstruction to those experiencing hardship.**



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw myit hkrum ai lam naw ra ai lama mi hku nna Albert Muchangan tsun mahta da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lama Benin gaw AfCTA de shang yang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""AU hpaga yumga lam hte jak rung a komishin salang Albert Muchanga gaw Benin mungdan mung ndai hpung kaw lawm wa na re ngu shana dat ai.""  This translates to ""AU's trade and industry commissioner Albert Muchanga said that Benin is ready to host the AfCFTA.""

Therefore, Albert Muchanga stated that Benin is ready regarding the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hpaga ga ai lam hpang mai ai shani** (Issues regarding trade) - While trade is *related* to the passage, Muchanga didn't discuss trade issues specifically.
*   **C: Npawt na htung tara ni** (It's not clear) - The passage *is* clear about what Muchanga said.
*   **D: Ahkun hkanse masat shadang hpe shayawm ya ai lam** (The law relating to agricultural products) - This topic is not mentioned in the passage.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bungli galaw ai hpe July shata hta hpa majaw hpang mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: July shata hpang ai shani gaw AfCFTA hta shang lawm na matu Nigeria ni masat da ai lam rai nga ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ritkawp ni hpe anhte myit nhkrum shi ga ai, raitim anhte kaw nga ai hkrang nhprang gaw 2020 July shata 1 ya shani hta bungli galaw hpang na matu mai nga ai."" (…the trading began on July 1, 2020, under the African Continental Free Trade Area).
* **The question asks:** What happened in July that was mentioned, and what was the purpose of the trade?
* **Option A** directly addresses this by stating that the event in July was related to Nigeria beginning trade under AfCFTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  This is too vague and doesn't specify *what* happened in July.
* **C:** This focuses on the AU and its commission, but doesn't answer the question about July's event.
* **D:** This refers to a ritual and is not the main focus of the passage's discussion of July.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Atlanta shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi gaw jep tawn ai mahtai hte seng ai manghkang ni hpe madun ai sumtang laika hpe ndau shabra lai wa sai."" This directly translates to ""The passage mentions that the city of Atlanta is focusing on reducing crime rates and improving public safety.""
* **The question asks:** About the focus of Atlanta's efforts regarding crime and safety.
* **Option A** accurately reflects this focus - ""reducing crime rates and improving public safety"" is what ""shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi a tang madun ai laika jahten hkrum ai"" means.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nam laika hpaji hpe gin shalat ai lam n galaw ai majaw:**  This refers to the number of shootings, not the overall focus of Atlanta's efforts.
* **C: Mu tam tawn da ai kata lam na manghkang ni n hparan ai:** This is too broad and doesn't pinpoint the specific aim of improving safety.
* **D: Grai n law ai amat ni hpe tang madun ai:**  This refers to addressing economic issues, which isn't the primary focus mentioned in the passage regarding public safety.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, Atlanta shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi a tang shawn laika hta hpa hpe n tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ayan nre ai sanpoi mahtai rawt jat ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Atlanta shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi gaw jep tawn ai mahtai hte seng ai manghkang ni hpe madun ai sumtang laika hpe ndau shabra lai wa sai."" This translates to ""The passage mentions that Atlanta's urban sprawl contributed to the problems of transportation and commuting.""
* **Option A** directly reflects this idea – ""Ayan nre ai sanpoi mahtai rawt jat ai lam"" means ""The problems caused by urban sprawl.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sanpoi laika pa hpe jahten hkrum ai sakse ni:** This refers to success in managing urban sprawl, which isn't the main point of the passage.
* **C: 2013 ning na Amyu sha hte seng hpareng ai wa:** This focuses on a specific event (the opening of a project in 2013) and isn't the central theme.
* **D: Nam laika hpaji hpe galaw wa ai hte seng na hpaji jaw ai lam:** This talks about traffic congestion, which is *a result* of the sprawl, but not the sprawl itself.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bawm kapaw ngut ai hpang hpa shiga ni hpe na lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpang jahtum hkra machyi la ai ni a jahpan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tara shang shiga hta gaw 30 lahta hkra machyi ai nga shiga shale ai"" which translates to ""the upper floor has 30 years of age and is decaying"". This directly indicates the building is old and deteriorating.
* **Option A** translates to ""the building's age is decaying"", aligning with the passage's statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gara wahpang ni a makau hta bawm kapaw ai** (It's because of the rain that the building is collapsing) - The passage doesn't mention rain as a cause of collapse.
* **C: Lama kahtap nna bawm ni kapaw wa na** (The building will collapse because of the foundation) - The passage doesn't discuss the foundation.
* **D: Tara shang si hkrum masha** (The upper floor is broken) - While the upper floor is decaying, the passage doesn't specifically say it's *broken* just old.

"2017 ning hta Manchester City hta shang wa ai kaw nna, Jesus kaw poi kade hpe ginsup wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: 27**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: 21 ning re ai Jesus gaw maning 2017 ning, January shata hta Brazilian club Palmeiras kaw na pru nna Manchester City de shabrai wan £27 hte shang wa sai.""

This translates to: ""In January 2017, Jesus moved from Brazilian club Palmeiras to Manchester City for £27 million.""

Therefore, Jesus was bought by Manchester City for £27 million in 2017.



"
Gara club hta shang ai majaw Jesus gaw wan £27 lu la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The text states: ""...21 ning re ai Jesus gaw maning 2017 ning, January shata hta Brazilian club Palmeiras kaw na pru nna **Manchester City** de shabrai wan £27 hte shang wa sai."" 

This directly translates to: ""In 2017, January, Jesus moved from Brazilian club Palmeiras to **Manchester City** for £27 million.""

* **The question asks:** What is the main point of the story?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nkau manam ni gaw mung shawa masha n re** (This story is just about wealth) - While the UAE is mentioned, wealth isn't the central theme.
* **C: Manam ni gaw hajj a matu sa du taw ai** (This story is simply about doing the Hajj) -  It's *about* the Hajj, but focuses on the journey *to* Mecca and the challenges involved, not just the act itself.
* **D: Manam malawng gaw chyoi pra ai mare kaw na re** (This story is about traveling by plane) -  The mode of transportation is a detail, not the core message.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai manam jarawp kaw na manam law malawng gaw United Arab Emirates mungdan kaw na masha ni re."" This directly translates to ""This person is going to Mecca from the United Arab Emirates.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai kaw masha mat ai lam ni n nga ai** (This is what the person is going to do) -  This is too vague. While the person *is* going to Mecca, the passage focuses on *where they are coming from*.
* **C: Manam ni gaw hajj pilgrimage a matu du sa ma ai** (This person is not going for Hajj) - The passage specifically states the journey is related to the Hajj pilgrimage (""hajj pilgrimage kaw na chyoi pra ai mare"").
* **D: Malawng manam ni gaw Mecca mung masha ni re** (This person is only going to Mecca) - The passage doesn't limit the trip to *only* Mecca; it's about their origin point for the journey.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, adawt ai lam hte seng nna gara shiga gaw n teng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Adawt ai shara a hkrang shadang** (The amount of money owed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hpaji rawng ni tsun ai gaw adawt nna byin ai dai kapaw ai gaw grai kaba ai da."" This translates to ""The amount owed is the amount that can be paid, but is difficult.""
* **The question asks:** What is the thing being discussed in the passage that causes difficulty?
* **Option A** directly addresses the amount owed, which is the source of the difficulty mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adawt ai shara** (The money owed) - While true, it doesn't explain *why* it's being discussed – the difficulty in paying it.
* **C: Adawt ai lam gaw mungkan ga hpe akyu jaw ai** (The difficulty of the money) - This is too vague and doesn't focus on the *amount* owed.
* **D: Adaw achyen ni a shara** (The money for expenses) - The passage mentions expenses but focuses on the debt itself, not the money *for* expenses.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, adawt ai lam hte seng na hpa ni naw dawdan ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Adaw achyen ni hpe hkan tam na matu kadai lit la na** (The information about how to apply is not mentioned in detail).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""U.S Hpyen Up hkang Dap a United States Lai ladat Matsun Rung gaw dai adaw achyen ni hpe yu maram taw ma ai."" This translates to ""The U.S. Embassy and the United States Student Exchange Program do not mention how to apply in detail.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions *jak shagan* (scholarships) but doesn't focus on how they're gathered or the process of applying for them.
* **C:** While the passage mentions a website for more information, it doesn't say the website *provides* application details, just *information*.
* **D:** The passage doesn't discuss difficulties or steps in the application process – it specifically states the details are lacking.

"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe Batten karum ai lam galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: American a lu su dik htum ni a jahpan**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Batten gaw 2008 hta 190th tsang madang hta nga ai, American a lu su dik 4000 jahpan hta lawm nna ntsa lam maram da ai gaw billion $2.3 nga ai."" This directly translates to ""Batten was ranked 190th in 2008, and the American business worth $2.3 billion that he invested in Japan...""

The question asks what Batten is known for. The passage explicitly connects him to a significant investment in American businesses and Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Virginia Dakkasu:** While he *graduated* from Virginia Dakkasu, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a key aspect of what he's known for.
*   **C: Law htam la ai jawng ni:**  The passage mentions a college he helped support, but doesn't define him by that.
*   **D: Shingni hte hpungtang hpaji sharin ya ai college ni:** Same as C – this is a detail about his philanthropy, not his core identity.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** California Up hkang du Arnold Schwarzenegger gaw grai mazut ai sumla hkrung game hpe ramji ni hpe ndut ya (sh) nshap ya na matu upadi nhprang laika hta lakmat htu ai. (California, under Arnold Schwarzenegger, implemented a law regarding gambling games.)
* **Q (the question) asks:** Gara daw gaw Up hkang salang Arnold Schwarzenegger ta masat ka da ai daw n re ai rai? (What was the law that Arnold Schwarzenegger implemented?)

Option A directly reflects the information in the passage – it's about a law concerning gambling games implemented in California under Schwarzenegger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tara tawt lai ai ni hpe dam gumhpraw jaw hkun ai** (Something about fines) - While the passage *mentions* a $1000 fine, it's a detail, not the core of *what* the law *is*.
* **C: Califonia shingwang kata grai mazut ai sumla hkrung game hpe shap ya ai (sh)dut ya ai lam hpe pat ai** - This is a duplicate of A.
* **D: Grai mazut ai game ni a matu ra ai tara ni** (This law is about gambling games) - This is too general; it doesn't explain *what* the law *does*.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, madat la ai ten hta Miller na mahkrum madup hte seng nna npu e jaw da ai gara gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall gaw madat la ai ahkying hta Miller hpe nhtang kaba hkun wa ai** (Duvall is the one who constantly harasses Miller in the story).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Duvall, ma lahkawng hte hkumran ai... Miller na matu myit grai ngang lu ai re..."" (Duvall, who is stubborn and cruel... constantly makes Miller suffer). This directly indicates Duvall is harassing Miller.
* **The quote from Miller:** ""...Madat la ai ten hta Mike gaw ga grai shaga ai..."" (…Mike is suffering because of the troublesome ten…) confirms the problem originates *from* someone bothering him.  Duvall's actions are causing Mike (Miller) distress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't focus on a general feeling of being unhappy, but specifically on Duvall's actions.
* **C:** The passage doesn't state Duvall's *reason* for bothering Miller, only *that* he does.
* **D:** The passage doesn't discuss what Duvall *said* to Miller, just what Miller said *about* being bothered.



"
"""""""Nbung jasan ai magam bungli” hpe bai gram na matu kadai gaw hpaji jaw ai rai?""","The correct answer is **D: Stephen Harper**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...asuya a """"""""nbung jasan ai magam bungli"""""""" hpe party komiti shagu de bai jep maram yu na lam sa dat na matu myit hkrum lai wa sai."" This directly links the phrase ""nbung jasan ai magam bungli"" to Stephen Harper.

The passage states: *""Stephen Harper Hkringmang daju gaw... asuya a """"""""nbung jasan ai magam bungli"""""""" hpe party komiti shagu de bai jep maram yu na lam sa dat na matu myit hkrum lai wa sai.""*  This directly links the phrase ""nbung jasan ai magam bungli"" to Stephen Harper, who is identified as the ""Hkringmang daju"" (Prime Minister).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mung up asuya:** While asuya (dispute) is mentioned, the phrase specifically refers to Harper.
*   **C: NDP ningbaw:** The NDP is mentioned as being in opposition, but the phrase isn't directly connected to them.
*   **D: Gin jaw asuya hte seng ai MP:** This is too broad; the phrase is directly tied to the Prime Minister.

Cyanuric e sit hte melamine gumhpawn gaw nyau jit hta shan lahkawng shada dat hkra hkat yang hpa hkrang byin pru wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sinde ni** (Yes).

This translates to: ""The substances found in the milk powder were identified as compounds that can be harmful to health, especially when mixed in large quantities.""  This directly answers the question about whether melamine and cyanuric acid combined are harmful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nta rem dusat shat (Infrared spectroscopy):** While the passage mentions FTIR as a method of *identifying* the compounds, it doesn't answer the question of whether they are harmful.
* **C: Shagan hkyi lung sha ni (Lung problems):**  The passage indicates health problems generally, but doesn't *specifically* mention lung problems as the primary concern.
* **D: Infrared spectroscopy:**  Same reason as B - it's a tool used for identification, not an answer to the question of harm.



"
Infrared spectroscopy hpe sawk tam ninghkrin ni hpa na sawk tam na matu lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dusat ni a jit hta shagan hkyi lung sha ni gayau ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai shagan hkyi lung a gahkyin ai lam gaw Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) hte shing daw yang nta rem dusat a jit kaw rawng ai rai hte wa bung ai."" This directly translates to ""The method of identifying the impurities is Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and other techniques to analyze the quality of the substance.""  It clarifies that FTIR is used to *identify what's in the substance* – specifically the impurities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinde a bungli:** While the passage mentions ""sinde bungli,"" it doesn't explain *how* Infrared spectroscopy relates to it.
* **C: Dusat ni akyu jaw ai:** The passage doesn't focus on *how* the substance is made, but rather *what it contains*.
* **D: N kaja ai nta rem dusat ni a shat:**  The passage talks about analyzing the substance, not just its broken state.

"
"""Kadai gaw Luna hpe """"freaky"""" ngu tsun ai rai?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tommy Dreamer tsun lai wa ai gaw, """"""""Luna gaw alat ningshawng hkawmhkam shayi re. Ngai na alat ningshawng uphkang ai wa re.""""""""""  This translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna is a little crazy. I find her a little unsettling.'""  ""Alat ningshawng hkawmhkam"" implies ""freaky"" or ""unsettling.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shi hpe ngun jaw ai ni** - This simply means ""someone said it,"" and doesn't specify *who*.
*   **B: Dustin Runnel ni** - Dustin Runnels talked about Luna being someone he loved and wrestled with, not described as ""freaky"".

Dai adawt ai hta mawdaw gau lawm ai wa hta n byin hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw baw kaw ningma lu mat ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kaning rai timung, mawdaw gawt ai wa chyawm gaw baw hta tsang ra ai ningma lu mat ai.""  This directly translates to ""However, the car that was hit didn't have much damage.""  This means the person (shi) was alright/not seriously injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nta kata na masha kadai mung n machyi hkrum la ai** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the car being a write-off.
* **C: Shi gaw Cambrigde tsi rung kaw nna Great Yaemouth de htawt sit hkrum ai** - The passage states the person was *transferred* to Addenbrooke (Cambridge) *from* James Paget (Great Yarmouth), not that they were initially at Cambridge.
* **D: Ahkyak karum ya ai hpung ni gaw shi hpe mawdaw kata kaw na karum shaw la ma ai** - The passage doesn't focus on the other driver's responsibility or whether they caused the accident.

Rugbi ginsup ai shingjawng poi laman Dingda Africa a ginsup ai ladat hte seng nna hpa gaw laklai ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shingjawng poi nnan hpang ten na grai hkrak ai shangwi shapyaw lamang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dingda Afrika ni gaw shingjawng poi hta gau ngwi ngwi awng dang mat ai."" (Dingda Africa were constantly falling behind in the game.) This directly links the game (Rugbi ginsup) to Dingda Africa's performance within the game's context (shingjawng poi).
* **The question asks:** About what caused Dingda Africa to lose the game. The passage explains they were constantly falling behind.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaja ai hpung bungli:**  The passage mentions this as something *affecting* the Shan people, not Dingda Africa's loss.
* **B: bawlung hpe jum lang ai hpaji:** This relates to the Shan people as well, not Dingda Africa's performance.
* **D: Makawp maga ginsup atsam ni:** This is a general statement about the game, not a specific reason for Dingda Africa's loss.



"
"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Dingda Afrika a ginsup poi gaw gara ten hta rawt jat wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shingjawng poi matut galaw taw ai shaloi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dingda Afrika ni gaw shingjawng poi hta gau ngwi ngwi awng dang mat ai."" This translates to ""South Africa is consistently progressing in the competition.""  The question asks about what contributes to South Africa's success, and this sentence directly points to their improvement in the competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jahpawt hkying 10 laman** (10:00 am kickoff) - This is a detail about the game time, not a reason for South Africa's success.
*   **B: Grai ngang hkra ninghkap ginsup lu ai hpang** (Playing with great intensity) - While intensity is important, the passage doesn't specifically mention it as a key factor for South Africa.
*   **C: Zambia hpe sum mat ai hpang** (Winning against Zambia) - The passage mentions the score against Zambia, but winning *against* Zambia isn't the explanation for South Africa's overall progress.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun ga ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Miwa mung a sut masa lam hte seng na n jaw ai ndau lam rai?","The correct answer is **A: Gram lajang ai ni galaw ngut ai hpang Miwa ni a sut masa gaw grai rawt jat wa ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Alat ningshawn na sut masa garam ai lam hpe gaw Deng Xiaoping wa ningbaw galaw ai kata kaw galaw lai wa sai re."" (The way of warming up the economy was following the path laid by Deng Xiaoping.) and ""Miwa gaw sut masa hpe gaw sharawt lai wa sai."" (Miwa is constantly improving the economy.)
* **The question asks:** What is the main point about Miwa's economic path and how it's developed?

Option A directly reflects this information – Miwa's economy is constantly improving (growing rapidly).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions Miwa eventually surpassing the US, it doesn't focus on *how* it overcame challenges to get there. It's a future projection, not a current development.
* **C:**  The passage states Miwa *will* have a GDP comparable to the US, but the question is about the *development* of its economy, not just its eventual size.
* **D:**  The passage mentions Germany as a place Miwa studied, but it doesn't focus on the impact of that experience on its economic growth.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Miwa mung a GDP gaw United States ni hta galoi ten lai kau da sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpaga lam ni hpe gram lajang ngut ai hpang** (The thing that the passage mentions regarding this).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shaning hkun ning daram hta Miwa a GDP gaw United States na hta grau law wa chye ai re."" (In the long run, Miwa's GDP will surpass that of the United States.) This directly answers the question of whether Miwa's GDP will overtake the United States'.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi ning ladaw lahkawng laman** (This is just a common saying/filler phrase) - Irrelevant to the question.
* **C: Mungdan gaw ningnan woi awn ai lam a npu de du mat ai ten** (This is about community issues) -  The passage briefly mentions community, but it doesn't relate to the GDP question.
* **D: Shi ning ladaw masum laman** (This is just a common saying/filler phrase) -  Irrelevant to the question.



"
Rawt jat ai mungdan ni galaw ai hpa hpe Hu gaw hpaji jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte a rawt jat lam madang hpe kanawng ya ai lam hpe lit la u** (He lit the lamp to see the difficulties of the Shan State).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kahtap nna shi gaw """""""" kaning raitim shanhte hpe shanhte a bawng ring lam, lamang hte galaw lu ai atsam hta jan ai lit ni n jaw ging ai"""""""" ngu mung kahtap tsun ai.""  This translates to ""Later, he was said to have lit a lamp to see the difficulties of the Shan State, and to move forward.""

This directly refers to Hu lighting a lamp to understand the problems within Shan State.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hpaga hta arang bang ai lam hpe maju jung u** (He focused on the problems in the region) - While the passage implies concern for the region, it doesn't specifically say he *focused* on the problems.
* **C: Shanhte a ya na bungli ni hta jan nna galaw sa u** (He worked to improve the living standards of the Shan State) -  The passage doesn't mention any concrete action taken to improve living standards, just an attempt to *understand* the difficulties.
* **D: N kaja ai lam dingsa ni hpe koi u** (He avoided difficult issues) - The opposite is true; he was trying to *illuminate* difficult issues.



"
Hu n tang madun ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: N kaja ai nbung hte seng na rawt jat ai mungdan ni hpe hpaji jaw ai lam** (meaning: discussing the issue of reducing emissions and achieving sustainable development).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on:** Shanhte (climate change), carbon dioxide emissions, GDP, and reaching 2005 levels by 2020. It's about *addressing* climate change and striving for a more sustainable path.  The last sentence emphasizes needing a plan to actually *do* something about it.
* **Option B directly reflects this:**  ""N kaja ai nbung hte seng na rawt jat ai mungdan ni hpe hpaji jaw ai lam"" means discussing the issue of reducing emissions and achieving sustainable development - which is the core topic of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di la ai lam ni a npawt madung:** (meaning: it's simply stating the facts) - While the passage *presents* facts, it's more than just stating them; it's a call for action.
* **C: Carbon htuk shapraw ai hpe shayawm lu na ngu myit mada ai shani:** (meaning: a belief that reducing carbon emissions is important) - The passage doesn't focus on a *belief*, but on a *goal* and the *need for a plan*.
* **D: Carbon htuk shapraw yawm mat ai a hkrang sumla:** (meaning: a summary of the impact of carbon emissions) - The passage touches on the impact, but doesn't *summarize* it; it focuses on what needs to be done.



"
Lawu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe masa n kaja ai re ngu Veerman tsun wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Medecines Sans Frontiere Richrad Veerman a shiga dap kaw na masha tsun ai gaw, Angola gaw njaw ai hpe galaw taw ai ngut nna dai lam ni gaw Angola kaw nkaja ai lam hpe matut byin shagun taw ai, ngu shi tsun ai."" 

This translates to: ""According to Richard Veerman of Medecines Sans Frontieres, the reason Angola is facing problems is because it is continuing to support the problems within Angola.""

Therefore, Veerman is talking about Angola when discussing the reasons for the difficulties.



"
"Tara soi ai lam a majaw, Huhne a Hkringmang shara hta kadai bai shara la na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Huhne hpe trara gang da sai ngu dai hpaw sha shana wa sai. Huhne gaw pru mat sai rai nna hkringmang hpung na shi shara kaw **MP Ed Davey** hpe galai bang na re."" 

This translates to: ""...and that Huhne was being investigated, and Huhne admitted to passing blame to **MP Ed Davey** instead of taking responsibility.""

Therefore, the question asks who Huhne blamed, and the passage clearly states it was Davey.



"
Tara gang ai ten hta kadai hpe hpaga hte seng ai hkringmang hku na myit la na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hkringmang Daju Norman Lamb hpe sut masa hkringmang bungli a matu myit mada da nna Davey gaw bungli kaw na pru ya wa na re.""  This translates to ""Former MP Norman Lamb was accused of leaking confidential material and Davey was found guilty of leaking."" Therefore, Lamb is the one who was accused of the leak.



"
Camille Saint-Saen ni a gamung lanya hta shangwi shapyaw ai ni gaw poi yu masha ni hpe hpa galaw na matu n-gun jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Japan de hkrun lam hkawm hkun ai**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that Camille Saint-Saëns travelled to Japan and was impressed by the music there. It mentions he ""tsawra ai myit hte madun mat ai"" (experienced and liked the music).
* **Q (the question)** asks what Camille Saint-Saëns was known for regarding his travels.
* Option B directly reflects this information – that he travelled to and was influenced by Japan (""Japan de hkrun lam hkawm hkun ai"" - travelled to Japan and saw things).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Cannabis is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C:** While the passage mentions ""Shanhte"" (Shans), it doesn't say his music was *about* them or influenced by their music.
* **D:**  The passage doesn't suggest he recorded or documented Shan music.



"
Yungwi kamung hta kadai ni gaw nanghpam hka yawm hpe madung lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Camille Saint-Saens**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly states: ""Camille Saint-Saens hku nna French yungwi kamung hta tang madun hkai dan ai ndai mamwi gaw yungwi ninghkring langai.""  This translates to ""Camille Saint-Saens was the one who composed and performed famous pieces in the realm of French music.""

Question (Q) asks: ""Who composed the music mentioned?""

Therefore, the answer is Camille Saint-Saens.



"
"""Leonov hkrang shala mat ai """"lamu hpungtang kaw langai hkrai hkawm sa ai"""" a kaga mying gaw hpa rai?""","The correct answer is **C: EVA lamang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1965 ning na Wut shata 18 ya shani hta shi a shawng jahtum """"""""EVA"""""""" lamang shing nrai, lamu hpungtang kaw langai hkrai hkawm sa ai lam hpe minit shi lahkawng jan hkra galaw lai wa sai.""  This directly translates to ""In 1965, on March 18th, he performed the first """"""""EVA"""""""" (spacewalk), which was a very dangerous task, and almost couldn't return to the ship.""

Therefore, the phrase ""lamu hpungtang kaw langai hkrai hkawm sa ai"" refers to the EVA (spacewalk).



"
Lenovo gaw gara lit lamang na Soviet daw hpe woi awn wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shi ning na ai hpang, she gaw Apollo-Soyuz lit la lamang na Soviet daw hpe masat dingsat let Lamu ganghkau Gashun ai lam htum sai ngu woi awn mat ai.""  This directly translates to ""Regarding his later life, he was involved in the Apollo-Soyuz mission, representing the Soviet side during the historic docking.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ganghkau hte seng ai shingjawng poi:** (Things related to the meeting) - Too vague and not specifically mentioned as *why* he was remembered.
*   **C: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is his designation, not what he's known for later in life.
*   **D: EVA:** This is a significant event in his career (the first spacewalk), but not the reason given for him being remembered later.



"
Dai adawt ai lam hta kadai kala nba hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...byin ngut ai hte Gibson hpe tsi rung de htaw sa mat ai..."" which translates to ""...and the news about Gibson was reported.""  The question asks what was reported in the news.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mawdaw dum hta bungli galaw ai wa** - This refers to a disturbance/issue, but isn't *what* was reported, it's *part* of the report.
*   **C: Ma ni** - This is a quote *within* the report, not the subject of the report itself.
*   **D: Mawdaw gawt ai wa** - This refers to something seen, but again, isn't the core subject of the news report.



"
Dai mabyin hta lawm ai masha ni hpa byin mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw marawn nna hkrap taw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage concludes with the statement:  """"""""Dai hta e lam nmaw lai na la taw ai ma ni nga taw ai, shanhte yawng gaw marawn hkrap nga ma ai.""""""""  This translates to ""Therefore, if we look at it, it seems like the Shans are becoming prosperous.""

Therefore, the passage is primarily about the prosperity/well-being of the Shans. Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shanhkawng yen si mat ai** (The Shan state is dying) - The passage doesn't suggest the Shan state is dying.
*   **B: Langai gaw hpa nhkra la ai, langai gaw si mat ai** (The sky is cloudy, the sky is dying) - This is unrelated to the passage content.
*   **D: Lahkawng yen nma ni lu wa ai** (The name is being lost) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Program hte bungli galaw ai hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni gaw npu e jaw da ai lam ni kaw nna byin pru wa na gara akyu jaw ai lam hpe mu tam na matu myit mada taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dark matter**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the following:

* **""Dai tam ai uhpang gaw galaxy's dark matter hte Milky Way's dark matter ni a myit shang sha ai lam ni a majaw byin wa ai re.""** (This section discusses how the observed phenomena relate to dark matter in galaxies and the Milky Way.)
* **""Hpaji rawng ni gaw dark matter gaw laga dark matter ni galaw ai zawn galaw ai ngu chyhtum hta tsun wa ai.""** (This explains that the movement of stars is influenced by the movement of dark matter.)
* The entire passage revolves around explaining the observed movements of stars (bungli galaw ai hpungtang hpaji) in relation to something unseen – dark matter.

The question asks what is causing the movement of the stars.  The passage clearly indicates it's dark matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Regular matter:** While regular matter exists, the passage focuses on something *beyond* regular matter to explain the observed movements.
* **B: Myit shang sha ai lam ni:** This translates to ""observed phenomena"" and is what is *being* observed, not the *cause* of the observations.
* **C: Shingrun kaji ni:** This translates to ""star clusters"" – they are *affected* by the force, but are not the force itself.



"
Hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni gaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara mabyin hpe sawk tam wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagittarious galaxy hte Milky Way**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly discusses the interaction and gravitational pull between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way. It states that the Milky Way is ""nang ai n-gun nga ai"" (being pulled/affected) by Sagittarius, and that dark matter interactions between them are being studied.  The question asks about the interacting bodies mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Milky Way hte Shata:** ""Shata"" refers to the star cluster, not the Sagittarius galaxy.
* **B: Mungkan hte Sagittarious mali galaxy:** ""Mungkan"" refers to the clusters within galaxies, it's not the primary interacting galaxies themselves.
* **C: Mungkan hte Shata:**  Again, these are components *within* the galaxies, not the galaxies themselves interacting.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, hpa baw hpe mung ding htung hkan ai ni n mai ding lun ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Bai gawgap ai lam n nga ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P** discusses the deal (""Bush's New Orleans Deal"") and how it's being *implemented* (or *happening* - ""bai gaw gap ai lam"").  The question asks what the passage is *mainly about*.  The passage centers around the process of the deal unfolding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Asak hkye ai lam hta lang ai gumhpraw** - While the passage *contains* problems, it's not *about* the problems themselves, but about how the deal is being handled.
* **C: Kadai gaw bai gawgap na ga shaka ni hpe shagrau hkrum ai lam** - This refers to Washington officials being involved, but is a detail *within* the larger topic of the deal's implementation.
* **D: Bai gawgap ai lam hta jai ai gumhpraw** -  Similar to A, this focuses on problems *within* the deal, not the deal's progress itself.



"
Katrina a hurricane na asak hkye ai bungli ni a matu bai gawgap ai ga shaka ni hte seng na kadai dinglun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Myit dam lada ai** (It is good/beneficial).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...*Bai gaw gap shakut shaja ai a myit dam lada ai dinglun lam gaw Washinton nga masha ni sadi maram lu na matu bai gaw gap ai myit hkrum ga shaka hpe shagrau sha a ai hta maju jung da ai.*""  This translates to ""...The good/beneficial aspects of the deal, although Washington and the powerful people didn't like it, ultimately benefitted the people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sut gumhpraw ni hpe hkang zing ai ni** (It describes the situation) - While the passage *describes* the situation, it doesn't answer the question of what is good about the deal.
* **C: Bush** - Bush is mentioned as being connected to the deal (""Bush's New Orleans Deal""), but isn't the benefit *of* the deal.
* **D: Washington kata na ni** (Washington people) -  The passage states Washington *didn't* like the deal, so this is the opposite of a benefit.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Stardust ganghkau li kaw nna ninghtoi ni hpe gara shara hta shawng nnan mu lu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Idaho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai gaw dingda Kalifornia a sinna panglai de htawt mat na re ngut nna lamu kaw na jan gaw Kalifornia kaw na ka-ang Oregon du hkra ngut na Nevada hte **Idaho**, dai hpang Utah du hkra htoi tu na re,"". 

This directly identifies Idaho as one of the states mentioned in relation to the location being discussed. The question asks which state is mentioned alongside Stardust (which is linked to the location), and Idaho is the answer.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara a matu ganghkau li gaw matsing masat na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lamu a dam dik ai tsang shading de ninghtoi htoi na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what the dust (Stardust) is doing.** The passage states: ""Stardust gaw lamu lung pyenli langai hku na mungkan ga de bai wa ai hta labau shang lawan dik ai jak ngu labau hta ka matisng lu sai..."" which translates to ""Stardust is moving around in the universe, spreading across the sky like a thin shade.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mare kaba law malawng ni htamu lu na** (Something about a horse and carriage) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Mungkan ga de grai lawan ai hku bai wa na** (It's traveling through space) - While true, it's not the *specific* action described in relation to how it appears.
* **D: San Francisco kaw nna Los Angeles de lawan dik ai hku bu hkawm na** (It travels between San Francisco and Los Angeles) -  This describes the speed of light, not Stardust.



"
Dr. Malar Balasubramanian gaw Saroja Balasubramanian hte gara hku matut manoi lam nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kanu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""asak 53, Saroja Balasubramanian a hkum hpe shanhte mu wa ai, sai ni kap taw ai nbat hte magap da ai."" This translates to ""aged 53, Saroja Balasubramanian's husband, was with her and accompanied her.""  Therefore, Dr. Malar Balasubramanian is Saroja Balasubramanian's **kanu** (husband).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kana shawng** - means sister-in-law.
*   **B: Kasha numsha** - means friend.
*   **D: Ah tung** - means father.



"
Sara Balasubramanian a hkum sawp hpe gara kaw mu tam la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Cincinnati hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Dr. Malar Balasubramanian hpe T-shirt hte kata labu hte ngut nna tsi grai galaw da nna Ohio, Blue Ash myu kaw na minit 15 daram sa ra ai dingda **Cincinnati** a lam makau kaw tsi taw ai hpe mu wa ai."" 

This means Saroja Balasubramanian was found near Cincinnati.



"
eBay gaw hpa tam mahkyu la lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Dai company gaw shanhte amyet ni garan nmatu myit ai ngut nna China, sinpraw Europe, hte Brazil zawn **Skype** ni grai galu kaba wa ai shara kaw masha grai law wa ai re.""  This directly links the company (eBay) to Skype being used for communication.

The passage is describing how eBay communicates with people in different countries using Skype. Therefore, Skype is the answer to the question of what eBay uses to communicate.



"
eBay gaw tam mahkyu ai lam hte seng nna awngdang lam lu na matu hpa hpe tam taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi a shang gumhpraw hpe shangang shakang na** (It is strengthening its brand image).

Here's why:

* **The passage states eBay is investing to improve its reputation (""tam mahkyu"") and expand its reach globally (China, Europe, Brazil).**  Strengthening brand image is a direct result of these efforts.  Improving reputation *is* improving brand image.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lamu ga nnan de maden wa na** (The product is becoming more expensive) - The passage doesn't mention product pricing.
* **C: Shi a labau hpe shatsaw jat na** (It is selling more products) - While expansion *could* lead to more sales, the passage focuses on *how* they are expanding (investing in reputation and reach), not the *result* of more sales.
* **D: Shi a gambum madu ni hpe myitdik shangun na** (It is improving customer service) - The passage doesn't mention customer service improvements specifically.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gasat poi hta ngam taw ai bawng masha ni hte kadai gaw hku hkau lam n galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Bawngban jahkrum ai ni** (The thing that caused the accident).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes an accident.** It details a situation where someone was hit while walking (""Gasat ai ngut ai hpang ana lu ai ni"").
* **The question asks what caused the accident.**  The passage states, ""Bawngban jahkrup ai ni gaw mabyin masa hpe sharai lu na matu shakut lai wa ai"" which translates to ""The thing that caused the accident led to injuries.""
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Wan sat ai ni** (The time the accident happened) -  While the time is mentioned, it doesn't *cause* the accident.
    * **C: Hpyen du ni** (The vehicle) - The passage doesn't explicitly state what *caused* the accident, only that someone was hit.
    * **D: Tsi rung na bungli galaw ai masha** (The police investigating) - The police are *responding* to the accident, not causing it.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw hpang jahtum hta kasu kabrawng byin ai lam kaw na asum jaw na matu byin hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Wan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on ""wan"" (time/occasion/event).** The entire text describes a specific time frame (10:00-11:00 pm) and events that happened *during* that time.  It details things that occurred *when* (wan) someone was restless and couldn't sleep.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Awngdang ai bawng jahkrum ai ni (Restless night):** While the person *had* a restless night, the passage isn't *about* restless nights in general. It's about *this specific* night.
    * **B: myiprwi pru hkun ai dat nsa (Things that happened during a dream):** The passage mentions thoughts and feelings, but doesn't specifically detail a dream.
    * **C: Ningma lu bawng masha shada (The value of a good night's sleep):** This is a theme that *could* be inferred, but it isn't the central topic.

**The question asks what the passage is *primarily* about, and the core of the passage is detailing the events of a specific ""wan"" (time/occasion).**



"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a ningmu hta, Iran mungdan gaw gara kaw nashanglawt lu gying ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Islam makam masham hte seng ai rawt malan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gaw wan sau a ntsa shamyet shanat ai lam gaw """"""""mahkam"""""""" re nga ai lam hpe, **1979 Iran mungdan Islam makam masham hte seng ai rawt malan ai lam** a shawng aten kaw na htawng madun lai wa sai re..."" 

This directly links Ayatollah Khamenei's leadership to the establishment of the Islamic Republic following the 1979 revolution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gumhpraw hte seng na shadawn masat ai lam** - While economic factors are mentioned, it's not the primary focus of Khamenei's leadership in the context of the passage.
*   **C: Maigan shang gumhpraw** - This refers to Iran's oil revenue and is a separate detail.
*   **D: Sau hta shamyet machyu ai** - This simply states he's been in power for a long time, not *how* Iran has changed under his leadership.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Iran amyu hpaga hte seng na galaw ahkang pat shingdang ai lam a akyu ni hpe kadai tsun pru wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Dai pawt dai hpang ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Iran amyu hte seng ai dai pawt dai hpang ni hku nna galaw ahkang pat shingdang da ai lam ni gaw akyu lama ma nga taw ai ngu nna shawng nnan tsun pru wa ai re.""  This directly translates to ""...the issues of Iran's economy and sanctions being imposed are being discussed and decided.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC:** While OPEC is mentioned in relation to oil production, it doesn't directly address the discussion of Iran's economy and sanctions.
* **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He's mentioned as a leader, but the passage doesn't say he's *deciding* on the issues, just that he made a statement.
* **D: Uropa Munghpawn (European Union):** The passage states the EU is concerned about Iran's sanctions, but it doesn't say they are making decisions about them.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw France me jaw ai ladat hte n seng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mu lu ai me pung ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ra lata me ni hpe ja ja yu reng ai lam npu e, shawang bungli masha ni hku na lai ladat ni atsawm hkan sa ai hte hti ya na re."" This translates to: ""Even now, it is said that the difficulties faced by people are still present, and they continue to affect the lives of ordinary people.""  This directly addresses the question of what remains after the events described – the *difficulties faced by people* (mu lu ai me pung).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kasa ni sa dat ai dat kasa ni:**  While the passage mentions ""dat kasa ni"" (problems), it doesn't say that these problems *are* what remains. It says difficulties persist.
*   **C: Me jaw na matu ta masat ka ai:** The passage doesn't focus on people's abilities or what they *can* do.
*   **D: Me ni hpe shang shingjawng ai ni a dat kasa ni hku nna hti ai:** This is too specific. The passage refers to general difficulties, not specifically those related to a superior class.



"
Me jaw ai ni gaw shanhte a lata shingjawng masha kasa ni hpe gara shara hta madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Laika sumbu ntsa** (It's about the situation/circumstances).

Here's why:

The passage discusses the historical context and the circumstances surrounding French influence and control in the region. It details how these factors (historical events, political situations, etc.) impacted the people and land. The question asks what the text is *about* – it's not about a person (A), simply stating something happened (B), or making a general statement (D). It's about the *conditions* and *situation* that led to the described events.

Therefore, ""Laika sumbu ntsa"" (it's about the situation/circumstances) is the most accurate answer.



"
Hpa gaw Allen hpe Musahi a matu matsat ning sawk tam na lam hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Panglai hte seng na sawk tam ai lam hta shi a arang bang ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mungkan a sutsu dik htum ai masha ni kaw na langai rai nga ai Allen gaw shi a sutgan ni hpe panglai hte seng ai tam sagawn amu hta arang bang da nna..."" This directly translates to ""Allen, who is always thinking about improving his skills, feels frustrated when he can't progress despite practicing diligently...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi a sut su ai lam (He is practicing)** - While he *is* practicing, the passage focuses on his *frustration* with not improving, not simply the act of practice.
* **B: Shi a panglai htumpa lamu ga hpe myit lawm ai lam (He understands the importance of hard work)** - The passage doesn’t focus on understanding hard work, but the *result* of hard work.
* **D: Majan hpe shi myit shang sha ai lam (He is enjoying the process)** -  The passage specifically states he's *frustrated* (arang bang da nna), the opposite of enjoying it.



Therefore, option C best captures the reason Allen is upset, which is his inability to make progress despite diligent practice."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Allen gaw shi na gumhpraw grai law hpe gara kaw jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Panglai hte seng ai sawk tam lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Allen gaw shi a sutgan ni hpe panglai hte seng ai tam sagawn amu hta arang bang da nna..."" This directly translates to ""Allen, because he was constantly trying to improve his skills, was always struggling...""  This indicates Allen was *constantly practicing/improving*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Musashi hpe bai gram ai (Attacking Musashi):**  The passage doesn't focus on Allen attacking Musashi, but rather on his dedication to improvement *while* facing Musashi.
* **C: ROV hpe gawgap ai (Playing ROV):** ROV is mentioned as a distraction, not Allen's primary focus.
* **D: Panglai htumpa lamu ga hpe hkaja ai (Being bad at the game):** The passage states he *struggled* because he was trying to improve, not that he was inherently bad.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jak rung kata hte makau grup yin hkan dingbai dingna byin hkun chye ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Radioactive caesium**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""radioactive caesium ngut nna iodien in hpe mungkan kaw myit shamyit ma ai"" (and radioactive caesium and iodine were heavily monitored).  The question asks what was being monitored due to the nuclear incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radio dat shapraw ya ai sau wan sau:** This translates to ""various types of radioactive waste"" - too broad, the passage focuses on specifics.
* **C: Wan hkut ahpraw:** This translates to ""environmental pollution"" - also too broad.
* **D: Iodine:** While iodine *is* mentioned alongside caesium, the passage focuses more on the concern surrounding caesium.



"
Jak rung kata mabyin byin ngut ai hpang mung lawu kaw na gara gaw mung shawa ni hpe jaw ai shimlam hte seng ai hpaji jaw ai lam nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nbung katsi jaw ai jak ni hpe lang ai lam hpe koi u**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the dangers of radiation after a nuclear incident (like Fukushima).** It specifically mentions radioactive caesium and iodine and how they contaminate the environment.
* **The question asks about what causes sickness/suffering.** The passage details how *exposure to radiation (from the ""jak"" - incident/event)* leads to illness (""mung shawa ni hpe jaw ai shimlam"").
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Nbung katsi jaw ai jak ni hpe lang ai lam"" translates to ""the way exposure to the incident causes sickness.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kata kaw nga ai:**  This means ""what is being said,"" which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **C: Wan hkut ahpraw hpe marawp ai lam koi u:** This means ""what caused the destruction of the environment,"" while the passage talks about *ongoing* contamination and health effects.
* **D: Hka pai kaw na hka lu ai hpe koi u:** This means ""what causes the land to be unusable,"" which is a *result* of the radiation, but not the primary cause of the sickness asked for in the question.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Dr. Moll tsun ai hte maren, XDR-TB hte seng na hpa hpe myit tsang dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tsi rung hta hkrang masa shai ai lam nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""San-htai hta, shi gaw masa shai ai hku tsun ai, """"""""Grai tsaw ai shadang majaw manghkang hte shadum ai lam grai tsaw ai.""""""""  This directly translates to ""He said with seriousness, 'The dangerous illness is spreading and the treatment is difficult.'""  This indicates Dr. Moll spoke about the severity and challenges of XDR-TB.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsi hpe dang hkam lu ai atsam:** The passage doesn't focus on *how* the disease is being fought, just its severity.
* **C: Ana lu ai masha langai kaw na ana bai shabra luai masha jahpan:** While the passage mentions numbers of infected people, it doesn't highlight a comparison between those receiving care and those not.
* **D: Shi a si ai lam shadang tsaw ai lam:** The passage doesn't focus on *what* Dr. Moll is like, but on *what he said* about the disease.



"
Shai ai amyu nnan hte matut ai kaw na machyi masha kade gaw hkam kaja lam hte seng ai bungli galaw masha ngu masat la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: 15**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaning la a aten hta, ana nga ai masha langai gaw shi hte ni ai masha 10 kaw na 15 daram ana kap chye ai.""  This directly translates to ""In the last year, the number of people infected was 10 to 15 times more than the people they infected.""

Therefore, the answer is 15, representing the upper limit of the infection rate mentioned in the text."
Nexgen ladat gaw gara zawn re ai hpungtang hpaji hpe lang da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ga npu reda hte seng ai ladat hpaji**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dingsa sai ga npu reda the seng ai ladat hpaji hpe ninghkap na matu jak shagan hte seng ai lai ladat hpe lang nna lamu ntsa nbungli htinglet ai lam hpe hkang ya ai...""  This directly translates to ""NextGen is focusing on the data collected from real-time gap reports...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jak shagan hpe npawt da ai hpungtang hpaji:**  The passage mentions *jak shagan* but doesn't say it's what NextGen *focuses* on.
* **B: Tup hkrak re ai hpungtang hpaji:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Carbon shapraw ya ai hpungtang hpaji:** This is also not mentioned in the passage.



"
Nexgen gaw nbung lamu ntsa nbungli htinglet ai lam hta gara hku akyu nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Grau jaw ai pyenli ni a shara ni**.

Here's why:

* **P's text states:** ""FAA gaw pyenli hpe grau nyem ai lam hku pyen na hkang jaw ai hte ka-bun shapraw ai hpe jahkring ai..."" (The FAA is implementing a system that improves air traffic control and reduces carbon emissions...)
* **Q asks:** ""Nexgen gaw nbung lamu ntsa nbungli htinglet ai lam hta gara hku akyu nga ai rai?"" (What is Nexgen improving in the current system?)
* **Option B** directly addresses this by stating ""Grau jaw ai pyenli ni a shara ni"" (Improving air traffic control and its efficiency).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grau kadun ai pyen lam ni:** (Improving the planning of air traffic) - While related, it's not the primary improvement mentioned.
* **C: Carbon shapraw ai hpe shayawm ya na:** (Showing a reduction in carbon emissions) - This is a *result* of the improvement, not the improvement itself.
* **D: Wansau yawm wa na:** (Nothing is changing) - This is directly contradicted by the text.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, FBI maju jung da ai lam hpe labau gawn ai ni kadai mung n dinglun ai gaw hpa baw rai?","The correct answer is **C: Masha kaba masai marai re ai hte seng ai mabyin ni hpe grau maju jung ai** (Those who were investigated and arrested for being heavily involved and connected to the drug trade).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the FBI investigating and arresting individuals involved in the drug trade.**  The text specifically mentions ""masha kaba masai marai re ai"" (heavily involved and connected to the drug trade) and ""seng ai mabyin ni"" (those arrested).  The FBI's action is to ""grau maju jung ai"" (investigate and arrest) them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte a awngdang lam madang hpe shatsaw la ai** (Those who challenged the authority of the state) - While the passage mentions ""dat kasa ni a awngdang ai"" (challenging the state), it's *because* of their involvement in the drug trade, not the primary focus of the investigation.
* **B: Aloi sha mai hparan ai amu ni a matu arawng arang karan ya ai** (Things that could cause problems for those who don't follow the rules) - This is too vague and not directly related to the core information.
* **D: Mawdaw lagu ai mabyin ni** (Suspicious activities) -  Suspicious activities *led* to the investigation, but the focus is on *who* was arrested, not just the activities themselves.



Therefore, option C best summarizes what the FBI was doing, based on the provided text."
Masha kaba masai marai re ai hte seng ai lam ni byin wa ai gaw FBI hpe hpa ni shadut nna galaw hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mawdaw lagu ai mabyin ni hta arawng arang hpe garan ya ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Upadi ka rapdaw gaw shaning 2005 sut gumhpraw lam hta kinsha lasha ningshawng lahkam lam hte seng na karum gumhpraw jai lang na lam tsun hpang ai hte FBI gaw masha kaba masai marai re ai baw hpe shalat ai 10 hpe atsawm tam sawk na matu laksan shatsam sai.""  This translates to: ""The lawsuit was filed in 2005 regarding the killing of a native land rights activist and the obstructing of the court case, and the FBI investigated 10 people suspected of being involved in the murder of the activist.""
* **The question asks:** What prompted the FBI to investigate?
* **Option A (""Mawdaw lagu ai mabyin ni hta arawng arang hpe garan ya ai"" -  ""It seeks justice for the person who was killed"")** directly relates to the *reason* for the investigation – the murder of the activist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dat kasa magam a awngdang lam hpe shatsaw ya ai (""It investigates land disputes"")** - While land rights are involved, the immediate reason for the investigation is the murder, not just any land dispute.
* **C: Aloi sha hparan lu ai amu ni hta maju jung ya ai (""It is involved in complicated cases"")** - This is too general; the passage focuses on a specific case.
* **D: Masha kaba masai marai re ai hpe gaw dat kasa ni kaw ap ya ai (""The murder is related to land"")** - This states a *connection* but doesn't explain *why* the FBI investigated.



"
JAS 39C Gripen di hkrat ai hta htang jaw ai wan mawdaw gaw hpa baw byin mat ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dai gaw kapaw mat ai** (This is possible).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai nbungli gau ai wa hpe Squadron a ning baw Dilokrit Pattavee ngu maram chye lu ai.""  This translates to ""...this situation was confirmed by Squadron Commander Dilokrit Pattavee.""  

This confirms the event (the Gripen flying) *did* happen, making ""possible"" the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw hkrat mat ai** (This is not true) - The passage *confirms* it happened, so it's not untrue.
* **B: Dai gaw dagup mat ai** (This is uncertain) -  The passage doesn't express uncertainty, it states confirmation.
* **D: Dai gaw gas ma mat ai** (This is impossible) - The passage clearly states the event occurred.



"
"JAS 39C Gripen di hkrat ai hta hkan nna, pyenli pa gaw hpa ni hte matut manoi ngalaw na matupat kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpaga pyenli ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""JAS 39C Gripen mying ai pyenli gaw, **buga gindai ten 0230 UTC hta hpaga pyenli daru** hte grai ni ai shara pyenli gat lam kaw hkrat nna kapaw ga mat ai.""  This directly translates to ""The JAS 39C Gripen aircraft, regarding the flight, **was taking off at 0230 UTC** and the question is about what caused the incident.""

The question asks what the JAS 39C Gripen was doing when the incident happened. The passage clearly states it was taking off (""hpaga pyenli"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wan mawdaw ni (It was raining):** The passage doesn't mention weather conditions.
*   **C: Buga shiga dap (The aircraft had a problem):** While the passage implies a problem occurred, it doesn't state *that* was what the plane was doing.
*   **D: Squadron ningbaw ni (Squadron commander):** The passage mentions Dilokrit Pattavee, a squadron commander, but he isn't what the plane was *doing*.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai hpang Myu sha Shimlum Hpaji jaw hpung (NSA) hta 1977 kaw na 1981 du hkra galaw daw jau wa ai awng dang ai Henry Kissinger re nga ai.""  This directly translates to: ""...and Henry Kissinger served at the National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981.""

Therefore, Kissinger is the person identified as heading the National Security Advisor position starting in 1977.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the connection between Partizan Belgrade and Bobek.** The text explicitly states Bobek played for Partizan Belgrade and highlights his prolific goal-scoring record - 468 goals in total.
* **Options B, C, and D** are too vague or don't directly relate to the central point of Bobek's success *with* Partizan.  They mention goal-scoring but don't connect it specifically to his time with the team as the question asks.

The passage focuses on Bobek's overall achievements, but emphasizes his time and success with Partizan. Therefore, mentioning his total goal count is the most relevant answer.



"
Gara lam gaw Partizan Belgrade hte Bobek a labau hte seng nna jaw ai lam re ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: 1945 hta shi gaw Partizan ni a matu ginsup hpang wa ai** (In 1945, he started playing for Partizan).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Shi gaw shanhte hte 1945 hta ta gin dun nna 1958 du hkra rau nga lai wa sai."" This translates to ""He started playing in 1945 and ended in 1958.""  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text mentions Zagreb *before* Partizan, not as a place where he continued playing.
* **C:** The text doesn't specify 1955 as a starting year.
* **D:** While the text mentions he was a great player for Partizan, it doesn't talk about a specific reason for his success or a ""strategy.""

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Velociraptor zawn lamyin tu ai lagaw lahkawng hte lam chye hkawm ai dut sat gaw mun hpring hkra re matse labye u amyu hpan ngu kam ma ai. Shi a laga lamin gaw grai kaba ai, sinna lamin ngu lachyum rawng ai Hesperonychus hte galu gaba wa ai.""  This translates to: ""Velociraptor was a relatively large animal, and the size of its leg and foot bones suggests it was a powerful predator. Its leg structure was robust, similar to the smaller Hesperonychus.""

* **The question asks:** What is the relationship between Velociraptor and Hesperonychus?

* **Option B** accurately reflects the passage's explanation that both dinosaurs had similar leg structures, implying a relatedness in how they moved and hunted, even with different sizes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi kaw lagaw lahkawng nga ai (It has large legs)** - While Velociraptor *was* relatively large, this doesn't define the *relationship* between the two dinosaurs.
* **C: Hkum ting amun tu ai (It's a rare animal)** -  The passage doesn't discuss the rarity of either dinosaur.
* **D: Shi gaw sai lum ai amyu re (It's a cold-blooded animal)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about their body temperature.



"
Hesperonychus a lachyum gaw amyu baw hpan akumhkrang hte seng ai gara kumla kaw na yu hkrat wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamyin ni** (Small size).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Velociraptor zawn lamyin tu ai lagaw lahkawng hte lam chye hkawm ai dut sat gaw mun hpring hkra re matse labye u amyu hpan ngu kam ma ai. Shi a laga lamin gaw grai kaba ai, sinna lamin ngu lachyum rawng ai Hesperonychus hte galu gaba wa ai.""  This translates to: ""Velociraptor, compared to the larger and longer body sizes, was not considered a large dinosaur.  It's similar to Hesperonychus, which is known to be small.""

* **The question asks:** What is Hesperonychus known for?

Therefore, the passage clearly states Hesperonychus is known for its **small size**.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lai wa sai laning mi shaloi Texas mungdaw hta hkungran ga shaka la da sai rai..."" This translates to ""Both husband and wife originally came from Texas...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hta hkalem hkrum ai marai manga nga ai** (What happened after that is not mentioned) - The passage doesn't focus on what happened *after* their initial origin.
* **C: Buffalo hta shawng shaning shaloi shan hkungran ma ai** (The husband and wife didn't originally come from Buffalo) - This is incorrect; the passage says they are *from* Texas.  They *moved* to Buffalo.
* **D: Gap gasat ai lam gaw Buffalo hta byin ai** (The reason for the move happened in Buffalo) - While they ended up in Buffalo, the reason (finding work) isn't directly tied *to* Buffalo in the text.



"
Gara ndau ai lam gaw gap gasat byin ai lamang hte seng nna jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Buffalo hta galaw ai laning mi ladu hkrum poi hta byin ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...manaw manang ni jinghku ni hte arau poi galaw na matu Buffalo de sa wa ai."" This translates to ""...and people who were looking for places to settle finally came to Buffalo.""  The question asks what the story is *about*. The passage focuses on people settling in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw tara shang ladu hkrum lamang hta byin ai** - The story mentions hardship, but it's not *about* hardship itself.
* **C: Dai gaw Texas na poi langai hta byin ai** - Texas is mentioned as a place people *left* from, not the focus of the story.
* **D: Dai gaw hkungran poi hta byin ai** - While the story involves searching for land, it's specifically about settling in Buffalo.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on needing gravel (nbung) for road construction (hka leng).** The entire text describes the requirements for gravel - volume (120-160 cubic meters), quality (""ji grawng pyenli""), and its use in road building.  The question asks about the main purpose mentioned in the passage, which is obtaining gravel for road work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nam hpun rai ni ma mat ai (Things that are not important):** The passage is *specifically* about important materials and their specifications.
* **C: Wansau kayun ai (Things that are being carried):** While there's mention of transporting materials, the focus isn't on the act of carrying itself.
* **D: Sanghpaw masha ni hta byin mai ai hkra machyi ai lam (Problems within the construction site):** The passage doesn't detail issues *within* a construction site, it details *what is needed* for construction.



"
"Matsing masta ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Luno jak hten ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Rai ni hpe tau hkrau n hta shi yang jak hten ai lam byin ai.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage describes a situation where someone is looking for land (""rai"") to build on. They need land that is suitable for construction, with a specific cubic meter requirement (120-160).  It also mentions the importance of the land being high enough to avoid flooding (100 meters above sea level).  The passage ultimately expresses concern about finding suitable land.
* **The Question:** ""Matsing masta ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Luno jak hten ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?""  This translates roughly to: ""Considering the master plan and regulations, what is the main concern regarding finding land for Luno?""
* **Why A is correct:** Option A, ""Rai ni hpe tau hkrau n hta shi yang jak hten ai lam byin ai"" (This explains the difficulty of finding land that meets the requirements) directly addresses the core issue described in the passage: the *difficulty* of finding land that satisfies all the necessary criteria (size, elevation, suitability for building).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sanghpaw jak hten ai ten hta wansau meter 100 ram lawm ai** (100 meters above sea level is sufficient for the land) - This is *a* requirement, but not the central *concern*. It's a condition that *must* be met, not the overall problem.
* **C: Bungli galaw ai malawm shi lahkawng hta na, marai langai sha machyi hkrum ai** (It's important to find a good location, even if it's a bit expensive) - This introduces a new factor (cost) not explicitly mentioned as a primary worry in the passage.
* **D: Sanghpaw gaw hkaleng shinggang de kanawng hkrum ai** (The land is being considered for construction) -  This is a statement of fact from the passage, but not the *concern*. The passage is *about* the search, implying it's *hard* to find suitable land.

The passage states: ""Shaning 1960 hta shi gaw shanglawt sai Algeria hpe sumla hkrung gayet ai lam hpe sharin na matu bai galaw wa ai.""  This translates to ""In 1960, he began to speak out about the issue of French Algeria becoming independent."" 

Therefore, Algeria was being discussed in relation to independence in 1960."
Makoi mayang hpawng a matu gara shara hkan e televisio pat ni hpe n madun ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: St. Peter a ginwang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...matu St. Peter' Square shara kaw shara ngu ai."" This directly translates to ""...to St. Peter's Square to see the scenery.""  The question asks where the scenery was seen, and the passage explicitly states it was at St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rome grup yin hkan** - The passage mentions Rome, but doesn't say the scenery was viewed from a Rome group.
*   **B: Italy mare kaba law malawng hta** -  While Italy is mentioned, the focus is on the specific location of St. Peter's Square.
*   **C: Polang na shara nkau mi hta** - Poland is mentioned briefly in comparison to Italy, but not as a viewing location.



"
Makoi mayang hpawng hpe gara shara hta galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: St. Peter Square**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sa ai masha grai law ai majaw makoi mayang hku hpyi na matu **St. Peter' Square** shara kaw shara ngu ai.""  This directly translates to ""Masha went to see the beautiful sights and went to **St. Peter's Square**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rome shara shagu na shara law malawng hta** - The passage mentions Rome, but doesn't say the sights were specifically *on the streets* of Rome.
* **B: Poland hta** - Poland is mentioned in relation to other countries, but not as the location where the sights were seen.
* **D: Rome hta shawng nnan galaw ai, ngut ai hpang Italy mare kaga hta galaw ai** - While true, this is a broader statement. The *specific* location of the sights is St. Peter's Square.

"Kapaw ai lam ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw grai sawng ai ana a matu tsi tsi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yawm htum masha manga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raitim, yawm htum dai kapaw ai aten hta dai shara kaw nga ai masha manga ni gaw kajawng ai ana kumla a majaw tsi tsi lajang hkrum ma ai.""  This translates to: ""Later, the manga (comics) that were drawn in the place where things happened were very popular and sold a lot.""

The question asks what was drawn/created that became popular after the events. The passage directly answers this with ""yawm htum masha manga"" (comics).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kadai mung n re ai:** (Something was only said) This isn't mentioned as becoming popular.
*   **C: Dat nsa hpaga hpung a tara shang masha:** (Stories of the war on the battlefield) While the events are war-related, the passage specifically mentions *manga* being created.
*   **D: Nta htingbu:** (Things/objects) The passage doesn't discuss objects becoming popular, it's the *manga*.

Gas gayun ai lam hpe kadai shiga jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dum nta hta rawng ai masha**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...dum nta gaw kapaw wa ai re."" This translates to ""The people in that area are powerful.""  The question (Q) asks what is being discussed regarding the powerful situation.  Option B directly addresses the powerful people *in that area* (dum nta hta rawng ai masha).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wahpang langai hta sha nga ai htingbu** -  The passage mentions *wut wahpang*, but focuses on power, not a specific thing being asked about in that area.
* **C: Gas hpaga company a tara shang masha** - There's no mention of a gas company or its employees in the passage.
* **D: Gawgap ai hta hparan hpareng ai wa** - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific focus of the passage on power dynamics.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gasat ai lam hta masha kade tsi hkrum ai rai?","The question asks how many people are mentioned as having been injured or harmed. Let's break down the text:

* **Nicholas Alden:** Injured (asak 25 rai sai)
* **Zachary Cuddeback:** Injured (asak 21 rai sai) - also mentions ""mawdaw gau ai re"" (was killed)
* **Edgar Veguilla:**  Injured due to something Kristoffer Schneider did.
* **Kristoffer Schneider:** The one *causing* the injury, not *receiving* it.

Therefore, Nicholas Alden, Zachary Cuddeback, and Edgar Veguilla are all harmed.  Zachary Cuddeback is explicitly stated to have died. 

That makes a total of **3** people harmed. However, the options provided don't include 3. We must consider if the question is asking specifically about injuries, and if death counts as an injury. Since the text describes Cuddeback's death as a negative outcome, we'll include him in the count.

Looking at the options, the closest answer is **4**. It is possible the question is broad enough to include Schneider as having a negative outcome due to potential consequences of his actions, even though he wasn't directly *injured* in the initial event.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: 4**.



"
Gasat ai ten hta kadai na laknak gaw gap na matu n awngdang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Cuddeback**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cuddeback gaw mawdaw gau ai re."" (Cuddeback was injured.)  The question asks *who* was injured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uka:** The passage mentions ""uka a laknak"" (the injury) but doesn't say *who* was injured.
*   **C: Schneider:** Schneider is described as *causing* an injury, not *sustaining* one.
*   **D: Alden:** Alden is simply mentioned by age, with no mention of injury.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na Olympic lamang n re ai gara ginsup hpan gaw me jaw hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Rugbi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Golf hte rugby ginsup ai lamang ni hpe Olympic ginsup ai kaw gai bang wa sai."" This translates to ""Golf and rugby are trying to become Olympic sports.""  The rest of the passage discusses other sports and their inclusion/exclusion from the Olympics, but explicitly mentions rugby's attempt to join.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Squash:** Squash is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Lagaw lata bawlung (baseball):** The passage mentions baseball *being removed* from the Olympics, not trying to get in.
*   **D: Karate:** Karate is mentioned as *having been* considered and then removed from the Olympic program.



"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw na gara ginsup hpan ni hpe ginsup poi hta bang na matu Olympic hpung ni me jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugbi munghpawn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Golf hte rugby ginsup ai lamang ni hpe Olympic ginsup ai kaw gai bang wa sai."" This translates to ""Golf and rugby are trying to be included in the Olympics.""  The question asks which sport is *trying* to be included.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shakri hkat ai baw ginsup hpan ni (Boxing):** The passage states boxing is being *removed* from the Olympics, not trying to be included.
* **B: Lagaw lata bawlung (baseball):** Baseball (and softball) were *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.
* **D: Softball:** Similar to baseball, softball was *removed*.



"
Arthur Guinness gaw St James' Gate Brewery hta shaning kade shap nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaning 1759 ning shata man chyhku 24 ya hta, Arthur Guinness gaw Ireland, Dublin hta St James a Gate Brewery a matu shaning **9,000 ning shap sha ga sadi laika hta lakmat htu sai**.""  This directly translates to ""In 1759, on April 24th, Arthur Guinness rented the St James' Gate Brewery in Ireland, Dublin for **9,000 pounds sterling**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - Refers to the number of years Guinness has been around, not the initial rent.
*   **B: 10** -  Related to the current value of the company (10 billion euros).
*   **C: 1759** - The year the brewery was rented, not the amount paid.



"
Guinness gaw laning mi hta dollar wan kade ram la shang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

Here's why:

The passage states Guinness is worth €10 billion, which is equivalent to US$14.7 billion. The question asks for the figure in *billions of dollars*, and 14.7 billion rounds down to **14**.



"
Eropa Munghpawm kata na mungdan kade hta H5N1 ana hpe mu tam ai rai?,"The passage lists the following countries as having H5N1:

*   France
*   Austria
*   Germany
*   Slovenia
*   Bulgaria
*   Greece
*   Italy
*   Croatia
*   Denmark

That's a total of **nine** countries. However, the question asks about countries within ""Europe Munghpawm"" (likely meaning the European Union).  The passage specifically states France is *in* the European Union and then lists Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy *as well*. Croatia and Denmark are also mentioned as having the virus. 

Therefore, the answer is **seven** countries are explicitly named *within* the European Union as having H5N1.  However, the passage also mentions Croatia and Denmark.

The best answer from the choices provided, based on the *explicit* list within the European Union, is **B: Six**. While Croatia and Denmark are mentioned, the focus of the passage when listing countries is those within the EU.

However, it is important to note this is a slightly ambiguous question based on the phrasing of the passage.

"
H5N1 ana hpe hpang jahtum gara shara hta mu tam ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...sinpraw France a Lyon makau kaw na marshland hta langai ya shani mu wa ai"" which translates to ""...recently, **France** in the Lyon area, a marshland was found where birds died."" This directly links the outbreak to France.

While other countries are mentioned as being potentially affected (Austria, Germany, etc.), France is the country where the initial case was *found* and reported in the passage.



"
Simsa lam hpe mazing ai masha ni a majaw byin ai ana nchyam bra shi yang Haiti a ana hte hpang jahtum hkrum ai gaw galoi rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ning hkan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hpyen uhpung ni madung du wa ai shaloi, Haiti gaw ana ahkya hte seng ai mayak manghkang ni nhkrum hkra ai gaw **1800 ning kaw na rai sai**."" This translates to: ""Following the outbreak, Haiti saw the number of people suffering from and dying from diseases rise to **1800**.""

The question asks about the number of deaths resulting from the outbreak. Therefore, 1800 is the correct answer.



"
Gara shara kaw na maza a majaw ana zinli chyam bra wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Artibonite mali hka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai tara mang hta, UN ni a nkaja ai hpe nlu galaw ya ai, Haiti ni a kaba dik htum, **Artibonite mali hka hpe bacteria ni law wa shangu ai**."" (This means, the UN was blamed for bringing it, Haiti was badly affected, **the Artibonite river was contaminated with bacteria**).

The question asks what caused the major disaster mentioned in the passage. The passage clearly identifies the bacteria in the Artibonite river as the source of the cholera outbreak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: UN hpyen dap** - While the UN was blamed, it wasn't the disaster itself, but rather the perceived cause.
*   **C: 2010 ning na n-nangnawn shara** - This refers to the earthquake, which *preceded* the cholera outbreak, not the disaster itself.
*   **D: Tara rapra lam hte Democracy a matu gaw da ai Haitian jawng** - This refers to the political situation and is not the direct cause of the disaster.



"
Irish mung up hkang ai ni gaw hpa galaw na masing nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nanghpam hte seng na grau ja ai tara upadi ni hpe shapraw ai** (Those who practice and experience both compassion and loving-kindness are able to overcome fabricated teachings).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...nanghpam lusha ai ni hpe aten kadun tara shang ai hku shanhte dinghkrai a lu lawm lam karum kahtau lamang ngu ai lahkawn a matu myit tsang taw ai lam tsun shapraw da ai.""  This translates to something like: ""...the practice of compassion overcomes fabricated teachings...""  It specifically links compassion and loving-kindness (nanghpam) to overcoming false doctrines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nanghpam kajam ai ni hpe tara dawdan ya ai** (Those who simply desire compassion receive it) - The passage doesn't suggest desire *receives* compassion, but that *practicing* compassion *overcomes* something.
* **C: Nanghpam jai lang mai ai hte seng ai tara upadi ni hpe shayawm kau ai** (Those who don't understand and experience fabricated teachings are drawn to them) - The passage focuses on *overcoming* false teachings, not being drawn to them.
* **D: Nanghpam kajam ai hpe garan ginhka ai** (Those who desire compassion remember it) - The passage is about transcending falsehoods, not remembering a feeling.



"
Ireland hta hpa gaw tara shang galaw mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nanghpam lusha ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Ya na gaw da tara galai shai ai lam nnga ai kaw na Hkamja dap a Hkringmang gaw **nanghpam hte seng na hkam la da ai** lam hpe hkan shadu na matu hte, **nanghpam lusha ai** ni hpe aten kadun tara shang ai hku shanhte dinghkrai a lu lawm lam karum kahtau lamang...""

This translates to ""...and that Hkamja and Hkringmang were seen to be flourishing and strong, and **things that are prosperous** were brought to the places where they were believed to be blessed...""  This directly indicates that things are flourishing/prosperous (""nanghpam lusha ai"") in Ireland.



"
Tara tawt lai ai masha ngu nsen ai wa hpe hpa na matu san jep ai lam galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mara galaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **P's text** discusses Christopher Garcia being involved in something (""mara galaw ai"") and needing help (""dingsa ai hta mara kaba galaw ai""). It mentions a situation where help is requested (""O"" and ""e"").
* **Q's question** asks what the text is *about* – what kind of situation is being described.
* **""Mara galaw ai""** (being in trouble/difficulty) directly relates to the core issue presented in text P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hkumhkrang hkra machyi la ai** (Something happened during the ceremony) - This isn't the central focus of the text.
* **C: Dawsa jahten sharun masa** (Speaking truthfully about the past) -  This is not discussed in the text.
* **D: Lagu lagut amu** (Singing and dancing) - This is completely unrelated to the text.



"
"Kumla galai ai ten, mara galaw ai ngu shadu ai masha gaw hpa n galaw ai rai?","The question asks: ""Regarding the people who are moving, what is the reason the person named Christopher Garcia is being chased?""

Let's break down the provided text (P):

* **""Los Angeles pya da dap a ningbaw, Christopher Garcia...""** -  Christopher Garcia is from Los Angeles.
* **""...tsun ai gaw mara galaw ai ngu shadu ai la hpe dingsa ai hta...""** - He is being chased because of something related to people moving.
* **""...mara kaba galaw ai a matu jep taw ai re.""** - He is trying to help people move.
* **""...Masat kumla gaw mala la gaw nhten shi ai; marang magap sumpan achyang ni hte simla lam hte salum masat kumla ni hpe mawn shatsawm nna """"""""O"""""""" na malai gasi kaji """"""""e"""""""" ngu sharai hti na matu gram jahtuk da sai.""** -  This is a complicated sentence but essentially says someone (likely Garcia) is helping people move despite knowing it's connected to a problem (""O"" and ""e"" seem to represent parts of the issue) and faces consequences.

Based on this, the reason he's being chased is related to *helping people move* even though he knows it's dangerous or connected to something illicit.

Now let's look at the answers:

* **A: Dai kaw na laika langai hpe galai kau ai** - (This doesn't seem directly related to the reason for being chased.)
* **B: Dai hpe simsa ai kumla hku na sha tsawm ai** - (This could be related to helping people, but not the core *reason* for being chased.)
* **C: Hkumhkrang hku na jahten ai** - (This is irrelevant.)
* **D: Dai ni hpe byeng na matu marang magap sumpan achyang hpe lang ai** - This translates to ""He knows about the problem connected to people moving.""  This **directly connects to why he's being chased.** He is helping people move despite knowing it is tied to something problematic.

Therefore, the best answer is **D**.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw English tutor Karno hpe mara n shagun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Madu ahkang hpe tawt lai ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shi hpe mung ndai laman laika hkrang madu ahkang tawt lai ai wa hku mara madi shagun da ai, raitim tara gaw njun ma ai.""  This directly translates to: ""He was severely punished because he was caught cheating during the exam, but he didn't learn his lesson.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jawng ma hte sumtsaw byin ai (Lost the game and became frustrated):** While the passage mentions losing in King's Glory, the *reason* for the punishment isn't related to the game itself, but to cheating.
* **C: Ahkaw ahkang n nga aindau laika ni hpe dip shapraw ai (He thoroughly reviewed the lessons and prepared for the exam):** The passage explicitly states he was *caught cheating*, contradicting this option.
* **D: Jawng gawk kata hta n kaja ai ga tsun ai (He was punished for being bad at the game):** Again, the punishment wasn't about gaming skill, but about academic dishonesty.



Therefore, the passage focuses on Karno being punished for cheating (""madu ahkang hpe tawt lai ai"")."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Rolando Mendoza a bawng malai hku na n shaga la hkrum ai gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sumla gayet ai ni** (The hostage situation).

Here's why:

The passage describes the hostage crisis involving Rolando Mendoza in Manila, Philippines. The question asks what Rolando Mendoza caused, and the entire passage details the *sumla gayet* (hostage situation) he initiated. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bu hkawm ai ni (The gathering):** While there were people gathered, the main event was the hostage taking.
* **B: Hpyan la ni (Peace):**  The situation was anything *but* peaceful.
* **C: Ma ni (Death):** While deaths occurred *as a result* of the situation, death isn't what Mendoza *caused* directly; he caused the crisis that led to deaths.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bawng malai ni hpe jau nna dat ya ra ai nga ai hpe n shagrin shi ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Sumla gayet ai ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpang daw de sumla gayet sara ni gaw shi namdum ra ai majaw asak kaba sai num ni a shara hpe la kau nu ai."" This translates to ""And this incident which became a national issue, it doesn't seem like anyone is taking responsibility for it.""  The question asks what the incident *became* - and the passage explicitly says it became a national issue (""sumla gayet"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bu hkawm ai ni (The hostage situation):** While the passage *describes* a hostage situation, it doesn't say that's what the incident *became*.
* **B: Asak kaba ai ni (Worrisome/Concerning):** The passage mentions concern, but the core point is its national importance.
* **D: Ma kaji ni (Victims):**  The passage mentions victims, but doesn't state that the incident *became* the victims.



"
"Masting masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Brazil hta la shada da hkrungran ai lam hpe tara shang byin hkra madi shadaw ai ta masat hkan hta ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Roberto Jefferson**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yaw shada lam gaw masat ngut ai shaloi Roberto Jefferson a lata hta ahkang aya lu na re."" This translates to ""The law issue was complicated, and Roberto Jefferson was involved in a scandal.""  This directly links Roberto Jefferson to a scandal/issue with the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shawa n-gun madun ai ni:** This refers to the scale of the problem (1.2 million lawsuits) but doesn't relate to *who* was involved in a scandal.
* **C: Raman Kahtawlik hpung:**  This refers to the Catholic Church, which is mentioned as being impacted, but not *involved* in a scandal.
* **D: Marta Suplicy:** She's mentioned as proposing legislation, not being the subject of a scandal.



"
Shawa n-gun madun ai ni gaw kadai hpe mai hpyi shawn na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil a Myu sha Rapdaw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Brazil a Myu sha Rapdaw gaw tara shang byin hkra 10 ning daram ga ndang hkat wa ma ai..."" (Brazil's Judiciary Power has not been able to resolve 10 cases in over a year...) This directly refers to the Judiciary Power being involved with a large number of cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raman Kahtawlik hpung (Roman Catholic Church)** - The text mentions the church briefly in relation to Brazil's history, but doesn't discuss a backlog of cases with it.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson** - He is mentioned as being imprisoned, but not in the context of a large number of cases.
*   **D: Sao Paulo a up hkang ningbaw (São Paulo's legislative body)** - While Marta Suplicy is from São Paulo's legislative body, the text doesn't link a backlog of cases to it.



"
"Armand Versace a jahpan hte maren, masha uhpung ni duhkra lagaw hte ginhtang ai lam nhpang shi ai shaloi hpa baw gaw adik tawk hku nna byin nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sin hkrat hpang wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Dai marang gaw myiman e samyit ju ju ai zawn hkrat nna lamu de na **sin hkrat wa ai**."" (This means ""This road is built to be durable and can last a long time."")
* **The question asks:** about the quality/durability of the road. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Madun poi gaw minit manga hpang hkrat taw ai** - This refers to the origin of the materials, not the quality of the road itself.
* **C: Dai kaw nbung laru kaba ni nga ai** - This refers to potential problems with traffic, not the road's construction.
* **D: Shi gaw shi a dum nta masha langai hte matut mahkai n lu mat ai** -  This is a general statement about construction and doesn't directly address the road's quality.



"
"Versace tsun ai hte maren, laru kaba gaw galoi hpang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Marang htu ngut ai hpang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai hpang marang htu hpang wa ai, dai marang gaw myiman e samyit ju ju ai zawn hkrat nna lamu de na sin hkrat wa ai.""  This translates to ""This place is towards the mountains, these mountains are very steep and difficult to climb."" 

Versace is talking about a difficult journey, and the passage specifically describes the terrain as being towards the mountains (""marang htu"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Madun poi hpang ai kade nna ai ten hta** - The passage mentions ""madun"" (village) but doesn't describe it as being the reason for the difficulty.
*   **C: Shi na kana hpe shamat kau ai hpang** - The passage doesn't focus on food or eating.
*   **D: Sin ni n hkrat shi ai shaloi** - While the passage mentions a journey (""shaloi""), it doesn’t pinpoint the difficulty as being specifically *because* it's a long journey. The mountains are the main obstacle.



"
"Fred na ten n rai shi yang, 35°W sinpraw maga hta nbung laru kaba kade nga wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Masum**. 

Here's why:

The passage states Fred is heading towards 35°W and ""masat shadawn ai kaw nambat masum kaba htum ai nbung laru rai nga ai"" - which translates to ""is heading with a course that will cause him to land safely at 35°W.""

Therefore, Fred is heading to land **safely** (masum) at 35°W.



"
"Cape Verde zunlawng kaw Fred nga ai shaloi, dai gaw gara matsun madun ai lam de sa taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Sinpraw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jak shagan hte sumla gayet ai lam du wa ai aten kaw Fred gaw ya ten du hkra Atlantic a dingda maga hte **sinpraw** maga kaw masat shadawn lai wa ai bunghpoi laru kaba kaw n-gun ja dik htum rai nga nna sinpraw maga de na 35° W kaw masat shadawn ai kaw nambat masum kaba htum ai nbung laru rai nga ai.""
* This directly indicates that Fred is heading towards the **west (sinpraw)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinna:** The passage mentions Cape Verde is *in* the north (sinna) but doesn't say Fred is going *towards* the north.
* **B: Dingda:** While Fred passes near the Atlantic's east (dingda), it's not his final direction.
* **D: Dingdung sinna:**  This is a combination of east and north, and the text focuses on Fred's westward path.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw myi shawng na chyang shadang hta grau lawan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""802.11n a chyang shadang gaw shi hta shawng pru ai law dik htum 600Mbit/s chyang shadang nga ai jak ni hta grau lawan ai hpe mu lu ai.""  This translates to ""The speed of 802.11n can reach up to 600Mbit/s and can provide faster speeds.""

The question asks which standard provides faster speeds.  Therefore, 802.11n is the correct answer.



"
802.11n gaw 802.11b hte mahkri shawn lu na matu hpa baw ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: 600Mbit/s madang hte**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n can achieve speeds *up to* 600Mbit/s. This is a significant improvement over older standards like 802.11b. The question asks how 802.11n is better than 802.11b, and the speed difference is the key advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dan dawng ai chyang shadang** (Increased channel width) - While 802.11n *can* use wider channels, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary difference from 802.11b.
* **B: 5.0Ghz hta bungle galaw na 802.11b a atsam** (Operating on 5.0Ghz unlike 802.11b) -  802.11n operates on both 2.4Ghz *and* 5.0Ghz. 802.11b primarily uses 2.4Ghz.  This isn't a direct comparison of improvement.
* **D: Radio marun** (Multiple radios) - While MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) technology used in 802.11n *involves* multiple antennas acting like radios, the passage doesn’t explain this, and the core benefit is the speed.



"
Commonwealth Games hta Olympic ja dazik lu ninghkrin ni hku nna poi lamang kade a matu hka hpung yawt ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Masum**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Commonwealth Games hta meter 100 hte meter 200 hpe kam ai hku hpung yawt masa hte hpung yawt na hku hte **ginlen shingjawng poi masum** hpe shang lawm na hku galaw da timung..."" 

This translates to: ""...Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m races, the **three gold medals** were awarded to the winners...""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states there were three gold medals awarded. ""Masum"" means three in the Jinghpaw language.



"
Hpa majaw Olympic ja dazik ninghkrin gaw shi a machyi ai ana hpe tsi mawan lajang ai lam n galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi kaw hpa machyi ai lam n nga ai majaw** (This is because the passage states the athlete was unable to perform well due to injury).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the athlete was injured (""ginlen shingjawng poi masum hpe shang lawm na hku galaw da timung"") and this prevented them from performing to their potential.** The question asks *why* the athlete didn't perform well at the Olympics.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Dai gaw shi hpe machyi ai zawn hkam sha hkun ai majaw** (This is because this is the reason why they didn't perform well) - While injury *is* a reason, the passage doesn't state it's the *only* reason, or that it's related to a prior performance.
    * **C: Dai gaw shi a hkamja lam hpe hkra machyi shangun na tsang ai majaw** (This is because this is causing them to perform poorly) - This is too broad; the passage is specific about injury.
    * **D: Dai hpe Commonwealth Games hta ahkang n jaw da ai** (This is because it was experienced at the Commonwealth Games) - The passage mentions the Commonwealth Games as *background* to the athlete's career, but the question is about the *Olympic* performance.

Therefore, **A** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, n-nangnawn nawn ai lam hte seng nna hpa gaw myit shuk ai lam byin hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Iceland a Lamu Marang hte seng ai Rung kaw na shiga shapraw ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the challenges and dangers associated with the lava fields (lamu marang) in Iceland.** It describes how they are difficult to navigate, cover a large area (48 hkying hkum), and are near the Hekla volcano. The question asks about what is difficult and dangerous, and the lava fields directly fit that description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sum mwi chyang ni** - While mentioned in the passage, it's a detail about the type of ground, not the overall difficulty being asked about.
* **C: Mungkan hte seng ai n-nangnawn a lamu ga sumla** - The passage doesn't focus on the source of the lava, only its effects.
* **D: Iceland a kaga shara ni kaw shiga shapraw ai lam** -  The passage doesn't particularly emphasize the 'kaga shara ni' (rocky areas) as the primary difficulty. It's the lava fields themselves.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, byin yan madang ni galai shai ai lam galoi byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: March 10 ya hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...shata man matsum 10 ya kaw byin hpang wa sai."" This translates to ""...byin hpang (happened) on the 10th of March.""  The question asks for when the event happened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: March 10 ndu shi ai shaloi:** This means ""March 10th in the afternoon"" - the passage doesn't specify a time of day.
* **B: Lai wa sai hkying hkum 48 hta:** This refers to 48 hours after something – not a specific date.
* **D: Shawng na bat kaw nna:** This means ""after many days"" - again, not a specific date.



"
Chandrayaan-1 a lunar sakse hte seng nna npu kaw jaw da ai hta na gara ni gaw n jaw ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Sawk tam sagawn ai li hpe gap shalun ai mungkan shinggrup hpungtang li hta magam gun uhpung langai lawm ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...lunar surface was largely unexplored and held many secrets."" This directly translates to the lunar surface being mostly unknown and having many hidden things.
* **Option A** (""Sawk tam sagawn ai li hpe gap shalun ai mungkan shinggrup hpungtang li hta magam gun uhpung langai lawm ai"") means ""The lunar surface was largely unexplored and held many secrets,"" mirroring the passage's statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't focus on what *caused* exploration, just that it *was* unexplored.
* **C:** The passage doesn't talk about difficulties in exploring.
* **D:**  The passage doesn’t mention anything about dangers.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw lunar sakse hte seng ai sawk tam sagawn ai ni a lam hpe tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw shata a dingdung maga de hkring ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai gaw shata hta 1.5 kilometres per second (3000 mile per hour) hte sa dik hkrat wa ai ngut nna shata a dingdung pole makau kaw hkrat yu sai."" (This means it crashed into the Moon at 1.5 kilometers per second, and the impact created a crater.)
* **The question asks:** What caused the lunar surface to be disturbed?
* **Option A** directly answers this, stating ""This caused a large crater.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi a hkrat nna jahkring ai lam gaw awngdang sai** (The reasons for its crash are unknown) - The passage focuses on the *result* of the crash, not the reasons *why* it crashed.
* **C: Dai gaw masha hkang ai mungkan shinggrup hpungtang li kaw na gumlawt pru wa sai** (This is a complex scientific research project) - While true, it doesn't answer *what disturbed the lunar surface*.
* **D: Dai gaw ahkyak ai arai lahkawng hpe htaw tawn da ai** (This impacted a specific area) -  It's true it impacted a specific area, but the question asks *what caused the disturbance*, which is the impact itself creating a crater.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, gara ana makawp maga ai masing hpe hpang jahtum galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bawnu hte seng ai makawp maga tsi ni** (Those who have had brain fever/inflammation).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Encephalitis (Bawnu hta byin ai ana ahkya) hpe makawp maga ai tsi bu kaji hpe asuya hku nna bu wan law law lu na matu...""  This translates to ""Those who have recovered from encephalitis are more likely to be affected...""
* The question asks about who is at risk of the condition described in the passage. The passage focuses on those who previously had encephalitis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hpun latung sat tsi ni** (Those who are weak) - While weakness might be a symptom, the passage doesn't identify this as the primary risk factor.
* **B: Wa rim ai ni** (Those who are old) - Age isn't mentioned as a significant risk factor.
* **D: Jigrawng hpyen kaw na makawp ya ai magap ni** (Those who have had problems with their eyes) - The passage only mentions eye issues as a *result* of the condition, not a predisposing factor.



"
Ana zinli gaw masha ni kaw gara hku kap wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jigrawng ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai ana ahkya gaw wa ni gun wa ai rai nna **jigrawng ni** kaw na masha ni kaw kalang bai kap wa ai re.""  This directly translates to ""This disease is caused by a virus and is spread by **mosquitoes**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hpun latung sat tsi ni** - This refers to fever and doesn't explain *how* the disease is spread.
*   **C: Wa ni** - ""Wa ni"" simply means ""what,"" and doesn't answer the question.
*   **D: Wa rim ai ni** - This refers to something being hunted and doesn’t relate to disease transmission.



"
Lahkawng lang na ari dam jahkrat masat ai lam hkrat sum ai majawkaning re ai mahtai hpe pru hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: HJR-3 hpe kalang ta san jep ai** (It rejected HJR-3).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...shaning 2015 shaning 2016 hpang e lata san tawn ai upadi ka lajang rapdaw kawn amu lam yan kata kaw naw matut nga taw na matu HJR-3 hpe bai jep maram yu ai lam bai galaw sa wa na re.""  This translates to ""...and as a result of the laws passed in 2015 and 2016 related to the rapdaw issue, they ultimately rejected HJR-3.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gindai bung ai hpung hpe shawng lam hta gawde lu na ahkang** (Strengthening the powers of the current parliament) - The passage doesn't discuss strengthening parliamentary powers.
* **C: Hkyak hkyak upadi zup hpawng** (Creating new laws quickly) - The passage focuses on the rejection of a specific resolution (HJR-3), not the speed of lawmaking.
* **D: Gindai bung ai hpung ni hpe hkum shadang ai lam** (Laws related to the current parliament) - The passage doesn't focus on laws *about* the parliament itself, but on a resolution related to a broader issue (""rapdaw nta lahkawng yan"").



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun dai ai hte maren, lahkawng lang na ari dam jahkrat masat ai lamhpe galoi shaprai kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: 2011 ning hta** (In 2011).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rapdaw nta lahkawng yan gaw yaw shada ai garam lajang ai lam ni hpe **shaning 2011 kaw shagrin da lai wa sai re.**""  This directly translates to ""This law regarding the rapdaw (likely a specific policy/regulation) was passed in **2011**.""

The question asks about when the law was *passed*.  Therefore, 2011 is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Upadi zup hpawng galaw ai shaloi:** (The time the law was amended) The passage mentions amendments later (2015/2016) but the question asks about the initial passing.
* **C: Bat hpang langai ya shani:** (What the legislative assembly did) While the assembly is mentioned, the focus is on *when* the law happened, not *what* they did.
* **D: 2015 ning hta:** (In 2015) This refers to later amendments, not the original passing of the law.



"
"""""""Panama Laika pa ni gaw"""" kadai ni kaw chyam bra mat ai rai?""","The correct answer is **A: Mossack Fonseka hpaga hpung**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Panama Laika pa"""""""" ngu ai gaw Mossack Fonseka a Panama tara upadi kaw na wan shi hku re ai...""  This directly translates to ""The 'Panama Leaks' were revealed by Mossack Fonseca, a law firm in Panama...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Htang dip shara** - This means ""stock market"" and is not mentioned as the source of the leaks.
*   **C: Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum** - While Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum *received* the data (according to The Guardian), they didn't *reveal* the leaks.
*   **D: Iceland amung up asuya ningbaw ni** - Iceland is mentioned as being involved *because* of the leaks, not as the source.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, British shiga dap hku nna aja tsun ai lusu ai hpe makoi magap lai wa sai hpaga hpung law malawng hpe hparan taw ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""British shi laika The Guardian gaw Deutsche Gumhpraw dum gaw ndai hpe awngdang da ga ai kawp sha nga ai kompani 1200 a htam masum na htam mi hpe jum tek da ai nga na shiga shapru da sai."" 

This translates to: ""The British newspaper The Guardian revealed information obtained from Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum, exposing over 1200 companies.""

The question asks which organization the British newspaper relied on to get the information. The passage explicitly states it was Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum.



"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai nbungli di hkrat ai lam ni hta gara wa gaw si sum ai lam grau law ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Armenia kaw na Iran lam kaw nbungli di hkrat ai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Armenia de sa ai pyenli hkrat ai lam gaw masha marai 168 hpe si shangun ai majaw Iran gaw sawng dik htum ai tsinyam hpe hkrum hkra ai.""  This directly translates to ""The conflict involving the people from Armenia caused 168 deaths, and Iran suffered two significant losses."" This clearly indicates conflict *from* Armenia *to* Iran.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iran kaw na Armenia lam kaw nbungli di hkrat ai** - The passage describes the conflict originating in Armenia, not the other way around.
* **B: Hpyen dap nbung li di hkrat ai** - While the passage mentions ""hpyen dap,"" it doesn't state that *this* is the core of the conflict being described.
* **D: Mashhad hta nbungli di hkrat ai** - Mashhad is mentioned as a location where people gathered and mourned, not where the conflict itself happened.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw Iran hta byin ai nbungli di hkrat ai shoihpa law malawng a madi madun ai lam nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shawa hte hpyen dap na nbungli dingsa ni** (The place where the people were killed and buried).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the text is about a place where people were killed (""masha matsum tsi ai ngut nna masum hkala ai"") and buried (""garam lajang ai lam nau"").  It connects this to Mashahad and describes the location as a place of suffering and death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nbungli nnan mari na matu gumhpraw n nga ai** (The reason people were killed) - The passage *mentions* killing, but doesn't focus on *why* it happened.
* **C: Nbungli nnan mari ai lam hpe pat shingdang ai lam ni** (The place where people were killed is a historical site) - While it *is* a historical site, that's not the primary focus of the passage.
* **D: Hkangreng ai lam nhkrak ai nbungli ni** (A place of suffering) - While the place is certainly suffering, this is a description *of* the place, not what the passage is *about*.



"
Npu e jaw da ai hta na Iraq Sawk Tam Hpung a sumtang laika hta nlawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Galai shai ai lam nkau mi lawm ai ndau shana laika hte, Iraq kata na dawsa ai lam ni hpe koi gam lu ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai gaw lam mahkrun ni kalang ta galai shai ai lam hpe shadut taw nga ai re."" This translates to ""This is about covering up the truth and the problems Iraq is facing."" This directly relates to concealing issues within Iraq and the challenges the country is dealing with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ya na policy hpe dinglun ai** - The passage mentions policy briefly in relation to the US and police involvement but isn't the main focus of what's being concealed.
*   **C: Iraq lamu ga jarit hpe makawp maga na matu hpaji jaw ai lam ni** - While the passage mentions the number of planes, the concealing is about *what* they are doing, not the fact they are present.
*   **D: US hte myit hkrum lam la ai hpyi shawn ai lam** - The US involvement is mentioned, but again, it's the covering up of Iraqi issues that is the central point.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kadai mung makawp maga ai npu kaw nnga ai ngu sadi jaw ai re. ...makam masham langai hte langai tsat hkat ai ni hpe kadai mung nlu jahkring ai gaw kadai mung makawp maga ai npu kaw nnga ai ngu sadi jaw ai re."" This directly translates to ""the reason for the difficulty is because of the damage... and the difficulty in finding safe passage/routes.""  Essentially, the difficulty stems from the *damaged* areas, which is related to what happened *during* the conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lam mahkrun ni hpe kalang ta galai shai ai** -  This refers to the difficulties of covering the story, not the *reason* for the difficulty itself.
* **C: Hkrang hkrang re nna dangrang hkat ai lam hpe jai lang na** - This is about the long and challenging journey, but not the core cause of the difficulty.
* **D: Sum tsan kasa kanawn mazum ai lam hpe ningnan bai galaw na lam** - This discusses aid organizations, not the fundamental problem reporters are facing.



"
"Hpyen la ni tsun ai hte maren, Provenzano a hkra lata masha gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pya da ni tsun ai gaw Lo Piccolo kaw ntsa lata nga ai hpamajaw nga yang shi kaw Palermo kaw Provenzano's right-hand man nga ai ngut nna shi a mahkrum madup kaja gaw lawban dingla ni a hkung ka hpe lu ai re shanhte gaw shanhte bungli ni hpe ngun shaja ai hta provenzano's policy hpe manu ahpa hte sha lu mari ai majaw re.""  This translates to ""This person is a key figure who, along with Lo Piccolo, as Provenzano's right-hand man...""

Therefore, Lo Piccolo is identified as being closely associated with Provenzano. The question asks who Provenzano's *masha* (key figure/right-hand man) is, and the text directly links Lo Piccolo to that role.



"
"Matsing masa gayan hta jaw da ai lam ni hta mahta nna, Falcone a si hkrum ai lam gaw hpa majaw rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw Riina-driven majan laman hta sat hkrum ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1992 ning hta Mafia a nhkru ai Falkone hte Paolo Borsellino ni a asak hkrat sum shangun ai Riina majan ngut mat ai hpang ndai sut du kaba ni hpe Provenzano gaw up hkang lai wa sai.""  This translates to: ""In 1992, Provenzano helped escape the men who killed Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, who were killed by Riina.""

This directly implies Falcone's death was driven by Riina. Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information presented in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi hpe hpyen la ni sat kau** - The passage doesn't mention anyone trying to avenge Falcone.
* **C: Lo Piccolo gaw shi hpe sat na matu aming jaw ai** - Lo Piccolo is mentioned as an associate, but not as someone involved in Falcone's death.
* **D: Shi gaw Mafia hpung a hpang hkan Paolo Borsellina a ta hta sat hkrum ai** - While both Falcone and Borsellino were killed, the passage specifically links Riina to *both* deaths, not just Borsellino's.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Hitoshi Saito a share shagan masat ni rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Japan Judo ginjaw yawng a tingyang up**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shi gaw Chanun shani hta Osaka hta asak si mat ai. Moi na Olympic hte Mungkan ningtawn ninghkrin wa rai nga ai Saito gaw shi si ai aten hta **Japan Judo ginjaw hpaji shakat jawng kompti yawng a tingyang up galaw nga lai wa ai re.**""

This directly translates to: ""...Saito, who competed in the Olympics and world championships, **was a symbol of strength for the Japan Judo Association**.""  This means his death was a significant loss *to the Japan Judo Association*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mungkan a lahkawng lang ningtawn ninghkrin wa** - While he did compete in world championships, this isn't the main focus of the sentence describing his legacy.
*   **C: Olympic hta ja dazik lahkawng lang lu ai wa** -  He competed in the Olympics, but the passage emphasizes his impact on *Japanese Judo* more than his Olympic results.
*   **D: Judo ninghkrin** - Too broad. The passage is specific about his impact on the *Japan Judo ginjaw* (association).



"
Iwasaki gaw gara shara kaw ga sadi ni hpe tawt lai lu mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Japan mung**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iwasaki gaw shi a hkrun lam kadun laman shara law law kaw manghkang amyu myu hkrum sha lai wa sai.""  This translates to ""Iwasaki came from a place called Japan.""
* The rest of the passage describes his travels *to* Tibet, Nepal, and Kala, but doesn't say he *originated* from those places.

Therefore, Iwasaki is from Japan.



"
Iwasaki hpe kadai gasat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi a byin wa mai ai ningrum ningtau**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iwasaki gaw shi a hkrun lam kadun laman..."" (Iwasaki is a person who travels/roams around...)
* **The question asks:** What is Iwasaki known for?
* **Option A (""Shi a byin wa mai ai ningrum ningtau"") translates to:** ""He/She doesn't stay in one place/is a wanderer."" This directly reflects the information in the passage about Iwasaki traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Palai ntsa na damya:** (Meaning is unclear, doesn't relate to the passage)
* **C: Gwi langai:** (Tibet) - While the passage *mentions* Tibet, it doesn't say Iwasaki *is* from Tibet.
* **D: Hpyen la:** (Meaning is unclear, doesn't relate to the passage)



"
Alonson gaw shi a mawdaw shing jawng lam hpe galoi jahkring kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Schumacher gaw shi a shingjawng poi hpe shi nan jahtum kau ngut ai hpang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Michael Schumacher gaw shi na shingjawng ai lam hpe Alonso ngut ai hpang nna shi yang shagut wa ai..."" This directly translates to ""Michael Schumacher, because Alonso was following his racing line, he also followed it..."" meaning Schumacher's line was being *copied* or *followed* by Alonso.  ""Jahtum kau ngut ai"" means to follow or copy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say Schumacher was causing problems. It says Alonso *followed* Schumacher.
* **B:** The passage focuses on Alonso following Schumacher, not Fisichella affecting Alonso.
* **D:** This is a very general statement and doesn't relate to the specific information about Alonso and Schumacher in the passage.



"
Schumacher gaw shi a shingjawng poi hpe jau shangut kau ra ai hpa majaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw shi a mawdaw hpe n dang hkang mat ai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Michael Schumacher gaw shi na shingjawng ai lam hpe Alonso ngut ai hpang nna shi yang shagut wa ai..."" This translates to ""Michael Schumacher, seeing that Alonso was taking the lead, also tried to overtake him...""  This directly means Schumacher attempted to *overtake* (jau shangut kau) his *position* (shingjawng poi).  ""N dang hkang mat ai"" means ""tried to overtake"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alonso hte adawt hkrup ai** - The passage doesn't mention Schumacher collaborating with Alonso.
* **C: Fisichella a majaw dingsen hten mat ai** - The passage doesn't say Schumacher was influenced by Fisichella.
* **D: Mawdaw jahkring ai ladat hten mat ai** - The passage doesn't suggest Schumacher was merely following the race.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, rim hkrum ai ni a matu kadai ni gaw pahkam hkam ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Tara rung munggyi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tara madung gaw gumhpraw chyhkrat ai, sadi jaw yang, ngut nna ayang gaw dai gumhpraw hpe pyada kaw na chyhkrat ai."" This translates to ""The defendant committed a crime, and even though it was a minor offense, they were able to get a plea deal.""  The passage then continues to explain how this plea deal was entered into the state computer system.  Therefore, the key point is the *plea deal* or ""tara rung"" being accepted.  ""Munggyi"" means accepted or approved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rimrawng ai balik du** - This means ""returning a wrong result"" and isn't related to the passage's context.
*   **B: Glynn tara agyi** - This means ""Judge Glynn's decision"" but doesn't capture the central idea of the plea being accepted.
*   **C: Ginjaw kaw na madi shadaw ai wa** - This means ""someone who is in trouble with the law"" and describes the defendant, not the result of the case.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai jahkring rim rawng da ai lam hta hkan nna, rim hkrum na ni hpe aten 24 hta jan na rim rawng na matu hpa ahkang ni jaw da rai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Gumhpraw chyhkrat ya ai (The trial was postponed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tara madung gaw gumhpraw chyhkrat ai, sadi jaw yang, ngut nna ayang gaw dai gumhpraw hpe pyada kaw na chyhkrat ai.""  This directly translates to ""The hearing was postponed, and even though it was scheduled for today, the hearing was postponed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pyada hte hkrum shaga ai (Postponed and a date was set):** While the hearing *was* postponed, the passage doesn't explicitly say a new date was set. It only mentions a potential future date based on the computer system.
* **C: Glynn tara agyi ni hku nna tara shang jahkrat ai tara (Judge Glynn's decision to upload it to the system):** This refers to a separate action (uploading to the computer system) and isn’t the primary result discussed in the context of the question.
* **D: Na la ai (It's not):** This is a negative and doesn’t reflect the information given in the passage.



"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, galaw taw nga lam ni hpe matut n galaw sai lam sanglang dan na matu gara madi madun ai lam hpe n jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shim lam hte seng nna hkra machyi na lam nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the difficulties and suffering faced by Afghans.** It highlights displacement, loss, and a generally bleak situation.
* **The question (Q) asks about what contributes to the continuation of these difficulties.** 
* **Option A (""Shim lam hte seng nna hkra machyi na lam nga ai"" - ""Things remain difficult and people continue to suffer"")** directly reflects the core message of the passage – the ongoing hardship experienced by the Afghan people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Npawt nhpang gawda tara upadi a nhtan shai ai lam (""The legal system favors powerful people"")** - While potentially a contributing factor, the passage doesn’t specifically focus on legal issues.
* **C: Tsaw ai jai gumhpraw (""Just giving help"")** -  Help is needed, but the question asks *why* the problems continue, not how to solve them.
* **D: Npawt nhpang upadi hte seng nna lachyum ndan leng ai lam (""Powerful people and the legal system continue to cause suffering"")** - Similar to B, this is a potential issue but not the central theme of the passage.



Therefore, **A** best captures the overall sentiment and implied reasoning within the provided text."
Hpang jahtum hta sumtsan kasa ni gaw gawlaw taw nga ai ni hpe hpa majaw n ra sai ngu sawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Npawt nhpang gawda tara upadi hta luchyum ndan leng ai lam nga ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Kahtap shingjawng na jahkring sai nga tsun da ai ndai htai lai ai lam ni hpe tau na tsun shapraw ai gaw mungdan gawda tara hte nhtan shai mai nga ai."" This translates to: ""The reason those who were previously involved were brought to justice is because of government and law enforcement.""  This directly points to the government using legal methods (upadi hta luchyum) to address the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw npawt nhpang upadi hte n hten shai ai** (This is about the situation being related to government and law, but doesn't explain *how* it was addressed) - Too general.
* **B: Dai hta shim lam hte seng nna hkra machyi na lam nga ai** (This is about problems and difficulties arising) - The passage doesn't focus on *problems* arising from the situation, but on its *resolution*.
* **D: Ningbaw ra lata poi gaw jarik grai tsaw ai** (This is about responsibility and blame) - While responsibility might be implied, the passage focuses on the *action* taken (legal process).

Therefore, option **C** is the most accurate and directly answers the question based on the information provided in the passage.



"
FATA na matu kadai gaw tara magam hte seng na karum madi shadaw ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Mung masa hte seng ai dat kasa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...FATA hpe up hkang na matu shatsam dat ai. Ndai dat kasa ni gaw Pakistan mungdan gaw da tara a daw kaji 247 npu na asuya hte tara na matu lit nga ai.""  This translates to ""...FATA was formed by merging areas. This area was under British rule for 247 years and then became part of Pakistan.""
* **Therefore:** The area that formed FATA was previously a region under British rule *and* a region considered ""mung masa hte seng ai dat kasa"" (areas historically held by different groups/tribes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pakistani asuya:** While FATA is *now* part of Pakistan, the passage focuses on its *previous* state before becoming part of Pakistan.
* **C: Pakistan mungdan a gumsan magam:** This refers to a specific designation (""Mung masa dat kasa ni hpe 'Mung masa gumsan magam' ginra ni hpe madu""), but isn't the core answer to *what* FATA was formed from.
* **D: British asuya:**  British rule is mentioned, but the passage also highlights the pre-existing ""mung masa"" (tribal/historical) nature of the area.



"
"Lawu kaw e tsun da ai ni hta, gara gaw FATA na mung masa hte seng nna n teng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw tara magam hte seng ai lam hpe karum madi shadaw ya ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shaning 1947 kaw British ni up hkang ai kata kaw na Pakistan ni shang lawt lu hpang kaw na gaw, Pakistan Gumsan magam gaw """"""""Mung masa dat kasa ni hpe"""""""" ginra ni hpe madu hku na up hkang taw FATA hpe up hkang na matu shatsam dat ai.""  This translates to: ""After the British left in 1947, the areas that joined Pakistan were governed by 'Mung masa dat kasa ni' (a local administrative system) which was then extended to FATA.""
* **The question asks:** What was the reason FATA was administered like this?
* **Option A** translates to: ""The Shan people were living under the rule of local customs."" This aligns with the passage stating FATA adopted the existing 'Mung masa dat kasa ni' system.  The passage implies this system reflected local traditions and governance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  ""Shanhte hpe Pakistan gumsan magam hku nna lata da ai rai nga ai"" (The Shan people were brought under Pakistan's military administration) - The passage doesn't mention military administration, it speaks of a local administrative system.
* **C:** ""Shanhte gaw Pakistan a npawt nhpang upadi hpe madat mara ai"" (The Shan people opposed Pakistan's legal system) -  The passage doesn't discuss opposition to legal systems.
* **D:** ""Shanhte gaw shara nkau mi hta up hkang lu nga ai"" (The Shan people lived in mountainous regions) - While true, this isn't *why* FATA was administered in a certain way. It's a geographical fact, not a reason for governance.



"
Emma Stone gaw gara shagrau kumhpa na matu tang shawn da ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkrak dik ai sumla hkrung shayi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gosling hte Stone gaw Ningtawn dik Sumla hkrung shadang hte **shayi hku na yaw shada lata da ai kaw lawm ma ai**."" This translates to ""Gosling and Stone are known to be successful and **have a good relationship** during the *La La Land* production."" 

The question asks what Emma Stone is known for in relation to the film.  A good relationship (shayi hku na) is the correct answer.



"
"Sumla hkrung gaw, gara shagrau kumhpa na matu mying tang shawn da n hkrum ai kun?","The correct answer is **D: Hkrak dik ai ningpawt madung mahkawn**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that the songs ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" and ""City of Stars"" were *key* to Gosling and Stone winning awards. It states they were ""hkrak htum kasi madung mahkawn ni hta na langai hku nna mying shawn ai hta lawm lai wa sai"" - meaning they were instrumental in helping them win awards. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hkrak dik ai sumla** - Too general. The passage focuses on *how* the songs helped, not just that they were key.
* **B: Hkrak dik ai hkrangmu ladat** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the songs being about romance.
* **C: Hkrak dik ai yungwi gayau ai lam** -  The passage doesn’t specifically link the songs to storytelling.



"
Lawu kaw na gara ni gaw n-nang nawn byin ngut ai hpang matut ngam taw ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Ishikawa kaw na nbungli daru**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lam nkau mi gaw hten za mat ai, wanleng hkawm ai shara nkau mi pat shingdang hkrum ai hte **Ishikawa uphkang ginwang na Noto Nbungli daru** gaw naw pat tawn ai re.""  This translates to ""The damage situation is unclear, many areas are still being surveyed, and **Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture** is severely affected.""

The question asks about the areas most impacted. The text specifically highlights the devastation in Ishikawa Prefecture's Noto Peninsula.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hokuriku's Shika jak rung na shingja dat kabaw bunghkraw ni yawng:** While the passage mentions Shika, it's about damage to power plants, not overall impact.
*   **C: Wanleng hkawm ai magam bungli yawng:** This refers to areas still being surveyed, not necessarily the *most* affected.
*   **D: Niigata kaw na n-gun jak rung langai:** The passage mentions Niigata, but the focus is on concerns about the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, not widespread damage *to* Niigata itself.

"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw n-nang nawn a majaw hten za ai lam hpe hkam jan lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lam nkau mi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lam nkau mi gaw hten za mat ai, wanleng hkawm ai shara nkau mi pat shingdang hkrum ai..."" which translates to ""The damage to homes is still being assessed, and many homes in the areas combined are collapsing...""  The question asks about what is being assessed as still happening/ongoing damage. Therefore, ""Lam nkau mi"" (damage to homes) is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dum nta nkau mi:** This refers to the number of people evacuated, not ongoing damage.
* **B: Shika jak rung kaw na shingja dat kabaw bunghkraw lahkawng:** This refers to the Shika peninsula and the earthquake damage there - a specific location, not the general ongoing assessment.
* **D: Noto nbungli daru:** This refers to the Noto peninsula and the collapsed roads – a specific issue, not the general ongoing assessment.

"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara manghkang ni gaw matsing ningting laika hta n lawm ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Yerusalem a htawm hpang shawng lam**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the dispute over Jerusalem, stating it's the core issue (""mungdan hte Yawdan Hka masawn mabyin ni a matu htawm hpang na chyoi pra ai shara Yerusalem mare kaba ngu ka shalawm da ma ai"").  The conflict revolves around who controls and has rights to Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 1967 majan a byin ninghpang:** While 1967 is mentioned as a starting point for the occupation, it's not the *core* of the ongoing conflict described in the passage.
* **C: Hka masawn hta hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam:** This is too broad. The passage specifically centers on Jerusalem.
* **D: Ga jarit hte seng nna htai lai hkat ai lam:** This refers to the broader Palestinian struggle, but the passage narrows the focus to Jerusalem.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Palestine a hpyi shawn ai lam kaw na langai mi n re ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Majan garai n byin shi ten hta na ga jarit** (The issue of borders since 1967).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Shabrawng mat ai shiga hte maren matsing ninghting laika kaw nna ga jarit htai lai hkat ai dai Palestine ni ra sharawng ai gaw moi 1967 na Sinpraw ka'ang majan garai nbyin shi ai kaw na re lam hpe lakap na matsun mat na re.""  This directly translates to: ""The core issue concerning the Palestinian territories is the borders that emerged after the Six-Day War of 1967.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yawdan hka masawn kaw na galaw nga ding ngam hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam** (The issue of the West Bank and Gaza Strip being occupied territories) - While occupation *is* a part of the conflict, the passage focuses on the *resulting borders* as the core issue.
* **C: Yerusalem a htawm hpang shawng lam hte seng nna mahtai ni** (The issue of control over the holy sites in Jerusalem) - Jerusalem is mentioned, but as a part of the broader border issue, not the central problem itself.
* **D: Yawdan hka masawn hta manga ning hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam** (The issue of the West Bank and Gaza Strip being occupied territories) - Same as option B; occupation is related, but not the *primary* issue the passage identifies.



"
Ma gaw gara mung hta tara upadi hpe sharin hka ja la wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: America mung**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kalang ta American kaw dingyang shanu nga na ahkang jaw lak mat(mai nga ai Card) hpe lang da ai."" This translates to ""…using an American credit card.""  Later it says, ""Ma gaw kanu mungdang Miwa mung a htep lahti madi shadaw tsun karum rum ai lam hte atsawm dang kau lu ai.""  This indicates Miwa is *involved* but not the primary source of the sharing. The initial statement directly links the sharing to an *American* card.

Therefore, Ma shared the information using an American card.



"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan gara hpe madi shadaw ai lam gaw MA na ra lata poi awng padang hpe karum ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Miwa mung**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Ma gaw kanu mungdang **Miwa mung** a htep lahti madi shadaw tsun karum rum ai lam hte atsawm dang kau lu ai.""  This translates to ""...Ma often discusses things related to **Miwa mung** and appears to be deeply involved with it.""

The question asks where the things Ma frequently discusses and is involved with originate from.  Therefore, **Miwa mung** is the correct answer.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Caolyn Wilson gaw mare kaw na n pru shi ai shaloi, kade a matu bungli galaw lai wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...OHA a Carolyn Wilson gaw shanhte a tau jaw da ai jaram gumphraw ni hpe lagu la nna mare kaw na hprawng mat sai hpe kalang ta dum mat ai."" This directly translates to ""OHA and Carolyn Wilson were involved in the issue of the land that the Shan people claim...""  Therefore, Carolyn Wilson is associated with OHA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinpraw Bay Mung shawa Upadi Zupra:** This is mentioned as a place the passage is about, but doesn't relate to Carolyn Wilson directly.
* **B: Oakland balit:**  Lockwood is associated with Oakland, not Carolyn Wilson.
* **D: Lockwood nampan sun:** Lockwood is mentioned, but doesn't have a direct connection to Carolyn Wilson.



"
"Ndai numdaw hta mali lang shingjawng na lam naw ngam ai hte, kadai wa gaw Mawdaw gau shingjawng poi hta nambat mali rai taw ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: Stewart**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth hte Harvick ni gaw ndai numdaw hta mali lang shingjawng na naw ngam ai...""  This directly answers the first part of the question (""Ndai numdaw hta mali lang shingjawng na lam naw ngam ai"").

The question also asks ""...kadai wa gaw Mawdaw gau shingjawng poi hta nambat mali rai taw ai kun?""  While several drivers are mentioned, the passage focuses on Stewart *along with* Gordon, Kenseth, and Harvick as being in a difficult position in the Mawdaw (Cup) standings.



"
"Laika daw hta matut manoi tsun da shing jawng poi hta, mawdaw shingjawng ai lam hta Kahne gaw a mat kade lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. ni gaw manga hte kru shara kaw 2,220 hte 2,207 amat ni lu da ma ai.""  This translates to ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. were among those who didn't finish well, with scores of 2,220 and 2,207 respectively.""

The question asks for Kahne's score. While 2,220 is mentioned alongside Kahne, 2,207 is *his* specific score.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpang de martian madung re ngu sawk sagaw lu ai wanhkut lung ni hpe, masha ni kade lang myi mu ga sai rai?","The passage states: ""Masha ni lamu kaw na martian arung arai mungkan de hkrat wa yang chemical hku hpa byin wa na hpe sagawn ai dai lam gaw labau hta manga lang rai na re ngu shadu lai wa sai.""  This translates to something like: ""Masha is investigating whether the Martian chemicals found are causing problems, and the initial findings suggest it *might* be.""  

The question asks about the likelihood of the discovered remains being Martian.  The passage indicates it's a possibility (""arung arai"" - some are) but doesn't confirm it definitively. ""Manga lang"" means ""might be,"" which aligns with the tentative findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: manga lang**.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai zawn, madung hta martian ngu sawk sagawn lu ai nlung ni hte seng nna gara wa jaw ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Dai nlung ni yawng hpe, July wanhkut madun ai** (This incident happened during the July floods).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai lung rawk shi manga hpe July hpang jahtum hta shagan wanhkut lung madun ai."" This directly translates to ""This incident was caused by the floods in July.""
* The question asks *when* the incident (martian sightings) happened.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nlung 24,000 re** (Number 24,000) - This refers to the amount of damage, not *when* it happened.
* **C: Nlung dai ni gaw ja hta grau nna US dollar gumhpraw 11,000 ging dan ai** (This incident cost between US dollar 11,000) - This is about the financial cost, not the timing.
* **D: Nlung 34 re** (Number 34) - This refers to the number of Martians sighted, not *when* it happened.



"
Schumacher gaw galoi hkring sa mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Felipse Massa mawdaw adawt ngut ai hpang**.

Here's why:

The passage states Schumacher helped Felipe Massa, who was in a difficult situation after an accident in 2006. The question asks *how* Schumacher helped, and the passage clearly indicates it was by supporting Massa. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi a sanit lang na ninghkrin shingjawng poi ngut ai hpang:** The passage doesn’t say Schumacher helped with his own retirement.
* **C: Felipe Massa hpe galai ngut ai hpang:** While he supported Massa, the passage focuses on helping him *after* an accident, not generally.
* **D: 2009 ladaw jahtum hta:** This refers to an event *involving* Massa, but doesn't explain how Schumacher helped.



"
Massa galoi hkumhkrang machyi hkra la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Formula 1 ninghkrin shingjawng poi dang ngut ai hpang**.

Here's why:

The text states Massa ""was seriously injured in a Formula 1 accident"" (Formula 1 ninghkrin shingjawng poi dang ngut ai hpang) during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. The question asks *how* Massa was injured. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Grand Pix laman hta** - While the injury happened *at* a Grand Prix, this doesn’t explain *how* he was injured.
*   **C: Schumacher galai n hkring shi yang** - Schumacher is mentioned, but his actions didn't directly cause Massa's injury.
*   **D: 2009 ladaw shawng hta** - This refers to *when* the injury occurred, not *how*.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, hkyen lajang ai lam gaw AOL hpe gara hku akyu jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: AOL hpe jai lang ai masha ni gaw Yahoo hte Microsoft hpe jai lang ai masha ni hte shingjawng manang rai wa na**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yahoo! hte Microsoft hpe jai lang ai masha shadang pawng dat yang gaw AOL jai lang ai masha shadang hpe shing jawng mai wa na re."" This directly translates to ""The market share of Yahoo! and Microsoft combined is almost the same as the market share of AOL.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL hpe jai lang ai masha ni law wa na lam nga ai:**  The passage doesn't focus on *why* people use AOL, just its market share.
* **B: AOL gaw IM gat lawk bungli hpe galaw ai, langai sha nga ai hpaga hpung byin wa na:** While AOL *did* provide instant messaging, this isn't the core point of the passage. The passage is about market share.
* **D: United States hta AOL hpe n jai lang wa na re:** The passage states AOL *was* used widely, but the question asks about what caused that usage – the answer is its comparable market share to other giants.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, hkyen lajang ai lam ningnan hpe jahtum kau mai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: United States hta chyam bra wa ai internet bawng ring lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on AOL's dominance in the early days of internet usage in the United States.** It states AOL was a major force (""chyam bra hkra"") and widely used (""lang nga ai majaw de shara hta nan"").  The question asks about the *general context* of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: IM gat lawk hpe jai lang ai lam (The use of instant messaging)** - While IM is *mentioned* as something AOL offered, it's not the central topic.
* **C: AOL gaw shi a shara hta gat lawk hpe madu ra ai hku galaw lu ai ahkang (How AOL attracted users with free hours)** - This is a *detail* within the larger context of AOL's internet dominance.
* **D: Yahoo hte Microsoft a rau galaw lam (The competition with Yahoo and Microsoft)** -  This is also a detail; the passage states they *followed* AOL's lead, not that the competition is the main subject.



"
"Htim gasat ai hta asak si hkrum ai kaw na, pyada du n rai ai marai kade rai?","The passage states: ""Pyada la wa tsun lai wa ai gaw, shanhte gaw htim gasat ai na matu lit nga ai ngu shadu da ai gasat myit rawt ai Daesh (ISIL) hpe nrup nsen ai re.""  This translates to: ""The reason for the attack was to retaliate against Daesh (ISIL) who carried out attacks on their villages that caused many casualties.""

The question asks: ""How many attacks are mentioned as the reason for the retaliation?""

The passage only mentions *one* type of attack - those carried out by Daesh (ISIL) on villages. While many casualties resulted, it's still referring to a single source of attacks.  Therefore, the answer is **B: 2**.

However, the passage mentions ""many casualties"" (matu lit nga ai) which could indicate several attacks. Given the wording and options, **B: 2** seems to be the closest logical interpretation, even though the passage doesn't explicitly state a specific number.

**Important Note:** The original passage and question are in Jinghpaw (Kachin) language. My translation and answer are based on that understanding. There may be nuances lost in translation."
Htim gasat ai kaw na nrup ntsen ai wa hpe kadai shiga jaw dat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shiga htawn ai ni** (Those involved in the incident).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""shanhte gaw htim gasat ai na matu lit nga ai gasat myit rawt ai Daesh (ISIL) hpe nrup nsen ai re.""  This translates to ""The perpetrators of the incident were found to be related to Daesh (ISIL), who are known for their violent actions.""
* **The question asks:** Who is being investigated for the incident?
* Therefore, the answer is those *involved in the incident* – the perpetrators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pyada (Attack):**  The question asks *who* is being investigated, not *what* happened.
* **B: munggyi rung (something happened):** Too vague.
* **D: Gaziantep buga masha ni (Gaziantep people):** The passage doesn't indicate the entire population of Gaziantep is under investigation, only those responsible for the attack.



"
"Florida na dang ai wa mungdaw yawng la madang a majaw, Mitt Romney hpe hpa kumhpa shagrau ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mungdan yawng a ahkang aya** (The number of votes Newt Gingrich received).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Galoi mung na U.S Rapdaw Tingnyang up Newt Gingrich gaw tsa lam shadang 32 hte nambat lahkawng kaw hkan ai.""  This translates to ""And U.S. Representative Newt Gingrich received 32 votes.""  The question asks what caused Romney to win – it was because Gingrich took votes *away* from him. The number of votes Gingrich got represents the votes Romney *didn't* get.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ahkang aya 32** - While true, this is Gingrich's vote count, not what helped Romney win.
*   **B: Republican Pati na matu mying tang shaw da ai lam** - This refers to Florida being important for the Republican party, but doesn’t explain *how* Romney won.
*   **D: Ra lata me a tsa lam shadang 46** - This is Romney's vote count, not what helped him win.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, ra lata poi hta Gingrich kaw tsa lam kaw na me kade ram nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: tsa lam shadang 32**.

The text states: ""Galoi mung na U.S Rapdaw Tingnyang up Newt Gingrich gaw tsa lam shadang 32 hte nambat lahkawng kaw hkan ai.""  This directly answers the question about how many votes Gingrich received.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mung masa pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng na mahtai chye ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw matut nna hpang n hkan mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Perry**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Perry tsun mat ai gaw shi hku nna """""""" Texas de dai na na mung mas pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng a mahtai hpe lu la na matu hte nye ai matu ndai shingjawng ai lam kaw matut hkam na lam nga n-nga hpe jep jen na matu bai nhtang wa na re"""""""""".  This directly translates to Perry being discussed in relation to a strong campaign and fundraising in Texas.

The question asks which candidate is described as having a strong fundraising base, especially from Texas. Perry is the only candidate mentioned in that context.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mung masa pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng na mahtai chye ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw kaga shang shingjawng ai wa a lam hpe tak kaba tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Perry**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Perry tsun mat ai gaw shi hku nna """""""" Texas de dai na na mung mas pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng a mahtai hpe lu la na matu hte nye ai matu ndai shingjawng ai lam kaw matut hkam na lam nga n-nga hpe jep jen na matu bai nhtang wa na re"""""""""".  This directly translates to ""Perry's downfall was that he was a Texas native and tried to portray himself as an outsider while actually being a product of the Texas political establishment."" This aligns perfectly with the question asking about someone who tried to portray themselves as something they weren't regarding a political background.



"
"2015 ning a shawng shaning e, dai lamang madun ai shara gaw gara kaw rai?","The correct answer is **C: AstroNet Radio**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sjaning 2015 htum wa maga de gaw, Toginet gaw AstroNet shiga shapoi jak hpe mahtawk matawn re ai redyu shapoi dap hku na gawgap hpang lai wa sai.""  This translates to ""In 2015, Toginet began broadcasting under the AstroNet network.""

Therefore, in 2015, the radio station transitioned to being part of AstroNet Radio.



"
Radio shapoi dap gaw dai lamang hpe ganing re kamung ngu htawng madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Jawng dingsa**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"""ningnan shachyai dik hkra shachyai mai ai **jawng dingsa** na radio kamung naura!"""""" which translates to ""...a radio station for people who aren't nerdy or sophisticated!"".  The question asks what kind of radio station it is, and the text directly describes it as ""jawng dingsa"" (simple/unsophisticated).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amateur:** While it *might* be amateur, the text doesn't focus on skill level, but rather simplicity.
*   **B: Geeky:** The text explicitly states it's *not* for ""nerdy"" people.
*   **D: Jauman bu ni:** This refers to the location of the station's operator, not the station's style.



"
Gasat gala myit rawt taw ai uhpung na htim gasat ai lam hpe dik shale karum ya ai hpa baw hpe David Headley mahkawng wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Sinat hpai masha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""David Headley a shiga lahkawn da ai lam gaw Pakistani hpyen hpung re ai Laskhar-e-Taiba kaw na **sinat hpai masha 10** hpe majan awngdang na matu lu karum da ai."" 

This translates to: ""The information David Headley provided led to the arrest of **10 operatives** of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba.""

Therefore, David Headley revealed information leading to the arrest of operatives.



"
Gasat gala myit rawt taw ai hpyen uhpung ni gaw Mumbai de bu hkram na matu kaning rai htaw wa htaw sa lam hpe jai lang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkali**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the attacks happened on **November 26, 2008** (""2008 November 26 ya hta du wa ai"").  The question asks about *when* the attacks occurred. Therefore, ""Hkali"" (meaning ""time"" or ""when"") is the most fitting answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wanleng punghkaw** - Means ""place"", which isn't the focus of the question.
* **B: Pyenli** - Means ""people"", irrelevant to the question.
* **D: Mawdaw** - Means ""reason"", also irrelevant to the question.



"
Laika daw hta tsun da ai Nadal hte Raonic yan a Brisbane Hpaw poi shing jawng ai lam mahtai hpe tup hkrak dawng pru ya ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic gaw Nadal hpe dang kau ai** (Raonic defeated Nadal).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shi gaw ndai laman sha Raonic hpe Brisbane hpaw poi hta sha sum da ai rai nga ai.""  This translates to ""He lost to Raonic in the Brisbane open, it seems."" This clearly indicates Raonic won *against* Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic hta 88% net amat nga ai:** The passage says Nadal had 88% first serve percentage, not Raonic.
* **C: Nadal gaw Roanic hpe dang kau ai:** This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: Raonic gaw amat 76 lu la sai:** The passage says Nadal hit 76 winners, not Raonic.



"
"Laika daw hta tsun da hte maren, ningshawng shingjawng poi ngut ai hpang Nadal hte Raonic a poi masa gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Raonic hta 88% net amat nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nadal gaw ginsup lamang 88% hta amat 76 hte shawng lu nna dang ai."" This translates to ""Nadal won 88% of the points while Raonic won 76 points.""  This directly implies Raonic won 88% of *the net* points (the points not won by Nadal).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nadal gaw amat 76 dang la sai** - The passage states Nadal *won* 76 points, not that he *lost* 76 points.
* **C: lu amat gaw 7-2 re** - The passage mentions a score of 7-2, but it doesn't specify it's about ""lu amat"" (total points). It refers to a specific game score.
* **D: Raonic gaw Nadal hpe dang kau ai** - The passage doesn't say Raonic won against Nadal; it says Nadal won.



"
Naked Shiga dap nnan masum kaw gara aga lamang n lawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain ga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...internet laika man ni hte gun hkawm mai ai jak ni a matu shabra hpang taw sai re...Spain ga, Italy ga, Korea ga lamang ni hpe hkrangmu shiga...""  This translates to ""...and among those countries that are becoming well-known through the internet and gathering information...Spain, Italy, and Korea...""  

The question asks which country is mentioned alongside Naked Shiga. The passage directly links Spain, Italy, and Korea as countries becoming known *because of* things like Naked Shiga. While Italy and Korea are mentioned, **Spain** is specifically brought up in the context of the broader discussion stemming from the initial statement about Naked Shiga.



"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Naked Shiga dap kaw na shi shana dap nnan hpe gara kaw n lu mai na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Internet**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...internet laika man ni hte gun hkawm mai ai jak ni a matu shabra hpang taw sai re"" which translates to ""...it is mostly found due to information gathered through the internet.""  This directly links the spread of information about Naked Shiga to the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sumbu phone:** The passage doesn't mention phones.
*   **C: Poi yu ginra ni:** (Things people say) - While gossip could contribute, the passage focuses on information *gathering*.
*   **D: Hkrangmu nsen:** (Newspapers) - While newspapers are a source of information, the passage specifically highlights the internet.



"
Giant Slalom hpe pandung de n lu shangut mat ai shingjawng masha kade rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Num ni shang lawm shingjawng ai uhpung kaw na hkyen jawn ai marai mali gaw shanhte a shingjawng ai lam hpe nlu shangut shakre lu ma ai rai nna hkyen jawn masha yawng **117 kaw na 45** gaw Giant Slalom kaw shingjawng poi madang tsang masat ai lam kaw hkrat sum lai wa sai re.""

This directly translates to: ""...masha of age **117, 45** were competing in the Giant Slalom...""  Therefore, 45 is the age of the skiers competing in the Giant Slalom.



"
"Lawu kaw na tsun da ai lam ni hta, gara gaw ninghkrin shingjawng poi a awng jahpan hpe tup hkrak dawng pru ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hkyen jawn marai 45 gaw Giant Slalom hta shanhte a gat shingjawng ai lam pandung hpe n lu shangut la ai.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what Carpanedo did to improve her performance.** The passage states: ""...num ni shang lawm shingjawng ai uhpung kaw na hkyen jawn masha yawng 117 kaw na 45 gaw Giant Slalom kaw shingjawng poi madang tsang masat ai lam kaw hkrat sum lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""...she diligently practiced the course, studying the 45 turns of the Giant Slalom."" This shows she studied and practiced to improve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions Hungary, it doesn't say Carpanedo practiced *with* anyone from Hungary.
* **C:** The passage doesn't focus on the difference between Slalom and Giant Slalom for Carpanedo’s improvement.
* **D:** The passage says she *did* compete in Slalom, but doesn't state that it's where she improved.



"
Lawu kaw na gara wa hpe NBA jahkring kau na matu daw dan kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Utah Jazz kaw na ginsup ninghkrin**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Utah Jazz yung ngoi ning hkring na COVID-19 virus nga ai hpe NBA dawdan ai gaw hkan sa ai."" (The Utah Jazz players who tested positive for COVID-19 caused the NBA season to be suspended.)

The question asks *what* caused the NBA suspension. The passage directly identifies the Utah Jazz players testing positive as the cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ta din ginsup numdaw** (The season was suspended) - This is *what happened*, not *why* it happened.
* **C: COVID-19 ana kap ai ginsup ninghkrin ni yawng** (COVID-19 related suspension) - Too general.  It doesn't specify *what* about COVID-19 caused the suspension.
* **D: Utah Jazz ta din ginsup uhpung** (Utah Jazz season suspended) - Incorrect. The passage states the *entire NBA* season was suspended, not just the Jazz's.



"
"Laika daw da tsun da ai zawn, lawu kaw na gara gaw virus hte seng nna NBA a myit tsang ai lam hpe byin shangun ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Utah Jazz ginsup lamang hta ginsup ninghkrin tsawmra mi ana kap ai lam** (Utah Jazz players testing positive is what started the situation).

Here's why:

* **P (the prompt)** states the NBA suspended games *because* of COVID-19, specifically triggered by players on the Utah Jazz testing positive.
* **Q (the question)** asks what *started* the NBA shutdown due to the virus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""NBA uhpung malawm ni ana kap ai lam"" (What happened with the NBA generally) - Too broad.  The question asks for the *trigger*.
* **C & D:** These are very similar and state the Jazz players testing positive *might* be what happened, with hedging language (""ngu nna mahtai lu ngut ai hpang atsawm n lu ginsup ai lam""). The prompt states it *was* the reason.

The passage states: ""Shi gaw Atlanta Thrashers hpe 5-3 hte dang ai hta goal 2 lu nna shi Washington a matu 2 lang karum ya wa ai."" This directly translates to ""He scored 2 goals against the Atlanta Thrashers in a 5-3 win, making him the 2nd player in Washington history.""

Therefore, Alex Ovechkin is the player who scored the goals against Atlanta and achieved that milestone for Washington.



"
Washington muklum hte Thrashers shingjawng poi lamang laman hta kadai wa gaw shi a numdaw 60 lang na goal hpe lu la mat sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai shana na shi a goal lahkawng ngu na gaw dai num daw a shi lu bang ai 60th ngu na goal re, Jaromir Jagr hte Mario Lemieux yan dai pandung lu du ai ten...""  This means Ovechkin scored his 60th goal, putting him in the company of Jagr and Lemieux (who previously achieved 60 goals). The question asks *who* scored the 60th goal.



"
Northern Rock gumhpraw dum gaw galoi aten hta asuya kaw karum ningtum ai hpe ra wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gumhpraw dum hpe mung shawa rai shatai la ngut ai hpang** (Because the gumhpraw dum almost completely collapsed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""2010 ning hta, mung ting mung shawa rai shatai la ai ten hta, """"""""Northern Rock"""""""" laksan gumhpraw dum hpe """"""""Nkaja ai gumhpraw dum"""""""" jahpan kaw na garan kau ai."" (In 2010, to the point of almost complete collapse, the ""Northern Rock"" loan business was rebranded as ""Nkaja ai gumhpraw dum""). This directly indicates the gumhpraw dum was on the verge of failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manu dan sutgan hparan kompani kaw na garan mat ai shaloi** (Because it became a company owned by the government) - While true later, the question asks about the *initial* reason for its downfall.
* **C: Virgin uhpung ni gumhpraw dum hpe mari ngut ai hpang** (Because Virgin tried to buy the gumhpraw dum) - Virgin *attempted* to buy it, but this wasn't the *reason* for Northern Rock's near collapse.
* **D: Hka hte hkoi shap sha ra ai chyat ladaw hta** (Because of the financial crisis of 2007/2008) -  This is a contributing factor mentioned in the text, but not the direct reason for the near collapse described in the last sentence. The passage highlights the *extent* of the collapse in 2010.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Virgin Uhpung a Northern Rock Gumhpraw Dum hte myit hkrum ai lam hpe tup hkrak tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Uhpung ma Northern Rock a manu dan rai hparan ai company hpe mari wa sai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Virgin Hpung gaw mungdan masat gumhpraw dum hpe madung galaw ai hta ninghkap hkrum ai lam loi mi nga ai."" (Virgin Group was interested in rescuing the failing mortgage business.) and ""Virgin gaw Dingdung Lung rawk a """"""""kaja ai gumhpraw dum"""""""" hpe sha mari da ai, company a reng hkang lam gaw n madu ai."" (Virgin bought the 'good' part of the mortgage business, but the company ultimately failed.)
* This directly supports the idea that Virgin *attempted* to buy/rescue Northern Rock's assets (the mortgage business).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention Virgin being a failing bank.
* **C:** The passage indicates Virgin *tried to help* Northern Rock, not that it caused its problems.
* **D:** The passage doesn't focus on nationalization or broader banking issues, just Virgin’s attempt to acquire Northern Rock’s assets.



"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Kyoto lamu marang myit hkrum hta lata masat htu ai a majaw gara mung gaw akyu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kyoto lamu marang shiga myit hkrum lam hta Mr. Rudd na lata masat htu na matu daw dan ai lam gaw United States hpe garan tawn da nga ai rai...""  This translates to: ""The issue of participating in the Kyoto Protocol, where Mr. Rudd was hesitant, was about the United States...""

Therefore, the passage identifies the United States as the country involved in the hesitation regarding the Kyoto Protocol.



"
Australia na shawng asuya gaw Kyoto na shagrin ai lam wa kadai hpe sum machyi na lam byin hkun na ngu shadu sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: United States**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kyoto lamu marang shiga myit hkrum lam hta Mr. Rudd na lata masat htu na matu daw dan ai lam gaw United States hpe garan tawn da nga ai rai...""  This translates to: ""Regarding the issue of whether or not to join the Kyoto Protocol, Mr. Rudd's position was that it depended on what the United States did...""

The question asks what Australia's position on joining Kyoto depended on. The passage directly states it depended on the United States.



"
Yi sun kaw na shan gap ginsup ai ni hpe hpa lamang a matu lata la sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia Shan Gap Ginsup Uhpung na matu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""NPWS a rau bungli galaw ai hte Australia a Shan gap Ginsup Hpung (NSW) Inc gaw Shan gap Ginsup Hpung a shan gap lamang kata na atsam ningja hpring ai daw jau masha ni hpe lata san da ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""NPWS and the Australia Shan Gap Ginsup Hpung (NSW) Inc. are working to preserve the important things related to the Shan Gap lands.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nampan sun hkang zing ai hte sali wunli lamang:** This refers to a specific location mentioned in the passage related to a meeting, not the overall preservation effort.
* **C: NPWS lamang:** While NPWS is *involved*, the passage explicitly states it's a joint effort *with* the Australia Shan Gap Ginsup Hpung.
* **D: Shan Gap Ginsup Uhpung a shan hkwi ai lamang:** This is too vague.  The passage clarifies it's the *Australia* Shan Gap Ginsup Hpung specifically involved in preservation.



"
"Lawu kaw na tsun da ai hta, yi sun ni hpe chyahten chye ai akawng ni hpe sat ai tsi hte seng nna gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shan gap ai ni hpe chye na ai ni kaw na sharin shachyen ya sai** (They are not sharing the information about those who are helping the Shan people).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Akyu byin ai rawng ai hpe jep maram let yi sun ni hpe chyhten chye ai akawng ni hpe tsat ai tsi jai lang ai lam hpe chye na ai ni kaw na sharin shachyen ya ma ai.""  This directly translates to: ""They are not sharing the information about those who are helping the Shan people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage doesn't focus on overall improvements, just the lack of information sharing.
* **B:** While the passage mentions the situation of Shan people, it doesn't say they are suffering.
* **D:** The passage doesn’t mention anything about losses incurred by the Shan people.



"
"Laika kaw tsun da hte maren, ga garan ai hpe gara kaw mu wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Rift Valley kaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...Ethiopia na Rift Valley Sawk lak Karum hpung kaw na sawk sagawn ai..."" which translates to ""...found in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia..."".  The question asks *where* the remains were found. Therefore, the Rift Valley is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Namhkan lung hta** -  This refers to ""inside the skull"" - a part of the remains, not the location of the discovery.
* **C: Molecular sakse hta** - This refers to molecular evidence, not a location.
* **D: Ethiopia kaw** - While the remains were found *in* Ethiopia, the specific location is the Rift Valley *within* Ethiopia.



"
"Laika daw hta tsun da hte maren, myit mada da ai lam hta jau na byin wa ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Molecular sakse na jep sagawn ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on molecular evidence.** The first sentence explicitly states the research is about ""molecular ni a sakse ni a nlawm ai tim jau tak da ai hta grau loi ai"" - meaning how molecular evidence helps understand things.
* **The quote from Berhane Asfaw** is context for *where* this molecular research is happening (Ethiopia's Rift Valley), but the core of the passage is about the *method* (molecular evidence).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Namhkan lung a masam maram sawk tam lu ai lam** - While ""namhkan lung"" (human origins) is a topic, the passage doesn't detail the specifics of human evolution, just the tool used to study it.
* **B: Ga garan mat ai lam** - ""Ga garan mat ai"" (things that are being discovered) is too broad. The passage is specific about *how* they are being discovered.
* **D: Rift Valley hta na sawk sagaw magam** -  The Rift Valley is the location of the research, not the subject of the research itself.



"
"Sumla hkrung ginsup ai laman hta shamu shamawt ai lam hpe jum lang na matu, ginsup ai wa gaw hpa baw galaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Up hkang ai a maju hkam hkinghku ni hpe hkalap pa hta Upshara jahkrat da na.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai gaw sumla hkrung ginsup hpan hta jak ni hpe nbung ntsa kaw shamawt nna ginsup masha ni hpe galaw ai lam hte shamu shamawt ai lam hpe uphkang lu na matu ahkang jaw nga ai re.""  This translates to: ""This means that in the gin soup that is being stirred, the way the soup is stirred and the way it's being tasted are being considered to make it delicious.""  This directly refers to considering the *taste* (shamu shamawt ai lam) of the ""stirred"" (up hkang) soup (maju hkam hkinghku).
* **Option A** reflects this: ""Up hkang ai a maju hkam hkinghku ni hpe hkalap pa hta Upshara jahkrat da na"" translates to ""Considering the taste when stirring the soup.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on *spreading* the soup, not tasting it.
* **C:** Mentions making the soup, but doesn't relate to taste.
* **D:**  Focuses on *covering* the stirred soup, not tasting.



"
TV sumtsan hkang hkinghku hte bung hkra hpa hpe shalat sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Up hkang ai a maju hkam hkinghku lahkawng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""TV sumtsan hkang hkinghku (remote) zawn controller hta mung jai lang ai wa a TV makau e man masum hkrang bawng shara la let shakap da ai maju hkam hkinghku lahkawng lawm ai."" This directly translates to: ""The TV remote control was only able to play games, but the advanced controller that came with Nintendo Revolution allowed you to point at the TV screen and select things."" 

Therefore, the question ""TV sumtsan hkang hkinghku hte bung hkra hpa hpe shalat sai rai?"" (What distinguished the TV remote from something else?) is answered by the advanced controller (""Up hkang ai a maju hkam hkinghku lahkawng"").



"
Xinhua Shiga dat kasa dap na hpang jahtum laika hta hpa hpe n tsun shapraw da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: pyenli hpe bawm jahkrit shama ai lam** (the issue of assisting/supporting refugees).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hpang daw na shiga hta lawm ai gaw, nbungli hpe bawm hte jahkrit la nna Afghanistan de nhtang gayin shangun nna Kandahar kaw wa jahkring shangun da hkrum ai.""  This translates to: ""What is mentioned in the news is that assistance and support for refugees, particularly those fleeing conflict in Afghanistan, have reached Kandahar.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Urumqi kaw pyenli yu wa sai lam** (The issue of refugees being in Urumqi) -  While Urumqi is *mentioned* as a place refugees are going, the passage doesn't focus on *that* as the main issue.
* **C: Pyenli gaw Afghanistan de nhtang kau ai lam** (Refugees are fleeing from conflict in Afghanistan) - This is *part* of the story, but the passage emphasizes the *response* to the refugee situation (help/support).
* **D: Kandahar kaw pyenli yu wa sai lam** (Refugees are being in Kandahar) -  Again, Kandahar is a location, but not the central issue the passage is addressing.



Therefore, the passage primarily discusses the *provision of help* to refugees, making option A the most accurate answer."
Xinhua shiga dat kasa na jau dik ai laika hta hpa hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Pyenli hpe zing na hpung ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Miwa shiga dap re nga ai Xinhua gaw **pyenli langai hpe zing na hpung nga ai** lam shiga jau shana da ai."" (Miwa said that Xinhua was reporting about the situation of **people fleeing**.)
* The question asks what Xinhua is reporting on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage *mentions* people traveling to Afghanistan, it doesn't say this is what Xinhua is *reporting* on.
* **C:** The passage mentions Afghanistan, but not as the main subject of Xinhua's reporting.
* **D:** The passage says people are helping, but it's not the core of what Xinhua is reporting.



"
Radio shana lamang laman hta Sara Danius hpa hpe ndau shabra wa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Laili laika hta Nobel shagrau kumhpa lu ai wa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bat hpang langai ya shani hta Sara Danius... Nobel kompti a dinggrin amu madu gaw Bob Dylan hku nna kalang ta 2016 na Laili laika Nobel shagrau kumhpa hpe lu na matu ndep hkap lu ai lam...""  This directly translates to Sara Danius being asked about Bob Dylan receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016.  The radio broadcast was *about* this event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions communication difficulties, it's not the *main* topic of what Danius was asked about on the radio.
* **C:** This is a detail *within* the broader context, but not the central question posed to Danius.
* **D:**  This is a related point (Dylan winning), but the question asks what Danius was specifically asked *about* on the radio.



"
Kadai wa hpe n lu matut mahkai lu mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Nobel Prize was awarded to Bob Dylan in 2016, and the entire text discusses the difficulties in reaching him to inform him of the award. The question asks who the passage is *about* – and that's Bob Dylan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bob Dylan na ni kahtep ai jawm galaw ai wa** - This is a fragmented phrase and not the main subject.
*   **B: Sara Danius** - Sara Danius is mentioned as the person *trying* to contact Bob Dylan, but the passage isn't *about* her.
*   **C: Swedish Dakkasu** - Swedish Dakkasu (Academy) is the organization awarding the prize, but not the subject of the passage.



"
"""Dai ga sadi gaw """"ahkrak ai numdaw"""" re ai lam hpe kadai myit ningmu shapraw wa ai rai?""","The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Gordon Johndroe ""re ai ngu tsun lai wa sai re"" (said) the statement about the ""ahkrak ai numdaw"" (difficult situation). The question asks who said the statement.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shiga dap** - This simply means ""yes"" and doesn't identify the speaker.
*   **B: George W. Bush** - The passage states Bush *received* information, he didn't *say* the quoted statement.
*   **D: North Korea a matu tsun shaga ahkang lu ai wa** - This refers to the context of the statement, not the person who made it.



"
Slania gaw mungdan amyu law malawng a matu dazik kade ram galaw shapru wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Shi gaw Sweden hte kaga mungdan 28 a matu dazik baw 1,000 jan shalet da lu sai.""  This directly translates to ""He sold 1,000 copies in 28 countries including Sweden.""

Therefore, Slania sold 1,000 copies.



"
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, tank vent kaw na kayun ai lam byin wa hkun ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Kahtet dat hte seng ai law mat ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tank vent kaw na matut lwi taw ai gaw tank kata kaw na kahtet dat law mat ai majaw re sam ai."" This directly translates to: ""...the emissions from the tank vents are also causing ice to form on the tank itself."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lahkawng ngu na sharawng bang ai shara gaw shang shadang du hkra hpring da ai** - This refers to the overall quantity of oil being transported, not the specific issue of emissions.
*   **B: Wan n-gun hkrang masa** - This mentions the system being tested, but doesn't relate to the tank vent problem.
*   **D: Fort Greely na hka chyup dap langai hta wan hkru ai lam** - This just states the location, not the problem.



"
Hpa majaw matsut hpaw mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tank kata hta kahtet ai dat law mat ai**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...tank kata kaw na kahtet dat law mat ai majaw re sam ai."" ( ""...it was found that the data leaked from the tank""). This directly answers the question of what the spill was.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ladat jep ngut ai hpang wan ngun hkrak mat ai:** While the passage mentions a leak impacting the land, it doesn't say this *is* what the spill was.
*   **C: tank ni gaw shang shadang hpring kaw rai taw ai:** The passage says the tank holds 104,500 barrels, not how much was spilled.
*   **D: Lahkawng lang na sharawng bang ai kaw wahtawng n lu tek tawn ai:**  The passage describes the pipeline's length, not the spill itself.



"
"Ndai laman, jahku ngu na mare lawk hta hka kade tsaw taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 20 pe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Katrina laru laman pe 20 daram tsaw hkra hka kaba ai hpe mu da ai jahku ngu na mare lawk gaw ya ten hta makau kaw nga ai...""  This directly translates to ""Katrina's group, 20 people were able to get the jahku at the market.""

Therefore, the question ""How many people got the jahku at the market?"" is answered by ""20 pe"" (20 people).



"
"Hurricane Katrina laman, jahku ngu na mare lawk hta hpa byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hka kaba ai gaw 20 pe tsaw ai** (The damage was around 20 buildings).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Katrina laru laman pe 20 daram tsaw hkra hka kaba ai hpe mu da ai jahku ngu na mare lawk gaw ya ten hta makau kaw nga ai...""  This directly translates to ""Hurricane Katrina damaged around 20 buildings in the areas where people were affected.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hka kaba ai gaw 100 pe dam ai** (The damage was around 100 buildings) - The passage mentions 100 *shares* (likely referring to insurance claims or aid distributed) not damaged buildings.
* **B: Ginshang-ram re hka gaw hka hkinbawng hpe taw lai mat ai** (The damage helped the state government) - The passage does not say the damage *helped* anyone.
* **D: Marang htu shadang yungnu bat 6 gaw hka hkinbawng jahten hpe tawt lai mat ai** (6 young people helped the state government) -  The passage mentions young people helping, but doesn't specify a number of 6 or that it specifically helped the state government.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Hamilton a shagrin da ai lam n rai ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Machyi masha wa bu hkawm ai shara ni** (The place where the sickness spread).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Machyi masha gaw Ebola ana zinli amu byin lai wa ai shara rai nga ai Nigeria mungdan de du hkawm lai wa sai.""  This directly translates to ""The sickness spread in Nigeria, a place where Ebola was found.""
* **The question asks:** What did Hamilton worry about? The passage says Hamilton worried about where the sickness was spreading *to*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kaga machyi masha na ana zingli hte hkra ai lam byin na masa** (What they did to prevent the sickness from spreading) - The passage doesn't focus on prevention.
* **C: Hkrang madung hpe hkan nang hkan sa ai lam nga n nga** (The way they monitored the people) - The passage doesn't mention monitoring.
* **D: Machyi masha a ndai laman mabyin masa** (What they believed about the sickness) - The passage doesn't discuss beliefs about the sickness.



"
Hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni sawk sagawn mayu ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Wan shagan ni mungkan ga hte galoi adawt hkra na**.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a situation where someone is struggling and seeking help.** The core of the problem is related to their ""shagan"" (situation/circumstances) and needing ""mungkan"" (help/assistance). The text explicitly states the person is seeking help (""moi shawng kaw na adawt hkat ai"").
* **Q asks about *why* the person is seeking help.**
* **Option A (""Wan shagan ni mungkan ga hte galoi adawt hkra na"") directly addresses this by stating they are seeking help because of their difficult situation.**  ""Galoi adawt hkra na"" means ""seeking help due to difficulty.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shan dat gara hku byin wa ai:** This focuses on a detail about ""shan dat"" (something that happened) but doesn't explain the *reason* for seeking help.
* **C: Shingra masa gaw hpa re ai lam:** This mentions ""shingra masa"" but doesn't relate to the core issue of needing assistance.
* **D: Mungkan ga gara hku byin wa ai:** This simply states they are seeking help, but doesn't explain *why*.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, ni htep ai kaw buga pyada dap hku nna gara hku galaw lai wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw ni htep na matu FBI hpe shadut sai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...daru magam lu ai uhpung ni gaw FBI a madi shadaw n-gun..."" (This incident/situation involving the shooting is being investigated by the FBI.)
* **The question asks:** What are they (the people mentioned - likely authorities/witnesses) doing in relation to this incident?

Option A directly reflects the information in the passage - people are contacting/reporting to the FBI.  The other options don't align with the text.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ni htep ai hpe shanhte galaw na matu myit daw dan sai** (They are protecting the incident so they can hide it) - The passage doesn't suggest a cover-up.
* **C: Shanhte gaw mawdaw jawn ai ni hpe kaga lam de woi matsun dat sai** (They are waiting for the incident to unfold on the road) - This doesn't fit the context of an investigation.
* **D: Shanthe gaw malai lam dingyang de mawdaw htinglet shana ai lam hpe shiga jaw lai wa sai** (They are trying to understand why the incident happened in a soft way) - While understanding *why* might be part of the investigation, the passage focuses on *who* is investigating.



"
Ni htep ai ten hta shangna tingrat hpa byin wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: mawdaw htinglet shana ai lam byin wa sai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mawdaw jahten ni hpe gaw shangna tingrat ni hpe pat na matu lang ai rai nna balik 80 daram gaw kaga lam hku sa lu na matu garum ya nga ai. Mare a kaga lam rai nga ai Beltway maga de gaw mawdaw htinglet na matu aten na ai lam n nga ai hpe chye lu ai.""

This translates to: ""...the incident was reported to the police and approximately 80 vehicles were involved in the accident. More specifically, the Beltway area where the accident occurred was affected by the morning rush hour.""

Therefore, the question ""Ni htep ai ten hta shangna tingrat hpa byin wa sai rai?"" (What caused the incident?) is best answered by saying it happened during the morning rush hour – **mawdaw htinglet shana ai lam byin wa sai**.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pat da hkrum sai** (It just happened) -  While it did happen, this doesn’t explain *why* it happened.
*   **B: Kaga lam hku sa lu na matu garum ya na matu jai lang wa sai** (Because many cars were involved) - This describes a *result* of the incident, not the *cause*.
*   **C: mawdaw jawn ai ni na matu hpaw da ya sai** (It was a bad incident) - This is a subjective opinion, not a cause.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, sumla gayet sara hpe mawdaw hte n'adawt shi yang hpa byin wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Sumla gayet ai wa gaw shi a mawdaw hpe Sepulveda Boulevard ding yang hta jahkring da sai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""TMZ yu ngwi shiga dap kaw na ni gaw sumla gayet masha wa gaw Sepulveda Boulevard a aw ra hkran maga de balik ni hpe chyahkring da ai hpe chye ma ai..."" This directly translates to ""TMZ reported that the filming took place near Sepulveda Boulevard...""  It describes *where* the filming (sumla gayet) happened and how it was captured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions ""Lam kaba kaw na balik ni,"" it doesn't specifically state the filming *happened* there, only that it's related to California.
* **C:** The passage doesn't say the filming was a recreation (""pyada jahkring ai hpe sumla gayet da ai"").
* **D:** Bieber is mentioned in a quote *within* the passage, but the filming isn't directly related to him.



"
sumla gayet ai wa mawdaw hte n'adawt shi yang shi hpa galaw na maw taw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sepulveda Boulevard hta mawdaw jahkring na**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""TMZ yu ngwi shiga dap kaw na ni gaw sumla gayet masha wa gaw Sepulveda Boulevard a aw ra hkran maga de balik ni hpe sumla gayet na matu mawdaw hpe chyahkring da ai hpe chye ma ai...""  This directly translates to ""TMZ's report said the location of the accident was near Sepulveda Boulevard, and it didn't show the footage of the damage.""

Therefore, the question ""where was the damage shown?"" is answered by Sepulveda Boulevard.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pyada jahkring ai hpe sumla gayet la na** - The passage states it *wasn't* shown.
*   **C: Ningmaw lam kaba lai na** - This isn't mentioned in relation to the damage.
*   **D: Sumla matut gayet lu na matu pyada hpe ginlawn la na** - This is a misinterpretation of the passage; it doesn't say the footage was reviewed."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw gumsan magam a ana kanu kap ai hpang mabyin masa hpe tup hkrak n lu htai dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw n nga pyaw ai** (It is good/positive).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Arias gaw ana kanu nau nsawng ai baw positive byin mat ai"" which translates to ""Arias said it was a positive thing.""
* **The question asks:** What is the result of the gumsan magam (positive thing)?
* **Option A** directly reflects this positive outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi kaw yuhkraw machyi ningma nga ai** (It is generally not bad) - The passage doesn't say it's *not bad*, it says it's *positive*.
* **C: Shi gaw ting shaling re sai** (It is simply okay) - Again, the passage emphasizes a positive outcome, not just ""okay.""
* **D: Shi gaw hkum kahtet taw ai** (It is difficult) - The passage doesn't mention difficulty.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Machyi ai hte du machyi ai hta lai nna, ngai nga pyaw ai re hta n-ga nta kaw na tsun shaga ai bungli hpe galaw na ma ai.""  This translates to something like, ""Whether good or bad, they don't care about the troubles that come with being praised.""
* **The question asks:** What does the gumsan magam (Rodrigo Arias) not care about?
* **Option C** directly reflects this: ""They don't care about the troubles that come with praise."" (bungli = praise/recognition, tsun shaga ai = troubles that come with)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi gaw hkum n kahtet ai** (They are strong/powerful) - The passage doesn't focus on strength.
* **B: Bat law law shi na nta kaw hkring sa la na** (They don't care at all) - While they *are* indifferent, the passage specifies *what* they are indifferent *to*.
* **D: Shi hta ana kanu grai sawng ai machyi nga ai** (There are good things happening to them) - The passage acknowledges both good and bad, but doesn't state they specifically care about the good.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Cyclone nbung laru gaw galoi n-gun shakya wa na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Maldives de galai n du shi yang** (It will likely happen in the Maldives).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maldives ga kaw maun lap hte galaw da ai nhpye ngu ai..."" which translates to ""...it is predicted to happen near the Maldives.""
* **The question asks:** Where is the cyclone likely to happen?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** ""Nbung gaw hkying hkum mi kaw 83 kilometer de hkrat mat ai shaloi"" - This talks about the weakening of the cyclone to 83km/h, not *where* it will happen.
* **C:** ""Shi na lahta kaw galai n du shi yang"" -  This is a general statement (""It will likely happen sometime"") and doesn't specify the location.
* **D:** ""Nbung bung ai hkying hkum mi hta 149 deng galai n du shi yang"" - This talks about the wind speed (149) but doesn't relate to the location.



"
Cyclone nbung laru tsaw dik lahta kaw nbung kade ja ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hkying hkum mi hta 240 deng** (240 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""aten langai kaw 240 kilometers (149 miles per hour) daram nbung bung ai re."" This directly translates to ""the wind speed is 240 kilometers (149 miles per hour).""

The question (Q) asks for the speed of the cyclone.  Therefore, 240 kilometers per hour is the answer.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Karenia brevis na nsam ngu n sawn lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: hka kara amyu langai mi re** (which translates to ""the seawater is contaminated"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai hka kara ni hpe ma dan dan leng leng law htam wa shangun ai. Hka kara ni gaw shinggyim masha hte nga ni a maju lasa nkung hkra lu galaw ai maju lasa hpe jahten chye ai gung ni shapraw lu ai."" This means the seawater is heavily affected and contaminated with harmful algae and toxins.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shinggyim masha a lasaw lasa hpe jahten kau ya lu ai** (harmful algae spreads quickly) - While the passage mentions the algae spreads, it doesn't focus on *how* quickly.  It focuses on the *result* of that spread – contamination.
* **C: dai gaw cell langai hta grau nga ai** (this grows inside cells) - The passage says organisms *consume* cells, not that the algae grows within them.
* **D: shingra maka hku byin ai** (it's caused by red tide) -  The passage *describes* a phenomenon similar to red tide (Karenia brevis blooms), but doesn't state that's the *cause* of the contamination. It focuses on the contamination itself.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Karena brevis n lu galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nga ni a lasaw lasa hpe jahten kau ya lu ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nga ni gaw hka kaw na toxin ni hpe grai sha hkrup ai majaw chyhkring hkring tsi mat ai."" This translates to ""The fish absorb the toxins in the water and can become poisoned.""  Therefore, the fish are affected by *Karena brevis* (the algae) because they ingest the toxins produced by it.
* **""Nga ni a lasaw lasa hpe jahten kau ya lu ai""** means ""The fish ingest/eat the toxins."" This directly reflects the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kaning re mabyin masa hta raitim lawan shapraw lu ai** (Something about a relationship with the environment) - This is too general and not specific to *Karena brevis*.
* **C: hka hpe akyu lu jaw ai** (It makes the water cloudy) - The passage doesn't mention the water becoming cloudy.
* **D: Maju lasa hpe jahten ya ai gung hpe shapraw ya lu ai** (It affects things that ingest the toxins) - While true, this is a consequence of the fish ingesting the toxins, not *how* they are affected by *Karena brevis* directly.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Hurricane Felicia a majaw byin ai mabyin n rai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: akyu hkam sha ai marang htu ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Oahu a tsa tsaw shadang shadawn rai hta letma 6.34 lung wa ai lam kajawng kaja re ai hpe """"""""akyu hkamsha lam"""""""" ngu htawng madun da ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""the 6.34 inch rainfall on Oahu was called 'flooding damage' "".
* **The question asks:** What damage was caused by Hurricane Felicia?
* **Option A** directly answers this by referencing the ""flooding damage"" (akyu hkam sha ai marang htu ai lam) mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mu laru lawm ai marang htu ai lam** - While the passage mentions damage, it doesn't specifically say the damage *continues* or ""lasts"".
* **C: bai byin ai myihprap** - The passage mentions ""myihprap"" (problems), but it doesn't state they *were solved*.
* **D: lam ni hka lim ai** - This refers to issues with forecasting, not the damage itself.



"
Gara gaw Hurricane Felicia hte seng nna shut ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: laru a majaw byin ai marang gaw Oahu hpe akyu jaw ai** (The damage caused by the hurricane was that it hit Oahu).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Oahu a tsa tsaw shadang shadawn rai hta letma 6.34 lung wa ai lam kajawng kaja re ai hpe 'akyu hkamsha lam' ngu htawng madun da ma ai.""  This directly translates to ""The damage was recorded as 6.34 million dollars worth of damage to Oahu.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions Category 4 hurricanes but doesn't say *this* hurricane was about to become one. It states it *was* a Category 4.
* **C:**  While the passage mentions ""zinlawng law malawng"" (strong winds), it doesn't say this is the damage.
* **D:** The passage says the damage *includes* flooding, but doesn't say flooding *is* the damage.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shaning 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix ngut ai hpang Piquet Jr. hpe bungli shapraw kau ai.""  This directly translates to ""In the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Piquet Jr. was punished for crashing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso gaw kadaw kadan shoihpa lam kaw lawm wa sai:** The passage mentions Alonso benefiting from Piquet Jr.'s actions, but doesn't say he *caused* the crash.
* **B: Piquet Jr. gaw awng padang dip lu sai:** The passage doesn't discuss Piquet Jr.'s general performance, only the specific incident.
* **D: kadaw kadan shoihpa lam hta shimlam mawdaw lawm sai:**  This is too vague and doesn't directly address what happened to Piquet Jr. at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.



"
Mawdaw adawt ai lam galoi byin wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Alonso mawdaw jahkring hkring ngut ai hpang kalang ta byin ai** (Alonso was penalized for his actions during the safety car period).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Piquet Jr.'s testimony led to a penalty for Fernando Alonso regarding the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. This penalty stemmed from Alonso being involved in a situation during a safety car period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kaga mawdaw ni gaw sau jahpring taw shaloi** (This race was poorly managed) - While the situation was controversial, the passage focuses on the *penalty* Alonso received, not the overall management of the race.
* **C: shimlam mawdaw n pru wa shi shaloi** (The penalty was unfair) - The passage doesn’t state whether the penalty was fair or unfair, only that it happened.
* **D: Piquet sau bang na matu sa mat ai hpang** (Because Piquet was good at driving) - Piquet's driving ability is irrelevant to the reason for Alonso's penalty.  The penalty was a result of his testimony about a deliberate crash.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw sawk sagawn ai ni madung de kam wa ai hta aten kaji kajaw sha la ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: amyu baw hpan ni a lam hpe sumtang shiga jaw ai lam** (the part about what the birds eat).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the diets of different finch species (Geospiza fortes and Geospiza conirostris) in the Galapagos Islands.** It specifically mentions what types of food (cactus, seeds) they consume.
* **Question Q asks about what the birds *eat* and what differences are observed.**  Option B directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: amyu baw hpan ni a byin pru ai lam** (the part about how the birds came to be) - The passage doesn't focus on the *origin* of the birds, but their current diets.
* **C: amyu n bung ai lapran ni lawt ai lam** (the part about the report of the birds) - The passage isn't a report *about* the birds, it's describing their characteristics.
* **D: amyu baw hpan ni gaw tsang hte tsang galai shai ai lam** (the part about the birds being studied by universities) - While the passage mentions universities studying the birds, the core information is about their feeding habits.



"
Sawk sagawn ninghkrin ni hku nna lawu kaw gara hpe sumtang shiga n jaw wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Amyu baw hpan nnan gara kaw byin wa ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on research conducted by universities (Princeton and Uppsala) regarding finches (specifically *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*) in the Galapagos Islands.**  This research is about understanding how these finches evolved.  Therefore, the question asking about the research's focus naturally leads to the answer about understanding evolution (which is related to the origin/history of life - ""amyu baw hpan nnan gara kaw byin wa ai lam"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsang hte tsang galai shai ai a shadang (The place where it's hot and cold):** While the Galapagos Islands have varying climates, that's not the *focus* of the research described.
* **C: Amyu baw hpan nnan a mying (The name of the origin of life):**  The passage doesn't discuss *naming* the origin of life, but rather *studying* it.
* **D: Chyu jaw ai lam kaw lawm ai u ni (The species that are being studied):** The passage *mentions* the species, but the research is about *why* they are the way they are, not just *what* they are.

CowParade gara kaw galaw na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Europa dan sinpraw dingda shara shagu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""CowParade lamang hpe galaw ai singpraw dingdung Europe kaw na shawng nnan myu re."" This translates to ""The CowParade displays are seen throughout Europe.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Romanian mare law law hta** - The passage mentions Romania, but doesn't say the displays are *only* there.
* **B: Bucharest muklum hta** - Bucharest is mentioned as the starting point of the campaign, but the displays spread beyond that.
* **D: Europa dan na muklum mare ni law malawng kaw** - This is too vague and doesn't directly reflect the information in the passage.



"
CowParade hpe lawu kaw gaw gara kaw tup hkrak hpaw tsun dan lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Europa dan sinpraw dingda shara shagu ginhtawng hta galaw ai shingni poi re**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...CowParade lamang hpe galaw ai singpraw dingdung Europe kaw na shawng nnan myu re.""  This directly translates to ""The sculptures from CowParade are displayed in many cities across Europe.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ""kaja ai mare"" ngu myit yu sawn la lu ai mare ni kaw sha galaw ai** - This refers to a specific place (""kaja ai mare"") and isn't the overarching answer to where CowParade sculptures are displayed.
* **B: dai hpe Bucharest Muklum Gawknu kaw shalat wa sai** - This only mentions Bucharest and doesn't cover the wider distribution.
* **D: mungkan hta kaba dik ai shawa shingni poi re** - This focuses on sculptures that are ""beautiful"" or ""interesting,"" but doesn't answer *where* they are displayed.



Therefore, option **C** best summarizes the information in the passage regarding the location of the CowParade sculptures."
Gara gaw Russia hpe II-76 ni jai lang ai kaw na jahkring na matu bying hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Jahkring taw ai san jep ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Russia masha ni hku nna ndai shoihpa byin ngut ai hte II-76s nbungli lang ai lam hpe jahkring mi hkring da ma ai."" This directly translates to ""They are investigating the incident of the Russian crash and the issues with the Il-76 aircraft.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kata kaw na hpung ni:** This refers to the initial report of the crash, not the investigation.
* **B: kadaw kadan shoihpa lam langai:** This refers to damaged areas, not the investigation itself.
* **C: Soviet hpyen dap:** This refers to the aircraft's origins, not the investigation.



"
II-76 gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nbungli langai** (meaning ""transport aircraft"").

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""II-76 gaw shaning 1970 hkan na Russian hte Soviet hpyen dap lahkawng yan a madung dawshan langai re nna lai wa sai shata mi hta Russia kaw manu mana hkala nba kalang mi byin hkrum ga sai re.""  This translates to ""The II-76 was a large transport aircraft developed in the 1970s by the Russians and Soviets and used to transport Russian military equipment and personnel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hka shang sanghpaw langai** (mountain climbing aircraft) - The passage doesn't mention anything about mountain climbing.
* **B: hpri gang mawdaw** (passenger aircraft) - While it *can* carry passengers, its primary function, as described in the passage, is transport of military goods and personnel.
* **D: wanleng langai** (fighter aircraft) - The passage explicitly describes it transporting *things* (equipment & people), not engaging in combat.



"
Simpsons a matu laika ka hpung hpe kadai shap wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1989 hta shi gaw Brooks hte Simpsons hte Groening hpe galaw shapraw ai lam garum lai wa sai rai nna madun poi a alat ningshawng laika ka uhpung hpe tam shap na matu mung lit nga lai wa sai.""  This translates to ""In 1989, it was about creating the Simpsons with Brooks and Groening..."" indicating Groening was involved in creating the show.

While Brooks is mentioned, the text specifically highlights Groening *along with* Brooks in the creation process.  Simon and Ullman are mentioned in relation to earlier appearances/stages of the show, but not the initial creation.



"
"Fluke tsun ai hku rai yang, kadai gaw kaja ai myit ningmu ni hte myit n-gun jaw ai lam ni sa ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: tsi du ni** (not true).

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** describes someone who is constantly worrying and being bothered by things, even minor ones. They overthink and are deeply affected by events.  It says this person *is* prone to worry and negativity.
* **The Question (Q)** asks if Fluke (the person described) is the kind of person who easily gets bothered by things and worries.
* **""tsi du ni""** (not true) directly contradicts the description in the passage. The passage *demonstrates* that Fluke *does* easily get bothered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: num hkam kaja lam jasu alun ai ni** (things that bother them easily accumulate) - While true *because* of their worrying nature, it doesn't directly answer the question of whether they are easily bothered. It's a consequence, not the characteristic itself.
* **C: la ni** (true) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies.
* **D: num hte la hkum ding dek ni** (both things bother and don't bother them) - This is a contradictory statement and doesn't fit the consistent portrayal of a worrier in the passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nkau masha ni gaw num ni hkun na tsun shapraw ai lam hpe nsharawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Fluke**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) is *about* Fluke – it describes his actions and experiences. The question (Q) asks what the passage is mostly about. Therefore, ""Fluke"" is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: la hkum ding dek ni** - This doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
*   **B: tsi hpaji hte seng ai ra rawng ai ni** - This is *a part* of what the passage describes, but not the main subject.
*   **C: num ni a hkam kaja lam** - This is also a detail *within* the passage, but doesn't encompass the whole story.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara gintawng hkum gaw n-gun atsam nga ai masa nga dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anhte chye ai daram gaw, **Titan** hta grau n-gun atsam nga ai masa hku madun lu ai shara gaw langai sha nga ai, dai gaw Mungkan ga re.""  This translates to ""The story mentions that the mass discovered in the area of **Titan** is becoming increasingly clear, this is Mungkan.""

Therefore, the mass being discussed is found on Titan.



"
Hkanu hte nawng ni dinghkren mu lu ai ntsin lawm ai hpe gara gintawng hkum hta tam mu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anhte chye ai daram gaw, **Titan** hta grau n-gun atsam nga ai masa hku madun lu ai shara gaw langai sha nga ai...""  This directly mentions Titan as the location of the described phenomenon.

Let's break down the passage (translated to help understand):

""Dai gaw hka zawn shamu shamawt na ra ai. Dai gaw hka a sa ai ladat zawn sha asan sha mu lu ai. Nang panglai makau kaw tsap taw yang, nang gaw npu kaw nga taw ai nlu dai nrai laga rai ni hpe mu lu na re.

(Roughly translated: ""This is a beautiful place, a place where water flows. It's a place where you can find peace and tranquility. Despite your hardships, you can find hope.  The mystery that was discovered is a strange shape, found in the methane seas of **Titan**, it is Mungkan."")

The question asks where the mysterious shape was found. The text explicitly states it was found on Titan.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sawk sagawn ai masha ni hpaji jaw ai lam gaw, ndai gaw chyaloi nhkoi prat na dusat dinosaur a a-mai rai tim mung, kasi madun ai rai gaw sak kung ai u mun re ngu ai hte u hkai kasha a u mun kalung nre ngu ai hpe madun nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The meaning of the feathers is that it suggests this dinosaur was at a stage of developing flight, and it discusses whether it was able to fly or just glide.""  This directly relates to the feathers being related to flight and how they contributed to the dinosaur's ability to potentially fly, impacting its *movement* (u mun) within a *gathering* (pyenli hkawm ai lam).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dusat a u mun nsam** - This is too vague and doesn't capture the specific detail about the feather's connection to potential flight.
*   **C: U mun sinda masa hte seng ai mu tam la ai lam** -  The passage mentions sinda masa, but it's about *not* understanding it, not about how it relates to movement.
*   **D: Dinosaur law malawng kaw mun nga ai hpe shagrin masat ai lam** - The passage doesn’t mention anything about dinosaurs moving in herds or flocks.



"
Dinosaur mun hta hpa n nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: barbules**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...raitim shanhte kaw magaw magaw re ngut nna **barbules** zawn - amun ni nga ai kun - hpaji rawng ni shadu ai gaw rachis zawn amun ni gaw hpang de amun ni zawn kaba wa ai re.""  This translates to ""...feathers grew and had **barbules** - the part of the feather - the feather shaft was shadowed by the rachis and the feather was wrapped around it.""  This directly links barbules to feathers of dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: rachis:** The rachis is mentioned as the *shaft* of the feather, not what grows *on* it.
*   **C: sakkung u mun:** This refers to whether the feather is symmetrical or not, not a part of the feather itself.
*   **D: kata hta asit awat re nsam:** This doesn't relate to any specific part of a dinosaur feather discussed in the passage.



"
ZMapp hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Antibodies ni hte galaw da ai** (It works by using antibodies).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ZMapp, antibody cocktail gaw shang nna bungli dabang hta ga sadi madun da ai..."" (ZMapp, an antibody cocktail, was used to treat people...). This directly indicates that ZMapp functions *through* antibodies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention anything about *not* being able to improve conditions.
* **C:** While PALM is mentioned, the question specifically asks about *how* ZMapp works, not where it was tested.
* **D:** This is a description of a *result* of ZMapp use (improving outcomes), not *how* it functions.



"

* **The passage states:** ""PALM hkrun lam hta, hkang zing na matu Zmapp hpe bang da ai, tsun mayu ai gaw hpung tang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw dai hpe npawt nhpang hku jai lang nna dai hte kaga gawn lajang na lam masum hte shingdaw na matu jai lang ai.""  This translates to: ""In the PALM study, those who received ZMapp had a higher chance of survival, and it was observed that the results were more effective and beneficial for those who received it early.""

* **Question asks:** What does the passage say about the results of PALM?

* **Option C directly reflects this information:** ""ZMapp hpe jep chyam yu ai hkrun lam na npawt ru di hku jai lang wa sai"" means ""The results showed that receiving ZMapp early was beneficial.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  This is a vague statement about general sharing and doesn't specifically address the PALM study's results.
* **B:** Mentions ZMapp but focuses on effectiveness and improvement rather than the key finding of *early* treatment.
* **D:** Talks about mass treatments and doesn't relate to the specific context of the PALM study and ZMapp.

Sawk sagawn hpaji masha ni hku nna hkamja lam jep ai jak nnan gaw gara kaw ahkyak dik rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shang gumhpraw yawm ai mungdan ni kaw** (those with weakened immune systems).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...U.S grumhpraw pyek mi nga ai hte mai mari na laika tsi hte mai shaprawt ai cells ni hpe mai garan chye ai hkamja lam jep ai jak..."" This translates to ""...a disease that attacks cells that weaken the immune system and cannot fight...""
* **The passage continues to list conditions:** ""...sinda mawng ana hpe sut su ai mungdan ni daram n lu tsi la lu ai matsan ai mungdan hkan na machyi masha ni byin chye ai mawng ana, sinwawp ana, HIV hte hkali ana ni hpe jau jau tam mu mai wa na re ngu sawk sagawn magam galaw ai ni tsun ma ai.""  This means the disease especially affects people with weakened immune systems due to conditions like cancer, leukemia, HIV, and other illnesses.

Therefore, the question ""Sawk sagawn hpaji masha ni hku nna hkamja lam jep ai jak nnan gaw gara kaw ahkyak dik rai?"" (""Who are most susceptible to this disease?"") is best answered by those with weakened immune systems.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sut lusu ai mungdan ni (people who are recovering)** - The passage focuses on *weakened* immune systems, not recovering ones.
* **C: United States kaw (United States)** - The disease isn't limited to the United States; it simply mentions the U.S. in relation to research.
* **D: Stanford dakkasu kaw (Stanford University)** - Stanford is where the research is happening, but not who is most affected."
Tam sagawn hkingrai hpe gaw gap na matu gara lam hpe jai lang na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: dip shapraw mai ai hkamja lam jep ai jak**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on research being done at Stanford University to find a cure for diseases that the US government isn't prioritizing, specifically diseases that affect fewer people (""mai mari na laika tsi hte mai shaprawt ai cells"").**  It mentions finding treatments for things like rare cancers, HIV, and malaria.
* **The question (Q) asks what the research is *about* – its purpose.**  
* **Option C (""dip shapraw mai ai hkamja lam jep ai jak"" - research to find treatments for diseases that aren't being adequately addressed) directly reflects this purpose.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U.S gumhpraw pyek mi hpra (The US government's priorities)** - This is *why* the research is happening, not *what* the research is.
* **B: Laika tsi hte mai shaprawt ai dip jak (Diseases that aren't being adequately addressed)** - This is the *subject* of the research, but not the research itself.
* **D: kaga tam sagawn hkingrai ni (This whole discussion)** - Too broad and doesn’t specify the focus of the research.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw lobate hkraw hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: shanhte nga ai lachyum gaw shata jan ginding ga bungli galaw hta ra kadawn lam n’nga ai ngu lachyum re.**

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses a situation where someone is struggling with a difficult task (likely spiritual or moral) and feels overwhelmed. They are looking for a way to understand and overcome this struggle, and they mention a feeling of being lost and needing guidance. The passage ends with a sense of hope that understanding will come.

* **Q (the question)** asks what the *reason* is for the struggle and feeling lost.

Let's break down why option B is the best fit:

* **""shanhte nga ai lachyum gaw shata jan ginding ga bungli galaw hta ra kadawn lam n’nga ai ngu lachyum re""** translates to:  ""The reason the mind is troubled is because it's wandering on the path of suffering due to worldly desires, says the mind.""  This directly addresses the root cause of the struggle – attachment to worldly things (represented by ""ginding ga bungli galaw"") causing mental turmoil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shanhte hpe hpan ai mabyin ni gaw ndai laman byin sai:** ""The story that troubles the mind is just this teaching."" This doesn't explain *why* the mind is troubled, just that a teaching is causing it.
* **C: shanhte gaw shata jan kaji wa ai a akyu mai byin ai:** ""The mind doesn't understand what it's working towards."" While this could be *part* of the problem, it doesn't explain the core struggle described in the passage.
* **D: shata jan na ntsa lam hta shanhte law malawng hpe n mu lu ai:** ""The mind doesn't want to accept responsibility on the path of truth.""  This is a possible outcome of the struggle, but not the underlying cause.



**Therefore, option B best reflects the passage's theme of worldly desires being the source of suffering and confusion.**"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na ga shara hte seng ai gara ningmu gaw shata jan ntsa ginding ga bungli byin taw ai lam hpe madun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: shata jan gaw angwi sha kaji wa ai** (The group is going to work on it).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes a situation where a problem exists (""Hpaji rawng ni...""), and people are discussing it. It mentions efforts to understand and resolve the problem.  The final sentence suggests the issue is not yet fully resolved but is being worked on.

* **Q (the question)** asks what the group is *doing* about the problem.

* **Option A** directly addresses this – it states the group is working on the issue (""angwi sha kaji wa ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ga shara ni gaw lai wa sai shaning law law kaw na hpan wa sai** - This translates to ""this matter is likely to be finished soon,"" which isn't supported by the passage's hesitant tone.
* **C: shata jan ntsa hta ga shara kaji kajaw sha nga sai** - This means ""the group is constantly discussing this matter,"" which is true, but doesn't answer the question of what they are *doing* about it.
* **D: Ga shara ni gaw ndai laman sha ram ram hpan wa sai** - This means ""this matter is very difficult,"" which describes the problem, but doesn’t say what's being done.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the context of the passage."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hka jun ai lam n rai shi yang dai hta grau n nga na gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: sumla shabra ai lam** (the issue of damaging reputation).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the damage to the sheriff's reputation.** The text states the sheriff was accused of actions that could ""masha shagu mu hkra shabra da sai majaw myi mu sakse"" - essentially, damage their reputation.  The entire situation revolves around protecting and defending their reputation.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: matut nna myit ningmu ni (things that are not clear):** While there's some ambiguity, the core issue *is* defined - it's about reputation.
    * **C: myi mu sakse hte seng nna bawng ban ai lam (the issue of being unsuccessful and being criticized):**  Unsuccessfulness is a *result* of the reputation damage, not the primary issue.
    * **D: ga shaka laika dip shabra ai lam (the issue of damaging evidence):**  Evidence is mentioned, but the central conflict is about the sheriff's standing in the community.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates the core problem is the potential damage to the sheriff's reputation.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hka sanghpaw ni na matu hpa gaw ndai laman manghkang n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hka ge ni a htat ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What caused the person to be sent to the 15-year prison sentence?
* **The passage states:** ""Pittman gaw dai mabyin masa gaw hpang na bat aten ladaw du hkra rawt jat ai lam n-nga na re ngu hpaji jaw lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""Pittman was sent to prison because of the crime he committed."" and then ""...that crime is what caused him to be sentenced to 15 years.""
* **The passage also states:** ""htat ai lam gaw sawng dik ai..."" meaning ""the crime committed was serious"".
* **Therefore, ""Hka ge ni a htat ai lam"" (the crime he committed) is the direct cause of the sentence.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sawng dik ai lamu marang masa ni:** This simply states ""serious crime"", not *why* he was sentenced.
* **B: Hka ge shadang:** This means ""his mistake,"" which is too vague. It doesn't explain the prison sentence.
* **D: byawng taw ai hkyen:** This means ""wrongdoing,"" also too vague and doesn't connect directly to the 15-year sentence.



"
"Hka ge ai lam sha n’ga, sa hkye la ni hpa mayak byin taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: lamu marang masa ni**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Regarding this matter, what did the person do with the object?""
* **The passage states:** ""Hka ge ni ayai wa ai hta n ga **lamu marang masa nhkrak ai** a majaw sa hkye la ai...""  This translates to something like ""Regarding this matter, he/she took the object and put it...""
* Therefore, the action performed with the object was ""lamu marang masa"" (taking the object).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: karum ningtum lusha ni n nga ai lam:**  This doesn't directly relate to what was *done* with the object, it seems to be about something being shown or displayed.
* **C: karum ai lam n nga ai:** Similar to A, focuses on showing/displaying, not the initial action.
* **D: hka sanghpaw ni:** This means ""difficult matter"" and doesn't answer the question about what was *done* with the object.



"
Gara kam sham ai lam gaw Robert hku nna ngang kang ai kaw na koi gam sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Galai shai lam n nga ai Mungdan Tara rung ginjaw jahkrat masat da ai ahkyak ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shi hpa mi rai tim ndai laika hpe bai kahtap tsun ai hta Roe v. Wade gaw """"""""Lamu ga a upadi jahkrat da ai"""""""" re, galai shai lam nnga ai Mungdan Tara rung ginjaw jahkrat masat da ai ahkyak ai lam hpe ahkyak galaw da ai.""  This directly translates to ""Roe v. Wade was said to be 'a legal precedent,' and it affected the way cases were decided regarding the Mungdan Tara (likely referring to a specific legal case or situation).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bawng ban taw nga ai mabyin masa ni a arawn alai:** This is a general statement about Roberts Flatley and doesn't relate to *what* the passage says was affected.
* **C: nsoi nsa asak a hpang ai lam:** This refers to a general concern but isn't the specific impact mentioned in relation to Roe v. Wade.
* **D: laksan dinghkrai na ahkaw ahkang:** This is about the consequences of Roe v. Wade being overturned, but the question asks about the *impact* the case *had* while it was in place.



"
Roberts hku nna gara ga baw gaw bawngban na matu shinggyim arawn alai hte grai shai ai hku na hkam sha ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Roe v. Wade daw dan ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Shi hpa mi rai tim ndai laika hpe bai kahtap tsun ai hta Roe v. Wade gaw """"""""Lamu ga a upadi jahkrat da ai""""""""...""  This means Roberts is talking *about* the Roe v. Wade case.
* **The question asks:** What is Roberts talking about?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Galai shai lam n nga ai Mungdan Tara rung ginjaw jahkrat masat da ai hkrang tara ni** - This is *related* to the topic, but not the central thing Roberts is discussing *directly*. It's a consequence of Roe v. Wade.
* **C: Gawai nna laksan hku nga na ahkaw ahkang** - This is too broad and not specifically mentioned as what Roberts is focusing on.
* **D: mabyin ni a tup hkrak re ai lam** - This is irrelevant to the content of the passage.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer, as the passage explicitly identifies Roe v. Wade as the subject of discussion."
Wan shadaw lahkawng gara kaw htoi taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: lamu maga de**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lamu de madun na matu wan shadaw lahkawng hpe shana tup sharawt tawn da ai."" This directly translates to ""Lamu is the one who carries the basket of vegetables.""  Therefore, the question ""Who is carrying the basket of vegetables?"" is answered by ""lamu maga de"" (Lamu is the one).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mare hpe lai nna** - This refers to receiving something, not carrying a basket.
* **C: jet pyenli ningshawng na yaw shada da ai shara kaw** - This describes a situation involving a jet, not the basket carrier.
* **D: Myit dum shingran nampan sun na ka'ang kaw** - This describes a location and someone's appearance, not the basket carrier.



"
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, lamu dep wahpang nnan ni htingbut htingra hta galoi gaw gap na rai?","The correct answer is **D: gaw gap ai lam gaw ding ngam re**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** describes a situation where someone is likely going to be late because of something happening at 8:46 AM. It talks about needing to hurry and the possibility of being scolded.  The phrase ""gaw gap ding yang re nga ai"" (might be scolded) is central to the worry expressed.
* **The question (Q)** asks what will likely happen if someone is late and doesn't fulfill their responsibilities.
* **Option D (""gaw gap ai lam gaw ding ngam re"" - the matter of being scolded is very likely)** directly addresses the core concern established in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shani ka'ang hta (what kind of person)** - This isn't related to the passage's focus on being late and consequences.
* **B: jahpawt 8:46 hta (at 8:46)** -  This is *when* the problem starts, not the consequence.
* **C: shana tup (hurry)** - This is an *action* someone is trying to take to *avoid* the consequence, not the consequence itself.



"
Kanu marai Sanit gaw lung pu re ai lam hpe gara shiga gaw madi madun taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: kahtet masat galai shai ai lam** (the way it's built to be mostly underground).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""De a kahtet ai lai ni gaw ding yang katsi kahtet lam hpe hkang zing ya ai mungkan ga a lung pu kaba ni zawn atsawm zim sha nbyin taw ai, raitim aga kata na grai sung ai hku kaba ni hkan gaw galai shai lam nnga ai""  This translates to ""The way this is built is like a mostly underground tunnel that connects to the well, and the parts that are above ground are mostly hidden.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lung pu shang lam ni a shingdan** (The construction of the well itself) - The passage doesn't focus on *how* the well is built, but how the canal is connected *to* the well.
* **C: Ginding ga sawk sagawn ai hte seng ai jep sagawn ai lam** (The way it's surveyed and mapped) - The USGS is mentioned, but the passage doesn't describe the surveying/mapping process.
* **D: mungkan ga na lung pu sumla ni** (The sum total of the tunnel and the well) -  The passage focuses on the connection *between* them, not the total.



"
Kana marai Sanit na kahtet ai lai nsam hpe gara hku masam maram ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lung pu ni a shingdan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nhtoi ahkyeng pru ai shingna gaw shina hte shani a kahtet ai shai ai lam hpe madun ai hku na lung pu ni zawn san ai."" This translates to ""The rock layers are formed by the intersection of red and white layers and are found near the canyon.""  Therefore, the layers are related to the canyon's structure (lung pu ni - canyon).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nhtoi ahkyeng pru sumla ni** - This refers to rock layers in general, not specifically what the passage describes about the canyon.
*   **B: ga hta sung ai hku ni** - This means ""the place where it was created"", which isn't the focus of the description.
*   **D: Mungkan ga na lung,pu ni a jep sagawn ai lam** - This refers to the erosion process and isn't the direct answer to *what* the layers are.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara nrup ntsen ai gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Htim gasat ai shaloi shi gaw mawdaw hpe jai lang wa sai** (In short, it's about someone who feels lost and confused, and seeks help/guidance).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes a person feeling lost (""dingsen masum mawdaw""), seeking direction (""masha hpawng de gawt shang wa ai""), and trying to understand their situation (""bawm kapaw ai kaw na lu na ningma hpe tsi tsi lajang ngut ai""). The passage also mentions a cultural identity (""Uighur myu re"").  The overall tone is one of searching for meaning and identity.
* **Q (the question)** asks what the passage is *generally* about.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shi gaw kapaw chye ai hpe danleng ai hku kapaw kau ai** (it's about someone who is constantly seeking knowledge) - While the person *is* seeking understanding, the passage emphasizes a feeling of *lostness* more than just constant learning.
* **C: shi a amyu bawsang hpe ahkaw ahkang nga ai ni chye ai** (it's about someone's personal life) - The passage touches on identity but doesn't focus deeply on personal life details.
* **D: shi gaw hkumhkang machyi hkra ai lam n nga ai** (it's about someone who is travelling a difficult path) -  While the journey *could* be difficult, the primary focus is on the internal state of confusion and searching, not the hardship of the path itself.



Therefore, **A** best captures the core theme of the passage: a feeling of being lost and needing guidance.



"
Htim gasat ai hte seng nna gara shiga hta ahkaw ahkang nga ai ni a shagrin masat da ai lam nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: htim gasat ai hpang na myit sharawt ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) discusses the suffering of the Uighur people.** It describes their pain, hardship, and the feeling of being lost and helpless.  It mentions witnessing their suffering and identifies them as Uighur.
* **Q (the question) asks about the reason for the hardship or suffering.**
* **Option C (""the reason for suffering is due to oppression"")** directly relates to the content of P. The passage implies that the Uighur people are suffering *because* of oppression.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sahpaw manang ni yawng a htung hking labau (love and compassion toward all beings)** - While a good sentiment, it doesn't answer *why* the Uighur people are suffering.
* **B: nrup ntsen wa na amyu bawsang (faith and a strong spirit)** -  Again, doesn't explain the source of the suffering.
* **D: nrup nsen wa a ningshawng hte hpang jahtum mying (faith and building a better future)** -  Similar to A & B, doesn't address the reason for the present suffering.



"
Ellis Nampan Sun hta galaw na shingjawng poi hta gara ginsup hpung ni ginsup na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dingda Africa hte Australia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Springboks gaw Australia kaw yungngoi shapyaw ai ten, matut manoi lamang hpang jahtum shingjawng lamang hpe gaw du na bat hta Johannesburg na Ellis Ginsup pa hta galaw mat na re.""  This translates to: ""Springboks will play against Australia, and the final match of the championship will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""

Therefore, the match at Ellis Park is between Dingda Africa (Springboks) and Australia.



"
Springboks gaw shanhte a hpang na shingjawng ai lam hpe gara kaw ginsup na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Springboks gaw Australia kaw yungngoi shapyaw ai ten, matut manoi lamang hpang jahtum shingjawng lamang hpe gaw du na bat hta **Johannesburg na Ellis Ginsup pa hta galaw mat na re.**""  This directly translates to ""Springboks will play against Australia, and their next home game will be played at **Johannesburg** at Ellis Park.""

Therefore, Johannesburg is where Springboks will play their next home game.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chiao hte Sharipov gaw jet jak kanawng n-gun shapraw jak garam lajang ai kaw na shim lum nna tsan ai share kaw nga nga ai lam hpe shiga shana lai wa sai re."" This directly translates to ""Chiao and Sharipov were showing interest in the situation of the jet aircraft crash.""

* **The question asks:** What caused the interest of the powerful people?

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** Focuses on the investigation of the crash site, not the initial interest.
* **C:** Refers to Russia's general actions regarding flights, not the specific reason for the powerful people's interest.
* **D:** Talks about information being withheld, not the cause of interest.



"
"Lawu hta tsun da hte maren, ganghkau dabang na lit lamang magam a pandung shadaw gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: pyenli n leng lau hkra makawp ya ai hkringrai hpe tam na** (understanding the difficulties faced by the people).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the struggles and hardships of the people (""pyenli"").** It talks about their suffering (""lamu hpungtang laksan magam gun ai""), and the need to understand their situation (""dabang kaw nbungli n leng lau hkra makawp ya ai hkringrai"").  The passage emphasizes being aware of what people are going through.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: jet jak kanawng n-gun gram lajang ai de nyi kahtep na** (understanding those who are providing assistance) - While Chiao and Sharipov are *involved* in helping, the core message isn't about understanding the helpers, but the *helped*.
    * **C: ganghkau lam hkawm ai lam shangut na** (understanding the issues related to agriculture) - The passage doesn't specifically focus on agricultural issues. It's a broader discussion of people's hardships.
    * **D: jet pyenli hpe gau mai hkra galaw ai lam** (understanding why aid isn't reaching people) -  While the passage *hints* at problems with aid delivery (Russia's actions), the primary emphasis is on the suffering *of* the people, not the failures of the system.



Therefore, understanding the difficulties faced by the people is the most central theme of the provided text."
lawu kaw na gara gaw dai mabyin hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: spam email hte seng nna upadi ka lajang ai lam hpe dai mabyin hta jai lang wa sai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ndai gaw laika pung jai lang ai ni hpang de nra sharawng ai lam shabra ai kaw na aka spam, law law hpa sa ai e-mail hpe shingdang na matu shaning 2003 na upadi tara jahkrat masat da ai lam hpe jai lang ai gaw shawng nnan lang na mara dam hpe lu hkam la sai.""  This directly translates to ""This is because it's known as spam, and the law passed in 2003 regarding mass emails is being used, which is causing significant damage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mungkan kumpyuta hkridun galaw lajang ya ai na dap daju ai mungdaw hta dai hpe tara jun wa sai:** While the passage *mentions* computers, it doesn't say the problem *originates* from them being used.
* **B: mara dam hpe galaw lai wa sai:** The passage says damage *results* from the problem, but it doesn't state the problem *is* the damage itself.
* **D: Mungkan kumpyuta hkridun galaw lajang ya ai hpe tara jun ai lam galaw sai:** This is too general and doesn't focus on the specific issue discussed – spam emails and the legal implications.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""... tara jun na lam hpe kasu alun ya ai kampani mung rai nga ai. Ndai gaw laika pung jai lang ai ni hpang de nra sharawng ai lam shabra ai kaw na aka spam...""  This directly translates to ""...the company that was actively sending spam, and was heavily punished...""
* **The passage further states:** ""...AOL hpe n ra sharawng ai dut shabra ai..."" This means AOL was heavily punished for sending spam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions computers sending spam, it doesn't say that's *why* the spam happened.
* **C:** The passage mentions 2003 as a date related to the spam law, but doesn't say it's when the spam *happened*.
* **D:** The passage says AOL was punished *for* spam, not that they were actively involved in spamming.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Vidal gaw gara hpung a matu lai wa sai ladaw masum hta ginsup hpang wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Catalan mare ninghpum de htawt sit wa ai kaw na Vidal gaw ginsup hpung a matu ginsup poi 49 hpe ginsup lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""Vidal scored 49 goals including goals during his time with Barça.""
* **The question asks:** Where did Vidal score many goals?
* **Barça** (Barcelona) is directly mentioned as the team where Vidal scored a significant number of goals (49).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sevilla:** The passage mentions Sevilla, but only in the context of *before* he joined Barça.
* **B: Catalan:** Catalan refers to a region and language, not a team.
* **D: Mare muklum:** This doesn't appear in the text and isn't relevant.



"
Vidal gaw Barça a matu game kade ram ginsup ya sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Catalan mare ninghpum de htawt sit wa ai kaw na Vidal gaw ginsup hpung a matu ginsup poi 49 hpe ginsup lai wa sai re."" This directly translates to ""and Vidal scored a total of 49 goals for Barcelona.""

The question asks how many goals Vidal scored for Barça. Therefore, the answer is 49.



"
shingjawng lamang hta kadai gaw ninghkap ginsup uhpung rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Majoi shani hta Bolonia hte shingjawng na matu shanhte masha ni nga ai manam jarawp kaw nga nga ai."" This translates to ""He played well for both Bolonia and the youth team.""  Therefore, Bolonia is directly associated with the youth team (shingjawng).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarque** - Jarque is the name of the person, not a place connected to the youth team.
*   **C: Coverciano** - Coverciano is where the shaman (coach) trained, not where the youth team is based.
*   **D: Italy** - Italy is the country, too broad a connection.



"
Jarque gaw hpa majaw manam dap kaw nga taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shi hta shaman shakyang ai nga majaw** (He is famous because he attended a shaman course).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jarque gaw shawng numdaw shaman na wunkat hpe Italy na Coverciano kaw shaman shakyang wa ai."" This directly translates to ""Jarque attended a shaman course in Coverciano, Italy.""  This is the primary reason for his fame as stated in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shi hta ladaw-shawng hkrum zup hpawng nga majaw** (He is famous because he is good at playing football). The passage doesn't mention football.
* **C: shi hta Laban shani shingjawng poi nga majaw** (He is famous because he went to Bologna and then returned). While he went to Bologna, the passage doesn't say this *made* him famous.  It's just part of his journey.
* **D: shi gaw Bolonia hte shaman shakyang taw majaw** (He is famous because he went to Bologna and attended a shaman course). The text emphasizes the shaman course *in Italy* (Coverciano) as the source of fame, not just the combination of Bologna and the course.

Jakarta gingding hkrang jasat hpaji kasa dap gaw hpa majaw sadi jaw ai lam nshapru ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: n-nang nawn panglai hkaleng kaba hkrit hpa lam n nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tsunami nbung laru sadi njaw da ma ai, Jakarta a ginding hkrang hpaji hpung ni tsun ai gaw, tsunami nbung laru sadi lam hpe nshapraw da ai hpa majaw nga yang nnang nawn shangun na magnitude 6.5 ndu ai majaw re.""  This translates to: ""The tsunami that occurred recently, regarding the impact on the Jakarta area, the information about the tsunami that occurred recently is that a wave with a magnitude of 6.5 was recorded.""
* **Question Q asks:** ""Jakarta gingding hkrang jasat hpaji kasa dap gaw hpa majaw sadi jaw ai lam nshapru ai rai?""  This translates to: ""What information was recorded regarding the impact on the Jakarta area?""
* **Option A** directly addresses this by stating it was a wave recorded (""n-nang nawn panglai hkaleng kaba hkrit hpa lam n nga ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on the reason for the damage, not the recorded information.
* **C:** Talks about preventing damage, not what was *recorded*.
* **D:** Only mentions the magnitude, but doesn't address the overall *information* recorded about the impact.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, n-nang nawn a majaw hpa baw byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Magnitude madang 6.5**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tsunami nbung laru sadi njaw da ma ai, ... n-nang nawn shangun na magnitude 6.5 ndu ai majaw re.""  This translates to: ""The tsunami that occurred recently... was a magnitude 6.5.""

The question asks what caused the tsunami. The passage directly identifies the magnitude (6.5) as a key factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hkrit tsang taw ai buga masha ni:** (The muddy area) - While the passage mentions mud, it doesn't state this *caused* the tsunami.
* **B: n-nang nawn panglai hkaleng kaba hkrit tsang lam:** (The recent past land collapse) -  The passage doesn't mention a land collapse.
* **C: sadi jaw ai lam:** (The place where it occurred) - Knowing *where* it happened doesn't explain *why* it happened.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Jan hte kaga shagan ni yawng a bungli galaw ai lam hpe sharawt ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: htoi tu ai lam, Rossy nambat, hte gayin ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""shanhte a htoi tu ai lam, shanhte a gayin ai lam ni a gau hkang hkrum ai lu matu re ai hte laga hpa nre ai lam hpe mu lai wa sai re."" (It explains about things that happen, things that are created, and things that are damaged). It also mentions ""Rossby nambat"" as crucial to understanding these processes.
* **The question (Q) asks:** What are the key elements regarding how things move/change in January and the cold season?

Option D directly reflects the three key components discussed in the passage: things that happen (htoi tu ai lam), the Rossby wave (Rossy nambat), and things that are created/developed (gayin ai lam).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: htoi tu ai hte dat yi, la n-gun bung dat nsa lwi ai lam** - ""dat yi, la n-gun bung dat nsa lwi ai lam"" isn't a central concept.
* **B: Rossy nambat, gayin ai lam, hte hpri kap ai hpe nhti nhtang galaw ai** - While Rossby wave and things getting created are mentioned, ""hpri kap ai hpe nhti nhtang galaw ai"" (the cause of the pressure moving) isn't a primary focus of the overall explanation.
* **C: gayin ai lam hte htoi tu ai lam** - This omits the crucial role of the Rossby wave.



"
shagan na Rossby nambat hpe gara hku daw dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: hpri kap ai hpe nhti nhtang galaw ai madang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai grau kaji ai Rossby nambat, hpri kap ai hpe nhti nhtang galaw ai nkaja ai shagan."" This directly translates to ""This identified Rossby number is a characteristic of the wind that blows with the curve of the earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: htoi tu ai lam hte gayin ai lam** - While mentioned in the passage, it's the *cause* of the Rossby number, not what the Rossby number *is*.
* **B: dat yi, la n-gun bung dat nsa lwi ai madang** - This refers to where the Rossby number is found, not what it represents.
* **C: bungli galaw ai madang** - Too general.  The passage specifies *how* it relates to wind movement.



"
jep sagawn galaw ai masha na tsalam shadang kade gaw Australia gumsan magam mungdan kalang ta byin wa na matu madi shadaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsa lam shadang 29**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yu maram jep yu yang tsa lam shadang 29 gaw Australia gaw mai byin ai daram lawan nna gumsan magam mungdan byin grin ai ngu kam nga ma ai."" This translates to ""however, 29 votes in parliament supported the motion to continue recognizing the British monarch as Australia's head of state."" 

Therefore, 29 votes were in favor of Australia *remaining* a constitutional monarchy (and thus, gumsan magam mungdan byin - supporting the current system)."
"Julie Gillard tsun ai hku, Australia gaw galoi gumsan magam mungdan byin gying ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Galoi mung n re**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tsa lam shadang 31 ram gaw Australia gaw galoi mung gumsan magam mungdan nmai byin ai ngu kam nga ai shaloi laklai ai..."" This translates to ""31 of the polls showed Australia would remain a constitutional monarchy..."" which means Australia would *continue* to be a constitutional monarchy - essentially, *remain* with the Queen as head of state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: lawan dik ai hku** - This doesn't have a direct connection to Gillard's campaign or the poll results.
*   **B: Elizabeth II Hkaw Hkam Num na hkaw dung ngut ai hpang** - While the passage mentions Elizabeth II, it doesn't say Gillard's campaign was *about* supporting her.
*   **D: Federal ra lata poi ngut ai hpang** -  This is too broad. The passage details the *outcome* of the federal election in relation to the monarchy question, not the election itself being the reason for remaining a monarchy.

Gara hpung kaba gaw tara hte seng ai san jep sagawn ai lam kaw rai taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Yu hpareng na lit hte san jep sagawn komti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stearns gaw dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga komti hpung a npu kaw na re nga ai yu hpareng na lit hte sam jep sagawn na matu komti kasha a tingyang up hku shara hku nna ahkum hkangse ni hpe kanu kawa prat masing hku nna me ma shabrai ai lam hta lang nga nlang nga hpe jep jen nga ai re."" This directly identifies ""Yu hpareng na lit hte san jep sagawn komti"" as the group Stearns was involved with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga Komti** - This is *part* of the full description of the committee, but not the complete answer.
*   **B: Komen Foundation** - The passage discusses Komen Foundation's policies, but Stearns' involvement is with a different entity.
*   **C: Masing nga Kanu Kawa prat** - This is mentioned as a recipient of information, not the committee itself.



"
Cliff Stearns gaw gara komti na ningbaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga Komti**.

The passage states: ""Stearns gaw dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga komti hpung a npu kaw na re nga ai yu hpareng na lit hte sam jep sagawn na matu komti kasha a tingyang up hku shara hku nna ahkum hkangse ni hpe kanu kawa prat masing hku nna me ma shabrai ai lam hta lang nga nlang nga hpe jep jen nga ai re.""  This directly translates to Cliff Stearns being involved with the Dat n-gun rung and hpaga yumga Komti.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Swiss num hta hpa n byin mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: shi na phone hte laptop lagu la kau hkrum ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Anhte ni Swimm num wa hpe roi kau ai masha manga hpe rim tawn da sai re nna shi a phone hte lang hkawm mai ai kompyuta hpe bai lu la sai re.""  This translates to ""They stole phones and laptops from the people who came from Swimm.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi na lagu la da hkrum ai gunrai ni bai lu la ai** - This doesn't directly relate to the stolen items.
* **B: Shi hpe sat kau ai** -  The passage describes theft, not being caught.
* **C: Masha 5 a gindai masat hte seng nna jahkrit shama hkrum ai** - This is unrelated information from the passage.



"
2007 Taiwan Sustainable kumhpa hpe gara hpaga hpung lu mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Republic of China kaw na Executive Yuan a shaning 2007 Taiwan Sustainable kumhpa hpe ASUS ni lu ai kaw na shai ma wa ai."" This translates to ""ASUS was awarded by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China in the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Development Award.""

Therefore, ASUS is the organization that received the award."
ASUS Eee PC ngu ai hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: laptop**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Raitim, laptop computer lang ai ni grai law wa tim..."" which translates to ""In fact, it was recognized as a laptop computer...""  

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the Eee PC *could* connect to the internet, the passage doesn't define it as primarily a phone.
*   **C:** The passage identifies it as a *type* of computer, not just a general description.
*   **D:** The passage does not mention radio or sharing features.



"
Laika pa mat ai hte seng nna kadai kaw lit nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: la kasha langai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Laika sa dap ni kaw nna dai la kasha makoi da ai ga shaka laika 600 hta 429 gaw shaning ningnan sumla shagun laika rai nna yaw shada da ai hkap la ai ni de nlu sa sa ai hpe lu sagawn la ai majaw mani tawng ban laika hpe mungdan masha ni kaw shapraw dat ai.""

This translates to something like: ""Laika was originally very expensive, and currently, from 600 to 429 is the price range for a good Laika.  This is being sold with various accessories...""

The question asks what Laika is being sold *for*.  The passage directly gives a price range: *la kasha langai* (a price range).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Laika sa ai bungli masha ni** - This refers to the type of material used.
*   **B: Obanazaw hta nga ai masha uhpung** - This refers to where it's being sold (Obanazawa).
*   **D: shiga dap** - This doesn't relate to the price or selling point.



"
"Laika pa mat ai hte seng nna, kadai hpyi nem ga tsun dat sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: la kasha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Laika sa dap ni kaw nna dai la kasha makoi da ai ga shaka laika 600 hta 429 gaw shaning ningnan sumla shagun laika rai nna yaw shada da ai hkap la ai ni de nlu sa sa ai hpe lu sagawn la ai majaw mani tawng ban laika hpe mungdan masha ni kaw shapraw dat ai.""  This translates to something like: ""Laika, along with its group, significantly reduced the number of people suffering from hardship; specifically, from 600 to 429. This reduction in suffering is attributed to 'la kasha'.""

The question asks what helped the people, and the passage directly links improvement to ""la kasha"".



"
Del Potro gaw shi na lata lahpa ana hte seng nna galoi tsi wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shawng ningnan ginsup pang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Potro gaw ndai kalang lata hta ana tsi wa sai re raitim dai ginsup ai lam hta bai wa na matu lajang taw ai."" This translates to ""Potro couldn't win even though he was very good in the final set.""  The passage implies he *almost* won, and the 'shawng ningnan ginsup pang' (final set) is where he struggled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shawng ningnan lang n'jahkring shi shaloi:**  The passage doesn't focus on *how* he played in the final set, just that he couldn't win.
* **C: Lahkawng lang ginsup pang:** The passage doesn't emphasize overall performance but specifically the final set.
* **D: Masum lang na jahkring ngut ai hpang:**  This refers to the overall match but isn't the specific point about *why* Del Potro lost.



"
Shawng ningnan pang na mahtai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shawng ningnan pang kaw Murray sum mat ai** (The final set was won by Murray).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Murray gaw, ginsup la kasha lahkawng yan a pang shagu hta ginsup ngut ai hpang shawng ning nan ginsup ai pang hta sum mat re.""  This translates to ""Murray won the final set after winning the first and second sets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del Potro gaw shi a ningma byin ai hpang sum mat ai** (Del Potro won despite being behind) - The passage doesn't say Del Potro *won* despite being behind, it says he *lost* a close tiebreaker.
* **C: lahkawng lang na pang kaw Murray dang mat ai** (The long game was won by Murray) - While Murray won, the passage specifically refers to winning the *final set*.
* **D: lahkawng lang na pang kaw Del Potro dang mat ai** (The long game was won by Del Potro) - This is incorrect; the passage clearly states Murray won.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, machyi masha hte kahtep ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **A: ginwang du wa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ginwang du wa gaw """"""""dai ni gaw jawng lung nga ai ma ni hku nna ndai machyi masha hte hkrum hkra ai lam nga ma ai hpe chye lu ai"""""""" ngu tsun ai."" (ginwang du wa said, """"""that this case is serious and involves issues of life and death"""""").
* **The question asks:** What is being discussed regarding life and death?

Therefore, ""ginwang du wa"" is the direct answer from the text regarding the serious, life-and-death matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ma ni:** While ""ma ni"" (person) is mentioned, it doesn't directly relate to the life-and-death discussion.
* **C: Texas tara shang arawng aya lu ai ni:** This refers to where the incident happened, not the core issue.
* **D: buga masha ni:** This means ""problems,"" but doesn't specifically link to the discussion of life and death.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Texas buga masha ni hpe ginwang du gaw kaning re ga sadi n jaw wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: ladat gaw atsawm sha bungli galaw taw ai lam** (the situation where the land is being sold quickly and easily).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on land sales in Texas.** Perry states the land is being sold quickly (""mabyin kaw na pru wa ai mayak""). Ginwang further emphasizes this quick and easy sale.
* **Option A directly reflects this theme.**  ""atsawm sha bungli galaw taw ai lam"" means ""the situation where the land is being sold quickly and easily.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shawa masha a shim lam hpe makawp na matu hkyen lajang da ai lam** (the situation where difficulties are encountered in protecting the land) - The passage doesn't focus on *difficulties* in protecting the land, but rather its easy sale.
* **C: mayak ni hpe tawt lai na matu shajin da ai lam** (the situation where attention is given to properly assessing the land) - While assessing land is implied, the main point is the speed of the sale.
* **D: Dai mabyin gaw n tsang ra ai lam** (the situation where the land is becoming scarce) - Scarcity isn't the primary focus; it's the *ease* of selling.



"
UW jawng ma dingsa lahkawng gaw kaning re shatu shakra ai laika hpe hpan wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Colbert a Sumtang laika**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shani shagu madun dan ai lam hte Colbert ai sumtang laika ni a shawng e gaw, Heck hte Johnson gaw shan lahkawng 1988 hta UW kaw jawng ma naw re ai nga aten kaw na shiga ni hte shiga sumtang laika ni hpe shatu shakra ai laika dip shapraw na lam ni hpe shingran mu lai wa sai re."" 

This directly translates to: ""Regarding the story of how Colbert's campaign helped Heck and Johnson win in 1988 at UW, it was described as a story that spread the story and Colbert's campaign.""  

Therefore, the passage identifies Colbert's campaign as the thing that helped spread the story of UW's win.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Electoral College** - While Al Gore and the Electoral College are mentioned, it's in a separate example about *The Onion* and not the main topic of UW's win.
*   **C: Daily Show** - Jon Stewart and the Daily Show are mentioned alongside Colbert, but are not the focus of the initial story.
*   **D: Onion** - *The Onion* is mentioned as a source of satirical stories, but isn't the one specifically credited with spreading the story about UW.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Onion chyhpyak shiga hkawseng hta n lawm ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Website**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...shata man shi kaw masha 5,000,000 daram dai website sa yu ma ai, personal ads, hking 24 shiga shapraw ai, podcast, ngut nna Our Dumb World ngu mying nga ai hpe lu shapraw wa lu ai."" This directly refers to *The Onion* having a website with various content.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: world atlas** - The passage doesn't mention a world atlas.
* **B: sumla hkrung** - This doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
* **D: Shapraw ai laika** - While *The Onion* *creates* satirical content, the question asks what it is *on*. It’s on a website.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hpa hpe pyada makawp maga da sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Trafalgar Square**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""11:29 ram hta, ninghkap ai hpung ni gaw **Trafalgar Square** hpe lai kau nna Whitehall lam de hka kau mayan hku hkan...""  This directly indicates that the group went *to* Trafalgar Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Spring Forum:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Downing lam chyinghka lam:** While they passed *near* Downing Street, it wasn't their destination.
* **D: Grand Connaught Rooms manam dap:** They passed by this location, but didn't stop there; they continued on.



"
Galoi ten hta pyada ni gaw ninghkap ni hpe mawdaw hting let ai lam n nga na matu htawt na hku tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: hking 11:29 hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""11:29 ram hta, ninghkap ai hpung ni gaw Tralfalgar Square hpe lai kau nna Whitehall lam de hka kau mayan hku hkan nna Aldwych hte Kingsway manam jarawt ntsa hku lai mat nna...""  This directly translates to ""At 11:29, the procession began to move towards Trafalgar Square..."" 

Therefore, the procession *started* moving at 11:29.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dr. Ehud Ur gaw sawk sagawn ai lam shi a ntoi a shawng daw de naw re nga ai lam hpe sadi jaw lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""Dr. Ehud Ur is researching the reasons why he became sick and is trying to find ways to help.""
* **Option C** reflects this: ""Shi gaw dai mu chye ai ni gaw tsi lajang ai lam de rai wa na re ngu kaja ai myit ningmu masa nga ai"" -  ""He is researching why he got sick and is working to find a cure/solution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Mentions Type 1 diabetes, which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **B & D:** Discuss issues with kidneys, which are not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Dr. Ur n kam sham ai hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mu chye ai ni gaw amyu langai Type 1 jit dwi ana machyi masha ni hte matut taw ai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dr. Ehud Ur gaw sawk sagawn ai lam shi a ntoi a shawng daw de naw re nga ai lam hpe sadi jaw lai wa sai re. Laga ninghkring ni zawn, shi mung sai dwi ann hpe mai tsi ai hpe nkam ai, dai mu tam ai ni gaw hkang 1 sai dwi ann lu ai masha ni hte hpa nseng ai re.""

This translates to: ""Dr. Ehud Ur was researching the reasons why he was sick.  Eventually, he realized he couldn't cure himself, and found that it was related to an autoimmune disease (Type 1 diabetes).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: tsi lajang na lam mai byin ai** (Things that aren't understood) - While the passage mentions initial research, it ultimately leads to a diagnosis, not a state of unknowing.
*   **C: tsi lajang na lam hte seng nna kaga hpaji du ni a ningmu** (Focusing on things that can be done and improving skills) - This doesn't reflect the core of the passage, which is about *discovering* the cause of his illness.
*   **D: Jit dwi ana n kap ai yu ni dai hku sha rai taw na** (How the disease affects people) - The passage focuses on *Dr. Ur's* personal experience with finding *his* diagnosis.

"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, nblungli CG4684 hten hkrat ai lam hte seng nna tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: lamu marang masa a majaw nblungli gaw madung kaw na n lu yu ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lamu marang nkaja ai hte hpawn yu wa yak ai lam byin hkrum hkra ai majaw sawk tam ai lam hpe hkum shingdang kau ra ai.""  This translates to ""The plane crashed due to bad weather and strong winds.""
* **Question asks:** What caused the crash of flight CG4684?
* **Option A** directly answers this, stating the crash was due to bad weather (""lamu marang masa"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't say the terrain was the cause. It mentions terrain *after* the crash.
* **C:** The passage doesn't specify the plane was damaged during landing.
* **D:** While the passage mentions strong winds, it doesn't say they were the *sole* cause, just part of the bad weather conditions.



"
Nblungli CG4684 yu na matu dawm kau ai gaw hpa majaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: yu na matu shara gaw du na yak ai** (the aircraft encountered bad weather).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shi yu ra aten hta minit shi jau nna lahkawng lang ngu na yu wa na matu shakut nga ai shaloi mat mat ai re.""  This translates to ""It encountered bad weather shortly after takeoff, causing shaking.""  This directly relates to encountering bad weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: CG4684 na shawng de kaga nblungli ni grai nga taw ai** (CG4684 was diverted due to the aircraft) - The passage doesn't mention a diversion.
* **C: Kokoda de nblungli hpe hkrun lam bai jaw da ai** (Someone reported seeing the aircraft land at Kokoda) - The passage states the aircraft *was going to* Kokoda, not that it landed there.
* **D: lamu marang masa gaw n hkrak taw ai** (the rain caused damage) - While the passage mentions rain, it doesn't state it *caused* damage, only that it was heavy.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Franciszek Kowal na mahkrum madup hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw hku wawt hpe tawt lai jahten kau lu sai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** Franciszek Kowal said, ""Those who are poor in spirit are blessed, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs."" (This is a paraphrase of Matthew 5:3).  He is talking about people who are humble (""poor in spirit"").
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is the core message Franciszek Kowal is trying to convey?
* **Option A (""Shi gaw hku wawt hpe tawt lai jahten kau lu sai"" - ""He is able to see those who yearn for heaven"")** best reflects the core message. Kowal is speaking about those who are spiritually humble and desire a connection to something greater (heaven).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi gaw dik shale hkala nba n hkrum ai (""He doesn't understand true justice"")** - The passage doesn't discuss justice.
* **C: Shi pru na matu shakut ai shaloi lahkum daw kau ai (""He is able to help those who struggle in life"")** - While compassion might be implied, it's not the *central* point.
* **D: Shi hku wawt hpe jahten na matu shakut ai shaloi hkala la ai (""He is lost when trying to understand those who desire heaven"")** -  This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. He *understands* them.



"
Kahtet mungkan daw hte seng ai nbung laru a byin wa na akyu kaba hpe shadawn na matu yak ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: laru gaw ga galapran taw ai hte tsan ai** (The storm is getting stronger and moving towards land).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai nbung laru gaw ga galapran taw ai hte tsan taw ai majaw shi gaw United State dai nrai Caribbean de shang na amtu yak taw ai re."" This directly translates to ""This storm is getting stronger and moving towards land, potentially impacting the United States and the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nbung laru gaw grau ja ai laru byin wa na tak ai** (The storm is just a normal storm) - The passage describes a potentially dangerous storm.
* **B: laru a n-gun hte seng na hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni hkrak n chye ai** (The storm's path is unpredictable and can change) - While storms *can* be unpredictable, the passage focuses on its strengthening and direction.
* **D: laru gaw Miami hte tsan ai kaw re** (The storm is heading towards Miami) - While it mentions proximity to Miami (3,000 miles), it doesn’t state it's *heading* there. It's a wider threat to the US and Caribbean.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw kahtet mungkan daw hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: dai laru gaw Atlantic Pang lai kaw na byin pru wa ai** (This storm formed over the Atlantic Ocean).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai nbung laru gaw Alantic pang lai a sinpraw hkran maga de byin lai wa sai re."" (This storm formed over the Atlantic Ocean).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Caribbean kaw byin na dai laru a akyu kaba hpe n chye ai** (The storm is threatening the Caribbean) - While the passage mentions the storm *could* affect the Caribbean, it doesn't state it's currently threatening it.
* **C: dai laru gaw laru kaba de gale mai ai** (This storm is not a strong storm) - The passage describes winds of 40 mph, indicating it *is* a storm.  It also mentions Danielle forming, which suggests strengthening.
* **D: Ga galapran taw ai hte tsan ai** (It's moving slowly and drifting) - The passage says it's moving at 40 mph, not slowly.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungkan zinli n byin shi yang ana ahkya hte gara tang madun da ai gaw byin na rai?","The correct answer is **A: si shangun ai lam yawm wa na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...shi ka matsing lai wa ai gaw mungkan ting kap bra ana hpe nlu shabyin shi ai shaloi ana zinli gaw **si shangun lu ai lam yawm mat ra ai** re.""  This translates to ""...if people don't follow the preventative measures properly, the disease will **spread continuously**.""

* **The question (Q) asks:**  ""...what is the reason for continuous spread and increasing illness?""

Therefore, the passage directly identifies ""continuous spread"" (si shangun ai lam yawm) as a consequence of not following preventative measures.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ana kumla ni nau n'madun na:** (people are not careful) - While lack of care *contributes* to spread, it's not the direct answer to *why* it's spreading continuously.
* **C: masha law malawng ana kap ra na:** (disease spreads quickly) - This *describes* the spread, it doesn't explain *why* it's happening.
* **D: ana kumla ni hpe ma kaji ni hkrum sha ra na:** (people don't understand) -  Understanding isn't specifically linked to the continuous spread in the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bungga laru gaw Fujian hte kade ram tsan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 9 kilometer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Morakot jak a myi gaw Miwa a Fujian ginwang kaw **kilometer sanit shi tsan ai share du lai wa ai re.**""  This translates to ""The distance from Morakot to Miwa to Fujian is **9 kilometers**.""

The question asks for the distance between Fujian and the place where the flowers bloom (bungga laru). The passage directly links the flower location to Miwa and states the distance from Miwa to Fujian is 9 kilometers. Therefore, the answer is 9 kilometers.



"
Asia de George W.Bush sa du ai shaloi kadai hkap tau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng hte Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Bush met with ""hkringmang daju Wong Kan Seng"" and ""hkringmang daju Lee Hsien Loong.""  This means he met with both of them during his visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hkringmang Daju** - Too general. He met *specific* hkringmang daju.
*   **B: Poi Shawa** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Ningtau Hkringmang Daju** - While they were hkringmang daju, the text mentions them by name, so specifying ""ningtau"" isn't the most direct answer.



"
Asia hpaga yumnga dam lada lam a matu gumsan galoi shaga wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Singapore du ai shaloi** (The place where he went is Singapore).

Here's why:

* **The passage states George W. Bush went to Singapore.** The entire paragraph describes his visit to Singapore and meetings with Singaporean leaders.
* The question asks about where the event (his diplomatic activity) took place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wong Kan Seng hte rai nga yang** (Wong Kan Seng and others) - While he *met* with Wong Kan Seng, the location is the focus of the question, not *who* he met.
* **C: Shi na midterm ra lata poi machyi sum ngut ai hpang** (He summed up what he learned from the midterm elections) - This is *why* he was traveling, but not *where* he was traveling.
* **D: Shi a Asia de bat hku kawan hkawm ai shaloi** (The place where he had diplomatic relations in Asia) -  This is too broad. The passage specifically focuses on Singapore.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw asuya a pandung shadaw rai?","The correct answer is **A: ndai shaning March shata du yang masha htaw na matu leng jahpan grau na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the purpose of the jealousy and the reason for the March event in Japan?
* **The passage states:** ""Dai ni na asuya a ndai shaning march shata hta jahpan grau jahkrat na matu lagaw sa wa na ngu tsun ai lam hpe mung ndau shana lai wa sai re.""  This directly translates to ""This jealousy and the reason for the March event in Japan are related to a situation that caused great suffering.""
* **Option A** accurately reflects this meaning: ""ndai shaning March shata du yang masha htaw na matu leng jahpan grau na"" (The March event is related to the suffering in Japan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** ""masha htaw leng yawng hpawn 300 lu la na"" (300 people suffered) - This is a detail *about* the suffering, not the *reason* for the event.
* **C:** ""bungjat 1,300 masha htaw leng lu la na"" (1,300 people suffered) - Similar to B, this is a detail, not the reason.
* **D:** ""masha htaw leng chyat ai lam hpe shanem na"" (Understand the details of the suffering) - This asks for understanding, not the purpose.



"
Asuya gaw hpa hpe ndau shabra wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: bungjat 300 masha htaw leng na matu jahpan lajang da sai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai hta nna masha htaw ai 1,300 kaw na 300 hpe bai lu la wa sai re."" This translates to ""From this, 1,300 were initially present, but 300 were removed.""
* **The question asks:** ""Asuya gaw hpa hpe ndau shabra wa sai rai?"" This translates to ""What did Asuya do?""
* **Option A** accurately reflects the passage's information – 300 were removed (from the initial 1,300).  It states ""300 were removed and then Japan was left.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  Talks about ""manghkang hkyamsa"" (something related to strength/power) which isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C:**  Mentions 1,300 being removed, which is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **D:**  Focuses on ""March shat"" (March's event) and ""hparan lu na"" (looking for something) which isn't the primary action described regarding Asuya.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, gara shiga gaw chye ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Jahkrit shama ai lam n'nga sai.**

Here's why:

* **P's statement** essentially says that things that *seem* good or desirable (gasat gala lam) often lead to suffering (du wa na re ngu myit mada taw na hpe hpaji). It emphasizes that chasing after these things doesn't bring lasting happiness.  It further states that understanding this truth is important.

* **Q's question** asks what the core message/lesson is.

* **Option B (""Jahkrit shama ai lam n'nga sai"" - Things that seem good are not good)** directly reflects the core idea of P:  things that appear desirable (jahkrit shama) are ultimately not truly beneficial (n'nga sai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jahkrit shama ai lam shayawm kau sai (Things that seem good are important)** - This is the *opposite* of the message.
* **C: htim gasat na lam hpe myit mada da ai (It explains the reasons for chasing after desirable things)** - The text doesn't explain *why* people chase after them, it warns *against* it.
* **D: htim gasat ai lam grai sawng wa na re hpe shagrin da sai (It details the suffering caused by chasing after desirable things)** - While suffering is *a result* of chasing desires, the main point is the *illusory nature of those desires themselves* – they aren’t truly good.

ninghkap ai ni hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: gumsan magam hte seng ai lit lamang gaw ninghkap ai ni na matu mahtai re.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kalang lang dawsa ai hku ninghkap ai lam gaw ra lata lamang hpe jum tek ai hta hkrat sum shangun ai a npawt re shangun ai, nkau gaw shaning 2011 du hkra na majaw re.""  This directly translates to ""The issue of the accusations was related to the state funds, and it originated from 2011.""
* **Option A** (""gumsan magam hte seng ai lit lamang gaw ninghkap ai ni na matu mahtai re"" - ""the accusations relate to state funds"") directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention a specific ""lata poi"" (state council) being involved in investigating the accusations.
* **C:** While the CEP is mentioned, the passage doesn't say the accusations *originate* from the CEP.  It says Martelly accused the CEP.
* **D:** The passage doesn't say the accusations are baseless (""kalang marang gumshem ai"").  It focuses on their origin and connection to state funds.



"
Hpang jahtum CEP pru na lam kadai tang shawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndai gaw Martelly a mali ning hta manga lang na CEP rai nga ai."" This translates to ""This is because Martelly was elected by the people to the CEP.""  The question asks who was elected to lead the CEP, and the text directly states it was Martelly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ninghkap ai ni:** (This thing that was investigated) - The text mentions an investigation, but doesn't state *it* led the CEP.
* **C: gumsan magam hte seng ai uhpung:** (The commission and those involved) -  While a commission is mentioned, it's described as *supporting* the CEP, not leading it.
* **D: CEP uhpung shang masha ni shanhte hkrai tang shawn ai:** (Those people who fought for the CEP) - These people supported the CEP, but didn't necessarily lead it.



"
Ginsup ninghkrin ni hpe Nassar shoi maroi roi rip ai hpang USA Gymnastic hku na madi shadaw n'galaw ya ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: masat shagrau ai hpe la kau ya na** (they covered up the abuse).

Here's why:

The passage states that USA Gymnastics ""madi shadaw ai re dai majaw myit ngun lu nna lawt mat ai Larry Nassar gaw aten grai na sa mat na re ngut nna ra ai ni hte galai shai ai ni hpe lu wa na re."" This directly translates to ""failed to properly deal with Larry Nassar, who was abusing athletes, and covered up the abuse.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: galaw ahkang jaw ai grup yin masa hpe hpan da ya na** (they provided support to the victim groups) - The passage doesn't state this. It focuses on the cover-up.
* **C: hpung kaba kata hta galai shai ra ai lam ni** (the details of what happened at the training camps) - The passage talks *about* the abuse, but doesn't detail specifics of the training camps.
* **D: Wanglu wanglang sawk sagawn lu na** (they conducted an internal investigation) - While investigations likely happened, the passage emphasizes the *cover-up* rather than thorough investigations.



"
"Laika hta tsun ai hku, USA Gymnastic hte United State Olympic Komiti a matut nna galaw wa na madung pandung gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Larry Nassar roi rip ai hta ninghtoi htoi na**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically details the scandal involving Larry Nassar, a doctor who abused gymnasts, and the failures of USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee (USOC) to protect athletes. The passage states the USOC was criticized for ""myit hkrum ga ai rai nna shanhte na ginsup hpan hpe anhte a uhpung kata hta masat shagrau lakmat ni hpe la kau ai nre sha shawng de sa wa nna lachyum rawng ai galai shai lam ni hte galaw dat yang gaw grau hkrak wa na re"" - essentially, for failing to adequately address the abuse and protect athletes.  The passage then *directly* connects this to Larry Nassar's abuse (""USA Gymnastic gaw madun da ai ni hpe kade roi rip ai hpe lu hpaw dan na matu jek ai lam hpe madi shadaw ai re dai majaw myit ngun lu nna lawt mat ai Larry Nassar gaw aten grai na sa mat na re ngut nna ra ai ni hte galai shai ai ni hpe lu wa na re."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: masat shagrau ai hpe la kau ya na** - While the passage mentions covering up issues, it's a *result* of the larger failure, not the primary issue described in relation to USA Gymnastics and the USOC.
* **C: dinghkrai sawk sagawn hpe galaw shakut na** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: ginsup ninghkrin ni a matu shim lam nga ai grup yin masa hpe sharawt na** - While there's mention of groups involved, the core issue is the handling of the abuse scandal.



"
Dai mabyin byin ai shaloi sanghpaw gaw gara de sa taw ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ngu ai sanghpaw shi mali gaw **Palawan na Puerto Princesa de yawng wa sai re**.""  This directly translates to ""The Avenger class mine countermeasures vessel is located near Puerto Princesa in **Palawan**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: United States** - Too broad; the vessel is *in* the US sphere of influence, but not *at* the US itself.
*   **B: Puerto Rico** - Puerto Princesa is in Palawan, not Puerto Rico.
*   **D: Japan** - The text mentions Japan as the location of a fleet, but the ship itself is near Palawan.



"
Laika hta tsun da ai dai sanghpaw hte seng nna gara gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanghpaw gaw Puerto Princesa de sa taw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ngu ai sanghpaw shi mali gaw Palawan na Puerto Princesa de yawng wa sai re."" This directly translates to ""The Avenger class mine countermeasures vessel is stationed in Puerto Princesa, Palawan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sanghpaw gaw Palawan kaw dap jung ai** - While it's *in* Palawan, the passage states it's *stationed in* Puerto Princesa, not generally ""docked"" in Palawan.
*   **C: Sanghpaw gaw bawm ninghkap masing ai baw re** - The passage doesn't mention anything about being damaged.
*   **D: Sanghpaw gaw U.S Hka hpyen dap ai sanit lang na Fleet na matu lit jaw da ai** -  The passage says it *belongs* to the U.S. Fleet, but doesn't state it was *seen* with them.



"
US hpung hte seng nna kadai gaw shana ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Laban shani, the United State a mungdan ningbaw Donald Trump..."" (Laban Shani, the representative of the United States, Donald Trump...).  It then goes on to describe actions taken *by* Donald Trump. The question asks who is the US hpung (leader/head).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tayyip Erdoğan:** He is the leader of Turkey, not the US.
* **C: ISIS gasat uhpung:** ISIS is a militant group, not a national leader.
* **D: htangdip amu madu:** This translates to ""various countries"" and is too general.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bawng masha ning hkap ai ni hpe sin na matu lit nga ai lam gara mung gaw myit la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Syria**.

Here's why:

The passage states the US is withdrawing from Syria, and the discussion revolves around the implications of that withdrawal *in Syria*. The question asks where the conflict/situation is happening, and the passage clearly points to Syria.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Europa:** While the passage mentions European concerns, the *conflict* itself isn't happening in Europe.
*   **C: United States:** The US is *leaving* Syria, not where the conflict is centered.
*   **D: U Magwi:** This option is irrelevant to the passage.



"
Pyenli hkrat ai lam gaw hpa majaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Laja lana re ai lamu ga** (the thing that makes it feel good/pleasant).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a feeling of relief and happiness.** It talks about how good it feels to be free from worry (comparing it to being released from prison) and how enjoyable life becomes.
* **""Laja lana re ai lamu""** directly translates to ""the thing that feels good/pleasant"" and captures this core feeling described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hpyen wa gap hpang ai majaw (the thing that causes trouble/problems):** The passage is about *escaping* trouble, not the trouble itself.
* **C: bumring bumrang law ai lamu ga (the thing that goes back and forth):** This doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
* **D: lamu marang n’kaja na (the thing that is not known):** The passage is explicitly describing a *known* feeling of relief and happiness.



"
Kaning re lamu ga kaw pyenli hkrat mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: laja lana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nkaja ai lamu marang hte **laja lana re ai lamu** ga rau hkrum katut lai wa sai."" This directly translates to ""...and the lamu that is **happening frequently** is causing problems.""  The question asks what is happening frequently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hpyen ni kaw** (Regarding the situation) - The passage talks *about* the situation, but doesn't say the situation itself is happening frequently.
* **C: hpawng chyawm ai lam** (The issue of being damaged) -  While damage is mentioned, it’s not the *frequency* of something happening that's the problem.
* **D: bumring bumrang law ai shara kaw** (The law that is constantly changing) - The passage mentions changing laws, but doesn't state *that* is what's happening frequently.



"
Hka lim ai lam a mahtai hte seng nna tara shang ai ni gaw hpa myit mada da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zaibru sawng yan ni bai gram lajang na**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...du ni gaw agre sha kau ai zaibru jang ni ga de shang mat ai hpe bai gram lajang na matu mai galaw na re ngu myit mada nga ai.""  This translates to ""...this is because the things that are above the zaibru that are causing problems are being covered by gram, and it is said that it is making the situation worse.""

This directly links the worsening situation (hka lim ai lam - the problem with the water) to the covering of the zaibru.  Therefore, the answer is about the zaibru.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: panglai hka kau mayan galaw da na:**  The passage doesn't focus on the overall flow of the river.
* **C: humpback chub nga myu ni hti hkum shalaw na:**  While mentioned, the humpback chub is a *result* of the problem, not the cause or a factor in *why* it's getting worse.
* **D: dusat dumyeng ginra grau shalaw na:**  The passage mentions dust, but doesn't connect it to the worsening of the water quality.



"
namhpai gaw gap ai gaw gara ni hpe tut nawng hkra machyi ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Humpback chub nga myu ni** (Humpback chub fish).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...humpback chub nga myu lawm ai kaga nga ni mung mat wa maw sai."" This directly translates to ""only the humpback chub fish are found.""  The question asks what is found in the gap, and the passage clearly identifies the humpback chub as being there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zaibru sawng yan ni** (Two types of fish) - The passage mentions *zaibru* (fish) generally, but doesn't specify two types are in the gap.
* **C: Dusat ni nga na shara** (Dirty water) - The passage mentions dirty water, but it's a *characteristic* of the area, not what's *in* the gap.
* **D: Hkumpup ni hpyan mat wa ai lam** (The place where the insects are found) - The passage mentions insects, but not specifically *in the gap*.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, United State hpe byin wa na htim gasat na lam hpe kadai ni tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Somali ladu lai myit jasat rawng ai ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Somalia na sa dik ai ni"" ngu ai sadi jaw ai lam hpe tsun shapraw da sai. (The passage mentions concerns about Somalia.)
* **The question asks:** What is the reason the United States is concerned?
* The passage directly links the US concern to the situation in Somalia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ethiopia sumtsan salang rung:** While Ethiopia is mentioned, it's in relation to the US assisting with the situation, not as the *reason* for concern.
* **C: N hpaw tsun da ai daipawt daihpang langai kaw na:** This is too vague and doesn't directly address the reason for US concern.
* **D: Kenya kaw na daipawt daihpang langai:** Similar to Ethiopia, Kenya is mentioned as a location of efforts, not the cause of the concern.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw ladu lai myit jasat rawng ai uhpung ni a htim gasat na masing hpe tup hkrak tsun lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: mung langai na hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni hta bawm kapaw na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...US hku nna ndau shana ai."" which translates to ""...the US is concerned about...""
* **It further specifies this concern is about:** ""...gumhkawng hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni"" (the situation where Ethiopia and Kenya are involved in a ""gumhkawng hkik hkam ai lamu"" - likely referring to a complex situation/dispute).
* **The question asks:** What is the US concerned about?

Therefore, the US is concerned about the situation (""gumhkawng hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni"") in the region, specifically relating to Ethiopia and Kenya. Option A accurately reflects this.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B & D: ""mung lahkawng hta bawm kapaw na""** -  ""lahkawng"" doesn't appear relevant to the US's concern as described in the passage.
* **C: ""mung lahkawng na hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni hta bawm kapaw na""** - Including ""lahkawng"" again makes this incorrect, as the passage doesn't focus on something happening *in* ""lahkawng"".



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw tara kasa n rai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Rapdaw salang hte tara kasa, Petros Mantouvalos hpe tara nshang bungli galaw ai hte kyang laban ai kaw lam ai ngu tsun ai hpe bai dawm la kau ma ai.""  This translates to ""...the state and the case, Petros Mantouvalos was brought to trial and convicted.""  This clearly indicates Petros Mantouvalos was the one convicted/sentenced.



"
Lawu kaw na gara uhpung gaw Greek tara hte seng ai masha hpung kata hta shatan nhkan n hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Tara kasa ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai mahtai hku na gaw, Greek tara lam hte seng ai uhpung kata shatan nhkan shiga ni gaw lai wa sai shaning laman hta **tara agyi ni, tara kasa ni, tara rung tara kasa ni** a tara nshang ai sat lawat ni dawng pru wa ai lam grai law wa ai.""

This translates to: ""Furthermore, the incident that sparked the unrest among the Greek public was, as it emerged from the following days, the **leader of the team, the owner of the team, the former owner of the team** and those involved in the fateful night.""

Therefore, the unrest was sparked by the **owner of the team** (tara kasa ni).



"
Kala mung gaw wicket shadung kade shamat kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: 36**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ningbaw wa a wicket shadung sum mat ai shaloi Kala gaw 36 lang sha lu nna wicket 7 sum mat ai.""  This directly translates to ""If he bowled and took wickets, Kala bowled 36 balls and took 7 wickets.""

The question asks how many balls Kala bowled when taking wickets. The passage clearly states Kala bowled **36** balls.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, madang tsaw dik ai masat gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: lagat 70**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Robin Uthappa gaw bawlung 41 hpe 11 lang hte 2 lang gayet nna **70 lu lagat** nna madang tsaw htum ai masat hpe lu galaw lai wa sai.""

This directly translates to: ""Robin Uthappa scored **70 runs** after facing 41 balls, with 11 fours and 2 sixes...""

Therefore, the madang tsaw (runs) is 70."
"Lawu kaw na gara wa gaw, Adam Cuerden a pawt sindawng byin ningpawt n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ngang hte seng nna dai ginra a ningnan hkrang tara** (Generally, due to the difficulty of understanding).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masha uhpung a masin pawt ai lam ni gaw dai ginra kaw hprang hprang re nna tara shang ai shiga dap ni wan hku hpaw tawn nna ya hkyak hkyak e galaw nga ai ngang hte seng a hkrang tara ni hpe laika hkrang hku nna galaw sa wa na matu madi madun ya nga ai.""  This translates to something like ""The reason Masha's efforts were difficult is because generally, due to the difficulty of understanding, it was hard to explain the details.""  This directly links Adam Cuerden's difficulty (implied by the question asking *why* he struggled) to the overall difficulty of the subject matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wale shingni hpaji hpe shaprai kau ya ai** (Only wanting to buy Wiki articles) - The passage mentions this but doesn't explain *why* Adam Cuerden struggled. It's a background detail.
* **C: Wale masha ni n'madat ya ai lam** (The things Masha didn't understand) - The passage is about the difficulty of *explaining* things, not Masha's lack of understanding.
* **D: Shingni hpaji hpe shaprai kau ya ai ningpawt hte seng nna masu ai lam** (The difficulty of buying Wiki articles) - Again, this refers to a specific action (buying articles) and isn’t the core reason for the struggle described in the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, dai shara kaw na hpa hpe shaprai kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Ngang hte seng ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly discusses ""ngang hte seng"" (things that are good/beneficial/positive) and how they contribute to a good life (""tara shang ai""). The question asks what is sought after or valued (""shaprai kau ai""), and the passage clearly indicates that ""ngang hte seng ai lam"" is what people strive for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shingni hpaji:** (Spirituality/Religion) While potentially present as a component, the passage doesn't focus *primarily* on this.
*   **C: Hkrang tara laika nhprang:** (Improvement of life) This is a *result* of seeking good things, not the thing being sought after itself.
*   **D: Dinghkrai-madu shiga dap:** (Knowledge and wisdom) These are helpful, but the passage emphasizes the overall *experience* of good things, not just acquiring knowledge.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpe Amir Khan madi shadaw ai lam n'nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: British shingjawng ai ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...shi tsun ai gaw shi gaw London kaw hkyen sa wa na shaning 2012 a Olympics hta British hpe ninghkap shing jawng na ni hpe karum madi shadaw sa na ngu tsun ai.""  This translates to ""...what he said was that he seriously wanted to win for Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London.""

* **The question asks:** What did Amir Khan want to do, according to the passage?

Therefore, wanting to represent and win for **Britain** is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Olampik hta htawng hkat ai lamang hta num ni lawm wa ai lam** (Wanting to win a medal at the Olympics) - While he likely *wanted* to win a medal, the passage specifically focuses on wanting to win *for Britain*.
* **C: num ni a ningmu ni** (His courage) - Courage isn't the direct focus of what he expressed.
* **D: Olampik hpe London manam madu tai ai lam** (Wanting the Olympics to be held in London) - The passage doesn't mention anything about where he wanted the Olympics to be held.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Amir Khan gaw shi ningmu hpe nyet kau nna lawu kaw na gara hpe madi shadaw na rai?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 Olampik**.

Here's why:

The passage states Amir Khan said he was ""sung sung myit yu yang num ni nmai htawng hkat shingjawng nga ai"" (very happy to represent his country) and that ""Dai gaw ngai na myit ningmu re"" (that is what he wanted).  It then goes on to say this feeling was connected to him representing Britain at the **2012 Olympics**. The passage specifically links his desire to represent his country to the 2012 Olympics and being able to compete for Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Num htawng hkat ai ninghkrin ni** (The feeling of wanting to represent the country) - While true, this is a general feeling, not the specific event he's referring to.
*   **B: 2004 Olampik na shi a shingjawng manang ni** (His performance at the 2004 Olympics) - The passage *mentions* the 2004 Olympics, but doesn't focus on his performance or feeling about it. It's a background detail.
*   **D: Kaga gumhpraw shagrau dazik lu ai ni** (Being a boxing prodigy) - This is also a background detail about Amir Khan, not the focus of the question.



"
Peter Lenz galoi si mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sai shalum ginsup ai shaloi** (because he was a promising young rider).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Shi sai shalum ginsup taw ai laman e Lenz gaw shi a lagaw leng ntsa kaw na di hkrat mat ai..."" which translates to ""Because Lenz was a promising young rider, he was sadly killed...""  This directly links his death to his potential as a rider.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shi a lagawleng kaw na hkrat ngut ai hpang** (because of how he fell) - While the passage mentions *how* he fell, it doesn't state this is *why* he died.
* **C: tsirung hta** (at the race) -  The location is mentioned, but it's not the *reason* for his death.
* **D: tsi magam gun ai hte nga taw shaloi** (and another rider) - The passage mentions Xavier Zayat, but doesn't attribute Lenz's death to him or their interaction.



"
Xavier Zayat gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: kaga shingjawng ai wa** (he is a fellow racer).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ngut na shi hte arau shingjawng ai wa Xavier Zayat hte adawt hkrup ai."" This translates to ""...and Peter Lenz was racing with another racer, Xavier Zayat.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: lam ntsa na tsi magam gun ai wa** (he is someone who doesn't give up easily) - The text doesn't directly state this about Zayat. It says this about Lenz.
*   **C: tsi du** (nothing) - This is clearly not true, as the text mentions Zayat's involvement in the race.
*   **D: shi hpe n'gun jaw ai masha langai** (he is a strong person) - The text doesn't provide information about Zayat's strength or character.



"
Myit tsang chye ai pyen ai wa gaw kaning re mabyin masa hta pyenli na kata bungli galaw ai lam chye na ai majaw akyu lu na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: lama na shanhte a pyen hkawm ai n ra ai hpe tau hkrau n chye lu ai hkrit myit a n'tsa myit maju jung yang.**

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes Masha remembering a past event, specifically a difficult time (indicated by phrases like ""hkrit ra ai mahkrum madup"" - a difficult memory) and the struggles of the Shan people (""grau nna shanhte njawn ga yang dai""). It mentions a feeling of being overwhelmed and remembering painful experiences.
* **Q's question** asks about *why* she remembers painful things from the past.  It's about the reason behind her recollections.
* **Option B** directly addresses this. It translates to something like: ""Because Masha remembers things the Shan people experienced and the hardships they faced, it's a deeply emotional and sensitive matter."" This connects to the original text's emphasis on remembering hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Focuses on *how* Masha remembers, not *why*.
* **C:** Talks about Masha being careless or thoughtless, which isn't implied in the text.
* **D:** Suggests Masha is actively seeking out painful memories, which isn't the case – she's being *reminded* of them.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Laika daw hta ninpawt nna, lawu kaw na gara wa gaw manu-hprang maja ai bu hkawm ai wa hku nna hpang jahtum galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **A: bu hkawm hpaga hpung ni law malawng na jaw na tsun ai kumhpa ni hpe tam na**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage describes a situation where a company is receiving many applications (sawk tam nna manu shing daw ai) but is struggling to process them efficiently. It mentions the difficulty of finding qualified personnel (manu grai shai hkat ma sai).  It also suggests checking the company's website for updates (shingdaw nna gumhpraw jaw ai).
* **The Question:** The question asks about the likely reason for a bottleneck or delay in the hiring process.
* **Why A is correct:** Option A (""bu hkawm hpaga hpung ni law malawng na jaw na tsun ai kumhpa ni hpe tam na"" - meaning ""the problem is likely due to the large number of applications they are receiving and not having enough staff to process them"") directly addresses the core issue described in the passage - too many applications, not enough people to handle them.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** ""Pyenli htaw sa magam hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na"" (The company's recruitment process and interviews are not good.) - While this *could* be a factor, the passage focuses on the sheer *volume* of applications, not the quality of the process.
    * **C:** ""bu hkawm hpaga hpung law law na manu hpe shingdaw yu na"" (The bottleneck is because they are quickly accepting applicants.) - This is the opposite of the problem; they are getting *too many* applicants, not being too quick to accept them.
    * **D:** ""Pyenli htaw sa magam a website hpe jep yu na"" (The company's website is not being updated.) - While the passage mentions checking the website, it doesn't suggest the website being outdated is the *cause* of the hiring issue.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni hku nna pyenli manu kaja dik ai hpe lu la na matu shawng galaw ra ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Pyenli htaw sa magam a website hpe jep yu na** (Check the company's website).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kalang lang gaw internet kungpani law ai majaw pyenli manu grai shai hkat ma sai, sawk tam mahtai ni hpe shingdaw nna nhtet shi yang dai pyenli kungpani na website kaw na hte shingdaw nna gumhpraw jaw ai.""  This directly translates to ""Therefore, it is difficult to find reliable information about employment from internet companies, so it is best to check the company's website and see what information is available.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: internet hpaga hpung law law na manu ni hpe shingdaw yu na** (Find information about people on the internet) - The passage discourages relying on general internet searches for employment info.
* **C: Pyenli htaw sa magam hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na** (Contact the company directly and ask) - While contacting the company is *good*, the passage emphasizes *first* checking the website.
* **D: bu hkawm dat kasa hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na** (Contact the department and ask) - Similar to C, this isn't the *first* step suggested in the passage.



"
Lawan sa ya ai hpe hkan nang na matu manang galoi ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Arung arai ni hpe bu hkawm sawnghpai zaw sa dat yang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Grau lawan ai hku ndai hpe shalai la lu na matu lam gaw ndai hpe jep jen ngut sai bu hkawm sawnghpai zawn sa dat na lam sha re."" This translates to: ""The reason why the lawsuit happened is because they tried to hide things and deceive using various strategies.""  This directly links the lawsuit to deceptive practices (""arung arai"") and efforts to cover them up (""bu hkawm sawnghpai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gunrai htaw pyenli hte arung arai ni hpe sa dat yang:**  While the passage mentions problems, it doesn't specifically say they *caused* the lawsuit. It's more about the *attempt to hide* those problems.
* **B: Hpaga hpung hku na tinang a pyenli ni hpe akyu nga hkra jai lang yang:** This refers to the company's internal issues, but isn't the direct cause stated for the lawsuit.
* **D: Lawan sa ya ai magam hpe hpaga hpung kaba ni jum lang yang:** This is too general.  The passage points to deception, not just internal problems, as the driving factor.

"Laika daw hta mahta nna, tinang ayan jawn na nbungli hpe lata ai shaloi, lawu kaw na gara hpe ningshawng jaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Kaba dik ai lam langai sha sa ai nbungli htaw sa magam**.

Here's why:

* **P (the context):** Describes someone who is easily deceived, especially by flattering words. They are easily led astray by those who praise them, even if those people have ulterior motives. The text highlights their susceptibility to flattery.
* **Q (the question):** Asks what happens when someone *starts* flattering you.  It's asking about the potential consequence of receiving praise.
* **B (the answer):**  ""Kaba dik ai lam langai sha sa ai nbungli"" directly translates to ""easily deceived by flattery.""  ""htaw sa magam"" means ""it will happen to you/you will experience it."" This option perfectly aligns with the described weakness in P – being easily taken in by flattery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: amat law malawng jaw ai pyen htaw sa magam:** (It will happen in a difficult and complicated situation) - While flattery *can* lead to difficult situations, it’s not the direct or primary consequence described in P.
* **C: Tinang ayan na jawn ai pyen li htaw sa magam:** (It will happen as you wish) - This is the opposite of what P describes; the person *doesn't* get what they wish for, they are manipulated.
* **D: bungjat laksan ahkaw ahkang hpe jaw ya na zawn re pyenli htaw sa magam:** (It will happen in a way that requires careful consideration of all angles) - This is irrelevant to the core issue of being deceived by flattery.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, kadai wa gaw chyahkring hkring bu hkawm amat law law hpe jaw na zawn re rai?","The correct answer is **B: alliance bung ai kaw na tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli**.

Here's why:

* **P's text** talks about a situation where someone is experiencing hardship (""nbungli hpe sha nang a tsawm""). It describes how even small kindnesses can be incredibly impactful during difficult times.  The core idea is that *support and empathy matter greatly when someone is struggling.*
* **Q's question** asks what helps someone feel better when they are sad and lonely.  
* **Option B (""alliance bung ai kaw na tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli"")** translates to ""An alliance of support can make even a small kindness significant."" This aligns perfectly with the message of P - that even small acts of kindness (tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli) within a supportive connection (alliance bung ai kaw na) are powerful.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: n bung ai alliance kaw na n bung ai pyenli:** This is a bit redundant and doesn't emphasize the *impact* of kindness.
* **C: alliance n bung ai kaw na tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli:** The wording is awkward and doesn't flow naturally.
* **D: alliance bung ai kaw na n bung ai kaga pyenli:**  ""Kaga"" implies a larger, more substantial kindness, which doesn't fit the emphasis on *small* acts in both P and Q.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and relevant answer."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, chyaru tsa ladu shalia lusha ai majaw lawu kaw na gara maju jahten mat ai rai?","The passage discusses a situation involving illegal alcohol (methanol) causing deaths. The question asks if there's a way to prevent similar tragedies.

The passage strongly implies prevention is possible. It mentions the need for stricter law enforcement (""tsa lawm lu hpa ni hpe shadawn sharam hte lu u"") and addressing the source of the problem (""tsa chyaru gaw masha shagu hpe nbung ai hku akyu jaw nga ai"").

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Na maju** (Yes, possible).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mu maju** (No, possible) - Contradicts the overall message of the passage.
* **C: namchyim maju** (Sometimes possible) - Too vague; the passage suggests proactive prevention.
* **D: Sama maju** (Always possible) -  Unrealistic; prevention requires effort and isn't guaranteed.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw gara gaw chyaru tsa a akyu hpe shayawm kau ya na byin mai rai?","The correct answer is **A: methanol lawm ai tsa hpe lu ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tara hte nhtan shai ai wenyi ni gaw kaji timung myi di ai (sh) si ai hpe shabyin chye ai methanol lawm ai hkrit tsang ra ai nsan nseng ai baw amyu myu lawm nga chye ai.""  This translates to: ""The person drank the alcohol that was mixed with extremely poisonous (it) methanol.""
* **The question asks:** What did they drink?

Therefore, the answer is the methanol-laced alcohol.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tara nshang ai hku shapru da ai wenyi ni hpe lu ai:** This refers to drinking something poured from a pot, but isn't the *what* they drank.
* **C: tsa hpe ram daw lu na:** This is too general – it just says they drank something.
* **D: masha kaga hte lu na:**  The passage mentions a mash, but doesn't say they drank it. It's related to *how* the methanol got into the alcohol.



"
Amsterdam na tsaw dik htum sutgan arung arai ni gaw gara kaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal Ginwang**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that the Canal Ginwang (Grachtengordel) is what Amsterdam is famous for. The question asks what Amsterdam is famous for, and the passage provides the answer as the Canal Ginwang.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: UNESCO Mungkan Sali Wunli hku masat da ai shara shagu kaw:** While the canals *are* on the UNESCO list, the passage states the canals themselves are the famous feature, not just being on the list.
* **C: Binnenstad kaw na yeng seng kau ai shara ni:** The Binnenstad is the inner city *where* the canals are, but it's not what Amsterdam is famous *for*.
* **D: labau manu dan ai shara ni:**  The passage mentions houseboats, but they are a result of the canals, not the primary reason for Amsterdam's fame.



"
Canal Ginwang hpe hpa majaw UNESCO Mungkan Sali Wunli Shara zawn shalat da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shi a laklai ai sutgan arung arai ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Dai ginra yawng UNESCO mungkan Sali Wunli a matu shalat maka da hkrum ai lam gaw **dai shara a laklai ai htunghking labau a manu ni gaw dai mungdan hta tsaw dik htum ai sutgan arung arai ni rai nga ai majaw mung rai nga ai.**"" 

This translates to: ""...The reason UNESCO's World Heritage Site was designated is because **this area's beautiful architecture and the unique cultural landscape that has been preserved to this day**.""

Therefore, the Canal Ring was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its architecture and cultural landscape.  Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: shi na labau hte htunghking manu a majaw** -  While beauty is mentioned, it doesn't fully encompass the reason for the designation.
*   **C: shi na Binnenstad hpe shinggrup taw ai shara a majaw** - The passage doesn't say it was designated *because* it's part of the Binnenstad (inner city).
*   **D: shi na tsaw ai sutgan arung arai manu a majaw** -  This is too general; it mentions preservation but not specifically the architecture and cultural landscape.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Phnom Krom de sa du ging ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap ningmu ginra** (meaning ""view of Tonle Sap lake"").

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai numri kaput taw ai nawku jawng hte Tonle Sap hka lawng nta kaw na mu ai gaw dai kawng lu ai hpe mau shadan ai lam re."" This translates to: ""The reason people come to this temple is to see the beautiful view of Tonle Sap lake.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Angkor Pass hte bu hkawm lu na** (Angkor Pass and ticket) - The passage mentions the Angkor Pass for entry, but doesn't state it's *why* people visit Phnom Krom.
* **C: Siem Reap hpe mu yu na** (To visit Siem Reap) - Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but the passage focuses on what attracts people to Phnom Krom itself.
* **D: nawng de li hte hkrun lam kadun sa na** (To understand the history and culture) - While Phnom Krom has historical significance, the passage specifically highlights the view as the main draw.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Phnom Krom de lu shang na matu bu hkawm ai ni hpa baw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yasovarman htingnu hpe lai kau na** (Yasovarman's reign).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndai bum pungding nawku jawng gaw tsa ban 19 htum wa maga, Yasovarman hkaw hkam wa up ai ten ladaw hta gaw gap lai wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""This ancient temple was built in the 19th century, and was repaired during the reign of Yasovarman.""

The question asks what Phnom Krom is known for. The text directly links Phnom Krom to Yasovarman's reign – it was repaired during that time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Siem Reap grup yin sa du bu hkawm na** (Being part of the Siem Reap group) - While Phnom Krom *is* near Siem Reap, the text doesn't emphasize this as a defining characteristic.
*   **C: Angkor Pass hpe lu la na** (Needing an Angkor Pass) - The text mentions the Angkor Pass in relation to *Tonle Sap*, not Phnom Krom specifically.
*   **D: Tonle Sap makau li hte hkawm sa na** (Being associated with Tonle Sap Lake) - While it has a view of Tonle Sap, it's not the primary thing it's known for according to the text.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw mungkan bu hkawm masha ni hku nna Antarctica de sa du yu na matu pat shadang mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: December hte January shata kaw bu hkawm ahkang jaw ai bungli lamang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ginhtawng ta Nov-Feb laman sha mai hkawm ai"" which translates to ""generally gather between Nov-Feb"".  It then further specifies that December and January are peak gathering times (""ginhtawng ta hta dai shara malawng shara mali shi jan hkan bungli galaw masha hking hku na nga ma ai"").
* **The question asks:** about when gatherings happen in Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bu hkawm ai hta jailang jahpan jat ai lam** - This simply says ""the reason for gathering"" and doesn't answer *when* they gather.
* **B: Ross Sea de marai langai sha sa du masam maram na matu myit lawm ai lam** - This talks about being near the Ross Sea but doesn’t specify *when* gatherings happen.
* **D: masat da ai hkrang shamu shamawt ai lam** - This talks about the surface being rough and doesn't address gathering times.



"
Bum lung ai kaw myit lawm ai mungkan bu hkawm masha langai hku nna Antartica gara shara de sa du yu na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ross panglai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ginhtawng ta Nov-Feb laman sha mai hkawm ai, ngut na **zundawn, zunlawng, Ross panglai** hkan de sa chyai na matu shadawn masat lam nga ai.""  This directly links the areas of zundawn, zunlawng, and Ross panglai to where the melting happens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kawng lam shara:** The passage mentions the 2-3km ice sheet but doesn't say melting *happens* there specifically.
* **C: Zundawn:** While mentioned, it's listed *with* Ross panglai, making Ross panglai a more complete answer.
* **D: Zunlawng:**  Same as Zundawn - mentioned with Ross panglai.



"
Prat nau ndep shi ai lamu shagan maram dap de tawn ai byin na masa yawm dik ai shara hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: mare kaba a ka'ang kaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses someone who is constantly worried and anxious (mare kaba).** It mentions their fear, sadness, and inability to find peace. The phrase ""nre ai sha shanhte gaw mare kaba ni jawng wang ni kaw shanu"" directly translates to ""those who are always worried are like a burden.""
* **Question (Q) asks about the characteristic of the person described.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aloi sha sa du mai ai shara kaw (a person who doesn't know how to be happy):** While related to the overall feeling, the passage focuses more specifically on *worry* and *anxiety* than simply a lack of happiness.
* **C: tsan gang ai shara kaw (a strong person):** The passage depicts someone who is *weakened* by their worries, not strong.
* **D: kawlik dakkasu wang kaw (a person who always complains):** While they might complain *because* they are worried, the core issue is the worry itself, not the complaining.



Therefore, **mare kaba a ka'ang kaw (a worried person)** best captures the central theme of the passage and answers the question accurately."
Prat dep sawk sagawn myihtawn gara kaw tawn da na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: madun htingnu kaw**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...madun htingnu ni, hpaji hte seng ai lam ni hku nna sha tawn da ma sai."" This translates to ""...because of difficulties, and because of problems and hardships...""  The question (Q) asks *why* things are happening. The passage directly identifies ""madun htingnu"" (difficulties) as a reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dakkasu wang kaw** - This isn't mentioned as a reason in the passage.
* **C: Hpaji ningli hte seng ai dap kaw** - While ""hpaji hte seng ai"" is mentioned, it's *alongside* ""madun htingnu"" as a cause, not the primary one asked about in the question.
* **D: Madi shadaw shara kaba kaw** - This refers to consequences or results described *after* the reasons are given, not the reasons themselves.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw simsa ai panglai hkinggau shani na matu kaja dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Tamaki gawt panglai hkin gau ni gaw Waitemata Harbour kaw re nga ai hte **Mission Bay hte Ka-ang Auckland kaw na St Heliers ni a madang tsaw ai mare shingnawm hkan re nga ma ai.**"" This translates to ""...Tamaki's coastline is by Waitemata Harbour and **St Heliers is among Mission Bay and Auckland, and it has beautiful scenery.**""

The question asks which place is mentioned as having beautiful scenery.  St Heliers is directly described as having beautiful scenery in the text.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hka hpungyawt masa shim dik ai zawn san ai gara kaw rai?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Panglai Hkingau Dingdung gaw Pasihpik Nammuk dara hta re nna dingdung maga Long Bay kaw na dingda maga **Devonport** du hkra dam lada ai.""  This translates to ""Panglai Hkingau Dingdung is facing the Pacific Ocean, and there are islands like Long Bay and **Devonport** in front of it.""

The question asks where the *hka hpungyawt masa shim dik ai zawn san ai gara* (the place where the view is beautiful and feels peaceful) is. The passage directly connects Devonport to this beautiful view.



"
"Laika hta matsun da ai shara ni hpe sa du yu yang, lawu kaw na gara gaw n’htuk ai ngu sawn la lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sari sadang kaba ai zawn galaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chyeju hte ndai shara ni hpe shanhte hte grin dan ai sari sadang, sari kaba ai lam hte hkungga la ra ai lam yawng hte myit la ya rit.""  This directly translates to ""The story and this verse were spread by the people, covering a wide area and reaching far.""  This indicates the verse *spread* or *went far*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai shara makau hkan ashit aka da ai** (The verse was written on a beautiful stone) - The passage mentions graffiti but doesn't say the verse was written on a beautiful stone.
* **C: mani hpa galaw ai** (It flowed like a jewel stream) - While there's a mention of ""mani hpa hkum galaw"" (a jewel stream flowing) it doesn't describe *what the verse did*, but rather something else in the passage.
* **D: hkrang masa hpe mahkyit ai** (It destroyed the power of the demons) - There's no mention of demons or power being destroyed in the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Lawu kaw na gara wa gaw ga apai ai hpe gawn da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: galaw da ai laika** (the moving Laika).

Here's why:

The passage (P) repeatedly mentions ""laika gaw galaw dai"" (Laika is moving) and describes things happening *while* Laika is moving. The question (Q) asks what the cause of the described situation is.  The movement of Laika is presented as the key factor.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shingra tara hte ninghtan shai ai laika** (Laika who is strong and courageous): While possibly true, the passage doesn't focus on Laika's strength or courage as the *cause* of events.
* **C: shachyaw da ai laika** (Laika who is flying): The passage mentions ""shachyaw"" (flying) but it’s a *result* of the movement, not the root cause.
* **D: shingra tara hte seng ai laika** (Laika who is strong and warm):  Similar to B, these qualities aren't presented as the driving factor in the passage.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw auxiliary ga hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: shanhte gaw shachyaw da ai hte shingra tara hku byin wa ai ga ni re**.

Here's why:

* **P's text is about the Shan people.** It discusses their actions, their struggles, and their history. It mentions they were moved (""shachyaw da ai"") and faced hardships (""lapran hta chye na hkat na"").  It also hints at their origins (""shingra tara hku byin pru wa"").
* **Q asks about the reason for the auxiliary forces being sent.** The text implies the auxiliary forces were sent *because* of the situation the Shan people were in - their displacement and hardship.
* **Option B directly addresses this:** ""The Shan people were displaced and originated from the mountains."" This aligns with the information in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Mentions ""karum ya na matu jai lang ai"" - this isn't a direct takeaway from the text.
* **C:** Talks about ""tsun shaga lam mayak"" (a path that isn't straight) and ""grau kaja hkra galaw na matu"" (things happening during movement) - these concepts are not emphasized in P.
* **D:** Focuses on the impact of hardships (""masha ni a lapran grau ai"") – while hardships are mentioned, they aren't the *reason* for the auxiliary forces' arrival.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided text."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nshung ta hta sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai rai yang bu hkawm ai ni hku na hpa hpe jep yu ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw yup gawk shara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""...sanghpaw yup gawk nga shara hpe jep yu u."" (which translates to ""Remember the names of those who died in the war."") This is the specific detail the question (Q) asks about - what should be remembered regarding the war and those who died.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng ai** - While the passage mentions this, it's describing *how* the fallen are remembered (with honor and respect) not *what* is remembered.
* **C: Gasi ga ngau ni** - This is a closing remark (""If you are willing"") and not the answer to the question.
* **D: Mare kaba hta aten jahtum na shadang** - This refers to a detail about Saint Petersburg and isn't the primary information being requested.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, ginhtawng ta hta sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai rai yang, bu hkawm ai ni hpa hpe koi yen lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...Sanghpaw kaw jawn ai bu hkawm masha ni gaw mungdan shang ahkang lakmat nlang hkawm ra na re.""  This translates to ""The amount of money accumulated with the army is being used to improve conditions on the home front.""

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""...bu hkawm ai ni hpa hpe koi yen lu na rai?"" which means ""What is the money accumulated used for?""

* **Option C** directly answers this question by referencing the improvement of conditions on the home front (""mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mare kaba hta ahkying aten** - This means ""difficult living in the countryside"" - not related to how the money is used.
* **B: hkyen hpe lai di na lam** - This means ""the issue of sending things back"" - not related to the money.
* **D: Saint Petersburg** - This is a location, not what the money is being used for.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yawng ngu na ram gaw Spanish ga hpe chye ma ai. Rai timung, Catalan ga hpe gaw tara masa kaw na tara shang tsun shaga ga hku gaw gap masat da ai majaw ndau masat law malawng hpe gaw Catalan ga hku sha madun da ai re."" This translates to: ""While other areas speak Spanish, importantly, Catalan is spoken in daily life, and many signs are in Catalan."" This directly addresses the widespread use of Catalan in daily life and signage (like in the metro and on streets).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw Spanish ga hta grau na chye na loi ai** (This is because Spanish is spoken there) - While Spanish *is* spoken, the passage focuses on Catalan's prominence.
* **B: Dai gaw mare kaba a shawng ningnan tsun shaga ai ga re** (This is because it's a unique and important language) - The passage doesn't specifically focus on the *importance* of the language, but its *usage*.
* **C: Dai gaw Barcelona hta ra sharawng ai ga re** (This is because it's spoken in Barcelona) - This is too simplistic. The passage points to Catalan being more than just *spoken* in Barcelona - it's actively *used*.



"
Barcelona Metro gaw ayan shiga shana na matu gara tsun shaga ai lam hpe jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Hpransit (French) ga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...raitim nmyit mada da ai shana ai lam hpe dai jak kaw na Spainsh, English, French, Arabic hte Japanese ga ni hte shi hkrai shana wa ai.""  This translates to ""...instructions are available in Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.""

The question asks which language the Barcelona Metro uses for instructions. The passage specifically lists French as one of those languages.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na mai kaja htap htuk ai lam gara gaw manap lusha hte zinghkam yupra na ningshawng jaw masa n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Laksan lusha jahpan**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a B&B that is beautiful and comfortable (""zinghkam yupra hte manap lu sha""). It also mentions issues with groups causing damage (""grupyin shara kaw na du hkra hte htuk ai mu hpa lusha ni"").  The passage specifically states the owner is worried about damage and things being broken (""yup ra hte jahpawt shat"").  Therefore, the owner is concerned about *laksan lusha jahpan* – things being broken/damaged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Laklai ai manu dan rai ni hte shachying tawn da ai ni:** This refers to the number of people and whether they are staying overnight, which isn't the main concern of the owner.
* **C: Shinggan shara ni atsawm sha hkang zing da ai:**  This relates to good relationships, which isn't discussed as a problem.
* **D: Lawan ai WiFi:** The passage doesn't mention WiFi at all.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw B&Bs zinghkam lapran shingjawng ai madung lamyi laman kaw na langai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Du hkra hte htuk ai manap lusha hpan law law**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...manap lusha hta gaw grupyin shara kaw na du hkra hte htuk ai mu hpa lusha ni (sh) manam madu a laksan shat mai ni lawm mai nga ai.""  This directly translates to ""Regarding the accommodation, it seems like there's a problem with groups - they are difficult to manage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ban prat rum shatsawm tawn ai:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Prat dep zinghkam yupra:** While the text mentions ""zinghkam yupra,"" it doesn't relate to the core issue of group accommodation.
* **D: Grupyin buga kaw na lusha ni:**  The passage says groups are *difficult* to manage (""du hkra hte htuk ai""), not that they are blocked (""buga kaw na"").

Therefore, option B best reflects the main point the passage makes about B&Bs and groups.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, 2022 Beijing hta lawu kaw na gara lamang hpe n'galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpawng hpaw poi lamang** (High-speed rail).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Beijing kaw gaw hpawng hpaw hte hpawng ginchyum dat lamang hpe galaw na re..."" (Beijing used high-speed and high-efficiency transportation...)
* The question asks about transportation used *during* the 2022 Beijing Olympics.
* The passage specifically mentions high-speed rail as a key method of transportation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taizicheng hkyen jawn shara lamang:** While Taizicheng is a location, the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary mode of transport.
* **C: Hpawng pat poi lamang:** (Bus) The passage doesn't focus on buses.
* **D: Kata kaw hkyen jawn lamang:** (Regular train) The passage emphasizes *high-speed* rail, not regular trains.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw 2022 Beijing hku nna lamang madu rai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ginhtawng Olympic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ndai mungdan gaw ginhtawng hte nshung ta Olympics lahkawng hpe nta madu hku hkam la ai shawng nnan mare kaba re wa na re.""  This directly translates to ""This winter and summer Olympics were held in Beijing, and it was successful.""  ""Ginhtawng Olympic"" means Winter Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kata kaw shingjawng ai hkyen jawn lamang ni:** (The problematic snow conditions) - The passage mentions snow conditions but doesn't say this *is* what the games were about.
* **C: Nshung ta Olympic:** (Summer Olympics) - The passage specifically talks about the *Winter* Olympics being held.
* **D: Hpawng pat poi lamang:** (Artificial snow) - While the passage mentions artificial snow being used, it isn't the overall purpose or what the games *were*.



"
U li mak hkalawng ana kap na tsaw dik shoihpa nga ai ni gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: U yu bungli galaw ai ni**.

Here's why:

* **Question Q asks:** ""What is the thing that comes with youth?""
* **Option A (""U yu bungli galaw ai ni"")** directly answers this, meaning ""The things that come with youth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chyu jaw dusat ni hte bungli galaw ai ni:**  While *chyu jaw dusat* (difficulties) are mentioned, they aren't *what comes with* youth, but rather things *experienced* during youth.
* **C: U hkai byek rem ai bungli masha ni:** This refers to things forgotten/lost, not things that *come with* youth.
* **D: Shawng de ana kap ga ai masha ni:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.

* **P (the passage)** discusses someone who is struggling ( ""dusat dumyeng""), feeling hopeless (""si wa mai ai""), and being overwhelmed by problems (""mak hkalawng"").  It then mentions a ""bungli"" (likely meaning a difficulty or situation) that they are trying to overcome. The passage ends by highlighting that this ""bungli"" is a source of pain.
* **Q (the question)** asks what causes the person's suffering or problem.
* **Option A** directly relates to the passage's mention of the ""hkai byek rem ai bungli"" (difficult situation) and connects it to causing their hardship (""u li ana kap ai"" - contributing to their problems).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions ""shinggyim masha"" (difficulties), it doesn't specifically state they *originate* from it. It's more about how they're *experiencing* difficulties.
* **C:**  ""U yu bungli galaw ai ni"" refers to a resolved difficult situation, which is not the cause of current problems.
* **D:**  The passage states the *result* of difficulties is feeling hopeless, not that hopelessness itself is the cause.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Panglai Hpraw-Baltic Canal gaw hpa hte matut da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic Panglai hte Baltic Panglai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Panglai Hpraw - Baltic Canal gaw hka nu hte nawng malawng kaw na lwi wa ai Onega Nawng, Ladoga Nawng hte Saint Petersburg hkan na sha re nna Arctic Nammuk dara kaw na Baltic Panglai hte matut da ai.""  This directly translates to ""Panglai Hpraw - Baltic Canal connects the rivers and lakes including Onega Lake, Ladoga Lake and Saint Petersburg and extends to the Arctic Ocean and Baltic Sea.""

Therefore, the canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, kaning re jak rai hpan gaw bu hkawm ai ni hpe gin jang hpa n byin na matu maigan pru hkawm lakmat hpe zing la da ya na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Pyenli ni**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...Masha htawt shang **jepjoi shara langai mi gaw law malaw gaw pyenli langai ngai**...""  This translates to something like ""...in Masha's words, those who are interested in helping, those who are willing to work...""  The question (Q) asks about *how* people can help, and the passage directly links helping to being ""pyenli"" (willing/ready).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shana yup wanleng ni** - This refers to needing to check ID. While mentioned, it's a *step* in the process, not the core *how* of helping.
* **C: Sanghpaw li ni** -  This refers to being willing, but the initial statement about helping *defines* that willingness as ""pyenli"".
* **D: Jarit lai wanleng ni** - This refers to needing to register, also a step, not the fundamental way to contribute.



Therefore, **Pyenli ni** best answers the question based on the information provided in the passage."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nkau jarit lai wanleng ni hta galoi hkan tara shang ID hpe jep ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Njep ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** directly states: ""...jep ai lam ni hpe wanleng ding yang lagat let sha galaw ai, wanleng langai gaw jarik langai du ai ten nang hta tara shang ID nang hte rau nga taw ra na."" This translates to something like: ""...the way to find the ID on your profile is to look for the 'jep' section, as the profile sections are arranged in order.""  It explicitly links finding the ID to the ""jep"" section.
* **The question (Q)** asks where to find the ID on the profile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wanleng kaw na yu jang** (Where the profile is located) - The passage doesn't specify *where* the profile is, only *how to find the ID within it.*
* **B: Tinang yup taw shaloi** (If you're a new user) - The passage doesn't mention new users specifically.
* **D: Hkawm taw ai wanleng hta** (In a grouped profile) - The passage doesn't mention grouped profiles.



Therefore, **Njep ai (C)** is the only option directly supported by the text."
Sigapore na kahtet shadang tsaw ai shara kaw nga ai shaloi lawu kaw na gara gaw manghkang byin na zawn re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sa'up ai** (Difficult/Complicated).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes Singapore as being located near the equator, experiencing hot weather, and having a complex (difficult) environment. The phrase ""kahtet shadang tsaw ai"" directly translates to ""difficult/complicated weather.""  The passage also mentions challenges of living there.
* **Q (the question)** asks about the *reason* Singapore's location is significant.  The passage implies it's significant *because* of the challenging climate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gat seng de n lu sa du ai** (Not easy to live/settle) - While true, the passage focuses on the *reason* it's difficult, not just *that* it's difficult.
* **C: Kahtet kahpau ai** (Hot weather) - This is a *part* of the reason, but doesn't encompass the overall complexity.
* **D: Lam dam ai** (Peaceful) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies.



Therefore, **Sa'up ai (Difficult/Complicated)** best captures the meaning of the passage in response to the question."
German shadung muk ni hpe sha na matu kadai koi yen na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kawp ja hkum ahpun ana nga ai ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...German masha law law gaw lahkyang si (almond), haze si hte **kaga kawp ja si** ni gayau da ai rai ni hpe muk kabaw ai.""  This translates to ""German shadung generally is made with almonds, hazelnuts, and **various fruits**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lusu nga mu ai kan shakrai lusha hpe grau ra ai ni** - The text mentions Austria but doesn't say the shadung is covered in Austrian sugar.
* **C: chocolate hpe n ra ai ni** - Chocolate isn't mentioned in the description of the shadung's ingredients.
* **D: Shum ai namchyim hta dwi ai namchyim hpe grau ra ai ni** - The text doesn't discuss any specific types of cream.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gayau bang rai gaw German shadung muk a du hkra hte seng ai npawt ru di rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Lahkyang si (almond)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""German masha law law gaw **lahkyang si (almond)**, haze si hte kaga kawp ja si ni gayau da ai rai ni hpe muk kabaw ai.""  This directly translates to ""German shadung (a type of pastry) is flavored with **almond**, hazelnut, and poppy seeds.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mukawk si:** The passage mentions ""muk kabaw ai"" (flavored with), not that it *is* mukawk (something).
*   **B: Haze kawp ja si:** Hazelnut is *one* flavor, but not the main focus of the question about what it's flavored *with*.
*   **C: Mahkaw si:** This isn't mentioned as a flavoring ingredient.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw manu hpa bu hkawm hkrun lam na matu madi shadaw ai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tinang bu hkawm ai shaloi hta hkrup bungli ni hpe na galaw ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hkrun lam hkawm let bungli galaw na kun ja gumhpraw hpe shayawm shakut na kun."" (roughly translates to: ""It's good to consider the problems of combined projects when planning""). This directly relates to considering the costs associated with combined projects.
* **Option A** reflects this idea - ""Tinang bu hkawm ai shaloi hta hkrup bungli ni hpe na galaw ai"" means ""considering the problems when things are combined.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This mentions ""myit htep"" (difficulties) and ""kayin kaye"" (specific terms), which aren't the main focus of the passage's question about project costs.
* **C:** ""masha ni kaw gumhpraw hpyi na"" (enough money for planning) is a potential outcome, but not the primary point being made about *considering* costs.
* **D:** This discusses unrelated concepts like ""lusha"" (loss) and ""dum nta"" (disaster).



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the text."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw jailang jahpan nlaw dik ai kaw bu hkawm ai shaloi mayak mahkak hkrum mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bu hkawm ai shaloi tsan ai kaw na bungli galaw na matu lajang da ai ni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the difficulties of implementing projects due to budget constraints and complexities.** It specifically mentions that even with good intentions (""hpang na wa hpe mahta ai re""), projects often fail (""hkrun lam hkam ni tara nshang ai gat hkan n lagu na"").  The core problem is that projects are started (""bu hkawm ai shaloi"") but don't reach completion or achieve their intended results (""tsan ai kaw na"").
* **The passage highlights the issue of projects being started without proper planning or sufficient resources (""gumhpraw jahpan budget shau dik"").**  This leads to them being abandoned mid-way (""bungli galaw na matu lajang da ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yak hkak ai hpe hkap tau la chye ai masha ni** -  This doesn't connect to the main theme of project failures.
* **B: Tup hkrak hkan sa ra ai ahkying hte seng ai shagyip shagyeng ai lam n'nga ai masha ni** - This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on project implementation.
* **D: Bu hkawm matsun laika hpe hkan nang na matu pyaw ai masha ni** - While projects *are* started, the passage emphasizes they *don't* become successful (""pyaw ai"").



Therefore, option C best reflects the central issue presented in the passage."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Marion shara hte Fairmont lapran mawdaw gau ai lam hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai kaw nam kahtawng na hkrun lam galu ni nga ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Marion shara hte Fairmont lapran na hkrun lam galu na Buffalo-Pittsburgh mawdaw lam kaba lapran gaw mawdaw gau na yak dik ai masa lam kaw nga ai..."" This directly translates to ""The reason Marion and Fairmont were affected was because of the storm that hit the Buffalo-Pittsburgh area.""  Therefore, the storm is the cause of the problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lam kaji ni gaw chyat ai** (The road was blocked) - While the passage mentions difficult travel conditions, it doesn't state the road was *blocked*.
* **C: Chyang shadang masat ni hpe hkansa na lam taw ai** (It was about the speed of the storm) - The passage mentions wind speeds, but the main focus isn't *about* the speed itself, but the *effect* of the storm.
* **D: Sumbu phone magam gaw mayak n byin gying ai** (The phone lines were down) - This is mentioned as a *result* of the storm, not the reason for the initial problems.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Buffalo-Pittsburg mawdaw lam kaba kaw bu hkawm ai mawdaw gau ai ni na matu madung myit tsang lam rai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mawdaw htinglet ai lam kaw chyat nga na** (The storm caused damage to the roads).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a significant storm impacting travel.** It mentions high winds (35-40 mph), downed power lines (""phone line...nhprang zawn re""), and generally difficult travel conditions (""kadawng ai nemrem ni, gyip ai lam kaji ni hte masen ai dingngwi ni"").
* **The question asks about the impact on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route.** The passage directly states the storm is affecting travel *on* that route (""Marion shara hte Fairmont lapran na hkrun lam galu na Buffalo-Pittsburgh mawdaw lam kaba lapran gaw..."").
* **Option A best summarizes this impact.** The storm caused damage (implied by downed lines and difficult travel) *to the roads* themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Law htam ai radio phone magam n'nga ai** (Radio phone communication was interrupted) - While the passage mentions phone lines being down, it's a *result* of the storm damage, not the primary impact on the route.
* **C: Lawan magaw ai hpe grai lawan hkra magaw ai** (Something was seen falling and breaking) - This is too vague and doesn't capture the scale of the impact described.
* **D: Jahkring hkring lam gram ai hte hkrum ai** (Something was reported and heard) - This focuses on reporting *about* the storm, not the actual physical impact on the route.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw canyouneering galaw hpang na matu ra rawng ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Wunkat loi mi ra ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...raitim nnan hpang na matu gaw hkum hkrang hkrang sa hkra (sh) wunkat loi mi gaw galaw ra na re...""  This directly translates to ""What makes canyoneering possible is that it requires physical strength (and) those who are physically fit can do it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hka hpung yawt chye ai atsam (Steep slopes):** While canyoneering *involves* steep slopes, it's not *what makes it possible*.
* **B: Tsaw dik hkrang hte seng ai masa (Strong and brave people):** Courage is helpful, but physical fitness is the primary requirement.
* **C: Gumlawt ai atsam (Difficult conditions):** Canyoning *has* difficult conditions, but those conditions don't *enable* it.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, awngdang ai canyoning tangpyaw hkrun lam na matu ra rawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Rawt jat gan ga ai ginsup hpaji atsam** (Roughly translates to: ""It's important to have proper equipment and skills"").

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the dangers of canyoning.** It states canyoning involves descending cliffs, navigating water, and facing challenges like waterfalls, rapids, and potentially dangerous terrain.  It explicitly mentions the need for skill and proper equipment (""hkum hkrang hkrang sa hkra (sh) wunkat loi mi gaw galaw ra na re"").
* **Question (Q) asks about what's important when doing canyoning.** 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shawng de hka hpung lip ai hte seng nna mahkrum madup nga ai** (To be able to climb down cliffs and enjoy the scenery) - While enjoying the scenery *is* part of it, the passage focuses on the *challenges* and *risks* first.
* **C: Canyoneering hta tara shang sakse lakmat** (Canyoneering is a sport for brave people) - Bravery is helpful, but insufficient without proper preparation.
* **D: Hka hpung yawt chye ai atsam** (It's important to be able to descend cliffs) - Descending cliffs is *one* aspect, but the passage details many other dangers beyond just that.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer as it addresses the core safety concern highlighted in the passage – the need for preparedness through equipment and skill.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, tinang a mawdaw hta camp galaw na yaw shada da ai wa na matu hpa baw gaw karum shingtau hpa rai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tinang mawdaw a ndang di lu ai lam ni hpe atsawm myit hkawn ra ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses difficulties finding suitable transportation (a car) that fits the needs and budget.** It specifically mentions struggling to find a car that is both affordable and meets their requirements (minivan, SUV, Sedan, Station Wagon).
* **Option A directly addresses this struggle:** ""Tinang mawdaw a ndang di lu ai lam ni hpe atsawm myit hkawn ra ai"" translates to ""Understanding/realizing the difficulties of not being able to find what you want within your budget.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yup galeng mai ai baw lahkum lawm ai mawdaw** - This means ""The current situation is just a temporary transportation situation."" While possibly true, it doesn't *answer* the question about the root cause of the difficulty.
* **C: Janghpang nbung jawng ginsum** - This is unrelated to the context of the passage.
* **D: Camp galaw na matu dinghkrai shara ga** - This means ""There are issues with the cost of transportation."" While also related, it's not as direct a response to the question as A, which focuses on the *difficulty of finding* the right vehicle.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, mawdaw hte camp galaw ai ni gaw radar npu hta nga na matu shara tam taw ai rai yang shanhte hpa hpe koi kau mayu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: SUV (sh) minivan zawn re ai grau kaba ai mawdaw hpe gawt ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Lama na nang dung lahkum mai jahkrat ai minivan kaba, SUV, Sedan (sh) Station Wagon ni lu ai re yang mawdaw kaw yup nna bu hkawm ai lam mai galaw nga ai.""  This means the passage is talking about choosing between minivan, SUV, Sedan, or Station Wagon for a car.
* **The question asks:** What kind of car is being considered based on the passage?
* **Option A** directly reflects this information - focusing on SUV and minivan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions ""grau galu ai mawdaw hkrun lam"" (cars that can travel far), it doesn't focus on *lata la na* (buying/selling).
* **C:** The passage doesn't discuss ""dinghkrai shara"" (specific features) or ""janghpang nbung jawng ginsum masat shachyaw na"" (complex insurance).
* **D:** This option talks about ""shanhte jai lang gawt taw ai mawdaw hte seng nna hkau chyap ai lam"" (cars driven by people who live in the mountains and are well-maintained), which is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Casablanca hpe lahkawng lang hku nna kadai gaw gap wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Spain hpaga hpung ni** (Spanish forces).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Casablanca mare gaw Morocco mungdan kaw na gat mari hkawm na matu sharawng awng hpa n nga dik htum shara ni kaw na langai re. Moi na Medina mare makau hkan Moroccan htunghking hte seng ai rai ni re nga ai htunghking di nla ni... Spain hpaga hpung ni e mying jaw da ai re."" 

This translates to: ""...Casablanca was repeatedly contested and controlled by various powers. Later, the Moroccan rulers built the city and... Spanish forces seized it.""  This clearly indicates that Spanish forces were involved in taking control of Casablanca.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Portuguese** - While the text mentions the Portuguese built a fort (Casa Branca) that was later destroyed, it doesn't say they *took* the city.
*   **C: Merenid ni** - The text mentions the Merenid rebuilt the city as Anfa, but doesn't say they ""took"" it at any point.
*   **D: Morocoo na sultan hkawhkam** - The Moroccan sultan *rebuilt* the city, but it wasn't a taking; it was a reconstruction.



"
Shingra tsin-yam tsindam hpang Casablanca na prat dep mare hpe kadai ni kabai kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Portuguese**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Portuguese gaw dai shara hpe shaning 1755 ning na nnang nawn ai hpang sha kabai tawn kau nna, dai hpe jahten kau ai hte Casa Branca ngu ai mying npu hta bai gaw gap ai."" This translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed the city in 1755 and rebuilt it, including the fortress known as Casa Branca.""

Therefore, the Portuguese significantly reshaped Casablanca.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sintra gaw maigan amyu ni lapran matsing masat hkrum ai lam hpe gara hku lu wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lord Byron na mai kaja ai maram yu ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""dai shara gaw maigan masha ni a matu mying kaba hkra lajang da ai re majaw dai hpe hkik hkam dik ai shara ngu Lord Byron matsing sumhting da ai."" This directly translates to ""and this place is beautiful and charming, and Lord Byron also wrote something about it.""  The question asks what makes Sintra special, and the passage highlights Byron's connection to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** While mentioned as nearby, it doesn't explain *why* Sintra is significant.
* **B: Maria mauhpa shadan dan ai lam:** This refers to a religious site (Fatima) and doesn't describe Sintra itself.
* **D: Myit mangoi hpa labau re:** This is too vague and doesn't provide a specific reason for Sintra's importance.



"
Armenia ni a matsing masat da n hkrum ai hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nagorno-Karabakh ginra**. 

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the conflict revolves around the Nagorno-Karabakh region (""1994 hta, Azerbaijan a Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh ginra...""). The question asks what Armenia is fighting for, and the passage clearly indicates it's over this territory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Azeris hpe ninghtan ai majan:** While there's mention of Azeris being harmed, that's a *result* of the conflict, not the *reason* Armenia is fighting.
* **C: Azerbaijan na mung masa ndang kalang manghkang:** The passage doesn't state Armenia is trying to protect Azerbaijan.
* **D: Gumsan magam mungdan nnan:**  This refers to issues with refugees and internally displaced people, a consequence of the conflict, but not the primary reason for fighting.



"
Hpa gaw Azerbaijan hte Armenia lapran kanawn mazum ai lam hpe matut nna machyi shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nagorno-Karabakh ginra**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.** The entire text describes the history of fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia *because* of this region. The question asks what caused the conflict, and Nagorno-Karabakh is the central issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Azerbaijan hta nga ai Armenian ni** (Armenians in Azerbaijan) - While Armenians *were* in Azerbaijan, this is a result of the conflict, not the cause.
* **B: 1994 majan** (1994 ceasefire) - This is a date related to a *result* of the conflict (a ceasefire), not the *cause* of it.
* **C: Mung masa ndang kalang manghkang** (Lack of peaceful dialogue) - While likely a contributing factor, the passage doesn't highlight this as the primary cause.



"
"Charlotte hta mawdaw shap yang, hpa gaw bungjat jahpu manu byin wa chye rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hkrun lam masha masum nga yang** (There are many taxis in Charlotte).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taxi mawdaw ni hpe Charlotte na nta masha ni masa lam loi mi hkan sha lang ai raitim, malawng maga gaw nlang ma ai."" This translates to: ""Riding taxis in Charlotte is easy because there are many taxis available, and it's not difficult to find them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaga shara kaw shanu nga yang** (It's not cheap) - The passage doesn't mention the price of taxis.
* **C: Mare shinggan de sa yang** (It's very crowded) - The passage doesn't mention crowding.
* **D: Jinghku manang zawn rai yang** (It's far from the city) - The passage implies taxis are readily available *in* Charlotte.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Charlotte hta ma ni hte nga yang hpa gaw n kaja ai ngu myit lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Taxi mawdaw shap jawn ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taxi mawdaw ni hpe Charlotte na nta masha ni masa lam loi mi hkan sha lang ai raitim, malawng maga gaw nlang ma ai."" This translates to: ""The taxi fare to Charlotte is expensive, especially during peak hours.""  This directly relates to the cost of getting around Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dum nta manu ni (Something about a fly):** The passage mentions ""manu shahpu"" (bird shape) in relation to buildings, but doesn't focus on flies.
* **C: Kaga shara kaw shanu nga ai ni (Something about paper being lost):** The passage briefly mentions ""laga shara"" (paper) but it's not the central theme.
* **D: Mare kaw nga pyaw na matu shakut ai lam (Something about being unable to afford something):** While there's a hint of expense mentioned, the specific issue is the *taxi fare* being high.



"
"Spain ni n du shi yang, Chile na dingdung maga hpe kadai up hkang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dingda Chile hpe Inca ni aup hkang ai re dai shaloi **Araucanians masha (Mapuche)** ni Chile kaang hte dingdung kaw nga ma ai.""  This translates to ""and while the Inca couldn't conquer Chile, the **Araucanians (Mapuche)** resisted Spanish rule and fought to defend their land.""

Therefore, the Mapuche were the group that resisted Spanish rule in Chile.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw 1810 hta n byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Napoleonic majan ni gasat gala byin taw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chile gaw 1810 hta rawt malan sai ngu ndau tim mung (Napoleonic majan lapran shaning law law hta Spain ni gaw mungdan up hkang ai bungli atsawm nlu galaw wa ai)..."" This directly translates to ""Chile started its independence movement in 1810 (because Spain was weakened by the Napoleonic Wars).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai shaloi madung asuya n'nga ai (This question is poorly worded):** This doesn't address the cause of the 1810 events.
* **B: Chile gaw Spain mungdan hpe awng padang lu la sai (Chile was successfully rebelling against Spain):** While true eventually, the passage states 1810 was the *start* of the movement, not its success.  Independence wasn't achieved until 1818.
* **D: Chile gaw rawt malan ndau shana sai (Chile just wanted independence):**  This is too broad and doesn't explain *why* the movement began in 1810.



"
Liguria ginra na tsan ai mare de masha ni gara hku lu du na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Mawdaw (sh) wanleng hte**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lam ni, wanleng ni hte hkali ni dai mare ni hte matut tawn ai rai nna mawdaw ni chyawm gaw shinggan hku nmai du nga ai."" This translates to ""This area, the sea, and the mountains together with the five towns, create a beautiful landscape.""  

The question asks what the landscape of Liguria is known for. The passage directly connects the beauty of the area to the sea (wanleng) and mountains (hkali), along with the five towns.  ""Mawdaw"" means beautiful. Therefore, ""Mawdaw (sh) wanleng hte"" (beautiful sea and) is the most accurate answer.



"
Italy ga hkum 'Cinque Terre’ gaw hpa hpe tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mare manga**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Cinque Terre gaw Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza hte Italy ginra a Liguria kaw nga ai Monterosso ni ngu ai hkinggau mayan **mare** kaji manga pawng hpawm da ai mare re.""  This directly translates to ""Cinque Terre is a collection of five **coastal** villages...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lam yan mahkrun manga** - The passage doesn't mention a focus on historical significance.
*   **C: Ninggam manga** - ""Ninggam"" means furniture, which is not relevant to Cinque Terre.
*   **D: Panglai manga** - While the passage mentions paths and trails, it doesn't define Cinque Terre *as* a trail village.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nshung ta hta gashawt na lam byin chye ai mabyin masa na matu lawu kaw na gara buk hkyep din gaw htap htuk ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hkyepdin laju lawm ai buk hkyep din ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nkau buk hkyep din ni gaw hkyepdin laju ni lawm nna kashawt ai ginra matu hte hkyepdin lahtin ni yawng a matu htap htuk manu ai laksan shakap la na hkyepdin laju ni mung nga nga ai.""  This directly translates to ""The root rot is often seen with fast-rotting roots and the speed of root rot is particularly noticeable in fast-rotting roots.""

The question asks about root rot and what causes it, and the passage explicitly links root rot to rapidly decaying roots (""hkyepdin laju"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gyip ai lagaw lahtin hte re ai buk hkyep din ni:**  While the passage mentions lagaw lahtin (leaf blight), it doesn't connect it directly to the *cause* of root rot.
*   **C: Lagaw lahtin tsaw ai buk hkyep din ni:** Same reason as A. Leaf blight is mentioned but isn’t the reason for root rot.
*   **D: 1/5 letma sung maka kumla n lawm ai buk hkyep din ni:** This refers to the size of the fungus (5mm), but not the *reason* for the root rot.

Nshung ta na hkyen pa lam ni kaw lawu kaw na gara gaw gang dun n-gun hpe grau kaja hkra n lu galaw ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: lung sha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zaibru, **lung sha jum (calcium chloride)** ni gaw gang dun n-gun grau nga na matu lam nmaw lam kaji hkan de jahkring hkring bra taw ai.""  This directly translates to ""Zaibru, **calcium chloride** is used to make the soil more fertile and helps with plant growth.""

Therefore, ""lung sha"" (calcium chloride) is the answer to the question about what helps make the soil fertile.



"
Hawaii hte Cook Island lapran lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak bung ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lahkawng yan kaw manam dap kaba ni grai nga ai** (The distance between them is quite far).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hawaii hte aten bung nna, zunlawng ni gaw kalang marang """"""""Hawaii kata kaw sha re kun"""""""" ngu nna shadu ma ai.""  This translates to ""Although they are close in name, this island is very far from Hawaii.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lahkawng yan kaw awm dawm daru magam lu ai mungdan madang n'nga ai** (The distance between them is a land that can be crossed by walking) - The passage clearly indicates a significant distance, not one easily traversed by foot.
* **C: Lahkawng yan gaw ahkying ginwang bung ai** (The distance between them is short) - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: Lahkawng yan kaw mare kaba hpa n'nga ai** (The distance between them is very close) - Again, contradicts the passage's statement about the distance.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Cook zunlawng hpe tup hkrak n lu htawn dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Rarotonga hte Aitutaki gaw madung mare kaba ni re** (Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the main islands).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Madung zunlawng ni gaw Rarotonga hte Aitutaki re."" (The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hawaii hta grau kaji ai** (It is related to Hawaii) - While the passage *mentions* Hawaii for comparison, it doesn't state this is why people know about the Cook Islands.
*   **B: Dai gaw zunlawng majaw re** (This is an island group) - This is a true statement, but not the *answer* to the question of what people know the Cook Islands for.
*   **D: Zunlawng mungdan gaw Hawaii ahkying ginwang hte maren sha re** (The island group is famous for being similar to Hawaii) - The passage mentions a saying about the Cook Islands being like Hawaii, but doesn't say that's *why* they are known.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara namkawn du dabang gaw shana yup mai ai manam dum nta lata la ahkang lahkawng nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nang hku na Sirena kaw lana mi nga shalai yang ahkang hpyi la ra na."" which translates to ""You can reach Sirena by boat and it is a good place to stay.""  It also describes camping *at* Sirena and difficulties getting a spot there. The question asks where reservations are difficult and demand is high – Sirena fits this description perfectly.

The other options are mentioned as camping locations, but the passage doesn't emphasize reservation difficulties there like it does with Sirena.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, tinang gaw hkoi mari kat pa hte n re sha gumhpraw hte jai lang mayu yang nampan sun shang ahkang lakmat hpe gara kaw lajang da mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nang hku na Sirena kaw lana mi nga shalai yang ahkang hpyi la ra na."" This translates to ""People are going to Sirena and are having trouble finding a place to stay.""  The question asks where people are having trouble finding a place to stay (nampan tsun galaw ahkang lakmat).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Puerto Jiménez:**  Puerto Jimenez is mentioned as a place where a Ranger is, and credit cards are accepted, but not as a place with lodging issues.
* **C: CafeNet El Sol:** CafeNet El Sol is a cafe and offers internet access, not lodging.
* **D: La Leona:** La Leona is listed as a camping spot, not a place with *trouble* finding lodging.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaning re hkyen jawn ai gaw n'hkap kadawng ai bum ntsa kaw galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkyen pa jawn bum lung ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shi gaw apline lai hku hkyen pa jawn let kawan hkawm ai lam shing nrai, bum lung ai lam ni hte loi bung ai zawn rai tim, dai lam ni gaw n lawm ai hku re. Bum lung ai lam hpe gaw n'hkap kadawng ai bum ntsa kaw galaw ra na rai nna...""  This translates to: ""He/She is with friends who go skiing on alpine slopes, and enjoys skiing, this is what he/she likes. The skiing he/she does is the kind that involves going up the mountain with skins...""

The question asks what the passage says the *hkyen jawn* (skier) does that involves going up the mountain. The answer is that they *bum lung ai* (ski with skins/backcountry ski).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Backcountry ski galaw ai:** While related, the passage specifically states the *hkyen jawn* does this, it's not the direct answer to *what* they are doing when going up the mountain.
*   **C: Alpine lai shingni:** The passage mentions alpine slopes, but doesn't state that the *hkyen jawn* is specifically skiing *on* them when going uphill.
*   **D: Hkyen jawn na li la ai rai hpai ai:** This doesn't relate to the question about going up the mountain.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, grau tsaw chyang shadang de du mayu ai backcountry hkyen pa jawn ai ni hpe hpa gaw lu karum na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Kaja ai masa lam**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the challenges and dangers of backcountry skiing (""bum lung ai lam""). It mentions needing to be prepared (""kaja ai masa lam"") for situations where you might get lost or encounter difficulties (""raitim kalang marang sha shingjawng lam ni hpe li ai rai nlawm ai sha hkyen pa jawn let mung dan hpe lai di lu ai chyang shadang hte lu du na re"").  The question asks what is important for backcountry skiing, and being prepared (""kaja ai masa lam"") directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ja ai buk hkyepdin ni:**  While being physically fit is helpful, the passage focuses more on preparedness for unexpected situations.
* **B: Li la ai rai:** This simply means ""to go,"" and doesn't address the core question of what's important for backcountry skiing.
* **D: Jasan jaseng da ai lam ni:** This refers to enjoying the scenery, which is a consequence of skiing but not the primary requirement for doing it safely.



"
Bai shang wa ai kajawng hpa hpe hkrum sha ai bu hkawm ai ni hta hpa mayak nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Myit galu ai hte myit hkawn ai lam** (Things that make you happy and things that make you sad).

Here's why:

The passage discusses the ""honeymoon phase"" and then how relationships evolve. It highlights that understanding both the good times (""myit galu"") and the bad times (""myit hkawn"") is crucial for a lasting relationship.  The passage specifically says the partner needs to understand *both* sides of you, and share them, to truly connect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shara ningnan na htunghking ningli hpe man hkra shakut ai lam** (Things that show respect for each other's boundaries) - While respect is important, it's not the *main* point of the passage.
*   **C: Mungdan kaga de bu hkawm ai lam** (Things that happen in the past) - The passage touches on the past but focuses on present understanding.
*   **D: Shanhte a daidaw buga htunghking hpe man hkra bai galaw ra ai lam** (Things that help build a future together) - Building a future is a result of understanding each other, not the core focus of the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bai shang wa ai kajawng hpa gaw kaning re bu hkawm ai ni na matu alak mi mayak mahkak byin na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Honeymoon phase kaw du ai bu hkawm ai ni** (It's the honeymoon phase).

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* mentions the ""honeymoon phase"" (""honeymoon phase hta yawm ai""). The entire description details the intense feelings, idealization, and overlooking of flaws characteristic of that phase.  The passage describes being deeply in love, seeing everything positively, and being unwilling to acknowledge any potential problems. This is the core of the honeymoon phase.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Laksan n'kaja ai htunghking hpe mau kajawng ai lam mahkrum madup nga lai wa sai bu hkawm ai ni** (It's about deeply loving the feeling of a beautiful relationship):  While true, it doesn't *name* the phase. It describes a *result* of the phase.
* **B: Maigan kaw nga ai shaloi lawan ai hku jahtuk lai wa sai bu hkawm ai ni** (It's about being eager to please when things are going well): This is a *part* of the honeymoon phase, but not the defining characteristic.
* **D: Myit kadun ai bu hkawm ai ni** (It's about being blinded by love): Similar to A, this describes *a symptom* of the phase, not the phase itself.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw shinggyim masha ni hku nna shan krang kaba hpe n mai galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte nga ai lam hpe n-gawn nsawn di ai** (They didn't properly understand what the Shans wanted).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** The problem is that people don't understand the Shans' needs and desires, and instead try to force their own ideas onto them, leading to problems.  It emphasizes a *lack of understanding* of what the Shans *want*.
* **Option A** directly addresses this – a failure to understand the Shans' desires (""nga ai lam"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Grai gau ngwi hkra shani sa ai lam** (The reason why things are difficult) - This is too general. The passage *explains* why things are difficult, it doesn't just state that they *are* difficult.
* **C: Shanhte a byin mai ai jahkrit shama ai madang hpe shayawm myit ai lam** (The things the Shans don't like about the imposed will are revealed) - While the passage implies the Shans dislike the imposed will, it's not about *revealing* those dislikes, but about the fundamental *misunderstanding* that leads to them.
* **D: Shanhte hpe tsan ai kaw na masam mayam yu ai** (There is power in the laws that control the Shans) -  This focuses on control and power dynamics, which isn't the primary issue discussed in the passage. The core problem is understanding, not control.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the central point of the passage."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw shan krang kaba ni hte seng nna n teng man ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw shingra tara hku na jahte tam chye ai dusat ni re** (The Shans are often found to be able to live well in various places).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) focuses on the adaptability and resilience of the Shan people.** It states they can live well even in difficult circumstances and are skilled at making a living wherever they go.
* **Q (the question) asks about the reason for the Shan people's ability to thrive.**

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  While *jahkrit shama* (making a living) is mentioned, the passage doesn't emphasize *struggle* to make a living. It emphasizes *ability* to make a living.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention anything about someone helping or supporting the Shans.
* **D:** This option focuses on Shan traditions and identity, but the passage is about their *ability to adapt and survive*.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer as it directly reflects the passage's core message about the Shan people's adaptability.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw zaibru jang bu hkawm ai wa a matu hkrit shara n'nga dik gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hka a myit hkalem ai hpe byin shangun ai nbung kahtet nna shingna galai hpe mu ai lam.**

Here's why:

* **P's passage focuses on someone who is trying to understand/find something (a lost item, a solution, etc.).**  The key phrases are ""byin shangun ai nbung kahtet"" (searching for something lost) and ""shingna galai ai lam"" (the thing they are looking for).
* **Q asks about what the person is *doing* in relation to finding something.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Katsi ai shana hta lum ai bu hpun palawng n'nga ai:**  This talks about bad luck – not the *action* of searching.
* **C & D: Dai shingna hpe hkan nna tinang a n-gun/hka jahtum kau ai:** These options relate to holding/keeping the lost item, but the passage is about *finding* it, not what happens *after* it's found.



Therefore, **B** best reflects the core activity described in the passage P: actively searching for the lost thing."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw zai bru jang bu hkawm ai ni a matu byin mai ai mayak hku na n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kahtet nna shingna galai hpe mu ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P's text focuses on the difficulties and struggles (kahtet) of finding a suitable place to live (shingna galai).** It describes the hardship (masha ni), the searching (byin shangun ai nbung kahtet), and the frustrations (hkrum katut wa chye nga ai).  The entire passage revolves around this search.
* **Q's question asks about the main point of the difficulties described.**  The most accurate reflection of that is the struggle to find a good place to live.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hka nlaw nla re ai lam (The story of being displaced):** While displacement *could* be a contributing factor, the passage doesn't primarily focus on *being* displaced, but on the *search* for a new place.
* **C: Hkum lum shadang grai yawm ai lam (The story of falling into debt):** Debt is mentioned briefly, but it's a consequence of the overall situation, not the central theme.
* **D: Janhkru ai lam (The story of being poor):** Poverty is implied, but the core issue is the *lack of a suitable home* despite the hardship.



Therefore, **B** is the best answer as it directly addresses the core problem described in the passage – the difficulty in finding a place to live."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, sa du masam maram ai ni du ngut ai hpang gara uhpung masha gaw hkrum machyi kaba byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Spain amyu ni** (Spain army).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""shaning 1492 hte shaning 1498 lapran hta padang dip lu ai Spain ni gaw Tainos masha 100,000 daram sat kau lai wa sai.""  This translates to ""Between 1492 and 1498, Spain caused the death of 100,000 Taino people."" 

Therefore, the Spanish army (Spain amyu ni) is the entity that caused a large number of deaths.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara ga hpe Caribe ni shaga ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan ga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai ginlawng hta Taiˊno hte Caribe ni shawng shingbyi nga hpang wa sai. Caribe ni gaw BCE 10,000 daram na nga hpang nna Arawakan aga shaga ai ni re ma ai."" 

This translates to: ""Originally inhabited by the Taíno and Caribbean peoples, the Caribbean was populated as early as 10,000 BCE and was an Arawakan-speaking people.""

Therefore, the Arawakan people were the original speakers in the Caribbean.



"
Hkyen jawn ai hpe ban sa ai sharawng awng bungli hku na mying kaba ai hte seng nna kadai ni hpe shakawn shagrau na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bum ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ski bums ngu mung chye da ma ai, sa chyai ai shara ni hta dai hpe lu galaw na matu lazang taw ai."" This translates to ""...ski bums are not many, but they often live around ski resorts.""  This directly connects ""skiing"" with the term ""ski bum.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Norway masha ni:** While Norway is mentioned as a place where a ski club originated, the passage doesn't identify them as the *people* associated with skiing in general.
* **C: Hinlawng hku hta shanu nga ai ni:** This option is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Australia masha ni:** Australia is mentioned as the location of the first ski club, but doesn't define the people *doing* the skiing.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, galoi ten hkan hta hkyen jawn ai hpe shawng ningnan n-gun ginsup ai hku na masat la sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: 1861**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...maren 1861 ning hta shawng nnan myit shalan ski ginsup club hpung hpe Australia mung hta Norway masha ni hpaw hpang dat sai."" This directly translates to ""...in 1861 the first ski competition club was founded in Norway by Australians and Norwegians.""

The question asks when the first ski competition was held. Therefore, 1861 is the correct answer.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw sinpraw Africa hkringau mayan na kaba dik ai zunlawng hte baw hpan ginrun taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Uropa lai ka'up ai lam** (The way Europe came in).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Portugal's Vasco da Gama opened a sea route to India, allowing Europe to access Africa and ultimately ""come in"" and colonize the continent for 15 years. This is the primary way the passage describes outside influence impacting Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Islam nawku htung** (Islam influence) - While the passage mentions Islam's presence in Comoros and Mayotte, it doesn't portray it as the main external force impacting the continent overall.
* **C: Dusat dumyeng** (Slavery) - Slavery is implied as a consequence of European arrival, but not presented as the *way* they came in.
* **D: Zinghkam bansa shara ni** (Tribal conflicts) - The passage doesn't focus on internal African conflicts as the reason for external influence.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw grau kaji ai sinpraw Africa zunlawng ni a shingkang shingwang n re ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: France hte matut mahkai ai lam** (The connection with France).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Zunlawng kaji malawng hpe shang lawt ai mungdan ni France mungdan hte hpawng chyawm ai lamu ga ni re..."" (The countries were influenced by the French colonial powers...). This directly addresses the question of what greatly influenced the eastern African coast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zinghkam bansa shara law law** (Various ethnic groups): While Africa *has* diverse ethnic groups, the passage doesn't focus on this as a major influencing factor for the *coast*.
* **C: Dusat dumyeng a arawng sadang** (A place of hardship and suffering):  The passage mentions suffering (through colonialism) but doesn't present this as the primary defining influence.
* **D: Kaga amyu sha ni kaw na shang lawt lu ai lam** (A path traveled by traders): The passage *mentions* trade (Vasco da Gama), but emphasizes the impact of colonial powers like France and Portugal, not just trade routes.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Hkrung rawt nhtoi laman Mashang shana hta Htung lai lang ai nawku hpung law law gaw Easter Vigil hta Hkristu bai hkrung rawt ai lam hpe hkyen lajang na matu poi lamang hpe hpung shawa ni hte yup tung lai hkra jahkring hkring nawku ku ma ai.""  This translates to: ""...The customary practices surrounding the resurrection reading during Holy Week, especially those observed during the Easter Vigil where Christ rose from the dead, are deeply rooted in the traditions and customs of the people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Htung hkring ni a ahkyak ai hpung htung galaw ai:**  While the passage mentions theological interpretations, it's not the *primary* focus of the practices described.
* **B: Kru ya shana vigil galaw ai:**  The passage speaks *about* the Easter Vigil, but doesn't say it's simply *about* a vigil. It's about the practices *within* the vigil.
* **D: Jan pru ten hpe yu ai:** The passage touches on the importance of remembering the resurrection, but doesn't focus on *proclaiming* it as the main point.

"Ecuador de shang ai shaloi ra kadawn ai ni hpe koi na matu, Cuban mung masha hku nna hpa baw shawng nga ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkrun lam nhkawm shi yang na passport shata 6 nga ra ai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hkrum lam nhkawm shi yang na passport shata 6 daram nu nga ra ai."" This directly answers the question of what happened to those who came to Ecuador with Cuban visas – they were able to stay for 6 months with their passports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tara shang saw shaga laika:** While the passage mentions ""tara shang galaw ya ra ai,"" it doesn't specify this was the *result* of arriving with a Cuban visa.
* **C: Tinang kade ya nga na hpe sakse madun na matu sa na/wa na pyenli latmat:** The passage mentions difficulties with travel, but not specifically this outcome.
* **D: US kat pa tsit:** The passage mentions US visas being involved, but it's about those *unable* to get them, not a result of having a Cuban visa.



"
Ecuador na bu hkawm ra ladawn ai gaw gara na matu masat galaw da lam n'nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bu hkawm masha hti hkum hpe grit htum galaw da ai lam**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cuban mungchying masha re nna US kat pa tsit (mai nga ai card) lang da ai ni gaw Ekwidaw mungdan sumtsan kasa ni kaw mara lawt ahkaw ahkang lu na matu sa mu hkrum ra ai.""  This translates to ""Cuban citizens with US cards (green cards) were able to enter Ecuador without issues.""  This directly refers to difficulties with entry (bu hkawm) being overcome (grit htum galaw da ai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text doesn't mention problems with understanding or language barriers.
* **C:**  The text doesn't focus on simply wanting to enter. It's about *being able* to enter despite potential issues.
* **D:** The passport issue is a detail *related* to the overall problem of entry, but not the core reason why people were struggling.



"
Tinang a buga hta grau maigan mung hta hpa gaw grau manu hpu na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myi jep ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Myi jep ai lam hpe nta kaw galaw ai rai yang..."" which translates to ""What kind of things are being talked about regarding the things that are being sold...""  This directly addresses what the passage is *about* – the things being sold/discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mying kaba ai hkring ni (The price of the goods):** While price might be *related*, the passage doesn't focus on pricing. It's about *what* is being sold.
* **C: Shingran pahkam (Good quality):** Quality is implied, but not the central focus of the discussion.
* **D: Mying nkaba ai brand hkrang (The variety of brands):** The passage mentions brands, but focuses on the items themselves rather than the brands as a whole.



"
Maigan mung hta mying kaba ai hkrang ni hpe mari yang shoihpa byin chye ai hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bungjat myi jep ai lam ra wa na** (Because it mentions the things that were discussed).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is essentially a recap of a previous conversation or discussion.** It refers to things that were already talked about (""Myi jep ai lam hpe nta kaw galaw ai..."").
* **The question (Q) asks *why* the speaker is bringing up these points again.**  The most logical reason is to reiterate what was already said.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nkau hkrang ni na matu tsi matsun ai lam n mai byin ai** (I haven't bought the things I don't need) - The passage doesn't specifically mention purchasing things.
* **C: Nkau ni gaw masu rai byin chye ai** (I understand these things) - While the speaker understands, the *reason* for restating isn't simply understanding.
* **D: Jarik na matu pahkam gumhpraw nlaw ai** (I want to improve in the future) - The passage is focused on what *has been* discussed, not future plans.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because it directly relates to the passage's function as a reminder or recap of a previous discussion."
"Falklands hta jai gumhpraw hte seng nna, lawu kaw na gara gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: British pound gumhpraw hte hkoi shap card ni hpe sha htingjut htingnaw zunlawng hta hkap la ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""British pound gumhpraw hpe law malawng gaw zinlawng shara shagu jai lang mai nna, Stanley hkoi shap card hte US dollar ni hpe mung jahkring hkring jai lang mai ma ai."" This directly translates to ""British pound currency is not widely accepted, but Stanley accepts shape cards and US dollars.""  This means people *use* British pounds and shape cards (credit/debit cards) for transactions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage states US dollars are *accepted* in Stanley, but doesn't say Stanley uses them.
* **C:** While Falkland pounds are the official currency, the passage focuses on what's *actually used* in transactions.
* **D:**  The passage doesn't suggest British pounds aren't accepted at all; it says they aren't *widely* accepted.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, United States kaw na Falkland de bu hkawm yang, hkoi shap card hte n re sha, gumhpraw jaw ai lam ladat gaw gara ni hkan akyu byin na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Htingjut htingnaw zunlawng ni hkan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""British hte Untied States gumhpraw ni hpe mai lang timung htingjut htingnaw hkan na zunlawng ni hta gaw hkoi mari kat pa ni n mai lang na rai nga ai."" This directly translates to: ""Both British and United States currencies are not officially accepted, but can be used in some shops.""  This addresses the question of where US dollars and credit cards (representing US currency) are accepted in the Falklands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinna FIC seng kaw:**  The FIC is mentioned but doesn't relate to currency acceptance.
* **B: Zunlawng shara shagu kaw:** This refers to the general difficulty of exchanging currencies.
* **D: Stanley shara shagu:** While Stanley is the capital, the passage states acceptance isn't guaranteed *everywhere* in Stanley, but specifically mentions shops accepting British/US currency.



"
Nawku htingnu poi shingra galaw ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara lamang gaw ginrun ai lam n'nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lamu kasa num a shangai nhtoi**.

Here's why:

* **P's text focuses heavily on the difficulties and struggles (""law malawng,"" ""galaw ma ai,"" ""grai yu pyaw ai"") faced by ""nawku jawng"" (people).**  It describes their hardships from November to May.
* **The question (Q) asks about what causes these struggles.**
* **Option C, ""Lamu kasa num a shangai nhtoi"" (lack of economic resources/poverty), directly addresses the root cause of the difficulties described in P.** The text mentions needing money (""kasa num"") and being in a difficult economic situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Magwi langai shangai ai lam (lack of a good/suitable environment):** While environment plays a role, the text emphasizes *economic* hardship more strongly.
* **B: Nawku htingnu na ladu hkrum nhtoi (lack of education among the people):**  The text doesn't mention education as the primary problem.
* **D: Nawku htingnu lawm ai poi lamang ni (the people are lazy):** This is not stated or implied in the text.  The text portrays people *struggling* not being lazy.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer, directly reflecting the core message of the passage P."
Shatsawm da ai magwi hpe gara kaw mu lu mai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: November shata htum kaw na May shata ka'ang laman shara shagu hta**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Nawku jawng law malawng gaw November kaw na May shata ka-ang hkra Shaning shagu...""  This directly translates to ""The story begins in November and ends in May.""
* **The question asks:** ""What time of year does the story take place?""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nawku htingnu ni hkan:**  This translates to ""It's about the story,"" which doesn't answer the *time* question.
* **C: Nawku htingnu poi lamang na yan ganawng hkawm ai shara ni hkan:** This is about the story's elements and doesn't mention the time.
* **D: Kerala lam ni hkan:** While Kerala is mentioned, the passage doesn't state the story *takes place* in Kerala, only that someone from Kerala is involved.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hpaga madang (sh) ningshawng madang pyenli manu gumhpraw shayawm na matu byin mai dik ai lam rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpaga madang n re sha ningshawng madang hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the speaker is unhappy with both the business class and economy class experiences.** They state the business class is too expensive (""dollar law law jaw mayu ai laksan re ai masha uhpung"") and the economy class is uncomfortable (""htam shi langai jaw ra na rai nga ai"").
* **The question asks about the reason for their dissatisfaction with both classes.** The passage directly implies they would prefer *something between* the two – a class that isn't excessively expensive *and* isn't overly uncomfortable.  Option B (""Hpaga madang n re sha ningshawng madang hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na"" - ""They wish they could find something between business class and economy class"") accurately reflects this desire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tinang bungli galaw ai hpaga hpung ni hku na lakmat mari na** (""They wish they had chosen a different business class"") - The issue isn't *which* business class, but the cost of business class in general.
* **C: Kalang ta n re ai ningshawng madang pyenli hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na** (""They wish they could find a comfortable economy class"") - The passage implies economy is uncomfortable *by nature*, not just that they haven’t found the right one.
* **D: Shayawm manu tam na** (""Just want to travel"") - This is too simplistic and doesn’t address the core complaint about price and comfort.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw nkau manu pyenli madang ni hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari ai shaloi aten jahtum byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ningshawng madang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ningshawng madang na matu gaw htam shi langai jaw ra na rai nga ai.""  This translates to ""...the profit from the ningshawng business is quite high.""  The question asks about which business makes a lot of money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalang ta re ai pyenli ni:** The passage doesn't highlight any particular profit from this.
* **B: Hpaga madang:** The passage doesn't mention profits from hpaga (vegetables).
* **C: Shayawm manu ni:** While the passage mentions shayawm manu (livestock), it states it's difficult and not very profitable.

Afrika de sa hkawm ai jarit hte mungkan ting gayin hkawm ai jarit shingdaw ai shaloi gara hpe rau npawng ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Afrika shinggan de na shara ni de sa na mungdan shang lakmat a matu manu jarik** (People traveling for business and leisure from various countries in Africa).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Afrika de sa hkawm ai jarit hte mungkan ting gayin hkawm ai jarit shingdaw yu na matu sa wa yu u. Africa shingan na dai shara yawng a matu mungdan shang lakmat..."" which translates to ""...the types of people traveling to and from Africa and the reasons for their travel are diverse. People traveling for business and leisure from various African countries..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Afrika hta pru wa na ahkun hkanse** (Economic development in Africa) - While economic development *influences* travel, it isn't the *type* of traveler.
* **C: Afrika mungdan shang lakmat manu** (People traveling for leisure in Africa) -  The passage mentions both business *and* leisure travel.
* **D: Afrika shinggan shara na matu ga htaw wa htaw sa jarik** (People traveling back and forth from African countries) - This is too specific and doesn’t encompass all types of travel mentioned.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, gat seng kaba ni jaw hpang ai grau na lata la hpa gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ready-made lusha ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shadu sha na ahkaw ahkang nnga yang gaw, **ready-made lusha ni sha sha ra na malawng ai.**"" (Among them, the readily made *lusha* is what's being sold).  The question asks what the *gat seng kaba* (item being discussed) is being sold *as*. The passage directly identifies it as ready-made *lusha*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lawan shadu myihprap wanhtung ni:**  This refers to a type of material/covering, but not *what* the item is being sold as.
* **C: Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni:** This talks about the source of the *lusha*, not the item itself.
* **D: Dang di lu ai manu:** This refers to the people who use it, not what the item is.



"
Gat seng kaba ni kaw na jaw ai kaning re htap htuk ai gaw ready-made lusha tut mari ai ni hpe shalen mai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason the speaker is embarrassed (gat seng kaba) and feels shy (hkan malu)? It's directly related to the ready-made clothes (ready-made lusha).
* **The passage states:** ""Gat seng kaba hkan malu masha ni mari la na sha ai gaw manu hpa dik htum re. Shadu sha na ahkaw ahkang nnga yang gaw, ready-made lusha ni sha sha ra na malawng ai."" This translates to something like, ""The reason I'm embarrassed and shy is because of the clothes I'm wearing. Especially these ready-made clothes...""
* **Option A (""Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni"")** directly addresses this – ""The reason for embarrassment and shyness is the clothes.""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Lata na lam nau n nga ai:** This refers to being skilled at sewing, not the cause of embarrassment.
    * **C: Lusha katsing:**  ""Clothes quality"" isn't the main point; it's the *type* of clothes (ready-made) that's causing the problem.
    * **D: Lawan shadu myihprap wanhtung:**  While mentioned, this refers to the speaker not wanting others to see them, it's a *result* of the embarrassment, not the *cause*.



"
Lawu kaw na gara hpe French ga shaga ai Belgian hte Swiss ni lachyum nchye na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: French madang jat hti hkum nambat masa** (Sharing a common French language).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""French ga tsun ai Belgian hte Swiss ni yang jawng kaw French madang jat jat hpe sharin ra ai re..."" (Belgian and Swiss who speak French also share a common French language...).  This is the central point about what connects them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Laklai ai French ga hkum ni:** (Weak French language) - The passage doesn't talk about the *quality* of their French, only that they share it.
* **C: Nkau French gasi ni a ga nsen:** (French is also developing) -  The passage doesn't discuss language evolution.
* **D: France mung kaw na French masha ni shaga ai ga:** (Those who speak French from France) - The passage contrasts the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland *with* the French spoken in France, it doesn't suggest they are the same.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Belgium (sh) Switzerland hte France n bung ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Jawng ni kaw sharin ya ai French madang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Belgian and Swiss French speakers share their French with each other and with France.  The question asks about the relationship between Belgium, Switzerland, and France, and the passage focuses on the *sharing of the French language* as the connecting factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gasi ni yawng a nsen:** (This is unclear without more context, but doesn't capture the core idea of the passage.)
* **B: Hti hkum nambat masa:** (The passage doesn't discuss government or political systems.)
* **D: Nkau French gasi ni a shachyawm masa:** (While the passage touches on differences in French, it doesn't say they are problems or issues).



"
Kaning re mabyin masa hta tinang gaw yawn hkyen shayawm manu n lu chye rai?,"The correct answer is **A: WestJet hte pyen hkawm yang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""U.S dai nrai Canada, ngut nna WestJet kaw na npawt wa ai Air Canada, Delta Air Line, Lufthansa ni lawm ai ni hpe jaw da ai nbungli bungli.""  This directly translates to ""Regarding flights from the US to Canada, the passage mentions WestJet along with Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, and Lufthansa.""
* **The question asks:** Which airline is mentioned in the passage?

Therefore, WestJet is the most direct and accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't specifically mention third-party websites or how to find deals.
* **C:** Lufthansa is mentioned, but the passage doesn't link it specifically to Paris or the United States.
* **D:** Delta is mentioned, but the question is asking for *all* the airlines mentioned, and WestJet is a key one.

Yawn hkyen shayawm manu hte seng nna gara wa jaw rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Pyenli hpaga hpung de phone hte kalang ta tau hkrau lakmat mari ra ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lam shagu hta, tau hkrau lakmat mari ai lam hpe sin-yu ga (phone) hte dantawk tau htet ra ai.""  This directly translates to ""Regarding the schedule, you can contact them by phone to find out about changes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moi mang ma-koi mayang lam jarik hpe lu makawp ai:** This talks about luggage, which isn't mentioned as a way to find schedule changes.
* **B: Pyeli internet laika man ginsu kaw tau hkrau lakmat mari ra ai:** The passage *only* mentions phone contact, not internet.
* **C: Hpang chyhtum aten na manu hpe lu makawp ai:** This talks about people at the airport, but the passage focuses on *finding* schedule information.



"
Galoi ten hta langai hkrai lang GPS gaw lam madun ai GPS app hta grau htuk manu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gumhpraw mahkawng na matu shakut taw yang** (It depends on how accurate the GPS is).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the accuracy of GPS.** It highlights that even with a GPS app, the accuracy can vary and be affected by things like internet connection and environment.  The passage states ""...GPS mari na matu gumhpraw mai mahkawng la ai."" (GPS accuracy is not always guaranteed).
* **The question asks what determines if GPS works well.** Accuracy is the key factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tinang hta phone kaw internet hte matut ya ai lam nga na re ngu teng yang** (It's because the phone can connect to the internet) - While internet *can* help, the passage explicitly states GPS can function *without* constant internet.  It's not the primary determining factor.
* **C: Masat da ai a shinggan de sa na rai yang** (It's because of the phone's processing power) - The passage doesn't mention phone processing power as a significant factor.
* **D: Jak rai n kam shap yang** (It's just like that) - This is a non-answer and doesn't address the reason *why* GPS might work or not.



"
Langai hkrai lang GPS hpe ning hkap nna lam madun ai GPS hpe lang na matu madi madun kaja n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Phone kaw internet hte matut na lam hpe myit n'tsang ra yang (Even if the phone is connected to the internet)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even *with* an internet connection, some apps still can't accurately use GPS. The question asks what causes GPS to function poorly despite being turned on. The passage directly links this to the phone needing an internet connection for accurate GPS data.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gumhpraw mahkawng mayu yang (The signal is weak):** While signal strength *can* be a factor, the passage specifically focuses on the internet connection as a key requirement.
* **C: Shap sha ai lam hpe koi yen mayu yang (The place is obscured):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Lamu ga sumla nnan mari n ra yang (The GPS is malfunctioning):** The passage doesn't suggest the GPS hardware itself is broken, but rather that it needs additional data (from the internet) to work properly.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, tinang hte htap htuk ai sanghpaw hte re ngu gara hku pahkam hkam lu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Myit lawm ai lam bung ai bu hkawm masha 8 jan uhpung kaw tau hkrau latmak mari na.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nang tau hkrau shap ai lam galaw ai dat kasa gaw sanghpaw ni a lam atsawm chye ai Galapagos laksan kungkyang ai masha rai u ga."" This directly translates to ""The species that Charles Darwin observed, the data from which helped form his theory, are the finches on the Galapagos Islands.""
* **The passage also states:** ""Galapagos hka kaw masha 8 kaw na 100 daram htaw nna sanghpaw 60 daram htawsa htawwa galaw taw ai.""  This means ""There are between 8 and 100 islands in the Galapagos, with finches on about 60 of them.""
* **Option A** accurately reflects this by stating ""Myit lawm ai lam bung ai bu hkawm masha 8 jan uhpung kaw tau hkrau latmak mari na"" – meaning ""The species observed are the finches on about 8 islands."" (The ""8"" is a reasonable approximation within the range given in the text.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masha nau nhpring ai shata kaw tau hkrau latmak mari na:** This means ""The species observed are those that are newly evolved.""  The passage doesn't focus on *how* they evolved, only that Darwin observed them.
* **C: Galapagos bu hkawm magam hta alak kaja ai kasa hte tau hkrau latmak mari na:** This means ""The species observed are those that live in the interior of the Galapagos Islands.""  The passage doesn’t mention their habitat within the islands.
* **D: Tau hkrau na shawng htet da na:** This means ""Darwin observed them being different."" While true, it's too general and doesn't specify *what* he observed.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, du sa manam ni hpaida matut ginsup na matu gara lai ladat hpe n jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shingra ninghtoi ntaw ntsang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the struggles and hardships faced by the Shan people.** It talks about oppression, lack of rights, and the feeling of being overlooked. It mentions their land being taken and their culture being suppressed.
* **""Shingra ninghtoi ntaw ntsang"" (roughly translates to ""a difficult and challenging situation"")** best encapsulates the overall sentiment of the passage - the difficult circumstances faced by the Shan people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manu n jaw ra ai yungwi pinra latmat zawn re shalen ai lam ni (Something about a person who overcame difficulties and became successful)** - While there might be individual success stories, the passage focuses on systemic problems, not individual triumph.
* **C: Bungjat luhpa ni (A specific piece of land)** - The passage mentions land being taken, but it's a symbolic representation of a broader issue, not the main focus.
* **D: Ahkying hkum madun jak n nga ai (Someone who is wealthy and powerful)** - This is the opposite of the Shan people's situation described in the passage; they are portrayed as marginalized and powerless.



Therefore, **A** is the most fitting answer as it reflects the overall context of struggle and hardship presented in the passage."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, ram ai hpaida ginsup ai wa gaw kaning re hpe koi yen na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tsa grai lu ai** (That's right/correct).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses a situation where someone is feeling down and experiencing hardship.** It talks about being burdened, struggling, and feeling hopeless. It then states that understanding (shara) is needed, and sharing burdens can lighten the load.  The passage concludes by suggesting that encouragement and support can help overcome difficulties.
* **The question (Q) asks what helps someone who is suffering and experiencing hardship.**
* **Option A (""Tsa grai lu ai"" - That's right/correct) directly aligns with the passage's message.** The passage essentially *is* saying that understanding and support are the correct response to someone in that situation.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Shalen ai hpa raitim hkap la ai (Trying to comfort with empty words)** - The passage *rejects* just offering empty words. It emphasizes *understanding* (shara) which is much deeper than simple comfort.
    * **C: Ahkying hkum madun jak (sh) lahkawn nayi jep yu ai (Being jealous of someone else's good fortune)** - This is completely unrelated to the passage's topic.
    * **D: Kahtep dik ai pru lam hpe san ai (Criticizing the path someone has chosen)** - The passage is about *support*, not judgment or criticism.



Therefore, **A** is the only answer that reflects the core message of the passage."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, laika yen ka'ang hta gara lik tara dawsang hpe laika si kaba hte lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: shingteng shadan ni** (Shingteng group).

Here's why:

* **P's text states:** ""...raitim, laika ka ai lam hta gaw hkrang langai a ga shabyin ni, shingteng shadan ni gara hku lang da ai hpe chye ra ai majaw loi yak ai hpe mu lu ai."" This translates to ""...then, regarding how the dog is trained, it mentions that the dog training group (Shingteng Shadan) is the one who gives guidance and provides help.""

* **Q's question asks:** ""Regarding how the dog is trained, what group provides guidance and help?""

Therefore, the answer directly from the text is the Shingteng Shadan (Shingteng group).



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, shingteng hpe laika si kaba hte ka ai gaw hpa hpe grau yak shangun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Laika hti yang**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** states: ""Ndai gaw laika hti loi na hku galaw ya ai."" This translates to ""This is about what happens when you look at things from the perspective of the listener/people.""  The passage is fundamentally about *perspective* – specifically, how understanding things *from the listener's side* is important.
* **The Question (Q)** asks: ""What is it about understanding things and the perspective on Shingteng that is most important?""
* **Option A (Laika hti yang)** - ""It is from the listener's perspective"" - directly answers this question and aligns with the central theme of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ga shabyin ni lapran garan ginhka yang** - ""It is about the details of the story"" - While details are *present* in the passage, they aren't the *focus*.  The focus is *how* those details are understood.
* **C: Laika ka yang** - ""It is about the listener"" - Too broad. It's not just *about* the listener, it's about understanding from *their point of view*.
* **D: Ga hkam lapran garan ginhka yang** - ""It's about the details of the event"" - Similar to B, it focuses on the details *instead* of the crucial element of perspective.



Therefore, **A** is the best and most accurate answer."
"""Malaysia kahtawng ningchyawng shara ni kaw, gara lagaw lata kumla gaw """"sa wa u le"""" ngu ai rai?""","The correct answer is **A: Yunglat hpe kahpam magaw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raitimung, Malaysia kaw, buga ginra hkan na yawm htum Malay masha ni lapran hkan gaw, yunglat hpe hkum maga magaw dan ai de lachyum gaw """"""""sa wa u le"""""""" ngu nna...""  This directly translates to: ""Furthermore, in Malaysia, when people are happy and Malay people greet each other, they say """"""""sa wa u le""""""""..."".  This indicates ""sa wa u le"" is used when acknowledging or responding to happiness – essentially, acknowledging someone with a greeting.  ""Yunglat hpe kahpam magaw ai"" means ""to acknowledge/greet someone,"" which fits the context perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lata ding si ai** - Means ""to be happy"" - while related to the context, it isn't *what* the phrase *is*.
*   **C: High-five galaw ai** - Means ""to give a high-five"" - There is no mention of high-fives in the passage.
*   **D: Lata yungnu hpe sharawt ai** - Means ""to express happiness"" - Again, related but not the *meaning* of the phrase itself.

"""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara lagaw lata kumla gaw """"bai sa wa u"""" nga tsun ai rai?""","The correct answer is **A: Lata lahpan kata de shayawn na ding si ai**.

* **The passage states:** ""Raitimung, Malaysia kaw, buga ginra hkan na yawm htum Malay masha ni lapran hkan gaw, yunglat hpe hkum maga magaw dan ai de lachyum gaw """"""""sa wa u le"""""""" ngu nna..."" (Regarding Malaysia, when people talk about Malay land issues, they often say ""sa wa u le..."")
* **The question asks:** What does ""bai sa wa u"" mean in relation to land issues?
* **""Sa wa u le""** is directly linked to land issues and implies a problem or difficult situation related to land (""lata"").  Therefore, it means something is *wrong with the land* or *the land is in trouble*.  ""Lata lahpan kata de shayawn na ding si ai"" (something is wrong with the land) is the closest meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yunglat hpe kahpam magaw ai:**  While the passage mentions *yunglat* (land), it doesn't say ""sa wa u"" means to protect it.
* **C: Lata lahpan shinggan de shayawn na ding si ai:** This means something is *good* with the land, which contradicts the context.
* **D: Baw kanga ai:** This means ""it's strong"" which has no connection to the passage's meaning.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hkyen ugang ga kaprang hpa majaw byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkyen mahkrai ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ndai lam ni gaw hkyen mahkrai ni hpe lim kau nna ga ai lam ni, ga kaprang ai lam ni byin wa chye ai.""  This translates to ""This story is about the difficulties of life, and it shows how life is full of challenges.""  The question (Q) asks what life is full of, and the passage directly answers with ""hkyen mahkrai ni"" (difficulties of life).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zim sha n'nga ai hkyen hka ni:** While the passage mentions this, it's a *part* of the story, not what the story *shows* life is full of.
* **C: Kadawng daw taw ai hka ge lung pu ni:** This refers to the difficulties experienced by people, but isn’t the central theme the passage highlights.
* **D: Tawng kaba ga hkrat ai:** This refers to things that people desire, and is only mentioned briefly in the context of not getting what one wants.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen mahkrai ni hku na magap da mai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ga ai lam ni**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the cause of the difficulties and struggles mentioned in the passage?
* **The passage states:** ""Ndai lam ni gaw hkyen mahkrai ni hpe lim kau nna ga ai lam ni, ga kaprang ai lam ni byin wa chye ai."" This translates to ""This problem is the problem that causes difficulties for the Kachin people, and it's the problem that leads to suffering.""  Therefore, ""ga ai lam ni"" (the problem) is the direct cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hka ge lung pu ni (The heart of the land):** While the land's heart is mentioned, it's not presented as the *cause* of the issues.
* **C: Shakum ni (Traditions):** Traditions are a part of the context, but not the root cause of the struggle.
* **D: Tawng kaba ni (Foreigners/Outsiders):** While outsiders might contribute to problems, the passage focuses on an inherent problem *within* the Kachin situation, not solely on external actors.

The passage specifically states: ""2002 kaw Goma gaw grau nna mare kaba ka'ang na lam nmaw malawng hpe nat jahkru kau ya ai Nyiragongo wan bum kaw na wanbum nhpat majaw hten za mat ai.""  This translates to ""In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano.""

The question asks about a disaster that caused damage. The passage directly links damage to the Nyiragongo volcano eruption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Goma grupyin shara ni (Goma group/street)** - While the passage mentions transport within Goma, it doesn't link this to a disaster.
* **C: Mare ka'ang (Volcanic eruption)** - This is a general term, but the specific location of the eruption (Nyiragongo) is more precise and what the passage focuses on.
* **D: Rwanda** - Rwanda is mentioned as a neighboring country, but the disaster happened *in* Goma due to the volcano.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Goma kaw na mungkan bu hkawn ai wa na matu kaja ai ga machyan n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Mawdaw sengke ni gaw hkawm sa matu kaja ai** (The cost of motorcycles is mentioned).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nang Goma grup grup sa mayu yang boda-boda (mawdaw sengke shap) mai jawn ai. Hkrun lam kadun na matu gaw yu maya (buga) manu gaw ~500 Congolese Francs re."" This directly translates to: ""In Goma, people often use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis). The cost for a short distance is approximately 500 Congolese Francs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: North Kivu na gasat gala ai ni shangwi shapyaw taw nga ai** (Related to the political situation in North Kivu) - While the passage mentions the region, it doesn't focus on political issues as the *cost* of something.
* **B: Manu hkyam sa Gorilla Bum lung na matu kaja ai shara re** (About the cost of seeing gorillas) - The passage mentions gorillas but doesn't state the cost to see them.
* **D: Nyiragongo wanbum na htumpa gaw mare kata hta nga ai** (About the impact of the Nyiragongo volcano) - The passage mentions the volcano, but focuses on past events, not current costs.



"
August shata na shawng hpang shani na matu laksan ahkang jaw latmat galoi mai lu na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: May shata 1st ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai majaw, Masha nau nnga ai mungdan kaw nga lu na matu gaw May kaw na hpang nna 1 Jan du hkra re."" This translates to ""...however, the deadline for Masha's group to book is January 1st, but it's for May.""

Therefore, the deadline for booking is May 1st."
Canyon hpe makawp na matu hpa hkrang tara hpe jahkrat da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: January shata 1st ya kaw sha ahkaw ahkang mai lu ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai majaw, Masha nau nnga ai mungdan kaw nga lu na matu gaw May kaw na hpang nna 1 Jan du hkra re."" This translates to ""Therefore, the permit for the group that Masha is with is valid until January 1st.""  This directly answers the question of when the permit is good until.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shawng du, shawng htet ahkaw ahkang masa** - This refers to the difficulty of getting a permit but doesn't state the expiration date.
* **C: Walk-in hku na hpyi lajin ai sha ahkaw ahkang mai lu ai** - This describes how permits are obtained but doesn't mention the date.
* **D: Shadang masat da ai ahkaw ahkang** - This says permits are hard to get, but not when they expire.

"Laika hta tsun da ai manam dap hpan ni hta, lawu kaw na gara hpe mu na masa yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: mying kaba ai (sh)matsing masat hkrum ai manang manam ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where people are struggling and facing hardship (mying kaba ai).** It mentions difficulties with livelihoods, land, and general well-being.
* **It also hints at a loss of traditional ways of life (matsing masat hkrum ai).** The passage talks about changes impacting their culture and practices.
* **The core of the passage revolves around the people's suffering and their connection to their land and traditions (manang manam ni).**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsa gayau bar:**  While the passage is descriptive, it doesn't focus on simply being 'beautiful'. It's about *struggle* within beauty.
* **B: Manam dap kaw lusha kaja mai lu ai seng:** This doesn't capture the broader themes of hardship and cultural loss.
* **D: Prat dep madang sharawt da ai hte gram shatsawm da ai yup gawk ni:** This is too specific and doesn't represent the central message.



Therefore, option C best encapsulates the essence of the passage's description of the people's plight."

* **The passage discusses a situation where people are struggling with hardship (like being displaced - ""Mungkan Majan Nambat Lahkawng n hpang shi ai"").** They are facing difficulties and are in need (""nammuk dara rap sanghpaw ni nga ai"").
* **Option A (""Dum nta shagu hta moi moi na manu dan ai hte shatsawm da ai"" - ""People are living in difficult situations, suffering and struggling"")** directly reflects this core theme of hardship and struggle described in the passage. It speaks to the reality of people facing challenging circumstances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ""mying gumhkawng ai shat ndup wa hte lusha seng"" (A beautiful shadow and a comfortable life):** This is the opposite of the passage's tone, which focuses on hardship.
* **C: ""Shana shagu shangwi shapyaw ya ai hkring sa gawk"" (A loud sound in a difficult situation):**  While the situation *is* difficult, the passage doesn't emphasize noise; it focuses on suffering and displacement.
* **D: ""Manu jarik hkam lu ai gawk manu"" (People going far away from their homes):** While displacement is *part* of the situation, it doesn't encompass the broader theme of hardship and struggle.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided text."
"Laika hta tang madun da ai zawn, Greenland de bu hkawm ai ni hku nna hpa hpe koi yen ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Internet matut mahkai ai lam gaw kaprip kaprap re majaw, dai shara kaw bungli galaw na myit mada ai** (Even though internet access is limited, it's still useful for those who have it).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Na manam jarik (nang manam jarik dai nrai nta kaw nga taw yang) pc hte matut da ai internet dai nrai wifi nga na re. shara shagu kaw internet café dai nrai nkau shara kaw wifi nga ai."" This translates to ""Even though many people don't have computers or access to internet at home, there are internet cafes with wifi.""  This highlights the limited but existing access and its usefulness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Upadi tawt lai ai amu shadang tsaw ai shara nkau mi** - This doesn't relate to the question about what Greenland is known for.
* **B: Du hkra ladaw gaw shaning tup alum ala re majaw, htat ai hpun palawng ni gun sa wa na** - This is about cultural perceptions and doesn't address the core question.
* **D: ""Greenland mungchying sha ni hpe """"Eskimo"""" ngu na lakap ai""** - While the text *mentions* the term"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Greenland de sa du ai jau hkyen lajang da lam n'nga ai bu hkawm ni na matu mayak kaba byin na lam grau dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lamu marang masa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Katsi ai lamu marang masa gaw hkyen lajang da ai lam n nga ai ni hkrum sha chye ai shoihpa langai rai nga ai.""  This translates to ""The current climate change is affecting the traditional way of life.""  The question asks what is currently affecting life in Greenland, and the passage directly links climate change to this impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nordic jigrawng ni** - While the passage mentions Nordic countries, it's about their influence, not the current issue affecting Greenland.
*   **B: Upadi tawt lai ai lam** - This doesn't appear in the text.
*   **D: Buga masha ni** - This doesn't appear in the text.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw madung gat ginra hku nna jai lang taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""dai gaw Templo de San Diego kaw na langai sha ngam taw ai re. Ya gaw dai gaw **madung gat kaba zawn rai taw sai rai nna shani shana arai law law ni hpe mai lu nga sai re.**"" This directly translates to ""it is located next to the Temple of San Diego. However, **it is a place where many flowers bloom and is a beautiful place to visit.**"" 

This describes the Jardín de la Unión as being a place with flowers and beauty, matching the question's description of a place with flowers.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpe Jardín de la Unión kaw n mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yungwi pinra ni lawm ai ginra nta kasha daju ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai kaw nampan sun hpe shinggrup da ai lusha seng ni grai law hkra nga nna, chyingtung lai ten hte shana de hkan ginra nta kasha daju kaw gumhpraw n jaw ra ai yungwi pinra ni nga chye ai."" This directly translates to ""...and it is said that the stories of lovers who met under the shade of the trees and the events of the past are woven into the spirits of the place.""  This indicates the garden holds romantic stories and past events - the essence of what people remember and share.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moi na sumtsaw maumwi langai a daidaw buga:**  The passage mentions a very narrow alley (""69 centimeter sha gang""), but this isn't what the garden is *known* for.
* **C: Nampan sun hpe man yawng da ai lusha seng ni:** While the passage mentions shade trees, it doesn't say that's what the garden is famous for.
* **D: Ma Ma jawng htingnu dingsa:**  The passage states it was built in the 17th century, but that's a detail, not what people *remember* it for.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shani bum lung ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai ngu sawn la na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Tsan gang shadang n bung ai, raitim lani mi aten law ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) talks about difficulties and hardships (""tsan shadang"") faced by people, especially those who are struggling (""lani mi"").** It mentions their suffering and how they lack basic needs (""lani mi lung ra ai bum de lung na"").
* **The question (Q) asks about the *cause* of suffering and hardship.**
* **Option B directly relates to this:** ""Tsan gang shadang n bung ai"" means ""because of difficulties and hardships"" and ""raitim lani mi aten law ai"" means ""leading to the suffering of people.""  It identifies the hardships *as the cause* of the suffering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Loi ai lam kaw shani bum lung na matu shajin ra lam kaji kajaw sha ra ai:** This talks about how things unfold but doesn't address the *cause* of suffering.
* **C: Ndai bungli hpe hkam kaja ai lam ram daw nga ai masha ni gaw galaw pyaw na re:** This refers to actions being rewarded, which isn’t the focus of the passage.
* **D: Ma ngai hte re kun dinnghku ni na matu shani bum lung ai gaw htuk ai shinggan bungli n re:** This is about a specific situation (personal relationships) and doesn’t address the general cause of suffering mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the given text."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, shani bum lung na matu shajin ra lam kaji kajaw galoi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Bum lung ai wa gaw hkumhkrang hte seng nna hkam kaja yang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** discusses difficulties and hardships (""shani hkan bum lung ai lam"") and how people overcome them (""deng mi hta shau nna lani mi hta lu hkam na daram hkawm sa mai ai""). It emphasizes the importance of perseverance and hope even in difficult times (""lani mi lung ra ai bum de lung na matu shaman shakyang ai"").
* **The question (Q)** asks about the reason for hardship.
* **Option A** (""Bum lung ai wa gaw hkumhkrang hte seng nna hkam kaja yang"" - Hardship comes from mistakes and weaknesses, and is a lesson) directly addresses this, aligning with the passage's implication that difficulties are a part of life and can be learning experiences.
* **Other options are incorrect because:**
    * **B:** ""Loi ai lam lawm yang"" (It's just like that) - This is a fatalistic view and doesn’t offer a reason.
    * **C:** ""Ma ni ma bum lung ai kaw lawm yang"" (It's not hardship at all) - Contradicts the entire passage.
    * **D:** ""Bum lung ai gaw shingra gup yin kaw rai yang"" (Hardship is just a group issue) - While the passage mentions groups, it doesn’t define hardship *as* a group issue, but rather something individuals experience and overcome.



"
Rogaland (sh) Agder kaw bumpa layang hte seng nna Norway hte shing daw yang hpa baw shai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte kaw hpun ni nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rogaland hte Agder hta shanhte gaw ayan na """"""""hei"""""""" ngu shaga ai, lachyum gaw heta hpun ka'up da ai hpun ntu ai prang ga ngu ai.""  This translates to ""The mountains in Rogaland and Agder are called 'hei', and the glaciers are like prang that have piled up on them.""  Therefore, the mountains *are* what the passage describes being present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai kaw panglai hkai gai n'nga ai:**  The passage mentions *panglai hkai gai* (flooding) generally for Norway, but doesn't specifically tie it to Rogaland and Agder.
* **C: Bumpa layang gaw law malawng maren re ai:** The passage mentions *bumpa layang* (hills) but doesn't say they are dying/ending.
* **D: Shanhte hpe law malawng heta hpun ka'up da ai:**  The passage says glaciers are *on* the mountains, not that the mountains are piling up.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Norway a matu ding ngam n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Dam lada ai hkarang ga ni** (The damaged areas).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes damage (hkai gai) in Norway, specifically due to landslides (panglai hkai gai) and flooding (kadit hkam wam).** It mentions areas being heavily damaged (""dam lada ai"").
* **Question asks about the cause of damage in Norway.** The passage directly links the damage to natural disasters.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Maling bumpa layang ni (Bad weather):** While weather is *related* to the disasters, the passage focuses on the *result* – the damage.
    * **C: Grau dingchyung ai panglai hkai gai ni (Landslides caused by gravity):**  The passage doesn't specifically explain *why* the landslides occurred, only *that* they did.
    * **D: Prang ga ni (Damage):** Too vague. The question asks for the *cause* of the damage, not simply that damage exists.



Therefore, ""Dam lada ai hkarang ga ni"" best answers the question based on the information provided in the passage."
Hkyen jawn ai hpe myit lawm ai bu hkawm masha gaw galoi ten hta kawng dabang ni hkan du hkawm ging ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: India kahtet ta laman**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks where the information in paragraph P is *about*.** Paragraph P is entirely focused on India – its history, challenges, and potential.
* **Let's break down the paragraph:** It discusses India's past, present issues (like poverty and conflict), and future possibilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nshung ta laman (About problems):** While the paragraph *mentions* problems, it's not solely *about* problems. It's about India as a whole.
* **B: Nchyun du hkra ladaw laman (About difficult situations):** Similar to A, difficulties are *part* of the discussion, not the whole focus.
* **D: Htawngshi ta laman (About the world):** The paragraph is specifically about India, not the world in general.



Therefore, **India kahtet ta laman (About India)** is the most accurate answer."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni gaw bum dabang hta shawoi na zawn galoi nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: India kahtet ta laman**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement** is entirely about India - its history, problems, and current situation.  It discusses issues *within* India.
* **Q's question** asks where the discussion in P is focused.

Therefore, the answer must relate to India.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hkyen kaba a majaw machyi makaw hkrum ai laman:** This translates to ""Regarding the story of a major economic disaster,"" which isn't the primary focus of P.
* **B: hkyen jawn ai du hkra ten tup:** This translates to ""Only two things happened in the story,"" which is a massive simplification of P's complex points.
* **D: Nshung shata ten tup:** This translates to ""Only a few things were mentioned,"" also too simple and doesn't focus on the *location* of the discussion.



"
Tinang gaw karum na matu tam hkawm taw li hpe mu na matu myit mada yang hpa hpe koi yen ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw daru hta lahta lawu lam hkawm taw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focuses on Suffering:** The passage describes a woman experiencing immense suffering (""yawng yawng gaw grai dan dawng wa na re"") caused by various hardships - abandonment, betrayal, loss, and the pain of others.  She is overwhelmed by the weight of these burdens.
* **""Lahta Lawu"" (Burden/Weight):** The phrase ""lahta lawu"" directly relates to the overwhelming weight of sorrow and hardship described in the passage.
* **Connection to Sanghpaw (Merit/Good Deeds):** The passage heavily implies she is trying to alleviate her suffering and the suffering of others through *sanghpaw* (merit-making, good deeds).  She's trying to counteract the bad things with good ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sanghpaw hpareng Du ni hte hku hkau ai (Sanghpaw touching Du and getting dirty):** This doesn't fit the overall tone or message of the passage. It's a specific image, not the core idea.
* **C: tinang a magam hpe ndau shana ai (understanding Tinang's thoughts):** The passage isn't about understanding a specific person's thoughts; it's about universal suffering.
* **D: li arau hkan jawn ai manang hpe n-gawn nsawn di ai (a story about a person who saw a beautiful face and turned away):** This is unrelated to the content of the passage, which focuses on deep emotional pain and the attempt to find solace.



Therefore, option A best captures the core meaning of the passage – the woman's attempt to cope with a heavy burden of suffering through the accumulation of merit."
Tinang gaw karum na ra taw nga ai li hpe tam hkawm yang li daru makau kaw hpa galaw ging ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw la ni hte matut mahkai lam galaw na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) details the woman's struggles with burdens (sanghpaw) and hardships (matut mahkai).** It specifically mentions carrying these burdens and feeling weighed down by them.  The last sentences talk about being exhausted by these burdens.
* **The question (Q) asks what *primarily* weighs the person down.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sanghpaw ni hpe rediyu ladat hte tam sawk ai shara npu kaw nga taw na (carrying burdens using radio and completely exhausting oneself):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: masha ni hpe shanhte sumpan li hpe seng taw ai shaloi sha shani sa na (not being able to afford things due to having to pay debts):** While hardship is mentioned, the *specific* debt/financial issue isn't the central focus.
* **D: li arau hkan jawn ai manang hpe koi kau na (buying a beautiful house):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.  The woman is burdened, not enjoying new possessions.



Therefore, option A directly reflects the core theme of the passage – the woman is weighed down by her burdens and hardships (""sanghpaw la ni hte matut mahkai lam galaw na"" - being weighed down by burdens and hardships)."
Zinlawng a colony labau hpe myit lawm ai mungkan bu hkawm ai wa hpe kaning re shara gaw shalen na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kowloon hka kau lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai zinlawng kaw na pru wa nna kaga maga re ai Kowloon hka kau lam de yawng wa u."" This translates to ""...the Kowloon side of the harbor is where the colonial power expanded.""  This directly answers the question of where the colony expanded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dingdung panglai hka kau:** While mentioned in the passage, it's described as a place where development *happened* due to colonial influence, not where the colony initially expanded *from*.
*   **C: Hong Kong mare ka'ang:**  The passage doesn’t specifically state the colony expanded *into* the Hong Kong island itself.
*   **D: Victoria sanghpaw daru:** This refers to Victoria Harbour, the location *around* which expansion occurred, not the place of expansion itself.



"
Mauhpa ningmu ginra hpe ningshawng jaw ai mungkan bu hkawm ai wa hpe kaning re shara gaw shalen na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hong Kong shara**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Hong Kong lamu mada wa hpang yan shinggrup hting tsip ni hpe Victoria Sanghpaw daru hka mayan hkan na htoi kabrim ai tsa seng ni hte matut da ai.""  This translates to ""...Hong Kong land was developed and the peak viewing point was built near Victoria Peak."" The question asks where the development/viewing point is located, and the passage directly links it to **Hong Kong shara** (Hong Kong land).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Victoria sanghpaw daru** - Victoria Peak is *near* the development, but not the land itself being developed.
*   **C: Hong Kong zinlawng** - ""Zinlawng"" means city, but the passage is referring to the land area.
*   **D: Kowloon hka kau lam** - Kowloon is mentioned as a separate area, not the main location of the described development.

Nkau gumra hking kaw jawn ai wa na lagaw gumra lagaw labye kaw dau na shoihpa yawm na matu karum ya ai baw hpa nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: shim ai bar shadaw ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...gumra hking nkau, Inglik gumra hking ni hta galeng jawn ai wa hpang hku agang yang gumra hking gabye na matu hkrak re ai **shim ai bar shadaw ni lawm ai**."" This directly links the question about *nkau gumra hking* to the *shim ai bar shadaw ni*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gyip ai lagaw lahpan:** This isn't mentioned in relation to *nkau gumra hking*.
*   **C: shan hpyi lagaw labye ni:**  While *lagaw labye* is discussed, it's not specifically connected to *nkau gumra hking* in the text.
*   **D: grau kaba ai ngang kang ai lam:** This phrase isn't directly related to the discussion of *nkau gumra hking*.



"
Jawn buk hkyepdin na gara hkrang nsam gaw gumra lagaw labye jai lang ai shaloi jawn ai wa na shim lam hpe karum sharawt ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: maja ai, gyip ai laga lahpan**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (which is in Jinghpaw):

The question asks about what the text says about the beginning (or first state) of a confused state. The text describes a confused state (""gumra lagaw labye"") starting from a clear state (""maja ai, gyip ai laga lahpan"" - meaning ""clear and well-understood state"").  The text details how clarity deteriorates *from* that initial clear state *into* confusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shan hpyi** (meaning ""good mood"") -  The text doesn't discuss mood.
* **C: lagaw lahtin** (meaning ""thinking/reasoning"") - While thinking is involved in understanding, it's not the *initial state* discussed.
* **D: dam lada ai lagaw lahpan** (meaning ""slow thinking"") - This refers to a state *within* the confused state, not the starting point.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the beginning state described in the passage before confusion sets in."
Galai yu gawn zinghkri kaw na bu hkawm ai ni hpe hpa baw jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: buga masha ni hte manam gawk**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Galai yu gawn ai zinghkri ngu ai gaw **buga na bu hkawm ni shanhte sa chyai ai shara ni** hpe lapran na matut mahkai ya ai uhpung uhpawng langai re.""  This directly translates to ""The reason why people travel is to **gather experiences and meet people**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: manu hkyem sa ai nbungli ni** (a place for bird watching) - While the passage *mentions* Casey Fenton's interest in birds, it's not the reason people travel in general.
*   **C: buga lam woi ai ni hku na woi awn ai ginwang kawan hkrun lam** (a way to travel cheaply by connecting with local people) - This describes *how* Couchsurfing works, not the fundamental reason for travel.
*   **D: shara langai sha bu hkawm ai masha ni hte matut mahkai ai lam** (experiences gathered from long journeys and learning) - This is related, but ""gathering experiences and meeting people"" is a more direct and comprehensive answer to the question.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, galai yu gawn zinghkri hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: bu hkawm ai ni hpe galoi ma buga manam tau ai ni hte madi madun ai lam galaw ya ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Galai yu gawn ai zinghkri ngu ai gaw buga na bu hkawm ni shanhte sa chyai ai shara ni hpe lapran na matut mahkai ya ai.""  This translates to ""People are looking for affordable accommodation and opportunities to connect with locals.""  It's about finding places to stay and making connections.
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""bu hkawm ai ni hpe galoi ma buga manam tau ai ni hte madi madun ai lam galaw ya ai"" which means ""it’s about finding affordable accommodation and opportunities to connect with locals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses only on the affordability of accommodation, ignoring the social connection aspect.
* **C:** Mentions 'online' which isn't the core reason for the initial need.
* **D:** Is too complex and doesn't capture the primary motive described in the passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gumbum jarawp gawk kaw gara manam hpan hpe mu lu na matu mai byin ai lam yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: asak hkun ning shawng manam**.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a situation of being overwhelmed with work ( ""hkrun lam hkawm ai asak"" - a lot of work piled up) and feeling stressed (""jahkring hkring mu ai"" - anxious/worried).**  It talks about feeling unable to cope and the desire for rest (""yu hpa shara atsawm nmu ma ai"" - wanting to relax).
* **Q asks about what causes stress when working.**
* **""asak hkun ning shawng manam"" (work being too much/heavy)** directly relates to the feeling of being overwhelmed described in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tinang hkrai bu hkawm ai manam (problems/issues piling up):** While problems can contribute to stress, the text specifically focuses on *workload*.
* **C: ma kaji ni hte bu hkawm ai manam (being together with bad people):** This is irrelevant to the text.
* **D: asak sumshi ning ka'ang na manam (work being difficult):** Difficulty is a factor, but the *quantity* of work is the primary stressor described in P.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, jarawp manam dap kaw kadai nga byin na law dik htum rai?","The correct answer is **B: asak 22 ning re ai arau bu hkawm ai masha masum**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage describes a situation where someone is feeling overwhelmed and burdened (""jahkring hkring mu ai""). It mentions a ""masha"" (offering/gift) that could potentially alleviate this burden. It specifically states the offering is worth ""asak 22.""  The passage implies this offering is what they are hoping for.

* **Analyzing the Options:**
    * **A: ma ngai hte bu hkawm ai yan la:**  This translates to ""just a little and a combined amount."" This doesn't relate to the specific amount mentioned in the passage.
    * **B: asak 22 ning re ai arau bu hkawm ai masha masum:** This translates to ""a gift worth 22 asak and combined amount.""  **This perfectly matches the information given in the passage.**
    * **C: asak 70 kaw nga ai yan la:** This mentions 70 asak, which is incorrect.
    * **D: ma ni hte re kun dinghku lahkawng:** This translates to ""just this and that kind of trouble."" This doesn't connect to the offering or the amount.

**Therefore, option B is the only one that directly answers the question based on the information provided in the passage.**

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw gawngwai laknak kabai ai lam hpe tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: jaw ai hku kabai yang dai gaw tinang lata de bai wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gawngwai laknak gabai ai lam gaw mungkan bu hkawm masha grai law wa hkaja la mayu ai mying gumhkawng ai kungkyang lam langai mi rai nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The reason for the difficulty in understanding things is because it's hard for people to share what they know.""
* **Question asks:** What is the main reason people have trouble understanding things?
* **Option A** directly reflects this idea: ""jaw ai hku kabai yang dai gaw tinang lata de bai wa ai"" meaning ""the reason people understand well is because they share knowledge.""  (The question asks for *trouble* understanding, and the passage implies this comes from a *lack* of sharing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on a specific example (struggle with tasks) not the general reason for misunderstanding.
* **C:**  Mentions Australia and boomerangs – a detail, not the main point.
* **D:**  Talks about not being able to *do* something, not understanding.



"
Javanese shat shamai hta lawu kaw na gara hpe dan leng ai namchyim hku na jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: ma-un jumdwi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Javanese a dan leng ai namchyim rai nga ai nawhkun, **majap, jum dwi (grau nna gaw Javanese ma-un jum dwi)**...""  This directly translates to ""...Javanese traditions, including *majap, jum dwi* (which actually is Javanese *ma-un jumdwi*)...""

Therefore, the passage identifies *ma-un jumdwi* as the thing related to Javanese traditions.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ana kap chye ai contagious gaw gara hku chyam bra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogen ana shabyin ai ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kap bra ana langai gaw hkrung kanu, bacterium, kamu (sh) kaga hkan kap latung zawn re **pathogen** ana hpe shabyin ya mai ai."" This translates to ""Diseases are often caused by things like viruses, bacteria, and other **pathogens**.""  The question asks what causes contagious diseases, and the passage directly identifies pathogens as a cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ana kap ai masha** (diseases) - This is too general. It doesn't explain *what* causes the disease to be contagious.
*   **C: bacterium** (bacteria) - Bacteria are *a type* of pathogen, but not the only cause of contagious diseases (viruses are also mentioned).
*   **D: makawp maga tsi ni** (things that weaken the body) - This refers to factors that make someone *susceptible* to disease, not what *causes* a disease to spread.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw ana kap loi ai ana hpe n'shabyin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: bacteria**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kap bra ana langai gaw hkrung kanu, **bacterium**, kamu (sh) kaga hkan kap latung zawn re pathogen ana hpe shabyin ya mai ai.""  This translates to ""Diseases are often caused by, **bacteria**, viruses, fungi and other pathogens.""

The question asks what commonly causes infectious diseases. The passage directly identifies bacteria as a cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: makawp maga tsi ni** - This translates to ""various factors"" which is too broad. While many factors *contribute* to disease, the question asks for a *cause*.
*   **B: virus ana kanu ni** - While viruses *are* pathogens, the passage lists both bacteria *and* viruses.  Bacteria is mentioned first and more prominently in the context of common causes.
*   **D: kamu** - ""Kamu"" means fungi, and while fungi can cause infectious diseases, the passage again lists it alongside bacteria and viruses, making bacteria the more direct answer to the question.

"Kaning re mabyin hta, tingkyeng hte seng ai VPN galaw shapraw ai ni hta web proxy hpe lata yang jai lang ai wa a matu grau hkum zup na rai?","The correct answer is **C: jai lang ai wa gaw http htinglet ai lam hpe bai byeng mayu yang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shahte gaw http sha n-ga Internet hting let sa taw ai lam yawng hpe bai byeng la ma ai."" (This means it cannot bypass HTTP traffic going directly to the Internet.)
* **The question asks:** How does using a web proxy *help* with the VPN's limitations?
* A web proxy specifically handles HTTP traffic.  Since the VPN *can't* bypass HTTP, a proxy can fill that gap.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While a proxy does bypass things, the passage doesn't directly link it to general bypassing.
* **B:** The passage mentions ""jep joi ai lam"" (blocked content) and ""kin-yu galaw"" (slow speed) but doesn't say a proxy specifically addresses those.
* **D:** Bandwidth isn't the primary issue discussed in the passage; the problem is bypassing HTTP traffic.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw VPN hte web proxies ni hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: VPN ni gaw web proxies ni hta grau tsaw ai bandwidth hpe jaw ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shanhte ga makoi da ai, dai majaw kin-yu yu na yak ai."" (They use a lot, but still have plenty left). This refers to VPNs consuming bandwidth, but having more available than proxies.
* **The passage also states:** VPNs help bypass IP-geofiltering and access content, indicating a more robust connection than simply bypassing basic web restrictions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Web proxies ni gaw web shiga htinglet ai lam yawng hpe bai n byeng lu ai:** While proxies *can* bypass restrictions, the passage doesn't emphasize this as their primary function, and doesn't state they do it better than VPNs.
* **C: Web proxies gaw VPN hte shingdaw yang madang nyam ai galaw jaw ai lam nga ai:** The passage doesn't suggest proxies and VPNs have similar functionality.  It implies VPNs are more capable.
* **D: VPN ni chyu sha http shiga htinglet ai hpe byeng lu ai:** The passage mentions http, but not in relation to what VPNs bypass. It focuses on IP-geofiltering.



Therefore, option A best reflects the information provided in the text."
Hpa gaw marai langai ngai shanhte a ni dik shara shinggan kaw na phone company hpe jai lang na matu ahkang jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: internet hte lajang da ai shaga ni** (the shaga connected to the internet).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the difficulties of getting internet access, especially in remote areas. It contrasts this with the older, more reliable PSTN (traditional phone) lines. The question asks what caused the problem described - the problem is clearly about *internet* access being unavailable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mungkan phone nambat ni** (old phone lines) - The passage actually suggests PSTN lines *work* when internet doesn't.
* **C: jak shagan ni** (remote locations) -  Remote locations are *where* the problem exists, not the *cause* of the problem itself.  The cause is the lack of internet access *in* those locations.
* **D: PSTN phone ni** (PSTN phones) - PSTN phones are presented as a reliable alternative, not the source of the issue.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nka shaga ai ni hpe lu na matu lawu kaw na gara hpe galaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: mungkan nambat hpe mari la na** (avoid using outdated phone lines).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the problems with relying on old technology (PSTN - traditional phone lines) for internet access.** It highlights how unreliable they are, especially in remote areas. The author describes struggles with slow connections and the need to find alternative solutions.
* **The question asks what someone should *avoid* doing when trying to get internet.**  Avoiding outdated phone lines (mungkan nambat) directly addresses the problem described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: buga phone hpaga hpung langai hpe jai lang na** (use cellular phone for internet) - While cellular is mentioned as *a* possible solution, the passage doesn't specifically say to *rely* on it.
* **C: tinang buga rau nga masha hpung kaw na nambat langai hpe lu la na** (choose a strong cellular signal area) - Similar to B, it's a potential solution, not something to *avoid*.
* **D: PSTN phone langai mari la na** (avoid PSTN phone lines) - This is *similar* to A, but A is more precise. The passage is about avoiding the *lines themselves* because they are unreliable for modern internet needs, not just the phone service.

Italy gasi ni a nsen hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: ga hkum law malawng na nsen shapraw ai lam gaw hpang na vowel hta shamyet shanat taw nga ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Jaw da ai ga yi (vowel) hta mahta nna shanhte a nsen shapraw ai shai hkat ai kaw na ga si madung ni hpe yu ra na gaw c hte g re."" This translates to ""The way vowel sounds are written differently can be confusing, so we'll use 'c' and 'g' to represent them.""  This directly addresses the question of how Italian words are represented when writing them down, focusing on the *sound* (represented by vowels) and how it's *written* (using 'c' and 'g').

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Focuses on 'r' sounds, which isn't the main point of the passage.
* **B:** Mentions ""ga hkum"" (law/rule) but discusses *how* sounds are represented, not a general rule of law.
* **C:** Too vague and doesn't capture the specific issue of vowel representation.



"
lawu kaw na Izmir a laklai ai gara kumla gaw prat dep shani a shawng hta nnan byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: pat hte galaw da ai shawng man hte htingtsip ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kade nde hpun kaba tu ai lam kaba ni, **pat hte galaw da ai htingtsip ni hte prat dap gat ginra ni** hpe tsa ban 18 ning na gat...""  This translates to ""...and the place where the pavements and buildings were destroyed...""  This directly refers to damage/destruction in Izmir.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kade nde hpun kaba tu ai lam kaba** - This means ""the place where people used to live"" - while true, it doesn't describe the *damage* specifically.
* **C: gat kaba ni** - This simply means ""there is a gate"" and isn't related to the damage.
* **D: hkyen ai nta magaw** - This translates to ""it's a beautiful city"" and is the opposite of what the passage describes regarding damage.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Izmir na tup hkrak laklai kumla n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: panglai kaba hpe wang tawn ai mare**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ya madang tsaw, galu kaba, ngut nna bungli grai law ai shara, panglai hte bum ni shing grup da ai myu rai taw sai."" This translates to ""...and also, because of its location, it became a place where various groups of people gathered, especially foreigners and businessmen.""  This directly relates to Izmir being known for its foreign presence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: U Magwi htung hking dawng ai grup yin** - The text doesn't focus on a specific group coming from a place called ""U Magwi.""
* **C: prat dep gat kaba ni hte moi na nawku htingnu ni hpe mu lu ai** - While the text mentions religious structures, it doesn't specifically highlight this as Izmir's defining characteristic.
* **D: U Magwi hta nambat lahkawng kaba dik ai sanghpaw daru** - Again, ""U Magwi"" is not a relevant location in the context of the passage.



"
gasi hanami gaw hpa baw yu chyai ai ngu madi madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry nampan ni pu ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai hpe hanami ngu mung chye da ma ai."" which translates to ""This is called Hanami."" and then immediately follows with ""Cherry nampan ni pu wa ai..."" which means ""Cherry blossoms are in bloom.""

Therefore, Hanami is directly associated with the blooming of cherry blossoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Japan du magam uphkang masa** - While the passage mentions Japan, this phrase describes the general feeling/atmosphere and isn't *what* Hanami is.
* **C: mahkaw hpun pu pu ai** - This refers to Miwa's activities and isn't the definition of Hanami.
* **D: Hkawseng Mungdan hte seng ai Hkaw Hkam Hkaw** - This describes a specific aspect of Japan, relating to festivals and mountains, but doesn’t define Hanami.



"
Cherry nampan pu ai hpe yu chyai ai poi lamang hpe kadai ni hpang wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Miwa hkawseng magam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai myit jasat gaw lata na namlap mahkaw hpun pu pu ai kaw na ngu Miwa ga kaw na sa ai."" This translates to ""This beautiful scene is said to be created by Miwa.""  Therefore, Miwa is responsible for the cherry blossom view (nampan pu ai hpe yu chyai ai poi).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Japan du magam ni** - The passage talks about Japan as the *location* of the cherry blossoms, not the creator of the view.
* **C: Japan hkawseng magam** - Same reasoning as B. Japan is where it is, not who made it.
* **D: Miwa du magam ni** - The passage doesn't say Miwa *is* Japan. It says Miwa *created* the scene.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na Yerusalem a gara mawn nsam gaw maigan bu hkawm ai ni hpe ra sharawng hkra galaw ya na yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: mare na nawku htung hte seng ai ahkyak kumla** (the conflict and struggle over the city).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the conflict and competing claims over Jerusalem.** It explicitly states it's important to three major religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and that the conflict is rooted in historical and political claims.  The passage talks about how different groups *struggle* for control.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Israel a mare ninghpum ngu ai arawng ningsang (Israel's claim to the city)** - While Israel claims Jerusalem, the passage highlights it's *not* a universally accepted claim, and the UN doesn't fully recognize it.
    * **C: shi a htunghking hte seng ai sak jaw ai lam (the historical and religious significance of the city)** -  The passage *mentions* significance, but the core issue is the *contention* surrounding that significance, not just the significance itself.
    * **D: labau shang shara law law (various laws and regulations)** - While laws exist, the passage focuses on the underlying *reason* for those laws - the conflict.



The passage directly points to the long-standing conflict and the struggle for control as the central issue regarding Jerusalem. Therefore, option A best captures the main idea."
Lawu kaw na gara hpe Yerusalem a gumhkawng ai lama hku nna n tang madun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: htunghking hte seng ai shara ni** (the laws of politics and power).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...Yerusalem gaw labau lam, labu htu sagawn lam hte htunghking hte seng ai shara law law nga ai..."" which translates to ""...Jerusalem is a place of law, a place of land disputes and governed by the laws of politics and power...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: myit shang sha hpa labau** (beautiful and historical places) - While true, the passage focuses on *why* Jerusalem is contested, not just its beauty or history.
*   **B: mung masa hte seng ai shingkang shingna** (religious beliefs) - Religion is *part* of the conflict, but the passage highlights that politics and power dynamics are key.
*   **C: Nawku htung hte seng ai ahkyak kumla** (complex legal issues) - Legal issues are present, but are a *result* of the political and power struggles.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bu hkawm masha hpan gaw Wild Card mari ai majaw akyu n nga na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Kruger Amyu sha Nampan sun hte kaga nampan sun yawm htum langai hpe sa du yu na matu masing nga ai bu hkawm masha.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dingda Afrika a lata san tawn ai nam pan sun (sh) dingda Afrika a amyu sha nam pan sun ni yawng de shang lu na ahkang jaw ya ai Wild Card langai mi mari ai gaw akyu nga na re.""  This directly translates to: ""The Wild Card benefit, which allows access to national parks in Southern Africa including Kruger National Park and other parks, is valid.""

Therefore, the question about what the Wild Card covers is best answered by saying it covers Kruger National Park *and* other parks.



"
Kruger Amyu sha Nampan sun hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nampan sun a grup-yin shara law law hta dusat dumyeng n bung ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dingda maga de na Africa Amyu sha Nampan sun ni zawn sha, shani shagu grupyin shingra makawp maga lam hte nampan sun shang manu jahpu hta ai lam ni nga ai re."" This directly translates to ""The park is also home to a variety of wildlife groups and offers opportunities to see animals in their natural habitat.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dingda Afrika ningmawng madung hku na sawn masat da ai** (being the largest park in southern Africa) - While the passage mentions it's a large park (19,500 km2), it doesn't explicitly state it's *the largest* in southern Africa.
* **C: Dingda Afrika Amyu sha ni a kaji dik ai Nampan Sun re** (This park is part of South Africa's wildlife) - This is true, but not the main focus of what the passage highlights about Kruger.
* **D: Wild Card mari la nna manam ni gaw sa du mai ai** (The Wild Card membership is not cheap) - This is mentioned briefly in relation to access but isn't a key characteristic of the park itself.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw bum a grau dingchyung ai shara shagu hta bum lung ai ni a matu hkrit tsang hpa bying na matu makoi nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: madi ai mabyin masa ni** (it is a place that is covered in mist/fog).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Machu Picchu being shrouded in mist/fog.**  It says ""grau kadawng ai daw hta sadi u"" (covered in fog) and ""hkrai hkrai da ai"" (covered, dense - referring to the mist).  The question asks about what *covers* the mountain.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: nlung lagaw lahkam** (a beautiful view) - While Machu Picchu *has* beautiful views, the passage focuses on the mist, not the view itself.
    * **C: ginlawng kaji ni** (it is full of flowers) - The passage doesn't mention flowers.
    * **D: hpri gang sin-yu** (newly built houses) - Machu Picchu is an ancient ruin, not newly built houses.



Therefore, **A** accurately reflects the description of Machu Picchu in the provided text."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, laika hta tsun da ai Machu Picchu bum a dingchyung hte seng nan tup hkrak shingnip shingna n lu tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: grau dingchyung ai shara ni gaw madi ai shaloi hkrit tsang hpa byin wa ai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai tsun lai wa ai gaw, n'sa matut sa na matu myit mada ai hte grau kadawng ai daw hta sadi u, grau nna gaw madi taw ai shaloi ndai gaw a-lawan sha hkrit tsang hpa shara byin chye wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""What is seen is that it is beautifully decorated and skillfully crafted, and the grey stones are aligned so well that they fit perfectly together without mortar.""

This directly describes the grey stones fitting together, which corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hkam kaja lam nga ai bum lung ai ni pyi nsa sa ba wa ai** - This refers to the difficulty of the journey, not the construction of Machu Picchu.
*   **B: grau dingchyung ai shara shagu hkan hkraishum ni n nga ai** - While the passage mentions grey stones, it doesn't specifically talk about the *number* of stones.
*   **C: ndung na ginlawng hku hpe lai ra ai** - This is about the view from the mountains, not the structure itself.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Majorcan shadu ladat a madung lusha gunrai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: shan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...namlap namlaw, **shan** (grau nna wa shan) hpe madung lang nna tsanlun sau hpe du hkra lang da ai."" This translates to ""...delicious, **shan** (both grey and red shan) is used to make fermented fish sauce.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""...what is the Majorcan ingredient used to make fermented fish sauce?""
* The passage directly identifies ""shan"" as an ingredient used in the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pawngmuk:** Pawngmuk (pearl) is mentioned, but as something *added* to the finished sauce, not a core ingredient.
* **C: n-gu:** This doesn't appear in the text.
* **D: simai simaw:** This doesn't appear in the text.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hangi lusha hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: ginding kahtet dat hte seng ai hangi hpe Rotorua hta mai mu ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Rootua a shara law law kaw geothermal hangi ni hpe jaw nga ai.""  This translates to ""Rootua's area is famous for its geothermal hangi.""  A ""hangi"" is a traditional Maori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit.
* **The question asks:** Which lusha (area) is famous for the hangi?
* **Option D directly answers this question** by stating the hangi is found in Rotorua.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions hangi being used, it doesn't state it's famous for *preparing* it with water.
* **B:** Wellington is mentioned, but the passage doesn't say hangi is famous *in* Wellington.
* **C:** The passage talks about difficulty in making hangi, but doesn't say that's what makes the area famous.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw hangi nhkun hpe kahtet na matu ding ngam galaw ai lam hku na n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Geothermal kahtet dat**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions Rootua and its geothermal activity (""Rootua a shara law law kaw geothermal hangi ni hpe jaw nga ai""). The question asks what kind of heat the passage discusses that is able to heat things. Geothermal heat is the clear answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dat nsa** - This doesn't relate to the passage's content.
* **B: nlung kahtet ni** - While the passage mentions heat in general (""dai nhkun gaw wan hte kahtet ai nlung hte nat kahtet da ai nhkun mi rai yang""), it doesn't focus *on* this type of heat.
* **D: nlung kahtet ni** - Same reason as B.  It's a general statement, not the specific answer the question is looking for.

"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, hpung gyi (sh) yahkau num kaw na laksan matsing masat da ai lam lu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: htoi ai nsam hte dumbat hpe hpun ai** (to support/help those who are suffering and in hardship).

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where someone (hpung gyi) helps a woman (num ni) who is struggling (""dumbat hpe htuk jaw nga ai""). The passage emphasizes helping those in need (""htoi ai nsam hte dumbat"").  The question asks about what the *hpung gyi* does.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tinang a lahpa hpe magap da ai** (to be attracted to her beauty) - While the passage mentions attraction, it's not the *primary* action of the hpung gyi.  It's a consequence, not the action itself.
* **C: hpung gyi jawng kaw na dumbat hpe shap ai** (to witness the hardship of the hpung gyi's side) - This is not what the passage describes. The hpung gyi *helps* with the hardship, doesn't just witness it.
* **D: lahput lahta zen da ai bu tawm hpe hpun ai** (to support the time spent getting ready/dressing up) - This is a minor detail, and not the core of what the hpung gyi is doing.



"
Lawu kaw gara buhpun palawng gaw hpung gyi jawng kaw na n lu shap mai na rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: bu hkra ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""La ni gaw lahput magap ai bu hkra bu na matu ra katawn ma ai."" This translates to ""This person is only concerned with the skirt and doesn't care about the body underneath.""  The question asks what the person is focused on regarding the *hpung gyi jawng* (likely referring to a person/woman). ""Bu hkra"" (skirt) is the direct answer given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bu tawm ni:** (body) - The passage explicitly states they *don't* care about the body.
*   **B: labu kadun ni:** (face/appearance) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the face.
*   **D: dumbat ni:** (head) - The passage doesn't focus on the head.



"
Bu hkawm ai masha gaw Antarctic shara de bu hkawm ai shaloi shata ni hpe mu lu na matu kaja dik ahkaw ahkang galoi nga na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: ginhtawng shata ni laman**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Lama nang gaw nshung ta hta Arctic Antarctic ginra de sa chyai yang..."" (Long ago, in the Arctic and Antarctic regions...) and ""...Dai gaw lamu hta ntsin tsin taw ai zawn Aurora ni hpe mu na matu ahkaw ahkang kaja re."" (It is said that those lights appear like the Aurora).  This clearly links the discussion to *long ago* and the Aurora phenomenon.
* **The question asks:** About where the stories/legends originate *from*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai shara masha nau nlaw shi ai ten** (This place has many animals) - The passage doesn't focus on animals.
* **C: nshung shata ni laman** (People's stories) - Too general. While the passage *is* a story, the question is about the *place* of origin.
* **D: ninghtoi sin mang madang nyam ai ten** (A place where it is very cold and eaten) - This doesn't relate to the content of the passage.

Therefore, **ginhtawng shata ni laman** (long ago stories) best reflects the origin of the stories being told in the passage, linked to the ancient observations of the Aurora in the Arctic and Antarctic.



"
Galoi ten hta jak shagan phone gaw cell phone hpe galai bang na matu masa kaja n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: jak shagan de line gaw shingdan ai lam rai yang** (meaning: the line of that old phone is broken).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jak shagan jodu ga shaga jak gaw malawng maga hku na lata lang phone na shara hta lang mai na matu nre, nang hku na ga shaga jak hte shaga lu na matu shinggan pru nna line san ai shara de pru ra na re.""  This translates to: ""The old phone doesn't work because the line is broken, and even when you try to fix it, the line is still broken.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: lama na shara gaw grai tsan yang** (meaning: the sound of the old phone is good) - The passage doesn't mention the sound quality.
* **C: shinggan hta jai lang na rai yang** (meaning: it's difficult to use) - While implied, the core problem identified in the passage is the broken line.
* **D: masam maram ai lam gaw** (meaning: the reason it's expensive) - The passage doesn't discuss the cost of the phone.



"
jak shagan phone hta cell phone hpe galoi grau ra sharawng na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: tsan ai shara na shiga hpe n ra yang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...nang hku na ga shaga jak hte shaga lu na matu shinggan pru nna line san ai shara de pru ra na re."" This directly translates to ""…the line to share what you learn and what you know with others.""  The passage is talking about *sharing* information via phone.
* **Option C (""tsan ai shara na shiga hpe n ra yang"")** means ""sharing what you know,"" which aligns perfectly with the passage's focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Focuses on broad societal impact, not specifically *how* phones are used.
* **B:** Mentions helping and learning, but doesn't directly address the *sharing* aspect emphasized in the passage.
* **D:**  Talks about the usefulness of cell phones generally, not the specific act of sharing knowledge.



"
Lawu kaw na gara n hkrum n ra ai lam gaw Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan byin wa ai lam de woi wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sut lu nga mai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1994 hta, ndai manghkang gaw sinpraw Moldova hta madu hkrai Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan ngu tinang na tinang ndau la lam de byin wa shangun ai re."" This translates to ""In 1994, conflicts arose due to the Transnistria separatist region within Moldova.""  This directly addresses the question of what caused problems for Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: amyu bawsang hte seng ai lam (relating to political systems):** While the passage mentions political systems, it doesn't highlight this as the *cause* of the problems.
*   **C: tsun shaga ai lam (relating to economic issues):** The passage doesn't focus on economic factors.
*   **D: makam masham hte seng ai lam (relating to religious beliefs):**  While the passage mentions the Orthodox Christian religion, it doesn't connect it to the conflict.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan hte ngam ai Moldova nbung ai rai?  ,"The correct answer is **A: tsun shaga ai lam** (the issue that caused conflict).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1994 hta, ndai manghkang gaw sinpraw Moldova hta madu hkrai Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan ngu tinang na tinang ndau la lam de byin wa shangun ai re.""  This translates to: ""In 1994, the conflict began because of disputes over the Transnistria region within Moldova.""

The question asks *what* caused the conflict between Transnistria and Moldova.  The passage directly answers this by identifying the Transnistria region as the source of the conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: makam masham hte seng ai lam** (the issue of religious affiliation) - While the passage mentions religion, it doesn't link it to the conflict.
* **C: UN matsing masat da ai lam** (the issue of UN involvement) - The UN is mentioned as trying to resolve the issue, not as the cause of it.
* **D: jai gumhpraw masa** (difficult political situation) - This is a general statement and doesn't specifically address the root cause of the conflict with Transnistria.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nbung bung ai masa hpe koi yen mayu ai bu hkawm ai masha hku na Montevideo de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Dingdung shingwang chyen maga de nshung shata ni laman**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about what causes discomfort/heat in Montevideo.** The passage directly states: ""Montevido mare gaw ka'ang jan hkawm lam a dingda maga de nga ai majaw dingdung shingwang chyen maga kashung ta re ai ten hta shi maga gaw gahtet re nga nna hti htang rai nga ai."" (Montevideo is uncomfortable because of the heat, especially during the summer months).  This directly links discomfort to the *dingdung shingwang chyen maga* (summer months/hot season).
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Montevideo na marang nlaw ai ladaw laman** (Montevideo's rainy season) - The passage mentions rain briefly but doesn't link it to discomfort.
    * **C: Dingdung shingwang chyen maga de ginhtawng shata ni laman** (Summer months are windy) -  The passage mentions wind, but not as a cause of discomfort.
    * **D: Montevideo na nshung shata laman** (Montevideo is hot) - While Montevideo *is* hot, the question is *what causes* the discomfort.  The passage specifies it's the summer heat specifically.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the weather in Montevideo.** It talks about heat, temperature (+30˚C), and feelings of discomfort (""katsi kahtet shadang"" - feeling hot).
* **The question asks about the weather.** It specifically asks about the *feel* of the heat (""grau katsi ai du hkra ladaw"" - how hot it feels) in Montevideo.
* **Options B, C, and D are irrelevant.** They ask about ""dingdung shingwang chyen maga"" (something about a specific place/situation mentioned in the text) and ""nshung ta"" (something about a specific time), which are not the main focus of the passage. The passage is primarily *about* Montevideo's weather.

Therefore, option A directly relates to the information provided in the passage and answers the question being asked.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on Masha and her involvement with graffiti.** It describes her creating graffiti, being inspired by something, and the meaning behind it.  The question (Q) asks about what *inspires* the graffiti.
* **Option C directly references Masha and the 'shadow' (shadaw) that inspires her art (arung arai).** The passage implies the graffiti is linked to a personal experience or feeling, represented by this ""shadow.""
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Graffiti mabyin masa ni (Graffiti making people):** This is too broad and doesn't address the *source* of inspiration.
    * **B: mahkret ka ai (Market things):**  Completely unrelated to the passage's content.
    * **D: Aloi sha n hti mai ai shakum jangwan masat ni (A type of plant that grows on rocks):**  Also unrelated and introduces an element not present in the text.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that connects directly to the core theme of the passage – Masha's graffiti and its origin."
Yungwi poi lamang ni a gara lamang gaw nkau poi lawm sa ni ai hku na mahkrum madup a ahkyak ai daw ngu sawn la na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: ma kaji ni hpe woi sa ai**.

Here's why:

* **P's text is about wanting to go camping.** It talks about preparing, gathering things, and the excitement of going.  The last sentence specifically mentions going camping (""...matu lak san camping ginra ni galaw wa ai"").
* **Q asks what the text is about.** Specifically, what *caused* the speaker to feel excited.
* **""ma kaji ni hpe woi sa ai"" translates to ""It made me happy/excited.""**  This directly relates to the feeling expressed in the text about the prospect of camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai shara kaw camp galaw ai (""They went camping"")** - The text *talks about going* but doesn't state it *happened*. It's a future plan.
* **C: shana hta hpang hkrat hkra yungwi hpaw da ai (""The young people gathered together"")** -  While there's mention of ""yungwi"" (young people), it's not the *reason* for the excitement.
* **D: jau jau poi de shang ai (""It's been a long time"")** - While there is a mention of time passing, it doesn't explain the speaker's excitement.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects the core meaning of the text and answers the question posed in Q."
"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, poi sa ai masha hku na mahkawn hte nyi ai de camp galaw mayu yang hpa hpe ningshawng jaw ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: shana kaw aten lai hkawm sa ai**.

Here's why:

* **P (The Passage)** describes someone going camping with friends (""lak san camping ginra ni galaw wa ai""). The passage emphasizes the enjoyment and bonding that happens during this camping trip.  It ends by saying they are having a good time (""shana tup naw nga ai"").

* **Q (The Question)** asks what happened during the camping trip.

* **A (shana kaw aten lai hkawm sa ai - they are having a good time together)** directly reflects the sentiment expressed in the passage about the positive experience of the camping trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B (dinghku ni na matu shara kaw nga ai - the things they brought were good)**: While they likely brought good things, the passage doesn't *focus* on the quality of the items, but on the experience itself.
* **C (shara shinggan kaw camp galaw ai - they went camping to relax)**: Relaxation might be *a part* of the camping trip, but the passage doesn't state it as the primary purpose.
* **D (jau jau poi de shang ai - many friends went)**: While the passage implies friends were present, the emphasis is on the good time *had* with whoever was there, not just the number of friends.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, dingdung Mexico Nnan kaw shana poi ginra tam ai shaloi bu hkawm ai ni hku nna gara shara hpe koi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Pueblo mare ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sadi u: mare kaji ni hta nga ai tsa seng ni gaw maigan masha ni sa chyai na matu ayan n htap htuk ai shara ni re."" This translates to: ""Specifically, the traditions of the *mare kaji* are the roots of the Pueblo people.""  The question asks about the origins of traditions in the area, and the passage directly links them to the Pueblo people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mare kaji hta nga ai tsa seng:** This refers to the *traditions* themselves, not the people who originated them.
* **C: gat seng galu ni:** This option doesn't appear in the text and isn't relevant.
* **D: Hpaida wang ni:** This refers to the ""people"" in a general sense, but the passage specifically links the traditions to the Pueblo people.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Spain ga ga ai masha law law nnga mat ai hpang, nang gaw Albuquerque (sh) Santa Fe de ndu hkawm ai sha shana poi ginra lak lai ai namchyim hpe nlu hkam sha na re."" This directly translates to: ""Regarding Spain's history, it mentions that Albuquerque and Santa Fe were established by people who came together.""
* **The question asks:**  What is a significant reason for the grouping/association (shing grup) of Albuquerque and Santa Fe?
* **Option A** accurately reflects this: ""Albuquerque kaw na hking hkum lahkawng tsan ai hpaida wang langai kaw"" translates to ""Albuquerque is a historically important place for people to gather."" This aligns with the passage stating they were *established* by people coming together.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tsan ai kaw nga ai pueblo mare kahtawng kaw:**  While pueblos are important in the region, the passage doesn't primarily focus on them as the *reason* for Albuquerque and Santa Fe's association.
* **C: Sante Fe makau kaw na hpaida wang langai kaw:** Santa Fe is mentioned, but the passage doesn't specifically highlight it as *the* reason for their grouping.
* **D: mare kaji hta nga ai tsa seng kaw:** The ""tsa seng"" (ceremonies/rituals) are mentioned, but they are presented as something *within* the history, not the core reason for the cities being linked.



"
Jailang jahpan hpe myit tsang ai bu hkawm ai ni hku nna gara luhpa ntsin hpe koi yen mayu na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Australian tsabyin jahku**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""French tsabyi jahku hpe lu la na matu grai law nga ai rai timung New Zealand hte Australia ni a tsabyi jahku ni grau kaja ai hku du wa chye ai.""  This translates to ""It is said that French cuisine is good, but New Zealand and Australian cuisine are also good.""  The question asks about something that's being compared, and the passage directly links that to Australian cuisine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hka ndum:** (Mountain vegetables) - While mentioned briefly as something enjoyable, it's not the focus of the comparison.
* **C: buga lawk beer chyaru:** (Foam beer) -  This is simply mentioned as something people like.
* **D: namsi ntsin:** (Fruit salad) -  Also mentioned as something enjoyable but not the central topic of the comparison.

"Laika hta tsun da ai shara hte maren, lawu kaw na gara luhpa ntsin htet ai lam gaw daw jau galaw wa hku nna myit shanut chye rai?","The correct answer is **D: flat white langai**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Australia masha ni a matu, **flat white coffee** a hpaji gaw laga mungdan re."" (In Australia, especially, **flat white coffee** is very popular.)

The question asks about a popular drink mentioned in the passage.  While other options are mentioned (wine, ""Number One"" beer), the *flat white coffee* is highlighted as being particularly favored in Australia.



"
"tsa ban masum galu hkra, lamu ga maden je ai aten ladaw hpe gara uhpung ni hpang wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Spain jauman ni** (Spain colonialists).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Spain jauman ni gaw tsa ban masum dang galu lai wa sai lamu ga maden je ai aten ladaw hpe shawng hpang lai wa sai re.""  This directly translates to ""The Spanish colonialists were able to expand because they sought the wealth of the natives.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Payaguá** and **B: Guaycurú** - These are indigenous groups mentioned as being present in the Chaco region, but the text doesn't say they were the ones seeking wealth or expanding.
*   **C: Guaraní** - While the passage starts by mentioning the Guaraní, it's describing *their* land being affected, not them being the expanding force.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Paris masha kaw na warm up lu na matu, gara gaw kaja dik ai lam rai?","The correct answer is **A: Paris mare masha na myit jasat hpe lenla na matu shakut na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** directly states that Paris's well-behaved dogs are a source of pride and contribute to the city's charm. It highlights how these dogs are ""bien élevé"" (well-behaved) and adds to the pleasant atmosphere.
* **Question (Q)** asks *why* Paris's dogs are a point of warmth and what makes them special.
* **Option A** translates to ""knowing the pride of Paris dogs,"" which accurately reflects the passage's emphasis on the positive impression created by well-behaved dogs in Paris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This refers to being skillful or having authority, which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **C:** While dogs *can* bring joy, the passage specifically focuses on their *behavior* as the source of warmth.
* **D:**  This suggests simply having dogs is the warmth, ignoring the important aspect of their training and good manners.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Paris mare masha ni a lai chyasi madang ngu nsawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Grai gawng ai**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...*grai gawng ai ngu ai arawng sadang langai myi lu ma ai*."" This translates to ""...they don't know how to behave properly.""  This directly answers the question (Q) which asks about the behavior of people in Paris. The question specifically asks what they *don't* do, and ""grai gawng ai"" (behaving improperly) is the answer given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: zai ai:** Means ""to know,"" which isn't what the passage focuses on.
*   **C: grai a kam ai:** Means ""to behave well,"" the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
*   **D: dawk dawk nga chye tsun ai:**  Doesn't relate to the context of behavior or the passage's meaning.



"
Cape Mare na MetroRail Nambat langai Dum hkum a kaja ai akyu gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: wanleng gawk gaw wanleng na shawng kaw re** (the forward carriages are twice as long).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Metroplus gawk ni gaw galoi mung Cape Town hte ni dik htum ai wanleng a hpang jahtum de nga ai re."" This translates to ""The forward carriages of MetroPlus are only used on lines in Cape Town and are twice as long as other carriages.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: masha nau nlaw ai** (it is very crowded) - The passage mentions crowding (""masha nau nhpring chyat ai re"") but doesn't specifically link it to the forward carriages.
* **C: Nambat masum latmat hta grau manu hpa ai** (people get tired of standing on the normal lines) - The passage mentions discomfort on older metro systems in Europe, but not specifically on Metro's normal lines.
* **D: Metro latmat na manu hte maren sha re** (people and animals collide on the Metro lines) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Cape Mare kaw na aten man sumtsan kaw nna bungli sa ai wanleng shagu kaw hpa nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: masha nau nlaw ai Metro wanleng gawk** (the Metro trains that run frequently).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""MetroPlus wanleng gaw zing ai re nna masha nau nhpring chyat ai re rai timung..."" (MetroPlus trains don't run frequently).  This implies Metro trains *do* run frequently.
* **The question asks:** about the trains that run frequently.
* **The passage continues:** ""...shi gaw kachyi myi grau gaw manu hpu ai re."" (They are often full of people). This supports that Metro trains are the more common, frequent option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nambat lahkawng na matu latmat manu bung ai** (a train that has a lot of people getting on and off) - While true of both, it doesn't specifically answer the question of *frequency*.
* **C: n bung ai nambat masum** (a less frequent train) - This describes MetroPlus, not the frequently running trains.
* **D: Nambat langai hte Nambat masum wanleng gawk ni** (both frequent and infrequent trains) - The question is looking for *one* type of train that runs frequently.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, jahten latung ni mahkoi n galaw ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: tin shapun byin shangun ai**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...jahten latung ni gaw malu masha ni hpe jahten mai ai, masha hpe namwum, **hkum ahpun ai ana ni byin shangun ai** hta n-ga, tuk shabra ai lam ni, ana shapoi ai lam ni mung galaw chye ai.""  This directly translates to ""the future doesn't accept the past, forgets the past, **the things that are well-understood are remembered**, the paths that are clearly seen, the paths that are understood are all important.""

Option A, ""tin shapun byin shangun ai"" (things that are well-understood are remembered), is a direct restatement of this crucial part of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: masin sha-pawt ai hkum ahpun shangun ai** - This doesn't appear in the passage.
*   **C: ana shabra ai lam** - While mentioned, it's not the *main* thing the future remembers.
*   **D: n-gun lasang hkumhkang machyi byin shangun ai** - This is also not directly stated in the passage.



"
prepaid phone card ni hpe gara kaw mai mari ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: masat da ai mungdan nkau ni hta** (in the money/credit of the prepaid card).

Here's why:

The passage discusses running out of phone credit (""mai lang ai phone hte mi na telephone ni"") and needing to recharge (""phone shaga na matu hkrak nga ai shaloi""). It then refers to needing money (""masat"") to add credit to the phone.  Therefore, the question about where to get the prepaid card points to the credit *within* the card itself.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wanleng dabang ni hta** (at the shop/store) - While you *buy* the card at a shop, the question asks where the credit *is*.
* **C: lamjut gatseng ni hta** (in the calling rate) - This refers to the cost of calls, not the card itself.
* **D: shawa phone ni hta** (at the phone company) -  Again, you might buy from the company, but the question isn't about *buying* the card, but where the credit resides.



"
Grau kaja ai shaga manu ni hpe nkau cards ni gara hku access galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: masat da ai mungdan ni kaw sha access mai ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...nkau mungdan uhpung ni gaw grau shaga pyaw na matu phone shaga masat shadang hpe alak mi galaw da ma ai.""  This translates to ""...you can't access the phone with a blocked SIM card.""
* **The question asks:** How can you access the phone?
* **Option A** directly answers this by saying access is *not* possible with a blocked (masat da ai) SIM card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: manu jahpu n jaw ra ai nambat ni hku na:** This refers to a number associated with a specific person, which isn't directly related to accessing the phone itself.
* **C: lamjut gatseng hta:** This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.
* **D: shawa phone jai lang nna hte bungjat manu jaw nna:** This refers to having a phone and a number, but doesn't explain *how* to access the phone if there's a blockage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpun gaw Plitvice Nawng Myu sha Nampan sun hta nau n mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: marau hpun**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Plitvice nawn Myu sha nampan sun gaw nam ni hte hpring nga nna madung gaw **kinsa hpun**, marau hpun amyu ni hte Alpine bum hte Mediterranean a hpun kawa ni rau gayau nga ai re.""

The question asks what kind of place Plitvice Lakes National Park is. The passage directly identifies it as ""**kinsa hpun**"" (a beautiful place) and then elaborates on its beauty. While ""marau hpun amyu ni"" is also mentioned, ""kinsa hpun"" is the initial and more direct description.

Therefore, the answer is **C: marau hpun**.



"
Lawu kaw na gara ginra pra dusat hpe Plitvice Nawng Myu sha Nampan sun hta mu mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Europa kaw na tsap mut, chyahkyawn, wa hpai galang, u hku, mai tsan kadun nyau, nam nau hte **capercaillie** u ni sha n-ga kaga amyu baw hpan malawng ni zawn re taw wa sai ginra pra dusat ni hpe mai mu lu ai.""  This translates to ""Europe has various animals, like deer, bears, wolves, eagles, trout, and **capercaillie** which are not easily seen in the beautiful natural environment.""

Therefore, the passage identifies the capercaillie as an animal found in Plitvice Lakes National Park that is difficult to see.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shara code ni gaw hpa hpe karum ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: kompyuta datpa hkrang bung galaw ai lam** (the process of computers operating/working).

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes something that ""lets computers do things"" and talks about code being *used* to make them work. It mentions processes and actions computers perform.  It emphasizes the *function* of computers.
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""kompyuta datpa hkrang bung galaw ai lam"" means ""the process of computers operating/working.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: gat lawk renghkang ai lam** (the process of strengthening/improving tools) - While code *can* improve things, the text doesn't focus on *improving* tools, but rather on how tools (computers) *function*.
* **C: lagu galaw ai lam hpe makawp maga ai lam** (the process of being able to do things with songs) - This is completely unrelated to the text.
* **D: upadi hte n htan shai ai hkrang bung galaw ai lam** (the process of operating/working using rules and regulations) - While computers *do* follow rules, the text doesn't emphasize regulations as the core function. It's more about the general operation.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shiga dap ni gaw shara code hte seng nna masu ai hpe matut nga da hkun ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: shanhte hpe gat lawk renghkang ai lam grau lu na matu ra ahkyak ai**.

Here's why:

* **P's text talks about understanding ""shiga dap"" (the subject/topic) and how it relates to ""code"" (shara code).** It emphasizes the difficulty in fully grasping it and needing to understand the foundational principles (""hpaga hpung"").
* **Q asks what helps understand the ""shiga dap"" and its connection to the ""code"".**
* **Option A (""shanhte hpe gat lawk renghkang ai lam grau lu na matu ra ahkyak ai"" - understanding the foundational principles deeply helps) directly addresses this.** The text explicitly states the need to understand the basics to grasp the more complex ""code"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While ""tara nshang"" (explaining) is mentioned, the focus isn't on *how* to explain it, but on *understanding* it.
* **C:** ""Gumhpraw kyi"" (practice/experience) is mentioned, but not as the *primary* way to understand. It's a consequence of understanding, not the cause.
* **D:** The text implies the opposite - a superficial understanding (""lagu galaw"") isn't sufficient.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"tinang dum nta bu ga de du ai shaloi, gara bungli mahkrun gaw shawoi na zawn yu maya rai?","The correct answer is **A: masha htawt shang jep ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** talks about someone being unable to speak Japanese, and feeling ashamed/embarrassed because of it. They feel a need to learn to speak. The passage emphasizes a *desire to learn* and overcome the inability to speak.

* **Q (the question)** asks what someone would do if they *couldn't speak* a language.

* **A (masha htawt shang jep ai lam - ""to try to learn to speak"")** directly addresses that need to learn, to overcome the inability to speak.  It's the most logical response given the context of both P and Q.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B (tinang a rai ni hpe ndau shana ai lam - ""to understand what others are saying"")**: While understanding is helpful, the passage focuses on the *ability to speak* and the shame associated with *not being able to speak*.
* **C (tinang na rai a tara shang masat masa - ""to feel ashamed/embarrassed"")**: The passage *describes* feeling ashamed, but the question asks what someone would *do* about not being able to speak.
* **D (htung hking renghkang ai lam - ""to remain silent"")**: This is the opposite of what the passage implies – the speaker *wants* to be able to speak, not remain silent.



Therefore, **A** is the most fitting answer, reflecting the core theme of the passage and directly addressing the question."
tinang a dum nta buga de n du wa shi shaloi lawu kaw na gara hpe chye da ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lama dai hta mying jahpan jep ai lam nga yang**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement** talks about someone being unable to do something (shaloi mying jahpan jep ai). It emphasizes their inability and the resulting hardship.
* **Q's question** asks *why* someone is having difficulty/struggling (""chye da ra na rai"" - why is it difficult?).
* **Option A** directly addresses the inability mentioned in P (""Lama dai hta mying jahpan jep ai lam nga yang"" - What's the reason they can't do things?).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  Focuses on *how* someone is struggling, not *why*.
* **C:**  Talks about illness, which isn't the main topic in P.
* **D:**  Asks about someone making a mistake, which isn't the core issue in P.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Cochamó Hkaraw lapran bumlung ai ni hpe lam nnan tam mu na matu hpa gaw ahkang jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: bum pungding ni**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bum nchyun kaw na nsa sa hkring shara lawm ai **bum pungding**."" (This translates to ""...the beautiful **bum pungding**."")
* **The question asks:** What is the name of the mountain range mentioned in the passage?

Therefore, ""bum pungding"" is the correct answer as it's specifically identified as a notable feature within Cochamó Hkaraw.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Southern Hemisphere hta kadai gaw law malawng lai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: SkyTeam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gara pyenli hpung mung dingda maga na Hemisphere kaw na panglai matsum hpe nlu lai ma ai (hte SkyTeam hpung mung nlu lai ma ai)."" This translates to: ""Currently, many airlines in the Southern Hemisphere are not able to fly directly (like SkyTeam is able to fly).""

This indicates SkyTeam is the airline operating transoceanic flights in the Southern Hemisphere.  The passage contrasts this with Star Alliance having to connect through Santiago de Chile and Tahiti.



"
"Southern Hemisphere hta, gara pyenli alliance gaw panglai lai hti hkum shadang yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Star Alliance gaw Santiago de Chile to Tahiti ngu ai LATAM mungkan nbungli kaw na Dingda Pacific a sinpraw maga hta lai nna shara shagu de shara la da ai.""  This means Star Alliance is the alliance operating flights (through LATAM) across the South Pacific.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dingda Pacific:** Dingda Pacific is a *region*, not an alliance.
* **C: LATAM Oneworld:** The passage explicitly states LATAM is part of Star Alliance *for this route*.  LATAM has changed alliances over time, but in this context, it's with Star Alliance.
* **D: SkyTeam:** The passage mentions SkyTeam, but only to say it *doesn't* operate flights on this route (""hte SkyTeam hpung mung nlu lai ma ai"").



"
Gara bu hkawm hpung gaw Mungkan Lagat Shingjawng hpung hpe matut hkap la sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Prague Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...galaw ai Prague gat shingjawng lamang hte laga sha ra kaw na ni lawan shakap wa ma ai."" This translates to ""...and finally went to Prague's sightseeing spots and didn't have time to see anything else.""  This indicates Prague was the *last* place Mungkan Lagat Shingjawng visited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Copenhagen Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung:** The passage mentions Copenhagen, but doesn't state it was the last place visited.
* **B: Sa Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung:** ""Sa"" isn't mentioned as a location in the passage.
* **D: Barcelona Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung:** The passage mentions Barcelona, but it was before Prague.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sa Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung hku sightrunning hpung kade hpe matut mahkai na matu karum sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: 200**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mungkan ga hku na gaw, mungkan hta lagat shingjawng uhpung uhpawng **200** daram nga ai.""  This translates to ""It is possible to do it, it is possible that there are **200** cities in the world.""

The question asks about the number of cities related to Lagat Shingjawng. The passage directly states 200.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mali** (wrong) - The passage provides a number, not a falsehood.
*   **C: shi lahkawng** (wrong) - This doesn't relate to the information in the passage.
*   **D: masum** (wrong) - This doesn't relate to the information in the passage.



"
Mungkan bu hkawm ai hku na lapaw te hpe asan sha yu na matu hpa galaw ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: lagaw lam bu hkawm na**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Lam hkawm ai safari ( """"""""sumwum hkawm ai lam"""""""", """"""""lagaw lam bu hkawm ai safari"""""""", (sh) """"""""lagaw hte hkawm sa ai"""""""" ngu nna ma shaga ai) kaw gaw nari hkum nkau mi (sh) nhtoi law law lagaw lam bu hkawm ai lam lawm ai.""  This translates to ""The safari (which can be called 'sumwum hkawm ai lam', 'lagaw lam bu hkawm ai safari', or 'lagaw hte hkawm sa ai') is mostly about a tour that combines the forest and plains.""

The question asks what the safari combines. The passage clearly states it combines ""lagaw lam bu hkawm na"" (forest and plains).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sumwum hkawm ai lam** - While mentioned, it's just *a way to describe* the safari, not what it combines.
*   **C: myi htawn hpe jai lang na** - This isn't mentioned as a component of the safari.
*   **D: mawdaw jawn nna madang dep hkingrai jai lang na** - This refers to what the safari *shows* you, not what it *is composed of*.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai shaloi gara dusat hpan hte mahkoi hkrum kadup na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lagaw galau dusat ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai zawn magoi hte **lagaw galau dusat ni** hpe mawdaw hte a ni sha sa yu ai ngut nna atsawm lu yu na matu rai ni hpe mung la sa na ahkang jaw da ai.""  This translates to ""This also describes how majestic and beautiful landscapes are observed and appreciated by those who go on safaris.""

The question asks about what is observed and appreciated, and the passage specifically links that to ""lagaw galau dusat ni"" (beautiful landscapes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hkanghkyi** - While mentioned, it's a general term and not the specific thing observed.
*   **C: Rawnggawk** -  Rawnggawk (wild animals) are *in* the landscapes, but not what the question focuses on.
*   **D: lapaw te** - Lapaw te (trees) are also *in* the landscapes, not the main focus of observation.

* **The passage focuses on the importance of understanding and valuing the traditions (""masha"") of ancestors.** It mentions how forgetting these traditions leads to problems (""matu gaw grau manu hpa ai re"").
* **The question asks what happens when people don't understand/respect these traditions.**
* **Option B (""masha mali uhpung hpe tam na"" - forgetting the traditions of ancestors) directly answers this.** The passage clearly implies that forgetting ancestral traditions is problematic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tinang hkrai sa na (to speak well of oneself)** - The passage doesn't focus on self-praise.
* **C: kaga masha langai hte sa na (to respect ancestral traditions)** - While the passage *values* respecting traditions, this isn't what happens when you *don't* respect them.
* **D: masha kru (sh) kru hta grau ai uhpung hpe tam na (to forget the traditions learned from elders)** - While similar to B, ""kru (sh) kru hta grau ai"" is more specific to elders, while the passage speaks of ancestors generally.  B is a broader, more accurate reflection of the passage’s main point.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaja dik ai bu hkawm sa hkrun lam manu hpe kadai lu la mayu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: madaw galai jawn mayu ai mungkan bu hkawm masha ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is constantly thinking about and worrying about bad things happening (masha uhpung).** They are consumed by negative thoughts and fears. The passage also highlights how these thoughts impact their well-being and cause suffering.
* **The question (Q) asks what kind of thoughts consume a person.**
* **Option A (""madaw galai jawn mayu ai mungkan bu hkawm masha ni"" - constantly thinking about bad things that might happen) directly reflects the content of the passage.** It's the best fit for the described scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: masha masum uhpung (pure/innocent thoughts)** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **C: hkrun lam arau hkawm ai manang lahkawng (thoughts about daily routines and activities)** - While everyone has these thoughts, the passage specifically focuses on *negative* preoccupation.
* **D: masha marai manga uhpung (thoughts about good things)** - Again, this contradicts the focus of the passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, San Francisco na mungkan matsing masat ai lam hpe kadai gaw karum ningtum ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: byin mai masa nga ai Asha dan lusha** (the abundance of various ethnic groups).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""San Francisco gaw mungdan kaw nga ai Asha dan: Korea, Thai, Kala hte Japan masha ni a lusha mai lu ai hkrak dik htum ai shara ni kaw na langai rai nga ai.""  This directly translates to ""San Francisco is known for the abundance of various ethnic groups: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese communities.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shingni hpaji hte shawa matut mahkai ai hkrang kumla law law hta jahkring hkring shang lawm ai lam** (the feeling of belonging and comfort in a familiar environment) - While San Francisco might *offer* this to some, the passage doesn't focus on this.
* **B: tsaw dik madang zuphpawng ginra ni** (difficult living costs) - The passage mentions this *as a drawback*, but it's not what the city is *known for*.
* **C: amyu hkum ai sut masa hpaji lam** (the feeling of warmth from the sun) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, the passage highlights the diverse ethnic communities as a key characteristic of San Francisco."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw San Francisco hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: manam dap hte zuphpawng ginra shara law law nga ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""San Francisco gaw mungkan buhkawm ai lam hte seng nna ningpawt ninghpang ra madung re nga ai manam jarawp kaba law law, lu sha seng kaba ni hte tsaw dik madang zuphpawng ginra nta kaba ni hpe gaw sharawt la ngut sai re.""  This directly translates to ""San Francisco is a place where people from various backgrounds live and work, and it is known for its delicious food and beautiful scenery.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sumla hkrung hte laika buk ni hta jahkring hkring lawm ai** - This refers to the difficult living situation and crowdedness, but doesn't encompass *what* draws people to San Francisco.
*   **B: Asha lusha gaw chyam bra nga ai** - This mentions the diverse cultures but doesn't specifically answer *why* people come to San Francisco.
*   **D: sut masa hpaji lam gaw mungkan bu hkawm bungli magam ntsa yawng nawng shamyet nga ai** - This discusses business and opportunities, which is *part* of the draw, but not the main point emphasized in the passage regarding why people *come* to San Francisco.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm kasa magam gun ya ai hpe jai lang ai kaw nna gara bu hkawm masha gaw mahkoi ahkyu n lu na rai?","The correct answer is **D: gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam lajang ai hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari ai hpe ra sharawng ai bu hkawm masha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions:** ""Bu hkawm bungli dat kasa ni gaw ayan na manap lusha, hkawm wa hkawm sa lajang ai lam (sh) nbungli hte hotel daw ni lawm ai gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam ni lajang da nga ai.""  This translates to ""The cost of accommodation is considerable, especially the cost of rooms in hotels and guesthouses along the road.""

* **The question asks about:**  What causes the high cost of accommodation.

Option D directly reflects this information, stating it relates to accommodations along the road (gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam) and the higher prices associated with them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: masai marai re ai bu hkawm ai masha** - This means ""the cost of very expensive accommodation"" - doesn't explain *why* it's expensive.
* **B: madu myit hte sha galaw chye ai bu hkawm masha** -  This translates to ""the cost of accommodation that is good and comfortable"" - doesn't explain the cost.
* **C: shanhte a mungdan shang lakmat hpe galai n lu la shi ai bu hkawm masha** -  This refers to the cost related to Shan state's traditions - irrelevant to the passage.

Hkrun lam magam bungli galaw ai ni kaw na tau hkrau shawng htet da lakmat mari akyu hku nna lawu kaw na gara gaw laika hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: yawng lawm ai gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam lajang da ai lam ni.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*hkawm wa hkawm sa lajang ai lam (sh) nbungli hte hotel daw ni lawm ai gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam ni lajang da nga ai.*""  This directly translates to ""the hkrun lam (situation) where people enjoy and rest at restaurants and hotels is happening.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lawan ladan re bu hkawm ai hte seng ai laika ni** -  This doesn't relate to the described situation of enjoyment and rest.
* **B: manam dap hte seng ai myit hkrum ai lam** - This refers to a general feeling of satisfaction but isn't the specific focus of the passage.
* **D: alak mi lajang da ai lam galaw da ai** - This refers to things being broken or damaged, which isn't mentioned.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, real-time ga gale ai application ni n lu galaw ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: maigan ga hkum ni gale ya ai** (those who can afford it).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ndai amyu hpan kaw lawm ai app nkau mi gaw smartphone lang ai wa arai ni hpe dai phone hte shayawng ai ten hta pru wa ai kum ni (sh) arung arai ni hpe maigan ga hku ka da ai laika ni hpe ga gale ya lu nga ai.""  This translates to: ""...those who can afford the apps are using them on smartphones, and those who *can afford it* are the ones who are able to use them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: laika daw ni yawng hpe gale ya ai** (those who have time) - The passage doesn't focus on time as a barrier, but rather financial ability.
* **C: internet hte matut mahkai mai ai phone hku nna arai ni kaw na laika ni hpe gale ya ai** (those who have internet and phones that can access it) -  While access is *necessary*, the passage specifically highlights affordability as the limiting factor *after* access is available.
* **D: tsalam shadang hta tsa 100% aten tup hkrak jaw hkra gale ya ai** (100% accurate) - The passage doesn't mention accuracy, only accessibility based on financial means.



"
line n nga laika gale ai hpe hpa gaw ahkang jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: real-time laika gale ya ai amyu bawhpan kaw na application ni** (real-time capable communication applications).

Here's why:

The passage specifically discusses apps that allow for real-time communication (""Real-time ngu ai ga shalai ai apps""). The question asks what is being discussed in the passage. Option D directly reflects this focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: madang dep wa ai laika gale jak ni** (things that are happening around us) - Too broad, the passage focuses on *how* we connect, not just what's happening.
* **B: phone ni** (phones) - Phones are the *tools* used, not the topic of discussion.
* **C: ga hte seng ai shiga ni hpe kaga de htawt la da ai** (things that are being discussed) - Again, too broad and doesn’t specify the *type* of things being discussed.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen hte nlung tawng sharut ai lam a npawt nhpang n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: bungjat numri hkrat ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes a situation where someone is trying to understand numbers, specifically focusing on *how* to calculate or understand them (likely adding or subtracting). It mentions difficulty with numbers and needing help to understand them.  It also talks about making mistakes and needing to correct them.
* **Q's question** asks about the reason for needing to *learn* or *understand* something.
* **""bungjat numri hkrat ai lam""** translates to ""the reason for learning numbers"" or ""the purpose of understanding numbers.""  This directly addresses the core of P's text - the struggle and need to learn about numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: numri htat ai** - ""knowing numbers"" - doesn't explain *why* someone would learn them.
* **B: shinggyim masha** - ""practicing hard"" - while potentially helpful, doesn't address the underlying *reason* for learning.
* **C: jan shingkang** - ""being diligent"" - similar to 'B', it's a method, not a reason.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen hte nlung tawng sharut ai hku nna byin ai rai?","The question (Q) asks about what a number represents when it's used to count things and express quantity. The passage (P) describes numbers being used to count and measure, and how understanding numbers helps us with daily life.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: nrun mat ai numri htat (a number that is not false)** - This is too general. While true, it doesn't specifically address *what* a number *does*.
* **B: numri n nga ai dingchyung bum nhkren ni (a quantity represented by a number)** - This is a good contender. It directly relates to counting and representing amounts.
* **C: dingchyung bum nhkren ntsa na law htam ai numri (a number used to mark a position)** -  While numbers *can* be used for position (like in a list), that's not their primary function as described in the passage.
* **D: shinggyim masha ni nhkra na ngam da ai numri (a number that demonstrates power or strength)** - This is irrelevant to the basic concept of numbers and counting.

Option **B** best captures the essence of the passage's discussion about numbers representing quantities. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: numri n nga ai dingchyung bum nhkren ni**



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shat mai gaw gara gayau bang ai rai hta npawt da ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: ma-un chyu hte shan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...India maga hte kaga dan kaji a hkinggau makau shara nkau myi hkan gaw **ma-un chyu** hpe madung lang ma ai."" and ""...shan namlaw namlap ni yawng hpe madung da shat mai hka wan re.""
* The question (Q) asks what the passage says *shat mai* is related to.  The passage directly links *shat mai* to both *ma-un chyu* and *shan*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: chyu chyana hte hka:** These terms aren't specifically connected to *shat mai* in the passage.
* **B: tsi pawt ni hte namji nam-ya ni:** These are not mentioned in connection with *shat mai*.
* **D: simai simaw hte chyu:** While *simai* is mentioned, it's not directly linked to *shat mai* in the same way as *ma-un chyu* and *shan*.



"
"Nkau shara ni hta, ma-un chyu hpe shat mai hta kalang marang gara gayau ai rai a malai jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: shan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...India maga hte kaga dan kaji a hkinggau makau shara nkau myi hkan gaw ma-un chyu hpe madung lang ma ai.""  This translates to ""...the disputes between India and the Kachin people regarding land and resources, and the conflicts involving civilian casualties, do *not* support the claim of peace.""
* **The question asks:** What, regarding civilian casualties, doesn't support the claim of peace?
* **""Shan""** (likely referring to the Shan people who are often involved in conflict areas) is the closest connection to civilian casualties and the lack of peace described in the passage.  The passage heavily implies conflict and hardship in these regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: simai simaw** -  This doesn't have a clear connection to the content of the passage.
* **C: chyu chyana** - While ""chyu"" (peace) is mentioned, the passage *disputes* the existence of peace.
* **D: namji nam-ya ni** - This phrase doesn't have a direct relationship to the passage's theme.



"
Transantarctic Bum makau maja magaw gaw kawngtsaw bumpa de du na matu ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Ross Painglai hku na bu hkawm ai hta grau loi ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai shara gaw hkyen ni hte hkyen hka lwi hkang ni hte chyu hpring chyat nga nna dawnghkawn hte masat tawn da ai... Ndai ni gaw nau n lawan ai majaw hkrun lam gaw kawng tsaw bumpa de du na matu Transantarctic bum ni makau kaw grai galu hkra magaw kau ra ai.""  This translates to: ""This route is difficult and challenging due to ice cracks and crevasses... Therefore, it is said that the Transantarctic Mountains are a major obstacle on the way to the South Pole.""  The passage directly links the Transantarctic Mountains to being an obstacle *from* Ross Ice Shelf.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo Dap gaw jahkring hkring pat ai** (McMurdo Camp is very cold) - While likely true, this isn't related to the question about the Transantarctic Mountains.
* **B: adak bang da ai numri gaw hkrit tsang ra ai** (The number of dogs used is increasing) -  The passage doesn't mention dogs or numbers.
* **C: laksan galaw shapraw da ai mawdaw jak ni gaw lawan ladan n re ai** (The difficult terrain has been overcome) - The passage states the terrain *is* difficult, not that it has been overcome.



"
"Dingda Pole Traverse ding yang, hpa hpe dawnghkawn hte masat da ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: hkyen hte hpring taw ai hkyen ugang ga hkang** (it traversed through ice and snow, and across crevasses).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Dai shara gaw hkyen ni hte hkyen hka lwi hkang ni hte chyu hpring chyat nga nna dawnghkawn hte masat tawn da ai."" This directly translates to ""This traverse went through ice and snow and across crevasses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo dabang kaw na hkrun lam** (the path from McMurdo) - While the traverse *started* from McMurdo, the question asks what it traversed *through*, not where it started from.
* **B: sau gunrai htaw ai madaw jak ni** (difficult terrain) - The passage mentions difficult terrain, but it doesn't identify that as what it traversed *through*. It's a characteristic *of* the terrain.
* **D: bum makau hta hkrit tsang hpa maja magaw ni** (mountains) - The passage mentions the Transantarctic Mountains but doesn’t say the traverse went *through* them, only near them.



"
Dingda Afrika de sa du masam maram ai shaloi maigan bu hkawn ai ni hku nna sadi da ra ai lama mi hpe lawu na laika kaw n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: mungdan n bung hkat ai hta mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng lam n bung ai**

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focuses on Challenges:** The passage details the difficulties of traveling in Africa – rough roads (""4x4 hpe gaw grai madi shadaw ai""), the remoteness and challenges of finding established routes (""beaten path...sa du na matu kaja ai lam re""), and the feeling of being lost or disoriented (""laklai ai tara upadi ni nga ai re"").  It specifically mentions the struggle with navigation and finding the right paths (""mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng lam n bung ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai gaw beaten path shara ni de sa du na matu kaja ai lam re** - While the passage mentions difficulties finding established paths, it doesn't say the *act of traveling* is hard to find. It's the paths themselves that are hard to find.
* **C: Dingda Africa na htingbu mungdan ni yawng ngu na ram gaw simsa ai** - The passage doesn't focus on the simplicity of the landscapes, but rather the challenges of navigating them.
* **D: mawdaw hte bu hkawm yang 4x4 hpe madi shadaw da ai** - This is a detail *about* the travel, not the main problem/difficulty.  The passage uses needing a 4x4 as an example of *why* it's challenging, not the challenge itself.



Therefore, option A best captures the central idea of the passage: the difficulty of finding your way and getting lost in the African wilderness."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Dingda Africa hpe mawdaw hte bu hkawm mayu ai masha ni a matu nkaja ai hpaji jaw ai lam hku na sawn lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai gaw ayan lam ni kaw na n re sha kaga lam hku sa mayu ai ni a matu kaja ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mawdaw hte dingda Africa de shangwa ai lam gaw ginra a tsawm htap ai yawng hte ayan mungkan bu hkawm masha ni hkawm ai lam na shara hkan lu du hkring yu lu na matu mau hpa lam ladat re.""  This translates to something like: ""The passage about how Mawdaw and Africa's issues are related to the difficulties of traveling and the problems faced by those who try to help/support.""
* **It also states:** ""mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai gaw ayan lam ni kaw na n re sha kaga lam hku sa mayu ai ni a matu kaja ai"" - meaning ""Mawdaw and those who support him are having difficulties because the road conditions are bad and it's hard to get things done.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Tara upadai hku nna in-car ahkyak ahkya rai nkau hpe ra na re"" - This isn't directly supported by the text.
* **B:** ""4x4 hpe madi shadaw da tim, shara law law hpe ayan mawdaw hte sa du mai ai"" - While the passage mentions 4x4 vehicles, it's not the main point. It's a detail about the difficulty of travel.
* **D:** ""Dingda Africa na htingbu mungdan ni yawng gaw sa du bu hkawm na matu kaja htum n re"" - This is related to problems within Dingda Africa, but doesn't address the core issue of *why* things are difficult for Mawdaw and supporters.



"
Tinang na rai ni hpe n'gawn nsawn di ngam da ai a majaw byin wa mai ai hkrit tsang na lam ngu lawu na gara hpe laika hta n tsun da rai?,"The correct answer is **B: tinang gaw nanghpam gun hpai ai wa hku byin wa chye ai** (Tinang felt ashamed because of what happened).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Tinang's shame and embarrassment.** The text repeatedly mentions feelings of shame (""nanghpam tsi shabra ai wa hku,"" ""nanghpam gun hpai ai wa hku"") and the desire to hide (""lai ai shaloi tinang"").  The entire passage describes a situation that caused Tinang to feel deeply embarrassed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rai ni lagu la hkrum mai ai** (The rain didn't stop) - While rain is mentioned, it's a backdrop to the emotional story, not the core issue.
* **C: kaga masha na rai hte shut mat chye ai** (The paper got wet from the rain) -  This is a detail *within* the story, but not the main takeaway.
* **D: byin wa na bawm jahkrit shama ai lam hku nna daru magam ni mai mu chye ai** (It didn't seem to care about helping those who were struggling) - The passage doesn't focus on a lack of help or caring. It's about Tinang's personal shame.



Therefore, **B** best captures the central theme of the passage – Tinang’s feeling of shame."
Namhpam gun hpai ai lam hte seng nna hpa hpe laika hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: tau hkrau sadi jaw da ai lam n nga sha nanghpam manam ai gwi ni hpe mai jai ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on a feeling of being overwhelmed and burdened.** The speaker describes a heavy load (""karum yang""), suffering (""seng ai lamu""), and a sense of being lost (""mungkan ga daga""). They feel unable to cope with their responsibilities (""hpe lai ai shaloi tinang"").
* **Option C directly addresses this feeling of being unable to handle things.** It translates to something like ""because of the difficulties faced, they couldn't overcome the problems that caused them worry."" This aligns with the overall tone of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Focuses on a lack of ability, but doesn't capture the emotional weight of the passage.
* **B:** Mentions teamwork, which is not discussed in the text.
* **D:** Talks about taking responsibility, which is the opposite of what the speaker is expressing – they *feel* unable to take responsibility.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the central theme of the passage: the inability to cope with overwhelming difficulties and the resulting emotional distress."
Lawu kaw na gara luhpa gaw nta makau hkan ban sa ai laman nta hta galaw yu mai ai ngu n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: hpalap**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jahpawt hta na nta ting manu dan ai kaphi lu nna shana gaw **chamomile hpalap** lu nna shalan shabran u."" (In the beginning, they drank chamomile **tea** and were relaxed.)  The question asks what the passage mentions as being drunk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: namsi ntsin** (salt) - Mentioned, but not *drunk*.
*   **B: kahpi** (coffee) - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: beer chyaru** (beer) - Not mentioned in the passage.



"
tinang a buga mare gaw tsa lu ai htunghking hte mying gumhkawng ai rai yang nta makau hkan ban sa ai laman gara de sa du mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: chamomile hpalap shadu ai lusha seng ni**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jahpawt hta na nta ting manu dan ai kaphi lu nna shana gaw **chamomile hpalap** lu nna shalan shabran u."" (The passage mentions chamomile tea being given to someone who is sick).  The question asks about what helps the person feel better, and the text directly links chamomile tea to relief.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tinang na htingbu shinggan na kahpi seng ni** - This doesn't relate to the remedy mentioned in the text.
* **B: namsi ntsin (sh) namsi hte chyu chyana ni kayau ai ntsin seng ni** - This refers to a general feeling or sense, not a specific cure.
* **C: tinang nau nsa ga ai tsa seng ni** - This is about the person's state of being (feeling cold), not a solution.



"
Uhkru jangnai ni gara shara kaw nga rai?,"The correct answer is **A: mare kaw na hkying hkum ka'ang sa ra ai kaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Myit shang sha hpa mare kahtawng de sa chyai na matu hkying hkum mi jan ram sha hkawm ra ai."" This translates to ""...The upper part of the mountain, due to the rocks, is gathering many people who are interested in climbing.""  Therefore, the *reason* for the gathering (uhkru jangnai) is related to climbing the rocks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nawku jawng wang kaw** (Nawku jawng area) - While the passage mentions Nawku jawng, it doesn't explain *why* people are gathering.
* **C: Eysturoy zinlawng kaw** (Eysturoy mountain) -  Eysturoy is the location, but not the *reason* for the gathering.
* **D: nawku jawng kata kaw** (Nawku jawng path) - The passage doesn't focus on a path, but on the climbing itself.



"
gara mungdan shang lakmat hpan gaw marai langai ngai hku nna gumhpraw n-gun law law nga ai lam sakse ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Jawng ma visa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Jawng ma visa ni gaw laga hpaga dai nrai sa chyai ai visa galaw ai lam ngut nna ra ai madi shadaw laika ni nbung ma ai.""  This translates to ""This special visa is the visa that can be extended when necessary.""  The passage is discussing a visa that allows for extension, which is what ""Jawng ma visa"" refers to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hpaga visa:** The passage mentions ""hpaga dai"" (can be extended) *about* the Jawng ma visa, but it doesn't identify ""Hpaga visa"" as the specific type.
*   **B: Sa chyai visa:** This refers to a visa that can be cancelled, the opposite of what the passage describes.
*   **C: chyahkring chyahkra visa:** This doesn't appear in the text and isn't relevant to the discussion of extendable visas.



"
Kadai gaw jat la da ai mungdan shang lakmat ra na byin mai dik rai?,"The correct answer is **A: ayan mungkan bu hkawm ai bu hkawm masha langai** (It seems like the main point is about needing a visa/permit).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on the need for a visa (or permit - ""visa"" is used repeatedly).**  It discusses difficulties obtaining one, what happens if you don't have one, and the consequences. The entire text revolves around this issue.
* **Let's break down the passage:** It talks about people needing permits to travel, facing problems, and the importance of having the correct documentation.  The core issue is *having the necessary paperwork* (the visa/permit).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: du hkra hte seng nna bu hkaw ai wa** (It seems like it's about hardship and suffering) - While hardship is *mentioned* as a result of not having a visa, it's not the central theme.
* **C: Maigan jawng ma langai** (It doesn't seem important) - The passage clearly demonstrates the visa is *extremely* important.
* **D: Hpaga yamga bu hkawm ai wa** (It seems like it's about being happy) - The passage is decidedly *not* about happiness; it's about a stressful situation involving travel and legal requirements.



Therefore, option A best captures the main idea of the passage."
Galoi hta jigrawng hpe atsawm sadi ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: marang maling hta**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states ""...Ginhtawng ta hta marang maling hkan lagaw lam..."" and focuses on things happening *within* the marang maling (orange garden).  The question (Q) asks where the digging/excavation is happening. Therefore, the orange garden is the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ginhtawng shata ni laman:** This refers to the ground generally, not a specific location.
*   **B: Bum lung yang:**  This means ""it's on the hill,"" which isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: mawdaw jawn ai shaloi:** This refers to where the fruit fell, not where someone is digging.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, marang maling hta mawdaw gau shaloi jigrawng ni hpe koi na matu hpa galaw ai kaw na shayawm ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: mawdaw chying hka ni hpe grai na hkra hpaw da ai lam** (the way to practice to get used to timing).

Here's why:

* **P's passage** describes struggling with timing in singing (specifically, getting the ""beat"" right). It mentions needing practice to get comfortable.
* **Q's question** asks what helps with getting used to timing.
* **Option A** directly addresses this by saying practicing timing (getting used to the timing) is the solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ginhtawng ta laman mawdaw gau ai** (just being familiar with the song) - While familiarity helps, it doesn't directly address the *timing* issue.
* **C: kahtet yawm ginra shara ni hkan mawdaw gau ai** (getting used to the feeling of singing) - This is about the *feel* of singing, not the timing.
* **D: lagaw lam hkawm hkrun lam sa shaloi mawdaw hpe n'gawn nsawn ngam da ai** (understanding the song's structure) -  Understanding structure is useful, but again, doesn't solve the timing problem itself.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Sundarban ni hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: dai gaw mungkan kaba dik panglai makau kaw na hpun ni re.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sundarbans hpe UNESCO Mungkan a Sali wunli ginra hku na ndau shabra hkrum lai wa sai."" This directly translates to ""Sundarbans has been recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.""
* **Option C** reflects this information – ""dai gaw mungkan kaba dik panglai makau kaw na hpun ni re"" means ""this is a world heritage site.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention specific difficulties in access.
* **B:** While the passage mentions the mangrove forest, it doesn't say this *is* the main reason for its importance.
* **D:** While the Royal Bengal tiger is mentioned, the passage doesn’t state that it's the *primary* reason for Sundarbans' significance.



"
nam maling a gara daw gaw Kala mung lamu ga lapran nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarban Myusha Nampan sun**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kala mung shingwang kata na nam maling nampan sun hpe Sundarbans amyu sha nampan sun ngu tsun ma ai re."" This directly translates to ""The mangrove forests and tidal forests are considered the Sundarbans' unique ecosystem."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dusat dumyeng ni a shimbyi shara:** This refers to a wildlife sanctuary and the animals within it (Royal Bengal tigers, deer), but doesn't describe what the mangrove forests *are*.
* **C: Mungkan Sali Wunli makawp Shara:** This refers to UNESCO recognition, not the forest itself.
* **D: Gangetic pa layang:** This describes the geographical origin of the land (Gangetic plain), not the forest type.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Inglik ga hpe yawm dik chye na ai lam hpe kadai gaw mahkoi lu mayu na rai?","The correct answer is **B: asak kaji ai masha ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...grau nna gaw asak kaji ai ramma ni rai nga ai."" This translates to ""...the places where people go are places that are often talked about.""  The question asks what the places mentioned (like Boston, Sydney, etc.) have in common. They are all ""asak kaji ai"" - often talked about, or popular places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kaga ga yawm dik lahkawng hpe shaga ai masha ni:**  This refers to places that cause problems, which isn't the main point of the passage.
* **C: Toronto de bu hkawm sa ai ni:**  Toronto is just *one* of the places mentioned, not a common characteristic of *all* of them.
* **D: asak kaba ai ni:** ""Asak kaba"" means ""expensive,"" and while some of these cities might be expensive, the passage doesn't focus on cost.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa hpe nsen lu shapraw na matu yak na rai?","The correct answer is **C: laika ka da ai gasi ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Laika ka da ai ga si ni gaw shaga ai ga si ni hta grau chye na loi ai."" This translates to ""The things that are happening now are the things that are causing problems.""  This directly links the current situation (laika) to the problems being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: n bung ai nsen hte re ai gasi ni:** While the passage mentions things happening, it doesn't specifically state *those* things are the cause.
* **B: hkring dat ni:**  ""Hkring dat"" means ""something is missing"" and isn't mentioned as a cause of the problems.
* **D: buga mare masha rau shada sha chye na ai ga:** This refers to traveling to different cities and isn't related to the root cause of the issues.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""sinpraw maga hte Jakar Bumthang de sa ai mawdaw ni gaw 06:30 hte 7:30 aten lapran kaw pru ai re.""  This means the bus departs from Sinpraw Maga and Jakar Bumthang between 6:30 and 7:30. Option D is the closest and most accurate reflection of this information - it states the bus departs from Sinpraw Maga around 6:20.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Mentions Jarkar, which isn't a departure point stated in the text.
*   **B:** Mentions Bumthang as the starting point, but the text states it's *along with* Sinpraw Maga. Also, 7 o'clock is a departure *time*, not a location.
*   **C:** Mentions Paro and a departure time of 11, neither of which are mentioned as departure locations or times in the passage.

Ginwang kata hkawm ai mawdaw dap kaw na sinpraw maga de bu hkawm na matu masing nga ai bu hkawm ai wa matu hpa gaw kaja ai ga machyan rai na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 8:30 hpang sha mawdaw ni pru ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mawdaw jawn masha ni rau pawng nna shap jawn mawdaw ni gaw Paro (Nu 150) hte Punakha (Nu 200) zawn re ai ninawn ai ginra ni de bu hkawm na matu gaw lawan nna jawn pyaw ai re."" This translates to something like: ""The time the bus leaves after picking up passengers is around 8:30.""  The question asks about *when* the bus leaves after picking up passengers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: madang tsaw ai lakmat hpe mari na** (something about being late) - The passage mentions lateness as a negative thing, but doesn't state it *happens* when the bus departs.
* **C: shani tup mawdaw law law pru ai** (the bus leaves frequently) - The passage doesn't mention frequency.
* **D: jawm shap mawdaw gaw kaja dik ai bu hkawm ai lam re** (something about the bus being full) - While the passage mentions passengers, it doesn't focus on the bus being full as a key detail of departure time.

"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Timbuktu na tup hkrak gawn dan ai lam n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: mung na ngam ai yawng hta Arabic amyu shingkang shingna grau nga ai** (in the context, Arabic language and culture greatly influenced it).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai myu gaw mungdan hpe grai shai taw ai, hpamajaw nga yang African masha hta Arbic masha grau law ai majaw re.""  This directly translates to ""This city greatly influenced the region, and especially Arabic culture greatly influenced African culture here.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shi a matsan chyaren re ai lam** (the story of being a prosperous city) - While Timbuktu *was* prosperous, the passage focuses on *how* it became significant, not just *that* it was.
* **C: Nbungli hte n mai du lu ai lam** (the story of conflict and decline) - The passage mentions decline (1990s) but doesn't make it the central theme of how Timbuktu gained prominence.
* **D: Masam maram myit katu ai mungkan bu hkawm ai ni a matu myit shang sha hpa re ai lam** (the importance of the accumulated knowledge of the scholars) - While knowledge is *part* of Timbuktu’s story, the passage specifically highlights the cultural influence (Arabic) as a key factor.



"
Lawu kaw na gara teng man ai lam gaw Timbuktu hte seng nna jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: dai gaw matsan ai hta laklai ai gaw grau ai** (this place is famous for what is written on it).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Timbuktu gaw matsan mat ai mare kaba re mat sai, raitim de a mying gumhkawng ai lam gaw bu hkawm masha ni hpe myit agang shangun ai hte dai hta nbungli pa nga ai re.""  This translates to: ""Timbuktu is a place known for its writing, the words written on it are highly valued and respected.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mare gaw pyenli hte mai lu du ai** (the place is changing and not stable) - The passage doesn't focus on instability.
* **C: htingbu mare ni hta grau Afrika masha ni a hkritung atsam yawm ai** (this place has a history of African culture and scholarship) - While likely true, the passage *specifically* highlights the writing.
* **D: Dai mare gaw mungkan bu hkawm ai ni a myit hpe n lu gang sai** (this place doesn't understand the value of knowledge) - The passage clearly states the writing *is* valued.



"
Madung hta ginhtawng Olympic hpe galoi lamang galaw masat da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **B: 2020 shata man masum** (2020 year held).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...coronavirus htee seng nna shaning 2020 shata tsanit du hkra njaw sai."" This translates to ""...due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 year was postponed.""  While ultimately held in 2021, the *intended* year for the Olympics was 2020.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 2021 shata man matsat:** While the Olympics *took place* in 2021, the question asks when it was originally *scheduled* to be held.
*   **C: 2021 shata man jahku:** ""Jahku"" means five, and doesn't relate to when the Olympics were held.
*   **D: 2020 shata man sanit:** ""Sanit"" means January, and doesn't relate to when the Olympics were held.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masat hta hti gaw bunghpoi laru byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: nbung laru summwi ni kaw na yu hkrat wa ai**.

* **The passage states:** ""Shanhte gaw nbung laru kaw na summwi ni hti zawn yu wa ai hku hpang wa nna shanhte ni ga de hkra ai hte gaw bunghpoi laru byin wa ai re.""  This translates to ""They say that the aircraft can fly high enough to reach the summit, and because of that, they can observe the bunghpoi laru.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nbung gaw hking hkum langai hta 100 deng ram du shaloi** (The aircraft flies 100 miles in the sky) - The passage mentions speed (100-200 miles/hour) but doesn't state a fixed distance flown.
* **B: nbung shadawn ni kyi hpang wa ten** (The aircraft flies based on shadows) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: ga hpe hkra ngut ai hpang** (It flies to observe the group) - While it *does* observe something, the passage specifically links the flight to observing the ""bunghpoi laru"" because of its altitude.

This translates to: ""They (storms) can cause damage to roofs by blowing them away at speeds of (around 100-200 miles/hour), and also cause damage where the storm passes.""

* **The question asks:** What causes damage from the storm?

* **Option A** directly addresses this, saying the damage is caused by winds blowing at 100-200 miles per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This refers to mountains blocking roads, not the cause of damage.
* **C:**  Talks about funnel clouds, which aren't the primary damage-causing factor mentioned.
* **D:**  Refers to the storm strengthening, not the direct cause of damage.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm wa gaw shanhte a sa mayu ai mare a mung masa lam hte seng nna gara kaw na hpaji la ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: shanhte sa du na mung a asuya kaw na** (meaning: the Shan people only resent those who have more than them).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...nang mungdan a hpaji jaw ai lam ni hpe nang na nang hpaji jaw mayu na re raitimung shanhte a hpaji jaw ai lam ni gaw mungdan masha ni a matu yaw shada nna galaw da ai re.""  This translates to: ""...the things you are proud of, you resent the Shan people when they are also proud of them.""  This directly indicates resentment towards the success or possessions of others (those ""with more"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bu hkawm ai hte seng ai hpaji jaw laika hta tang madun da ai ningmu ni** (something about pride being lost when others succeed) - While the passage touches on pride, it doesn't specifically say pride *is lost*; it says it's resented.
* **C: shanhte sa du na mung masha ni kaw na** (the Shan people only care about possessions) - The passage doesn't focus on a general love of possessions; it's about a negative reaction *to others* having possessions.
* **D: shanhte a madu asuya kaw na** (the Shan people resent everyone) - The passage is specific - they resent those who are *proud* and *have* things, not everyone generally.

"bu hkawm ai hte seng ai hpaji jaw laika mabyin hta, maigan mung masha hku nna gara hpe mahkrum madup byin na matu n nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: hkra machyi mat ai hkam kaja lam hte seng ai pahkam** (the condition of being able to understand the language and being able to speak it).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the ability to understand and *speak* a language as being crucial for connection and navigating the world.** It talks about how understanding languages allows you to access information and connect with different cultures (referencing American, European, and Arab powers).  The core idea is the practical benefit of linguistic ability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dawm kau hkrum ai hkra machyi mat ai pahkam** (the condition of only knowing a little and understanding a little) - This is too limited. The passage implies a *full* grasp of language is important, not just a partial one.
* **B: mungdan a mung masa lam hte seng nna atang shalang di kau ai ga shagyin ni** (the importance of being able to speak the language of the people in a place) - While relevant, it doesn't capture the broader idea of understanding different cultures and powers, as highlighted in the text.
* **D: mungdan a mung masa lam hte seng nna hkrum tsup ai shiga** (the ability to speak the language of the people in a place, but only superficially) - Similar to A, this is too limited and focuses on superficial understanding.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the passage's emphasis on comprehensive language skills – both understanding *and* speaking – as a key to navigating and understanding the world."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bu hkawm hpan gaw bu hkawm kasa kaw na karum shingtau lam ra na yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: bu hkawm ai wa shawng de n du ga ai mare kaw na bungli zung-ya de bu hkawm ai lam.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses a situation where someone is trying to find a house/property (""hkrun lam""). It highlights the difficulty in finding a good one and mentions agents and websites. The question asks *what kind* of property the passage is referring to.

Option A (""the kind of property that is desirable and good, and where the process of finding it is difficult"") best captures the essence of the passage. The text implies the property is sought after (""tsa ban 19 ning hkan na nga taw sai re"" - good and desirable) and hard to find (""man man tau htet ai hpe sharawng ma timung"" - difficult to find).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: laksan jai jarik hte bat lahkawng na ai bu hkawm hkrun lam** - This doesn't align with the passage; there's no mention of specific characteristics like ""laksan jai jarik"" or ""bat lahkawng.""
* **C: tsun shaga ga madin malai byin mai ai bu hkawm hkrun lam** -  This refers to a property that is quickly sold, which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **D: bu hkawm ai wa na maigan de shawng sa du ai hkrun lam** - This means a property that isn't good or desirable, which contradicts the passage's implication of seeking a good property.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tinang atsawm n chye ai shingra maka ni, htunghking ningli ni, tsun shaga ga ni nga ai mungdan shing nrai, matsan ai mungdan ni de sa mayu ai nga yang gaw bu hkawm bungli dat kasa ni hpe lata ging ai.""

This translates to: ""...the things that are remembered and understood, things that are carefully considered, things that are brought up in meetings, things that are useful even when old are what make up this collective knowledge.""  This directly relates to option C, which speaks about remembering (tinang) and understanding (atsawm chye) things that are useful (mayu ai buga).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Focuses on being ""satisfied"" which isn't the main point of the passage.
* **B:** Mentions ""planning"" which isn't discussed in the text.
* **D:**  Talks about ""carefully observing"" which isn't the core idea presented.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shara nnan de bu hkawm ai shaloi bu hkawm ai ni hku nna myit htum ai lam hpe koi yen na matu hpa gaw karum lu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: shanhte sa wa ai mungdan kaw na madang ni hpe sha myit mada da na**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** discusses someone sharing their experiences and feelings, especially negative ones (""hkrunlam n hkawm shi yang,"" ""masha, mawdaw htinglet""). It also mentions the desire to understand *why* these feelings are happening (""na nta zaawn rai na ngu myit mada lam n tawn ga"").  The passage culminates in a longing to be free from these burdens (""jauman masha ni nra ai hpe n galaw hkrup na"").

* **The Question (Q)** asks what would help someone understand the *reason* behind the feelings described in the passage.

* **Option A (""shanhte sa wa ai mungdan kaw na madang ni hpe sha myit mada da na"" - roughly translates to ""Understanding the root cause of problems from wise people"")** directly addresses the need to understand the *source* or *cause* of the suffering (the ""madang""). Seeking guidance from wise people (""shanhte sa wa ai mungdan"") is a logical way to find that understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on dealing with existing sadness, not *understanding* its source.
* **C:** Talks about accepting circumstances, which isn't the primary focus of the passage - the person wants to *know why* things are the way they are.
* **D:**  Describes a situation relating to a specific relationship, which isn't the central theme of the passage.



Therefore, **A** best answers the question based on the content of the passage."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masha hpan gaw mungdan shara mi de bu hkawm ai shaloi myit htum ai lam hkrum mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: laklai ai lusha hpe ra sharawng ai masha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** describes someone who remembers and shares stories (hkrunlam) and experiences (hkawm shi) from their life. It specifically mentions remembering joyful things like festivals (masha), weddings (mawdaw htinglet), and gatherings.  The passage emphasizes *sharing* those memories.
* **The question (Q)** asks what kind of ""masha"" (festivals/joyful events) the passage focuses on – specifically, those that are remembered and shared.
* **Option A (""laklai ai lusha hpe ra sharawng ai masha"" - festivals/joyful events that are remembered and shared)** directly aligns with the content of the passage.  The whole point of the passage is about recalling and relating experiences.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** ""galai shai ai lam hpe ra sharawng ai lam kaba ai masha"" - Festivals related to saying things - doesn’t fit the context.
    * **C:** ""myit gyip ai masha"" - Important festivals – while some remembered festivals might be important, the passage doesn't emphasize *importance* as the key characteristic.
    * **D:** ""hkaja ai lam hpe ra sharawng ai masha"" - Festivals related to doing things – Doesn’t fit the context.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer because it accurately captures the core theme of the passage – the act of remembering and sharing joyful experiences."
Prat dep mung de shawng nna bu hkawm ai mungkan bu hkawm ai ni a matu lawu kaw na gara hpe madi shadaw hpaji jaw n'galaw da rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Camp galaw yang yup ku kaji (sh) singgoi hpe lang na matu hpaji jaw da ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:** ""Lama nang camp pru hkawm na re yang, lapu, n-gaw gawk zawn re kaw na makawp lu na matu yup ku kaji sing goi hpai gun u.""  This translates to something like, ""If you are part of the camp, then you will definitely know how to use this thing (sing goi).""
* **The question asks:** About understanding how to use something related to the gathering/group (bu hkawm).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Ga hta nyup shi yang jau man ginra ni hpe hkau chyap hkra galaw na"" - This refers to remembering something from the past, not practical knowledge of an item.
* **B:** ""Tinang a shawng manga ya hkan lusha kaw gumhpraw jai ai hpe koi yen na"" -  This speaks to observing something, not *knowing how to use* something.
* **D:** ""tinang shawng nnan du yang madang dep manam dap hta arang bang na"" - This is about recognizing different types of feelings, which isn't related to the question.



Therefore, option C directly addresses the idea of possessing knowledge/skill related to something within the camp/gathering, as stated in the passage."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw rawt maja wa ai mungdan hta nga shamawn ai shaloi gumhpraw majoi joi jai ra ai ngu n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sinna mung lai malu masha ni hta**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily focuses on the difficulties and hardships faced by people (represented by ""bu hkawm"" - people/community) and their struggles for survival. It mentions suffering (""atsam rawng ai bu hkawm""), hardship (""grau nna""), and the importance of remembering past pain (""Sinna hkran ni a prat lai kasi lang ai lam"").  The phrase ""sinna mung lai malu masha ni hta"" (in the past, many people suffered a lot) directly reflects this central theme of past hardship.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: madang kaja ai galaw lajang magam ni hta (where work is hard and resources are scarce):** While the passage *implies* hardship, it doesn't specifically focus on work or resource scarcity.
* **C: camp na matu si htun (sh) rai magap (it's difficult to live in the camp):** The passage mentions ""camp pru hkawm na re"" (being in the camp), but this is a small part of the broader discussion of overall suffering.
* **D: madang kaja ai manam gawk ni (having a difficult personality):** This has absolutely no connection to the main theme of the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer as it directly addresses the core message of the text – the past suffering of the people."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Na rungrai bang ai baw hte online kaw kanan langai tawn u (na email kaw dai hpe kapyawn sa u (sh) """"""""clooud"""""""" kaw zing da u).""  This translates to: ""You can save it and access it online (you can keep your email data with (sh) """"""""cloud"""""""").""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bu hkawm manang hpe hkrang bung langai jaw ai** - The passage doesn't focus on saving names.
* **B: hkrang bung langai hpe tinang de bai email galaw ai** - While email is mentioned, the passage focuses on *where* to save the data, not just sending it via email.
* **C: shanhte a lang hkawm mai ai komputa matsing hta hkrang bung hpe jahting da ai** - The passage mentions laptops and tablets, but doesn't say the data is saved *on* those devices primarily, but rather accessible *through* them using internet access.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkrang tara hta madun n ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: pahkam hkam ai wa na email hkring dat**.

This translates to ""and they are requesting you to report the email address of the person who sent the email.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mungdan ga daga hte seng ai phone nambat ni:** While phone numbers are mentioned as being used, the passage doesn't directly ask for *them* to be reported.
*   **C: galaw ahkang ni na matu mungdan ga daga hte seng ai phone nambat ni:** This combines incorrect elements of A and is too broad.
*   **D: hkrang tara jum lang ai wa na email hkring dat:** The passage asks for the email address of the sender, not just *any* email address received.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara negative size gaw jai lang ai film format sumla dawng pru dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: 56 by 56 mm negative**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nkau camera kasha ni gaw 6 by 6 cm format hpe lang ma ai, 56 by 56 mm negative gaw grau hkrak ai re.""  This directly translates to ""This camera uses a 6 by 6 cm format, and a 56 by 56 mm negative is produced.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 6 by 6 cm negative:** While the camera *uses* a 6x6cm format, the *negative itself* is 56x56mm.
*   **C: 35 mm negative:** The passage contrasts this camera with 35mm cameras.
*   **D: 36 by 24 mm negative:** This refers to the size of a 35mm negative, which is different from the camera discussed in the text.



"
Lawu kaw na gara sumla hkrung gayet ai hkrang ni gaw DSLR hte bung ai dan leng ai lam resolution hpe jaw ai rai?,"The passage states the 6 by 6 cm format (resulting in 56 by 56 mm negatives) has a significantly larger area than the 35 mm negative.  Larger negative area generally translates to higher resolution.  The question asks which format yields a resolution similar to DSLR and digital cameras. Since the passage implies the 6x6 format is closer in quality, the answer is:

**D: 6 by 6 cm sumla hkrung**

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 35 mm sumla hkrung:** The passage explicitly states this has a *smaller* area/resolution.
* **B: pran wan madang-hkrang sumla hkrung:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: 56 by 56 mm sumla hkrung:** This is just the negative size of the 6x6 format, not the format itself. The *format* is what matters for resolution.

* **The question asks:** What is the main point the passage is trying to convey about creating a blog?
* **The passage states:** It's about being able to share things (your thoughts, experiences) widely through the internet.
* **Option A directly reflects this:** ""internet laika man hkrang galaw ai hpe shakyang na"" translates to ""being able to share widely on the internet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  Focuses on *having* a blog, not the purpose of having one.
* **C:** Talks about *your* website, which is a consequence of blogging, not the core idea.
* **D:**  Mentions appealing content, which is *how* to get people to read your blog, not *why* you create one.

"Bu hkawm laika ka ai hpaga yumga hpe hpang ai shaloi, lawu kaw na gara atsam hpe shawng nnan makoi shatsawm garang ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: internet laika man hta laika ka ai lam** (things that are being talked about on the internet).

Here's why:

* **The prompt (P)** discusses how people are sharing and reading things online – blogs, websites, etc.  It's about what's *happening* on the internet.
* **The question (Q)** asks what someone should do if they see something interesting. The most logical response is to find out what others are saying about it *on the internet*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: internet laika man hkrang galaw ai lam** (things that are moving around on the internet) – This is too vague.  The prompt is about *content*, not just activity.
* **C: laka jep shagrin ai lam** (things that are secretly being discussed) – The prompt is about public sharing, not secrecy.
* **D: website hpan ai lam** (things on a website) – While websites are involved, the question is about broader discussion, not just what's on *one* website.



"
gara du hkra ladaw hpan gaw pu hte seng ai ana manghkang law malawng mu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kashung ai du hkra ladaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Grau kashung ai du hkra ladaw ni hta nsa sa lam manghkang nga chye ai zawn..."" which translates to ""...in contaminated food, various problems can arise...""  It directly links contaminated food (du hkra ladaw) to causing problems (nsa sa lam manghkang).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mungkan a dingdung kaw na du hkra ladaw** - The passage doesn't focus on food that *looks* bad, but food that *is* contaminated.
* **C: Kahtet ai du hkra ladaw** - ""Kahtet"" means rotten, but the passage focuses on bacterial contamination, not just general spoilage.
* **D: Marang nlaw ai du hkra ladaw** -  ""Marang nlaw"" means old or stale. While old food can be contaminated, the passage emphasizes the *source* of the problem being contamination itself.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan hkra ai gaw hpa na dang hkam jan ai de woi gindun wa mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: buga ginra ana kanu ni**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses illnesses caused by contaminated food and water – essentially, things you *eat* (buga ginra). It highlights how bacteria in food can cause sickness, referencing historical examples like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's ailments, and Montezuma's revenge.  The passage emphasizes the link between what you ingest and getting sick.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pu hte seng ai ana manghkang ni** (things that are only made with water) - While water contamination is mentioned, the passage focuses on *food* as a primary source of illness.
* **C: nsa sa ai hte seng ai manghkang ni** (things that are only made with salt) - Salt isn't the central theme of the passage.
* **D: Delhi Belly** - Delhi Belly is *an example* of a sickness caused by contaminated food/water, not the general cause itself.

Therefore, **buga ginra ana kanu ni** (contaminated food) is the most accurate answer to the question of what causes the illnesses described in the passage.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Schengen ginwang lapran bu hkawm ai na akyu rai?","The correct answer is **A: mungdan shang lakmat application law law hpe koi yen mai ai** (meaning: applications for entering the country are not accepted).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai Schengen ginwang gaw ndai lam hta mungdan langai hku sha re ngu mai sawn la ai."" This translates to ""This Schengen area does not allow entry into this country.""
* **This directly implies** that applications to enter (mungdan shang lakmat application) will be rejected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gumhpraw mahkawng mayu yang** (Problems with paperwork) - While paperwork *could* be a problem, the passage explicitly says entry is *not allowed* due to the Schengen area status.
* **C: maigan pru hkawm lakmat hkang jep ai shara law law hpe koi yen mai ai** (Applications for people with proof of funds are not accepted) - The passage doesn't mention anything about financial proof.
* **D: maigan pru hkawm lakmat ra rawng ai lam n nga ai** (Applications for people with proof of accommodation are not accepted) -  Similar to C, the passage doesn't discuss accommodation.



"
Tutankhamun na lupwa kata hta hpa hpe n mu lu mai sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: mang jahkraw na lahpa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mang jahraw hpe da-u kaw na shaw na matu galaw ai shaloi hten mat ai lam sakse hpe yu na matu myit lawm ai masha kadai raitimung, **baw hte lahpa ni hpe sha mai mu lu ai re majaw myit daw mat na re.**"" 

This translates to: ""...many treasures were found, including items that were believed to accompany him (Tutankhamun) in the afterlife, **and items for his father.**""

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that items for his father were found in the tomb.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara Vancouver shara gaw bu hkawm manu-myit tsang taw ai bu hkawm masha ni a matu ra sharawng na lam yawm dik rai? ","The correct answer is **C: Bowen Zinlawng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bowen shara gaw lani mi hkrum lam hta mying grai kaba ai re dai nrai bungli pat ai shani hta kayaking jawn ai, bum lung ai, gat mari ai, lung sha seng hte laga ni nga ai re."" This translates to: ""Bowen Island is a beautiful place to go kayaking, hiking, swimming, and relax. It's a great place to spend time.""  The question asks for a place *near* Vancouver that offers beautiful scenery. Bowen Island is specifically described as beautiful and having recreational activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Granville Zunlawng (Granville Island):** The passage mentions Granville Island, but only as a place to see from the water (""Vancouver mare kaw na Granville zimlom na tau hkrau shajin na mai rawt sa ai re""). It doesn’t describe it as a scenic destination *in itself*.
* **B: Panglai makau hku hkan nna lamu htingwung de hkrun lam:** This refers to a challenging hiking trail – not a general scenic place.
* **D: Whistler:** While scenic, Whistler is described as being 1.5 hours away from Vancouver, making it less directly ""near"" Vancouver than Bowen Island.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara shara gaw mai byin na lam tsaw dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: Whistler**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whistler (Vancouver kaw na hking hkum 1.5 ram gau ai) gaw manu hpu ai raitim 2010 Kashung ta Oylmpic a majaw mying gumhkawng nga ai.""  This translates to: ""Whistler (about 1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is a famous place that hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics.""

The question asks about a place that hosted the Olympics. Whistler is the only option mentioned as having hosted the Olympics.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni hku nna dingbai dingna n jaw ai ningmu ni hpe tam taw yang Hka Rum ni de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shata man shi langai kaw na shata man masum du hkra** (Both dry and wet seasons).

Here's why:

The passage describes the Hka Rum (likely a river) experiencing both high and low water levels:

*  ""...dai hka rum yan gaw madung myit shang sha shara re..."" (During the rainy season, the river rises)
* ""...raitim ndai sumtsan manam mying kaba shara gaw loi na na nga na matu yu chyai shara law la ai..."" (During the dry season, the river becomes shallow)
*  ""...hka shadang grau jaw wa na ra ai hte Mangai ta hta gaw grau hkamsha pyaw na ra ai."" (The water level rises in the summer and falls in the winter).

Therefore, the Hka Rum experiences both dry (shata man masum) and wet (shata man shi langai) seasons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mungdan bu hkawm masha ni law ai du hkra ladaw laman:** This refers to the areas around Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana, not a characteristic of the river itself.
* **C: hka shadang tsaw taw ai shaloi:**  While the river fluctuates, it doesn't just 'flow quickly' - it experiences distinct seasons.
* **D: lanam ta shinggan de:** This translates to 'only winter' and is incorrect, as the passage clearly states the river changes in the summer as well.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Victoria Hka rum ni de Shata man shi langai hte shata man masum lapran sa du bu hkawm na matu kaja ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hka rum a dingbai dingna n jaw ai ningmu ni** (The story clearly states the purpose of the trip).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the reason for the trip:** The passage begins by saying Victoria Falls is a beautiful place, and the author went with family to see it, visiting Livingstone in Zambia and Makau in Botswana along the way. The whole passage *is* about the experience of visiting Victoria Falls and the surrounding areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mungdan bu hkawm masha kaji kajaw sha nga ai:** (The trip was to see the countries) - While they *visited* Zambia and Botswana, the primary focus isn't on the countries themselves, but on seeing Victoria Falls.
* **C: Hka rum a law dik ai ningmu ni:** (The story is about the beauty of the waterfall) - While the waterfall is described as beautiful, the story is more about *the trip* to see it, not just the waterfall's inherent beauty.
* **D: lanam ta hpe koi yen lu ai:** (The story is about what the author learned) -  There's a reflection on the experience, but it's not a core lesson or learning presented.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, sumla hkrung gayet na matu drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) jai lang ai shaloi lawu kaw na gara hpe madi shadaw hpaji n jaw da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: hpa hpe sumla gayet na ahkang lu ai hpe tau hkrau jep ai lam** (the way to understand how the sumla helped them).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how the ""sumla"" (leader/helper) aided people.** It details their efforts in providing resources, protection, and understanding their needs. The question asks about *why* the drone was used – the passage implies it was used *because* of the sumla's efforts and understanding of what was needed.
* **Option A** directly reflects this connection - understanding *how* the sumla's help led to the use of the drone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bungjat ahkang lu la ai lam** (the way it benefited the people) - While the drone *did* benefit people, the question is about the *reason* it was used, not just its benefits.
* **C: sawk sagaw jep ai ahkang ni** (the way it was just reported) - The passage isn't about reporting; it's about action and aid.
* **D: masha law ai shara, drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) hpe n mu mada ai shara ni kaw sha sumla gayet na** (the difficulty in getting the drone and how it relates to the sumla's help) - The passage doesn't focus on the *difficulty* of obtaining the drone, but on how its use was connected to the sumla's work.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) jai lang nna sumla gayet na matu gara shara gaw kaja dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) nga ai majaw myit sharu ai lam n nga ai shawa hpung ni makau hta.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the use of drones for surveillance and potentially harmful purposes.** It mentions drones being used to observe and record (""shawa hpawng ntsa hkan pyen hkawm ai gaw n galaw ging ai lam re"") which directly relates to ""majaw myit sharu ai lam"" (observing/recording things).
* **The question asks about the reason drones are being used.** Option A directly answers this by connecting the drone's use to surveillance and potentially harmful observation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ayan sumla gayet na matu ahkang n lu ai shara ni kaw:** This talks about general support for someone, which isn't the focus of the passage.
* **C: drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) hpe nau n mu lu ai shamu shamawt masha law ai shara ni kaw:** This implies someone is trying to destroy the drone, which isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: tinang tau hkrau nna ahkang lu da ai shara ni kaw:** This refers to helping people who are in trouble, which isn't the context of the passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan shang lakmat galaw na matu mying chyahpan bang ai hte seng nna gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tinang gaw sa chyai ai ni nga ai shara kaw nga na rai yang, mying chyahpan n bang ra na re.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Laga lam hta, sa chyai ai ni nga ai shara a shin gan kaw nga ai ni sha mying chyhpang ra ai.""  This translates to ""In that case, if you shine your light on what is being asked, it will lead to understanding."" This directly relates to the question asking about understanding the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage *mentions* sharing knowledge and understanding, it doesn't state that the *mungdan yawng* (group/community) is doing that specifically.
* **C:**  This refers to a feeling of being overwhelmed or lost, and while alluded to in the passage, it's not the direct answer to what helps understand the situation.
* **D:** This talks about offering help, which is a component of the passage, but doesn't address the core question of *how* to understand the situation.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, mungdan bu hkawm masha ni hku nna shanhte a mying jahpan bang ai lam a matu sa du ra ai shara n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Masha jahpan hta ai rung ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulties and struggles (masha) faced by the people (mungdan).** It explicitly mentions ""masha jahpan hta ai rung"" (the difficulties they endure).  The question asks about the hardship the people face.
* Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: buga pyada dap (it's just a lie):** The passage doesn't suggest anything is a lie. It's a description of hardship.
    * **B: shanhte manam taw ai manam dap (it's a mind-setting mind):** While the passage *mentions* mindset, it's not the central hardship.
    * **C: buga laika sa rung (it's just a small difficulty):** The passage clearly indicates significant, enduring hardship, not a small difficulty.

**Therefore, option D directly reflects the core theme of the passage – the hardships and difficulties endured by the people.**



"
Kadai gaw bu hkawm ai shaloi dawjau galaw ai kaw na akyu n lu na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: manu law ai shata shabrai hpe tam taw ai marai langai ngai** (meaning: it is because many people are trying to fulfill their desires/needs).

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** discusses the problems arising from pursuing desires and ambitions (hkrum lam, hkawm let daw jau ai lam). It mentions being overwhelmed by these pursuits, getting lost, and ultimately facing hardship (""shata shabrai kachyi mi pyi jaw nga ai"" - leading to many difficulties).  The passage highlights the *driving force* behind these problems: people's desires.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: manang nnan tam na matu yaw shada da ai marai langai ngai** (because it's because people are foolish) - While the passage implies negative consequences from certain actions, it doesn't directly state people are foolish. It's about the *nature of desire itself* rather than a judgement of intelligence.
* **C: hpaji nnan hkaja na hpe tam taw ai marai langai ngai** (because people are trying to achieve goals) - This is too general. The passage isn't just about goals, but specifically the *overwhelming* and potentially destructive pursuit of desires.
* **D: gawk hte shat sha shabrai hta myit lawm ai marai langai ngai** (because it is because people are immersed in work and difficulties) -  While work and difficulties are *results* of pursuing desires, they aren't the primary *cause* discussed in the passage.



Therefore, **B** best captures the central theme of the passage – that the root of the problems lies in the widespread pursuit of personal desires."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, maigan kaw nga shaloi dawjau galaw ai gaw manu yawm bu hkawm masha langai a matu gara hku akyu jaw na rai?","The correct answer is **A: shata shabrai hpe galoi mung madi shadaw ya ai** (It just means to comfort and appease the spirits).

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** describes rituals performed to appease spirits (hkrum). It talks about offering sacrifices, making vows, and generally trying to satisfy these spirits to avoid misfortune.  The passage highlights the anxieties and fears driving these practices.
* **The Question (Q)** asks *why* these practices (appeasing spirits) are done - what's the underlying goal?
* **Option A** directly addresses this.  The rituals aren't about logic or reason; they're about trying to calm and satisfy potentially harmful spirits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai gaw law malawng bungli hkingjang de woi awn wa ai** (This is about a problematic debt that keeps coming back) - This doesn't connect to the core theme of spirit appeasement.
* **C: dai gaw kalang marang gawk hte shat sha shabrai hpe jaw ai** (This is about being careful and speaking truthfully) - While potentially related to ethical behavior, it doesn't explain *why* the rituals are performed.
* **D: dai gaw ningmu langai sharawt na matu karum ya ai** (This is about a dream feeling dark and foreboding) -  A bad dream might *prompt* someone to appease spirits, but it doesn't explain the overall purpose of the practice.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer as it directly reflects the central motivation described in the passage:  trying to appease potentially dangerous spirits."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Walt Disney Mungkan de bu hkawm lam a alak mi re ai ngu gara hpe sawn lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: bu hkawm hkrun lam yawng hpe Disney wang kaw aten htum ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ayang gaw Orlando nbungli dabang de sa, Disney manam jarik de mawdaw htee bai sa, dai kaw bat mi daram hkawm chyai ngut nna nta bai wa ai hku re.""  This translates to: ""It is located in Orlando, and people go to see Disney's attractions, and many people spend money there."" This directly points to Disney being involved in attracting people to spend money on attractions (bu hkawm hkrun lam).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nampan sun ni hpe sawk sagawn na matu bat mi aten htum ai** (things that are not easily accessible and difficult to understand) - The passage doesn't discuss accessibility or difficulty of understanding.
* **B: site-shinggan manam dap kaw nga ai lam** (things related to online shopping) - While the passage mentions eBay and Craigslist, it's about *reselling* items, not Disney's core business.
* **D: pyenli daru kaw na manam dap du hkra mawdaw jaw ai** (things that are easily available for everyday use) - Disney attractions aren’t everyday items.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Walt Disney Mungkan hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: shani maga-law law lakmat ni auction internet laika man hkan mai mu ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Manu shingjawng dut ai website ni re nga ai online ntsa eBay (sh) Craigslist kaw na dut ai lakmat ni gaw shani mga law law dut da ai ni re."" This directly translates to: ""Various websites are available online such as eBay and Craigslist where various items are auctioned.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions people buying things, it doesn’t focus on *what* they're buying specifically, only that it's related to Disney.
* **B:** The passage mentions websites, but doesn’t say they *display* things, only that items are *sold* on them.
* **C:** This is not directly stated in the passage. It's an inference, but not the primary focus of the text.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara manghkang gaw hpaji ninghkrin shaman shakyang tsang (sh) laika shabra ai ni kaw sharin ya na matu n mai byin dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: majan shara a matu alu tsu re ai lam** (the part about the company's shares).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on shares/stock (majan shara).** The entire passage revolves around discussing shares, how they're being shared, and potential issues with them.
* **The question asks what the sharing is *about*.** It's asking for the central topic of the sharing described.
* **Option C directly addresses this.**  It refers to the shares being discussed (""majan shara"") and the potential for a loss (""alu tsu re ai lam"" - potentially losing value).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nam mali hkrit hpa kaw na lawt lu wa ai lam** (the part about difficult/complex things) - While the situation is complex, it's not the *core* topic. The complexity stems *from* the share issue.
* **B: ningshawng tsi lajang lajin ai lam** (the part about difficult times) - Similar to A, this describes a *result* of the share situation, not the topic itself.
* **D: nan shang lawm hkrang shala ai lam** (the part about reading books and magazines) - This is a minor detail about how the person gets information, irrelevant to the main sharing event.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer because it identifies the central subject of the passage: the company's shares and the risks associated with them."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpaji gin hpan gaw hpaji ninghkrin shaman shakyang tsang hta sharin ya na matu byin mai dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: majan shara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is primarily about sharing information (""shara"") about a course (""majan shara"")** – specifically a Hostile Environment course. The entire text details the details of this course, who it's for, and how it's beneficial.
* The question (Q) asks what the passage is *mainly* about.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ningshawng tsi lajang ai lam (things learned from experience):** While the course likely *provides* learning from experience, the passage isn't *about* experience itself. It's about the course.
* **C: Nam mali hkrit hpa kaw na lawt lu wa ai lam (things that benefit from good relationships):** This is a potential outcome of the course (better workplace relationships) but isn't the central topic.
* **D: hpyen grup yin ni (group of people):** The passage mentions *who* might take the course (company staff) but isn’t focused on groups of people in general.



Therefore, **B: majan shara** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw mahkoi nsan nseng byin mai ai hka hpe koi yen na matu kaja dik ai lata hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: minit mi dang hka shadu shaprut na**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes a situation where the stream is clear, but there's sediment/dirt (minit) in it. It also mentions the stream getting shallower (law law) and the water level fluctuating.  The passage ultimately points to something disturbing the stream bed causing the sediment to stir up.
* **Q (the question)** asks what causes the sediment in the stream.
* **Option C (""minit mi dang hka shadu shaprut na"" - sediment and dirt cause the stream bed to be disturbed)** directly addresses the cause of the sediment being present – something is disrupting the stream bed, kicking up the dirt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: minit law law hka shadu shaprut na (shallow stream bed causes sediment)** - This is backwards. The sediment *contributes* to the stream becoming shallower, but doesn't *cause* the sediment itself.
* **B: hka ndum mari lu na (the stream is blocked)** - While something *is* happening to the stream, the passage doesn't mention blockage.  It focuses on disturbed sediment.
* **D: masat sa ai hkrit hpa lam ni a matu hka hpe dawdan masat na (erosion on the mountain path causes the stream to be muddy)** - The passage doesn’t mention a mountain path or erosion.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara gaw kungkyang hka hpung yawt ai ni na matu pyi n mai byin na ram re rai?","The correct answer is **A: panglai lungrawk mayan makau kahtep nna hpung yawt ai**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly states: ""Rip hka hpungtang ni gaw jahkring hkring **lungrawk mayan** dai hte bung ai hkan panglai kaw na hka lai ni kawng de lung nna bai yu mat wa ai lam re.""  This translates to something like ""The essence of the Kachin people is to always remember and cherish the traditions of their ancestors.""  The question (Q) asks *why* people remember the Kachin traditions.  The passage explicitly links remembering to the ""lungrawk mayan"" (ancestral traditions).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hka sung hta hpung yawt ai** (remembering due to sadness) - The passage doesn't mention sadness as a reason for remembering.
* **C: hka lam hpe ninghtan nna hpung yawt ai** (remembering by learning the ways) - While learning is implied, it's not the *reason* given for remembering.
* **D: hka leng ni makau hpung yawt ai** (remembering the language and culture) -  Language and culture are *part* of what's remembered, but the fundamental reason is tied to ancestral traditions (""lungrawk mayan"").



"
tinang gaw hka lam hta chyat mat yang hpa galaw ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: kaga lam de yaw shada nna hka lam kaw na pru lu na matu shakut u, ngut ai hpang panglai hka kau maga de ayan na zawn hpung yawt wa u.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes someone struggling with their identity and feeling lost.** They mention feeling like they don't belong (""hka hpungtang ni gaw jahkring hkring lungrawk mayan"") and are caught between different worlds.  They talk about the pressure to conform (""shara nkau kaw hka hpungrawt bai du wa ma ai"") and the difficulty of being true to themselves.
* **Option A directly addresses this struggle.** It says the person is lost because they are trying to understand where they truly belong (""kaga lam de yaw shada nna hka lam kaw na pru lu na matu shakut u"").  It then links this to a feeling of being pulled in different directions (""ngut ai hpang panglai hka kau maga de ayan na zawn hpung yawt wa u"").
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: hka lam hpe ninghtan nna lawan hpung yawt u:**  This suggests the person is fighting against their culture, which isn't the central theme. The passage emphasizes *feeling* lost, not actively *rejecting* a culture.
    * **C: kaga n bung ai maga de hpung yawt u:** This simply states they are lost due to their family, which is too narrow a focus.
    * **D: ntsa man lawu kaw na hpung yawt u:** This talks about being lost due to difficulties in life, again too broad and doesn't capture the internal struggle described.



Therefore, **A** best reflects the core meaning of the passage – a search for identity and belonging."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, numhkap langchyi na gara shara de sa du ai gaw rung pat bu hkawm ai na akyu rawng ai hkrun lam rai?","The correct answer is **A: Danube dingyang na mare langai**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** specifically mentions ""Danube a myit shang sha hpa mare hkan sanghpaw li hte hkawm chyai ai lam"" - meaning the Danube is associated with a place where ships pass and gather. This directly relates to the question asking about a place where ships gather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Erie Hkawng makau shara** - The passage mentions Erie Hka, but doesn't specify anything about a ""makau shara"" (harbor/port).
* **C: Rhine hka Masawn hta** - While Rhine Hka is mentioned, it's just listed alongside Loire Hka, not connected to ship gathering.
* **D: panglai hte tsan ai hka lam shara yawng makau hta** -  This option introduces elements not found in the passage (""panglai,"" ""tsan ai hka"").

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw dai shara hta bu hkawm ai num ni na matu hpaji jaw shiga n rai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: tinang a dinghku masat kumla hpe bawngban ai lam kaw na koi gam u**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the Sahara and Atlantic Oceans.** It mentions how something is ""measured from the Sahara"" and ""measured from the Atlantic.""
* **The question asks about how something is measured.**  Option A directly addresses this by talking about ""measuring from a specific point (dinghku masat kumla).""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:**  Talks about ""bung ai lam"" (accumulated things) which isn't the central focus of the passage.
    * **C:** ""kaprip kashoi re ja lung seng sumraw"" is unrelated to the passage's content.
    * **D:** ""ra rawng wa yang maja majan re hpe jai lang"" doesn't address the measurement aspect of the question.

**Therefore, option A is the most logical and relevant answer based on the information provided in the passage.**

"Laika hta tsun da ai shara ni hta npawt nna, num bu hkawm ai ni a matu hpa gaw karum shingtau ya ai shiga rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang a ningmu ntsa kaw sha tsap ai lam koi yen lu na matu htunghking nbung ai lam hpaji jaw ai hpe chye na u.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focuses on Migration/Movement:** The passage describes the movement of people (""dingdung de na lamu ga"") from Sahel to the Atlantic coast. It details the difficulties and dangers of this journey (""num ni gaw dinghku nde shi timung..."") and the reasons people undertake it (""lata jum ya ai zawn re ai ni"").
* **Option C Directly Addresses This:**  ""tinang a ningmu ntsa kaw sha tsap ai lam koi yen lu na matu htunghking nbung ai lam hpaji jaw ai hpe chye na u"" translates to something like: ""The reasons why people are leaving their homes and traveling, and the difficulties they face during this journey, are understood.""  This perfectly captures the core theme of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hkan nang hkan sa na n ra ai lam hpe matsing masat u:** This translates to ""understanding the reasons why people are fleeing their lands."" While related, it's too broad and doesn't mention the specific challenges faced *during* the journey.
* **B: tinang a dinghku masat kumla hpe shadawng matu ta chyawp kaba hpe sumraw u:** This seems to focus on hardships and bird deaths, a detail *within* the passage, not the central question of *why* the movement is happening.
* **D: n ra sharawng ai mabyin ni hta, la ni hpe galau jahkrat kau na lam hta ngang kang u:** This refers to observing the difficulties of the journey, but doesn't address the core *motivation* for it.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer as it directly relates to understanding the reasons *behind* the migration described in the passage."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masing gaw dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai wa hku nna laksan pat nhpai lang na matu mahkoi ra na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai hte seng nna nampan sun hta laksan rit kawp tara ni nga yang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulties and challenges faced by people trying to achieve their goals (sumla gayet).** It talks about obstacles, hardships, and the importance of perseverance.
* **The final sentences explicitly mention *rit kawp tara* (strategies/methods) being revealed through hardship and overcoming difficulties (*nampan sun*).** The passage states that understanding comes from experiencing these challenges.
* **Option D directly reflects this idea:** It states that learning/understanding (*laksan rit kawp tara*) comes from experiencing difficulties (*dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai hte seng*) and perseverance (*nampan sun*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: grai kaji ai dusat ni hpe sumla gayet yang:** This is too general and doesn't capture the key message about *how* understanding is gained.
* **B: sumla ni hpe hpaga yamga yaw shada ai lam na matu jai lang ai rai yang:** This focuses on the path to a goal, but doesn’t connect it to learning from hardship.
* **C: sumla gayet hkam ai dusat gaw hkrit gaya taw yang:** This says people who achieve goals are just lucky, which is the opposite of the passage's emphasis on effort and learning.

"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai ni a matu byin wa mai ai mayak ngu laika hta n tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: jahte tam chye ai dusat hte sumla gayet ang wa yang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nam kaw na dusat dumyeng ni gaw gaya chye ai (sh) jahte tam chye ma ai."" This translates to ""This current situation, the difficulties and challenges faced by the people, are not simply a matter of being 'like that' (jahte tam chye).""  The question asks about what the current situation is *not* about in relation to the difficulties. Option B directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: laklai ai dusat hpe tam ai** - The passage mentions addressing past difficulties (""laklai nna tsam ai dusat""), but the question asks about the *current* situation.
*   **C: ra rawng ai pat nhpai hpan hpe garan ginhka galaw ra yang** - This relates to promises and guarantees, which isn't the main focus of the passage.
*   **D: hpyen law ai shara kaw bungli galaw ra yang** - This talks about rules and regulations, which is not the core message of the passage.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw bum hkyet lam ni hpe dinghkren mawdaw gau ai wa na matu manghkang byin shangun ai lam yawm dik rai?,"The correct answer is **A: law htam dik ai mawdaw htinglet ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is feeling burdened and overwhelmed (""shawng myit yu ging ai"") by responsibilities (represented by ""hkyen"" and ""numri"").** They feel like these burdens are constantly weighing them down and causing them distress (""aten chyhkring sha hta di di hkrat"").  The passage ends by saying these burdens prevent them from living a peaceful life (""law malawng shaning tup"").

* **The question (Q) asks what is the primary feeling or consequence described.**

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: arut hkat ai n-gun yawm ai lam (a feeling of strong frustration):** While frustration might be *part* of the feeling, the passage focuses more on the *weight* and *burden* of responsibility, not just anger.
* **C: salu salat grai law ai lam (a feeling of poverty/lack):**  The passage doesn't discuss financial hardship.
* **D: ningmu atsam yawm ai lam (a feeling of sadness):**  While sadness may be present, the core issue is being overwhelmed and burdened.

**""law htam dik ai mawdaw htinglet ai lam"" (a feeling of heaviness/being weighed down) perfectly captures the central theme of the passage.**  The entire text revolves around the feeling of being burdened and the negative consequences of that burden on one's life.



"
Mungdan law law hta shang ahkum hkanse hte seng nna hpa gaw ding yang re mahkoi ngam na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: manu ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ngut nna ahkun manu ni gaw mungdan hte langai grai shai ma ai."" This translates to ""and the things in this world, things that are both good and bad.""  The question asks what is being compared to the good and bad things within the world (""mungdan law law hta shang ahkum hkanse hte seng nna hpa"").  ""manu ni"" directly refers to those things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: hkrang masa:** (crops) - While the passage mentions land, it doesn't focus on crops as the comparison.
*   **C: tinang gara kaw jawbang ai:** (things that cause trouble) - The passage discusses both good *and* bad things, not just trouble.
*   **D: wangtep ni:** (countries) - While United States and Canada are mentioned, the focus isn't solely on countries.

"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, tinang gaw sumtsan kaw bungli galaw taw ai, raitim kaga shara kaw dap daju ai rai yang, tinang a shang gumhpraw ahkum hkanse hpe gara kaw jawbang ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang bungli galaw taw nga ai mungdan hta**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nang sumtsan kasa sha nre yang gaw, mungdan shinggan kaw bungli galaw yang nang nga ai mundan hta hkan nna shang gumhpraw a ahkun hpe jaw bang ra ngu lachyum re."" This translates to something like, ""When you look at these things, the place where the people live and move is where the upper class/powerful people control things.""  The passage is *about* where power resides – within the communities where people live and move.
* **The question asks:** Where does the upper class control things?
* **Option C** directly addresses this, stating ""within the communities where people live and move"" (tinang bungli galaw taw nga ai mungdan hta).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tinang ayan na dapju ai shara shagu kaw:** This is too vague.  The passage doesn't focus on where things are simply found, but where power is exercised.
* **B: United States kaw:** While the passage mentions the US and Canada, it doesn't say power is *centered* there. It uses them as examples.
* **D: manu yawm dik ai shara shagu hta:** This translates to ""where people work"", which isn't the core point of the passage.  The passage focuses on where people *live* and the power structures within those communities.

"Mungkan Lamang hte seng nna, lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu gaw dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: madun ai rai ni gaw mungdan a labau (sh) htunghking hpe hpaw madun na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mungdan ga daga de seng nna Horticultural hte seng ai shaleng dan ai lam ni gaw nampan kasi madun ai lam, hpun kawa hte seng ai nampan sun hte hpun kawa ni hte seng ai galaw na lam amyu myu hpe madun dan ai lamang hpe laksan hkaja lai wa sai."" This translates to ""The land given for the Mungkan Lamang, including the Horticultural section, is land that was given for various purposes – planting flowers, planting trees, and for other related activities – and is land that is being utilized.""  This directly connects the land usage to the *labau* (allocation/giving) of land for the *mungkan*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hpaji lam hte seng ai madun ai rai ni kaw botanical ni hpe hpaw madun da sai:** While the passage mentions horticultural aspects, it doesn't specify that the land is specifically for a botanical garden.
* **C: lamang ni gaw shata kru ram na chye ai:**  The passage *mentions* the land is being managed with care (shata kru ram), but that's not the *reason* it was given.
* **D: mungdan hku nna shanglawm nra ai:** The passage discusses the overall purpose of the Mungkan Lamang, but doesn’t point to this being the reason the land was allocated.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Mungkan Lamang na hkrang tara (sh) Mungdan ga daga hte seng ai tsun dan ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **A: madun ai rai ni gaw mungdan a labau hte mungkan manghkang lahkawng yan hpe hpaw madun ra ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mungdan ga daga de seng nna Horticultural hte seng ai shaleng dan ai lam ni gaw nampan kasi madun ai lam, hpun kawa hte seng ai nampan sun hte hpun kawa ni hte seng ai galaw na lam amyu myu hpe madun dan ai lamang hpe laksan hkaja lai wa sai."" This directly translates to the idea that the reason for developing the Mungkan Lamang is to improve the livelihoods and economic well-being of the people (through horticulture, etc.).  ""Madun ai rai"" refers to the reason/purpose, ""mungkan manghkang"" is improving livelihoods, and ""mungdan a labau"" is related to the people's well-being.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mungdan langai kaw na shaning shagu lamang ni hpe lamang madu n mai galaw ai** - The passage does talk about the area being suitable for certain plants, but it doesn't say it *doesn't* help with growing things.
* **C: Lamang ni gaw shata kru ram na ra ai** - The passage mentions it's been mapped and planned, but not that it's only for research.
* **D: Lamang galaw na matu, mungdan yawng shang lawm ra ai** - While the passage mentions benefits, it doesn't focus on the entire area benefiting, but rather specific improvements.



"
Lawu kaw gara hpe galaw ai gaw dusat a htim kasat ai lam kaw na shayawm ya na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Chyahkyawn ni kaw na sinda 25 ram tsan nga na** (It costs 25 drams to wash the tray).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nampan sun hpe up hkang ai ni tsun ai hte maren tsap hte chyahkyawn zawn dusat ni hte yawm dik htum sinda ga/dawng lahkawng shadang 100 daram tsan tsan nga nna kaga dusat shazai ni hte gaw sinda ga/dawng lahkawng shadang 25 daram tsan tsan nga ya rit.""

This translates to: ""...and it costs 100 drams to clean the tray if you use soap, but it costs only 25 drams if you just wash it.""

The question asks about the cost associated with the tray, and option C directly states the washing cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manam pyaw ai tsi pawt hpe gun hkawm ai** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Campsite kaw na maza mala ni hpe yeng seng kau ai** - The passage doesn't mention campsites or anything related to them.
*   **D: Dusat ni hpe lusha (jinghpa) hte pat shingdang ai** - While the tray *is* cleaned, the passage doesn't focus on *how* it's cleaned, just the cost.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw nam dusat htim kasat ai lam byin shangun ai hpe laika hta n tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: N-gun ja ai sama**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a tray (nampan) is filled with various items (dusat) and then distributed. It mentions different amounts of money associated with the tray (100 and 25 daram).  The overall theme revolves around *giving* or *distributing* something. 

""N-gun ja ai sama"" translates to ""giving equally to everyone,"" which directly relates to the act of distributing the contents of the tray.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsan gang na lam hpe, hkang zing na matu n awngdang ai** - This talks about a path and something being blocked, irrelevant to the passage.
* **C: Dusat dumyeng hpe lusha jaw ai** - This mentions ""receiving"" something, but the passage is about *giving* it out.
* **D: Shinggyim masha hte nhkau chyap ai du sat ni** - This talks about specific qualities of the items (beautiful, fragrant), but doesn't address the core action of distribution.
