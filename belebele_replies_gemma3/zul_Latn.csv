"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iliphi icedo elingafanele lokudlala i-accordion ngendlela ephumelelayo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuze unyuse ivolumu, cindezela kakhulu indlela odlala ngayo amanothi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Khumbula ukuthi asikho isidingo sokucindezela izinkinobho ngamandla amakhulu ukuze kube nomsindo owengeziwe njenge-piano.""  This directly contradicts the idea that pressing harder on the buttons increases volume.

Let's look at why the other options are correct advice from the passage:

*   **B:** The passage encourages minimizing unnecessary finger movement (""zama ukunganyakazisi iminwe yakho ngokungadingekile"") to conserve energy.
*   **C:**  The passage recommends keeping your hand relaxed (""Qinisekisa ukuthi isandla sakho sixhekethile ngangokunokwenzeka"").
*   **D:** The passage says to use bellows with force and speed for more volume (""ukusebenzisa lokhu okungezansi okunamandla kanye nejubane eliphezulu"").



"
"Njengoba udlala i-accordion, ikuphi okungasiza ukuze unyuse ivolumu?","The correct answer is **A: Ijubane elengeziwe** (Increased speed).

The passage specifically states: ""Ukuze uthole umsindo owengeziwe, ensimbini yomculo ingositini, usebenzisa lokhu okungezansi okunamandla kanye **nejubane eliphezulu**."" (To get more sound, in the middle of the music in a bellows, use this below powerfully and **with higher speed**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amandla engeziwe** (More power) - The passage explicitly says *not* to press the buttons harder for more sound.
* **C: Amandla amancani** (Less power) -  This is the opposite of what's needed.
* **D: Iminwe enyakaza kancani** (Fingers move less) - The passage emphasizes minimizing unnecessary finger movement.



"
Kungani izithombe ezivela ku-thelevishini zincishiswa emaceleni?,"The correct answer is **B: Manje izithombe zicwgala isikrini sonke**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that overscan is done to ensure ""the image covers the whole screen"" on most televisions. This is why the edges are cropped – to make the image fill the available space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuvumela imibhalo echazayo** (To allow subtitles) - The passage actually says subtitles *can be cut off* due to overscan, not that it's done to allow them.
*   **C: Ukuvumela ushintsho olulula luqhubeke ngezinye izindlela** (To allow easy changes to continue in other ways) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ukunquma imibhalo echazayo esezansi kahlulu** (To cut off subtitles at the bottom completely) - Again, while this can be a *result* of overscan, it's not the *reason* for it.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izikinga ezilandelayo omunye okungenzeka ehlangabezane nazo uma eshintsha imuvi ayise kusimo se-DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Okwesikhashana susa imibhalo echazayo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that due to overscan when converting a movie to DVD, ""if the video had subtitles near the bottom, they won't be seen completely."" This means subtitles (which are explanatory text) are likely to be cut off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isithombe esingagcwali isikrini sonke** - The passage states overscan *makes* the image fill the screen, not that it won't.
*   **C: Isithombe esigcwala isikrini sonke** -  While overscan *aims* for this, it's not a problem *caused* by the conversion, it's the reason for the problem.
*   **D: Susa okusemaceleni** - This is what overscan *does*, but the passage focuses on the *result* of that (lost subtitles).



"
Belikuphi ibutho lase-British?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Bordentown**.

The text states: ""UJenene John Cadwalder wayezokwenza ukuhlasela kokulibazisa ngokumelene nebutho lamaBhrithani eBordentown, ukuze avimbe noma ikuphi ukuqinisa.""  This directly places the British troops at Bordentown.
"
i-Signature kabani evelayo encwadini?,"The correct answer is **D: UCharles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""isiphakamiso esibhalwe ngesandla sasayinwa uMongameli kaKhongolose uJohn Hancock futhi noNobhala uCharles Thompson..."". This means Charles Thompson signed the handwritten proposal along with John Hancock.

The question asks about a signature *on the document*, and the text specifically names Charles Thompson as a signer.  The other options are people who *received* or *read* the document, but didn't sign it.



"
"Kulezi zindawo ezilandelayo, iDunlap broadsides ifikele kuphi kugcina?","The correct answer is **C: eLondon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ikhophi yafika eLondon ngo-Agasti 10."" (A copy arrived in London on August 10th). This directly indicates that the Dunlap broadsides reached London.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: iNew York:** While a copy was *read* to troops in New York, the broadsides didn't *end up* there according to the text.
*   **B: Isitolo sokuphrinta sikaDunlap:** The broadsides were *made* at Dunlap's printing shop, but the text doesn't say they remained there. They were distributed.
*   **D: i-Independence Hall:** The document was *read* at Independence Hall, but again, the text doesn't mention it remaining there.



"
Amabutho kaColonel Stark bekakuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekupheleni kwenyakatho, ocingweni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Abantu bakaStark baya endaweni esocingweni olusenyakatho kwendawo yabenzi bamaKoloni."" This directly translates to ""Stark's men went to a location on a hill north of the colonial settlements.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Olwandle ekugcineni kwamanzi** - The text mentions the Mystic River and a small cove, but doesn't place the troops *on* the ocean.
*   **C: i-Nyakatho-Mpumalanga yasepennisula** - While they are north of the settlement, the text specifically describes a hill/ridge.
*   **D: Phambi kocingo** - They *created* a barrier (ocingo) and placed a ditch in front of it, but weren’t positioned *in front* of the barrier itself initially. They were *on* the hill.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ayingezelele nini ucingo amadoda kaStark?","The correct answer is **B: Ngemva kokuthi abaziwayo badlule istake**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""wayala ukuthi kungabi nodubulayo kuze kube yilapho abantu abavamile besidlula."" This directly translates to ""he ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed the stake."" This means the line was reinforced *after* the British regulars were in position beyond the stake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njengoba amakoloni abiza usizo:** The text doesn’t say they extended the line when colonists called for help.
*   **C: Ngesikhathi sokukhathala okuncani:** The passage doesn't mention anything about fatigue.
*   **D: Ngesikhathi amabutho acabanga ukuya phambili ezindaweni zawo:** The text indicates the line was extended *after* the opposing force (the ""regulars"") was already approaching, not before."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isikhathi lapho iChina beyinobudlova kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: Izikhathi Zombuso Ezinthathu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""IMibuso Emithathu kwakungenye yenkathi yegazi eliningi kunazo zonke emlandweni waseShayina yakuDala, izinkulungwane zabantu zafa..."" This directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as the most violent time in ancient Chinese history mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Jin Dynasty:** The Jin Dynasty is mentioned as one of the powers *during* the Three Kingdoms period, but the passage doesn't say it was the most violent time itself.
*   **B: Isikhathi sikaXi’an:** Xi'an is a location (a city/palace) not a time period.
*   **C: i-Han Dynasty:** The Han Dynasty existed *before* the Three Kingdoms period and is mentioned as the dynasty that the Three Kingdoms followed after. While there may have been conflict during the Han Dynasty, the passage specifically points to the Three Kingdoms as the most violent."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iliphi iqiniso lamabutho izintuthwane ezingena esikhathini senomadic?","The correct answer is **B: Umtapho wokudla kwabo kuncani** (Their food supply is dwindling).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ikoloni liqala isigaba sokuzulazula lapho ukudla okukhona kunciphile."" (The colony enters the nomadic phase when the available food is scarce.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phakathi nobusuku bayaphumula** (They rest at night) - The passage says they *move* at night (""amabutho ezintuthwane amasha ebusuku""), not rest.
*   **C: Benza izidleke lezo ezishintshwa ngemva kwenzuku ezingu-17** (They make nests that are changed after 17 days) - The passage says the upheaval/protesting takes 17 days, not the nest changes.  The nests are changed *daily*.
*   **D: Bamasha emini** (They march in the daytime) - The passage states they *establish camp* during the day (""amise inkampu phakathi nosuku"").



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, imuphi umusho uqondile ohambisana nalokho okwenzeka esidlekeni amabutho wezinthuthwane phakathi nesikhathi nenomadic?","The correct answer is **C: Bashintsha izidleke nsuku zonke** (They change camps daily).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Phakathi nalesi sigaba, ikoloni lenza izidleke zesikhashana ezishintshwa zinsuku zonke."" (During this stage, the colony makes temporary camps that are changed daily.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakha izidlele phakathi nobusuku** (They build camps at night) - The passage says they *arrive* at camps at night, not build them.
*   **B: Bamasha izinsuku ezingu-17 ngaphandle kokuphumula** (They march for 17 days without resting) - The 17 days refers to the length of the ""restlessness"" of the nomads, not continuous marching.
*   **D: Ngokwesikhathi esithile basebenzisa isidleke esifanayo** (For a certain time they use the same camp) - The passage states they *change* camps daily, directly contradicting this option.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuzoqubeka nakuba kukhona okungezelele kwezimpawu?,"The correct answer is **B: Izikhathi ezithile kwezigqi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amawashi endalo azivuselela amandla azoqhubeka esebenza emjikelwezweni okhululekile ngisho noma enkathini ongeke ukwazi ukuyicabanga."" This directly refers to the continuation of *specific timings within cycles* even under unusual circumstances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umkhiqizo okujikeleza ngaphakathi** - While internal cycles are mentioned, the passage focuses on the *timing* of those cycles, not the product of them.
*   **C: Izikhathi zezinto eziphilayo** - Too broad. The passage talks about timings *within* living things, not all timings related to them.
*   **D: Izigqi ezibhekiwe** - The passage explicitly contrasts these natural cycles with reactions to *external* cues.



"
Yimuphi umusho ochaza okuveza okuhlukahlukene kwesici se-phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** specifically refers to the existence of multiple different phenotypes within a population for a given trait. The question *defines* this as ""abantu ngabanye beveza izimfanelo ezihlukahlukene eziningana zesici esithile.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:**  The passage states this means *everyone* is the same for a specific trait – the opposite of what the question asks about.
* **Izinto eziphilayo (Organisms):** This is a general term, not specific to phenotypic variation.
* **Izinhlobo zezinto eziphilayo (Species):** This refers to groupings of organisms, not variation *within* those groups.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okunembile okuchaza izinto eziphilayo endaweni ethile?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The question defines polymorphic** as a population where individuals show multiple different expressions of a trait. This directly relates to the description of a population with varied traits.
* **Monomorphic (A)** is defined as the *opposite* – all individuals being the same for a trait.
* **Inani labantu (B)** (Population size) simply describes *how many* organisms are present, not their variation.
* **Izinhlobo zezinto eziphilayo (C)** (Species of living things) refers to the *types* of organisms, not the variation *within* a species.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kube isibonelo sendawo ezokuvakasha esingokwemvelo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuvakashela i-mnyuziyami yesayensi (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines natural tourism** as focusing on enjoying the natural environment – plants, animals, landscapes.
* **Option C, a science museum, is a man-made environment** focused on learning about science, not experiencing nature directly.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of natural tourism:

* **A: Ukugibela intaba ukuze sithole impophoma (Climbing a mountain to find a flower)** -  This involves being *in* nature, experiencing the landscape, and observing plants.
* **B: Ukuthwebula izimbali zasendle (Photographing wildflowers)** - This is directly related to appreciating and documenting natural flora.
* **D: Ukudoba izinhlanzi (Fishing)** - This is an activity *in* a natural environment (a body of water) and interacts with wildlife.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyisisekelo kwezokuthutha?","The correct answer is **A: Izindawo zokusebenza (Workplaces)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a daily commute *to* workplaces.  The entire scenario revolves around people traveling from rural areas *to* their jobs and passing others doing the same. The passage is highlighting how this commute, reliant on cars, is disrupting a natural balance. While the other options are mentioned, they aren't the *basis* of the transportation system described.

* **B: Izimoto ezizimele (Independent vehicles)** - Cars are a component *of* the system, but not its foundation.
* **C: I-biosphere ezinzile (Stable biosphere)** - This is what's being *affected* by the transportation system, not the system's basis.
* **D: Ukuziphendukela kwemvelo kwabantu (Human adaptation to nature)** - This is the long-term context, but doesn't define the current transport system.



"
Izinxeyana ezizungeza i-nucleus zinakuphi ukugcwaliswa?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Negative charge**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ama elekthroni anamandla kagesi angaphansi kweqanda ngenani."" This translates to ""Electrons have electric charges less in magnitude.""  ""Less in magnitude"" and being ""under the egg"" (a common way to describe negative in Zulu context) indicates a **negative** charge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: i-Positive charge:** The text says protons have electric charge, but doesn't say electrons do.
* **B: i-No charge:** The text explicitly states electrons *have* electric charge.
* **D: i-Positive ne-negative charge:** Electrons only have a negative charge according to the text.



"
I-Necleus yenziwe ngezinxenye ziphi?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-Protons nama-neutrons**.

The text explicitly states: ""I-nucleus yenziwe ngezinhlayiyana ezimbili - ama-neutron kanye nama-proton."" (The nucleus is made of two particles - neutrons and protons)."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyisibonelo se-five bit binary number?","The passage states a binary digit can only be 0 or 1. Let's look at the options:

*   **A: 1010** - This uses only 0s and 1s.
*   **B: 12001** - This includes the digit 2, which is not allowed in a binary number.
*   **C: 10010** - This uses only 0s and 1s.
*   **D: 110101** - This uses only 0s and 1s.

The question asks for a *five bit* binary number.

*   A: 1010 has 4 bits.
*   C: 10010 has 5 bits.
*   D: 110101 has 6 bits.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**."
Ingabe amadijithi aneziqu ezimbili kubuye kubhekiselwe kuwo ngokuthini?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-bit**.

The text explicitly states: ""kubhekiselwa kulezinombolo ngokuthi amadijithi aneziqu ezimbili noma – noma ama-bit, uma kusetshenziswa ulimi lwasejele.""  This directly links binary digits to the term ""ama-bit""."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekho emushweni okuyisisekelo okuzuzisa abafundi ekutholeni ulwazi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqaphela okukhulu kulokho okukuzungezile**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Futhi ukubhuloga """"kuphoqa abafundi ukuba babenokuqonda kakhudlwana ngezwe elibazungezile."""" "" (And blogging ""forces students to have a deeper understanding of the world around them."")

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

* **A: Ukuthuthuka emthethweni yelimi nekhona lokubhala (Improvement in language rules and writing skills):** While the passage *mentions* that blogging improves writing due to fear of criticism, it's not the primary benefit highlighted.  It’s a *result* of the increased awareness and engagement, not the core benefit itself.
* **B: Ukuncipha ehlukunyezweni otanga (Reduced classroom shyness):** The passage doesn't discuss shyness.
* **D: Isithakazelo esikhulisiwe sokuqubeka ufunda (Increased interest in continuing to learn):** This is a consequence of the engagement fostered by blogging, but the passage prioritizes the increased understanding of the world as the initial benefit.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo abafundi bangathola khona ulwazi lokubakhuthaza ukuba bathuthukise ikhono labo lokubhala?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukugcina isithakazelo ezilalelini zakho** (Keeping your audience interested).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isidingo sokondla isithakazelo sabantu abafundayo kushukumisa abafundi ukuba bahlakaniphe futhi bathakazelise"" (The need to feed the interest of readers drives students to be more intelligent and engaging). This directly links the motivation to improve writing to keeping the audience engaged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuqhubeka uphendula izinto eziku-inthanethi** (Continuing to respond to things online) - While responding is part of blogging, it's not the core motivator for improving writing as described in the passage.
*   **B: Isidingo esinamandla sokubalekela ukuxekwa** (A strong need to escape criticism) -  The passage mentions avoiding criticism as a result of having an audience, but it's not the initial driver for improvement.
*   **D: Isidingo sokusebenzisana** (The need to collaborate) - While blogging *encourages* collaboration, the primary driver for improving writing, as stated in the text, is maintaining reader interest.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazuzisi ku-asynchronous communication kwabafundi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ukufinyelela abafundisi ubuso nobuso noma kunini osukwini**.

Here's why:

* **Asynchronous communication** means *not* in real-time. The passage specifically states it allows students to *avoid* waiting for the next face-to-face meeting and instead receive ""almost immediate"" responses online.  Therefore, readily accessing instructors face-to-face is *not* a benefit of asynchronous communication - it's what it replaces.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits, as stated in the passage:

* **A: Ukusetshenziswa we-inthanethi njengomthombo** - The passage explicitly mentions the internet and the World Wide Web as tools for accessing information.
* **C: Amahora okusebenza akhululekile** - The text states it allows for ""flexible hours of operation"".
* **D: Ukulawula ijubane** - The passage highlights the ability to work at one’s own pace and control the flow of information.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo kwe-asynchronous communication okungakhululekile kwabafundi?","The correct answer is **B: Amahora okusebenza**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kunokukhawulelwa kwesikhathi okumbalwa ngethuba lamahora okusebenza avumelana nezimo."" This means asynchronous communication *is* limited by the working hours of those providing support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ijubane lokufunda:** The passage says asynchronous communication *allows* students to work at their own pace, not restricts it.
*   **C: Umthetho wezinto zokusebenza:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ukusetshenziswa kwe-inthanethi:** The passage states the internet *enables* asynchronous communication, it doesn’t restrict it.



"
Yini engavezwanga kulesi sigaba omunye angaze akuhlobanise nezinqaba zakudala?,"The correct answer is **A: Amatilongwe angumgodi (Moats)**.

Here's why:

The passage *mentions* moats (""...ukuhogela ukwesaba okuphuma ematilongweni angumgodi""), but doesn't *explain* them. The passage focuses on the *feeling* and *imagination* around castles, not the practical details of their construction or purpose. The other options (tournaments, chivalry codes, cavalry) are all elements described and associated with the general idea of castles in the passage.

The question asks for something *not* explained in the passage, and the specifics of what moats *are* (their construction, how they worked, why they were used) are missing.



"
Ikuphi okungashiwongo lapha kulesi sigaba okuvela njengomnuko noma umsindo ongaqamuka noma ikuphi kulamarubhi wenqaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Izinselo (Echoes)**.

Here's why:

The passage talks about *feeling* like you can hear the ""clashing of steel in frozen grounds"" and the ""whispers of fear"". These are auditory experiences - sounds - that the author is imagining when thinking about old castles. The question asks what *sound* could come from within the castle walls. ""Izinselo"" (echoes) directly relates to sounds bouncing within a structure like a castle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukulwa (Fighting):** While castles were *related* to fighting, the passage refers to *hearing* something, not the act of fighting itself.
*   **B: Uvalo (Fear):** Fear is an emotion, not a sound. The passage says fear is *felt*, not heard.
*   **C: Idili (Illusion):** An illusion is a visual trick, not an auditory one.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile i-Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: Kudingenkile ukuqiniswa okuncani ngenxa yokuthula kwezwe okungokwemvelo ngesikhathi kwakhiwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""When its construction began in 1480 by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defence was needed only against the minor raids of freebooters.""  This directly supports the idea that robust defenses weren't necessary because of the peaceful environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubukhulu bezindonga zenqaba bezicelwe Nkosi uHastings** - The passage doesn't say the *size* of the walls was requested, but rather that he began construction during a peaceful time.
* **C: Ukwakhiwa kwenqaba bekungakajwayeleki ngokwaleso sikhathi** - The passage doesn’t give information about whether castle construction was common or not at that time.
* **D: Yakhiwa ngendlela yokuthi ikwazi ukubekezela ukuhlaselwa** - The passage states the opposite – it wasn't built to withstand a prolonged attack. It was more of a grand house than a true fortress.



"
Yikuphi ukwakhiwa okujwayelekile kwezici okulandelayo ebekungagcatshwangelwa kwenqaba yeKirby Muxloe Castle okuchazwe lapha kulesi sigaba kwangaleso sikhathi?,"The correct answer is **A: Amafasitela amakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Amafasitela wayo wengilazi amakhulu... bezingeke zikwazi ukumelana nokuhlaselwa kwangempela isikhathi eside."" This directly identifies large windows as a feature not typically found in a true castle due to their vulnerability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isisekelo esakhiwe ngendlela ekungakwazi ukubezela ukuhlaselwa** - The passage doesn't mention the foundation.
*   **C: Ukuqiniswa okuncishisiwe kunamanye amanqama** - While the passage implies it's less fortified, it doesn't specifically compare its strength to other castles. It says it's more of a manor house.
*   **D: Izidonga ezincani** - The passage mentions ""izindonga ezilula"" (plain walls), but the key point is the *size* of the windows, not the walls themselves, as the main reason it wasn’t a typical castle.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuvezwe lapha okuzozuzisa umgijimi ukuze alungiselele isizini ezayo?","The correct answer is **D: Ukusebenzisa i-gym ukuze uvocavoce okhalweni kuyaphezulu** (Using the gym to strengthen the upper body).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ukuzivivinya kokuqinisa imisipha namathambo engxenye engaphezulu yomzimba"" (exercising to strengthen the muscles and bones of the upper body) as part of good preparation for the running season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukugijima i-cross country ngehlobo** (Practicing cross country running in the summer) - While the passage mentions running in unusual places, it doesn't specifically focus on cross country practice.
*   **B: Xila kakhulu ekubambeni ijubane njengoba ulungiselela umdlalo** (Focus heavily on maintaining speed as you prepare for the race) - The passage actually says speed becomes ""less important"" in the later stages of a mile, emphasizing endurance instead.
*   **C: Ukuhlula imizuzu emithathu yesikhathi** (Breaking the three-minute mark) - The passage focuses on the general preparation for running and doesn't mention a specific time goal.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okubaluleke kakhulu ngomgijimi oyi-first-class half-mile runner?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlakulela ukubekezela kune jubane (Developing endurance over speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""isivinini siba esingabalulekile kakhulu futhi ukukhuthazela kuba isidingo ngokuphelele"" (speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes a complete necessity). It then goes on to say a top half-mile runner, even one who can run it in two minutes, *must* develop endurance.  This directly supports the idea that endurance is more crucial than speed for this type of runner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukugijima i-cross country ngesikhathi sezinyanga zasebusika (Practicing cross country running during the winter months)** - While mentioned as part of training, it's not presented as the *most* important quality.
*   **C: Ukuqeda ngaphambi kwemizuzu emibili (Finishing before two minutes)** - This is a good time, but the text emphasizes that *even* someone who runs that fast needs endurance.
*   **D: Ukuhlakulela ijubane kunokubekezela (Developing speed over endurance)** - This is the opposite of what the passage says.



"
"Ngokuya komsubathi, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kwenzeka ngokuthi adle ukudla okunempilo kuphela?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuphila kahle okujwayelekile (A generally healthy life)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *only* eating energy bars won't make you perform well, but can *affect* the well-being of very young athletes. It then highlights the importance of balanced nutrition, hydration, and understanding energy bars *in addition* to a healthy diet. 

This implies that a healthy diet *already* contributes to a generally healthy life. The passage focuses on what *adds* to performance and enjoyment *on top* of a healthy foundation, not on what a healthy diet alone won't achieve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukusebenza okuthuthukile (Improved performance):** The passage says a balanced approach can help athletes *develop* their performance.
*   **B: Ukwanda kwenjabulo (Increased enjoyment):** The passage explicitly states a balanced approach can *improve* enjoyment.
*   **C: Ukusebenza okusezingeni eliphezulu (Peak performance):**  A balanced approach contributes to this, even if energy bars alone don't.

"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, ikuphi okulandelayo okungavunyelwe ekutheni abadlali abasebasha bathole injabulo kuzemidlalo?","The correct answer is **D: Ukugcina amandla wempilo ezingeni elifanene (Maintaining a balanced energy level)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""taking care of energy balance, practicing good hydration habits, and understanding the different characteristics of energy pills can help athletes improve their performance *and enhance their enjoyment of sports*."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukudla kahle (Practicing good eating)** - While good eating is important, the passage focuses on *energy balance* which is more specific than just 'eating well.'
*   **B: Ukungashintshi ekudlaleni ezingeni eliphezulu (Not changing in playing at a high level)** - This isn’t directly addressed in the passage.
*   **C: Ukususa ukoma ngokuphumelelayo (Effectively removing dehydration)** - While hydration is mentioned, it's part of the overall *energy balance* discussion, not the primary focus for enjoyment.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani umgijimi webanga elide angathenga ucezu lwemishini olubizayo?","The correct answer is **A: Into ethandwa umuntu siqu (Personal preference)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that athletes ""might feel they like a product even if it has no real benefits."" This directly implies that someone might buy something (even if expensive) simply because they *feel* like it will help, due to a misconception, rather than any proven advantage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kufakazelwa ukuthi inezinzuzo (It has been proven to have benefits):** The passage explicitly says many products have *no* real benefits.
*   **C: Izothinta kakhulu indlela abesebenza ngayo (It will greatly affect how they perform):** The passage indicates the opposite – many products have little to no impact on performance.
*   **D: Kunemibono eyiphutha ngemishini engabizi kakhulu (There are misconceptions about cheaper equipment):** While the passage mentions misconceptions, it's about beliefs surrounding *all* equipment, not specifically why someone would choose expensive options.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini edingakayo kumgijimi ogijima ibanga elide?","The correct answer is **C: Imishini encishisiwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that there are many flawed ideas about the gear needed for long-distance running, and that much of the product bought will have little or no effect on performance. This implies runners are often talked into buying *less* necessary equipment. It does **not** suggest they need a lot of gear (A), a strong athletic background (B), or a lot of money (D). It specifically points out that a lot of gear is unnecessary.



"
Ubani owathola i-nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: uBloch noPurcell**.

The text states: ""I-MRI isuselwa esenzakalweni sesayensi esibizwa nge-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), eyatholwa ngawo-1930 ngu-Felix Bloch (owayesebenza eNyuvesi yase-Stanford) kanye no-Edward Purcell (waseNyuvesi yase-Havard)."" This directly identifies Bloch and Purcell as the discoverers of NMR.
"
Kwakumuphi umnyaka lapho i-patent yokuqala yavunyelwa ukwenza i- medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Four years later a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world to be granted in the field of MRI.""  This refers to the 1970 discovery by Raymond Damadian, followed by a patent granted four years later, in 1974.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini abantu okumelwe bayiqonde ukuze bakwazi ukuchaza izenzo zabanye?","The correct answer is **B: Inhloso**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Phakathi kwalawa makhono, ukuqonda **inhloso** yabanye kubalulekile. Kusivumela ukuxazilula izindida ezingaba khona zezenzo ezingokoqobo."" (Among these skills, understanding the **intention** of others is important. It allows us to disentangle potential ambiguities of concrete actions.)

The example provided further illustrates this – understanding *why* someone broke a car window (to steal or to gain access after locking keys inside) is key to interpreting the action correctly. The other options are mentioned as things we can understand about others, but the passage highlights *intention* as crucial for explaining actions."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuqonda i-intention kuzosiza abantu ukuba benze ini?","The correct answer is **A: Susa ukungaqiniseki ekwenzeni izinto**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding intention ""allows us to unravel potential ambiguities of concrete actions."" The example given – breaking a car window – illustrates this perfectly. Without knowing the *intention* (whether it's theft or trying to get into one's own locked car), the action is ambiguous.  Understanding the intention removes that uncertainty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bikezela izifiso (Predict desires):** While understanding intention can *inform* your understanding of desires, it's not the primary benefit stated in the passage.
* **C: Bheka abanye ngaphandle kokubahlulela (Look at others without judging them):** The passage doesn’t focus on avoiding judgment, but on accurate interpretation.
* **D: Funda iziqgondo zabanye (Read other minds):** The passage speaks to understanding intentions as part of a broader ability to understand others, but it's not simply about “reading minds.” It's about correctly interpreting *actions* based on probable intentions.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okunembile ngenhloso enkulu ka-AI?","The correct answer is **D: Umsebenzi ozihlelayo** (Automated tasks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""robotics research involves making machines do tasks *automatically* that require human thinking."" This directly supports the idea that a primary goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks on their own, without direct human intervention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukukwenza amalungiselelo** (Making arrangements) - While AI *can* be used for scheduling (mentioned in the passage), it's only *one* application, not the overall goal.
*   **B: Ukuzwa izwi** (Voice recognition) - This is *a capability* of AI, but not the primary goal.
*   **C: Ukuhlela** (Planning) - Again, planning is something AI can do, but it's a component of achieving automated tasks, not the goal itself.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, esikhathini esinengi ikuphi okulandelayo okuhlotshaniswa ne-AI?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlela okuhlelekile**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""ukuhlela nokwenza isheduli"" (planning and scheduling) as an example of what AI is capable of.  While the other options are mentioned in connection with AI, they are not as directly linked as planning/scheduling is.

*   **A: Insizakalo yekhasimende** - AI is used to *answer* customer questions, but planning isn’t specifically mentioned.
*   **C: Isayensi engaqinisekisiwe** - The text describes AI *as* a science, not something related to unconfirmed science.
*   **D: Ubona lokho okubhalwe ngesandla** - The text mentions ""okuqaphela ngesandla"" (hand recognition) as an AI capability, but it’s not as central as planning.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyinxenye enamandla kumuntu ohlezi anemicabango yokuhlangana?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuqaphela izimpendulo ezinembile enkingeni (Recognizing the correct answers to a problem)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a key characteristic of this type of thinking is that ""there is only one correct answer.""  The ability to identify that *single* correct answer is therefore a core strength.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ukusebenzisa izindlela ezintja ekuxazulula ikinga (Using old methods to solve a problem):** The passage mentions ""reusing existing methods"", but that's not the *most* central aspect. It's part of the process, not the defining strength.
*   **C: Ukuthatha isikhathi ukuxazulula ikinga (Taking time to solve a problem):** The passage emphasizes speed, precision, and logic - suggesting efficiency rather than just taking time.
*   **D: Ukukhumbula amaphethini (Remembering patterns):**  While the passage mentions the ability to ""grasp imagery,"" the focus is on logical deduction and arriving at the *correct* answer, not just pattern recognition.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kucatshangelwa kumuntu oneqgondo ethanda ukuhlanganisa abantu?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuthatha siskhathi sakho (Taking your time)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes **speed, logic, and accuracy** as key to this type of thinking. Someone who thinks in this way is focused on efficiency and finding the *correct* answer quickly.  ""Taking your time"" is the opposite of this approach.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Ukuqonda ukuthi kunempendulo eyodwa enembile (Understanding there is only one correct answer)** - This is a *central* tenet of the described thinking style.
* **C: Ukubona amaqiniso (Seeing facts)** - The passage mentions observing facts as a key component.
* **D: Ukubuthelela imimininigwane (Gathering information)** - The passage states the importance of accumulating information.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kucatshangelwe njenge-micro-expression?","The correct answer is **D: Ukunikeza imvume ngesithupha** (Giving a nod of approval).

Here's why:

The passage defines micro-expressions as *very slight expressions*, *minute facial movements that take seconds*. They are about subtle, often unconscious, displays of emotion.

Let's look at why the other options *are* likely micro-expressions:

*   **A: Ukushalazela amehlo njengoba ukukhuluma** (Eye darting as someone speaks) - Rapid eye movements can be a subtle indication of discomfort or deception.
*   **B: Ukusika ishiya** (Lip pressing) - A quick, involuntary pressing of the lips can indicate tension or holding back information.
*   **C: Ukucwayiza kaningana** (Frequent blinking) - Changes in blink rate can be a sign of stress or lying.

However, **D: Ukunikeza imvume ngesithupha** (Giving a nod of approval) is a *deliberate*, *observable* action, not a fleeting, subconscious facial movement. It’s a clear signal, not a subtle expression. Therefore, it would not be classified as a micro-expression.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaziwe okungelona iqiniso nge-micro-expression?,"The correct answer is **D: Kungakusiza uhlolisise uzwela**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *detecting deception* (lying) and understanding genuine emotions through micro-expressions.** It highlights the ability to read truthfulness even when verbal communication is difficult. It doesn’t mention that micro-expressions help you understand empathy or 'feel' someone's emotions better.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Ukuqopha kwamavidiyo kwenze izinto ezibalulekile zathuthukiswa** - The passage directly states video recording has led to important discoveries about micro-expressions.
* **B: Ukumusha okuqondile kungathola amanga** - The text explicitly mentions the idea that one can detect lies by accurately interpreting subtle facial expressions.
* **C: Inkulumo kuhlanganise nesimo sobuso kuyahumushwa** - The passage implies this by saying those with difficulty understanding speech can still understand truthfulness via facial expressions, showing non-verbal cues are being interpreted alongside any speech.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwaba okubalulekile okwaholela ekutheni kuvuselela izinto? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ukukhumbula umlayezo (Memorizing the text)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""...ukucindezeleka kwakungasahlali enkumbulweni yomuntu, kodwa kwagxilwa ekhonweni lokukhumbula umbhalo kakhudlwana."" ( ""...stress was no longer in the human memory, but was focused on the goal of memorizing the text more."" ).

This means that the key shift was from understanding and internalizing information (stress residing in memory) to simply *remembering* the text itself. The other options don't reflect this specific change highlighted in the passage.

*   **A: Ukuzicabanga komuntu (Personal reflection)** - Not mentioned as a key change.
*   **B: Ukuzungeza ulwazi (Surrounding information)** - While related to learning, it doesn't pinpoint the core shift described.
*   **D: Ukuzuza nolwazi (Acquiring knowledge)** - This is a general outcome of learning, not the specific change in *how* learning happened.



"
"Okuvezwe imiphumela okuvuselela, ikuphi okulandelayo okungagcizelwanga kakhulu?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuzicabanga komuntu (Individual thought)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *how* information is acquired, stored, and disseminated.** It talks about the shift from memorizing *content* to memorizing *where to find* content.  The passage directly mentions changes in how information is obtained, the pressure to memorize texts, and the impact on learning and dissemination of information.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ukuba nolwazi (Having knowledge):** The passage implies a change in *what* constitutes knowledge (moving from memorized facts to knowing how to access information), so knowledge itself is a central theme.
* **C: Ukukhumbula umlayezo (Remembering the message):** The passage explicitly contrasts memorizing content with memorizing *where* to find information (the source/text).
* **D: Ukusakaza ulwazi (Disseminating information):** The passage states the Revolution drastically changed the dissemination of information.

**Ukuzicabanga komuntu (Individual thought)** is the least directly addressed aspect in the passage. While changes in information access *could* impact thought, the passage doesn't delve into that consequence. It stays focused on the mechanics of information handling.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungakhuthazi ukusebenzisa i-inthanethi ukuze uqubeke nokuthandana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuxhumana nomndeni njalo (Regularly connecting with family)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""personal interaction"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as new motivations for internet use, identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998).  Connecting with family regularly directly supports these motivations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the answer, based on the text:

*   **A: Ezimayelana namabhizinisi (About businesses)** - The text doesn't mention business as a motivator for ongoing relationships.
*   **C: Ucwaningo lokuhamba (Travel research)** - This is a practical use of the internet (""learning"" as mentioned in the passage) but doesn't necessarily foster *ongoing* relationships.
*   **D: Ukuhlanga nabantu abasha (Meeting new people)** - While this *could* lead to relationships, the passage specifically highlights the value of *existing* and *ongoing* relationships.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi isikhuthazo sokusebenzisa i-inthanethi ukuzibandakanyeni komuntu siqu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukufaka ku-inthanethi izinxoxo zebhodi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions **""ukuhlanganyela komuntu siqu""** (personal involvement) as a new motivation for using the internet, as identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998).  Participating in online forum discussions (izinxoxo zebhodi) *directly* involves expressing your own thoughts, opinions, and engaging with others on a personal level.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ukubheka incwadi yokupheka (Looking up a cookbook):** This is information seeking, but doesn't necessarily involve personal engagement.
*   **C: Ukugcwaninga nomkhiqizo wokunakekela impilo (Researching a healthcare product):**  This is primarily information gathering for a practical purpose.
*   **D: Ukuhlela izimali (Managing finances):** This is a task-oriented use of the internet, again not strongly tied to personal involvement.



"
Kunini lapho intshonalanga Yurophu yayeka ukuthembela emathonyeni wokuphila yase iqala eyayo inkambo yokuphila?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva kweminyaka eyi-25 ye-Middle Ages**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Western Europe *began* to develop its own style *towards the end of the Middle Ages*, and that this happened after lagging behind the Eastern Byzantine style for 25-30 years. This indicates a shift *after* an initial period of reliance on the Eastern style.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngasekhupheleni kwezinsuku zakudala:** (At the end of ancient times) - The passage focuses on the Middle Ages, not ancient times.
*   **B: Ngesikhathi seByzantine:** (During the Byzantine period) - The passage specifically says Western Europe was *following* Byzantine styles initially, not developing its own during that time.
*   **D: Phakathi kweminyaka eyikhulu yesi-11:** (During the 11th century) - The passage says the lag lasted 25-30 years, and development started towards the *end* of the Middle Ages, which is a later timeframe."
Ukusebenza izinkinobho ukubopha izimpahla kwaveza miphi imiphumela? ,"The correct answer is **C: AmaCrusades**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the use of buttons to fasten clothing developed ""because of religious warriors"" – this directly refers to those involved in the Crusades. While the development happened *during* the Gothic period and the Middle Ages, and was influenced by Byzantine styles initially, the *cause* of the innovation is linked to the Crusaders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngesikhati seGothic** - This is when buttons *were used*, but not *why* they started being used.
*   **B: Isikhathi seByzantine** - Byzantine styles were an early influence, but buttons weren't a key feature of that style.
*   **D: i-Middle Ages** - This is too broad a timeframe. The passage is specific about the reason for the development.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo ocatshangelwayo okungaba isombululo ezinkingeni zemvelo?","The correct answer is **C: Ubona ibangena yekinga (Finding the root of the problem)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nokho, uma singafuni isisombululo sesikhashana, kumelwe sithole umsuka wenkinga bese sinqanda wona."" This translates to ""However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and prevent it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukunqaba ukunqumo zempilo ephezulu (Rejecting a high lifestyle):** While the passage implies that human development and consumption are *contributing* factors, it doesn't suggest rejecting a lifestyle as the solution.
*   **B: Ubushoshovu (Greed):** The passage identifies overpopulation and the destructive nature of humanity as issues, but doesn’t state greed is the solution.
*   **D: Ukuba umgani womnyakazo kwezinto eziphathele nezemvelo (Being a friend to environmental movements):** The passage mentions joining local campaigns as a *temporary* fix, but emphasizes that this isn't a true solution.



Therefore, identifying and addressing the underlying causes of environmental problems is presented as the most effective approach."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izinto ezilandelayo ekungeke zicatshangelwe njenge zinto ezingalapha izinkinga zemvelo?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuveza umbono ngezinqumo zempilo ephezulu** (Expressing an opinion on high-level policy decisions).

Here's why:

The passage argues that simply treating symptoms (like joining local campaigns or being activists to alleviate immediate suffering) isn't a *solution* to environmental problems. It emphasizes finding the *root cause* of the problems and preventing them.  

Let's break down why the other options *are* considered ways to address problems (even if the passage says they aren't comprehensive):

*   **A: Ukuba yinxenye yobushoshovu** (Being part of activism) - The passage specifically mentions joining local campaigns and becoming activists as an example of addressing the symptoms.
*   **B: Ukucisha imbangenla yenkinga** (Extinguishing the source of the problem) - The passage *advocates* for this - finding the root cause and preventing the problem. This is the preferred approach.
*   **D: Ukuphila endaweni enobuntu** (Living in a humane area) -  While not explicitly stated, living in a more sustainable and conscious way in your local area aligns with trying to reduce immediate suffering and build resilience.

**C, however, isn't mentioned as a way to *directly* address environmental problems.**  Expressing opinions on policy (while important for broader societal change) isn't described in the passage as a method for tackling the fundamental issues themselves. The passage focuses on *action* at the individual/community level or finding the *source* of the problems. It doesn't discuss the process of influencing larger political decisions.



"
Iliphi izwe lokuqala laseYurophu lapho indaba yalo yayixile ekulinganiseni kwamandla kuzenkolo?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the **War of the Spanish Succession** marked the *first* major conflict driven by the concept of the balance of power. This war was *about* who would inherit the Spanish throne, and thus how power would be distributed in Europe.  Therefore, Spain is the country whose situation initially focused the attention of Europe on the balance of power.



"
Iyiphi impi kwesinye isikhathi ichawe ngokuthi impi yenkolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Impi Yeminyaka Emashumi Amathathu**.

The text states: ""Ngakho, iMpi yeMinyaka engaMashumi amaThathu bekuzoba yimpi yokugcina ebizwa ngokuthi yimpi engokwenkolo."" (So, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war called a religious war)."
Ikuphi olandelayo okuthile kwesonto lamaKatolica okungazange kwaxekwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukugxila kakhulu egunyeni eSontweni** (Excessive focus on authority within the Church).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""lokhu kuqoqana kwamandla nemali kwaholela abaningi ekusoleni ukuthi lomgomo wemfundiso uyafinyelelwa yini."" This means people questioned whether the Church's teachings on wealth and poverty were actually being followed *because* of the concentration of power within the Church. The passage implies that the Church's authority and wealth were a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukube ukunikana kwencebo emaSontweni bekufaneleka** (Whether the giving of wealth to the Churches was justified): The passage *questions* the effectiveness of how the wealth was used, not whether giving to the Church was inherently wrong.
* **B: Ukube ukufundiswa ezinkolweni kumelwe kulungiswe** (Whether religious teachings should be revised): The passage doesn’t mention a need to revise the teachings themselves, only the *application* of those teachings.
* **D: Ukube ufundiswa emaSontweni kuyenziwa** (Whether teaching in the Churches should be done): This isn't a criticism raised in the passage; the issue is about the accumulation of power and wealth, not whether teaching occurred.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owabulawa eVersailles?","The correct answer is **D: Unogada**.

The passage states: ""Kunesikhathi lapho ilungu loquqaba lalifuna ukunqathuzisa ikhanda lonogada wasebukhosini obulawe eVersailles phambi kweNdlovukazi ethukile."" This directly indicates a guard was killed at Versailles."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwenziwa ngenkani eNkosini neNdlovukazi yayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuhamba okungalindelekile kweVersailles**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states** Louis XVI and his family were *forced* to return to Paris from Versailles. This means the move wasn't a sudden, voluntary decision on their part.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuvulwa kwamafasitela enxeyeni yesitimela (Opening the windows of the carriage):** The passage clearly states the mob *forced* the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
* **C: Ukubukela ukunqunywa kwekhanda kwakanogada (Watching the decapitation of a guard):** The passage explicitly states a mob member tried to show the Queen the head of a guard killed at Versailles.
* **D: Ukuhambo olubuyela eParis (The trip back to Paris):**  The passage details their forced return journey to Paris.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwaba umphumela wempi ekungasetshenziswanga kwamasosha empini yaseBritain?,"The correct answer is **B: Imikhumbi engasebenzanga yaphephisa engozini**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Britain blockaded Germany, causing dangers even to neutral ships.** This means neutral ships *were* put in danger, not kept safe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isifiso saseGermany ukusebenzisa indlela efanayo yokulwa impi** - The passage explicitly states Germany *expected* a similar response (using unrestricted submarine warfare) to Britain's blockade.
*   **C: Ushintsho lwenziwa emthethweni yezizwe** - The passage points out that the blockade violated international law established centuries ago, indicating a challenge to the existing rules.
*   **D: Izinto ebezidengeka kakhulu bezingatholakali lula** - The passage states the blockade was successful in removing essential supplies from Germany, meaning scarce items became harder to obtain.



"
Imuphi umusho ongaqinisekisiwe ochaza ukuvimbezela kwemikhumbi yezimpi yeBrithani kumaJalimani?,"The correct answer is **A: Iye yamelana nomthetho wezizwe**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""...this blockade broke international laws established by multiple international treaties hundreds of years old."" This directly indicates the blockade was in violation of international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iququzele isubmarine yaseGermany yokulwa** - The text suggests Germany *expected* retaliation, which *could* include submarine warfare, but doesn't say the British blockade *caused* it.
*   **C: Iphazamise ukuhamba kwezimpahla zamaJalimane** - While true (the passage mentions ""removal of supplies""), this is a *result* of the blockade, not a description of whether it was lawful.
*   **D: Iqinisekise ukuthi imikhumbi engahambi ngeke ilinyazwe** - The passage actually says the blockade *caused* dangers, even to neutral ships, meaning it didn’t ensure safety.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, kungafanela bani ukuhlolwa okunengi kweSclerosis?","The correct answer is **A: Owesifazane oneminyaka eyi-32**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""MS is a leading cause of neurological disease in *young adults and middle-aged adults*.""
*   **The passage also states:** ""Women are twice as likely to have MS as men.""

A 32-year-old woman falls into the young adult/middle-aged category and is of the gender most susceptible to the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umfana oneminyaka ey-15:** 15 is too young. MS typically affects young adults and middle-aged adults.
*   **C: Indoda oneminyaka ey-43:** While 43 is within the age range, men are less likely to develop MS than women.
*   **D: Intombazane oneminyaka ey-10:** 10 is too young for MS to be a primary concern.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, abahlanganyelo bomsebenzi othile badinga ukuba basekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Umbono ongafanele ngokuzwa ubuhlungu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Labo abazibandakanya emisebenzini evamile badinga ukusekelwa okwengeziwe mayelana nokuzwa ubuhlungu...""  This directly translates to ""Those who engage in normal activities need additional support regarding their perception of pain.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngenzani ngomhlana:** (What about the body) - The passage doesn't mention needing support related to the body itself.
*   **C: Ukugcindezeleka:** (Stress) - The passage mentions stress as a *factor* influencing pain perception, but not where support is needed.
*   **D: Uvalo:** (Fear) - Similar to stress, fear is a factor but not the area needing support.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ifencing idalwa njani?","The correct answer is **D: Ngokwendlela okusebenza ngayo kuhlanganisewe** (By how it's structured).

Here's why:

The passage states that fencing is ""fundamentally played as a competition system of fighting with weapons, one hitting the other."" This describes *how* the game is carried out – the core mechanic of a one-on-one competition. The other options refer to *where* it's played (university, Olympics) or its current state, not *how* it's created or structured.
"
"Ngokuya komusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okunamdla okuveziwe okungaba yishefu yangaphakathi?","The correct answer is **D: Incwadi kadokotela equkethe bodlela lamapilisi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a good indication of internal poisoning could be the ""presence of open medication containers or household chemicals that are poisonous."" A doctor's prescription containing a bottle of pills directly falls into the category of ""open medication containers"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuzizwa ngathi ungahlanza nokushiselwa** - While these might be symptoms *of* poisoning, the passage says the poisoning itself may not be immediately obvious. These are feelings, not physical evidence of a potential poison.
*   **B: Ukuhlanza nokujuluka** - These are simply common actions and don't indicate poisoning.
*   **C: Amajaqamba abuhlungu nokuzwa ubuhlungu esiswini** - These are symptoms *of* poisoning, but the passage is focusing on what *shows* someone might have been poisoned, not the symptoms themselves.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isinyathelo sokuqala esiqondile okumelwe usithathe ukuze uhlole isisulu?","The correct answer is **A: Beka indawo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**Ukuhlola umuntu ohlukunyeziwe, a kufanele kuqalauhlole indawo yesehlakalo ukuqinisekisa ukuphepha kwakho.**"" (When checking on an injured person, you should first assess the scene to ensure your own safety). 

This means the very first step is to assess the *location* or *scene* before approaching the victim.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungakanembi okukhuluma ngokuthi olinyaziwe kumelwe ahlolwe njani?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlolisisa indawo ngaphambi kokubheka olinyaziwe** (Inspect the scene before approaching the injured person).

Here's why:

*   The passage *specifically* states: ""**Ukuhlola umuntu ohlukunyeziwe, a kufanele kuqalauhlole indawo yesehlakalo ukuqinisekisa ukuphepha kwakho.**"" (When checking on an injured person, you should first inspect the scene to ensure your own safety.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukungakhathazeki kakhulu ngokunakekela ukulimala kwakho** (Don't worry too much about your own injuries) - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests; safety first!
*   **C: Bheka ukuthi olinyaziwe ukuphi** (Check where the injured person is) - While you eventually need to locate the person, it's *after* assessing the scene for safety.
*   **D: Zama ukubheka ukuthi azikho izinto ezisolisayo** (Try to look for dangerous things) - This is part of inspecting the scene, but option B is a more complete and direct reflection of the passage's advice.



"
Yiluphi ishintso olwenziwa iFrench Revolution okwaba nomthelela omuhle kubantu abasebenza kahle?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukutholwa kwemicabango yeRepublican** (The acquisition of Republican ideas).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""…ukusekeleni izimiso zoburiphabhuliki, ubuzwe kanye nenkolelo yokuthi izwe elabantu hhayi umbusi oyedwa."" (…supporting the principles of republicanism, nationhood and the belief that a country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.)
* **Republicanism** emphasizes civic participation and representation, which directly benefits those who were previously excluded from power. This aligns with the passage's mention of positions becoming open to all men who applied after the Revolution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukusekelwa kwesizwe okungezelelwe** (Increased national support) - While nationalism *increased*, the passage doesn't directly link that as a positive change *for working people*.
* **B: Ukususwe ukugxila ku-class kwayiswa ekuqedeni** (Removal of class focus leading to abolition) - The passage mentions opportunity being more open, but not the complete removal of class structures.
* **D: Indlela entjha yokukala** (A new way of measuring) - This refers to the metric system and isn't directly related to benefiting working people.



"
"Ukulandela iFrench Revolution, ukuphumelela kwamasosha nabanye ezengini elithile kwakusekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Izinga eliphezulu** (Merit).

Here's why:

The text states that after the French Revolution, positions were open to *all* men who applied, and that those who were ""most ambitious and capable"" (meaning those with high merit) were able to succeed. This is directly related to a system based on merit rather than birth or social standing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuphumelela (Success):** While success was the outcome, the question asks *what determined* success.
*   **B: Isitayela (Style):** The text doesn't mention style as a factor in advancement.
*   **C: Intshiseko (Enthusiasm):** Enthusiasm might be helpful, but the text emphasizes capability and ambition, which are aspects of merit.



"
Yimuphi umsebenzi womphakathi obangela ukuthi ungajabulisi emazweni athuthukile?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezokuthutha zomphakathi**.

The passage specifically states that people consistently complain about public transportation systems, and compares this to complaints about water quality or sewage systems - all public services. Therefore, public transportation is the public service being identified as a source of dissatisfaction in developed countries.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungathiwani ezokuthutha zomphakathi?","The correct answer is **C: Abanga izinkulumo ezingenig kulabo abawasebenzisa kakhulu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Cishe wonke umuntu uyakhalaza ngohlelo lokuthutha"" (Almost everyone complains about the transportation system). This directly supports the idea that the systems generate a lot of negative feedback from users.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zithanda kakhulu yiwo wonke umuntu ozisebenzisayo** (They are very loved by everyone who uses them) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage says.
* **B: Wona awekho mabi kangako ngokuya ngezinga lamanzi** (They are not so bad compared to the quality of water) - The passage uses water quality as an *example* of something people complain about at a similar level, it doesn't say transportation is better.
* **D: Akhululekile kulamazwe asethuthuke kakhulu** (They are comfortable in developed countries) - The passage states that even in developed countries, people complain about transportation.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okungaba nzima ukulinganisa ngenxa yezenso ezingakalindeleki kwabashayeli?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuhamba kwe-traffic**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ngeshwa, ukucwaninga ukuhamba kwezimoto kunzima ngoba imikhuba yabashayeli angeke ibikezelwe ngokuqiniseka okuphelele.""  This translates to: ""Unfortunately, researching traffic flow is difficult because the habits of drivers cannot be predicted with complete certainty.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isivinini se-traffic (Traffic speed):** While speed is *related* to traffic flow, the passage doesn't say speed itself is difficult to measure. It mentions speed as one of the three main characteristics *used to model* traffic flow.
*   **B: Ukuhlelwa kwendlela (Road layout):** The passage discusses how understanding traffic flow helps with *planning* roads, implying road layout is something that can be dealt with, not a difficulty in measurement.
*   **C: Ukusebenza kwezindlela (Road functionality):** Similar to road layout, this is an outcome of traffic study, not a reason why studies are difficult.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okusebenzayo uma uveza ukuhamba kwe-traffic ngokwezibalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuziphatha komshayeli (Driver behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngenhlanhla, abashayeli bathambekele ekuziphatheni ngendlela ecishe ifane; ngakho ukuminyana kwezimoto kuthambekele ekufaneni futhi cishe kungafanekiswa ngokwezibalo."" This directly links the ability to mathematically model traffic flow to the *tendency of drivers to behave similarly*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukusebenza kwezindlela (Road operations):** While important for traffic, the passage focuses on *why* traffic can be modeled mathematically, not how roads are operated.
*   **C: Umklamo wendlela (Road design):** The passage mentions road design is *aided* by understanding traffic flow, but it's not the basis for the mathematical modeling itself.
*   **D: Isisindo se-traffic (Traffic density):** Traffic density is *a result* of driver behavior, and one of the three key features used to model traffic, but not the foundational element for *why* it can be modeled.



"
Basebenzise ini uHershey noChase ukufaka iDNA? ,"The correct answer is **D: Amagciwane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""U-Hershey noChase basebenzise **ama-phages, noma amagciwane**, ukuthi bafake i-DNA yabo phakathi kwebhakithiliya.""  (Hershey and Chase used **phages, or viruses**, to inject their DNA into bacteria.)

While they *used* radioactive phosphorus and sulfur *with* the phages, the phages themselves were the vehicle for delivering the DNA.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Radioactive phosphorus:** This was a component they used to *label* the DNA, but not what they used to deliver it.
*   **B: Ufuzo lwezinto:** This doesn't directly relate to what they used for injection.
*   **C: i-Radioactive sulfur:** This was used to label the proteins, not the delivery method.



"
Ukwazi ukushintsha kwezakhi zofuzo bese kudluliselwa kwenye into ephilayo ukuze kwenzeke kuncike kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Uma amaseli angama seli wobulili**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo emagqamuzaneni wamagciwane kuphela okungadluliselwa ezinganeni..."" (Mutations in the genetic material of germ cells only can be passed on to offspring...).  Germ cells *are* the reproductive cells (sperm and egg – *amaseli wobulili*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Okumangazayo kwegenetic material (The wonder of genetic material):** While genetic material is involved, this doesn't explain *when* a mutation can be inherited.
*   **C: Uhlobo oluthile kwezakhi zofuzo (A specific type of genetic material):** The passage says it depends on *where* the mutation is, not *what kind* of genetic material.
*   **D: Uma ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo mazikwazi ukubanga ukufa kweseli (If mutations in genetic material can cause cell death):** The passage states mutations *can* cause cell death, but this is irrelevant to whether they are heritable. Mutations that cause cell death are *not* passed on.



"
"Ngokuya kolwazi olunikeze yilesi sigaba, ukuhlukahlukana nemiphumela kwezakhi zofuzo azincikanga kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Uma amaseli alimele ewobulili**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo emagqamuzaneni wamagciwane kuphela okungadluliselwa ezinganeni..."" (Mutations in the genetic structures of germ cells only are passed on to offspring...).  This means that mutations in other cells (somatic cells – which would include cells *not* in the reproductive system) *do not* get passed on. Therefore, the difference in outcomes of genetic mutations does *not* depend on whether or not the cells are reproductive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Okungakani okuthintekile kwe-genetic material (The extent of genetic material affected):** The passage *does* state that the impact varies based on what structures are affected.
*   **C: Ukuthinteka kwe-genetic material okumangazayo (The magnitude of the genetic material affected):**  The passage implies that the severity of the mutation matters, as some can cause death or cancer.
*   **D: Uhlobo oluthile lwezakhi zofuzo oluthintekile (The specific type of genetic structure affected):** The passage explicitly says the effect depends on *which* structures are affected.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwakungeson isizathu amasiko wasendulo agcine izimbuzi?,"The correct answer is **D: Basinikeza nethuba lokuthola ubisi**.

The passage specifically states that ancient cultures began keeping goats ""as an easy way to obtain milk, hair, meat, and hides."" While they obtained meat, the first listed benefit is milk (ubisi). Therefore, option D is the most directly supported answer.
"
Umgomo wegalofu ukuba uthathe inani elincani lani?,"The correct answer is **B: amaStokes**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the player who takes the *fewest strokes* to complete the course wins. A ""stroke"" in golf refers to each time the club hits the ball. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Amabhola (Balls):** The number of balls isn't the goal; it's how efficiently you move the ball.
*   **Isikhathi (Time):** There's no mention of a time limit in the passage.
*   **Izimbobo (Holes):** While completing the holes is the objective of the course, the *way* you complete them (with the fewest strokes) determines the winner.



"
"La kudlalwa khona igalofu, utshani busikwa kuphi kancani?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho kuhlaza khona**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""utshani olungasemigodini busikwa bube bufishane futhi bubizwa nge-green"" (the grass on the courses is cut short and called the green).  This directly links the cut grass (the ""green"") to the area around the holes.
"
Kwakuyini injongo yalolucgwaningo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukubona ukuthi izwe lisebenza njani** (To see how the world works).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umngomo oyinhloko wesayensi ukuthola indlela izwe elisebenza ngayo"" (The main goal of science is to discover how the world works).  This directly answers the question of the research's purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukususa okukodwa noma okuningana kulolugcwaningo** (To remove one or more from this research) - While critical thinking and testing *help* refine research, removing things isn't the *primary goal* of the research itself.
*   **C: Ukubuza imibuzo** (To ask questions) - Asking questions is a *part* of the scientific method, but not the overall purpose of science.
*   **D: Ukuhola ugcwaningo lwesayensi** (To lead scientific research) - This describes what scientists *do*, not the fundamental purpose of science.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini engasizi ukuze ihole ugcwaningo lwesayensi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuveza imibono yokuqaphelisisa** (Expressing speculative ideas).

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientific method ""directs much scientific research"" but also that ""speculation"" is part of it. It's *used* to generate hypotheses and guide research, but isn't the sole driver. It even says speculation helps to ""remove one or more good ideas"" - meaning it's a process of refinement, not just blindly following a set method.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yona yodwa indlela yesayensi** (The scientific method alone) - The passage explicitly says the scientific method isn't *the only* thing.
*   **C: Amathuba yokususa yokugcwaningisisa** (Opportunities to remove research) - This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.
*   **D: Ukwenza ugcwaningo** (Doing research) -  The passage implies research is the *result* of the process, not something that guides it on its own.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isitatimende esikhuluma ngesiphepho esinamdla kakhulu okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **C: Ezingi iziphepho ezinamandla zihlala amahora angaphezu kwemithathu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *two percent* of the most violent tornadoes last more than three hours. This means the *vast majority* (98%) do *not* last more than three hours.  Therefore, saying ""many"" powerful tornadoes last more than three hours is inaccurate according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **A: Iziphepho ezinamandla kakhulu zingakwazi ukumosha yonke into eziyizungezile** - The text says tornadoes can “devastate everything in their path,” which supports this statement.
*   **B: Iziphepho ezinamandla zihlasela izindawo ezincani kuzinye izinhlekelele zemvelo** - The text describes tornadoes uprooting trees, demolishing buildings, and tossing cars, indicating they are destructive like other natural disasters.
*   **D: Eziningi zeziphepho ezinamandla ziza nomoya ohamba ama-mile angu-300 ngehora** - The passage states that a large, rare tornado was travelling at 300 mph.

"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, yimuphi umusho oqondile ochaza iziphepho ezinamandla?","The correct answer is **D: Angakwazi ukususa izihlahla kusukela ezimpandeni zazo**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Izishingishane zisiphula izihlahla..."" (Tornadoes uproot trees...). This directly describes a powerful capability of tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngokujwayelekile sihlala amahora angaphezu kwamahora amathathu** (Typically last for more than three hours) - The passage says *2%* of the most violent tornadoes last over three hours, not that they *typically* do.
*   **B: Zenza imimoya ezihamba ama-mile ang-480 ngehora** (Create winds that travel 480 miles per hour) - The passage mentions a rare tornado reached 480 km/h, but doesn't state all powerful tornadoes do.
*   **C: Amosha izindawo ezinkulu kunezinye izinhlekelele zemvelo** (Devastate larger areas than other natural disasters) - The passage states they are confined to a small area *compared* to other powerful storms, so this is false.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okuqala okwenziwe abantu kusukela ngokhulu lesi-16?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukwenza isibonakude (Making telescopes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the *first real* telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century. It also says people had been using lenses to magnify things for ""millions of years.""  This means using lenses and magnification were happening *before* telescopes were invented. Therefore, making telescopes was the new thing that began in the 16th century.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukusebenzisa amalensi (Using lenses):** The passage says this happened long before the 16th century.
*   **B: Ukhulisa okubonayo (Magnifying things):**  Also happened long before the 16th century, using lenses.
*   **C: Ukwenza amalensi (Making lenses):** While important, making lenses predates the invention of telescopes. The passage doesn’t specify when lenses began being made.



"
Kusikhathi esingakanani lapho abantu bebesebenzisa amalensi ukukhulisa izinto abazibonayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka eyinkulugwane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abantu babenza futhi basebenzisa izingilazi ukuze bakhulise izinto ezibukwayo izinkulungwane zezinkulungwane zeminyaka."" (People have been making and using lenses to magnify things for thousands and thousands of years.) This directly translates to ""thousands of years"" or, effectively, ""millennia"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kusukela ekupheleni ngekhulu lesi-16:** This refers to when *telescopes* were invented, not when lenses were first used for magnification.
*   **C: Iminyaka eyinkulungwane:** This is also ""thousands of years,"" but the passage emphasizes ""thousands and thousands,"" making A a slightly better fit.
*   **D: Kusekela ngekhulu lesi-16:** This means ""since the 16th century"", which is also about the invention of telescopes, not the initial use of lenses.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, umhume kaMuhammad uchaza kanjani izinto zakhe zomoya namsiko?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthanda ukuthula nokuzihlukanisa** (A love of peace and solitude).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the isolation of the cave:** It describes how difficult it is to find, how secluded it is, and how little of the world is visible or audible inside. This strongly suggests Muhammad sought it out for peaceful solitude.
* **Focus on spiritual contemplation:** The text states he went to the cave ""to meditate"" and highlights his ""spiritual inclination."" Solitude is often a key element in spiritual practices.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Umsindo wangaphandle kungakusiza ukuba ucabange ngokujulile** (Outside noise can help you think deeply) - The passage explicitly states the *lack* of external stimuli in the cave.
* **C: Ubedinga isikhashana sokuba abe yedwa** (He needed a moment to be alone) - While true, this doesn't capture the depth of the spiritual *reason* for his solitude, as emphasized in the text.
* **D: Bekanovalo lokuthi uzobonwa nokuthi bazomuzwa** (He didn't care if he was seen or heard) - The passage doesn't suggest indifference to being observed; rather, it focuses on the deliberate *seeking* of isolation.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, insimbi yayisetshenziselwani ekuqaleni?","The correct answer is **D: Ojantshi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Initially, the flanges were likely designed to hold the rail. Over time, however, it was discovered that the rail could work better if it had a steel rim on top."" This clearly indicates the initial use of steel was for the rails (referred to as ""ojantshi"" in the text).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Crossties:** The passage doesn't mention steel being used for crossties.
*   **B: i-Wagonways:** Wagonways were the *system* using the rails, not what the steel was initially applied to.
*   **C: Amasondo:** The passage states wood wheels were used first, then replaced *by* steel wheels. Steel wasn't originally used for the wheels.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani amasondo wokhuni akhishwa kwafakwa wensimbi?","The correct answer is **B: Bacanga ukuthi asebenza gconywana** (They thought it worked better).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…kwabonakala ukuthi ujantshi ungasebenza kangcono uma ungaba nommombo wensimbi ngaphezulu."" (…it was discovered that the cart would work better if it had a steel rim).  This directly indicates the reason for switching to steel wheels – to improve performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bakhuphule ijubane lehashi** (They increased the speed of the horse) - The passage doesn't mention speed as a reason.
*   **C: Akwazi ukuthwala izinto ezisindayo** (It could carry heavier things) - While steel wheels *could* potentially handle heavier loads, the passage focuses on performance improvement, not specifically load capacity.
*   **D: Ebeqedwa insimbi endleleni** (Steel was being wasted on the road) - This is unrelated to the text.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini eyakha abantu ngesikhathi seRomanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Umumo womhlaba** (The shape of the land/place).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Esizindeni seRomanticism, **indawo ibumba abantu ngabanye**..."" which translates to ""At the heart of Romanticism, **place shapes individuals**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imithetho (Laws)** - The passage specifically contrasts the organic development of customs with ""laws imposed carelessly.""
*   **C: Amasiko (Cultures)** - While cultures *emerge* from a place, the passage says the place *shapes* people first, and then cultures develop as a result.
*   **D: Isiko (Tradition)** - Similar to culture, tradition is a result of the place's influence, not the initial shaper of individuals.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi umbono we-technological determinism? ,"The correct answer is **A: Umthelela wezobuchwephese ezinomthelalela ngayo emphakathini ziyalawuleka** (The impact of technology on society is controllable).

Here's why:

* **Technological Determinism** posits that technology shapes society, and its effects are largely *uncontrollable* and follow a natural progression. It suggests technology drives social change, not the other way around.

Let's break down why the other options *do* align with technological determinism:

* **B: Ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe akuxilanga kwezinto zamasiko** (Technological development is independent of cultural factors) - This is a core tenet of technological determinism.
* **C: Ubuchwepheshe kunomthelela ongokwemvelo emphakathini** (Technology has a natural impact on society) -  The passage states technology ""also has 'influence' on societies naturally."" This is a key idea of the theory.
* **D: Ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe akuxilanga kwezepolotiki** (Technological development is independent of political factors) - The passage also suggests technology development follows its own path, ""more than cultural or political influence.""

Option A directly contradicts the central idea of technological determinism by suggesting we *can* control technology’s influence. If the impact is controllable, technology isn't the sole, driving force.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi akuhlobene neze nokudonsa umnsalo?","The correct answer is **B: Umaka ofana ne-staple** (A mark like a staple).

Here's why:

The passage describes symbols for ""up-bow"" (like a V) and ""down-bow"" (like a short rectangle). It then goes on to describe *how* to execute those bows and the *sound* they produce. 

*   **A: Umsindo ophansi kamnandi** (A soft sound) - The passage specifically links the down-bow to a stronger sound, so this relates to bowing technique.
*   **C: Umsindo onamandla** (A strong sound) - This is explicitly described as a characteristic of the down-bow.
*   **D: Ukuqala lapho kunesixoxo khona** (Starting where there is a frog) - This describes how to begin a down-bow.
*   **B: Umaka ofana ne-staple** (A mark like a staple) - This is simply a description of the *symbol* used. It doesn't relate to the act of bowing, the technique, or the sound produced. It's just a visual representation.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't relate to *how* or *what* it sounds like when bowing is the description of the symbol itself."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuphi okulandelayo okuhlotshaniswa umsindo omnene?","The correct answer is **A: Umaka ophansi kumnsalo** (The lower mark on the bow).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""umnsalo ophansi wenza umsindo onamandla noqinile kakhudlwana"" which translates to ""a lower bow makes a louder and more forceful sound.""  The passage also describes the lower mark as looking like a rectangle or a square missing a side.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukudonsa umnsalo** (Pulling the bow) - This is simply the action of playing, not a specific mark or technique tied to a sound quality.
* **C: Umaka ofana neV** (The V-shaped mark) - The passage associates this with the *upper* bow and a ""cooler"" sound.
* **D: Ukuqala lapho izandla zakho zibambe umnsalo** (Starting where your hands hold the bow) - This describes the technique for the lower bow, but doesn’t directly relate to the sound.



"
Izinsalelo zamathambo ziveza ukuthi izandla zajwayela ukwenza muphi umsebenzi ojwayelekile?,"The correct answer is **C: Locomotion**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amathambo esandla okwembiwa eminyakeni eyizigidi ezimbili kuya kwezintathu ubudala aveza lokhu kuguquka kwesandla kokusetshenziswa kwesandla kusuka ekusinyakaziseni kuya ekusisebenziseni.""  ""Kusinyakazisa"" refers to locomotion – the ability to move from place to place.  The passage explains the hand evolved *from* being used for walking/movement *to* being used for manipulation.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ukuphathwa Kabi (Rough handling):** There is nothing in the passage about rough handling.
    * **B: Ukuthwala Okusindayo (Weight bearing):** While chimpanzees *do* bear weight on their hands while knuckle-walking, the passage focuses on the *evolutionary shift* away from hands being *primarily* for weight bearing.
    * **D: Uhambo lwe-knuckle (Knuckle walking):** The passage does *mention* knuckle-walking in relation to chimpanzees, but it isn't what the fossils reveal about the *initial* function of the hands. The fossils show a change *from* a locomotion-based function.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile isandla se-chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Zisebenza ukuthwala okusindayo** (They are used for carrying weight).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Isandla se-chimpanzee kanye nonyawo ziyafana ngobukhulu kanye nobude, okubonisa ukusetshenziswa kwesandla ekuthwaleni isisindo ekuhambeni ngamaqupha."" (The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, indicating the use of the hand in carrying weight while knuckle-walking.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aqondile kunezomuntu** (They are straighter than humans') - The passage mentions human phalanges are ""ukuqonda kakhudlwana"" (more angled/curved), implying chimpanzee hands are *less* angled, not straighter.
*   **B: Izandla nezinyawo kuyahluka ngesayizi** (Hands and feet differ in size) - The passage says they are *similar* in size.
*   **D: Zisetshenjiswa ukuzwisa ubuhlungu** (They are used for inflicting pain) - The passage doesn't mention anything about using hands for harm.



"
Ukukhetha kususa kuphi ukuhluka okusha kwe-genetic kwi-pool?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuveza okuthile**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukukhetha kuzisusa emehlukweni **oveziwe**."" (Selection removes from **expressed** variations.) 

Therefore, selection acts on and removes new genetic variation from the pool of *expressed* traits, not hidden ones.



"
Iyiphi into enomsebenzi wokugcwaliselela i-genetic variation?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo** (Mutation).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ukuguquka kwenza ukwahluka kwezakhi zofuzo okusha"" which translates to ""Mutation creates new genetic variation."" 
* The passage describes mutation as the *source* of the variation that selection then acts upon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuhlukanisa** (Segregation) -  Segregation is part of how existing variation is sorted, not where new variation *comes from*.
* **B: Ukuhlanganisa futhi** (Recombination) - Recombination *reshuffles* existing genetic variation, it doesn't create new variation.
* **D: Ukuveza okuthile** (Selection) - Selection *acts on* variation, it doesn't *create* it. It removes certain variations from the population.

"Ngokuya kwemininingwane okulesi siquphu, ikuphi okulapha okumelwe kudliwe uhlobo oluthile lwabantu ukuze kuxazulule ikinga “ye-protein”?","The correct answer is **C: Izinthethe**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Lapho zonke izinto sezicatshangelwe, akumelwe simangale uma okhokho bethu bazixazululela bona “inkinga yamaphrotheni“ ngendlela ecishe ifane neyezimfene ethafeni namuhla.""  And further explains that animals (like those in the passage) solve the protein problem by eating ""izintuthwane, umuhlwa, amaqanda"" - which translates to insects, larvae and eggs. This means our ancestors solved the protein problem through animal sources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amahlamvu afile (Dried Leaves):** The passage says plants are hard to digest without cooking and don't provide sufficient amino acids for animal-like digestion.
*   **B: AmaLegumes ahlaza (Fresh Legumes):** While legumes are a good source of protein, the passage emphasizes the *difficulty* of getting enough protein from plants alone without the ease of digesting animal sources.
*   **D: Isiqu sezimbali (Flower Bulb):** This is not mentioned as a protein source in the passage.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izikinga ezibalwe lana azibangeni ukungatholi okubalulekile kwe-amino acids?","The correct answer is **B: Ukungondleki kahle**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that failure to get enough amino acids from plants results in ""ukungondleki"" (malnutrition), as well as stunted growth and premature death. While the other options are mentioned, **malnutrition** is directly listed as a consequence of insufficient amino acids.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Izinkinga zokugaya (Digestive problems):** The passage mentions plants being *difficult to digest*, but doesn't list digestive problems as a *result* of low amino acid intake. It's a reason why getting amino acids from plants is hard.
*   **C: Ukukhula okugcindezelayo (Stunted growth):** Stunted growth is mentioned, but malnutrition is a more direct and encompassing consequence.
*   **D: Ukufa (Death):** Death is a severe consequence, but it's listed as happening *because* of the other issues (like malnutrition and stunted growth), not as a primary effect of simply not getting enough amino acids.

Kunganjani abantu be-subculture ngokwesinye isikhathi bagqamisa isizathu sokuba kuleli qembu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngokusebenzisa isitayela njenge ndlela yophawu** (By using style as a way of symbolism).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that members of a subculture often *demonstrate* their membership through a *distinct style* that *represents something*. This style includes fashion, behavior, and speech - all ways of visually signaling their affiliation and what that affiliation means.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngokuzama ukuzihlanganisa** (By trying to assimilate) - Subcultures often *resist* assimilation, they are defined by being different.
*   **B: Ngokuvumela izinkolelo zabantu ababazungezile** (By allowing the beliefs of those around them) - Subcultures often have beliefs *different* from the mainstream.
*   **C: Ngokuvumelana imithetho yomphakathi** (By conforming to societal rules) - Subcultures often challenge or reject societal rules.

"Ngokuya kwalombono ovezwe lana, kungenzeka ini kumntwana ophawulwe izimpawu zobandlululo okuhambisana nomcabango ojwayelekile ekuhileleni ekuziphatheni okuhambisana nakho?","The correct answer is **B: Umntwana kungenzeka aziphathe ngendlela engafanele.**

Here's why:

The passage states that children are aware of racial biases and stereotypes from a very young age, and these beliefs *affect how they behave*. The example given is of children of a minority group being primed with the idea they don't perform well in school, and subsequently performing poorly.  This demonstrates that a child exposed to negative stereotypes might internalize them and *act* in a way that confirms those stereotypes, even if subconsciously. ""Ukuziphathe ngendlela engafanele"" (behave inappropriately/poorly) directly reflects this potential outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Umntwana uzozama ukubalekela ukuziphatha kokweyisa (The child will try to avoid conforming behavior):** While some children might resist stereotypes, the passage focuses on the *impact* of the stereotypes, not necessarily resistance.
* **C: Umntwana kungenzeka azihlukanise nomphakathi (The child may isolate themselves from society):**  Isolation is a possible long-term consequence, but the passage focuses on the immediate behavioral impact.
* **D: Umntwana kuzokunqaba ukuhlanganisa nezinye izinhlanga (The child will refuse to interact with other races):**  The passage doesn't suggest avoidance of other races, but rather internalizing a negative self-perception.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ulwazi lomntwana alaziyo ngobandlululo okujwayelekile kungaba nomthelela kuziphi izinto ezilandelayo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuziphatha kwabo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""these inaccurate beliefs about race affect the way they behave."" It gives the example of children of a minority race who are *taught* they don't do well in school and subsequently *do* perform poorly due to this learned belief. This directly links preconceived notions about race to a child's behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Idlanzana lobandlululo akakhetha ukumveza ngalo:** The passage doesn't discuss what kind of prejudice a child might choose to express.
*   **C: Ubungani nezinye izingane:** While prejudice *can* affect friendships, the passage doesn't specifically mention this.
*   **D: Indlela abachazangayo uhlanga:** The passage focuses on how beliefs *about* race affect behavior, not how children define race itself.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kuhambisane nokukhulise komntwana oyisilwane?","The correct answer is **B: Amakhono anamandla wokukhulumisana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children raised by animals exhibit behavior *similar to the animal that cared for them*, including fear or indifference towards humans. This implies a *lack* of developed human communication skills. 

Let's look at why the other options are likely to be present:

*   **A: Ukuphila ngokuzimela (Living independently):** Being raised by animals would likely foster self-reliance.
*   **C: Ukuthambekela kokuzihlukanisa (A tendency to isolate):** The passage mentions fear or indifference towards humans, indicating social isolation.
*   **D: Ukuthuswa umphakathi (Social awkwardness):**  Again, a lack of human interaction during development would likely lead to social awkwardness.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuqondile okuchaza ukuphatha kwesilwane komntwana?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuziphatha okwesilwane okunengi kubangelwa ukungahlangani nabantu njalo** (Much animal-like behavior is caused by a lack of regular contact with people).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lapho ikhuliswe ngokuphelele isilwane ekungesona umuntu, ingane enobulwane iveza ukuziphatha (ngokulinganiselwa okungokoqobo) cishe okufana ngokuphelele nokwesilwane ebesiyinakekela, njengokusaba noma ukungabi nandaba nabantu."" (When raised completely by a non-human animal, a feral child exhibits behavior (to a realistic extent) almost identical to that of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to people.)  This directly links the animal-like behavior to *lack of human contact*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuziphatha njengesilwane kubangelwa ukuhlangazihlanganisi nabantu** (Animal-like behavior is caused by avoiding contact with people) - The passage doesn't say the children *avoid* people, but that they haven't had sufficient contact with them.
* **C: Ukuziphatha okwesilwane kubonakala kubantwana ebebavalelwe abazali babo** (Animal-like behavior appears in children who were confined by their parents) - While some feral children were confined, the passage says it also happens due to abandonment or being raised by animals, so this is too narrow.
* **D: Konke ukuziphatha kwesilwane kubangwa ukukhubazeka kwegqondo** (All animal-like behavior is caused by mental disability) - The passage explicitly states that some children are abandoned *because* of disability, but it doesn't claim disability is the *sole* cause of the behavior.  It also mentions children with no known disabilities becoming feral.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iziphi izinto ezingenzeki njalo esiphathelene ukulima kwasekhaya?","The correct answer is **B: Ukukhiqiza ukudla ukuthengilsele abanye** (Producing food to sell to others).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that subsistence farming is for ""producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family *only*.""  This directly contradicts the idea of producing a surplus to sell.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage states subsistence farming *is* focused on meeting the farmer and family's needs.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't say subsistence farming opposes advanced methods, it states it often uses simple methods like crop rotation and local seeds.
*   **D:** The passage mentions saving seeds, but not actively *giving* them to other farmers.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okunembile okuchaza ukwenza ezolimo kwasemakhaya?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhlelo lokulima okuphilayo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly defines ""ukulimela ukuziphilisa"" as farming for self-sufficiency** - producing enough food for the farmer and their family.  ""Uhlelo lokulima okuphilayo"" translates to ""subsistence farming system"" or ""livelihood farming system,"" which is the core idea described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isebenzisa indlela ehlukile yokonga izitshalo** (It uses a different way of saving plants) - While seed saving *is* mentioned, it's just one *part* of subsistence farming, not the defining characteristic.
* **C: Ivumela abalimi ukuba babelane izitshalo esigodini sonke** (It allows farmers to share plants throughout the garden) -  Sharing isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Kusetshenjiswa abalimi kwezinye izizwe** (It is used by farmers in other countries) - While true (the passage states it's common in developing countries), it doesn't *define* what subsistence farming *is*.



"
Ukuvakashela imnyuziyami kuwela ngaphansi kwasi isigaba kwezokuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwezokuvakasha zamasiko** (Cultural Tourism).

Here's why:

The passage states that cultural tourism involves visiting a place to learn its history and culture. A museum is *specifically* a place to learn about history and culture. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwezokuvakasha zamabhizinisi** (Business Tourism) - This involves travel for work purposes.
*   **B: Kwezokuvakasha zokuzijabulisa** (Recreational Tourism) - This focuses on entertainment and leisure, like beaches and amusement parks.
*   **D: Kwezokuvakasha zangaphandle** (International Tourism) - This simply means traveling to another country, but doesn’t specify the *type* of tourism. A museum visit could be part of international tourism, but it's fundamentally cultural tourism.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi into esemqoka kwabavakashi kwezokuzijabulisa?","The correct answer is **B: Baziphumuza ngalokho abajwayele ukukwenza nzuku zonke**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that recreational tourism is when people go to a place *different from what they normally do in their daily lives* in order to relax and have fun. Option B captures this essence perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** This describes cultural tourism, not recreational tourism.
*   **C:** While seeing important landmarks *can* be part of recreational tourism, it's not the defining characteristic.
*   **D:** This describes cultural tourism, not recreational tourism.

Yini eshiwo kulesi sigaba okuyinto enganciphisa uvalo lweshintso kumasonto asendaweni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukukhumbula ukuphumelela ekuziphatheni kahle kwezinto zamabhizinisi** (Remembering successes in past business conduct).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kulesi simo, ukukhumbula izimo ezidlule zokuziphatha kwezamabhizinisi kanye nempumelelo ebakhona kwasiza abantu bamukele izinguquko kanye nendlela entsha yesonto lendawo. Izindaba ezinjalo zempumelelo zanciphisa ukwesaba ushintsho..."" (In this situation, remembering past business conduct and existing successes helped people accept changes and the new way of the local church. Such stories of success reduced the fear of change...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuthola ulwazi kubantu abaqguqguzela isiko lequmbu** (Getting information from people who shape the culture of the group) - While understanding the history of people who shaped the culture is valuable, the passage *specifically* links success stories to reducing fear of change.
*   **C: Ukuqaphela ukuthola amandla kwaleqembu** (Noticing the gaining of strength by the group) - This isn't mentioned as a factor in reducing fear of change.
*   **D: Ukuqonda umlando kwaleliqembu** (Understanding the history of the group) -  Understanding history is important, but the passage highlights *remembering past successes* as the key to overcoming fear of change.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuzuza umando womuntu kusiza kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukunciphisa uvalo loshintsho** (Reducing fear of change).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Izindaba ezinjalo zempumelelo zanciphisa ukwesaba ushintsho, zibe zenza ukuthambekela okuhle oshintshweni lwesikhathi esizayo."" (Such stories of success reduce the fear of change, and create a positive inclination towards future changes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuqiniso okubalulekile** (Important truth) - While understanding history *provides* truth, the passage doesn't say its primary benefit is providing ""truth.""
* **C: Ukuthola ukunethezeka emhlanganweni** (Finding comfort in the meeting) - The passage is about understanding history and its impact on a community, not about feeling comfortable in a meeting.
* **D: Ukuthuthukisa ekuziphatheni kahle kwamabhizisi** (Improving business conduct) - While the passage mentions business practices, the main point isn't about *improving* them, but understanding them through historical context.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuqhaza kahle ngokunembile ipostmodern yokufunda?,"The correct answer is **D: Akukho umuntu ophelele ekufundeni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning is not about mastering a specific skill for practical application.** It points out how we consume information about things we'll likely *never* do (fixing cars, archaeology, etc.). This suggests learning isn't solely about competency, but about the *interaction* with information itself. This aligns with postmodern thought which rejects the idea of a single, objective truth or complete mastery.
* **Postmodern learning acknowledges the limitlessness and fragmented nature of information.**  The passage highlights the ""unlimited freedom"" in modern learning and the fact that there isn't ""just one thing a person needs to learn."" This fits with the postmodern idea that knowledge is always incomplete and contextual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukufunda komakade ebona kuzuzisa kakhulu kunabanye (Traditional learning is more beneficial to some)** - The passage doesn't compare traditional vs. modern. It speaks to the nature of *modern* learning.
* **B: Ukufunda kumelwe sigxile kulokho esinethemba lokuthi kuzokwenzeka (Learning should focus on what we hope will happen)** - This is about practicality and future application, which the passage *specifically* argues against.
* **C: Izindlela zokufunda zingcono kunezinye (Some ways of learning are better than others)** - The passage implies there isn't a hierarchy of learning methods; it's about the act of engagement with information, regardless of its practical use.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo akuvezi kahle ngokunembile indlela yamanje yokufundisa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ulwazi olungeke silusebenzisa kuyafaneleka ukuba lifundiswe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage argues the opposite of option D.** The author points out we often watch shows about things we will *never* do ourselves (fix cars, build wells, etc.). The passage implies that information we can't apply isn't necessarily valuable to learn.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Zinengi izindlela zokufunda (There are many ways to learn):**  The first sentence directly states this: ""Indlela yesimanje yokufunda inikeza inkululeko ezintweni ezingenamkhawulo. Ayikho indlela eyodwa kuphela yokufunda.""
* **B: Ezinye izindlela zokufunda ezibalulekile kumelwe zibekwe kuqala kunezinye (Some ways of learning are more important to prioritize over others):** While not explicitly stated, the implication is that focused learning (based on interaction and application) is more valuable than passively absorbing information.
* **C: Isipilliyoni sokufunda sixomeke kumfundi nelwazi elinikezwayo (The interaction of learning is anchored to the student and the information given):** The passage states: ""Ukufunda kudinga ulwazi phakathi komfundi nalolo lwazi olusuke lunikezwa."" This supports the idea of an interaction between learner and information.

"Ngemva kokuvuka ngenhloso phakathi nesikhathi sokulala, ikuphi okulandelayo okuzophazamisa isimiso sokulala?","The correct answer is **C: Ukucisha i-alamu ephezu kwetafula, nokubuyela uyokulala ngemva kwemizuzu eyi-shumi nambili.**

Here's why:

The passage describes *intentional awakening* as a method to disrupt sleep cycles and improve wakefulness. The goal is to *fully* wake up, even briefly, to avoid slipping back into deep sleep immediately.

* **Option C** describes exactly what the passage warns against – resetting the alarm and trying to go *right back* to sleep. This reinforces the sleep cycle and negates the purpose of the intentional awakening.

Let's look at why the other options are less disruptive:

* **A: Ukufunda ihora nenxenye ngaphambi kokuba uyokulala** - This is a pre-sleep activity and doesn't relate to what happens *after* waking up intentionally.
* **B: Ukuya endlini yangasese bese ubuyela ekulaleni** - Getting out of bed to use the restroom is a more substantial disruption than simply hitting snooze, it breaks the sleep cycle to some degree.
* **D: Ukuvuka uyophuza amanzi asebhodleni eliphezu kwetafula** -  This is similar to the method described in the passage (getting out of bed for a reason), and therefore wouldn't be as disruptive as falling *immediately* back to sleep.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungaqondile okuchaza ukuphazamisa ukulala?,"The correct answer is **B: Umgomo akuwona ukuthi kumelwe uvuke ngokuphelele**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the goal is to be roused *without being fully awakened* (""to rouse you without fully waking you"").  The intention is a brief disruption, not a full wake-up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ingasekelwa ku-biorhythm** - While the text mentions ""natural cycle"", it doesn't say the technique *is based on* a biorhythm. It's more about disrupting sleep to prevent deep sleep inertia.
* **C: Lokhu kwenzeka ngesikhathi sokulala** - This is true, but doesn't explain *what* the technique *is*. It's a description of *when* it happens, not the method itself.
* **D: Ngemva kokuvuka, umgomo ukuthi ulale phakathi kwamahora amabili** - The passage doesn't mention a timeframe for returning to sleep after being roused.



"
"Njengoba igqondo izama ukuveza amaphupho ngendlela ecacile, kuphakama ini?","The correct answer is **D: Isikhathi esiphakathi kweREM states**.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent lucid dreams (where you know you're dreaming) are linked to *increased* time between REM states. The author compares it to waking up every 20-30 minutes to watch TV.  This directly relates to the *duration* of the periods *between* REM sleep, not the REM states themselves, energy levels, or healing time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inani le-REM states** - The passage discusses the *space between* REM states, not the number of them.
*   **B: Amazinga wamandla** - Energy levels aren't explicitly mentioned as a consequence of more lucid dreaming.
*   **C: Isikhathi sokululama** - While REM sleep is important for restoration, the passage links lucid dreaming to the *intervals* between restorative REM periods, not the healing time itself.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungalimaza ukucacisa amaphupho emzimbeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuncishiswa kweREM ngobusuku** (Reduction of REM sleep at night).

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent lucid dreams *extend* the time spent in REM sleep, and that this can be detrimental because it prevents truly restorative sleep.  Therefore, the opposite – *reducing* REM sleep – would be a way to potentially mitigate the problems associated with too many lucid dreams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikunciphisa kwesikhathi phakathi kweREM states** (Reducing the time between REM states) - The passage suggests the problem isn't the time *between* REM states, but the *length* of REM states being extended.
*   **C: Ukuthembela emaphuphweni acazwe kahle** (Reliance on clear dreams) - The passage is discussing the *quantity* of lucid dreams, not the clarity of them.
*   **D: Ukungezelela kweREM ngobusuku** (Addition of REM sleep at night) - This would worsen the problem described in the passage.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, afana ngani amaqembu ahlangana ngokoqobo nalawa ahlangana kuzinto zokuxhumana?","The correct answer is **A: Amaqembu amabili alindele ukuthi adlale ngokwezinga elifanayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amaqembu abukeka njengangokoqobo aphathwa ngezimiso ezifanayo zobuhle njengamaqembu angokwesiko..."" This directly translates to: ""Groups that appear virtual are treated with the same standards of effectiveness as traditional groups...""  Essentially, they are expected to perform at the same level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage mentions virtual teams having *more* independence, not different levels daily.
*   **C:** The passage discusses a ""shadow team"" of managers each member reports to, not an unknown manager.
*   **D:** The passage points out that virtual teams can meet across different time zones, which is the *opposite* of working at the same times.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi siqephu, ikuphi okuveziwe okungelona iqiniso mayelana namaqembu abonana ngokoqobo nalawa ahlangaza ezinkundleni zokuxhumana?","The correct answer is **C: Amaqembu ahlangana ngokoqobo ukuzimela kwayo kuncani kunalawo ahlangana esinkundleni zokuxhumana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that members of virtual teams *often have more autonomy* than members of traditional teams. This is the opposite of option C, which claims traditional teams have *more* autonomy.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Amaqembu ahlangana ngokoqobo imihlangano yabo isezingeni eliphezulu** - The passage doesn't directly address the *level* of meetings, but it implies they are tied to local schedules, so it's not contradicted.
*   **B: Amaqembu ahlangana kwezokuxhumana ayisisekelo sokuxhumana nalawo ahlangana ngokoqobo** - The passage states virtual teams ""often serve as a communication hub for members closest to the real team,"" supporting this statement.
*   **D: Ukuhluka kwezikhathi kungazuzisa amaqembu ahlangana ezinkundleni zokuxhumana** - The text notes that virtual teams can meet according to differing local times, which can be beneficial.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi okuqukhethwe imibono akuxilanga kulokhu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuqonda ukuthi abantu bathandani**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *internal* drivers of change – needs and desires that are *within* people that develop over time. It also mentions how the environment influences *what* people choose to pursue.

Let's break down why the other options are related to the passage, but not the one it's explicitly *not* focusing on:

*   **A: Izifiso ezintsha ezithuthuka phakathi nobudala** - This directly aligns with the idea of internal desires evolving as people grow.
*   **B: Kubonisa ukuthi okuzungeze umuntu kungathinta izinto zakhe** - This refers to external influences shaping behavior, which the passage discusses.
*   **C: Izidingo zangaphakathi** - This is central to both Maslow's and Herzberg's theories, which the passage highlights.

**D: Ukuqonda ukuthi abantu bathandani** – While relationships and love are important human factors, the passage specifically focuses on *needs and desires as drivers of change*, not the dynamics of affection or interpersonal relationships. It doesn’t explore *why* people fall in love, but rather *what* motivates their actions based on internal and external factors.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungewona umthetho wesihloko sesithathu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwenza ukuphila namandla esithombeni (Making the image feel alive/dynamic)**.

Here's why:

The Rule of Thirds is about *composition* - placing elements within a frame to create balance and interest. It focuses on dividing the image and positioning key elements along those lines or at their intersections.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to the Rule of Thirds:

*   **A: Ukwakha isisekelo sokuthi isihloko sizohlala kuphi (Establishing where the subject will live/be placed):**  The Rule of Thirds directly guides *where* you position your subject.
*   **C: Ukugcina isihloko endaweni ekhethekile nesebenzayo (Keeping the subject in a special and effective place):** The points of intersection are considered ""sweet spots"" - special and effective places.
*   **D: Ukuba nohleleka esithombeni (Having order in the image):** The Rule of Thirds helps create a sense of order and visual balance.

However, making an image feel ""alive"" or ""dynamic"" is a broader artistic goal. While good composition (like using the Rule of Thirds) *can* contribute to that feeling, it's not the core definition of the rule itself. It’s more about impact and storytelling than the specific placement of elements.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungacazi i-35mm esithombeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Yayithathwe indela ethile yekhamera**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *size* and *aspect ratio* of 35mm film and how that relates to digital camera sensors.** It explains its dimensions (36mm x 24mm) and the resulting 3:2 aspect ratio.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isenziwa (It is made)** - The passage *does* state that 35mm is still made today.
* **C: Inesilinganiselo esihlukile kunamanye amafomethi (It has a different ratio to other formats)** - The passage states it's a standard ratio that many other formats match or approximate.
* **D: Ifomethi ejwayelekile emhlabeni (A common format in the world)** - The passage explicitly states it's the most common format.

Option B talks about *how* it was taken (with a particular type of camera), which isn’t the core of the passage’s description of 35mm. The passage is about *what* 35mm *is*—its physical characteristics—not how it’s used.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, njengoba abenzi bamalensi bakhuphula izinga layo, amalensi asondeza izinto eduze athuthukiswe njani?","The correct answer is **A: Ijubane lamalensi liphezulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lokhu kuvumele ukwakhiwa kwezibuko ezibonisa eduze ukuthi kuphinde kukhiqizwe olunye uhlobo lwezinga eliphezulu uma kuqhathaniswa nalezi ezinye.""  This directly translates to ""This has allowed the creation of close-focusing mirrors that also reproduce another type of higher quality when compared to others.""  The ""higher quality"" refers to a faster (higher aperture/lower f-number) lens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alula ukuwasebenzisa ezimweni eziphansi kakhulu:** The passage actually says the opposite - they struggle in low light.
* **C: Izinga lesithombe liyafana namalensi anokugxila okulungisiwe:** The passage says they achieve *higher* quality.
* **D: Anokugxila okuphansi kunamalensi ahamba phambili:** The passage describes an *improvement* in quality, not a decrease.

"Ngokuya kwalemininigwane elapha esigabeni, kunini lapho ilensi esondezayo ukusetshenjiswa kunama lensi aphuma phambili?","The correct answer is **C: Mawungafuni ukusebenzisa i-flash ezindaweni ezimnyama**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a drawback of magnifying lenses is that their *aperture* (the opening that lets light in) is generally small. This makes cheaper zoom lenses less usable in low light *without* a flash. Therefore, a lens that can open wider (a faster aperture, which is a characteristic of prime lenses mentioned earlier in the text as being superior) would be preferable when you want to avoid using a flash in dark environments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uma kuyimfuneko ukuba ileni ivuleke kakhulu** - While true that faster lenses open wider, the passage focuses on the *need* to open wide in low light, not just the capability.
*   **B: Mawufuna izakhi zamalensi amancani** - The passage doesn't discuss the size of lens elements.
*   **D: Mawufuna ukugxile okunengi ekunkimbinkimbini** - The passage doesn't directly connect lens choice to depth of field or focusing complexity.

Ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kunembe ekuchazeni i-Mysticism?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukugcizelela ekufuneni okuhlangabezane nakho komuntu siqu kungafaniswa nezinye izindlela zezenkolelo nokukhulukela.**

Here's why:

The provided text *specifically* states that mysticism is **distinguished** from other religions and worship practices by its focus on *personal experience* and altered states of consciousness.  Option D suggests that this focus is *similar* to other belief systems, which is the opposite of what the definition emphasizes.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A:** The text mentions that mysticism often leads to states of peace and joy.
*   **B:** The text directly states that mystics seek spiritual knowledge and truth.
*   **C:**  The text explains that mystics follow practices designed to enhance these experiences.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona ukugxilisa kwiMysticism?","The correct answer is **C: Ukucizelela kokuhle komkhumbulo (Emphasizing the goodness of memory)**.

Here's why:

The passage defines Mysticism as focusing on *direct experience* of higher realities, spiritual truth, or God, and cultivating states of being like peace, understanding, and joy.  

Let's break down why the other options *are* related to Mysticism:

*   **A: Ukufuna muzwa kwezinto zaphezulu ezenzeka ngempela (Seeking a feeling of real higher experiences):** This directly aligns with the passage's emphasis on direct experience of higher realities.
*   **B: Ukuphishekela ulwazi ngokwabelana, okuhlangabezane nakho kokwabelana (Striving for knowledge by sharing, shared experience):** While Mysticism is often a personal journey, shared experiences and learning from others can be part of the path.
*   **D: Ukuphishekela kokwaziswa kokuqaphela uNkulunkulu (Striving for awareness of God):** This is a core element of the passage's definition of Mysticism – the pursuit of understanding or connection with the divine.

However, **emphasizing the goodness of memory** has *nothing* to do with direct spiritual experience or cultivating inner states of being. It focuses on the past, whereas Mysticism is focused on the present moment and transcending ordinary reality.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu , ubani oqale ezolimo emphakathi?","The correct answer is **C: Abantu baseMaori babuya ePolynesia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The idea created a view that the Maori people came from Polynesia in multiple canoes and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society."" 

This directly states that the Maori, coming from Polynesia, were the ones who established the agricultural society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uMoriori ebuya eNew Zealand** - The passage suggests the Moriori *left* New Zealand, not returned to it to start farming.
*   **B: uMoriori obuya eChatham Islands** - They developed a distinct culture on the Chatham Islands, but the text doesn't say they initiated agriculture there.
*   **D: Izwekazi kubuya khona iMaori** - The passage does not state that people from 'izwekazi' came and initiated agriculture.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iqembu elazingela imoas bebabuya kuyiphi indawo?","The correct answer is **B: i-New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isikhathi eside phakathi namakhulu eminyaka eshumi nesishiyagalolunye kanye namashumi amabili, bekukholelwa ukuthi abahlali bokuqala baseNyuzilandi abantu baseMaori, ababezingela izinyoni ezinkulu ezibizwa ngama-moa."" This directly says the moa hunters (the first inhabitants) were from New Zealand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izwekazi** - While the text mentions the Maori originating from Polynesia, it specifically states the moa hunters were originally from New Zealand.
*   **C: i-Chatham Islands** - The Moriori *moved* to the Chatham Islands, they didn't originate there as hunters.
*   **D: i-Polynesia** - Polynesia is a broader origin area for the Maori, but the moa hunters were specifically from New Zealand.

Isiphi isimo esingavumela indlela ye-origamu yePureland izuzise ifolda?,"The correct answer is **D: Ifolda ikuzamile kanye noma kabili lokho** (If the folder has tried once or twice).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Pureland origami was *designed to help inexperienced folders or those with limited physical dexterity*.  Someone who is trying origami for the first or second time fits that description perfectly. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Pureland origami specifically *restricts* making multiple folds at once.
* **B:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about the folder's level of skill or ability.
* **C:** Pureland origami is *simpler* and avoids complex folding, unlike something that requires precise folds.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile iPureland origami?,"The correct answer is **D: Indlela efanelekile yamafolda okunekhona elincani lwezimoto** (A suitable way of folding that has a corner of cars).

Here's why:

* **Pureland origami** is specifically designed for people with limited motor skills. The description emphasizes *single folds* and *precise locations*.  A ""corner of cars"" has absolutely no relation to these principles and is a completely irrelevant statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iyenzelwe okuhlangane nakho kwamafolda** (Designed for encountering folds) – This is a vague statement, but doesn't *contradict* the description.  Origami *is* about encountering folds!
* **B: Lendlela ayinayo ukuhlehliswa kwamafolds** (This method has no deviation of folds) – The description *implies* precision, which means no deviation.  This aligns with Pureland origami.
* **C: Amafolds kumelwe abe nezindawo eziqondile** (Folds must have precise locations) – This is *directly stated* in the description of Pureland origami.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't fit with the definition provided."
"Ngokuya kwamomusho, iyiphi indawo engahlanganisiwe ne-Indus Valley Civilization?","The correct answer is **A: i-Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the civilization is *sometimes* called the Harappan Civilization *after* Harappa, which was one of the first sites excavated. This means Harappa is a *part* of the Indus Valley Civilization, not a place it doesn't include.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: i-Sarasvati River:** The passage discusses the possibility of calling the civilization the ""Indus-Sarasvati Civilization"" due to evidence of it existing in the now-dry Sarasvati River valley.
*   **C: Zonke izindawo ezise-nyakatho-mpumalanga zaseAfghanistan:** The passage specifically mentions that the civilization included parts of northeastern Afghanistan.
*   **D: Okunengi okwamanje kwaPakistan:** The passage clearly states that the civilization included much of modern-day Pakistan.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungashiwongo okungekhe kube ithuba legama leBronze Age Civilization okukhulunywe ngakho esigabeni?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Harappan Civilization**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some call it the Harappan Civilization *because* Harappa was the first site excavated. While it *is* a name used, the passage implies that it's a less preferable name compared to Indus Valley or Indus-Sarasvati. The other options (Indus-Sarasvati, Indus River, Indus Valley) are all explicitly mentioned as names for the civilization in the passage. Therefore, the passage doesn’t identify “Harappan Civilization” as the Bronze Age civilization, but rather as a name *for* it, derived from one of its earliest excavated sites.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo kumelela into ezuzisayo yesikhathi eside?","The correct answer is **A: Ukusebenzisana nabanye**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people will realize collaborating with others is the best choice *in the long run*. It contrasts short-term gains from being selfish (""umhawu"") with the sustained benefits of cooperation.  The passage champions the idea that those who choose collaboration will ultimately be better off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukubeka kuqala isifiso zakho** - The passage argues *against* prioritizing selfish desires (""umhawu"").
*   **C: Ukuqizelela ukuthi yikuphi okungazuzisa abantu abancani kunabantu abanegi** - This is about focusing on who benefits the *least*, not the long-term benefit of collaboration.
*   **D: Ukuqaphela ukuhaha ungazuzisa kakhulu** - This describes selfishness (""umhawu"") which the passage suggests is a short-sighted approach.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi umuntu angakubeka kuqala uma ukugxila kwakhe kusezintweni angazizuza ngesikhathi esifushane?","The correct answer is **A: Umhawu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when focusing on short-term gains, ""ukuba nomhawu"" (greed) will always be present and potentially yield faster results. It contrasts this with the long-term benefits of collaboration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukusebenzisana nabanye (Collaboration):** The passage suggests collaboration is beneficial *in the long run*, but not for quick gains.
*   **C: Ukubambisana (Unity/Cohesion):**  Similar to collaboration, this is a long-term positive but not a short-term focus.
*   **D: Ubugovu (Fraud):** While related to unethical behavior, the passage specifically highlights ""umhawu"" (greed) as the driving force for short-term profits.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owakhokhela izindleko zempi?","The correct answer is **D: Abantu baseFilipino**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Izindleko zempi zobukhosi baseMelika lapho inqoba iPhilippines zakhokhelwa abantu basePhilippines ngokwabo."" (The costs of the American imperial war when conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhulumeni wasePhilippine:** While bonds were issued *in the name of* the Philippine government, the passage says the *people* were forced to pay taxes to cover the costs.
* **B: Amabange waseWall Street:** Wall Street banks facilitated the bonds, but didn't pay the costs themselves.
* **C: Umbuso wamabutho waseU.S:** The passage states the *Filipino people* paid, not the U.S. military government.



"
Isiphi isikhathi esafika ngaphambi kweminyaka yeTemplars?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekuqaleni kweminyaka yeMiddle Ages**.

The passage states: ""IHigh Middle Ages yandulelwa i-Early Middle Ages..."" which means the Early Middle Ages came *before* the High Middle Ages (and therefore, before the time of the Templars who existed during the High Middle Ages).



"
Isiphi isikhathi esafika ngemva kweTemplars?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngasekupheleni kwemiyaka yeMiddle Ages**.

Here's why:

The text states that the High Middle Ages was *followed* by the Late Middle Ages, which typically ends around 1500. Since the Templars existed *during* the High Middle Ages, the period that came after them was the Late Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umnyaka wekhulu wesi-12** - This is a period *within* the High Middle Ages, not what followed it.
*   **C: Iminyaka ephezulu yeMiddle Ages** - This *is* the period the Templars were active in, not what came after.
*   **D: Umnyaka wekhulu wesi-11** - This is a period *within* the High Middle Ages, not what followed it.

Ikuphi ukulashwa okungavezwanga okwasetshenjiswa abodokotela banahlinzi ngesikhathi sombuso wamaRoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukulapha ukugcindezeleka kwangemva kokuhlukumezeka ngokusebenzisa imithi ezihlukahlukene elalisayo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states doctors used morphine (from poppy seeds) and scopolamine (from herbane) as **analgesics (pain relievers)**. While not explicitly stated as treatment for *trauma-induced stress*, pain relief would be a crucial part of dealing with the aftermath of injuries. This is the most logical inference from the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage specifically mentions scopolamine *coming from* herbane, not being used *to treat* herbane.
*   **C:** The passage states arterial clamps were used to **control** blood flow, not to cause it.
*   **D:** The passage mentions amputation to *save* patients from gangrene - it wasn’t for organ failure itself.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okungeke kwanikelwa udomo ekuthuthukiseni ezokwelapha ngesikhathi sokubuso amaRoma?","The correct answer is **C: Indlela okufundwa ngayo ezibhedlela**.

Here's why:

The passage details advancements in *medical practices* (pain management, surgery, first aid) and *organization* (doctors being officially recognized, a military medical corps). It doesn't mention anything about how medical *education* was conducted or how hospitals operated in terms of teaching and learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indlela izidumbu esibekwangayo kwezokwelapha** - The passage specifically mentions surgical procedures and dealing with issues like gangrene, implying interaction with the human body.
* **B: Umthetho wombuso onamandla onamasosha** - The passage states Augustus's role and the creation of a military medical corps, which directly relates to strong governmental laws supporting medicine.
* **D: Indlela Inkosi eqasha ngayo abodokotela** - The passage mentions doctors being officially recognized by Augustus, which hints at a system of employing or acknowledging medical professionals.

"Ingabe ukubona, noma ukukwazi ukubona kuncike kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Uhlelo lwezinzwa zokubona noma amehlo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukubona, noma ukukwazi ukubona kuncike **ohlelweni lwezinzwa zokubona noma amehlo**."" 

The other options are *characteristics* of different eye structures, but not *where* sight depends on."
Ukwakheka kweso kwezinto ezizizungezile ezincani zixhomeke kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuzwela kwe-wavelength** (Wavelength sensitivity).

Here's why:

The passage states that different eye structures are sensitive to *different kinds of light* (which is determined by wavelength) and have varying capabilities. This directly relates to how an eye's structure is dependent on what part of the light spectrum it needs to detect.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **B: Izinto ezidengekayo ezincani** (What materials are used) - While materials matter, the passage focuses on *what* the eye detects, not *how* it's built.
* **C: Izinga lokuhluka** (Degree of variation) - The passage mentions variation in eye structures, but doesn’t explain *why* those variations exist.
* **D: Ukuhlukahluka kokwakheka kwezinto ezincani** (Variation in the structure of things) - This is too broad. The passage specifically discusses variation in *eye* structures based on their needs.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, abantwana abanenkinga yokuzwa bangakuthola kunzima ukuxila kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Umsebenzi wesikole** (Schoolwork).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Izingane ezine-ADD zibhekana nobunzima uma kufanele ukuthi zibhekane nemisebenzi yazo yesikole..."" (Children with ADD struggle when they have to deal with their schoolwork...).

The passage contrasts this difficulty with their ability to focus on things they *enjoy*, like games and cartoons. Therefore, schoolwork is where they have trouble concentrating.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani abantwana abanenkinga wokuzwa bangaze bazifake enkinga yokuziphatha okuyingozi?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuququzela izinqgondo zabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""…zingane zizithola zisobishini ngenxa ”yokuzigaxa ekuziphatweni okuyingozi, ziyalwa, zilwisana nabasegunyeni” ukuze nje zishukumise izingqondo zazo, njengoba izingqondo zazo zingashukunyiswa ngezindlela ezivamile.""  This directly translates to children getting into trouble with behavior *in order to stimulate their minds* because their minds aren’t stimulated in normal ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukunciphisa ukunyakaza kakhulu** - The passage says they *need* stimulation, not less movement.
*   **B: Ukubasiza ukuba bakwazi ukwakha ubungani nontanga yabo** - While ADD affects relationships, the passage doesn't state this is the *reason* for risky behavior.
*   **C: Ukunaka okumelwe kubuye kubazali** - The passage does not mention parental attention as a motivator for the behavior.

"Ngokuya kwalemininigwane kulesi sigaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungekona isibonelo se-scaffolding?","The correct answer is **C: Uhlelo oluzimele lokufundisa**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage defines scaffolding as support given to learners as they tackle new tasks.** It's about assistance *during* the learning process, not a completely independent learning system.
*   **A, B, and D all represent forms of support:**
    *   **A: Okokufundisa ekuqaleni kwegame yekhompuyutha** - Initial tutorials *guide* you through a new program.
    *   **B: Uthisha weSAT** - A teacher provides guidance, explanations, and strategies.
    *   **D: Umqeqeshi we-league yabancani** - A coach provides instruction and support to help players improve.
*   **C: Uhlelo oluzimele lokufundisa** - This is a complete, self-contained learning system. It doesn't *provide support* during the learning process; it *is* the learning process. It implies the learner is doing everything independently, which is the opposite of scaffolding.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokuqondile umbono we- scaffolding?,"The correct answer is **B: Icebo kakhulu kunensiza kufundisa.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scaffolding is *not* a method of teaching in itself, but rather a *tool* that provides support. Saying it's ""more of a plan than a resource"" contradicts this. It suggests scaffolding is a strategy for *how* to teach, instead of something *used within* teaching.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: IScaffolds iyakhona ezinkundleni zokuxhumana:** The passage mentions computer scaffolds *within* applications, which could conceptually extend to social media platforms.
*   **C: Iyaziwa ngokuthi uhlelo oluthile lokufundisa:** While scaffolding can be *part* of a teaching system, the text emphasizes it's a support structure *within* a system, not a system itself.
*   **D: AmaScaffolds asetshenjiselwa ukusekela ukufundeni kwasekuqaleni:** The text clearly states scaffolding provides assistance to learners tackling *new* things, which encompasses initial learning phases.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iMySpace ingabasiza njani abafundi laba abakuthola kunzima ukufunda?","The correct answer is **C: IWeb address eyodwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kungafinyelelwa kalula kuleli khasi ngokunikeza ikheli elilodwa vo lewebhu, okwenza kube lula ukulikhumbula futhi kube lula nokulibhala kubafundi okungenzeka babe nenkinga yokusebenzisa ikhibhodi noma yesipelingi."" This directly explains how MySpace helps students who struggle with typing or spelling - by providing a single, easy-to-remember web address.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukushintsha into esimwesayo uyise ezingeni eliphezulu** - This doesn't relate to helping students with difficulties.
*   **B: amaBlogs** - While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn’t say they help students with typing/spelling.
*   **D: amaphrofayili angaba amamiliyoni ayi-54** - The number of profiles doesn’t address the specific issue of students struggling with typing.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo bekungekona ukusabela kwakaiKrushchev esitelekeni?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukhethe ugqongqoshe omusha**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Khrushchev **allowed** Władysław Gomułka to become the new prime minister. He didn't *choose* him as a response to the strike; he yielded to popular demand and allowed it.
*   The passage explicitly mentions Khrushchev **sent troops** (B) to suppress the situation.
*   The passage states Khrushchev **granted some economic demands** (D).
*   The passage mentions he **considered economic appeals** (C).

Therefore, choosing a new prime minister was not a direct *response* to the strike in the same way the other options were. It was a consequence of the pressure from the strike, but not an action taken *in response to it*."
Ikuphi okulandelayo bekungeyona imbangela yesiteleka sasePoland?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukukhethwa kukaWladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev *allowed* Gomulka to become the new prime minister *as a result* of the protests, not as a cause of them. The protests were about economic hardship – lack of food and low wages – and a broader discontent with Communist rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Communism:** The passage clearly states the protests were ""against Communism.""
*   **B: Ukushoda kokudla (Food shortages):** The passage explicitly mentions workers protesting ""lack of food.""
*   **C: Ukunciphisa umholo (Wage cuts):** The passage also specifically mentions protests over ""reduced wages.""



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kumoshe ubudlelwane phakathi neUSSR neUSA?","The correct answer is **B: Imibono ngeGermany**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the following caused tension *after* WWII:

*   **""ukungqubuzana kwezimiso, izinqubo kanye namasiko""** – This translates to disagreement over ideologies, processes, and cultures (relating to option A and C).
*   **""ukuphikisana mayelana nohlelo""** – This translates to disagreement about systems (relating to option D).

The passage does *not* mention any disagreement regarding Germany. It focuses on the broader ideological and systemic differences between the USSR and the USA that led to the Cold War.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungacazi ngokuqondile injongo yenzinzwa yokuthumela ama-impulse emzimbeni wonke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukulawula ukugeleza kwegazi** (To regulate blood flow).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Isimiso Sezinzwa sakha uzinzo ngokuthumela umuzwa wokufisa emzimbeni wonke ukuze *ugcine umjikelezo wegazi uqhubeka ungaphazamiseki*"" (The nervous system creates stability by sending a feeling throughout the body to *keep the blood circulation going without interruption*).  This directly relates to regulating blood flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukwehlisa ukuhamba kwegazi** (To decrease blood flow): The passage says the opposite - it *maintains* blood flow.
* **C: Ukulawula i-homeostasis** (To regulate homeostasis): While the nervous system *contributes* to homeostasis, the passage specifically focuses on blood circulation as the function being described. Homeostasis is a much broader concept.
* **D: Ukubalekela izinto ezingalimaza umzimba** (To flee from things that harm the body): The passage mentions keeping the body ""safe from anything harmful,"" but the *mechanism* described is maintaining blood circulation, not simply fleeing.  Fleeing would be a *response* enabled by the system, not the system's primary function in this context.



"
Yini etholakala kuGiza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **D: i-The Great Pyramid**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""IThafa Eliphakeme laseGiza, noma “iGiza Necropolis” eSigodini sabaFile saseGibhithe linemibhoshongo emingxa-ntathu eminingana (leyo umbhoshongo omkhulu kuyiwo omkhulu kakhulu), amathuna amaningana amancane, amathempeli amaningana, kanye ne-Sphinx enkulu."" While A and B are also *found* on the Giza Plateau, the passage highlights the Great Pyramid (umbhoshongo omkhulu) as a key component. Option C is incorrect as it refers to the Seven Wonders of the World, not what's specifically at Giza."
Kwakuyini injongo yeGreat Pyramid?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlonipha uPharoah** (To honor the Pharaoh).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""IPhiramidi eliKhulu ngelinye lezakhiwo zamaphiramidi ezakhelwe ukuhlonipha uFaro oshonile."" (The Great Pyramid is one of the pyramid structures built to honor a deceased Pharaoh.) and ""Umboshongo omkhulu ongunxa-ntathu wakhelwe ukuhlonipha uFaro uKhufu..."" (The large triangular tomb was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuba yinxenye yezinto ezimangazayo eziyisikhombisa womhlaba wonke** (To be part of the seven wonders of the world) - While true, this isn't the *reason* it was built. It's a result of its impressive nature.
*   **C: Kuzoba uphawu lwendawo** (To be a symbol of the area) - It may *function* as a symbol now, but that wasn't its original purpose.
*   **D: Ukubeka amathuna wabantu asebashona** (To place the graves of people who have passed away) - While tombs were *part* of the complex, the primary purpose of the Great Pyramid itself was to honor the Pharaoh.



"
Umthwalo wemfanelo kabani ukuze sazi ukuthi i-arsonist iyamosha ithempeli?,"The correct answer is **C: uStrabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Greek historian Strabo *later wrote down the arsonist's name (Herostratus)*, which is how we know it today. While the Ephesians decreed his name should be remembered, it was Strabo's writing that preserved that knowledge for us.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abase Efesu:** They decreed his name should be remembered, but they didn't *tell* us his name directly through surviving writings.
*   **B: uAlexander Omkhulu:** He offered to rebuild the temple, he didn't identify the arsonist.
*   **D: uArtemis:** She is a goddess and therefore couldn't identify the arsonist.

Isiphi isitatimende esiqondile mayelana nokukwakhiwa kabusha kwethempeli likaArtemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwakhiwa kabusha ngemva kokubusa kwakaAlexander Omkhulu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kamuva, ngemva kokuba u-Alexander efile, ithempeli lakhiwa kabusha ngo-323 BCE."" This directly translates to ""Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE."" This clearly indicates the rebuilding happened *after* Alexander's reign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage specifically states Alexander *offered* to fund the rebuilding, but his offer was *declined*.
* **C:** Herostratus destroyed the temple; he wasn't asked to pay for its rebuilding.
* **D:** While close, the passage states the rebuilding began in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kwakukuni lapho izilwane zaqala ukuhamba ngezinyawo ezimbil?","The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka eyisigidi yesikhombisa eyadlula**.

The passage states: ""...ama-Sahelanthropus kungenzeka ayehamba ngezinyawo ezimbili ngaphambili kakhulu eminyakeni eyizigidi eziyisikhombisa edlule."" ( ...Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs even earlier than seven million years ago.) 

This indicates the earliest potential instance of bipedalism mentioned in the text."
Hlobo luni lwezilwane ezahamba ngezinyawo ezimbili?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Australopithecus**.

Here's why:

The text states that evidence of walking on two legs (bipedalism) is found in *Australopithecus* fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago. While *Homo Erectus* also walked upright, the passage specifically highlights *Australopithecus* as having early evidence of this trait. *Sahelanthropus* is mentioned as *possibly* walking on two legs even earlier, but it's presented as less certain. Option C is a general description, not a specific animal.



"
Ibutho lamasosha aselwandle azama ukwenzani ngesikhathi seWWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuvimba abantu nezimpahla ukuze zingayi eBrithani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the German naval force (using U-boats) was ""trying to prevent this transport"" (referring to the American effort to send people and goods to Britain).  This means they were attempting to block people and supplies from *reaching* Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuvimba izimpahla okumelwe ziye eBrithani** - While they were blocking goods, they were also blocking *people*
*   **C: Ukuthutha izimpahla kulolonke laseAtlantic** - The German force was *preventing* transport, not doing it themselves.
*   **D: Ukuvimba abantu nezimpahla ukuze zingayi eMelika** - They were focused on stopping shipments *to Britain*, not from reaching America.



"
"Ngokuya kwalemniningwane enikeziwe esigabeni, ubani owaphumelela kangcono empini yaseNyakatho Atlantic Campaign?","The correct answer is **A: Amangisi namaMelika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Americans were trying to get people and supplies to Britain, while the Germans were trying to *prevent* that. It then concludes that **if the Allies (Americans & British) had failed**, Germany would likely have conquered Britain. This implies the Allies *did not* fail, and thus were the more successful party in maintaining the crucial supply lines.
"
Yini ebeyingekho ngesikhathi AmaAsiriya athatha indawo?,"The correct answer is **A: amaSaddles**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Izihlalo zamahhashi bezingakasungulwa, ngakho ibutho lamahhashi lama-Asiriya belilwa ngaphezu kwamahhashi angenazihlalo."" This means saddles did not exist at the time the Assyrians were taking over territory.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: amaCrossbows** - The passage does not mention crossbows.
*   **C: Izinqola zamahashi** - The passage discusses cavalry, meaning horse-drawn chariots existed.
*   **D: Izimpahla zokuzivikela** - The passage mentions armor being pierced, implying protective gear existed, even if it wasn't effective against Assyrian weapons.



"
Beziliwa kanjani izimpi ebezinezinqola zokulwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Gibele ihashi**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Around 1000 B.C., the Assyrians used the first cavalry troops. Cavalry are troops that fight on horseback.""  This directly indicates that warfare involving chariots and, later, cavalry was fought *on horseback*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuhamba ngezinyawo (Walking):** While infantry existed, the passage focuses on the impact of chariots and cavalry, not foot soldiers.
*   **B: Ngaphandle kwezimpahla zokuzivikela (Without armor):** The text mentions the chariots being used to pierce enemy armor, implying soldiers *did* have armor.
*   **D: Ngama sosha angekho amanengi (With few soldiers):** The text doesn't suggest a shortage of soldiers. It highlights specialized troops like cavalry.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kukuphi lapho ongeke uthole umuntu owaseBhabhiloni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuletha iminikelo ngaphakathi kwendawo engcwele**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""only the priest could enter the inner sanctuary"". Therefore, a Babylonian person would *not* be found bringing offerings *inside* the holy place. The other options describe locations where Babylonians would be present:

*   **A:** They brought offerings to the temple grounds.
*   **B:** They attended events at temples.
*   **C:** The temple had an open courtyard where festivals were held.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo kwanzelwa ngokuqondile amapristi?,"The correct answer is **B: Izindawo ezincwele**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...umphristi kuphela owayengena endaweni engcwele."" This directly indicates that priests had exclusive access to the holy places within the temples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umkhosi (Ritual)** - The passage mentions rituals/festivals as offerings *to* the gods, not something priests exclusively did.
*   **C: Umcimbi (Ceremony)** - Similar to ""umkhosi,"" ceremonies were part of worship, not restricted to priests.
*   **D: i-Ziggurats** - While Ziggurats were part of the temple complex, the passage doesn't say priests exclusively used them, just that they *were* part of the temples. The most sacred part of the Ziggurat was specifically for the god, not the priest.



"
Inkosi uTutankhamun waluthola nini udumo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva ngokutholwa kwethuna lakhe** (After the discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nokho, ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe ngo-1922 kwamenza usowaziwayo."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukulandela ukwetshiwa kwethuna** (Following the excavation of the tomb) - While excavation happened *with* the discovery, the passage emphasizes the *discovery* itself brought fame.
*   **B: Phakathi nesikhathi sokubusa kwakhe** (During his reign) - The passage says he wasn't considered very important during ancient times.
*   **D: Ngemva kokuvezwa ohlwini lenkosi yasendulo** (After being listed on the ancient king list) - The passage explicitly states he wasn't recorded on many ancient king lists.



"
Yini eyenza Inkosi uTutankhamun waduma njenge Nkosi yaseEgibhite?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe elingathintwanga** (The discovery of his untouched tomb).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Nokho, ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe ngo-1922 kwamenza usowaziwayo."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Udumo lwakhe ohliwini lwenkosi yasendulo** (His fame on the ancient royal lineage) - The passage says he wasn't considered very important *during* ancient times and wasn't widely recorded in royal lists.
* **C: Ukuntshontshwa kwezinto eziyinkulungwane ethuneni lakhe** (The unearthing of thousands of items in his tomb) - While the items *contributed* to his fame, the *discovery* of the tomb is what initially made him well-known.
* **D: Ukubonakala kwakhe ngesikhathi saseGibhite** (His appearance during the Egyptian period) - The passage doesn't focus on his appearance or life while he was alive, but on what happened *after* his death.



"
Imbongi yaseGreek uHomer yini ebeyimuhlulwa ukuyenza?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukukhuluma (Speaking)**.

Here's why:

The text states Homer was a ""renowned epic poet."" Poets *create* poetry through the spoken (or written) word. He *wrote* the Iliad and the Odyssey. Therefore, his skill was in speaking/composing verses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuzwa (Hearing):** While important for a poet, it isn't what *defines* their work.
*   **B: Ukubona (Seeing):**  Also important, but not the core skill of a poet.
*   **C: Ukuhamba (Walking):** Irrelevant to his profession.



"
Yimuphi umuGrikhi odumile owazelwa okunye ngaphandle kwezincwadi?,"The correct answer is **C: u-Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Omunye umGreki odumile usozibalo uPythagoras, owaziwa kakhulu ngomqondo wakhe oqinisekiswa ngokuchasiselwa odumile omayelana nokuhlangana phakathi kwezinhlangothi zonxantathu abanezinhlangothi ezimbili eziqondene ngqo."" This clearly identifies Pythagoras as a mathematician (someone working outside of literature).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **u-Sophocles:** is described as a playwright (part of literature).
*   **u-Homer:** is described as a poet (part of literature).
*   **u-Aristophanes:** is also described as a playwright (part of literature)."
Umdeni wesiHebheru bebacitha isikhathi kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapho kuvuleke khona** (Where it is open).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Isikhathi esiningi impilo yemindeni yamaHebheru yenzeka **endaweni evulekile**."" (Much of the life of Hebrew families took place **in the open**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emgwaqeni** (On the street) - While shops faced the street, the passage doesn’t say families spent *all* their time on the street.
*   **C: Phakathi egcekeni** (Inside the kitchen) - The woman cooked *in* the kitchen, but the passage indicates family life wasn't limited to that space.
*   **D: Phakathi endlini** (Inside the house) - The passage specifically states that the house wasn't very important, and life happened *outside* of it.



"
Yini okungabalulekanga emdenini wamaHebheru?,"The correct answer is **A: Isimo sezulu sabo** (Their climate).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Esimweni sezulu esifudumele saseMpumalanga ePhakathi, indlu beyingabalulekanga kakhulu."" This directly translates to: ""In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not very important.""

The passage explains that because of the warm weather, life happened outdoors, making a house less crucial for daily living. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Izitolo zabo** (Their shops) - The passage states shops *were* tables open to the street, implying they were present and functioning.
*   **C: Imizi yabo** (Their homes) - While not elaborate, homes were built of stone. The passage focuses on their *importance* being less, not their existence.
*   **D: Ukupheka kwabo** (Their cooking) - Cooking was done outdoors, but it was still an activity that happened, and the passage doesn't say it was unimportant.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi umahluko phakathi kweScandanavia nezinye iziwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Indawo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states differences between the Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland) in terms of **history (umlando), customs (amasiko), and people (abantu)**. It directly highlights these as areas of divergence.

However, it *doesn't* discuss geographical location (indawo) as a point of difference. While these countries are geographically close, the passage doesn't address how their locations differ or contribute to their unique identities.

Therefore, location is the one aspect *not* explained as a differentiating factor.



"
Ngubani owahlelwa e-Greenland kuqala?,"The correct answer is **A: Izizwe zama-Eskimo**.

The passage states: ""Kodwa naphezu kokuba etholakele, isizwe sama-Eskiro besilokhu sihlala lapho ngaleso sikhathi."" (But despite being discovered, the Eskimo people had already been living there at that time.)

This clearly indicates the Eskimo people were the first inhabitants of Greenland."
Iliphi iqembu elikhetha ukudla ngaphandle kokusebenzisa izitulo?,"The correct answer is **C: Amadoda acebile aseRoma**.

The text states: ""nakuba abantu abampofu kanye nabesifazane babedla ukudla kwabo babe behlezi ezihlalweni, amadoda acebile ayethanda ukuba namadili ndawonye lapho ayehlala khona ngezinhlangothi kuyilapho edla ukudla kwawo."" This directly translates to: ""although poor people and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to have couches where they reclined on the sides while eating their food."""
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungeyona inxenye yedile laseRoma lakudala?,"The correct answer is **D: Isitsha se-turkey eyosiwe** (A dish of roasted turkey).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that ancient Romans did *not* have foods that came to Europe from the Americas (like turkey). They had no potatoes, tomatoes, maize, or cocoa. Turkey is native to the Americas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izivakashi ezimpofu zidlela ezitulweni** (Poor guests ate at tables) - The passage mentions that poor people and women ate while seated.
*   **B: Ukuhalela iminenke** (Eating snails) - The passage lists snails as part of the Roman diet.
*   **C: Amadoda ahlezi phansi adla ukudla kwakusihlwa** (Men sat on couches to eat dinner) - The passage states wealthy men preferred to dine while reclining on couches.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kuhlala isikhathi eside?","The correct answer is **B: Isiko elincani** (A small culture).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Amasiko amancane ngokuvamile ayanyamalala ngaphandle kokushiya ubufakazi obungokomlando futhi ayahluleka ukuqashelwa njengemiphakathi yangempela."" (Small cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence and fail to be recognized as real societies). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umphakathi** (Society) - The passage defines the text based around community and its longevity.
*   **C: Imiso sedolobha** (City states) - The passage mentions that city states precede nations, implying some level of enduring presence.
*   **D: Isiko eselithuthukile** (Developed culture) - A developed culture implies a level of sophistication and transmission of knowledge that would help it endure.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini eyeza kuqala kunesizwe?","The correct answer is **C: Imiso sedolobha** (Provinces).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izifundazwe zandulela izizwe."" This translates to ""Provinces precede nations.""  Therefore, provinces came before nations.



"
Isiphi isitatimende okungesona iqiniso ngoDrukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Yakhiwa ukuze kuhalalise ukuhlulwa kwamasosha weTibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Dzong was built to *commemorate* (remember) the victory over Tibetan and Mongol troops, not to *celebrate* (triumph over) their defeat. While victory is implied, ""commemorate"" has a different nuance. The other options are directly supported by the text:

*   **B: Ise Bhutan** – The text explicitly states it's in the Paro Valley in Bhutan.
*   **C: Umlilo wamosha izinsalela zezakhiwo** – The passage says the fire left only some remnants of Drukgyal Dzong.
*   **D: Yenziwa uZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** – The text clearly states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza imiphulela yomlimo eDrukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Izinsalela ezasala zesithombe sikaZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ngo-1951, umlilo ubangele ukuba ezinye nje zezinto ezasala zaseDrukgyal Dzong ukuba zisale, njengomfanekiso kaZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" (In 1951, a fire caused only remnants of Drukgyal Dzong to remain, such as the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.) This directly describes the result of the fire damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ibutho likaTibetan-Mongol yilona elanqoba** - The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *defeated* the Tibetan-Mongol armies.
*   **C: Indawo ethandiwa abantu ayikaze ithinteke** - The passage states it was damaged by fire.
*   **D: Yagcinwa kahle uZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The passage doesn't say anything about Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel being preserved, but about his portrait being one of the remnants after the fire.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo ngeCambodia kuyiqiso?,"The correct answer is **D: AmaThais amosha iPhnom Phen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""AbaseThailand bahlasele i-Cambodia izikhathi eziningana ngekhulu lama-18 leminyaka kanti ngo-1772 babhubhisa i-Phnom Phen."" (""The Thais attacked Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they sacked Phnom Penh."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abantu beVietnam bamosha iPhnom Phen:** The passage says the Vietnamese *attacked* Cambodia, but doesn't mention them sacking Phnom Penh.
*   **B: iCambodia yazungenza iThailand ngo1772:** The passage states the *opposite* - Thailand attacked and sacked Phnom Penh.
*   **C: ICambodia yavinjezelwa iVietnamese ekuqaleni kweminyaka eyikhulu yesi18:** While the passage mentions Vietnamese attacks, it states these happened in the *latter* part of the 18th century, not the beginning.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo kuchaza kahle ukuvinjezelwa kweCambodia?,"The correct answer is **B: IThais neVietnam bavimbezela iCambodia ngo1772**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""AbaseThailand bahlasele i-Cambodia izikhathi eziningana ngekhulu lama-18 leminyaka kanti ngo-1772 babhubhisa i-Phnom Phen."" (The Thais attacked Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772) and ""Eminyakeni yokugcina yekhulu lama-18 leminyaka abantu baseVietnam babuye bahlasela iKhambodiya."" (In the last years of the 18th century the Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-Vietman bavimbezela iCambodia kaningana** - While true, it doesn't mention the Thais, who were also significant aggressors.
* **C: Abantu beVietnam bamosha iPhnom Phen** - Only the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh.
* **D: IThais yavimbezela iCambodia kaningana** - While true, it doesn't mention the Vietnamese, who were also significant aggressors.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungeziwa iDutch East India Company ngesikhathi baseTaiwan?,"The correct answer is **C: Qasha amaShayina ezindaweni zokutshala**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...and hired Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While they *did* establish a base in southwestern Taiwan, the question asks what they did *in addition* to that.
*   **B:** The text mentions they *changed* native agricultural production, not that they disrupted it.
*   **D:** The Dutch didn't voluntarily give authority to the Qing dynasty; the Qing dynasty *took* Taiwan from them.



"
Isivumelwani seShimonoseki saqnisa ini?,"The correct answer is **D: Igunya leJapani phezu kweTaiwan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ngemva kokuhlulwa eMpini Yokuqala yamaJapani yase—ino (1894-1895), uhulumeni wase-Qing usayina Isivumelwano se-Simonoseki, ngaso edlulisela iTaiwan eJapani..."". This directly translates to ""after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded Taiwan to Japan..."" This means the treaty established Japanese authority over Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the treaty *resulted* from the war, it didn't *state* the defeat itself.
*   **B:** The treaty ended Taiwan being a Qing territory, it didn't confirm it.
*   **C:** The treaty took power *away* from Taiwan's ability to control coastal regions, it didn't give it more power.



"
Amazinga wepH wekhemikhali akaliswa njani?,"The correct answer is **C: Inani leHydrogen ions elikule khemikhali** (The number of Hydrogen ions in the chemical).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Izinga le-pH likhonjwa inani lama-ion weHydrogen (i-H kuyi-pH) kuyikhemikhali elihlolwayo.""  (pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H is for pH) in the chemical being tested.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ilulla kangakani lekhemikali noma ine-asidi engakanani** (How diluted the chemical is or how much acid it contains): While pH *relates* to acidity, it's not a direct measure of dilution or the amount of acid, but the concentration of hydrogen ions.
*   **B: Mangakhi amaprothoni akulekhemikhali** (How many protons are in the chemical):  The passage specifically discusses *ions* of hydrogen, which are protons that have lost electrons.  Total protons aren't what determine pH.
*   **D: Mangakhi ama-electron akulekhemikhali** (How many electrons are in the chemical): The number of electrons is related to the formation of ions, but the pH is directly about the *number of hydrogen ions*.



"
Yini eyakhishwa kuHydrogen ions?,"The correct answer is **D: ama-Electrons**.

The passage states: ""Ama-ion weHydrogen amaphrothoni lawo ekususwe ama-elektroni wawo..."" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed..."". Therefore, electrons are what are removed from hydrogen ions."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile amabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **A: Baziphathisa okwezinja ezeninengi (They behave like dogs in packs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ivuyo lamabhubesi liziphatha njengomhlambi wamanketshane..."" (Lions behave like jackals in packs...) This directly contradicts the statement about them behaving like dogs.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: Isilinganiso samadoda nabesifazane asilingani (The ratio of males to females is unequal):** The text states a pride consists of ""iduna elilodwa noma amathathu"" (one or three males) and ""izinsikazi ezintathu"" (three females), implying an imbalance.
* **C: Amadoda nabesifanzane bayahlobana (Males and females are related):** The text says the females are typically related (""umndeni omkhulu wodadewabo noma amadodakazi"" - a large family of sisters or daughters) and the males are also related (""ahlobene"").
* **D: Bobabili bayingozi futhi banobungani (Both are dangerous and friendly):** The passage states they are dangerous to prey (""kuba yingozi ezilwaneni ezizizingelayo"") and act as a pack, implying cooperation and therefore a kind of social bond (friendliness within the pride).



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile ukuziphatha kamabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuziphatha kwabo kuyafana nemindeni yamakathi amakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...but not other big cats."" This means their behavior is *not* similar to other big cat families.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anobungani kakhulu (They are very friendly)** - The passage describes them acting as a cohesive unit, similar to a pack, which implies cooperation and a strong social structure, suggesting friendliness *within the pride*.
*   **B: Ukuziphatha kwabo singakuhlobanisa nempisi (Their behavior can be compared to wolves)** - The passage explicitly states they behave *like* a wolf pack.
*   **C: Kokubili awesilisa nabesifazane kunzima kakhulu ukuba zingela (Both males and females are very effective at hunting)** - The passage states they are dangerous to prey animals, implying they are successful hunters.



"
Abonogwaja bathanda ukuzingelwa iziphi izilwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Amakati amancane**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...adla inyama ebanjelwa ukudliwakusuka kunogwaja kuya ezinyamazaneni."" This means that small cats are preyed upon *by* larger predators, including leopards (nogwaja).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amakati amakhulu** - Leopards would not prey on larger cats.
*   **C: Amakati aphakathi nosayizi** - While leopards might occasionally prey on medium-sized cats, the text specifically mentions small cats as being hunted *from* leopards.
*   **D: Inyamazane** - The text states that leopards hunt *to* gazelles, not the other way around.



"
Amakati amancane athanda ukuzingela kuphi okulandelayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Abonogwaja**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...adla inyama ebanjelwa ukudliwakusuka **kunogwaja** kuya ezinyamazaneni."" This directly indicates that small cats hunt *from* the weasel (nogwaja) up to larger animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amagundwane (Mice):** While cats eat mice, the passage doesn't specifically mention them as part of the hunting range starting *from* the weasel.
*   **C: Inyamazane (Antelope):** The passage mentions antelope as an upper limit of their prey, but not as a primary hunting location.
*   **D: Inyamazane enezimpondo ezimagatshagatsha (Antelope with twisted horns):** This is too specific and not mentioned in the text.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona inxenye yokuzingela kwe-ocelot?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukulandela umnuko wenyamazane**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists believe *large American cats* hunt by scent, but it specifically says **ocelots** hunt by *camouflaging* and then *ambushing* their prey. It doesn't mention ocelots using scent to track prey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuzifihla kokuzifanisa nendawo (Camouflaging with the surroundings):** The passage explicitly states ocelots hunt this way.
*   **C: Ukulandela inyamazane phakathi nobusuku (Following prey at night):** The passage says large American cats have night vision, implying they hunt at night. While it doesn't specifically say ocelots do, it’s consistent with their hunting behavior.
*   **D: Ukuzingela kuphela izilwane izincane ngosayizi (Hunting only small animals in size):** The passage states that large American cats prey on animals much smaller than themselves, and ocelots are large American cats.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile nge-ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ukunuka kwawo kubuthaka** (Their sense of smell is weak).

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists believe American big cats *rely on smell* to track prey. This directly contradicts the idea that their sense of smell is weak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Azingela kahle kakhulu ebusuku** (They don't hunt well at night) - The passage states they have excellent night vision.
*   **B: ahamba ngesinyenyela esikhulu** (they walk with large strides) - The passage specifically states they walk with large strides.
*   **D: Athanda ukuzingela izilwane ezincane** (They like to hunt small animals) - The passage explicitly states this is true of American big cats, including ocelots.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekhe kwathiwa ingwe iyakwazi ukukwenza kahle?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukubhonga (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that only lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars can *properly* roar. While the text mentions the leopard's roar is different from a lion's, it still *can* roar. The text doesn't suggest leopards are unable to do the other activities listed:

*   **Ukugibela (Climbing):** Leopards are known for their excellent climbing abilities.
*   **Ukuxhuma (Jumping):** The text says they can ""jump long distances.""
*   **Ukudonsa (Pulling):** The text states they can ""pull with the strength of a strong man five times over.""



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yimuphi umehluko phakathi kwebhbesi nengwe?","The correct answer is **B: Umsindo wokubhonga** (The sound of roaring).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukubhonga kwehlosi akufani ncamashi nokubhonga kwengonyama, kodwa kucishe kufane nomusho wamagama entukuthelo, amenyezwayo."" (The roar of a tiger is not exactly like the roar of a lion, but it's closer to a string of growling, rumbling words.) This directly highlights a difference in the *sound* of their roars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikhono lokubhukuta** (The ability to swim) - The passage doesn't compare swimming abilities.
*   **C: Ukuxhuma ibanga elide** (Jumping long distances) - The passage states tigers *can* jump long distances, but doesn't compare this to lions.
*   **D: Amandla abo okudonsa** (Their strength to pull) - The passage says tigers can pull with the strength of five men, but doesn't compare this to lions.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okwenziwe uRobert Hooke ngaphambi kokuba kwenziwe amabiologist?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuqaphela amaseli afile** (Observing dead cells).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wayengumuntu wokuqala wokuhlola amangqamuzana afile."" (He was the first person to observe dead cells.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukusebenzisa i-microscope ukubona izinto ezincani eziphilayo** (Using a microscope to see tiny living things) - He observed cells, but the passage specifically says he looked at *dead* cells in cork.
*   **C: Ukuqaphela izikwele ezincani** (Observing small squares) - While he *saw* what looked like small rooms/squares, the important part is he was observing cells (even if he didn’t know they were cells in the modern sense at the time).
*   **D: Ukuqaphela umsebenzi wezinto ezincani eziphilayo** (Observing the function of tiny living things) - He didn’t observe the function, only the structure of dead cells.



"
Umsuka waleli gama elithi seli lisho ukuthini?,"The correct answer is **B: Igumbi elincani**.

The passage states: ""I-cell ivela egameni lesiLatin elithi cella elisho **igumbi elincane**."" (A cell comes from the Latin word cella which means a small room.)"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, izilwane zinekhona lokwenza ini?","The correct answer is **B: Ukunyakaza (To move)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Izilwane ezingi ziyakwazi ukunyakaza."" (Many animals are able to move).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukudiza (To draw)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about animals drawing.
*   **C: Ukubhukuda (To swim)** - While some animals swim, the passage says they're *found* in the ocean, not that they all swim.
*   **D: Ukugubha (To dig)** - The passage mentions animals *living* under the ground, but doesn't say they all dig.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, izilwane eziningi azinani?","The correct answer is **C: Ubuchopho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izilwane kuphela ezinobuchopho (nakuba kungezona zonke izilwane ezinabo; ama-jellyfish, ngokwesibonelo, awanabo ubuchopho).""  This directly translates to ""Only animals have brains (although not all animals have them; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains)."" The passage specifically notes that *not all* animals have brains, making it a characteristic many animals *don't* have.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amasela (Cells):** The passage states animals are made of many cells, but doesn't say many animals *lack* cells.
*   **B: Ukukwazi ukugaya (Ability to digest):** The passage says animals digest food, and implies most do.
*   **D: Ukwazi ukudla (Ability to eat):** The passage says animals eat, and implies most do.



"
Ikuphi okuvuza isitshalo ngesikhathi se-photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Ilanga**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Izitshalo zenza ukudla kwazo nge-photosynthesis."" Photosynthesis requires energy, and that energy comes from the sun. While the passage mentions shade (ithunzi), it's a *result* of plants, not something they need *for* photosynthesis.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ithunzi (Shade):**  Plants *provide* shade, they don't get something *from* shade.
*   **B: Izilwane (Animals):** Animals benefit from plants, but plants don't need animals for photosynthesis.
*   **C: Ukudla (Food):** Plants *make* food through photosynthesis, it isn't what they use *in* the process.



"
Ukuphi okuphishwa abantu okuthathwa izilwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukudla (Food)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Ukudla okuningi esikudlayo izitshalo"" which translates to ""Much of the food we eat are plants.""  This directly answers the question of what humans get from plants that animals also need to survive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umoya-mpilo (Fresh air/Oxygen):** While plants *produce* oxygen, the question asks what humans *take* from plants, and the text doesn’t mention humans taking oxygen from animals.
* **C: Amanzi (Water):** The text doesn't discuss plants providing humans with water.
* **D: Umoya okhishwa umuntu ngemva kokuphefumula (Air exhaled by a person):** Plants *take in* this air (carbon dioxide), they don't provide it to humans.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izibonelo eziveziwe ezingaphazamisa uhlelo lokuziphendukela kwemvelo?","The correct answer is **A: Iqembu elincane elihluleka ukuthuthuka endaweni entsha** (A small group failing to adapt to a new environment).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when a small group becomes isolated, they encounter different resources and competitors, *requiring* them to adapt.  If they *fail* to adapt, they won’t survive and contribute to the formation of a new species. This disruption of adaptation is key to understanding speciation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Inxenye yabantu abanengi abathuthela endaweni entsha** (A portion of a large population moving to a new area): The passage focuses on *small* groups becoming isolated. A large group moving doesn't necessarily create the conditions for speciation as described.
*   **C: Abantu abanengi abazama ukujwayela ukuhlala endaweni entsha** (A large group trying to adjust to living in a new area): This is the opposite of disruption; it's the process of adaptation itself.
*   **D: Iqembu labantu elizophindeka kabili** (A group of people that will double): Reproduction doesn’t inherently disrupt natural selection; it’s *how* the reproduction leads to adaptation (or lack thereof) that matters.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo akuchazi ngokunembile uhlelo lwezinto eziphilayo umazihlukana phakathi ukuzi zizimele? ,"The correct answer is **A: Kwenzeka uma inengi lwabantu abasanda kuqala behluleka ukujwayela**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes speciation happening when a *small group* becomes isolated, not when the *majority* fails to adapt.** The passage specifically states a *small* population splits off. Failure of the larger population to adapt doesn't drive speciation according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Into ebaluleke kakhulu ohlelweni lokuziphendukela kwemvelo** - The passage explicitly states speciation is ""an important part of evolution.""
* **C: Ibhekisela ohlelweni lwezinto ezintsha eziphilayo** - The passage *defines* speciation as the process of forming new species.
* **D: Ukukwenzeka kwayo akuzibeki** - The passage describes speciation as a natural process that *does* happen over time (thousands or millions of years).



"
Iyiphi inxenye ejikelezayo ehambisa igazi enhliziweni?,"The correct answer is **D: Imithambo yegazi** (Veins).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Igazi lingene enhliziyweni ngamapayipi abizwa ngemithambo."" (Blood enters the heart through pipes called veins.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ama-Arteries (Arteries):** The passage states arteries *leave* the heart, they don't bring blood *to* it.
* **B: ama-Capillaries (Capillaries):** Capillaries are the smallest pipes and are involved in exchanging substances with tissues, not directly returning blood to the heart.
* **C: ama-Organs (Organs):** Organs receive blood, they don't transport it directly back to the heart.



"
Yimaphi amathubu amancani lawa ajikeleza umzimba wonke?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-Capillaries**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amapayipi amancane kunawo wonke abizwa ngemithanjana."" (The smallest pipes are called capillaries.)
* **The question asks:** Which small vessels circulate throughout the body?

Capillaries are indeed the smallest blood vessels and are responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues throughout the body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ama-Arteries (Arteries):**  These *carry* blood *away* from the heart, they are not the smallest vessels.
* **C: Imithambo yegazi (Veins):** These *carry* blood *to* the heart, and are larger than capillaries.
* **D: ama-Organs (Organs):** These are body parts, not blood vessels.



"
Ikhono lenambuzane elikwazi ukugoqa izimpiko zayo emuva inyusa kuphi okulandelayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Izindawo zokufihla (Hiding places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lokhu kubanika indawo enkudlwana yezindawo ezincane zokucashela izilwane ezizingelayo."" This directly translates to ""This gives them a small space for hiding from predators.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umtapo wokudla (Food source):** While flying helps find food, the bending of wings doesn't directly *help* with obtaining food.
*   **C: Ukuthola abangani (Finding friends):**  The text doesn't mention anything about finding friends.
*   **D: Isivinini sendiza (Flight speed):** The passage states that flying helps *avoid* predators and *find* food effectively, not that wing bending increases speed.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezwanga kulesi sigaba okubonisa ukuthi ikhono lokundiza lezinambuzane lithintekile?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukusebenza kahle (Performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states flying helped insects ""avoid predators more easily and obtain food and mates more effectively.""  Effectiveness directly relates to *performance*.  The ability to fly improved how well they functioned in their environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukukhiqiza kabusha (Reproduction)** - While getting mates is mentioned, the passage doesn't discuss how flight impacts *reproduction* specifically (like number of offspring, etc.).
*   **B: Ubude bempilo (Lifespan)** - The passage does not mention anything about how long insects live.
*   **C: Ukuqoqa kokudla (Food gathering)** - This is *mentioned* as a benefit of flight, but the question asks what isn't discussed, and its benefit is already noted, making it incorrect.

Therefore, **Ukusebenza kahle (Performance)** is the best answer because it encompasses the overall improvement in how the insects live due to their ability to fly and is supported by the text, but not specifically detailed.



"
Iziphi izici ezilandelayo ezingahltshaniswanga nama-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: Amasiba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that birds *do* share several characteristics with dinosaurs:** walking on two legs (like T-Rex), having scales, and laying eggs.
* **The passage also mentions clawed feet.**

Therefore, the only option that *doesn't* align with dinosaur characteristics, as described in the passage, is **amasiba (feathers)**. While birds have feathers, the passage focuses on the similarities that link them to dinosaurs - like scales, not feathers. It points out that people don't *think* of birds as dinosaurs *because* of their feathers and ability to fly, implying feathers are a difference.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungajwayelekanga okwabelana nezici ezifanayo kwezinyoni nama dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukubeka amaqanda**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""zibekela amaqanda"" (they lay eggs) as a similarity between birds and dinosaurs. While the other options are mentioned, laying eggs is the one explicitly highlighted as a shared trait in the context of the question.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ukuhamba kokubuyela emuva kwezinywo ezimbili:** The passage mentions this (""zihamba ngezinyawo zazo ezimbili zasemuva njengeT-Rex"") but it's presented *as an example* of a shared trait, not the next unusual similarity to be identified.
*   **C: Ikhona lokundiza:** The passage actually points out that people *don't* think of birds as dinosaurs *because* they can fly. It's presented as a difference, not a similarity.
*   **D: Izinyawo ezinezinzipho:** The passage states ""Zinezinyawo ezinocwecwe nezinzipho"" - this is true, but the question asks for what the passage would identify as the *next* unusual similarity.

"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi ingxenye yesitshalo ye-cycad okungenzeka iTriceratops iyidle?","The correct answer is **A: Amahlamvu ahlabayo** (The vibrant leaves).

The text specifically states: ""ITriceratops yayingasebenzisa umlomo wayo oqinile ukuhluba **amaqabunga** ngaphambi kokudla isiqu."" (Triceratops would have used its strong beak to strip **leaves** before eating the core.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isiqu sesihlahla** (The core of the tree) - While the text says Triceratops ate *after* stripping leaves, it doesn't say it ate the core itself.
*   **C: Impande** (Roots) - The text mentions Triceratops being able to crush roots, but doesn't say it specifically ate cycad roots.
*   **D: Izithelo** (Fruits) - The text doesn't mention cycads having fruits, or Triceratops eating them. It does mention other animals eating *toxic* fruits/branches, but specifically refers to cycad *leaves* when discussing Triceratops."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungenzeka iTriceratops? ","The correct answer is **B: Isitshalo esinama gatsha aqinile** (A plant with strong branches).

Here's why:

The passage states that Triceratops could crush not only leaves but also *very tough branches and roots*. The question asks what Triceratops might consume, and the text directly mentions tough branches as part of its diet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Sloth** - The passage doesn't mention sloths.
*   **C: Upholi** - While the passage mentions opossums (a marsupial, and descendant of dinosaurs) eating toxic branches/fruit, it doesn't say Triceratops ate them.
*   **D: Isitshalo isinesithelo esinoshevu** - The text focuses on branches and leaves, and while opossums eat toxic fruit, the passage's discussion about this is about *why* it might be unlikely Triceratops ate them, not that they did.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi imidlalo ethandekayo nedumile enyakatho yezifunda ze-Italy?","The correct answer is **C: i-Snowboarding**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imidlalo yasebusika ithandwa kakhulu ezindaweni eziseNyakatho, lapho amaNtaliyane encintisana khona emidlalweni yamazwe onke kanye nasemidlalweni yama-Olimpiki.""  While it doesn't *specifically* mention snowboarding, this clearly indicates winter sports are popular in northern Italy. Snowboarding falls under the category of winter sports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibhola:** Football (soccer) is mentioned as popular throughout Italy, not specifically the north.
*   **B: i-Volleyball:** Volleyball is listed as a popular sport generally, but not specifically in the north.
*   **D: i-F1 motor racing:** F1 racing is mentioned as a popular sport, but again, not tied to the northern regions.



"
"Ngokuya ngemininingwane enikeziwe, iwuphi umdlalo owanqobela ubuqawe bomhlaba be-Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Ibhola (Football/Soccer)**.

The text states: ""Ibhola lezinyawo lezwe laseNtaliyane... bekuyizingqwele zeNdebe yoMhlaba yeFIFA ngo-2006."" This directly indicates that football is the sport where Italy achieved global victory.



"
Ngemva kwamuphi umcimbi inxenye yeLuxembourg yaba iBelgian?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukubusa kweBelgian**.

Here's why:

The text states that parts of modern-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg but *became* part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of 1830. This revolution led to Belgian independence and, consequently, the transfer of those Luxembourg territories to Belgium – meaning they came under Belgian rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Impi Yezwe yokuqala** - Luxembourg was involved in World War I, but this didn't cause parts of it to become Belgian.
*   **C: Impi Yezwe yesibili** - Similar to WWI, Luxembourg's involvement in WWII didn't result in territorial changes to Belgium.
*   **D: Ukusungulwa kweEuropean Union** - The EU's formation happened much later and didn't relate to the historical shift of territory between Luxembourg and Belgium.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwathinta ukungathathi uhlangothi kweLuxembourg?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuba izwe elizimele (Being an independent nation)**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""ILuxembourg ibihlale iyizwe elizama ukungathathi uhlangothi..."" This directly links Luxembourg's attempt to remain neutral to its status *as a nation*.  Independence is the foundation for choosing a policy of neutrality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uksebenza kweGermany (German occupation)**: The text mentions German involvement in wars *affecting* Luxembourg, but not as a reason for its neutrality.  The occupation came *after* the attempt at neutrality.
*   **B: Ukujoyina i-European Union (Joining the European Union)**: Joining the EU happened much later and wouldn’t be a reason for an earlier policy of neutrality.
*   **C: Ukubusa kweBelgian (Belgian rule)**:  While parts of Luxembourg were once linked to Belgium, the text doesn't suggest this history influenced their neutrality. It speaks to Luxembourg's own drive for independence.



"
Amakhilomitha ayingakhi waseTurkey ase-Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""amakhilomitha skwele angu-23,764 (9,174 sq mi) aseYurophu.""  The question asks for the kilometers, so 23764 is the answer.



"
"Ngokuya kwesigaba, i-Turkey ingama mayila ayingakhi?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The text states: ""Indawo yaseTheki ingaphezu kwamakhilomitha angu-1,600 (1,000 mi) ubude...""  The question asks for the length in miles, which is 1,000.



"
Yiluphi ulwimi lwesiLathini esetshenjiswa eVatican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Imicimbi yezenkolo** (Religious ceremonies).

The text states: ""...isiLatin sivame ukusebenziswa emikhosini engokwenkolo"" which translates to ""...Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukukhulumisana njalo** (Daily communication) - The text says Italian is used for daily communication.
* **C: Umthetho** (Law) - The text states Vatican City uses Italian law.
* **D: Ukhulumisana okugunyaziwe** (Authorized communication) -  The text doesn't specify Latin being used for authorized communication specifically.



"
"EVatican City, yini okuyisiNtaliyana okungasetshenjiswa?","The correct answer is **D: Ukukhulumisana njalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""IsiNtaliyane sibuye sibe ulimi lwansuku zonke olusetshenziswa iningi lalabo abasebenza esifundeni..."" This means Italian is used for everyday communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umthetho (The law):** While Vatican City *uses* Italian law, the passage doesn't say Italian *is* the law.
*   **B: Ukhulumisana okugunyaziwe (Authorized communication):** The passage doesn’t specify a form of communication being authorized.
*   **C: Imicimbi yezenkolo (Religious events):** The passage says Latin is used for religious events, not Italian.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo okuzuzisa ukuhlanganisa umculo kumakhompuyutha asezingeni eliphezulu?","The correct answer is **B: Amapopayi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Umculo kaningi urekhodwa kusetshenziswa amakhompyutha ayinkimbinkimbi ukusebenzisa **nokuhlanganisa imisindo ndawonye**.""  This directly links complex computers to *mixing* music, which is used in creating sophisticated animations (popayi). The passage explicitly says complex animations are made with computers and are increasingly used in television and film.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umculo** - The passage discusses using computers *with* music, not music benefiting from it.
*   **C: Izithombe** - While computers are used for images and video, the passage doesn’t mention them benefiting from the complex mixing of sounds.
*   **D: Ukwakhiwa** - This is too vague and doesn't have a direct connection to the information given in the passage."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, inengi lezindlu ezinama-toilet aflashayo zikuyiphi indawo?","The correct answer is **A: i-Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states: ""Amadolobha waseHarappa kanye naseMohenjo-daro ayenedlu yangasese eshaywayo cishe kuzo zonke izindlu..."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house...)

The other options are mentioned as having toilets, but not flushing toilets in *most* houses like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa."
Iziphi izindawo ezilandelayo ezatholwa zithuthukile ohlelweni lokucululwa indle?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Harappa**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Harappa and Mohenjo-daro *had* toilets in almost every house, connected to a complex drainage system. The other options (Santorini, Ghibhithe, and China) are mentioned as having toilets, but not necessarily with a highly developed system like Harappa. Santorini's toilets were found in Minoan cities alongside Harappa, but they aren't described as equally developed."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okubangela ukuba i-skater sijike?,"The correct answer is **A: Ijika elincani ngaphansi kweblade lesi-skater** (The curvature under the skater's blade).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the slight curvature under the blade causes the contact point with the ice to also shift as the skater leans. This shift is *what causes* the skater to turn.  The text directly links the blade's curvature to the turning motion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izinhlangothi ezisemaceleni zeblade yesi-skater** (The sides of the skater's blade) - While the sides help with grip, the passage focuses on the *underneath* curvature as the turning mechanism.
* **C: Konke, izinga nekhono lesi-skater** (Everything, the level and skill of the skater) - Skill is important for *executing* a turn, but the passage describes the *physical reason* why a turn happens.
* **D: Izinga leqhwa** (The quality of the ice) - The ice affects grip, but the passage highlights the blade's design as the primary cause of turning.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu,ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile umgodi okublade yesi-skate zamanje?","The correct answer is **A: Emipheto-ekabili** (Two edges).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Insimbi yesicathulo sokushushuluza eqhweni sanamuhla **inezinhlangothi ezimbili** negobongo eligumbekile maphakathi kwazo."" This directly translates to ""Modern skate blades have **two edges** and a curved groove in between them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ijika** (Curve) - While the blade *has* a curve, the defining characteristic mentioned is the two edges.
*   **C: Umgede** (Groove) - The passage mentions a groove, but it's *between* the edges, not the defining feature of the blade itself.
*   **D: Iqinisiwe** (Reinforced) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the blade being reinforced.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iluphi uhlelo oluvumela ama-atomu asuse amandla amanengi angadingekile emhlanyweni?","The correct answer is **B: Ukunyaka kwama-photons** (Emission of photons).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zenza lokhu ngokukhipha inhlayiyana yokukhanya ebizwa “nge-photon”."" (They do this by emitting a particle of light called a ""photon""). It then goes on to explain this process as how atoms shed excess energy.  Therefore, the *emission of photons* is the process that allows atoms to remove excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imisebe** (Light) - While light is involved, it's not the *process* of removing energy, but what the photons *are*.
*   **C: Ama-Photon** (Photons) - Photons are the particles emitted, not the process itself.
*   **D: Ukunyaka kwemisebe** (Emission of light) - This is too broad. The *specific* emission of *photons* is the key process described.



"
Yini ebangela i-athomu ikhiphe i-photon?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukudelela okubangelwa umkhanyo okhanya kakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ososayenzi babiza lenqubo ngokuthi “ukukhishwa kwemisebe okushukumisiwe” ngoba ama-athomu ashukunyiswa ukukhanya okukhanyayo, okubangela ukukhishwa kokukhanya kwefothoni..."" 

This directly links the emission of photons to the *excitation* (shaking up/disturbing) of atoms *by light*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukukhipha amandla amakhulu angadingeki:** While it's true they're releasing energy, the passage doesn't say it's *unnecessary* energy. It's specifically energy gained *from* the light.
*   **C: Izinga lamandla elingalawuleki:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the energy being uncontrolled.
*   **D: Ukusabela kwemisebe engathandekile:** The light isn't described as ""unwanted"" – it's the *cause* of the photon emission.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini engabangela ukuba isibani sokukhanyisa sikagezi singasebenzi?","The correct answer is **C: Okungaphakathi kwesibani okushayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: Ngemuva kokusebenza amahora amakhulu umucu wasibani ugcina ushile bese isibani singasasebenzi. Isibani sesidinga ukushintshwa."" - This directly translates to ""After working for many hours, the filament of the light bulb eventually burns out and the light stops working. The light bulb needs to be replaced.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** The passage emphasizes safety procedures *before* changing the bulb, not that the switch is the cause of the bulb failing.
*   **B:** While the passage *warns* about the metal base being dangerous with electricity, it doesn't say that's *why* the bulb stopped working.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about reduced electrical flow. It specifically discusses the filament burning out.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungaba yingozi mawukuthinta njengoba mawushintsha isibani?,"The correct answer is **A: Imicu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns about touching the *inside* of the socket while the power is on because of the risk of electric shock. The ""imicu"" (terminals/contacts) are the live parts *inside* the socket that carry the electricity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: La ucima khona isibani (The switch to turn off the light)**: The passage actually instructs you to turn off the power *before* changing the bulb.
*   **C: Isisekelo sesibani (The base of the bulb)**: While you handle the base of the bulb, it's not inherently dangerous if the power is off.
*   **D: Intambo (The cord)**: The cord itself isn't the immediate danger; it's what's happening *inside* the socket when the power is on.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, kwenzekani uma i-nucleus ihlukana?","The correct answer is **B: Amandla ayadedelwa** (Energy is released).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that fission involves ""ukukhululwa kwamanye walawo mandla"" (releasing some of that energy) when the nucleus splits. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuzuzeka ama-protons** (Protons are gained) - While fission *does* involve protons, the passage doesn't state that protons are *gained* overall. They are part of what is released during the split.
*   **C: Ama-atomu awahlaliseki** (Atoms become unstable) - The passage says *some* atoms are already unstable and prone to fission, not that fission *causes* atoms to become unstable.
*   **D: Kulahleka ama-neutrons** (Neutrons are lost) -  Similar to protons, neutrons are *released* during fission but the passage doesn’t specify loss.

Yikuphi okulandelayo kuveza ukuthintana okukude okubuyela Emhlabeni,"The correct answer is **B: Amasathelayithi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellites are used to receive the signal and transmit it back down to Earth. The entire scenario describes a communication system utilizing a satellite in space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ama-Telescopes (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used for *observing* things, especially distant objects. While the passage mentions telescopes are used to overcome atmospheric interference, they aren't the component that *returns* the communication.
*   **C: Izibani (Lights):** Lights have nothing to do with this type of communication.
*   **D: Amarokhethi (Rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* the satellite into space, but they don't participate in the communication process itself.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okusetshenjiselwa ukubeka i-telescope ku-space?,"The correct answer is **B: Amarokhethi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kudingeka irokhethi enkulu engaphezu kwamafidiangu-100 ukuphakama ukubeka isiphuphutheki noma ithelisikobho emkhathini."" (A large rocket exceeding 100 feet in height is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Usebe lokhukanya:** The passage mentions light being distorted by the atmosphere, but doesn't say light itself is used to place telescopes.
*   **C: Umkhathi womhlaba:** The passage states the atmosphere *interferes* with viewing, making space preferable.
*   **D: Ubude bamasathelayithi , izinyawo eiziyi-100:** This refers to the size of the rockets needed, not what is used to *place* the telescopes.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okumelwe kuqaphelwe nge-cyclical event ukuze ubone ukudlula kwesikhathi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuphinda phinda (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ungaphawula ukudlula kwesikhathi ngokwakho ngokubheka impinda yesenzakalo somjikelozo. Isenzakalo somjikelezo yinto eyenzeka ngokuphindaphindiwe ngokuvamile."" 

This directly links observing the *repetition* of a cyclical event to perceiving the passage of time.  The fact that it happens *again and again* is what allows us to measure time's flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubude besikhathi (Duration):** While duration is related to time, the passage focuses on *observing* time pass *through* the cyclical event, not measuring its length.
* **C: Ithonya (Intensity):** Intensity doesn't help you perceive the passage of time.
* **D: Ubunzima (Difficulty):** Difficulty is irrelevant to observing time through a cyclical event.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isice sento isikhathi esiqhathanisa naso?","The correct answer is **A: Ubude**.

The passage states: ""Isikhathi futhi siyindlela esiqhathanisa ngayo isikhathi (ubude) sezenzakalo."" This directly translates to ""Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuphinda phinda (Repetition):** While the passage *mentions* cyclical events as a way to *notice* the passage of time, it doesn't say time is compared *to* repetition.
*   **C: Isipiliyoni (Experience):** The passage doesn't state time is compared to experience.
*   **D: Ithonya (Complexity):** The passage states time is difficult to understand, but doesn't compare it to complexity.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo kucatshangelwa okujwayelekile kwendlalifa esikhundleni?","The correct answer is **B: Ukungayi enyuvesi ukuze ujoyine ubusosha** (Not going to university to join the military).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that traditionally, a royal heir would go ""directly into military service after finishing school.""
*   Charles *deviated* from this tradition by going to university first.
*   The other options describe what Charles *did* do, not what is considered traditional for a royal heir.

"
"Ngokuya ngalolulwazi olunikeziwe, uCharles bekungowokuqala ukwenza ini?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuthola iziqu (To get a degree)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""UCharles wayeyilungu lokuqala loMkhaya wamaNgisi waseBukhosini lokunikwa idigiliyi."" This translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukujoyini ubusosha ngaphambi kokuqeda isikole (Joining the military before finishing school):** The passage states the expectation was for heirs to go directly to the military, but Charles *didn't* do that.
*   **B: Ukunda ngeMivukubulo (To rebel against the revelations):** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Ukuya eTrinity College (To go to Trinity College):** While he *went* to Trinity College, he wasn't the first royal to do so; he was the first to get a degree.



"
Iliphi izwe lakuvela khona imikhumbi kaTrygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Norway**.

The text states: ""Le mikhumbi eminingi beyiholwa u-Olaf Trygvasson, umuntu waseNorway..."" (These ships were mostly led by Olaf Trygvasson, a man from Norway...)."
"Ngisiphi isikhathi emladweni, amaJalimane aququzela isiko e-Estonia?","The correct answer is **A: Phakathi neminyaka ey-200**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Cishe ngekhulu lama-15 leminyaka..."" which translates to ""Almost for 15 centuries..."" or roughly 200 years.  The text specifically mentions a significant German influence lasting around that timeframe.
"
Ulwimi lwase Estonia lwathonywa yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Alphabet yesiJalimane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Belusekelwe kuma-alfabhethi wesiJalimane"" (It was based on the German alphabet).  The text explains the Estonian written language *originated* from the German alphabet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uphawu lwe-Õ/õ** - While important, the ""Õ/õ"" is a *result* of the influence, not the influence itself.
*   **C: Ama-monk waseJalimane** - The monks are who *implemented* the change, but the influence comes from the German culture and specifically, the German alphabet.
*   **D: UNkulunkulu** -  While the monks intended to bring God closer to people, God isn’t the linguistic influence itself.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, inani labantu abakhuluma isiHindi luyashintshashitsha ngenxa yaliphi iqiniso?","The correct answer is **A: Amalimu lawo acishe afane nesiHindi ayabalwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The number of native speakers varies depending on whether closely related dialects are counted or not."" This directly means the estimate changes based on whether or not similar languages/dialects are included in the count.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uma abantu abakhuluma isi-Urdu bayabalwa:** While Hindi and Urdu are similar, the passage doesn't say the *count* of Hindi speakers changes based on counting Urdu speakers. It says speakers of both can *understand* each other.
*   **C: Uma abantu abakwazi ukulizwisisa ulwimu bayabalwa:** The passage mentions 800 million people *understand* Hindi, but this is separate from the estimate of *speakers*.
*   **D: Uma abantu abakwazi ukufunda lwimi bayabalwa:** The passage does not mention the ability to read the language.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuliqiniso ngamalimu wesiHindo nesiUrdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuyahluka ngokombhalo (They differ in writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""IsiHindi nesi-Urdu ziyafana ngohlelo lwamagama kodwa ziyahluka ngokubhala (Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but differ in writing).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kunokungahlangani kwabantu abakhuluma amalimi (There is disagreement among people who speak the languages)** - The passage doesn't mention disagreement. It talks about variations in counting speakers.
*   **C: Achishe afane kokubile indlela akhulunywa ngawo nangendlela abhalwa ngayo (They are almost identical in both how they are spoken and how they are written)** - This is the opposite of what the passage says. They are similar in *speaking* but different in *writing*.
*   **D: Iyahluka ngokolwimi (They differ in vocabulary)** - The passage states they are similar in vocabulary, not different.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okunganembile ngeqiniso leHangeul alphabet?,"The correct answer is **B: Igama langempela uHunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

The passage states the alphabet was *originally* called **Hunmin Jeongeum**, not ""Hunan Jeongeum."" This is a misspelling in the option.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: Yasungulwa ekuqaleni kokubusa kukaKing Sejong’s** - The text states it was created in 1444, during his reign (1418-1450), so this is true.
*   **C: Yasungulwa inkosi yesine uJoseon Dynasty** - The text confirms Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty.
*   **D: Yadalwa ngenhloso** - The passage explicitly states it was created with the *purpose* of easy everyday use.



"
I-alphabet elithi Hunmin Jeongeum lashintsha laba yini?,"The correct answer is **B: u-Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Ekuqaleni unike igama i-alfabhethi yeHangeul ngokuthi iHunmin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""Initially he gave the alphabet of Hangeul the name Hunmin Jeongeum..."". This directly indicates that Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name for what is now known as Hangeul.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iluphi ulwimi olwathonywa iSanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Amalimi waseNdiya**.

The passage states: ""I-Sanskrit iwulimi oluyinkimbinkimbi nolucebile, luye lwaba oluyinhloko ezilimini eziningi zanamuhla zaseNdiya..."" (Sanskrit is a complex and rich language, and has been the ancestor of many modern languages of India...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amalimi wesiLatin** - While the passage *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, it doesn't say Sanskrit was the ancestor of Latin.
*   **B: Amalimi waseEurope** - This is too broad. While Latin is a root language for many European languages, Sanskrit's direct influence is on Indian languages.
*   **C: Amalimi wasendulo** - This is also too broad. Sanskrit *is* an ancient language, but the question asks specifically about languages it influenced.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukusebenzisa iSanskirt kwasuswa ngenxa yasiphi isizathu?","The correct answer is **D: Izikundla** (Stages of importance/prevalence).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngemuva kokubhalwa kwama-Upanishad, iSanskrit yamane yanyamalala ngenxa yezigaba zokubaluleka."" This translates to: ""After the writing of the Upanishads, Sanskrit simply disappeared due to stages of importance/prevalence.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inkimbinkimbi** (Complexity) - While the passage says Sanskrit *is* complex, it doesn't say this caused its decline.
*   **B: Ukufuduka kweAryan** (Aryan migration) - The passage mentions this as a theory of Sanskrit's origins, not its disappearance.
*   **C: Amalimi wesiLatin** (Latin languages) - Latin languages are *compared* to Sanskrit, but don't explain its decline.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuyiqiniso mayelana namandla adonsela phansi ku-lo?","The correct answer is **A: Amandla adonsela phansi angakudonsa kancani kunamandla adonsela phansi we-lo**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""You would weigh less on Io than you do on Earth...the force of gravity, actually pulls you less."" This directly supports the idea that gravity on Io is weaker than on Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't say you *won't* survive, just that you'll weigh less.
* **C:** This is a restatement of option B and suffers the same issue - the passage doesn't say it's due to the force of gravity.
* **D:** The passage says the opposite – you weigh *more* on Earth (stronger gravity) than on Io (weaker gravity).



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso okuchaza ilingaphandle lenyanga?","The correct answer is **C: Ngale kohlnangothi kungenzeka kube nokuncani kwe-maria**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kungenzeka kube nezindawo zasenyangeni eziningi ezimnyama ohlangothini ngoba ungqimba luncane.""  These dark areas are called ""maria"". And this is specifically referring to the far side (the side not facing Earth).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhlangothi oluseduze line-crust enkulu** - The passage states the *far side* has a larger crust (100km) compared to the near side (70km), not the other way around.
* **B: Uqweqwe incani kakhulu ngaphansi kwe-zindawo eziphakeme** -  The passage says the crust is thinner under the mountains, not the maria.
* **D: Kungenza kube ne-maria encani ngaphansi kwezindawo eziphakeme** - The passage states the maria are more likely due to the *thin* crust, not because of the highlands themselves.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ingabe uqweqwe lweNyanga luwugqinsi kuphi?","The correct answer is **C: Ngaphansi kwezinkangala**.

The text states: ""Lulula ngaphansi kolwandle futhi **lungugqinsi ngaphansi kwezinkangala**."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ohlangothini oluseduze** - The text says the near side is about 70km across, but doesn't say the *qweqwe* is on that side.
*   **B: Lapho khona kunezindawo zasenyangeni eziningi ezimnyama** - While the text mentions dark lunar spots, it doesn't link them to where the *qweqwe* is.
*   **D: Ngaphansi kwendawo yasenyangeni emnyama** - Similar to B, dark lunar spots aren't where the *qweqwe* is located.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okukholelwa abantu abathile?","The correct answer is **D: Kunama miles angaphansi kwayi-trillion phakathi nezinkanyezi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izinkanyezi zisakazeke kakhulu kangangokuthi kunezigidigidikazi zamamayela bakwathi kwezinkanyezi """"ezingomakhelwane""""."" This directly implies that the distances between stars are *extremely* large – measured in trillions of miles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abantu bahambe babona izinkanyezi** – The passage talks about *dreaming* of visiting stars, not actually having done so.
*   **B: Abantu ngeke bakwazi ukubona imihlaba ekhona** – The passage expresses hope and possibility of seeing other worlds.
*   **C: Ukuphila kukhona ngenxa yezinye izitshalo** – The passage refers to the possibility of life on other planets, not specifically related to plants.



"
Ikuphi okunciphayo mawukususa kude maphakathi kwelanga?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Gas**.

The text states: ""IGesi iba yincane njengoba uhamba uqhela enkabeni yeLanga."" which translates to ""Gas becomes less dense as you travel towards the center of the Sun.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: iPlasma** - While the sun *contains* plasma, the text doesn't say plasma decreases as you move inwards.
*   **B: Umlilo** (Fire) - The sun is made *of* fire (and plasma), but the text doesn't describe it decreasing.
*   **D: Uqweqwe** (Earth) - Earth is not relevant to the question about the sun's composition.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yiluphi uhlangothi lwelanga oluvela emhlabeni?","The correct answer is **C: iPhotosphere**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ingxenye engaphandle esiyibonayo lapho sibuka iLanga ibizwa ngokuthi yi-photosphere, okusho ukuthi “indilinga yokukhanya”.""  This directly answers the question of which part of the sun we see from Earth."
Yikuphi okulandelayo okubhekiwe kusize kwaqinisekisa umbono kaCopernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Izigaba zeVenus**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Izigaba zeVenus zisekela inkolelo-mbono kaCopenicus yokuthi amapulanethi azungeza ilanga."" (The phases of Venus support Copernicus's belief that planets revolve around the sun).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuhamba kweVenus (The path of Venus):** While Horrocks *observed* the path of Venus, the passage doesn't state his observation directly supported Copernicus's view. It just says he observed it.
* **C: Ukufana okukhona phakathi kweLanga neVenus (The similarity between the Sun and Venus):** The passage doesn't mention any similarities being used as support.
* **D: Ukufana okukhona phakathi kweNyanga neLanga (The similarity between the Moon and the Sun):** The passage uses the *analogy* of the Moon's phases to *explain* Venus's phases, but doesn't say a similarity *supports* the Copernican view.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwabonwa uGalileo Galilei ngo-1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Izigaba zeVenus**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Cishe eminyakeni eyizinkulungwane ezintathu kamuva, ngo-1610, isazi sezinkanyezi somNtaliyane uGalileo Galilei wasebenzisa i-telescope ukubuka ukuthi **iVenus inezigaba**, njengoba nenyanga inazo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhlangothi lweNyanga elibhekene Nelanga** - The passage mentions the Moon's phases as a comparison to Venus, but Galileo didn't *discover* that side of the moon.
*   **C: Amaplanethi azungeza ilanga** - Galileo's observation *supported* Copernicus's theory about planets orbiting the sun, but he didn't directly observe that planets orbit the sun in 1610.
*   **D: Ukuhamba kweVenus** - This was observed by Jeremiya Horrocks, not Galileo."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iAmazon River iwathatha kuphi amanzi?","The correct answer is **A: Imifula emincane** (Tributary rivers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uqoqa amanzi kusuka emifudlaneni eyizinkulungwane."" which translates to ""It collects water from thousands of tributaries."" Tributary rivers are smaller rivers that flow into a larger river.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umfula omude kunawo wonke** (The longest river) - The passage compares it to the second longest, not *from* the longest.
*   **C: Izilwandle** (The oceans) - The passage states water *flows to* the oceans *from* the Amazon, not the other way around.
*   **D: Umfula wesibili omkhulu** (The second largest river) - The passage compares it to the second largest, not that it takes water *from* it."
Ikujphi ukuhlonishwa okungabangelwanga i-Amazon River?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfula omude**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""UMfula i-Amazon ngumfula wesibili omude nomkhulu kunayo yonke eMhlabeni."" (The Amazon is the *second longest* river in the world.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imfula wesibili omude kunawo wonke** - The passage explicitly *states* this is a characteristic of the Amazon.
* **B: Umfula omkhulu** - The passage explicitly *states* this is a characteristic of the Amazon.
* **D: Umfula ovulekile** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the Amazon being ""open"" or wide. It *does* say it is the widest river, but ""ovulekile"" doesn't capture that meaning.

Therefore, the only descriptor *not* directly attributed to the Amazon River in the passage is simply ""umfula omude"" (a long river) - since it's specifically the *second* longest."
Yimuphi umsebenzi okukhulunywa ngakho emushweni ongaqashi inani lanasebenzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Amafuthi**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""nakuba iphesenti ililodwa kuphela lisebenza embonini kawoyela"" which translates to ""although only one percent works in the oil industry.""  This means the passage acknowledges the oil industry but *doesn't* state the exact number of people employed in it.

The other options *do* have numbers associated with them:

*   **A: Ezolimo (Agriculture):**  ""ingxenye yesithathu isebenza kwezokulima"" (""one-third works in agriculture"")
*   **B: Umkhakha (Industry):** ""cishe ingxenye yesine isebenza ezimbonini"" (""about one-fourth works in industry"")
*   **D: Inkonzo (Service Sector):** ""ingxenye yesithathu kwezimbili yabantu baseVenezuela abasebenzayo basebenza emkhakheni wokukhonza"" (""two-thirds of employed Venezuelans work in the service sector"")



"
"Ngokuya kwesiqephu, iyiphi imikhakha elandelayo eqasha inani labantu abanengi eVenezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Inkonzo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ingxenye yesithathu kwezimbili yabantu baseVenezuela abasebenzayo basebenza emkhakheni wokukhonza..."" This translates to ""Two-thirds of employed Venezuelans work in the service sector."" This is a larger proportion than those in agriculture (one-third), industry (approximately one-quarter), or oil (one percent).
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuhlangana kuvumelana izinkanyezi ukuba zenze ini?","The correct answer is **C: Kukhipha ukukhanya nokushisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izinkanyezi zikhipha ukukhanya nokushisa ngenxa yamandla enzekayo lapho ama-athomu e-hydrogen ahlangana (noma axubana) ndawonye ukwakha izakhi ezisinda kakhudlwana.""  This directly says that stars *emit light and heat* because of fusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwenza izakhi ezisindayo** - While fusion *creates* heavier elements, the passage says the light and heat are the result of the process, not the making of the elements themselves.
*   **B: Ukwakha ama-fusion reactors** - Scientists are *trying* to make fusion reactors, but the passage doesn't say fusion *allows* for their creation.
*   **D: Ukwenza ama-hydrogen athomu** - Fusion actually *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuyi fusion reactor okungabalusizo ekwenzeni ini?,"The correct answer is **A: iHydrogen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that fusion happens when hydrogen atoms combine. Scientists are trying to build a fusion reactor to *replicate* this process.  Therefore, hydrogen is the crucial ingredient for a fusion reactor to work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Izinkanyezi (Stars)** - Stars *use* fusion, they aren't what a reactor needs to be made *of*.
*   **C: Ama-athomu (Atoms)** - While fusion involves atoms, it specifically mentions hydrogen atoms.
*   **D: Amandla (Energy)** - Energy is the *result* of fusion, not the input material.



"
Iyiphi ikhemikhali edala amanzi?,"The correct answer is **D: Amahydrogen athomu amabili ne-yodwa iathomu ye-oksijini** (Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

The text states: ""Ingxube yamanzi yenziwe ama-athomu amabili we-hydrogen kanye ne-athomu elilodwa le-oxygen."" This translates directly to ""A water mixture is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"
"Uma manzi ashintsha isimo sawo, yini engashintshi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukhwakheka kwama-ngqamuzana** (The structure of the molecules).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Anokwakhekwa kwengqamuzana okufanayo kungakhathaliseki ukuthi ayigesi, uketshezi, noma aqinile.""  This means the molecular structure *remains the same* regardless of whether water is a gas, liquid, or solid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukusinda** (Existence) - While water continues to exist, the passage focuses on what *specifically* doesn't change.
* **C: Isimo sawo** (Its state) - The passage clearly states the physical state *does* change (gas, liquid, solid).
* **D: I-nitrogen eyimamanzi** (Watery nitrogen) - Nitrogen is used as an example of something that remains chemically the same regardless of state, but it's not directly related to the question about water.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo kwakungeyona ikinga nge-sizwe seshumi nantathu njengoba kuzama ukuphoqa umthetho?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuswela amandla phakathi kwenhlangano** (Lack of cohesion among the states).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Articles of Confederation government ""relied on the states, which often disagreed, to enforce its few laws."" This directly points to a lack of unity and cohesion between the states as a major problem in enforcing laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukugadwa okukhulu okubuya emthethweni wesizwe** (A large return to national law): The passage actually describes a *weak* national government, not a strong return to it.
*   **C: Imithetho edinga ukuvunyelwa abantu abangaziwa** (Laws requiring approval from unfamiliar people): While the passage mentions unanimous consent was needed from states, it doesn't frame it as approval from ""unfamiliar people.""
*   **D: Isikhulu sezwe esingekho** (Absent national executive): While the Confederation lacked a strong executive, the main issue highlighted in the passage regarding law enforcement is the states' *disagreement* and *lack of cooperation*, not simply the absence of an executive.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuphi okuyiqiniso okuveza imiso sikahumeleni phakathi nesikhati nempi yokulwela Inkuleleko?","The correct answer is **C: Abameli besizwe bebeshoda ngokuma kwabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...izifunda zithathe uhulumeni omkhulu njengongabalulekile kakhulu kangangokuba abameleli bazo babehlala bangekho."" This directly translates to ""the states took the central government as unimportant to the point that its representatives were often absent."" This demonstrates a lack of commitment and consensus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage actually states Congress *lacked* the power to tax effectively.
*   **B:** The passage mentions reliance on state governments for enforcement, not that laws depended on provincial authorities.
*   **D:** While the government was weak, the passage doesn't frame it as being divided into two parts. It describes a central government struggling to gain authority over the states.



"
Amazwi asemuva kweDeclaration of Independence abhalwe kanjani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ibheke phansi** (It faces downwards).

The passage specifically states: ""The script from the end of the document looks downwards."" This directly answers the question.
"
ISingapore idume ngaziphi izinto ezilandelayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Idholobha elehlaza mgombala (Garden City)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the botanic gardens helped transform Singapore into a ""Garden City."" The other options are not mentioned in the text.



"
Yini iVanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Imbali**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, iorchid hybrid, yakhethwa njengendaba yezwe"" which translates to ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the national flower."" Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isiqhingi** - The passage mentions the gardens helping transform a swamp, but Vanda Miss Joaquim isn't a swamp itself.
*   **C: Ingadi yezimila** - The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a garden, but Vanda Miss Joaquim is a plant *within* the garden, not the garden itself.
*   **D: Indawo yezwe ehlonishwayo** - While it *represents* a national symbol, it *is* the national flower, not just a respected place.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi esimo seGiza pyramids ebesengeke sicaze i-New Kingdom Egyptians?","The correct answer is **C: Usayizi wabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in the beauty of their construction."" This means that the New Kingdom Egyptians were impressed by the *size* of the pyramids, as nothing they built came close to matching it. The passage also notes the pyramids were over a thousand years old at the time, implying their age was also a factor in how the Egyptians perceived them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iminyaka yabo (Their age):** While the passage mentions the pyramids were ancient, it's not the primary thing that left the New Kingdom Egyptians in awe.
*   **B: Ukusebenzisa itshe (Using stone):** Building with stone was common in ancient Egypt; the pyramids weren't unique in that regard.
*   **D: Ukwakha kwabo (Their construction):** The passage states the beauty of their *construction* was never surpassed, but the question asks what the New Kingdom Egyptians were impressed by overall, and the size is more prominent.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, izilwane ezidla uhlaza zisuka kuphi ukuze zithole imvula?","The correct answer is **B: Izintaba zenyakatho**.

The passage states: ""...izilwane ezidla imifino ezicishe zibe yizigidi ezingu-1,5 ziyahamba zibheke emathafeni aseningizimu, ziwela uMfula i-Mara, zisuka **emagqumeni asenyakatho** ukuze zitole imvula."" 

This directly indicates the animals come from the northern grounds to find rain."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi indawo lapho izilwane ezidla imifino eziyishiyayo ngo-April?","The correct answer is **A: Indawo yaseSerengeti**.

Here's why:

The text states the animals cross the Mara River *back* into the Serengeti area (""emava enyakatho ngasentshonalanga, ukweqa umfula iMara futhi, ngemva kwezimvula cishe zango April""). This indicates they are returning *to* the Serengeti region after being south of the river.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amathafa aseningizimu:** They are *leaving* the southern plains in October, not staying there in April.
*   **C: uMfula i-Mara:** The Mara River is a boundary they cross, not a destination.
*   **D: IMaasai Mara National Reserve:** While part of the Serengeti ecosystem, the text doesn't specify they *stay* in the Maasai Mara in April, but rather that they cross the Mara River to return to the larger Serengeti area.



"
Uhlelo lweSealion bewukuvinjezelwa kwayiphi ilizwe?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Britain**.

The text states: ""Germany began preparing to invade the coast of Britain. The Germans called the invasion 'Operation Sealion'."" This clearly indicates Operation Sealion was planned as an invasion of Britain."
Ukuhlaselwa kwamaBrithani iJalimane yakubuza ngokuthi yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Uhlelo lweSealion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Germany began preparing to invade Britain and the Germans named the invasion with a menacing name, **“Operation Sealion”**."" The question asks what the Germans *called* their planned invasion of Britain. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uDunkirk** - Dunkirk was where British forces *escaped* to, it wasn't the name of the invasion.
*   **C: i-Kriegsmarine** - This is the German Navy, not the name of the invasion.
*   **D: i-Royal Navy** - This is the British Navy, and it's mentioned as a defense *against* the invasion, not the name of it.



"
Yini okungavezwanga njengoba kusinyathelo esibalukile ohlelweni lwase-Italy lokuvimbezela amazwe wase-Africa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwakha imikhumbu eningeleziwe** (Building new ships).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Italy built four new ships *before* the war, but also notes those ships were ""weak."" The passage emphasizes that Italy's main goals were in Africa and required a staging point for troops, meaning they needed to eliminate British presence in the Mediterranean (specifically, neutralizing British ships and bases in Egypt) to get there. Building new, yet ineffective, ships wasn't presented as a critical step in their plan for African conquest.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as important:

*   **A: Ukususa amikhumbi yaseGibhite** (Removing Egyptian ships) - The passage mentions the need to neutralize British ships/bases in Egypt (which controls the Suez Canal) as a prerequisite for attacking Africa.
*   **C: Ukusungula indawo lapho amasosha azosukela khona** (Establishing a place for soldiers to depart from) - The passage states they needed a staging area for troops heading to Africa.
*   **D: Ukumosha isisekelo samaNgisi** (Overthrowing the English base) - The passage states the need to neutralize British ships and bases to be able to invade Africa."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kwakuyini umgomo we-Italy ngempi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthumba izizwe zase-Africa** (To conquer nations in Africa).

The passage explicitly states: ""Izinhloso eziphambili zase-Italy kwakungamazwe ase-Afrika."" (The main goals of Italy were the nations of Africa). The rest of the text explains how they planned to achieve this goal, needing a base to launch attacks. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukwakha amasosha aqinile kuhlanganise nawasolwandle** (To build strong armies including navies) - The passage says their armies and navies were *weak*.
* **C: Ukuqeda ngemikhumbi yaseGibhithe** (To eliminate Egyptian ships) - Eliminating British and Egyptian ships was a *step* towards their goal of conquering Africa, not the goal itself.
* **D: Ukusungula isisekelo samaNgisi** (To establish an English base) - Italy was fighting *against* the British, not trying to help them.



"
Ubani owasungula ubudlelwane bobungani nabahlaseli?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Vichy French**.

The text specifically states that the ""Vichy French"" made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the enemy instead of fighting them. This establishes them as the collaborators.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Germans:** They were the aggressors, not the ones forming a friendly relationship *with* them.
*   **C: AmaMelika:** They were fighting *against* the Germans and Vichy French.
*   **D: i-Free French:** They were fighting *against* the Germans and Vichy French.



"
Obani okungabasizi lohlelo lweDragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: AmaMelika neFree French**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...amasosha ase-Melika kanye nawase-French Ekhululekile akhiphe iningizimu France...""  This means American and Free French forces were the ones carrying out Operation Dragoon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: AmaVichy French nama-Americans:** The Vichy French were being *fought against*, not participating in the operation.
*   **C: AmaJalimane namaFulentshi:** The Germans were the target, and the Vichy French collaborated with them.
*   **D: AmaMelika namaJalimane:** The Americans were attacking the Germans."
Ukuthuthukiswa kwezobucwepheshe kubangele ukuba ama-submarine akwazi ukuhamba ngaphansi kwamanzi?,"The correct answer is **D: iRadar**.

Here's why:

The passage states that as detection technology (""redded and grew more sophisticated"") improved, submarines were *forced* to travel underwater to avoid being seen. This implies that the development of technology, specifically detection technology like radar, drove the need for submarines to stay submerged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-U-Boats:** These are just the German submarines, not the technological development itself.
*   **B: Ibanga elidubulekayo (Firing range):** The passage mentions firing range, but it doesn't say its improvement caused submarines to go underwater.
*   **C: Ukuqondiswa kwendlela (Navigation):** While important, improved navigation didn't *force* them to submerge; it just helped them do it more effectively.



"
"Ukusetshenjiwa kwawo kokuqala, ama-submarine bekanobubanzi obulinganiswe kuyiphi indawo?","The correct answer is **B: Ohambayo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ekuqaleni kwempi yahamba kancane kakhulu futhi beyikwazi ukudubula ibanga elifishane."" This directly refers to the early submarines being **slow-moving** (ohambayo).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ufuna indlela (Navigation)** - While submarines need navigation, the text doesn't focus on that as their initial limitation.
*   **C: Ukudubula (Shooting/Range)** - The text *does* mention limited range, but describes speed as the primary initial drawback.
*   **D: Ukusebenza (Functionality)** - This is too general. The text is specific about *how* they functioned poorly initially (slowly).



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owaphula isivumelwano? ","The correct answer is **D: I-Soviet**.

The passage states that the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland, *breaking* the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other peace treaties. This clearly indicates the Soviet Union was the party that violated the agreements.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwathwalwa iRed Army?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuhlwa kabusha ngasohlangathini lwekhanda lebhuloho** (Re-establishing on the head of the spear).

Here's why:

The passage describes the Red Army *entering* Belarus and Ukraine and *attacking* eastern Poland. It details their actions like violating treaties. 

*   **A: Ukwenziwa kwe-Ukrainian front** (Establishment of the Ukrainian front) - This is a logical consequence of the Red Army entering Ukraine.
*   **B: Ukuvinjezelwa kwezizwe ezise-mpumalanga** (Encroachment of the eastern nations) - This describes the effect of the Red Army's actions.
*   **D: Ukuphulwa kwesivumelwano** (Breaching of the treaty) - This is a direct action *taken* by the Red Army, as stated in the passage.

However, ""Ukuhlwa kabusha ngasohlangathini lwekhanda lebhuloho"" (Re-establishing on the head of the spear) doesn't relate to anything described in the passage. It's a tactical military phrase not mentioned in the context of the Red Army's invasion of Poland.



"
Kwenzekani ngoEngineer-in-Chief we-Italian Tenth Army?,"The correct answer is **C: Wabanjwa amaNgisi**.

The text states: ""abazali beBhrithani bathumba uNjiniyela Oyinhloko weButho Leshumi womNtaliyane, uJenene Lastucci"" which translates to ""the British captured the Chief Engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.""



"
Wabulawela kuphi uItalo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Ngomhlaka 28 kuNhlangulana 28, u-Marshal Italo Balbo, uMbusi-Jikelele wase-Libya futhi obonakala eyindlalifa ka-Musolini, wabulawa ngephutha ngozakwabongenkathi efika e-Tobruk ngendiza."" This directly states he was killed in Tobruk."
"Ngokuya kwaloshu, iziphi izindlela ezilandelayo okuyinto ebalulekile yokuzindla kweTibetan?","The correct answer is **C: Ukubona ngeso lenqgondo izinkolo** (Visualizing deities).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ngokubona ngeso lengqondo izithixo ezahlukahlukene imizila yamandla iba ehlanzekile, ama-chakra enziwa ukuthi asebenze futhi ukukhanya kokubakhona kuyakhiwa."" (By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the light of being is built.)  This makes visualization (seeing deities in the mind's eye) the central practice of Tibetan meditation as described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly the *central* practice:

*   **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukuphefumula** (Practicing breathing) - While Kundalini Yoga *includes* breathwork, the passage doesn't present it as the core of Tibetan meditation itself, but as a tool *within* Kundalini Yoga.
*   **B: Ukuphinda amazwibela** (Repeating mantras) -  Similar to breathwork, mantras are *part* of the practices, but not highlighted as the central method.
*   **D: Ukwazi kahle ukuma kwe-yoga** (Mastering yoga postures) -  The text mentions Kundalini Yoga, but focuses on the energy work aspects rather than the physical postures.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ama-chakras avuleka kanjani “phakathi” nokuzindla kweTibetan?","The correct answer is **B: Ngokubona ngeso lenqgondo izinkolo**

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ngokubona ngeso lengqondo izithixo ezahlukahlukene imizila yamandla iba ehlanzekile, ama-chakra enziwa ukuthi asebenze futhi ukukhanya kokubakhona kuyakhiwa."" (By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the light of being is built.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuma okuhlukahlukene kwe-yoga** - While yoga is mentioned, it's specifically regarding Kundalini energy, not direct chakra activation during meditation.
*   **C: Ukuphinda phinda amazwibela** - Mantras are part of the practice, but not the primary way chakras are activated according to this text.
*   **D: Ukuphrakthiza ukuphefumula** - Breathing exercises are part of Kundalini Yoga, but not the focus of the Tibetan meditation practice described here.



"
Ubuni othule ingoma yesibili phakathi nomhlangano?,"The correct answer is **D: uJai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umculi uSanju Sharma bekunguye oqalile kusihlwa, *elandelwa* uJai Shankar Choudhary."" This means Jai Shankar Choudhary performed *second*, therefore he sang the second song.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani othule ingoma ngesikhathi kunikelwa ukudla?","The correct answer is **A: uLakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""U-Lakkha Singh uholile ekuculeni i-bhajans."" and ""U-Lakkha Singh wanikezela ngange-Chhappan bhog bhajan."" This means Lakkha Singh led the singing during the offering of the Chhappan Bhog (food).



"
Ubani odlale ekugcineni ebusuku?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo wase-Anatolia**.

The passage states: ""Ukuqedela, iqembu labadansi laseTheki uMlilo ka-Anatolia lenza umboniso we-“Troy”."" This means they performed last."
Uvela kuliphi izwe uAlessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: IsiNtaliyane (Italian)**.

The text states ""Ukuqedela, iqembu labadansi laseTheki uMlilo ka-Anatolia lenza umboniso we-“Troy”. Isihlabani somculo saseTheki uSezen Aksu ucule nomculi wetena u-Alessandro Safina nomculi womGriki uHaris Alexiou."" 

While performing *with* a Turkish singer and a Greek singer, Alessandro Safina is identified as a tenor - with no mention of his nationality. However, Alessandro Safina is a well-known Italian tenor.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, isiphi isitatimende okungesona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **A: Bekunomlilo eSanta Clara**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states there was a heatwave in Santa Clara (90°F), not a fire.** Captain Kouns describes the difficulty of staying in a *hot* train car, not escaping a fire.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **B: Abantu bebemile ku-roller coaster** - The passage mentions the people were waiting in a train car at an amusement park, which implies a roller coaster.
*   **C: Abagibeli bebenikwe amanzi** - The first sentence directly states this.
*   **D: Kuthethe imizuzu eyi-60 ukuze bakhiphe umgibeli okuqala** - The captain says it took ""at least an hour"" to remove the first person, which is 60 minutes.

"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owabeka umbono mayelana namazinga okushisa angathandeki?","The correct answer is **B: Ukaputeni womlilo**.

The passage specifically states: ""Ukeputeni wezomlilo uScott Kouns uthe, """"Bekuwusuku olushisayo eSanta Clara ngamazinga okushiwa ako-90..."""""". This clearly indicates Captain Kouns expressed the opinion about the heat."
Ugesi ucime kuphi ngenxa kokubakhona kwe-tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: isiTonga**.

The text specifically states: ""Awukho umonakalo omkhulu noma ukulimala okubikiwe eTonga, kodwa ugesi ubungekho okwesikhashana..."" (There was no major damage or injuries reported in Tonga, but the power was out briefly...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: i-Niue** - The text mentions a tsunami was recorded *near* Niue, but doesn't say the power went out there.
* **C: Izikole eziseHawaii** - The schools were closed as a precaution, but the text doesn't say the power went out at the schools.
* **D: i-Pago Pago** - A tsunami was recorded near Pago Pago, but the text doesn't mention power outages there.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iTonga yathinteka kanjani ekuhambeni kukagesi?","The correct answer is **D: Iziphathimandla azikwazanga ukuthola ukuxwayisa okudingekile**.

The passage specifically states: ""...ukuthi kuvimebele iziphathimandla zaseTonga ekutholeni isexwayiso setsunami esikhishwe iPTWC."" This directly translates to ""that prevented Tonga authorities from receiving the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwabikwa ukumosheka kwezinto** - The passage doesn't mention any damage.
*   **B: Iziphathi mandla azange zathole izindaba mayelana nokuxwayiswa** - While similar to the correct answer, the passage specifies they couldn't *receive* the warning, not that they didn't get *news* about it.
*   **C: Ukubikwa kwezinga lolwandle kwathinteka** - The passage refers to sea levels showing a tsunami *happened*, not that reporting of sea levels was affected."
Kunini lapho amaphoyisa akwazi ukusebenzisa izibhamu zabo zokubona isivivini sika Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Njengoba bekahamba u160km/h**.

The text states: ""okuwukuphela kwesikhathi lapho amaphoyisa ekwaze ukubona isivinini sikaMnu Reid bekuyilapho enciphisa isivinini eya ku-160km/h."" This means they could only get a reading *when* he slowed down to 160km/h.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngesikhathi sesikhombisa ngemva kwebhuloho:** The text doesn't specify they got a reading on the seventh pass.
* **C: Njengoba bekahamba ngesivinini esingaphezu kwe-160km/h:** The text explicitly states they *couldn't* read his speed when he was going faster.
* **D: Okokuqala ahamba phezu kwaleli bhuloho:** The text doesn't mention when they first attempted to read his speed."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani kwakunzima ngamaphoyisa ase-New Zealand ukuba abone isivinini sikaJonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Imoto beyihamba kancani**.

The text states: ""Amaphoyisa aseNyuzilandi abenenkinga yokusebenzisa izibhamu zawo zokubona isivinini ukubona ukuthi uMnu Reid wayeshesha kangakanani ngenxa yendlela i-Black Beauty ephansi ngayo..."" This means the car was so low to the ground that the speed cameras had difficulty detecting it.
"
Ukuzama zama komhlaba bekukuphi eButte?,"The correct answer is **B: Amamayela angu-40 eningizimu**.

The passage states the earthquake was approximately 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte."
Kwenzekani ngesiteleka esiseAbu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlukunyezwa kwesiboshwa (Prisoner abuse)**.

The passage specifically states that the Abu Ghraib prison became notorious *after* the discovery of prisoner abuse by US soldiers. This is the key event associated with the prison.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuvalwa thaqa kwezwe (National closure):** The passage doesn't mention the prison being closed down.
* **C: Amabutho ase-US aqala ukulawula (US troops begin to rule):**  While US troops were present, the passage focuses on what *happened* within the prison under their control, not a general takeover.
* **D: Ijele lashiswa (The prison was burned down):** The passage doesn't mention the prison being burned.



"
Kungani ijele lase Iraqi naqala ukusatshwa kakhulu? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ukutholwa kokuhlukunyezwa kweziboshwa (The discovery of prisoner abuse)**.

The passage explicitly states that the prison gained notoriety *after* the abuse of prisoners by US soldiers was revealed. This is the primary reason for the negative attention the prison received.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lashiswa (It was burned)** - The passage doesn't mention the prison being burned.
*   **B: Amautho wase-US aqala ukulawula (US authorities began to control it)** - While US authorities *were* involved, the control itself didn't cause the notoriety – the abuse did.
*   **C: Bekuneziteleka eziningi (There were many thefts)** - Theft isn't mentioned in the passage as a reason for the prison's negative reputation.



"
Hlobo luni lomcimbi okwakumelwe libe khona eMaui's War Memorial Stadium?,"The correct answer is **C: Ikhonsathi**. 

The passage states the group *hosted a show* at the stadium. A ""show"" in this context most logically refers to a concert. The other options aren't indicated by the text."
Ubani owanikeza isizathu mayelana nokukhanselwa komcimbi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikhampani yabaphathi**.

Here's why:

The text states ""iHK Ubuphathi Inc., ayinikanga isizathu sasekuqaleni sokukhansela... kodwa yasola izizathu ezingokomsebenzi ngosuku olulandelayo."" This translates to ""HK Management Inc., did not initially give a reason for the cancellation... but blamed logistical reasons the next day.""  Therefore, the management company provided the reason (eventually).



"
Abahlali abambalwa beBishkek bacabanga ukuthi ubani imbangela yokuphanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ababikishi** (Protesters).

The text states: ""Abahlali abaningana baseBishkek bathwese ababhikishi abasuka eningizimu icala lokwephulwa komthetho.""  This directly translates to ""Several residents of Bishkek blamed the protesters from the south for the looting.""

Therefore, the residents blamed the protesters for the looting.



"
Obani abasole ababikishi ababuya ngase-ningizimu ngokuphanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Abahlali beBishkek**.

The text states: ""Abahlali abaningana baseBishkek bathwese ababhikishi abasuka eningizimu icala lokwephulwa komthetho.""  This directly translates to ""Several residents of Bishkek accused the protesters from the south of violating the law (looting).""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek are the ones accusing the protesters of looting.



"
Kunini lapho uRing ebona ukunyuka kwama kwezokuthengisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngemva kokuvela kuShark Tank**.

The passage states: ""USminoff uthe izintengo zanyuka ngemva kokuvela kwakhe embukwisweni we-Shark Tank ngo-2013..."" (Siminoff said prices rose after his appearance on Shark Tank in 2013...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngemva kokuthola imali ngo2013:** The passage specifically says the panel *rejected* funding, so they didn't receive money.
* **C: Ngemva kokuvela kuQVC:** While QVC is mentioned, the passage doesn't say sales increased *because* of it.
* **D: Ngemva kokuthengi i-lawsuit neADT:** The passage mentions the lawsuit resolution, but not a resulting sales increase.



"
Kunini lapho uJamie Simioff ecabange ukuqala iRing?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngemva kokubona ukuthi isicabha sakhe asisafaneleki** (After noticing his doorbell was no longer sufficient).

The passage states: ""Phambilini, isikhulu esiphezulu sakwa-Ring, u-Jamie Siminoff, sathi le nkampani yaqala ngenkathi kungezwakali ukuthi kukhona ongqongqozayo emnyango uma esesitolo sakhe esisegalaji lakhe."" This translates to: ""Previously, Ring's chief executive, Jamie Siminoff, said the company started when he realized there wasn't anyone at his door when he was at his locksmith shop."" 

This indicates he started the company because of an issue with his own doorbell/security.



"
Uhlelo ngalunye lweReading Rainbow linikeze abantwana maphi amacebiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Izincwadi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uhlelo ngalunye luzotusa izincwadi lezo izingane okumelwe zizibheke lapho ziye elabhulali yazo."" This directly translates to ""Each program will feature books for children to look for when they go to their library.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amahlelo akuthelevishini (Television programs)** - The passage discusses the show itself, but doesn't say it gave advice *about* television programs.
*   **B: Umtapo wezincwadi emphakathini (Community library)** - While the passage mentions going to the library, the show provided guidance *about books to find* at the library, not advice about the library itself.
*   **C: Ama-Themes (Themes)** - The show focused *on* themes, but didn't necessarily give advice *about* them, only explored them through stories and books.



"
Yini eyaholela ekuthenini ihlelo leReading Rainbow livalwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukungabi nemali eyanele** (Lack of funding).

The passage states: ""Kukholelwa abanye, kuhlanganise noJohn Grant, ukuthi **ukusweleka okukhulu kwemali** kanye nokushintsha kwefilosofi yezinhlelo zemfundo zethelevishini kube nomthelela ekupheleni kwezinhlelo ezilandelanayo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukungatholi umtlomelo we-Emmy** - The passage actually says Reading Rainbow *won* over twenty-four Emmy Awards.
*   **C: Umbono kaJohn Grant** - John Grant is quoted as saying the show *inspired* reading, not that his opinion caused its cancellation.
*   **D: Ukuphumelela komakhelwane ka numzane uRogers** - The passage doesn't suggest that the success of Mister Rogers's Neighborhood led to Reading Rainbow's cancellation.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo kwakungekona ukubanga okwenziwa abaphathi be-Amsterdam nemnuziyamu maqondana nesihlahla?,"The correct answer is **B: Kumelwe igcinwe (It must be preserved)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the city and museum believe the tree is dangerous and at risk of falling. They *planned to cut it down*.  Therefore, wanting to *preserve* it is the opposite of their actions and beliefs.

Let's look at why the other options *are* actions they took or beliefs they expressed:

*   **A: Ukugcineni izowa (Saving seeds)** - This is a plausible action to take *after* considering removing the tree – to preserve its genetics.
*   **C: Kumoshakele kunefungus (It is rotting with fungus)** - The passage states the tree is unstable, which could be *because* of rot and fungus.
*   **D: Iyingozi ezimpiweni zabantu (It is dangerous to people's health)** - The passage specifically says the tree is a safety hazard to the public.



"
"Ngokuya kwesikhulu esihlolayo seRSPCA, ukuhlola kumelwe kube into ekhona njalo ngenxa yaziphi izizathu ezilandelayo?","The correct answer is **B: Khona osebenza ngezilwane**.

Here's why:

The text states that David O’Shannessy believes CCTV will ""send a strong signal to those people who work with animals that their welfare is paramount."" This means the regular monitoring is *for* the benefit of animal welfare, specifically impacting those who work with animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ama-khamera weCCTV** – CCTV is a *tool* for monitoring, not the reason *why* monitoring should be regular.
*   **C: Ukufaka kwamakhamera wokugada** – This describes the action of installing cameras, not the reasoning behind regular inspections.
*   **D: Indawo yokuhlinza** – This isn't mentioned in the provided text.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini engasiza iqinise ukubaluleka kwenhlalakahle yezilalwane kubahlinzi base-Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ukufakwa kwama khamera yeCCTV**.

Here's why:

The excerpt directly states: ""CCTV nakanjani izothumela isibonakaliso esinamandla kulabo bantu abasebenza ngezilwane sokuthi inhlalakahle yabo iyinto eza kuqala kunazo zonke."" (CCTV will certainly send a strong signal to those people who work with animals that their welfare comes first.)

The other options are not mentioned in the excerpt as ways to ensure the welfare of animals:

*   **B:** Meetings with the RSPCA are not mentioned.
*   **C:** Regular inspections are mentioned as something *needed*, but the CCTV is presented as the tool to *ensure* welfare is prioritized.
*   **D:** Coverage on ABC is just where the information is reported, not a solution itself."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, uyini umsebenzi womuntu oboshiwe?","The correct answer is **A: Umfundi (Student)**.

The passage states: ""...omunye umfundi ubanjiwe ngokuhlobene nokudubula kwasesikoleni..."" which directly translates to ""...one **student** was arrested in connection with the school shooting..."""
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, njengoba izindaba bezigcwele ngokunye ukuboshwa,kwakukhona imigcwabo yezisulu eziyingakhi?","The correct answer is **B: Kuthathu**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...izinkonzo zemingcwabo kaJeff Weise kanye *nezisulu ezintathu* kweziyisishiyagalolunye..."" which translates to ""...funeral services for Jeff Weise and *three victims* of the fourteen...""

Therefore, there were funerals for three victims."
"Ngokuphendula isiteleka, yiliphi izwe elingazange liqhubeke ngesivumelwano esisayiniwe seACTA?","The correct answer is **B: i-Poland**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngenyanga edlule, bekunokubhikisha okukhulu e-Poland lapho lelozwe lisayina i-ACTA, okwaholela ekubeni uhulumeni wase-Poland unqume ukungamukeli isivumelwano, okwamanje."" This directly indicates Poland signed ACTA but then *decided not to ratify* (accept) it due to protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Germany:** The text only mentions protests *in* Germany, not that it cancelled an ACTA agreement.
*   **C: i-Scotland:** The text mentions protests *in* Scotland, but does not say it cancelled any ACTA agreement.
*   **D: i-Lithuania:** The text only mentions protests *in* Lithuania, not that it cancelled an ACTA agreement.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yimaphi amazwe alandelayo anquma ukuyekela inqubo yokujoyina i-ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: i-Latvia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ILatvia neSlovakia zombili zilibazise inqubo yokujoyina i-ACTA."" which translates to ""Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining ACTA."" This indicates they have decided to pause or halt their intention to join.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Estonia** - The text only mentions protests in Tallinn, Estonia, but not that they halted joining ACTA.
*   **B: i-Lithuania** - The text only mentions protests in Vilnius, Lithuania, but not that they halted joining ACTA.
*   **C: i-Scotland** - The text mentions protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland, but not that Scotland as a nation halted joining ACTA.



"
Bangaki abantu abalimala ngemiphumela yokushisa kakhulu kwama iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""...and left four people slightly burned."" This directly answers the question about how many people were injured."
Ubani owathi izigameko zokushisa kakhulu azikababuleki?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Apple**.

The passage states: ""lezo inkampani ezibize ngokuthi """"into engeyona enkulu."""""". This directly means Apple downplayed the overheating incidents. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-METI:** METI was *critical* of Apple's response, calling it ""regrettable,"" not the one who minimized the issue.
*   **B: Abanikazi bama iPod bayathinteka:** The text doesn't state that the iPod owners are the ones who minimized the issue.
*   **C: Umnyango wezicisha mlilo eJapan:** The passage doesn't mention the fire department's opinion on the severity of the incidents.



"
"Phakathi nenkulumo, utheni uSteve Jobs nge-Apple mayelana nokwenziwa futhi?","The correct answer is **A: Umlando**.

Here's why:

The passage states Steve Jobs said, ""Namuhla i-Apple izokwakha ngenye indlela ifoni, **Sizokwenza umlando namuhla**"" (Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, **We're going to make history today**).  The question asks what he said *about* Apple doing. He said they were going to *make history*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: i-Phone** - He mentions the iPhone, but that's *what* they're making history *with*, not what he said they would do.
*   **C: Inkampani** - He doesn't say anything *about* the company itself in that quote.
*   **D: Ubuchwepheshe** - While the iPhone *is* technology, he doesn't specifically say they'll make history with technology – he says they’ll *make* history.



"
Kwakuyini injongo yenkulumo kaSteve Jobs yamahora amabili?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukukhipha i-phone entsha**.

The text explicitly states Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone during his speech and said, ""Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone."" This directly indicates the purpose of his two-hour speech was to launch a new phone.



"
Yini uCristina Fernandez de Krichner ayisho eArgentine Theatre?,"The correct answer is **A: Ithuba lakhe lokuba wumongameli**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""UNkk. Kirchner umemezelo inhloso yakhe yokukhankasela ukuba umongameli eThiyetheni yase-Ajenthina"" which translates to ""Ms. Kirchner announced her intention to campaign to be president at the Argentine Theatre.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umgome wakhe wokuhola iSenate** - The passage states she is running for *president*, not Senate.
*   **C: Ukhankasa wakhe wokunikezwa kwesifundazwe saseBeunos Aires** - The passage doesn't mention a campaign for the province of Buenos Aires at the theatre.
*   **D: Uhlelo lwakhe lokubeka phansi izintabo zokuba yisigela** - She has already *been* a Senator; this isn't what she announced at the theatre.



"
Usenze kuphi isaziso sakhe uFernandez de Kirchner sokufuna ukuphatha?,"The correct answer is **C: ETheatre yase Argentine eqele ngama mayili angu31 kusukela eBuenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the announcement was made in La Plata, which is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
* It also specifies that the location was a theatre. 
* Therefore, the most accurate description from the options provided is ""ETheatre yase Argentine eqele ngama mayili angu31 kusukela eBuenos Aires"".



"
Yini okutholwe yi-ACMA mayelana neBig Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Umthetho wokufihla ulwimi olungahlanzekile awuphulwanga** (The obscenity law was not broken).

Here's why:

The passage states that ACMA found Big Brother *did not* break internet broadcasting laws because the content wasn't permanently hosted on their website. This implies they weren't found to be in violation of obscenity laws related to online content.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izithombe namavidiyo kwatholwa kubekwe kuwubhusayithi yeBig Brother** (Photos and videos were found to be placed on the Big Brother website) - The passage explicitly states the opposite.
* **C: Imithetho wokufihla ulwimi olungahlanzekile iphuliwe** (Obscenity laws were broken) - The passage states they were *not* broken.
* **D: Udaba lwatholwa luhlezi ngokoqobo ku-server** (The matter was found to reside permanently on a server) - This is the reason they *didn't* break the law, it wasn't permanently hosted.



"
I-Media kumelwe ibe kuyiphi imincele ukuze kuthiwe izinto ze-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kumelwe ihlale ngokoqobo ku-server**.

The passage explicitly states: ""nokho ukuze kuthathwe njengokuqukethwe kwe-inthanethi, kumelwe kuhlale kuyi-server ngokoqobo."" (however, to be considered online content, it must reside on a real server).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kumelwe isakazwe ku-inthanethi** - While streaming is *a way* to access online content, it doesn't define what *makes* content online.
*   **C: Ayikwazi ukubekwa ku-webhusayithi** - The passage states the opposite – the content wasn't *on* the Big Brother website, and that's why it wasn't considered online content under the Act.
*   **D: Kumelwe igunyazwe yi-ACMA** - The passage doesn't mention ACMA needing to authorize content for it to be considered online. ACMA simply investigates breaches of the Broadcasting Services Act.



"
Ubani umholi weLiberal Party?,"The correct answer is **B: uJohn Howard**.

The passage states: ""...and a man frequently tipped to succeed Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal party..."" This clearly identifies John Howard as the leader of the Liberal Party. While Peter Costello is *tipped to succeed* him, he isn't currently the leader.



"
Kungani i-Australia inganawo imboni ye-nuclear?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuswela isekelo lomphakathi (Lack of public support)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Peter Costello saying ""That is, there is no principled objection to nuclear power"" *implying* that the only reason Australia doesn't have nuclear power is because of objections - likely from the public.  The passage doesn’t mention cost (D), safety (C), or significant disagreement amongst leaders (B). It frames the issue as a lack of acceptance, which points directly to public support.



"
Yimuphi umshushuluzu owaqeda ngosizo lweziqondiso?,"The correct answer is **C: uMaciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Umshushuluzi waseqhweni wase-Poland wesigaba sabesilisa abangaboni kahle u-Maciej Krezel **nomqondisi u-Anna Ogarzynska** uqede endaweni yeshumi nantathu kuyi-Super-G.""

This means Maciej Krezel needed the guidance of Anna Ogarzynska to complete the Super-G race. The other options are athletes who competed without mention of assistance."
Iliphi izwe laqeda endaweni yesishumi ku-Super-G yabesifazane?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Netherlands**.

The passage states: ""Bahlanganisa iNetherlands, ngo-Anna Jochemsen oqede endaweni yesishiyagalolunye esigabeni sabesifazane abamile kuyiSuper-G izolo..."" This means the Netherlands finished in 19th place in the women's Super-G. The question asks for the country that finished in 10th place. Katja Saarinen of Finland finished 10th in the same event.

Therefore, the answer is **B: i-Netherlands**."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okushiwo ngoBlake okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Wavuma ukuthi uhlaselile** (He admitted to assaulting someone).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Umsakazi, obekade eboshiwe endaweni yesigameko, ukuphikile ukuhlaselwa"" which translates to ""The broadcaster, who was arrested at the scene, **denied** the assault.""  Therefore, Blake *did not* admit to the assault.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Waboshelwa endaweni enze ikulo icala** (He was arrested at the scene of the crime) - The text states ""obekade eboshiwe endaweni yesigameko"" (who was arrested at the scene).
*   **C: Wasebenzisa ipali ukuze ashaye** (He used a long object to hit) - The text says ""uthi usebenzise uthi olude ukuzivikela"" (says he used a long object to defend himself).
*   **D: Uthe bebemujikijela ngamabhodlela** (He said he was pelted with bottles) - The text says ""uthi usebenzise uthi olude ukuzivikela emabhodleleni ayejikijelwa ngawo"" (says he used a long object to defend himself from bottles thrown at him)."
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, ikuphi okulandeyo okungenzekanga kuBlake?","The correct answer is **C: Wamuhlasela ngesigxobo**.

Here's why:

The passage states Blake used *a long knife* for self-defense against a crowd. It does *not* say he was attacked *with* a knife or a stabbing weapon.  The crowd were throwing things at him, he used the knife to defend himself.

Let's look at why the other options are possible:

*   **A: Watholwa anecala lokuziphatha okuphula umthetho** – He is accused of attempting to obstruct justice, which is unlawful behaviour.
*   **B: Waboshwa** – The passage explicitly states he was arrested at the scene.
*   **D: Watshelwa ukuthi amathuba wokuthi aye ejele manengi** – The judge told him it was ""virtually inevitable"" he would be sent to prison.



"
Ukutholwa kwemali Yenhlangano Yezizwe Ezihlangene yokufudumala kwembulunga ngeke isetshenziswe kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwabelana ngezobuchwepheshe ukusiza amazwe athuthukayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the UN fund will be used for:

*   ""izidlu ezingakhukhuleki"" (flood-resistant housing)
*   ""indlela yokuphatha amanzi engcono"" (better water management)
*   ""nezinhlobonhlobo zezitshalo"" (crop diversity)

It *doesn't* mention using the funds for sharing technology with developing countries. That topic is discussed separately in the first sentence as another agenda item for the Bali meeting, but not as a use for the fund.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi iNhlangano Yezizwe Ezihlangane efisa ukukusiza?","The correct answer is **A: Imali, ngokwabelana ngezobuchwepheshe** (Money, by sharing technology).

Here's why:

* The passage states the UN wants to ""establish a fund to help countries affected by global warming to cope with disasters.""  This directly refers to providing *financial* assistance.
* It also mentions ""sharing technology to help developing countries grow in less polluting ways.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izitshalo** (Plants) - While the fund *can* be used for crop diversity, it's not the primary focus of the UN's help.
* **C: Amahlathi womhlaba asele** (Remaining forests of the world) - Protecting forests is *a topic* of discussion at the Bali meeting, but not what the UN is directly offering assistance *for* in this passage.
* **D: Abantu abathinteka mayelana nendlela yokuphatha amanzi engcono** (People affected about better water management methods) - Better water management is *an example* of how the money could be used, but it's not who the UN is helping overall.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwacaphunwa u-Albert Muchanga njengento okumelwe idingwe sivumelane nayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsuka womthetho** (The source of the law).

Here's why:

The passage states that Muchanga said, “**Asikavumelani ngokuthi izothini imithetho yesiqalo nokuncishiswa kwamanani wezimpahla ezilethwa ezweni**” which translates to ""We have not yet agreed on what the rules of origin and reduction of tariffs on imported goods will be.""  This directly refers to needing agreement on the *legal basis* or source of those rules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukube iBenin ingajoyina i-AfCTA** (If Benin had joined AfCTA) - He actually announced Benin *had* joined.
*   **B: Ukusuku lapho kungaqalisa i-trading** (The date when trading would begin) - He mentioned the trading would start on July 1, 2020, but this wasn't what they were still *disagreeing* on.
*   **D: Izikhathi zokukhokha kwentela** (Tax payment times) - The text specifically mentions tariffs, not tax *times*.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani itrading ingaqala ngoJuly?","The correct answer is **B: Kunokuhleleka okuthile nemithetho kuhlanganise nenokuvumelana**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Asikavumelani ngokuthi izothini imithetho yesiqalo nokuncishiswa kwamanani wezimpahla ezilethwa ezweni, kodwa isimiso esinaso sanele ukuqala ukuhweba ngomhlaka-1 July, 2020"".  This directly translates to: ""We have not yet agreed on what the initial rules and the reduction of tariffs will be, but the system we have is sufficient to start trading on July 1, 2020.""

This means that *despite* not having everything perfectly finalized, there was enough agreement and framework in place to begin trading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage specifically says it's about Nigeria *planning* to join, not that they had joined and that's why trading could start.
*   **C:**  While Albert Muchanga announced Benin joining, the quote focuses on the agreement allowing trading to start.
*   **D:** The passage mentions rules and tariffs, but the key point is that there's *enough* in place, not that all the details of the tax agreement are settled.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i- Atlanta Journal-Constitution ithwesa bani kubaphathi yezefundo?","The correct answer is **C: Akwenziwe lutho ekuboneni izinkinga ezingaphakathi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Umbiko ukhombise ukuthi imiphumela yezivivinyo ikhuphuke ngokushesha, kanti futhi usola ukuthi lesi sikole sathole izinkinga ngaphakathi **kodwa asenzanga lutho ngalokhu okutholakele**.""  This directly accuses the school officials (including Hall) of failing to act on internal issues revealed by the test results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuphazamisa umbiko weJournal-Constitution** - The passage doesn't say the officials tried to disrupt the report, just that the report highlighted issues.
* **B: Ukuhluleka ukuthuthukisa imfundo endaweni zasedolobheni** - While the passage mentions improvement in test scores initially, the focus is on *how* those scores were achieved (through cheating), not a general failure to improve education.
* **D: Ukubika inani eliphansi ku-test** - The passage implies the opposite - the scores were artificially *inflated*.



"
"Ngokuya ngalokho okunikeziwe kulo musho, ukuphi okungaqinisekiswanga kumbiko weAtlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **C: Owinile ku-2013’s National Superintendent**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Hall won the National Superintendent of the Year award in 2009,** not 2013.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuthola inani elingalindelekile ku-test (Finding an unexpected amount on a test)** - The passage clearly states the test scores rose ""rapidly"" which indicates a finding of an unexpected result.
*   **B: Ubufakazi bokuthi amaphepha we-test aphazamisiwe (Evidence that test papers were tampered with)** - The report specifically alleges cheating on tests (""test answers were changed"").
*   **D: Imibono ngokuthuthukisa imfundo emadolobheni (Opinions on improving urban education)** - The passage mentions Hall was ""praised for his modern approach to urban education"" meaning opinions about it were mentioned.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okwaziwayo ngokuqhum kwebhomu?","The correct answer is **B: Yimaphi amabhilidi lapho kuqhume amabhomu khona**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states a bomb exploded *outside* the prime minister's office and three more exploded *near* government buildings. This directly answers where the bombs went off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isikhathi sokubala esise esisemqoka esibalulekile** - The passage mentions a timeframe (two hours) but doesn’t focus on calculating a specific time.
* **C: Ukube amabhomu angezelelwe ayaqunyiswa** - The passage doesn’t discuss whether more bombs might be found.
* **D: Inani labantu abashonile** - While the passage gives a confirmed death toll (eight), it also states the *final* number is unknown.  It doesn't definitively state the total number of deaths.



"
"Njengoba ajoyina i-Manchester City ngo2017, mingakhi imidlalo uJesus sekayidlalile?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Kusukela ngaleso sikhathi, umdlali waseBrazil wadlala **emidlalweni engu-53** emincintiswaneni yonke..."" 

The question asks how many matches Jesus has played *since joining* Manchester City, and the text directly provides that number."
Iliphiiqembu lebhola uJesus elafuna ukumnikela i-£27 million ngokulijoyina?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Palmeiras**.

The text states Jesus came from the Brazilian team Palmeiras for £27 million. Therefore, Palmeiras is the team that received the £27 million transfer fee."
Isiphi isitatimende okungelona iqiniso mayelana nesivakashi sasehostela?,"The correct answer is **D: Iningi lezivakashi babuya edolobheni elingcwele**.

Here's why:

The passage states the pilgrims were *visiting* Mecca, not *returning* to it. They were there the day before the Hajj pilgrimage, implying they were arriving for the pilgrimage, not coming back from a previous visit.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

*   **A: Izivakashi ziye eMecca ukuze bathathe uhambo olungcwele** - This is true, as they were there for the Hajj pilgrimage, a holy journey.
*   **B: Izivakashi ezinye bekungezona izakhamuzi zendawo** - The passage explicitly states many were citizens of the United Arab Emirates, meaning they weren’t local to Mecca.
*   **C: Izivakashi bezikhona ku-eve ye-hajj** - The passage says they were at the hostel ""on the day before the hajj pilgrimage.""



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso?","The correct answer is **C: Izivakashi bezikhona ku-eve ye-hajj olungcwele** (The guests were present on the eve of the holy hajj).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""Isakhiwo besihlalisa abahambeli ababezovakasha edolobheni elingcwele ngosuku olwandulela i-hajj pilgrimage."" which translates to ""The building housed pilgrims who were visiting the holy city the day before the hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akekho olimele** (No one was injured) - The passage states at least 15 people died, so people were definitely harmed.
*   **B: Zonke izivakashi babuya eUnited Arab Emirates** (All the guests came from the United Arab Emirates) - The passage states *most* of the guests were from the UAE, not all.
*   **D: Iningi lezivakashi bezizakhamuzi zaseMecca** (Most of the guests were citizens of Mecca) - The passage states the majority were from the UAE, not Mecca.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iluphi ulwazi mayelana nokushayisana okungaqondeki?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuthinteka kokushayisa komhlaba** (The impact of the collision on Earth).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Basazama ukuthola ukuthi kube kukhulu kangakanani ukugqubuzana nokuthi uMhlaba uzothinteka kanjani."" (Scientists are still trying to determine how large the explosion was and how Earth will be affected). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ubukhulu bokushayisana** (The size of the collision) - While the passage mentions they're *trying* to determine the size, it doesn't state the size itself.
*   **B: Indawo lapho kushayiswene khona** (The location of the collision) - The passage doesn't specify *where* the collision happened, only that it was 491 miles above Earth.
*   **D: Indawo lapho kusele izinsalela** (The location of the debris) - The passage doesn't mention anything about debris or where any remains might be.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, okuphi okusafanele kubhekwe ngaloku kushayisana?","The correct answer is **D: Isikali esiqondile sokushayisa** (The exact scale of the collision).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Scientists are still trying to determine how large the impact was and how Earth will be affected."" This directly indicates they are trying to find out *how big* the collision was – its scale.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ubani uzohola ekufuneni izinsalela** (Who will lead the search for debris) - The passage doesn't mention anything about a search for debris, only analysis of the event.
*   **B: Ama-Satellites ebegijima isivinini esingakanani ngesikhathi sokushayisana** (How fast were the satellites going at the time of the collision) - While the passage *mentions* the speed, it's not what scientists are still trying to determine.
*   **C: Umphulela kokuhlela kombiko kuzokwabelana** (How the report planning will be shared) - The passage states the results will be posted on a website, but doesn't mention the planning of the report.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi indawo lapho uBatten abambe khona ilisti yabantu abaseMelika abacebile?","The correct answer is **C: yesi-190**.

The passage explicitly states: ""UBatten walinganiswa ngokuthi usesikhundleni sama-190 ohlwini luka-2008 Lwabantu baseMelika Abacebe Kunabo Bonke abangu-400..."" (Batten was ranked 190th on the 2008 list of the 400 wealthiest Americans...)."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi uBatten wafaka umnikelo khona?,"The correct answer is **B: INyuvesi yaseVirginia**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Batten went to the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Virginia and was a prominent alumnus. This indicates a contribution *to* the university through his involvement and later success as an alumnus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhlu lwabantu abacebile baseMelika** - While he *appears* on the list, this isn't a place he made a contribution *to* – it's a recognition of his wealth.
*   **C: Inani lezindawo zokufundisa** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the number of teaching positions.
*   **D: Amakoloji azimisele ngobuciko nesayensi** - The passage doesn't mention any colleges or disciplines.



"
Ikuphi okungeyona isivumelwano esasyinwa uMongameli u Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukungasagunyazwa ukuthengisa noma ukuqashisa amavidyo game kubantwana abancani abangaphandle kweCalifornia**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses specifically on California law.** The law Arnold Schwarzenegger signed only applies *within* the state of California. It doesn't restrict sales to people outside of California.
* **A** describes exactly what the law *does* do.
* **B** is a consequence of breaking the law, not the law itself.
* **D** is the opposite of what the law does - it limits games with violence, it doesn't permit them.

Therefore, the option that is *not* part of the law Schwarzenegger signed is restricting sales to children *outside* of California."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani ongazwanga izinto ebezikhulunywa?","The correct answer is **C: uMiller**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lapho ecelwa ukuthi aphawule, u-Miller uthe, “U-Mike ukhuluma kakhulu phakathi nokuthethwa kwecala...bengizilungiselela ngakho angikuzwanga ayekusho.”"" This directly translates to ""When asked to comment, Miller said, 'Mike talks a lot during the trial...I was preparing so I didn't hear what he was saying.'"" 

Therefore, it's Miller who didn't hear what was being said."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso mayelana nokulalela icala lakaMiller?","The correct answer is **B: Ebengakalaleli njengoba bekasazilungisa**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states that Miller said he was ""preparing"" and therefore ""didn't hear what he [Duvall] was saying."" This means he wasn't actively listening during the relevant part of Duvall's testimony.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: UDuvall uveze umbono ngoMiller phakathi nokulala icala** - The passage doesn't state Duvall gave an opinion *during* the trial, only that he didn't hit Miller.
*   **C: Abantwana bakaDuvall bebekhuluma kakhulu njengoba icala beliqhubeka** - The passage mentions Duvall has two old children, but doesn't say they were talking during the case.
*   **D: Ebelalelisisa kahle indaba kaDuvall** - This is the opposite of what the passage states. Miller explicitly says he didn't hear Duvall.



"
Ubani oweza necebo lokuthi kumelwe kubuyekezwe i’Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **C: uJack Layton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""U-Layton ucele kube nezinguquko endleleni yokukhipha irisidi yesikweletu phakathi nomhlangano nama-PM, ecela kube “nokubhalwa kabusha okuphelele” kwendlela yokukhipha irisidi yesikweletu."" This means Jack Layton requested changes to the 'Clean Air Act' (implied through the ""credit receipt"" issue) and a complete rewrite of a part of it, effectively proposing a review.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uJohn Howard:** The text mentions John Howard in a completely separate context (regarding a hospital in Tasmania).
*   **B: Umcimbi wamasiko:** This option doesn't appear in the provided text.
*   **D: uStephen Harper:** Stephen Harper agreed to *send* the Act to committee for review, but he didn't *propose* the review itself – Layton did.



"
Ubani ongayithandanga i“Clean Air Act” ngoba ecabanga ukuthi isetshenjiswa ngaphambi kokuvota?,"The correct answer is **C: Umholi weNDP**.

Here's why:

The text states that Jack Layton, the NDP leader, met with the Prime Minister and requested a ""complete rewrite"" of the credit-claiming aspect of the ""Clean Air Act."" This implies he opposed the way the Act was being presented and likely believed it was politically motivated before an upcoming election.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhulumeni wesifunda ogunyaziwe (The authorized provincial government):** The text refers to concerns about interference in a hospital in Tasmania, which is a different issue than the Clean Air Act.
*   **B: Uqgoqngoshe (Minister):** The text doesn't mention a specific minister opposing the Act.
*   **D: I-Federal MP (Federal MP):** While MPs may have opinions, the text specifically highlights Layton (the NDP leader) as the one raising concerns about the Act."
ICompound cyanuric ne-melamine umazihlanganiswa nomchamo wekati kuphume ube yini umphumela?,"The correct answer is **C: Amakristalu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""abacwaningi bathole ukuthi amakristalu enzeka emchamweni wekati ngokunezeleka kwe-milamine kanye ne-cyanuric acid."" (Researchers found that crystals form in cat urine with the addition of melamine and cyanuric acid.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izinso (Kidneys):** While the crystals *block* kidney function, they *are not* what's formed by the combination of the compounds.
*   **B: ukudla kwezilwane ezifuywayo (Pet food):** The pet food *contained* the contaminants, but isn't the result of the chemical combination in the urine.
*   **D: i-Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR):** FTIR is a *method used to identify* the crystals, not the crystals themselves.



"
Abagcwaningi basebenzise i-infrared spectroscopy ukuze babone ini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwakheka okuyi-kristalu komcamo wekati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukwakheka kwalamakristalu kufana nalokho okutholakale emchamweni wezilwane ezifuywayo ezithintekile uma uqhathaniswa nge-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""  This directly indicates FTIR was used to compare the *crystal structure* in cat urine to that found in affected animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umsebenzi we-zinso** - The passage says the crystals *block* kidney function, but FTIR wasn't used to measure the function itself.
*   **C: Izilwane zasekhaya ezithintekile** - FTIR was used to *analyze* something from the cat, not identify the animals themselves.
*   **D: Ukudla kwezilwane ezifuwayo okonakele** - The food is mentioned as the source of the problem, but FTIR was used to analyze urine, not the food.



"
Ubani obhekisele kuLuna njenge “Queen of Extreme”?,"The correct answer is **D: uTommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""uTommy Dreamer wathi “uLuna bekuyiNdlovukazi Yokwedlulele yokuqala (Queen of Extreme).”"" 

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who referred to Luna as the “Queen of Extreme”."
Ubani obhekisele kuLuna njengo “freaky”?,"The correct answer is **B: uDustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin “Thulilwegolide” Runnels waphawula ngokuthi “uLuna wayehlanya njengami...”.  ""Ehlanya"" translates to ""freaky"" in this context. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abalandeli bakhe** - The text doesn't mention what the fans thought.
*   **C: Abaphenyi bakahulumeni** - They were looking for ""black boxes"" - nothing to do with Luna.
*   **D: uTommy Dreamer** - He used the term ""Ndlovukazi Yokwedlulele"" (Queen of Excess) and ""Owesifazane Onamandla"" (Powerful Woman) to describe Luna.



"
Ikuphi okungenzekanga kumshayeli obekasengozini yemoto?,"The correct answer is **C: Uthunyelwe esibhedlela isise Cambridge waya kulesi esise Great Yarmouth**.

Here's why:

The text states the driver was *first* taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth and *then* transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge. Option C reverses this order.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Ulimele ekhanda** - The text explicitly states the driver sustained serious head injuries.
*   **B: Akalimazanga abantu ebebasendlini** - The text says ""akekho kubo olimele"" (none of them were injured).
*   **D: Abezimo eziphuthumayo bamsizile bamukhipha emontweni** - The text says ""izisebenzi zezimo eziphuthumayo zikhulula umshayeli"" (emergency services freed the driver).



"
Yikuphi okungagqamanga ngendlela iNingizimu Afrika eyayidlala ngayo ngenkathi kungumdlalo webhola lombhoxo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukusebenzisana njengeqembu okuhle** (Good teamwork).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...nokusebenzisana njengeqembu okuhle kwabenza bavelela..."" (and their good teamwork made them stand out).  This highlights teamwork as a key element of their successful play.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ikhono lokuvimba** (Blocking skill) - While good defense is mentioned, the passage emphasizes the *organized* defense, not specifically blocking skill.
*   **C: Ukudlala okumangazayo ekuqaleni komqhudelwano** (Amazing play at the beginning of the competition) - The passage states they started well, but doesn't describe it as ""amazing,"" only ""easily"" (kalula).
*   **D: Isivikelo esihlelekile** (Organized defense) - This is mentioned, but teamwork is presented as a broader and more impactful factor in their success.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, umdlalo weNingizimu Afrika uqale nini ukuthuthuka?","The correct answer is **D: Njengoba umqhudelwano bewuqhubeka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""INingizimu Afrika nokho yaya ngokuya ithuthuka **njengoba umncintiswano uqhubeka**."" This directly translates to ""However, South Africa continued to improve **as the competition progressed**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngabo 10:00 ekuseni** - The game *started* at 10:00, but the passage doesn't say improvement began then.
*   **B: Ngokukoqinisa i-defense** - While strong defense was a feature of their game, it isn't identified as *when* their improvement began.
*   **C: Ngemva kokudliwa yi-Zambia** - South Africa *won* against Zambia, they didn't lose.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okunga vezi okuqondile ngomnotho waseChina?","The correct answer is **C: I-China ingaba neGDP enkulu kudlula i-United States**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""I-GDP yaseShayina ingaba nkulu kuneyaseMelika emashumini amabili eminyaka."" (The GDP of China will be larger than that of the United States in the next twenty years).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umnotho waseChina ukhule ngendlela emangazayo njengoba benza ushintsho** - While true, the passage *shows* this growth rather than directly *stating* it as a fact in this context. It's an inference, not a direct statement.
*   **B: I-China inemakethe enkulu yokuhambisa izimoto phesheya kune United States** - The passage says China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the US as the *largest market* for cars, but not that it has a larger export market than the US.
*   **D: I-China ayikaze yambisa izimoto phesheya ukudlula i-Germany** - The passage states the opposite: ""Ngonyaka odlule iShayina ithumele izimoto eziningi kwamanye amazwe kuneJalimane."" (Last year China exported more cars to other countries than Germany).



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i-GDP yeChina ingayidlula nini i-GDP yase United States?","The correct answer is **B: Phakathi neshumi leminyaka amabili**.

The passage states: ""I-GDP yaseShayina ingaba nkulu kuneyaseMelika emashumini amabili eminyaka."" This directly translates to ""China's GDP will be larger than that of the United States in the next two decades.""
"
U-Hu wanikeza kuphi ukwazisa kwamazwe asethuthukile?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuya ngale kwemithwalo yemfanelo yabo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""UHu ukhuthaze amazwe athuthukayo """"ukugwema indlela yakudala yokugcolisa kuqala bese uhlanza kamuva."""" Wanezela ukuthi “akumelwe, nokho, bacelwe bathathe ukuzibophezela okungaphezu kwesigaba sabo sentuthuko, imithwalo yemfanelo kanye namakhono.”"" 

This directly translates to him advising developing nations *not* to take on commitments beyond their development stage, capabilities, and burdens.  The other options are either related to China's actions or a general suggestion, but C specifically reflects the advice Hu gave to developing nations regarding limitations to commitments.



"
Yini engakhulunywanga ngoHu?,"The correct answer is **C: Usuku lapho ngethemba ukukhishwa kwekhabhoni azosuswa khona**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on air pollution reduction and a call for developing nations to avoid a ""pollute first, clean up later"" approach.** It *does* mention goals related to environmental improvement, but not a specific date for achieving carbon neutrality or zero emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isisekelo sokusikwa (The baseline for reductions)** - The passage *does* mention a baseline (""2005 level"").
*   **B: Iseluleko kumazwe asathuthuka ngendaba yokungcola (Advice to developing countries on pollution)** - Hu explicitly advised developing countries to avoid the ""pollute first, clean up later"" approach.
*   **D: Inani lokususwa kwamakhaboni (Amount of carbon removed)** - While the passage talks about reducing pollutants, it doesn't give a specific *amount* of carbon reduction achieved or targeted.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo uVeerman wathi isimo sakho sibi?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Angola**.

The text states: “I-Angola izobhekana nobhubhane olukhulu futhi isimo siqhubeka sisibi *e-Angola*,” usho. (Angola will face a huge epidemic and the situation continues to be bad *in Angola*,” he said.)

Therefore, Veerman said the situation is bad **in Angola**.



"
"Ngenxa yokushushiswa, ubani ozothatha isikhundla sekhabinethi sikaHuhne?","The correct answer is **A: uDavey**.

The text states: ""UHuhne ushiye phansi futhi uzothathelwa isikhundla kuyiKhabhinethi ngu- -Ed Davey oyiLungu lePhalamende."" This directly says Ed Davey will take Huhne's position in the Cabinet."
Makuphakama ushushiso ubani ozothatha indima yokuba u-Ungqongqoshe wezamaBhizinisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Imvu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""U-Norman Lamb oyiLungu lePhalamende kulindelwe ukuthi athathe umsebenzi kaNgqongqoshe weBhizinisi oyekwa uDavey."" 

Therefore, Norman Lamb is the one expected to take on the role of Minister of Business. The provided options do not have the correct name, however ""Imvu"" can be directly translated into ""Lamb"", therefore it is the correct answer.



"
Abadlali bakhuza isizalela ukuba zenzeni njesikhathi kuzodlala i-opera yeCamille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlanganyela ekusebenziseni i-cannabis**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the theatre encouraged the audience to *join in* (presumably in the cannabis use) as the performers smoked it on stage. This directly links to the action the players were prompting the audience to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuthatha uhambo oluya eJapan** - While the opera was inspired by Japan, there's no mention of encouraging a trip there.
* **C: Bajoyine e-stage njengoba bezodlala** - This is a general statement about performing, not specific to the unusual context of this opera.
* **D: Bavumele izimpilo zabo ziholwe yilokho abakuthandayo** -  This speaks to the opera's themes (love of drugs and Japan) but not what the players were asking the audience to *do*.



"
Ubani obhema instango ngesikhathi se-opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Abadlali**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""abaculi babhema insangu ye-cannabis esiteji"" (the artists smoked cannabis on stage).  ""Abaculi"" translates to ""artists"" or ""performers"" (in this context, likely the players/cast of the opera).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umculi** - This translates to ""the artist"" (singular) and doesn't reflect the plural action described in the text.
*   **B: Izethameli zesiFulentshi** - This means ""the French audience."" The passage says the theater *encouraged* the audience to join, but not that they were the ones smoking on stage.
*   **D: i-Camille Saint-Saens** - He was the composer, not someone performing or smoking on stage.



"
Iliphi elinye igama le- “spacewalk” lelo uLeonov alidlalile?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsebenzi owenziwa e-space**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""ukuhamba emkhathini"" (spacewalk) is also known as an ""umsebenzi wokuqala wangaphandle kwenqola-mkhathi"" (the first work outside the spacecraft) or ""umsebenzi owenziwa e-space"" (work done in space).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umsebenzi ka-Apollo-Soyuz** - This was a mission Leonov *participated* in, it wasn't another name for a spacewalk.
* **B: Umjaho we-space** - This refers to the competition between the US and USSR, not the act of a spacewalk itself.
* **D: U-Cosmonaut wesi-11** - This is Leonov's nickname, not another name for a spacewalk.



"
ULeonov wahola yiphi inxenye ye-Soviet yempi?,"The correct answer is **B: u-Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Ngemva kweminyaka eyishumi, wahola ingxenye yomkhankaso we-Apollo-Soyuz Soviet ebonisa ukuthi Umshudiliswano Wasemkhathini wase uphelile."" This directly indicates he led the Soviet side of the Apollo-Soyuz mission."
Ubani owalimala engozini?,"The correct answer is **A: uGibson**.

The text states: ""Ngemva kokuba kwenzeke ingozi, uGibson wayiswa esibhedlela kodwa washona ngokushesha ngemva kwalokho."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to hospital but died shortly afterwards.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umuntu osebenza egalaji** - The text says they *witnessed* the accident, but weren't injured.
* **C: Izingane** - The text says they were scared and crying, but doesn’t mention they were injured.
* **D: Umshayeli weloli** - The text explicitly states the truck driver was not injured: ""Umshayeli weloli, oneminyaka engu-64, akalimalanga ekunqubuzaneni."" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the collision.)



"
Kwenzekeni ngabantu ebebahilele engozini?,"The correct answer is **C: Bebememeza bekhala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Bekunezingane ezilinde ukuwela umgwaqo futhi zonke bezimemeza futhi zikhala."""" This directly describes what the children were doing.  The text doesn't mention any of the children being injured or dying; it only focuses on their emotional reaction to the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bobabili bashona** - The passage only mentions Gibson dying, not the children.
*   **B: Oyedwa walimala, oyedwa washona** - Again, only Gibson's death is mentioned.
*   **D: Bobabili balimele** - The passage doesn’t say the children were injured.



"
Abososayensi bebesenza kuhlelo elithi benethemba lokuqaphela okuyimbangela yaziphi izinto ezilandelayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Amandla adonsela phansi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the simulation was designed to mimic the gravitational pull (""amandla adonsayo"") between the dark matter halos of Sagittarius and the Milky Way, just like the moon pulls on Earth.  The scientists were hoping to observe how dark matter interacts *through gravity*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indaba ejwayelekile (Ordinary matter):** While galaxies contain ordinary matter, the passage focuses specifically on *dark matter* interactions.
*   **C: Izinxenye ezincani (Small parts):** The passage mentions dark matter is made of many small things, but that's a description of *what* it is, not *what* the scientists were trying to observe.
*   **D: Izinto ezimnyama ezikwazi ukubamba,ukukhipha ukukhanya (Dark objects that can trap, emit light):**  The passage describes dark matter as not interacting with light. The simulation aims to understand gravity not light interaction.



"
Ososayensi bebebheka kuphi okuthile kwe-zinto okulandelayo?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Sagittarius galaxy Nomthala weziNkayezi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the simulation was designed to mimic the interaction between the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy. The text describes the gravitational pull *between* these two galaxies, comparing it to the moon's pull on Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umthamo wezinkanyezi nenyanga (The mass of stars and the moon)** – While the moon is used as an analogy, the focus isn't on stars generally.
*   **B: Umhlaba neSagittarius galaxy (Earth and the Sagittarius galaxy)** – Earth isn't the primary focus of the simulation.
*   **C: Umhlaba nenyanga (Earth and the moon)** –  The Earth and moon are *used as an example* of gravitational pull, but the actual study is about the galaxies.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, ikuphi okungagxekwanga ama-Conservatives?","The correct answer is **A: Usizo lokusebenzisa imali**.

Here's why:

The passage states the debate was *about* spending a lot of money on aid and rebuilding. The conservatives (referred to as ""fat cats"") opposed this spending. The criticism of the rebuilding effort focused on *who* received contracts, not the spending itself.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuntula imizamo yokwakha kabusha** - The passage criticizes the *way* rebuilding contracts were awarded, not the lack of effort.
*   **C: Ubani onikezwa umklomelo wokwakha kwesivumelwano** - This *is* the main criticism mentioned – the contracts went to Washington insiders.
*   **D: Ukusebenzisa imali kwezokwakha** - The passage implies conservatives were against spending money on rebuilding.



"
Ubani oxeka ukukwakhiwa kabusha kwesivumelwano yemizamo yokusiza yeHurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Ama-Washington insiders**.

Here's why:

The passage states the criticism of the rebuilding efforts focused on awarding contracts to ""Washington insiders"". This means they are the ones being criticized for benefiting unfairly from the rebuilding process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukungavumelani nohulumeni mayelana nemali (Disagreement with the government about money):** While there was likely disagreement about funding, the passage specifically points to *who* benefited, not just the disagreement itself.
*   **B: Umsekeli wemithetho zomphakathi (Public policy advocate):** The passage doesn't mention advocates as the source of the criticism.
*   **C: Ihlathi (Forest):** The passage refers to the ""Orleans Forest Agreement"" but doesn’t state that the forest itself is doing the criticizing. The name is used dismissively by those opposed to the spending.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kunini lapho ukukhanya okubuya kuStardust spacecraft azobonakala khona?","The correct answer is **B: Inyakatho California**.

The passage states the light show will be visible to people in ""Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah"" around 5 AM Eastern Time. While it will be visible in all those places, Northern California is specifically mentioned first and is a direct answer to the question of *when* it will be seen (in terms of location).



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i-spacecraft izobeka liphi i-rekhordi kwezinto ezilandelayo?","The correct answer is **C: Ukubuyela emhlabeni ngokushesha** (Returning to Earth at the fastest speed).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""I-Stardust uzobeka irekhodi elisha elizohlala-njalo ngokuba indizamshini esheshayo ukubuya emhlabeni..."" which translates to ""Stardust will set a new permanent record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukukhanyise ububanzi besibhaka bhaka** (Illuminating the expanse of the sky) - While the spacecraft *will* create a light display, setting a record for *illumination* isn't mentioned.
*   **B: Ukubonakala emadholobheni athile** (Visibility in certain cities) - The passage mentions where it will be *seen*, but not a record for visibility.
*   **D: Ukuhamba ngokushesha okukhulu ukusuka eSan Francisco ukuya eLos Angeles** (Traveling the fastest from San Francisco to Los Angeles) - This is an example to illustrate its speed, but not the record itself. The record is for the fastest *return to Earth*.



"
uDr. Malar Balasubramanian uhlobana kanjani noSaroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Indodakazi**.

The text states: ""Lapho, bathola umzimba kaSaroja Balasubramanian, oneminyaka engu-53, wembozwe ngezingubo zokulala ezinindwe yigazi."" and then refers to Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, age 29. This indicates Saroja was the mother and Malar the daughter.
"
Umzimba kaSara Balasubramanian watholwa kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Eceleni komgwaqgo** (Beside the road).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lapho, bathola umzimba kaSaroja Balasubramanian, oneminyaka engu-53, wembozwe ngezingubo zokulala ezinindwe yigazi. **Umzimba ububonakala sengathi ubulapho izinsuku eziningi.**"" (There, they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, covered in pajamas stained with blood. **The body appeared to have been there for days.**) 

It also says he was found ""idolobha elicishe libe amamayela angu-15 enyakatho neSinsinathi elele phansi **eceleni komgwaqo**"" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eCincinnati** - While the location is near Cincinnati, the body wasn't *in* Cincinnati.
*   **C: Ebhuthini yemoto** - The body was found near the car, but not *in* the trunk.
*   **D: ePittsburgh** - The doctor worked in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio."
Yini eyatholwa ku-eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Skype**.

The passage states that the company (eBay) hopes to expand into areas where Skype is strong. This implies that eBay acquired Skype. Therefore, Skype is what was acquired *by* eBay."
I-eBay izama ukufeza ini ngalokho ekuzuzile?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukukhulisa ezindaweni ezintsha** (To grow into new areas).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the company hopes to ""expand its business and become beloved in areas where Skype is strong,"" and lists specific regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly relates to expanding into new markets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuhlanganisa imali engenayo** (To consolidate revenue) - While a profit is mentioned, the focus isn't on *consolidating* existing revenue, but using it for growth.
*   **C: Ukukhulisa iphrofayili yayo** (To grow its profile) - While expansion can *lead* to a bigger profile, the main goal stated is geographic business expansion.
*   **D: Ukujabulisa abaninimasheya** (To please shareholders) - The passage doesn't mention anything about pleasing shareholders.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani ongazange akhulumisane neziboshwa ezasala endaweni yokulwa?","The correct answer is **B: Amaqembu wokuhlenga umlilo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Abaxoxisanyao bazama ukulungisa isimo, kodwa izikhalazo zeziboshwa azicacile."" This means negotiators *did* attempt to communicate with the remaining prisoners.
* **The passage also states:** ""Izikhulu ezihlome ngempahla yokuzivikela kwababhikishayo zangena egcekeni zavimbezela iziboshwa ngesisi esikhipha unyembezi."" This indicates police officers interacted with the prisoners, though not through communication.
* **The passage doesn't mention** any interaction between the firefighters and the prisoners. They were focused on extinguishing the fire.
* **The passage doesn't mention** hospital staff interacting with the prisoners remaining at the scene.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwabangela ukuba iziboshwa zingasaqubeki nesiteleka?,"The correct answer is **B: Isisi esikhalisa izinyembezi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the injured prisoners were sent to the hospital, the remaining prisoners protested. Then, *immediately* after the guards entered the yard and deployed tear gas (""isisi esikhipha unyembezi""), the fire was set. This suggests the tear gas was the catalyst that escalated the situation and led to the fire, breaking any remaining attempt at a standoff.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuxoxisana okuphumelelayo (Successful negotiation):** The passage states negotiations were *attempted*, but not successful.
*   **C: Iziboshwa ezilimele (Injured prisoners):** While the injured prisoners prompted the initial protest, they didn't directly cause the escalation to a fire.
*   **D: Umlilo (The fire):** The fire was a *result* of the escalation, not the cause of it ending the standoff.



"
"Ngokombono ka-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, izwe i-Iran kumelwe izikhulule kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuzimel kuka-owela** (Dependence on oil).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umbusi ophakeme wezwe, u-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, uchaze ukuncika kuwoyela """"njengesicupho"""" esibe khona kusukela ngaphambi kokuvukela kwamaSulumane wase-Iran ngo-1979 futhi lokho izwe okumelwe lizikhulule kukho.""  This directly translates to Ayatollah Khamenei describing reliance on oil as a ""shackle"" that Iran needs to free itself from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imikhawulo yezimali** (Financial sanctions) - While the passage discusses financial sanctions, Khamenei's statement isn't *about* freeing Iran from sanctions, but from oil dependence.
*   **B: Umbuso wama-Islamic** (Islamic rule) - This isn't mentioned in connection to Khamenei's quote.
*   **C: Imali engena ngaphandle** (Incoming money) -  This is a consequence of oil dependence, not the dependence itself which is what Khamenei is addressing.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owavuma imiphumela yesixwayiso kumnotho yeIran?","The correct answer is **A: Imithombo ephezulu** (High-ranking sources).

The passage states: ""Ukuphawula, okwenzeka ngaleso sikhathi kuthelevishini, bekungokokuqala lapho **imithombo emikhulu yase-Iran** ivume ukuthi ukujezisa kunethonya elithile.""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: i-OPEC:** OPEC reported a *decrease* in oil exports, but didn't *admit* the sanctions had an effect. They simply stated a fact.
* **C: uAyatollah Ali Khamenei:** He talked about the need to become independent of oil, but didn't *admit* the sanctions were causing problems.
* **D: i-European Union:** The EU *imposed* sanctions, they didn't *admit* their effect (although the passage implies the sanctions *have* an effect).



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona indlela yokuvota kweFrance?,"The correct answer is **D: Amavoti abalwe abameli bamakhandidethi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that votes are counted by *volunteers* under close scrutiny, not by representatives of the candidates themselves.  The representatives are allowed to *observe* the process, but not to count the votes.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Amabhokisi okuvota abonkalayo (Transparent ballot boxes)** - The passage specifically states boxes must be transparent.
*   **B: Abameli abathunywe amakhandidethi (Representatives sent by candidates)** - The passage says candidates can send representatives to observe.
*   **C: Ukusayinela ukuvota (Signing a voting list)** - Voters sign a list after voting.



"
Abavotayo babonisa kuphi ukuthi bakhethe amakhandidethi?,"The correct answer is **B: Eshidini eliprinthiwe kakade**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""abavoti babeka **iphepha eliphrintiwe ekuqaleni elibonisa ukhetho lwabo** ngaphakathi kwemvilophi."" This means voters marked their choices on a pre-printed sheet of paper.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ohlini lokuvota** - The voting booth is where privacy is maintained, but not where the choice is *indicated*.
*   **C: Ku-imvilophu** - The envelope is just for secrecy, the choice isn't made directly on it.
*   **D: Emshinini phakathi kwe-booth** - The passage doesn't mention any machine."
Yini eyaholela u-Allen aqale ukufuna uMusashi iminyka eyisishagalombili?,"The correct answer is **D: Isithakazelo sakhe empini**.

The text explicitly states that Allen began searching for the Musashi after a ""lifelong interest in battles.""  While his wealth and investment in ocean exploration enabled the search, the *reason* he started it was his fascination with warfare.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, uAllen usebenzisa imali enengi kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlola ezolwandle (Ocean exploration)**.

The passage states: ""One of the richest people in the world, Allen reportedly poured a significant amount of his fortune into the exploration that took place underwater..."" This directly states he's spending a lot of money on ocean exploration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukubuyisela uMusashi (Recovering the Musashi):** While recovering the Musashi is the *result* of his spending, the passage says he spends the money on the exploration *to* find it.
* **C: Ukwakha i-ROV (Building the ROV):** The ROV is a *tool* used in the exploration, not where the bulk of the money is going.
* **D: Ukufunda nge-seabed mapping (Learning about seabed mapping):** Seabed mapping is a *technique* used during exploration, not the spending itself.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okwholela ekutheni isakhiwo sibe yingozi nangaphandle?","The correct answer is **A: Amafutha e-Uranium**.

Here's why:

The passage states officials *believe* the danger stems from the possibility that containers holding **uranium fuel** have exploded and are leaking. This is the root cause being investigated.  The other options are *results* of a potential leak of uranium fuel, but not the source of the hazard itself.

* **Radioactive caesium & Iodine** are detected, but they are evidence of a leak, not the initial problem.
* **White smoke** is a visible symptom, but not the cause of the danger.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona icebo lezokuphepha elinikezwe abantu bendawo mayelana nalokho okwenzeke esakhiweni?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubalekele ukuphefumula intuthu emhlophe**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states officials are advising residents to **stay indoors** to avoid the white smoke, which indicates it's dangerous to breathe.
*   Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

    *   **A: Balekela ukusebenzisa ama-air conditioning units** - The passage explicitly says to *turn off* air conditioners.
    *   **B: Hlala ngaphakathi** - This *is* a safety instruction given in the passage.
    *   **D: Balekela ukuphuza amanzi empompi** - The passage warns residents *not* to drink tap water.



"
"Ngokuya kuka Dr. Moll, yini okukhathazayo mayelana neXDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: Amathuba wokufa manengi** (High mortality rate).

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Moll said the new strain is ""very worrying and frightening because of its high kill rate."" This directly indicates his concern is about the severity and deadliness of XDR-TB.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Okuhlukile kwegciwane elisesibhedlela** (Different from the hospital strain) - While the passage mentions cases originating in the hospital, Dr. Moll's primary concern isn't *that* it's different, but *how deadly* it is.
*   **B: Igciwane elibalekela izidakamizwa** (Drug-resistant strain) - Although XDR-TB *is* drug-resistant (implied by the ""XDR"" designation), Dr. Moll doesn't specifically mention this as his primary worry in the provided text.
*   **C: Inengi labantu umuntu onegciwane angabathelela** (How many people one infected person can infect) - While the passage mentions infectivity, this isn't Dr. Moll's *main* concern; it's the high mortality rate.



"
Iziguli eziyingakhi ezithole leligciwane elisha kwaqinisekiswa ukuthi abasebenzi bezibhedlela?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""...okungenani ababili bekuyizisebenzi zempilo zasesibhedlela."" ( ""...at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital."")

Therefore, at least two patients who contracted the new strain were confirmed to be hospital staff.



"
I-NextGen isebenzisa luphi uhlelo lwezobuchwepheshe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ubuchwepheshe obusekelwe kwisathelayithi**.

The passage specifically states that NextGen uses ""technology based on satellites"" instead of older radar-based technology. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ubuchwepheshe bokunemba** - While NextGen *achieves* greater precision, this isn't the *type* of technology it uses.
* **C: Ubuchwepheshe obusekelwe kuGround-radar** - The passage explicitly contrasts NextGen *with* ground-radar technology.
* **D: Ubuchwephese bokukhishwa kwekhabhoni** - This refers to the *result* of NextGen (reduced carbon emissions), not the technology itself.



"
I-NextGen izuzisa kanjani ngokuqondile ukulawula umoya we-traffic?,"The correct answer is **A: Izindlela ezifishani zokundiza** (Shorter flight paths).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that NextGen will ""allow aircraft to fly shorter routes"". This is the *direct* benefit to air traffic control – they'll be managing planes on more efficient paths.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Izindawo zokundiza ezicacile** (Clear flight zones) – While NextGen improves accuracy, the passage doesn't focus on creating clearer zones, but on knowing *where* planes are within existing zones.
*   **C: Ukunciphisa bokukhishwa kwekhabhoni** (Reducing carbon emissions) – This is a *result* of NextGen, not a direct way it benefits air traffic control.
*   **D: Amafutha amancani** (Less fuel) –  Similar to C, this is a *consequence* of shorter routes, not a direct benefit to the controllers themselves.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini izazi-mlando ezingayigxekanga mayelana nalokho i-FBI egxile kikho?","The correct answer is **A: Ukunyusa izinga lokuphumelela**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the FBI was criticized for focusing on easy-to-solve cases *in order to increase the company's success rate*.  This means the historians wouldn't have criticized the *goal* of increasing success rates, but rather *how* the FBI went about achieving that goal (by focusing on minor crimes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukukhiph izinto ezidingekayo ukuze kugxazululwe izinkinga** - The passage doesn't mention anything about resource allocation.
*   **C: Ukugxila kakhulu mayelana namacala wokubukela izithombe ezincolile** - While the passage mentions child pornography cases, it says historians criticized the focus on *easy* cases, not specifically those cases themselves.
*   **D: Amacala wokwetshiwa kwezimoto** - The passage uses car thefts as an example of the *type* of easy case the FBI focused on, but the criticism wasn't specifically about those crimes.



"
Isinyathelo sokuziphatha okungadingekile kuphoqelele i-FBI ukuba yenzeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Sigxile ebugebengwini obugxazululeka lula** (Focused on easily solvable crimes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Abezomlando criticized the FBI for focusing on easy-to-solve cases, specifically car thefts, to inflate the agency's success rate. This is exactly what the undesirable behavior *forced* the FBI to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sithathe okudingekayo sikusebenzisele amacala wezimoto ezintshontshiwe** (Took what was needed and used it for stolen car cases) - This is a result of the shift in focus, not the forcing action.
*   **B: Ukuphula ukuphumelela kwama agency** (To undermine the agency's success) - The actions were intended to *appear* successful, not undermine it.
*   **D: Sinikela ngamaphoyisa ezindabeni zezithombe ezingcolile** (To assign officers to dirty picture matters) - While the passage mentions funding for this, it wasn't the direct consequence of the behavioral issue. It was a separate aspect of the scheme.



"
Kwenzekeni ngesicima mlilo esasabela engozini ye-JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Iginqikile**.

The text states: ""Abezindaba bendawo babika ukuthi imoto yomlilo yasesikhumulweni sezindiza yaginqikangenkathi iphuthuma."" which translates to ""Local media reported that the airport fire truck overturned while rushing to the scene."" 

Therefore, the fire truck *overturned* (iginqikile).



"
"Ukulandela ukushayisa kwe-JAS 39C Gripen, isiteshi sezindiza savela ngenxa?","The correct answer is **B: Izimoto zomlilo** (Fire trucks).

The text states: ""Umoto yomlilo yasesikhumulweni sezindiza yaginqikangenkathi iphuthuma."" which translates to ""The airport fire truck rushed in haste."" This indicates fire trucks were dispatched due to the incident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izindiza ezihamba endaweni** (Local planes) - The text says all flights were halted, not that planes were departing.
*   **C: Abezindaba basendaweni** (Local media) - They *reported* on the incident, but didn't respond *because* of it.
*   **D: Umholi wezendiza** (Flight leader) - The flight leader was identified as the pilot, not a response team."
UBrzezinsk wanikeza bani iziqondiso ngesikhathi kubusa i-Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: uCarter**.

The text states that Zbigniew Brzezinski served as National Security Advisor to *President Carter* from 1977 to 1981 and assisted him in dealing with events like the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uKissinger** - Brzezinski *replaced* Kissinger as NSA.
*   **B: uKennedy** - Brzezinski advised Kennedy in the 1960s, but the question is specifically about his role during the Iran situation.
*   **D: uJohnson** - Brzezinski advised Johnson in the 1960s, but the question is specifically about his role during the Iran situation."
Ubani obekasesikhundleni seNational Security Advisor kwaze kwaba ngo-1977?,"The correct answer is **B: uKissinger**.

The text states that Zbigniew Brzezinski ""took the position of Henry Kissinger"" as NSA. This means Kissinger held the position before Brzezinski."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi ngokuqondile umsebenzi kaBobek ngoPartizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **C: Wake wavotelwa njengomdali okubadlula bonke emlandweni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Ngo-1995 wavotelwa njengomdlali ohamba phambili kunabo bonke emlandweni wasePartizan."" (In 1995 he was voted the best player in the history of Partizan).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukore amagoli angaphezu kuka-468 njengoba bekasadlalela iqembu lakhe** - The text says he scored 403 goals *in* 468 games, not *more than* 468 goals.
* **B: Ukore amagoli amanengi ukuba dlula bonke** - While he scored a lot of goals, the passage specifically states he holds the record for *most* goals, not just ""many"".
* **D: Ukudlale imidlalo eminingi ukudlula abanye abadlali** -  The text says he played the *most* games, not just ""many"".  However, option C is a more direct and specific detail about his accomplishment.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende esiyiqiniso esikhuluma ngomlando kaBobek ne-Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuqale ukudlalela i-Partizan ngo-1945**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ubajoyine ngo-1945 futhi wahlala kwaze kwaba u-1958."" (He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says he was born in the capital of Croatia, but doesn’t mention playing for Zagreb.
*   **C:** The passage states he played until 1958, not 1995. 1995 is when he was *voted* the greatest player.
*   **D:** He gained fame *because* of his performance with Partizan, not after being voted the best. The fame came *before* the recognition.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izici ezihlukanisa iHesperonychus ku-Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Beyine zipho elikhulu lesibili**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Izipho layo lesibili belilikhudlwana, okwenza yabizwa ngokuthi yi-Hesperonychus okusho ukuthi “izipho lasentshonalanga.”"" This directly translates to ""Its second claw was blunter, which is why it was named Hesperonychus which means ""western claw."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inezinyawo ezimbili:** The text says it *likely* walked on two legs *like* Velociraptor, not that this is a differentiating feature.
*   **C: Umziba ogcwele izimpaphe:** The text states it was a fully feathered animal, but doesn't mention if that's different from a Velociraptor.
*   **D: Inegazi elifudumele:** This is a general characteristic of dinosaurs and isn't mentioned as a specific distinction in the text.



"
Isizathu esichaza i- “Hesperonychus” lithathelwa kusiphi isici salesi silwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Izinzipho(inzipho)**.

The text states: ""Izipho layo lesibili belilikhudlwana, okwenza yabizwa ngokuthi yi-Hesperonychus okusho ukuthi “izipho lasentshonalanga.”""  This directly links the name ""Hesperonychus"" to its claws."
Ikuphi okulandeyo okuyiniqiniso mayelana nokudubula?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukudubula kwenzeka eBuffalo**

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""…abe seziza e-Buffalo ukuzobungaza kanye nabangane nezihlobo."" and ""...kodwa umkakhe akalimalanga."" This clearly indicates the shooting happened in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: UMyeni nonkosikaze bobabili abaseTexas:** The text says they *got married* in Texas, but it doesn’t state they currently live there. They came *to* Buffalo.
*   **B: Bekuzezisulu ezinhlanu:** The text only mentions four people were killed, including the husband.
*   **C: Umbhnqana kwashada ngaphambi kweBuffalo:** The text states they married in Texas."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso mayelana nokuthi ukudutshulwa kwenzeke kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwenzeke emcimbini wokugubha isikhumbuzo eBuffalo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umcimbi wesikhumbuzo uhlelelwe usuku lwakamuva, kusho iziphathimandla... zabe seziza e-Buffalo ukuzobungaza..."" and then directly follows with ""...kodwa umkakhe akalimalanga"" (implying the shooting happened *at* the celebration).  This clearly indicates the shooting occurred at the anniversary celebration in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kwenzeke emcimbini ohlelekile wokugubha isikhumbuzo:** While the event was planned, the text focuses on it happening *during* the actual celebration.
*   **C: Kwenzeke emcimbini eTexas:** The couple *got married* in Texas, but the celebration where the shooting happened was in Buffalo.
*   **D: Kwenzeke emshadweni wabantu ababili abashadayo:** The shooting happened at an *anniversary* celebration, not the original wedding.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini into eyinhloko ebeyikhathaza izikhulu mayelana neLuno?","The correct answer is **A: Ukungabi nomanyolo emthwaleni (The possibility of the cargo shifting)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Initially, authorities were worried that the ship might **shift its regular cargo of coal**.""  This directly addresses what the authorities were concerned about regarding the Luno.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amagagasi nomoya ophezulu (High waves and strong winds)** - While the waves and winds were present, the passage says authorities were *specifically* worried about the cargo.
* **C: Ukuchitheka kopethiloli (Gasoline spillage)** - The passage mentions gasoline being used for something else (I-Luno ibinamamitha aphindwe kathathu kaphethiloli), but not that it was a concern about the Luno itself.
* **D: Ukulimala okungenzeka zenzeke ebantwini (Possible injury to people)** - While injuries *did* happen (a broken collarbone), this wasn't the initial concern of the authorities – it was the cargo.



"
"Ngokuya kwawlomusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okukhuluma ngemvelaphi yeLuno okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Umkhumbi bewune pethiloli okungaba ama-metre angu-100 ngesikhathi siphuka.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the ship was 100 meters long, not that it was carrying 100 meters of petrol.** It was carrying a normal cargo of coal.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Ukuphuka kwenzeke ngaphambi kokulandwa kwezimpahla:** The passage says the ship was *on its way to unload its regular cargo of coal*, implying the break happened before unloading.
*   **C: Phakathi kwabantu abayi shumi nambili, oyedwa owalimala:** The passage explicitly states ""the only injury was a broken collarbone"".
*   **D: Isikhephe saphushelwa ngasethekwini:** The passage states ""strong winds were pushing it into the water"".



"
Kungayiphi ikhulu lapho i-Algeria yaqa ukuzimela?,"The correct answer is **C: ngo-1960s**.

The text states Vautier returned to a *newly independent Algeria* in the 1960s to teach filmmaking. This directly indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.



"
Kukuphi lapho ama-sikirini we-thelevishini angaxunywanga emcimbini womgcwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kulolonke laseRoma** (Throughout Rome).

The passage states: ""Izikrini ezinkulu eziningana zethelevishini zifakiwe **ezindaweni ezihlukahlukene eRoma** ukwenzela ukuthi abantu babukele umcimbi."" (Large television screens were installed in **various locations in Rome** so that people could watch the event).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emadolobheni ahlukahlukene we-Italy** (In various cities of Italy) - The passage doesn’t mention screens being set up in other Italian cities, just in Rome.
*   **C: Ezindaweni ezihlukahlukene zase-Poland** (In various locations in Poland) - The passage states Poland *watched* the event via broadcasts, but doesn't say screens were set up there.
*   **D: e-St. Peter’s Square** (In St. Peter’s Square) - The passage specifically says the square was *too full* for everyone to fit inside. Screens were set up *around* Rome because of this.



"
Umcwabo bewubanjelwe kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: e-St. Peter’s Square**.

The text states that the funeral was held at St. Peter's Square, but it was so crowded that not everyone could fit inside. Screens were set up in *other* locations in Rome and around the world to accommodate the overflow. So while it was shown in various places, the *location* of the funeral was St. Peter's Square.
"
"Ukulandela ukuqhuma, obani owanakwa ngenxa yokulimala?","The correct answer is **A: Okungesanani abantu abahlanu** (At least five people).

The passage states: ""...okungenani abantu abahlanu abakade bese ndaweni yesigameko ngesikhathi sokuqhuma balashelwe izimpawu zokuthuka."" This directly translates to ""At least five people who were at the scene during the explosion were treated for shock.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Akekho noyedwa** - The passage explicitly states people were treated for shock.
* **C: Isikhulu sasenkampani ye-gas** - The passage doesn't mention if the gas company official was injured.
* **D: Umakhelwane** - The passage only states the neighbour *reported* the leak, not that they were injured.



"
Ubani obike ukuvuza kwe-gas?,"The correct answer is **A: Umakhelwane ngaphakathi komakhiwo** (A neighbor within the building).

The passage states: ""Lapho kufika izikhulu, ifulethi yaqhuma. Akukho ukulimala okutheni okubikiwe, kodwa okungenani abantu abahlanu abakade bese ndaweni yesigameko ngesikhathi sokuqhuma balashelwe izimpawu zokuthuka. Akukho muntu owayephakathi kwefulethi. Ngaleso sikhathi, zibalelwa cishe ku-100 izakhamuzi ezakhishwa endawe$ni."" which means “After the officers arrived, the apartment exploded. No injuries were reported, but at least five people who were in the area at the time of the explosion were treated for shock. No one was in the apartment. At that time, about 100 residents were evacuated from the area.”, and “Isiphathimandla senkapani yegesi saya endaweni yesigameko ngemva kokuba **umakhelwane ebike** ukuvuza kwegesi.” meaning ""The gas company official went to the scene after **a neighbor reported** a gas leak."""
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, bangakhi abantu abafa kulokhu kuhlaselwa?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage specifically states that Nicholas Alden, age 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, age 21, died in the attack. It mentions others were injured, but only those two are stated to have *died*."
Isikhali sakabani esahluleka ukusebenza ngesikhathi sokuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **B: u-Uka**.

The text states: ""Isikhali sika-Uka sahluleka lapho wayekhombe indoda yesihlanu ekhanda."" (Uka's weapon failed when he pointed it at the fifth man's head)."
Iwuphi umdlalo iyavotelwa ukuba ikhishwe ohlelweni lwe-Olympic?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Baseball**.

The text states: ""…and baseball and softball, which were voted off the Olympic program in 2005."" 

While the passage mentions squash and karate *attempted* to get in, it specifically says baseball and softball were *voted out*."
Iwuphi umdlalo owavotelwa yi-International Olympic Committee okumelwe ufake emidlalweni?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuhlangana kwe-rugby**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I-rugby, ngokukhethekhile inyunyoni ye-rugby, kanye negalufu zikhethiwe emidlalweni emihlanu eminye ukucatshangalwe ukuthi ihlanganyele kuma-Olimpiki."" This directly indicates rugby was voted on for potential inclusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Rollersports:** The passage says roller sports *tried* to get in, but doesn't say they were voted for.
*   **B: i-Baseball:** The passage states baseball was *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.
*   **D: i-Softball:**  Like baseball, softball was *removed* from the Olympics in 2005.



"
U-Arthur Guinness waqashisa i-St James’ Gate Brewery iminyaka emingakhi?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The passage states that 250 years after Arthur Guinness signed the lease, Guinness became a global business. The question asks how many years after he leased the brewery this happened."
I-Guinness iletha ama-bhiliyoni wama dollar amangakhi ngonyaka?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states that Guinness makes **10 billion euros** annually, which is equivalent to **$14.7 billion US dollars**.  The question asks for the figure in billions of *dollars*. While $14.7 billion is the dollar equivalent, the closest answer choice to the euro figure is 10.
"
Emazweni amangakhi lapho ase-European Union anegciwane i- H5N1 esebaboniwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Isikhombisa (Seven)**.

The text states that France is the seventh country in Europe to detect the virus, after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy. Therefore, seven countries have confirmed cases."
Kukhuphi lapho igciwane i- H5N1 esanda kutholwa khona?,"The correct answer is **A: i-France**.

The text states: ""i-H5N1, kuqinisekisiwe ukuthi luhlasele idada lasendle, elatholakala ngoMsombuluko, endaweni yamaxhaphozi eduze naseLyon empumalanga neFulansi."" (H5N1, has been confirmed to have infected a wild duck, found on Monday, in a mountainous area near Lyon in eastern France.)



"
Kunini lapho iGreece agcina khona ukuhlangabezana negciwane ngaphambi kokuthi lisakazeke abenzi bokuthula?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngezi khathi ze-1800s**.

The text states: ""Ngaphambi kokufika kwamabutho, iHaiti beyingakahlangabezani nezinkinga ezihlobene nesifo kusukela ngawo-1800."" This translates to ""Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not faced problems related to cholera since the 1800s.""



"
Ukungcola okwayiphi ndawo lapho kwasakazeka isifo?,"The correct answer is **A: Umfula i-Artibonite**.

The passage explicitly states that the cholera bacteria entered the Artibonite River, which is a major river in Haiti, due to improperly treated waste from the UN camp. This is how the disease spread.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ikamu lase-UN** - The camp was the *source* of the contamination, but the river is where it *spread*.
*   **C: Indawo lapho kwagadla khona ukuzamazama komhlaba 2010** - While the cholera outbreak happened after the earthquake, the earthquake location wasn't directly involved in the spread of the disease.
*   **D: Isikhungo Somthetho, Nokulunga Nenkululeko yaseHaiti** - This is a Haitian organization that cited research, it wasn't the location of disease spread.



"
Uhulumende wama-Irish uhlela ukwenzani?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukungezelela imithetho eqinile endabeni yezidakamizwa** (To add stricter laws regarding drugs).

Here's why:

The text states the Irish government is ""emphasizing the need to enact legislation urgently to rectify the situation."" They believe it's important for ""public health and the justice in criminality that the law plays a role as quickly as possible."" The Minister for Health also expressed concern about the impact of the temporary legal status of drugs and related arrests. This all points to a desire to *strengthen* the laws surrounding drugs, not loosen them, decriminalize them, or simply provide support (although support might be a consequence of new laws).



"
Yini okwakugunyaziwe isikhashana e-Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Izidakamizwa** (Drugs).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ukwenza umthetho wasephalamende ngokushesha ukulungisa isimo."" and ""...ngokumiswa ngokomthetho kwesikhashana kwezidakamizwa ezihilelekile..."". This clearly indicates that the temporary suspension related to drugs. 

The other options are not mentioned in the text.



"
Umsolwa uphenywa ngaziphi izizathu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukungena ngokungafanelwe (Trespassing)**.

The passage states the suspect is being investigated for ""weqa kunokuhuluza"" which translates to ""trespassing"" in English. The rest of the information about the fabric and altered letters is a description of *how* the trespassing was attempted - it doesn't change the *reason* for the investigation."
"Uma ushintsha uphawu, yini into umsolwa engayenzanga?","The correct answer is **C: Imoshe ngokoqobo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the marking wasn't real. It was *simulated* using tarpaulins. Therefore, the suspect did *not* etch (or otherwise permanently mark) anything in reality. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shintsha okukodwa emagameni:** The suspect altered the 'O' to look like an 'e'.
*   **B: Ihlobise ngopawu lokuthula:** The tarpaulins were decorated with peace signs and hearts.
*   **D: Sebenzisa i-tarpaulins ukuze uyithuthukise:** The tarpaulins were used to create the illusion.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo utisha wesingisi uKarno ongazange asolwe ngakho?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuthandana nomfundi**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Owayengumfundi wathi ‘wayesebenzisa isitsotsi ekilasini, afundise indlela yokuthandana ngezincwadi, futhi wayefana nomngane wabafundi’."" This means the former student said he taught them *how to love books*, not that he was romantically involved with a student.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as accusations against u-Karno:

*   **A: Ukuphula i-copyright (Copyright infringement):** ""Ubuye wasolwa ngokuphula amalungelo emithetho yokushicilela..."" (He was also accused of breaking copyright laws...)
*   **C: Ukunyathelisa izikangiso ngokungemthetho (Illegally printing advertisements):** ""Imfundo Yanamuhla imsole ngokuphrinta izikhangiso ezinkulu emabhasini ngaphandle kwemvume..."" (Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without permission...)
*   **D: Ukusebenzisa ulwimi olungahlanzekanga eklasini (Using foul language in class):** ""...futhi kubikwa ukuthi usebenzise inhlamba ekilasini."" (...and it was reported that he used bad language in class.)



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani ongathathwanga njenge sithunjwa uRolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **D: Abathwebuli bezithombe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abathwebuli bezithombe basePhilippines bakhululwe masinya..."" meaning they were *released* from being hostages. Therefore, they were never considered hostages by Rolando Mendoza.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izivakashi (Tourists):** The text clearly states the tourists *were* taken hostage.
*   **B: Amaphoyisa (Police):** While a police officer *caused* the hostage situation, the tourists were the primary victims.
*   **C: Abantwana (Children):** The text specifically says ""izingane...zikhululwe"" (children were released) *after* being held hostage.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iziphi izithunjwa ezingaqinisekiswanga ukuthi zidedelwe ngokushesha?","The correct answer is **A: Izivakashi ezihambayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izithunjwa ezimbalwa zikhululiwe futhi kuqinisekiswe ukuthi okungenani eziyisithupha zishonile kuze kube manje.""  Then it specifies that *six hostages, including children and the elderly*, were released along with the photographers. 

This means that the number of hostages released is not known, making ""izivakashi ezihambayo"" (tourists) the correct answer.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani othatha amaphepha asayiniwe okugunyaza umshado wobulili obufanayo eBrazil?","The correct answer is **B: uRoberto Jefferson**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The proposed law, after being amended, is now in the hands of Roberto Jefferson."" This means he currently possesses the document (the petition with signatures) related to the same-sex marriage legalization effort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ababhikishi (Protesters):** They are *collecting* the signatures, but don't *have* the petition once it's completed.
*   **C: Isonto lamaRoma Katolika (The Roman Catholic Church):** The passage states the Church is *opposed* to the law, not handling the petition.
*   **D: uMarta Suplicy (Marta Suplicy):** She originally proposed the law, but the amended version is now with Roberto Jefferson.



"
Ababhikishi bazonika izicelo zabo kubani?,"The correct answer is **C: i-National Congress of Brazil**.

Here's why:

The text states the protestors hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to present to the *President of Brazil* in November. The National Congress is the legislative branch and the President is part of the executive branch, so the petition would be submitted to the President.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isonto lamaRoma Katolika** - The Catholic Church is *opposed* to same-sex marriage, not the recipient of the petition.
*   **B: uRoberto Jefferson** - He's currently holding the revised bill, but isn't the final decision-maker.
*   **D: Imeya yaseSão Paulo** - The initial bill was introduced by a former mayor, but the current petition is going to the President.



"
"Ngokuya kuka Armand Versace, yini okwenzeka ngaphambi kokuba inengi lisabele kusimo sezulu?","The correct answer is **C: Bekunomoya osindayo**.

Here's why:

Armand Versace specifically states that ""the wind started to pick up"" five minutes into the show and then ""after a minute, the wind reached 70km/h."" This happened *before* the heavy rain, panic, and people being hurt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iqale ngesiqotho** - (""It started honestly"") - This is a vague statement and doesn't describe a specific event before the reaction to the weather.
*   **B: Lesi sibukiso besisemuva ngemizuzu emihlanu** - (""The show was behind by five minutes"") - This is a detail about the show’s timing, but not an event *before* people reacted to the weather.
*   **D: Ulahlekwele ilunga lomndeni** - (""He lost a family member"") - This happened *during* the chaos of the storm, not before it began.



"
"Ngokuya kuka Versace, umoya onamandla uqale nini?","The correct answer is **A: Ngemva kwemizuzu embalwa ngemva kwesibukiso siqale ukudlala**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Imizuzu emihlanu umbukiso uqalile umoya uqala ukungena, cishe ngemva komzuzu, umoya ufinyelela u-70km/h…"" (Five minutes after the show began, the wind started to blow in, after about a minute, the wind reached 70km/h...).  This directly indicates the wind started shortly after the show began.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngemva kwemvula** - The wind came *before* the rain.
*   **C: Ngemva kokulahlekelwa usisi wakhe** - The loss of his sister happened during the chaos, it didn't *cause* the wind.
*   **D: Ngaphambi kwesiqotho** - The wind came before the tornado (""isiqotho"")."
"Ngaphambi kukaFred, zingakhi izivunguvungu ezimandla ezibikiwe ezibuya empumalanga 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Kuthathu** (Three).

The passage states: ""...yiso sodwa kuphela isiphepho esikhulu sesithathu emlandweni empumalanga kwe-35°W.""  This translates to ""...it is only the third major hurricane in history east of 35°W."" Therefore, there have been three major hurricanes.



"
"Lapho uFred etholwa ukuthi usesiqhingini seCape Verde , beyihamba isondela ngakuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Entshonalanga**.

The text states: ""Isiphepho, esisendaweni ecishe ibe amamayela angu-645 (1040 km) **entshonalanga** yeziqhingi zaseCape Verde..."" 

This directly indicates that when discovered near Cape Verde, Fred was approaching from the west."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okugijima ngejubane elikhulu kunalaba abangaphambi kwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: i-802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ijubane lika-802.11n liphezulu kakhulu kunelangaphambili elaligcina ejubaneni elingu-600Mbit/s."" This directly indicates that 802.11n is faster than its predecessors.
"
Yini okudingekile nge 802.11n ukuze ibesemuva ihambisane ne802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Ama-radios womabili**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n can be compatible with older standards like 802.11b *if* the access point has *dual radios*. This is because 802.11b operates on the 2.4GHz band, while 802.11n can operate on both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz.  Having two radios allows the access point to simultaneously support devices using different standards on different frequencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ijubane eligijimayo (Maximum speed):** While 802.11n is faster, speed isn't the requirement for *compatibility*. It can slow down to communicate with older devices.
*   **B: Ikhono le 802.11b likwazi ukusebenza ku5.0Ghz (802.11b's ability to operate at 5.0Ghz):** 802.11b *cannot* operate on the 5.0GHz band. This is a false statement.
*   **C: Ukudluliswa kwenani le 600Mbit/s (Transmission of 600Mbit/s):** This is the *speed* of 802.11n, not what's needed for backward compatibility with 802.11b.



"
Bekuma event ayingakhi lapho indondo yegolide bekumelwe izobhukuda kumaCommonwealth Games?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubili**.

Here's why:

The text states the athlete ""was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m swimming competitions"". That's two events.  The other options are incorrect because the text only mentions these two competitions.



"
Kungani indondo beyingathathi imithi yakhe yama-pain?,"The correct answer is **D: Ayikavunyelwa kuma-Commonwealth Games**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Akakwazanga ukuthatha imithi edingekayo yokulwisana nobuhlungu bakhe njengoba ingavunyelwe eMidlalweni."" (He couldn't take the necessary medication for his pain as it wasn't allowed in the Games).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bekangezwa ubuhlungu** - The passage states he *had* pain, but this doesn't explain why he couldn't take medication.
*   **B: Beyimugulisa** - There's no mention of the medication making him feel sick.
*   **C: Bekakhathazeke ngokuthi ingalimaza ukuqina kwakhe** - The passage focuses on the medication being *banned*, not its potential side effects on performance.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini ebeyibanga ukudideka ngokuzamazama komhlaba?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuba khona kwamafu amnyama**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Amafu enze kwaba nokudideka kokuthi ukuqubuka kube khona yini."" (The clouds caused confusion as to whether an eruption had occurred). This directly links the dark clouds to the uncertainty about an earthquake/eruption.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ushintsho lwenzeke nini?","The correct answer is **C: Ngezi10 zikaMarch**.

The passage states: ""Ukuzamazama komhlaba okukhulu kuye kwaholela kwinguquko yesigaba esenzeka **mhlaka-10 kuNdasa** ohlangothini olusenyakatho-mpumalanga yesifunda sentaba-mlilo."" This directly translates to ""A large earthquake led to a phase change happening **on March 10th**...""
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungelona iqiniso nge-Chandrayaan-1’s lunar probe?,"The correct answer is **A: I-orbit yethule i-probe beyineqembu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the probe was *unmanned* (ingenamshayeli).**  An orbiting probe wouldn't have a crew.
*   **B: I-probe beyinezi qondiso ezibalulekile** - The passage says it carried three important scientific instruments, so this is true.
*   **C: Ukukhipha kwe-probe kuphumelele** - The passage states the probe landed successfully, meaning the deployment was successful.
*   **D: I-probe beyiphendiwe mahlangothi womabili** - The passage mentions the Indian flag was painted on all sides of the probe, confirming this statement.

Therefore, the only statement that isn't true based on the text is that the orbiting probe had a crew."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokuqondile i-lunar probe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukushayisa kwayo kube yimpumelelo** (Its landing was successful).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...yehlela ngamandla ngokuyimpumelelo eduze neningizimu yeNyanga"" which translates to ""...landed successfully near the south pole of the moon.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ifike eduze ne-nyakatho yenyanga** (It arrived near the north pole of the moon) - The passage states it landed near the *south* pole, not the north.
* **C: Ikhishwe inabantu phakathi i-orbiter** (It was ejected with people from the orbiter) - The passage says the orbiter was *unmanned* (ingenamshayeli).
* **D: Beyiphethe izinsimbi ezimbili ezibalulekile** (It carried two important instruments) - The passage says it carried *three* important scientific instruments.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iziphi izinyathelo okumelwe zithathwe ukuzivikela ngenxa yesifo?","The correct answer is **D: Amakhethini wemiyane** (Mosquito nets).

Here's why:

The passage states the government is ""distributing millions of mosquito nets"" as a response to the outbreak. This directly indicates mosquito nets are a preventative measure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amanzi abulala izinambuzane** (Insecticide spraying) - While the passage mentions insecticide spraying, it doesn't specifically state *you* should do it for personal protection.
*   **B: Ababambi bezingulube** (Pig catchers) - These are being deployed by the government to control the animal source of the disease, not as a measure for individuals to take.
*   **C: Imigomo yesifo sengqondo** (Mental illness prescriptions) - These are for preparation for future health organizations, not immediate prevention.



"
Isifo sidlulela kanjani ebantwini?,"The correct answer is **A: Imiyane**.

The passage states: ""Lesi sifo sitholakala ezingulubeni, esidlulela ebantwini ngominyane."" (This disease is found in pigs, spreading to humans through mosquitoes.)



"
Ukuhluleka komusho wesibili kungaholela kumuphi umphumela?,"The correct answer is **B: Amalungelo wakusasa wobulili obufanayo agunyazwa inyunyana yabantu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukwehluleka kwesigwebo sesibili, esifaka isiphakamiso ukwenqabeli umshado wokuhlalisana okusemthethweni kwabantu bobulili obufanayo, kungavulela umnyango ukuhlalisana okusemthethweni esikhathini esizayo.""  This directly means that failure of the second sentence opens the door to future legal recognition of same-sex marriage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukubuyekeza ngokushesha iHJR-3** - While HJR-3 *will* be reviewed, the passage states this happens in 2015/2016, not immediately. The failure of the sentence is what *leads* to the review, it isn't the result of the failure.
*   **C: Umthetho wezokuphuthuma wesikhathi** - The passage doesn't mention anything about time constraints on the law.
*   **D: Ukunqabela ubulili obufanayo kuma nyunyana wabantu** - The passage specifically says the failure of the sentence *prevents* denying rights to same-sex couples, not continues to deny them.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, umusho wesibili ususwe nini?","The correct answer is **C: Ngomsombuluko**.

The text states: ""Ushintsho lwenziwe kulengxenye yomthetho lapho imusho wesibili wasuswa okokuqala yi-House of Representatives futhi **wadluliswa ngendlela efanayo yi-Senate Monday**."" This clearly indicates the second clause was removed and passed by the Senate on Monday.



"
Yaphumela kubani ngokungemthetho i“Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkampani kaMossack Fonseca**.

Here's why:

The text states the ""Panama Papers"" are documents *from* the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. They were the source of the leak, and therefore the ones who were legally involved in having the papers originally. While others were implicated by the papers (like Deutsche Bank and Icelandic leaders), Mossack Fonseca *owned* the documents.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, bezindaba baseBritish bebathi ubani olawula umnotho wamakhampani njengoba ufihliwe?","The correct answer is **C: Ibhange laseDeutshce**.

The passage states: ""Iphephandaba laseBhrithani iThe Guardian lisikisele ukuthi iDeutsche Bank yayilawula cishe ingxenye yesithathu yezinkampani eziseceleni ezingu-1200 ezisetshenziselwe ukufeza lokhu."" (The British newspaper The Guardian suggested that Deutsche Bank controlled almost a third of the 1200 offshore companies used to achieve this.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amakhasimende amekahle ngokwezi mali wamabhange ahlukahlukene** - While the companies *were used by* wealthy clients, the passage doesn't say they controlled them.
*   **B: Ifemu lasePanama** - Mossack Fonseca created the companies, but didn't control the wealth itself.
*   **D: Uhulumeni waseParkistan** - The passage mentions leaders in Pakistan resigning *as a result* of the revelations, but doesn't say they controlled the companies."
Ikuphi okulandelayo izindiza ezibe nengozi okulimelee abantu kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Indiza iphahlazeke endleleni eza e-Armenia esuka e-Iran**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngenyanga edlule i-Iran yavelelwa inhlekelele enkulu yezindiza ngemva kweminyaka lapho indiza eyayiphokophele e-Armenia yaphahlazeka khona, yabulala abangu-168 ababekuyo."" This incident resulted in the most casualties (168 deaths), making it the most severe accident mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Indiza enophephela emhlane uyamaphoyisa iphahlazekile** - This accident killed 3 and injured 3, fewer than the Armenia crash.
*   **C: Indiza iphahlazeke endleleni eza e- esuka Irane esuka e-Iran** - This is a repetition of the location but does not specify which crash occurred.
*   **D: Ukuphahlazeka kwendiza eMashhad** - This accident killed 17, fewer than the Armenia crash.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona isizathu sokuba inengi lezingozi zendiza zenzeka e-Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Amaqembu anqabela ukuba kuthengwe izindiza ezintsha.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ukujeziswa kwamanye amazwe kusho ukuthi indiza entsha ayinakuthengwa."" This directly implies that sanctions (imposed by other countries) *prevent* Iran from buying new planes. Therefore, groups opposing the purchase of new planes isn't the *cause* of the problem, it's a *result* of the sanctions.
*   **A: Uquqaba lwezindiza zempi zakudala** - While the passage mentions old planes are used, it doesn't link the *quantity* of military planes to civilian accidents. It focuses on the age and poor maintenance of planes generally.
*   **B: Ukungabi nemali yokuvumela kuthengwe izindiza ezintsha** - The passage states sanctions are the problem not a lack of funds.
*   **D: Ukunakekelwa kwezindiza ngezinga eliphansi** - The passage directly states planes are ""not well maintained,"" which strongly suggests poor maintenance is a contributing factor.

The passage suggests the *root cause* of the problem is the inability to replace old planes due to sanctions, which is happening due to other countries punishing Iran, with some groups opposing the purchase of new planes being the reason.

"
Ikuphi okungabikwanga kureport okuvela kuIraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Umthetho enoshintsho, ubudlova obukhona e-Iraq bungaqedwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the report *warns* that no current approach will end the violence or instability in Iraq. This means the report *does not* believe a solution exists to completely end the violence, making option B what isn't reported.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukugxekwa kwemithetho yamanje** - The passage clearly states the report ""strongly criticizes almost all aspects of the current Iraqi regime.""
*   **C: Imvume yokuvelela imincele yase-Iraq** - The report calls for steps to secure Iraq's borders.
*   **D: Isicelo esenziwa i-US consesus** - The report opens with a call for ""open debate and consensus-building in America"" regarding Middle East policy.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okunganxuswanga i-Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukushitsha indlela ngokushesha** (Immediate change in strategy).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the report ""calls for an immediate change in strategy.""  While the report *mentions* the need for dialogue (C) and ultimately aims to reduce violence (A), the most direct and emphasized recommendation is a rapid shift in approach.  There's no mention of establishing new laws (D).



"
"Ngokuya ngamaphoyisa, ubani ebebamucabangela ukuthi bekamphathi wezinto zakaProvenzano?","The correct answer is **B: i-Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amaphoyisa athe uLo Piccolo uyaphumelela ngoba abe yisithenjwa sikaProvenzano ePalermo..."" (The police said Lo Piccolo was successful because he became Provenzano's trusted man in Palermo...). This directly identifies Lo Piccolo as someone considered to be a key figure and essentially a ""manager"" for Provenzano's operations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: uGiovanni Falcone** and **D: uPaolo Borsellino** – These were anti-Mafia judges *killed* by the Mafia, not associates of Provenzano.
*   **C: u-Ansa** – Ansa is the news agency reporting the information, not a person involved in the Mafia.



"
"Ngokuya nge-information enikeziwe lapha, kwakuyini imbangela yokufa kwakaFalcone?","The correct answer is **A: Wabulawa ngesikhathi sempi yakaRiina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...impi eyayiholwa uRiina ngokumelene nombuso owabulala amaMafia ayelwela inkolo uGiovanni Falcone kanye noPaolo Borsellino ngo-1992.” This directly links Falcone's death to the war led by Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wabulawa maphoyisa** - The passage doesn't mention police involvement in Falcone's death.
* **C: ULo Poccolo watshela ukuba ambulale** - Lo Piccolo is mentioned as benefiting from Provenzano's rise, but there's no link to him ordering Falcone's murder.
* **D: Wabulawa omunye wezigebengu obekasebenza naye uPaolo Borsellino** - While Borsellino was also killed, the passage doesn’t specify *who* killed Falcone. It just states they were both victims of Riina's war.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona imiklomelo kaHitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **D: Onolwazi njeJudo**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** Hitoshi Saito was an Olympic gold medalist *and* a world champion, *and* the chairman of a committee. He was very involved in Judo. Saying he simply ""had knowledge of Judo"" significantly understates his accomplishments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umpetha Womhlaba izikhathi ezimbili (Two-time World Champion)** - The text says he competed in World Championships.
*   **B: Usihlalo wekomidi wawonke kuhlanganise eJapan Judo Federation (Chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation)** - The text specifically states he was the chairman of the training committee.
*   **C: Othole indondo yegolide kabili yamaOlympic (Won two Olympic gold medals)** - The text says he won Olympic gold medals.



"
Kukuphi lapho uIwasaki ebalekela ukwenza izifungo?,"The correct answer is **B: eNepal**.

The passage states: ""wabalekela umshado e-Nepal"" which translates to ""he fled a wedding in Nepal""."
Ubani ohlasele uIwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Inja**.

The text states: ""wahlaselwa yinja enesifo sobuhlanya e-Tibet"" which translates to ""he was attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet"". Therefore, a dog attacked Iwasaki."
Umjaho uwumise nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva kokuthi uSchumacher aqede umdlalo wakhe**.

Here's why:

The passage states Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso. Since the passage is detailing events *during* the race, this suggests the race was effectively over for those drivers at that point. It doesn't state the race *ended* entirely, but for the people discussed, it did.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngemva kokuthi uSchumacher amoshe isindo langaphamili** - While Schumacher had a front suspension issue, this doesn't directly state the race finished.
*   **B: uFisichella uhlulekile ukulawula imoto** - Fisichella's issue happened early and doesn't signify the race's end.
*   **D: Ngaphambi kokuthi uhole** - This is irrelevant to when the race finished.



"
Yini ebangele uSchumacher aqede umdlalo kusese early?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukumosheka elingenzansi kwemoto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""UMichael Schumacher waqeda umjaho wakhe kungekudala ngemva kuka-Alonso, ngenxa yokulimala kwesimo esigcina imoto iphakeme emishikashikeni eminingi phakathi nomjaho."" This directly translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, due to damage to the system that keeps the car stable in many corners during the race."" This describes a failure of the car's underside.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akakwazanga ukulawula imoto** - While the damage *caused* a loss of control, it wasn't the direct reason he finished early. The damage is the root cause.
*   **B: Ukushayisana noAlonso** - The passage doesn't mention any collision between Schumacher and Alonso.
*   **C: Ukumosheka kwesondo okuyimbangela kaFisichella** - Fisichella's issue was different and didn’t affect Schumacher's race."
"Ngokuya walomusho, ubani okumelwe akhiphe ama-bail wabantu ababoshiwe?","The correct answer is **D: Ukhomishani was-court** (Magistrate).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ukhomishinali ubeka ibheyili, uma inikezwa, futhi wenza ukubekwa kwecala okwenziwe yiphoyisa elibophe isiboshwa kube ngokomthetho.""  This directly says the magistrate sets bail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umbophi wamaphoyiso (Police officer):**  The text says the police make the *arrest*, but the magistrate formalizes the charge and sets bail.
*   **B: uJudge Glynn (Judge Glynn):** While Judge Glynn issued a ruling about unlawful detention, they don't *routinely* set bail. The magistrate does.
*   **C: i-Central Booking facility (Central Booking facility):** The central booking facility *processes* people, but doesn't have the authority to set bail.



"
"Ngokuya kokubamba isigebengu okwesikhashaba,ikuphi ababoshiwe okumelwe babe nakho ukuze bavunyelwe bagedwe amahora angu24?","The correct answer is **A: Bail**.

Here's why:

The text states that the judge Glyn issued a ruling requiring the release of those held for more than 24 hours after arrest *unless* the magistrate set bail.  Bail is the mechanism that allows continued detention beyond 24 hours legally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuhlangana namaphoyisa abophayo (Meeting with arresting officers):** While important, simply meeting with the police doesn't justify detention beyond 24 hours.
* **C: Amacala aqondiwe akhishwe uJudge Glynn (Cases understood released by Judge Glynn):** Judge Glynn’s ruling *required* release after 24 hours *unless* bail was set, not that cases were released by him.
* **D: Ukuyolalela icala (To attend court):** Attending court happens *after* the initial detention period and bail decision.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isizathu esingachazwanga mayelana nokususwa kwe-runoff?","The correct answer is **A: Ubungozi bokuphepha (Security risks)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that authorities decided to cancel the runoff election ""to spare the Afghan people the cost and **security risks** of another election.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuphikisana komthetho (Legal challenges):** While the passage mentions legal ambiguity, it states advisors found enough ambiguity to decide a runoff *wasn't necessary*, not that it was illegal to cancel it.
*   **C: Izindleko eziphezulu (High costs):** This is mentioned alongside security risks, but isn't presented as the primary, unstated reason.
*   **D: Ukungaqondakali okukhona emthethweni (Existing legal ambiguity):** This explains *how* they justified the cancellation, not *why* they did it.



"
Kungani amanxusa agcizelela ukungabi nasidingo kwe-runoff?,"The correct answer is **C: Bekunokuphikisana phakathi emthethweni**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the advisors ""found enough ambiguity in the Afghanistan constitution to determine a runoff election was not required."" This means they believed the constitution was unclear enough to justify not holding the runoff, indicating a legal disagreement or ambiguity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihambe ngokumelene nomthetho:** The passage states the opposite of this - earlier reports indicated cancelling the runoff *would* be unconstitutional.
*   **B: Kube nezingozi zokuphepha:** While security risks were mentioned as a reason for considering cancelling the election, it wasn't the reason the advisors gave for deeming a runoff unnecessary.
*   **D: Ukhetho belubiza kakhulu:** Cost was a factor considered by authorities, but not the advisors' justification.



"
Ubani onikela iFATA isevisi yokwahlulela?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhulumeni wasePakistan**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Political Agents"" (Abaphatheli Bombusazwe) are tasked with providing government services *and* judicial functions *under* Pakistani law (specifically, Article 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan). This means they act on behalf of the Pakistani government in providing these services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Abasebenzi bezepolotiki** - While the Political Agents *are* political appointees, they aren't just providing political services, they are delivering government and judicial functions.
*   **C: Umungameli wasePakistani** - The President appoints the agents, but they don’t directly provide the services themselves. They act as representatives of the government.
*   **D: Uhulumeni wamaNgisi** - Pakistan gained independence from British rule in 1947, so the British government is no longer involved.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungelona iqiniso “Ngabasebenzi besePolotiki yeFATA?,"The correct answer is **C: Balandela ngokuqophelela umthetho wasePakistani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Political Agents operate *under* the Frontier Crimes Regulation (part of the Constitution), but doesn't imply they strictly adhere to all Pakistani law. The system is described as being *administered* by them, not necessarily governed by strict Pakistani legal code as applied elsewhere.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true, according to the passage:

*   **A: Banikeza isevisi yokwahlulela (They provide judicial service):** The passage explicitly states they adjudicate under FCR.
*   **B: Bakhethwe umongameli wasePakistani (They are appointed by the President of Pakistan):** The passage states the President appoints the Political Agents.
*   **D: Banokulawula okuphelele ezindaweni ezithile (They have complete control in certain areas):** The passage states they have ""almost complete control"" in FATA.

Therefore, option C is the only one that isn't directly supported by the information in the passage."
Yimuphi umklomelo uEmma akhethwe kuwo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umlingisikazi obadlula bonke**.

The text states: ""Ihansana kanye Netshe bakhethelwa ukuthola umklomelo Womdlali Nomdlalikazi Ohamba Phambili ngokulandelana."" This means Emma Stone (Netshe) is nominated for Best Actress.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umlingisikazi obadlula bonke ngokusekela** - This means Best Supporting Actress, and the text says she's nominated for Best Actress.
*   **B: Umqondisi obadlula bonke** - This means Best Director, and the text doesn't mention Emma Stone as a director.
*   **D: Ukuhlela kweFilimu okubadlula bonke** - This means Best Film Editing, and the text doesn't mention Emma Stone in this category."
Yimuphi umklomelo imuvi engakhethwanga kuyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ingoma Emnandi Eqanjiwe**.

Here's why:

The text states that the film was nominated for the ""umklomelo wengoma yangempela ehamba phambili"" (award for best original song) with *two* songs. This means it wasn't nominated for ""Ingoma Emnandi Eqanjiwe"" (Best Adapted Song).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isithombe esizidlula bonke (Best Picture):** The text explicitly says the film was nominated for Best Picture.
*   **B: Indlela Enhle Okuvezwa Ngayo Okubukwayo (Best Visual Effects):** While not directly mentioned by name, ""Umklamo Womkhiqizo"" (Production Design) and ""Ukuhlelwa Komsindo"" (Sound Editing) suggest consideration for visual aspects.
*   **C: Ukuhlanganiswa Komsindo Okuhle Kakhulu (Best Sound Mixing):** The text specifically mentions a nomination for “Ukuhlanganiswa Komsindo” (Sound Mixing).



"
Yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo ezaqhubeka zisebenza ngemva kokuzamazama komhlaba?,"The correct answer is **A: Yonke imishini esembonini eseHokuriku**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata **was operating normally** after the earthquake. This implies that industrial facilities in the Hokuriku region continued to function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isikhumulo sezindiza e-Ishikawa:** The passage specifically states that the Noto Airport in Ishikawa prefecture **was closed**.
*   **C: Bonke ojantshi abahamba izitimela:** The passage mentions that train services were **disrupted** in the affected areas.
*   **D: Imboni yamakhemikhali eseNiigata:** The passage does not mention the status of the chemical industry in Niigata.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo ezilimele ngenxa yokuzamazama komhlaba?","The correct answer is **C: Eminye imigwaqo**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Eminye imigwaqo ibe nomonakalo"" (Some roads were damaged).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amanye amakhaya** - While the text says 9400 homes are without water and 100 without electricity, it doesn't state that the homes themselves were *damaged*. They are lacking utilities.
*   **B: Imishini emibili kwezempi eShika** - This information is *not* mentioned in the provided text.
*   **D: Isikhumbulo Sezindiza EsiseNoto** - While the airport is closed, the text doesn't state it was *damaged*, just that it's ""savaliwe"" (closed).



"
"Ngokwendaba, iziphi izinkinga ezingafakwanga kuyidokhuyumenti?","The correct answer is **B: Imbangela yempi yango-1967**.

Here's why:

*   The document explicitly states it discusses the *borders* based on pre-1967 lines, the *future of Jerusalem*, *issues regarding the Jordan Valley*, and a disagreement about the *military presence in the valley*.
*   It **doesn't** mention the *cause of the 1967 war* itself - it only uses the war as a reference point for defining borders.

Therefore, the cause of the 1967 war is the issue *not* covered in the document."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungekho phakathi kwezinto ezifunwa yiPalestine?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuqhubeka nokuba khona kwezempi eSigodini SaseJordan**.

Here's why:

*   **The document states Palestine wants the borders based on the pre-1967 lines.** This aligns with option A.
*   **The document explicitly discusses the issue of the Jordan Valley and the disagreement over the military presence there.** Options C and D are related to this discussion. Palestine wants a *five-year* military presence, while Israel wants *ten years*.
*   **However, Palestine does *not* want a continued military presence indefinitely.** They are negotiating the *length* of the presence, not the principle of a continued presence. Therefore, the idea of a continued military presence is what Israel wants, not Palestine.



"
U-Ma wazifundela kuliphi izwe ezomthetho?,"The correct answer is **A: E-United States of America**.

The text states that Ma studied law at Harvard Law School, which is in the United States of America."
"Ngokwendaba, ukungenelwa kwaliphi izwe okwasiza u-Ma ekuphumeleleni kokhetho ?","The correct answer is **D: EChina**.

Here's why:

The text states that despite accusations, Ma ""succeeded in campaigning for closer ties with mainland China."" This indicates that cultivating a relationship with China helped him win the election. The other options are not mentioned as being helpful to his campaign."
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, uCarolyn Wilson wasebenzela ubani ngaphambi kokuhamba edolobheni?","The correct answer is **C: I-OHA**.

The text states: ""ujongene ngokuthi uCarolyn Wilson we-OHA webe imali yabo yesibambiso, futhi wabaleka edolobheni."" This directly indicates she worked for OHA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-East Bay Community Law Center** - The meeting was *held* at this center, but Carolyn Wilson didn't work there.
*   **B: Amaphoyisa Ase-Oakland** - The text mentions Oakland police investigating, but not that Wilson worked for them.
*   **D: I-Lockwood Gardens** - This is a location where people live, not an employer.



"
"Njengoba kusele imijaho emine kule nkathi, ubani osendaweni yesine kuyi-Drivers Championship?","The correct answer is **D: UBowyer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Okwesithathu, i-Hamlin isele emuva ngamaphuzu ayishumi nambili, kodwa amahlanu ngaphambi kuka-Bowyer."" This means Hamlin is 3rd and Bowyer is 5th. It also states Kahne is 5th and Truex Jr. is 6th.

Therefore, Bowyer is in fourth place.
"
"Umjaho olandelayo okukhulunywe ngawo kule ndaba, uKahne unamaphoyinti amangaki kuyiDrivers’ Championship?","The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The text states: ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. are fifth and sixth respectively with 2,220 and 2,207 points."" Therefore, Kahne has 2220 points and Truex Jr has 2207. The question asks about Kahne's points, which are 2220, so the correct answer is D: 2207.



However, there seems to be a contradiction in the text as it mentions 2220 for Kahne and 2207 for Truex Jr. but the question is asking for Kahne's points, which is 2220 according to the text.

Therefore the answer is **A: 2220**."
"Ngokwendaba, sekukangaki abantu bebona kuwa uhlobo oluthile lwetshe kamuva okwabonakala ukuthi imvelaphi yalo eyase-martian?","The correct answer is **A: Izikhathi eziyishumi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amadwala ayishumi nanhlanu kulawa kuthiwa enziwe amatshe awa emkhathini ngoJulayi odlule."" This translates to ""Fifteen of these stones are said to have been made stones falling from the sky last July."" Since the question asks about how many times people have *seen* a Martian stone fall, and the text specifically mentions 15 stones falling in July, the answer is fifteen.

However, the answer options do not include 15. The closest answer is ""izikhathi eziyishumi,"" which translates to ""ten times."" I believe there is an error in the question.

The question should be: 
Q: Ngokwendaba, kungaka kangaki amadwala avela eMars atholakale ngemuva kukaJulayi odlule?

The answer would then be 15."
"Njengoba kubonisiwe endabeni, yini eyiqiniso ngetshe elitholakale ukuthi imvelaphi yalo eyase-martian?","The correct answer is **D: Angu-34**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phakathi kwamatshe acishe abe ngu-24,000 awaziwayo awele eMhlabeni, cishe **angu-34** kuphela aqinisekiswe ukuthi avela e-Mars."" This directly answers the question of how many meteorites have been confirmed to be from Mars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wonke atholakala phakathi ne-July meteorite shower** - The passage says 15 of them were found during a July shower, not *all* of them.
*   **B: Angu-24,000** - This is the *total* number of meteorites found, not the number confirmed to be from Mars.
*   **C: Alinganiselwa ku-$11,000 ngaphezulu kwegolide** - This refers to the price of *some* Martian meteorites, but not a characteristic of *all* of them."
USchumacher wawuthatha nini umhlalaphansi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva kokungena esikhundleni sikaFelipe Massa**.

Here's why:

The text states that Schumacher *took the place* of Felipe Massa after Massa was injured. This directly answers the question of *when* he took the position. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngemva kokuba kushayise uFelipe Massa** - While Massa's accident *led* to Schumacher taking the place, it doesn't state when he actually *took* it.
*   **B: Ngemva kokunqoba indebe yakhe yesikhombisa** - He took the position *after* winning the championships, but the text specifies it was *because* Massa was injured.
*   **D: Ekupheleni kwemidlalo yango-2009** - The text says Massa would be out for the *entire* 2009 season, meaning Schumacher took the place earlier than the end of the season."
Walimala nini uMassa?,"The correct answer is **A: Phakathi neGrand Prix**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that Massa was injured ""after an incident during the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009."" A Grand Prix is a motor race, and thus the incident happened *during* a race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngemva kokuwina isicoco seFormula 1** - The text says Schumacher retired *after* winning championships, not Massa.
*   **C: Ngaphambi kokuthatha umhlalaphansi kukaSchumacher** - Schumacher took the position in 2006, Massa's injury was in 2009.
*   **D: Ngaphambi kwemidlalo yango-2009** - The text specifically says he was injured *during* a race in 2009.

"Ngokwendaba, amalungiselelo azoyithinta kanjani i-AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Inani labasebenzisa i-AOL lizoqhudelana nabasebenzisa i-Yahoo kanye neMicrosoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft will *exceed* AOL's customer base. This directly implies increased competition for users. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kungenzeka ande amanani abasebenzisa i-AOL** - While the passage suggests a decline in dominance, it doesn't directly mention price changes.
* **B: I-AOL izoyiphatha yodwa inkampani ethuthukisa ukukhangiswa kwe-IM** - The passage doesn't discuss AOL controlling IM development companies.
* **D: I-AOL angeke isasetshenziswa e-United States** - The passage states AOL is widely used *within* America, and doesn't suggest it will stop being used.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kuphele kulandela isivumelwano esisha?,"The correct answer is **C: Inkululeko ye-AOL yokuthuthukisa ezokudayisa ngendlela ethanda ngayo** (The AOL's growth in developing sales as it pleases).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""…growth is poised to end."" This directly implies that something related to AOL's growth will stop. The passage goes on to say that Yahoo! and Microsoft combined will have more users than AOL, meaning AOL's dominance is waning.
* **Option C** specifically refers to AOL's ability to grow its sales and development *as it wishes* – its freedom and potential for further expansion. The passage suggests this freedom/potential will be limited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuthuthukiswa okusabalele kwe-inthanethi e-United States** (Widespread development of the internet in the United States) - The passage doesn't suggest anything about overall internet development, only about the *market share* of different companies.
* **B: Ukusetshenziswa kwe-IM mayelana nokudayisa** (The use of IM in relation to sales) - The passage doesn't discuss the use of IM for sales specifically.
* **D: Ukubambisana kweYahoo kanye neMicrosoft** (Collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft) - While the passage mentions Yahoo and Microsoft joining forces, it doesn't suggest this collaboration is ending or in jeopardy.  It's the *result* of the change, not the thing that's ending.



"
Bangaki abantu ababulawa ngesikhathi kuhlaselwa ababengewona amaphoyisa?,"The correct answer is **C: 0**.

Here's why:

The text states that *two* police officers were killed. It also says that 19 of the injured were police officers. This means none of the fatalities were civilians. Therefore, zero people who weren't police officers were killed."
Ubani owabika owayesolwa kulokho kuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **A: Amaphoyisa** (Police).

The text states: ""Amaphoyisa athi asola osolwa ngokuba isosha leDaesh (ISIL) elinesikhundla ngenxa yalokhu kuhlasela."" This directly translates to ""Police say they suspect a member of Daesh (ISIL) is responsible for the attack."" Therefore, the police are the ones reporting the suspect."
"Ngenxa yesimo sendawo yaseFlorida sokuthi owinile uthatha konke, yimuphi umklomelo owanikezwa uMitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Zonke izithunywa zombuso**.

The text states, ""Njengoba owina lesi sifunda ethatha konke, iFlorida inklomelise uRomney ngazo zonke izihambeli zayo ezingu-50, emqhubekisele phambili njengenhloko kwabaqokiwe kuyi-Republican Party.""  This means Florida awarded all of its delegates (50) to Romney because of the ""winner-take-all"" system.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izithunywa zombuso ezingu-32:** The text states 50 delegates, not 32.
*   **B: Ukuqokwa eQenjini LeRepublic:** While winning in Florida helps Romney towards the nomination, it doesn't automatically *give* him the nomination.
*   **D: Amaphesenti angu-46 amavoti:** This refers to the percentage of votes he received, not the reward he received for winning the state.



"
"Ngokwendaba, uGingrich wathola amaphesenti amangaki amavoti okhethweni lokuqala?","The correct answer is **B: Amaphesenti angu-32**.

The passage states: ""Owayengumkhulumeli Wendlu i-Newt Gingrich e-U.S. ube ngowesibili ngamaphesenti angu-32."" This directly answers the question."
"Ngokwendaba, ubani ongazange aqhubeke nokufuna isikhundla ngemva kwemiphumela yamakhokhasi?","The correct answer is **B: UBachmann**.

The text states: ""UBachmann, owawina Ukuvota kwe-Ames Straw ngo-Agasti, wanquma ukuqeda umkhankaso."" This directly says she ended her campaign after the results.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: UGingrich** - He thanked Santorum and criticized Romney, indicating he continued campaigning.
*   **C: UPerry** - He initially considered ending his campaign, but then decided to continue.
*   **D: URomney** - He was the target of Gingrich's criticism, but the text doesn't say he stopped campaigning.



"
"Ngokwendaba, ubani owayikhulumela kahle imbangi ngemva kwemiphumela yamakhakhasi?","The correct answer is **B: UGingrich**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Gingrich thanked Santorum, but had harsh words for Romney, who was running a negative ad campaign in Iowa against Gingrich."" This directly indicates Gingrich spoke critically of a rival (Romney) after the caucus results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: UBachmann** - She *ended* her campaign, she didn't speak about rivals.
*   **C: URomney** - He was the *target* of Gingrich's criticism, not the one doing the speaking.
*   **D: UPerry** - He stated he was going to assess his position and whether to continue, not comment on others.



"
Iyiphi okwakuwukuphela kwendawo ebonisa indawo uhlelo olwalufakiwe kulo ngaphambi kuka-2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Umsakazo iTogiNet**.

The text states: ""Ngesikhathi lusaqala, lolu hlelo lwalufaka lodwa isikhathi eside emsakazweni we-inthanethi i-TogiNet..."" (When it started, the program was featured for a long time on the internet radio TogiNet...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I-East Texas** - This is where the *actors* were from, not where the show was broadcast.
* **C: Umsakazo i-AstroNet** - AstroNet Radio was created *after* 2015, so it wasn't where the show was originally broadcast.
* **D: Isiteshi somsakazo sendawo** - The text specifically names TogiNet, which is an internet radio station, not a general ""local radio station"".



"
Isiteshi sichaza uhlelo njengolunezinhlelo ezinjani?,"The correct answer is **C: I-Old school**.

The passage states the program is described as a ""old school radio drama with fresh tech info!"".  ""Old school"" directly translates to ""udla ngoludala"" in the original Zulu text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amafunda** - This doesn't relate to the description of the program.
*   **B: IGeeky** - While it mentions ""fresh tech info"", the primary description isn't ""geeky"" overall.
*   **D: Okwendawo** -  While the initial cast *were* local, this doesn't define the program's *style* as described by the station."
Yini lena uDavid Headley ayihlanganisa eyasiza kakhulu ukuhlasela kweqembu lezidlamlilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ulwazi** (Information).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ukuhlola nokuqongelela ukwaziswa kukaDavid Headley kwasiza ekuvumeleni umsebenzi wamasosha anezibhamu angu-10..."" This translates to ""The investigation and collection of information from David Headley helped in coordinating the operation of 10 gunmen..."" 

This clearly indicates that Headley provided **information** that was crucial to the attack's planning and execution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amabhomu aphonswayo** (Explosive bombs) - While bombs were *used* in the attack, Headley didn't provide them.
*   **C: Abaphatha izibhamu** (Gunmen) - Headley didn't *participate* as one of the gunmen; he provided information *about* them.
*   **D: Izikhali ezizishintshayo** (Assault weapons) - Similar to the bombs, these were used but not provided by Headley."
Yiluphi uhlobo lwezokuthutha olwasetshenziswa yiqembu lezidlamlilo lapho zibheke eMumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Isikembe**.

The passage states: ""Abahlaseli baseMumbai bafika **ngesikebhe** ngoNovemba 26, 2008..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived **by boat** on November 26, 2008..."""
Yisiphi isitatimende eziwuveza kahle imiphumela womidlalo kaNadal kanye noRaonic kwiBrisbane Open obalulwe kule ndaba?,"The correct answer is **A: URaonic ubhaxabule uNadal**.

The passage states: ""Usanda kwehluleka muva nje ebhekene no-Raonic eBrisbane Open."" This means Nadal lost to Raonic in the Brisbane Open. ""Kwehluleka"" translates to ""failed"" or ""lost"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: URaonic ube namaphuzu angamaphesenti angu-88** - The passage says Nadal had 88% points, not Raonic.
*   **C: UNadal ubhaxabule uRaonic** - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
*   **D: URaonic ufake amaphuzu angu-76** - The passage says Nadal won 76 points, not Raonic.



"
"Ngokwendaba, umdlalo kaNadal noRaonic wawukusiphi isigaba ngemva kokuqalwa komdlalo?","The correct answer is **C: Imiphumela yaba ngu-7-2**.

The passage states: ""Umlando wokuncintisana phakathi kukaNadal nomuntu waseKhanada u-7–2."" This directly tells us the result of the match was 7-2.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: URaonic ube namaphuzu angamaphesenti angu-88** - The passage says Nadal had 88% of points on his serve, not Raonic.
*   **B: UNadal wawina ngamaphuzu angu-76** - The passage mentions 76 *total* points won by Nadal, not just the number of points he won with.
*   **D: URaonic ubhaxabule uNadal** - The passage states Nadal won 7-2, meaning he *defeated* Raonic, not the other way around.



"
Yiluphi uhlelo lolimi olungafakiwe emsakazweni emithathu emisha yeNaked News?,"The correct answer is **D: IsiPenishi**.

Here's why:

The text states Naked News already reports in English and Japanese, and is *adding* programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Spanish (IsiPenishi) is the only language listed that is one of the new programs.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi lapho ingeke itholakale khona iNaked News?","The correct answer is **A: Kwiselula** (In Zulu, ""iselula"" means mobile device).

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News is expanding to include programs for television, the internet, *and mobile devices*. It doesn't mention a lack of availability on those platforms, but implies they *will* be available in the new languages. The question asks where it *won't* be found. Therefore, the only logical answer is that it won't be available on ""iselula"" (mobile devices) at the moment, but will be in the future after the expansion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku-Inthanethi (On the Internet):** The passage specifically says they're expanding *to* the internet in these new languages.
*   **C: Endaweni yokubuka amamuvi (In a movie theater):** The passage makes no mention of movie theaters.
*   **D: Ku-Tv (On TV):** The passage specifically says they're expanding *to* TV in these new languages.

Zingaki izimbangi ezingazange ziyiqede iGiant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **C: 4**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abashushuluza eqhweni abane eqenjini labesifazane abahlezi bahluleke ukuqeda imijaho yabo..."" This directly refers to the number of competitors who did not finish the Giant Slalom race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 36** - This number refers to the competitors who did not finish the first Slalom race.
*   **B: 117** - This is the total number of competitors in the Giant Slalom.
*   **D: 45** - This number refers to the number of competitors who did not get a ranking in the Giant Slalom, which is different from not finishing.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esiyiveza kahle imiphumela yomjaho weChampionships?,"The correct answer is **C: Abatshuzi abaningi bayiqeda iGiant Slalom kuneSlalom**.

Here's why:

*   **Slalom:** 36 out of 116 finishers (meaning 116 - 36 = 80 did *not* finish).
*   **Giant Slalom:** 117 total starters - 4 (didn't finish) = 113 finishers.

Therefore, more skiers finished the Giant Slalom (113) than the Slalom (36).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text states Carpanedo was *behind* the Hungarian skier, Gyöngyi Dani.
*   **B:** The text states 45 skiers didn't finish the *Giant Slalom*.
*   **D:** Carpanedo did not finish the Slalom competition at all, so could not have placed tenth.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo iNBA eyakhetha ukukuyeka?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkathi ye-basketball**.

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA ""suspended *all* basketball games for the season.""  This means they stopped the entire basketball *season* (inkathi ye-basketball).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umdlali ovela kwi-Utah Jazz** - While a player from the Utah Jazz *triggered* the decision, the NBA didn't stop just that player.
* **C: Yinoma yimuphi umdlali owatholakala ene-COVID-19** - This is too narrow. The NBA reacted to the potential spread, not just the single positive test.
* **D: Iqembu le-basketball i-Utah Jazz** -  The NBA didn't stop just the Utah Jazz team; they stopped all teams.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyaholela ekukhathazekeni kweNBA ngokuphathelene negciwane?","The correct answer is **D: Umdlali we-Utah Jazz watholakala enegciwane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Isinqumo se-NBA silandele lapho umdlali we-Utah Jazz etholakale ukuthi unegciwane le-COVID-19."" (The NBA's decision followed when a Utah Jazz player was found to have COVID-19).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage only mentions *one* player being found with the virus.
*   **B:** It doesn't state that *multiple* players were found with the virus *in a game*.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention the player's performance; it focuses on the positive test result.

Ubani owafaka igoli lokuwina kwiWashington Capitals emdlalweni wayo ne-Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: UNicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Ovechkin’s first assist of the night was a game-winning goal by rookie Nicklas Backstrom"". This directly answers the question."
Ubani owafaka igoli lesi-60 emdlalweni owawuphakathi kweCapitals neThrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: U-Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""Igoli lakhe lobusuku bekungelama-60 lesizini, eba ngumdlali wokuqala wokushaya amagoli angu-60 noma ngaphezulu ngesizini kusukela ngo-1995-96...""  This clearly indicates Ovechkin scored his 60th goal in the game.

Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr are mentioned as having achieved the same feat in a previous season, but not in this specific game. Nicklas Backstrom assisted on a goal, but did not score it."
Ibhange laseNorthern Rock lakudinga nini ukusekelwa uhulumeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Phakathi nenkinga yokubanjiswa kwempahla ukuze kukhokhwe isikweletu** (During the subprime mortgage crisis).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Northern Rock *requested* support because of its exposure during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007."" This directly links the need for support to the financial crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the bank *eventually* became nationalized, it *requested* support *before* that happened.
*   **B:** The split happened *after* the bank was already nationalized and in need of support.
*   **C:** Virgin acquired part of Northern Rock *after* it was nationalized, not before the need for support arose."
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esikuchaza ngokunembile ukusebenzelana kweVirgin Group kanye nebhange iNorthern Rock?","The correct answer is **D: IVirgin Group yenza ibhidi yokuqala yebhange ngemva kokuba ibhange lisetshenziswe yizwe**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Virgin Group kaMnumzane - Richard Branson yayinebhidi yebhange eyanqatshelwa ngaphambili kokuba leli bhange libe elezwe."" (Virgin Group made a bid for the bank *before* it was nationalized). Later it mentions ""Ngo-2010, nakuba lenziwe elezwe, ibhange eliphezulu lamanje i-Northern Rock plc lahlukaniswa ‘ebhange elibi‘… I-Virgin ithenge ‘ibhange elihle’ lase-Roch eseNyakatho kuphela…"" (After nationalization, Virgin bought the ""good bank"" part.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text explicitly states Virgin *did not* buy the asset management company (""hhayi inkampani yokuphatha impahla"").
*   **B:**  Virgin made a bid *before* nationalization, not after.
*   **C:** The text says the UK government provided the emergency assistance, not Virgin Group.

"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, yiliphi izwe elathintwa ukusayinwa kweKyoto mayelana nesimo sezulu?","The correct answer is **C: E-Australia**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The Australian government has long resisted allowing Kyoto, saying it would harm the economy due to its heavy reliance on exporting coal to other countries."" 

While the passage mentions the US not signing and criticizes the lack of obligations for India and China, it *specifically details* Australia's resistance and the reasons behind it. Therefore, Australia is the country most directly discussed as being affected by the Kyoto Protocol in this excerpt.



"
Uhulumeni wangaphambili wase-Australia ucabanga ukuthi ukuqinisekiswa kwe-Kyoto kuzobangela ukulimala kwani?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwezomnotho kwezwe** (To the country's economy).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Australian government ""wenqabe ukuvumela iKyoto, uthi izolimaza umnotho"" which translates to ""refused to allow Kyoto, saying it would damage the economy."" This directly links the government's refusal to Kyoto with concerns about economic harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwe-United States** (To the United States) - The passage mentions the US not signing, but doesn't state Australia's refusal is *because* of the US.
*   **C: Ukuthunyelwa kwamalahle** (Exports) - While the passage mentions Australia's reliance on exports, the *reason* given for refusing Kyoto is economic damage, not simply exports.
*   **D: Imigomo yokukhishwa kwezwe** (The country's emission targets) - The passage suggests Australia felt unfairly targeted but the main argument is about economic impact.



"
Yiluphi uhlelo olwalungelokudubula olwaqokelwa lona?,"The correct answer is **D: Uhlelo lokuzingela lweSporting Shooters Association**.

The text explicitly states: ""...amavolontiya afanelekayo abuthwa, **ngaphansi kohlelo lokuzingela lweSporting Shooters Association**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhlelo lweSporting Shooters Association lwase-Australia** - This is too broad. It's the *hunting program* within the association that was used.
*   **B: Uhlelo lweLokulondwa KwePaki NamaFa** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Uhlelo lweNPWS** - While the NPWS collaborated, they didn't *provide* the shooting program.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende ezingabonisi ukunemba kokuhlola kwendlela yokubulala izinambuzane?,"The correct answer is **A: Njengoba kwakuwukuhlola kokuqala kohlelo, akuzange kuhlolisiswe** (As it was the first test of the program, it was not evaluated).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the program's success *was* evaluated.** It says ""...isilingo besiqashelwe futhi impumelelo yaso ihlolwa"" (the program was monitored and its success evaluated).  Option A directly contradicts this.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **B: Abadubuli bathola iziqondiso zokuqeqesha** (The shooters received training instructions) - The passage confirms this: ""...abadubuli abane abakhethwe ohlelweni lokudubula bathola ukuqeqeshwa okujulile kokuphepha nokuqeqesha"" (four shooters selected for the shooting program received thorough safety and training).
* **C: Abadubuli babegadwe umuntu oqaphile** (The shooters were supervised by an observer) - The passage states ""bekufanele babekwe iso abaphathi bendawo"" (local managers were supposed to be monitoring).
* **D: Kwakhetha abadubuli abane** (Four shooters were selected) - The passage explicitly states ""...abadubuli abane abakhethwe ohlelweni lokudubula"" (four shooters were selected for the shooting program).



"
"Ngokwendaba, kwatholakala kuphi ukwehlukana?","The correct answer is **D: E-Ethopia**.

Here's why:

The passage states Berhane Asfaw is a researcher at the Rift Valley Research Service *in Ethiopia*. The discovery of the split is connected to his work there. While the Rift Valley is mentioned, Ethiopia is the specific location of the research and therefore the discovery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: EsiGodini saseRift** - While the research is *in* the Rift Valley, the passage doesn't say the split was *found in* the valley itself, but rather connected to work done there.
*   **B: Ezinsaleleni zamathambo** - The passage doesn't directly mention bones or fossils as the location of the split's discovery.
*   **C: Ebufakazini bamangqamuzana** - The passage states the split is *older than what the fossil evidence suggested* - it wasn't found *in* the fossil evidence.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyenzeka ngokushesha kunangesikhathi esilindelekile?","The correct answer is **B: Ukwehlukana (Separation/Divergence)**.

Here's why:

The quote states: ""...this means the split was much earlier than suggested by the fossil evidence.""  This directly refers to a *separation* or *divergence* happening earlier than previously thought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukutholakala kwamathambo (Discovery of fossils):** While fossils are *related* to the research, the quote isn't about a new discovery happening.
*   **C: Ukuhlolwa kwamangqamuzana awubufakazi (Examination of fossil evidence):** The quote says the separation is *earlier than* what the fossil evidence *suggested*, not that the evidence itself is the immediate event.
*   **D: Ucwaningo lwasesiGodini saseRift (Rift Valley Research):** This refers to where the research is taking place, not what is happening in terms of timeline.



"
Yini umdlali azodinga ukuyenza ukuze asebenzise ngezandla umdlalo wevidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Hambisa into oqondisa ngayo emoyeni**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller ""will allow players to control actions and movement in the video game by **moving the device through the air**."" This directly answers the question of how a player will interact with the game using the controller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuqinisekisa ukuthi into yokuqondisa iseduze nesigubhu somshini wokudlala** - The passage mentions sensors being positioned *towards* the TV, not the console itself.
*   **B: Ukuhlukanisa indlela izinto ezime ngayo** - This doesn't relate to how the controller is used.
*   **C: Ukubeka umshini eduze kweTv** - While proximity to the TV is mentioned for the sensors, it isn't what the player *does* to control the game."
Yini eyenziwa yabukeka njengethuluzi lokusebenzisa iTv?,"The correct answer is **B: Umshini wokuqondisa iNintendo Revolution**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isilawuli esifana ne-remote yethelevishini, sisebenzisa izinzwa ezimbili..."" (The controller, *like a television remote*, uses two sensors...).  The passage is describing the *controller* for the Nintendo Revolution, and it's being likened to a TV remote. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umshini emibili yokuqondisa** (Two-machine direction):  The passage only mentions two *sensors*, not two machines.
* **C: Ukwethulwa kombukiso oyinhloko** (Main show introduction): This refers to the Tokyo Game Show, not the controller itself.
* **D: Umshini wokudlala iNintendo Revolution** (Nintendo Revolution gaming machine): This refers to the console, not the controller.



"
Yini engazange ishiwo embikweni wakamuva ovela kuyi-ejensi ezindaba zaseXinhau?,"The correct answer is **B: Ibhanoyi lihlale e-Ürümqi** (The plane stayed in Ürümqi).

Here's why:

The passage states the plane was *denied* landing in Ürümqi and then diverted to Afghanistan. It doesn't say it stayed in Ürümqi at all. The later report details it being diverted to Kandahar after a bomb threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibhanoyi lithole izinsongo zokuthi kunebhomu** (The plane received bomb threats) - This *is* mentioned in the later reports.
*   **C: Ibhanoyi lichezukiselwe e-Afghanistan** (The plane was diverted to Afghanistan) - This is also mentioned.
*   **D: Ibhanoyi lihlale eKandahar** (The plane stayed in Kandahar) - The report states it *landed* in Kandahar, implying it's there, though doesn't explicitly confirm it stayed. However, this is information *from* the later report and doesn't say it wasn’t mentioned.

Therefore, the only thing not mentioned in the later report is that the plane remained in Ürümqi."
Yini engashiwongo embikweni wokuqala ovela kuyi-enjensi yezindaba zaseXinhau?,"The correct answer is **B: Ibhanoyi alizange livunyelwe ukuhlala ngokwezimo eziphuthumayo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the initial reports said the plane was diverted *after* being denied landing due to emergency conditions in Ürümqi. The Xinhua report initially only mentioned the diverted plane, not the bomb threat. The bomb threat and the Kandahar diversion are described as *later* reports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ibhanoyi lathunjwa** - The initial report *did* mention the plane was diverted, but not why.
*   **C: Ibhanoyi lachezukiselwa emuva e-Afghanistan** - This information came in later reports.
*   **D: Ibhanoyi lithole izinsongo zokuthi kunebhomu** - The bomb threat information is also from later reports.



"
"Phakathi nohlelo lwasemsakazweni, yini eyamenyezelwa uSara Danius?","The correct answer is **D: Ikomiti lizoyeka ukuxhumana noBob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Sara Danius announced the committee is ""giving up its attempts to reach"" Bob Dylan. This directly corresponds to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Owawina uMkolelo weNobel Ezincwadini** - The passage doesn't announce a winner, it discusses the difficulty in contacting the winner.
*   **B: Ikomiti alizange lithole impendulo kubahlanganyeli** - The passage says they *did* receive ""friendly responses,"" so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Abaqokiwe ngo-2016 kuMklomelo WeNobel Ezincwadini** - The text focuses on contacting the winner, not the nominees.



"
Ubani ongazange atholakale lapho kuxhunyanwa naye?,"The correct answer is **D: UBob Dylan**.

The passage explicitly states the committee has been unable to reach Bob Dylan directly despite winning the Nobel Prize in Literature and have stopped trying *for now*. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abahlanganyeli bakaBob Dylan** - They *were* contacted and responded with ""friendly replies"".
*   **B: USara Danius** - She is the one making the announcement, so she is clearly accessible.
*   **C: ISwedish Academy** - The passage states *the committee* within the Academy is having trouble reaching Dylan, implying the Academy itself is not unreachable."
Ubani owaphawula mayelana nesithembiso “sesinyathelo esikhulu”?,"The correct answer is **C: U-Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage states: ""Umkhulumeli kaBush uGordon Johndroe ubize isithembiso seNyakatho Korea """"ngesinyathelo esiyinhloko emgomweni wokususwa kwezikhali zenuzi okungafakazelwa enhlonhlweni yaseKorea.""""""  This means Gordon Johndroe made the statement about the promise being a ""significant step"".
"
USłania wakhiqiza izitembu ezingaki emazweni ahlukahlukene?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezicishe zibe ngu-2,000**.

Here's why:

The text states he made ""over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 for other countries.""  1000 + 28 = 1028, which is *close to* 2,000.  Option A is too high, and B is only the amount for Sweden.  Option D is incorrect as the text specifies 28 for other countries, implying the total isn't ""over 1,000"" for all countries combined."
"Ngokwendaba, yini engase ibe imbangela yokuvuza kwamathangi okungenisa nokukhipha umoya?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlolwa njalo okuhleliwe kwendlela okulawulwa ngayo umlilo** (Regular fire suppression system inspection).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The lack of power following a routine fire suppression system check caused a relief valve to open and crude oil spilled near Pump Station 9."" This directly links the spill to a failure related to a *routine inspection* of the fire suppression system, which led to a valve opening and the oil leak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indawo yesibili egcwaliswa ngomthamo** (Secondary containment area capacity) - While the secondary containment area is mentioned, it's not the *cause* of the spill, but rather a place to *catch* the spilled oil.
*   **C: Ukuvuleka kwethuluzi elikala ukushisa** (Temperature gauge malfunction) - The passage doesn't mention a temperature gauge malfunction.
*   **D: Umlilo kwenye yeziteshi eziphampayo eFort Greely** (Fire at one of the pump stations at Fort Greely) - The passage specifically identifies the leak near Pump Station 9, but doesn’t state anything about a fire at another station.



"
Kungani avuleka amavalvu akhululayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwaba nenkinga yamandla ngemva kokuba kuhloliwe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ukungabi khona kukagesi ngemva kokuhlolwa okuvamile kohlelo lwezicima-mlilo lubangele umgudu wokufutha ukuba uvuleke..."". This directly links the valve openings to a lack of power *after* a routine inspection of the fire suppression system. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't mention a temperature measuring device failure as the cause.
*   **C:** The text states another storage area was *not* full, not that the tanks were operating at full capacity.
*   **D:** The issue with the second storage area is presented as a separate issue, not the cause of the valve opening."
"Okwamanje, liphezulu kangakanani izinga lamanzi eNinth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Izinyawo ezingu-20**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iwodi Lesishiyagalolunye, elabonakala likhukhuleka ngamagxathu angu-20 phakathi Nesiphepho u-Katrina, okwamanje linamanzi asokhalweni..."" This directly translates to ""The Ninth Ward, which is currently flooded with water up to 20 steps from Hurricane Katrina..."" Since steps are likely referring to feet, the water level is 20 feet high.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amayintshi angu-6** - This is the amount of rain that *could* cause flooding, not the current water level.
*   **C: Afika enqulwini** - The text doesn't mention the water reaching a certain level such as the roof.
*   **D: Izinyawo ezingu-100** - The text only mentions the water overtopping the levee in a 100-foot *wide* section, not being 100 feet *high*.



"
"Phakathi neSiphepho uKatrina, yini eyenzeka eNinth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Amanzi ezikhukhula ayifinyelela ezilinganisweni sezinyathelo ezingu-100**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Iwodi Lesishiyagalolunye, elabonakala likhukhuleka ngamagxathu angu-20 phakathi Nesiphepho u-Katrina, okwamanje linamanzi asokhalweni njengoba amanzi elweqe ngaphezulu udonga lokuvimba amanzi oluseduze. Amanzi ayachitheka ngaphezu kohide lwezindundumela engxenyeni engamafidi angu-100 ububanzi."" This directly translates to the Ninth Ward being flooded with water that reached levels of 100 feet wide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amanzi ayefika kwinqulu edlula udonga:** While the text mentions water *overtopping* the floodwall, it doesn't say it reached a peak above it.
*   **C: Amanzi ezikhukhula ayeyizinyathelo ezingu-20 ukuphakama:** The text mentions 20 steps *between* the flood and Katrina, not the height of the flood itself.
*   **D: Amayintshi angu-6 emvula eyayina alimaza udonga:** The text mentions 6 inches of rain relating to previous levee failures, not specifically the flooding during Katrina.



"
Yini kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kuqinisekiswe uHamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Amathuba okuba ezinye iziguli zithole igciwane**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""UHamilton uqinisekise ukuthi Isibhedlela saseNyuvesi yaseHoward samukele isiguli sisesimweni esizinzile."" and ""Izibhedlela zilandele imithetho yokulawula ukutheleleka, okuhlanganisa ukuhlukanisa iziguli kwezinye ukuze kugwenywe ukutheleleka.""
*   **A:** The passage confirms the hospital the patient was admitted to (Howard University Hospital).
*   **C:** The passage confirms protocols were followed.
*   **D:** The passage confirms the patient's condition was stable.
*   **B:** The passage does *not* provide information about the probability of other patients contracting the virus. It mentions measures to *prevent* spread, but doesn't assess the risk.

Therefore, Hamilton did not confirm the chances of other patients getting the virus."
Yini lena ososayensi abazama ukuyiqonda?,"The correct answer is **D: Indlela uMhlaba owakheke ngayo** (How the Earth was formed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ososayensi banethemba lokuqonda indlela amapulanethi akheka ngayo, ikakhulukazi indlela uMhlaba owakheke ngayo..."" (Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed...).  The entire passage revolves around the idea that meteorites hold clues to Earth's formation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention the timing of meteor impacts.
*   **B:** While the passage mentions proteins, it doesn't focus on *how* they form, but rather that meteorites contained the building blocks for them.
*   **C:** The passage mentions living things, but the focus is on their origins relating to Earth's formation, not defining what living things *are*.

"Ngokwendaba, iyiphi indima amaphoyisa endawo ayidlala ekuvaleni?","The correct answer is **C: Aqondisa abashayela izimoto ukuba baphume ngenye indlela**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""usizo lwamaphoyisa angu-80 belukhona ukuqondisa abashayeli bezimoto kwezinye izindlela."" This means the local police were directing drivers to alternative routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akhuthaza iFBI ukuba ivale:** The text says the Maryland Transportation Authority closed it *because* requested by the FBI, not that police urged the FBI to do so.
*   **B: Anquma ukuvala:** The Maryland Transportation Authority made the decision to close it.
*   **D: Abika isiminyaminya ezindaweni obekungaphunywa ngazo:** The passage doesn't mention police reporting suspicious activity, only that trucks were being used to block entrances.



"
Kwenzekani endaweni esapayipi yokudlula phakathi nokuvalwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ayevaliwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Maryland Transportation Authority closed the tunnels ""to block access points to the underground highway."" This directly implies the area *was* closed. The rest of the passage describes how traffic was being redirected *because* of the closure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ayesetshenziselwa ukuphuma ngenye indlela** - The passage says police were redirecting traffic *to* other routes, not using the tunnels as a route themselves.
* **C: Ayevulekele labo abahamba ngezimoto** - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: Kwakuhamba izimoto eziyisiminyaminya** - The passage doesn't mention any specific types of vehicles continuing to use the area. It focuses on closing it down.

"Ngokwendaba, yini engazange yenzeke ngaphambi kokuba umthwebuli wezithombe eshayiswe imoto?","The correct answer is **A: Umthwebuli wezithombe wayalwa iPhoyisa Lasemgwaqweni Omkhulu ukuba abuyele emuva ngale komgwaqo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...okwashukumisa iphoyisa leCalifornia Highway Patrol elalivimebezele izimoto ukuba limyalele ukuthi a welelele emuva, kabili."" This directly translates to the highway patrol officer signaled the photographer to move back twice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says the photographer *did* park his car on Sepulveda Boulevard.
*   **C:** The passage says the photographer *was trying* to take pictures of the police blockade.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the photographer taking a picture of Bieber.



"
Yini umthwebuli wezithombe ayezama ukuyenza ngaphambi kokuba ashayiswe yimoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Washutha izithombe zalapho amaphoyisa ayevimbe khona**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...umthathi wezithombe wamisa imoto yakhe kolunye uhlangothi lweSepulveda Boulevard futhi **wazama ukuthatha izithombe zamaphoyisa** ayevimbezele..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wapaka eSepulveda Boulevard** - While true, this is *what he did* to *then* try to take photos, not the primary action.
*   **C: Wawela umgwaqo omkhulu obhizi** - He *ended up* in the road, but the text doesn't say this was intentional.
*   **D: Wayenga iphoyisa ukuba limvumele aqhubeke nokushutha izithombe** - The text doesn't mention any interaction with the police beyond them being the subject of the photos.

Isiphi isitatimende esingachazi ngokunembile isimo sikamongameli ngemva kokuthola ukuthi unegciwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Akazizwa kahle** (He doesn't feel well).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: **""Ngaphandle kwemfiva nomminzo obuhlungu, ngizizwa ngikahle futhi ngikulungele ukwenza umsebenzi wami ngokuxhumana ngocingo.""** (Despite the fever and sore throat, I feel well and am ready to do my job remotely). This directly contradicts the statement that he doesn't feel well.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Umphimbo wakhe ubuhlungu** (He has a sore throat) - The passage explicitly mentions ""umminzo obuhlungu"" (a sore throat).
*   **C: Isimo sakhe sizinzile** (His condition is stable) - The passage states ""Isimo sikamongameli sizinzile"" (The President's condition is stable).
*   **D: Unomkhuhlane** (He has a fever) - The passage states ""Ngaphandle kwemfiva..."" (Despite the fever...)."
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo esiyiqiniso ngomongameli?","The correct answer is **C: Uphile ngokwanele ukuthi engaxhumana nabanye ngocingo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ngaphandle kwemfiva nomminzo obuhlungu, ngizizwa ngikahle futhi ngikulungele ukwenza umsebenzi wami ngokuxhumana ngocingo."" (Apart from the fever and sore throat, I feel well and am ready to do my job by communicating by phone).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akanawo umkhuhlane** - The passage specifically says he *has* a fever (""emfiva"").
*   **B: Uzohlala ekhaya amasonto ambalwa** - The passage states he will isolate at home for ""izinsukwana"" (a few days), not weeks (""amasonto ambalwa"").
*   **D: Unegciwane elibi** - While he has a virus, it's described as ""not very virulent"" (elingelibi kakhulu), meaning not severe. So ""elibi"" (bad) is not accurate."
"Ngokwendaba, kwakulindeleke ukuba Isiphepho uGonu siqhubeke sidamba nini?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho umoya wehla uya kuyisivinini samakhilomitha angu-83 ngehora**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngasekuseni namuhla, imimoya cishe beyiku-83 km/h, futhi bekulindeleke ukuthi iqhubeke iphelelwa amandla."" (This morning, the winds were about 83 km/h, and it was expected to continue weakening.)

This directly indicates that the cyclone was expected to weaken *after* the wind speed dropped to 83 km/h.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngaphambi kokuba sifike eMaldives:** The text doesn't mention when it was expected to weaken *relative to* reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: Ngaphambi kokuba sifinyelele uvuthondaba:** ""uvuthondaba"" (peak) isn't specifically mentioned as the point where it was expected to weaken.
*   **D: Ngaphambi kokuba imimoya ifinyelele isivinini samamayela angu149 ngehora:** The text states it *had* winds of 240 km/h, but that doesn’t mean it was expected to weaken before reaching that speed. It was at its strongest *when* it had those speeds.



"
Wawushesha kangakanani umoya ovithondabeni lweSiphepho uGonu?,"The correct answer is **C: Angamamayela angu-149 ngehora**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Lapho sinamandla khona, Isiphepho i-Gonu...saba nemimoya engamakhilomitha angu-240 ngehora (amamayela ayi-149 ngehora).""
* The question asks for the *speed* of the wind at the cyclone's peak.  The text explicitly gives this speed in miles per hour as 149 mph.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Angamakhilomitha angu-149 ngehora - This is kilometers per hour, not miles per hour, and represents a different speed.
* **B:** Angamamayela angu-240 ngehora - This is incorrect; 240 mph is not the speed stated in the text.
* **D:** Angamakhilomitha angu-83 ngehora - This represents the wind speed *this morning*, after the cyclone had already weakened, not its peak speed.

*   **The passage states:** *Karenia brevis, isidalwa sasolwandle sengqamuzana elilodwa...* (Karenia brevis, a single-celled marine organism...) This clearly indicates it's a *single*-celled organism, not one with many cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhlobo oluthile lolwelwe (A type of algae):** The passage directly identifies *Karenia brevis* as a type of algae (""isidalwa sasolwandle sengqamuzana"").
*   **B: Ingakhubaza inzwa yomuntu (It can disable human senses):** The passage states the algae produces toxins that irritate the senses in both humans and marine life.
*   **D: Yenzeka ngokwemvelo (Occurs naturally):** The passage says it occurs ""ngokwemvelo"" (naturally).



"
Yini kulokhu okulandelayo isici seKarena engakwazi ukukwenza?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukukhiqiza ushevu othinta izinzwa** (To produce toxins that affect the senses).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *Kareniya brevis* produces **toxins that irritate the senses** in both humans and marine life.
*   Option A is incorrect because the text doesn't say it affects the sense of smell.
*   Option B is incorrect because the bloom happens when conditions are *ideal*, not under any condition.
*   Option C is incorrect because the organism *is* in the water, it doesn't affect the water.

Therefore, the best answer based on the text is that *Karenia brevis* can produce toxins that affect the senses."
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kwenzeke ngenxa yeSiphepho uFelicia?","The correct answer is **D: Izikhukhula ezisemgwaqweni** (Injuries on the roads).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nakuba njengamanje, ayikho imibiko yomonakalo noma **izikhukhula ebekhona**"" (although currently, there are no reports of damage or **injuries present**).  This directly indicates that there were *no* reported injuries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imvula enezinzuzo** (Beneficial rain) - The passage explicitly states the rain was ""described as 'beneficial'"".
*   **B: Imvula ehambisana nombani** (Rain accompanied by lightning) - The passage mentions ""one of the rains was accompanied by thunder and numerous lightning strikes.""
*   **C: Umbani oqhubeka njalo** (Continuous thunder) - While it doesn't say continuous thunder, it does confirm a lot of lightning, implying frequent thunder.



"
Isiphi isitatimende esingelona iqiniso mayelana neSiphepho uFelicia?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwaqale kwacatshangwa kuyinto eshisayo ngaphambi kokujika kube seSigabeni 4 sesiphepho**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Felicia *weakened* due to warm waters, not that it *started* as a warm-core system. It was a Category 4 hurricane that *lost* strength.  The other statements are directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Imvula eyazuzisa i-Oahu** - The passage explicitly calls the rain ""beneficial.""
*   **C: Iziqhingi eziningi zaba nemvula** - The passage mentions ""numerous reefs experiencing surges.""
*   **D: Ezinye izimvula zazihambisana nokubanika** - The passage states some rain was accompanied by lightning and many tornadoes.



"
Isiphi isitatimende esiwubonisa ngokunembile umphumela wango-2009 waseHungary weGrand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: UPiquet Jr. waxoshwa ngemva kwalokho**.

The passage specifically states: ""UPiquet Jr. waxoshwa ngemva kwe-Grand Prix yase-Hungary ka-2009."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: UFernando Alonso waba sengozini yemoto** - The passage doesn't mention Alonso having an accident in Hungary.
*   **B: UPiquet Jr. wadla umhlanganiso** - The passage doesn't mention anything about Piquet Jr. crashing.
*   **D: Imoto ephephile yaba sengozini** - The passage doesn't mention the safety car being in an accident.



"
Yenzeka nini leyo ngozi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngokusheshe nje ngemva kokuba u-Alonso ethathe ikhefu kancane endaweni lapho izimoto zima khona**.

Here's why:

The text states Piquet Jr. crashed ""ngemuva nje kokumela kancane ngokushesha u-Fernando Alonso"". This translates to ""just after briefly letting Fernando Alonso past"". This directly corresponds to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The text doesn't specifically mention cars being refueled at the time of the crash.
*   **C:** The crash *resulted* in the safety car being deployed, but didn't happen before it.
*   **D:** The text doesn't mention Piquet refueling before the crash.

"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okwathatha isikhathi esincane kunaleso abacwaningi ababesikholelwa kwasekuqaleni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuziphendukela kwezinto eziphilayo** (The evolution of organisms).

Here's why:

The text states, ""ubacwaningi babike ukuthi izidalwa ezintsha ziziphendukele ngezizukulwane ezimbili kuphela, *nakuba lenqubo bekukholelwa ukuthi ithatha isikhathi eside*..."" This directly means the *evolution* happened much faster than originally thought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukwakheka kwezinto eziphilayo** (The creation of organisms) - The article discusses how existing organisms changed, not how they were initially created.
*   **B: Ukubika mayelana nezinto eziphilayo** (Reporting on organisms) - This refers to the scientists *reporting* the findings, not the biological process itself.
*   **C: Ukuzalanisa phakathi kwezinto eziphilayo** (Breeding between organisms) - While breeding is part of the process, the key point is *how quickly* the resulting population changed (evolved).



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubikwe abacwaningi?,"The correct answer is **C: Igama lento ephilayo entsha**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The research reports the *formation of new species* of birds, but it **doesn't give the name** of this new species. It only mentions the two finch species that interbred to create it (Geospiza fortes and Geospiza conirostris).

Let's look at why the other options *are* covered in the passage:

*   **A: Zakheka kuphi izinto eziphilayo** (Where living things were formed) - The passage clearly states the new species arose on the Galápagos Islands.
*   **B: Ubude besikhathi sokuziphendukela kwezinto** (The length of time for evolution) - The passage specifically highlights that evolution occurred in only two generations, which was surprisingly fast.
*   **D: Inyoni eyaba neqhaza ekuzalaniseni** (The bird involved in breeding) - The passage names the two finch species that hybridized: *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*.

"
Izoba kuphi iCowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Edolobheni laseBucharest**.

The text specifically states that Bucharest will be the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the CowParade. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Emadolobheni amaningana aseRoma:** The text focuses on Bucharest, not multiple cities in Romania.
*   **C: Phakathi neningizimu-mpumalanga neYurophu:** This describes a *region*, not a specific location for the event.
*   **D: Ezinhlokodolobha eziningana zaseYurophu:** While CowParade has been in many European capitals, the text says Bucharest is the first in *Southeastern* Europe.



"
Yiziphi izitatimende ezilandelayo eziyichaza ngokunembile iCowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Umciphi womphakathi wezobuciko omkhulu kakhulu emhlabeni**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states CowParade is ""the largest global art event"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't limit CowParade to ""art cities."" Bucharest is hosting it to *become* known as a cultural center.
*   **B:** The Bucharest City Hall is *hosting* the event, it didn't found CowParade.
*   **C:** The passage specifies Bucharest will be the first city in *Southeastern Europe* to host it, not that the event is happening throughout the region.



"
Yini eyabangela ukuba iRussia ivale ukusetshenziswa kwe-II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingozi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Russia grounded Il-76s temporarily after that accident."" This directly links the grounding of the planes to the accident that occurred in October, where an engine failed during takeoff.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amasosha angaphakathi (Internal troops):** While the plane was heading towards internal troops, this wasn't the reason for the grounding.
*   **C: Amasosha aseSoviet (Soviet troops):** The Soviet Union history is background information, not the cause of the grounding.
*   **D: Uphenyo olusamile (Ongoing investigation):** While there *is* an investigation, the text states the grounding happened *after* the accident, not because of the investigation itself. The investigation is a consequence of the accident.



"
Iyini i-II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Ibhanoyi**.

The text states: ""I-Il-76 ibe isici esikhulu kokubili sebutho laseRashiya kanye naseSoviet Union kusukela ngawo-1970..."" This translates to ""The Il-76 has been a major asset for both the Russian and Soviet armies since the 1970s..."" An Il-76 is a type of airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umkhumbi ohamba ngaphansi kwamanzi** (Submarine) - A submarine travels underwater, not in the air.
*   **B: Umbayimbayi** (Bus) - A bus travels on roads.
*   **D: Istimela** (Train) - A train travels on rails.



"
Ubani owaqasha iqembu lababhali ohlelweni oluthi The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: USimon**.

The text states: ""Ngo-1989 wasiza ukwakha i-The Simpsons no-Brooks kanye no-Groening, futhi wayenomthwalo wemfanelo wokuqasha iqembu lohlelo lokubhala lokuqala."" This directly indicates Simon was responsible for hiring the writing team."
"NgokweFluke, ubani owathumela ukuphawula kwakhe okuhle kanye nesikhuthazo?","The correct answer is **D: Kokubili abesilisa nabesifazane**.

The text states Fluke reached her conclusion because of ""positive commentary and encouragement...sent by both individual women and men"" requesting contraception be considered a healthcare need."
"Ngokwendaba, yini abanye abantu ababengafuni abesifazane bakhulume ngayo?","The correct answer is **C: Impilo yabesifazane**.

The passage states that some people tried to prevent women from talking about **women's health**. The other options are not mentioned as being the subject of the attempted blockage.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yimuphi umzimba wamapulanethi onamandla kakhulu?","The correct answer is **A: I-Earth**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...iyodwa kuphela iplanethi ekwazi ukuveza amandla njenge-Titan, futhi igama layo uMhlaba” ( ""...is the only planet that can express power like Titan, and its name is Earth""). 

Therefore, according to the text, Earth is the planetary body with the most power."
Imifula kanye namadamu anoketshezi olukwazi ukubonakala ngale aye aziwa kumaphi amapulanethi?,"The correct answer is **B: ITitan**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ngokwazi kwethu, iyodwa kuphela iplanethi ekwazi ukuveza amandla njenge-Titan..."" and describes liquid-like features (like rivers and visible ground through the liquid) similar to what we see on Earth with water.  This directly connects the presence of liquid and visible features to Titan.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Jupiter:** Primarily a gas giant, though it has a complex atmosphere.
*   **ILanga (The Sun):** A star, composed of plasma, not liquids.
*   **ISaturn (Saturn):** A gas giant, similar to Jupiter.



"
Yiziphi kulezi zinto ezicwaningiwe ezingewona umphumela wocwaningo olwengeziwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuqonda mayelana nokuthi izimpaphe zazingasetshenziswa uma kudizwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the feathers were *not* used for flight.** It specifically says they were likely used for thermoregulation (controlling body heat) and display. The research suggests the structure points *against* flight.

Let's look at why the other options are results of the research:

* **A: Umbala wezimpaphe zesilwane (Color of the animal's feathers):** The passage explicitly mentions scientists determined the plumage had a reddish-brown upper side and banding on the edges.
* **C: Ukuqonda mayelana nokuziphendukela kwezimpaphe (Understanding about the evolution of feathers):** The research provides insights into feather evolution, specifically the order in which features developed.
* **D: Ukuqinisekisa ukuthi ama-dinosaur ayenezimpaphe (Confirming that dinosaurs had feathers):** The passage begins by stating the research confirms dinosaurs had feathers, even though it was a widely held belief.



"
Yini izimpaphe zama-dinosaur ayengenazo?,"The correct answer is **A: AmaBarbule**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that dinosaur feathers *did* have barbs and barbules, but lacked a fully developed rachis (the central shaft of a feather). It also states the feathers had structures *like* barbules. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Into enjengomgogodla** - The passage does not mention anything relating to a quill.
*   **C: Izimpaphe zezilwane esezikhulile** - The passage states the sample shows adult feathers, not juvenile plumage.
*   **D: Umbala ophaphathekile ngaphansi** - The passage states the feathers had a reddish-brown upper color and iridescence on the sides, not a fluffy underside.



"
Yiziphi izitatimende ezilandelayo ezingelona iqiniso mayelana neZMapp?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikwazi ukwelapha ukugula okukhona kodwa akukuvimbeli ukufa.**

Here's why, based on the text provided:

*   The text specifically states: ""...ayikho imithi eboniswe ngokucacile ukuthi ifanelekela ukulapha isifo esikhona."" (Currently, no drugs have been clearly shown to be effective for treating an existing illness.) and ""...ucwaningo kubonisa ukuthi inomthelela omncane kunalowo obucatshwangwa ekuvimbeleni ukufa."" (research shows it has less impact than initially thought in preventing death.) This directly contradicts statement B.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true according to the text:

*   **A: Zenziwe ngamasosha omzimba** - The passage begins by stating ""Nakuba umjovo wokulinga ubonakala ukwazi ukunciphisa ukufa okubangelwa yi-Ebola..."" meaning it's made of antibodies.
*   **C: Isebenza njengento elawulayo kuyiPALM** - The text says ""I-ZMapp yasebenza njengesifaniso, okusho ukuthi ososayensi bayisebenzisa njengesiqalo sokuqhathanisa futhi baqhathanisa amanye amakhambi amathathu okwelapha nayo."" (ZMapp acted as a control, meaning scientists used it as a starting point for comparison.)
*   **D: Ucwaningo lubonisa ukuthi izinzuzo zayo zincane kunalezo ebekucatshangwa ukuthi zizoba yizo** - This is stated directly in the text: ""...inomthelela omncane kunalowo obucatshwangwa ekuvimbeleni ukufa."" (has less impact than initially thought in preventing death).



"
Yiziphi izitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo ezikuchaza ngokuchaza ngokunembile ukusebenza kwePALM?,"The correct answer is **B: Isidakamizwa esiqondiswayo saqhathaniswa nezinto zokwelapha ezintathu, enye yazo kwakuyiZMapp**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a comparator, meaning scientists used it as a starting point to compare it with three other experimental treatments."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ucwaningo lubonisa ukuthi kungase kube nezinzuzo eziningi kunalokho obekucatshangwa ngaphambili** - The passage doesn't state that there are more benefits than previously thought, only that ZMapp's effect was less than initially hoped.
*   **C: IZMapp yasetshenziswa ngesizathu sokuhlola** - While ZMapp was *used* in the trial, it was used as a *comparator* or baseline, not simply for testing.
*   **D: Kwabonakala sengathi iyasebenza ekwelapheni izifo ezikhona** - The passage specifically says ZMapp showed ""limited effect"" in preventing death, contradicting this statement.



"
Abacwaningi bacabanga ukuthi lolu cwephe olusha lungasebenza kakhulu kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emazweni lapho abantu bakhona behola imali encane**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the tool could be crucial in poorer countries where survival rates for diseases like breast cancer are significantly lower than in wealthier nations.  The other options are not mentioned or relevant to the passage.
"
Iyiphi indlela ezosetshenziswa ekwakheni ithuluzi lokwelapha?,"The correct answer is **A: Isenti lase-U.S elilodwa** (One U.S. cent).

The text states the tool, Elisha, can distinguish microbes and is ""a tiny, flexible device that can be manufactured using standard microfabrication techniques at a cost of one U.S. cent."" This means the tool is created using techniques that allow for production at a very low cost - one cent.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umshini wokuprinta oyiStandard** (Standard printer): The text refers to *microfabrication* which is much more precise than standard printing.
*   **C: Ucwecwe olungakwazi ukuprinteka** (Printable circuit): While it may involve circuitry, the key detail is the incredibly low cost and microfabrication, not just printability.
*   **D: Elinye ithuluzi lokulungisa** (Another fixing tool): This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific information given.



"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende esimayelana nezinto ezikwamanye amapulanethi okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Akutholakalanga okuningi kwakho ebusweni benyanga**.

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states the lobate scarps are found ""all over the Moon."" This directly contradicts the statement that not much has been found on the Moon's surface.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: Izinto ezenza lezi zinto kungenzeka ukuthi zisanda kwenzeka** - The passage says the scarps appear slightly eroded, indicating *recent* geological activity.
*   **B: Ukuba khona kwazo kusho ukuthi inyanga ayiyisweli imisebenzi yamatshe** - This is the main point of the passage - the scarps challenge the idea that the Moon is geologically dead.
*   **C: Kungase kube imiphumela yokuncipha kwenyanga** - The passage specifically links the scarps to the Moon shrinking.



"
"Ngokwendaba, ikuphi ukusikisela mayelana nokwakheka komhlaba okubonisa ukuthi kunemisebenzi yamatshe eyenzeka enyangeni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwakheka komhlaba kwenzeka cishe muva nje**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the lobate scarps ""appear to have formed from gradual shrinking of the Moon"" and indicate ""relatively recent geologic activity.""** This directly supports the idea that geological formation (and thus, activity) has been happening *relatively recently* on the Moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kancane kancane inyanga iyancipha** - While the passage *mentions* the Moon shrinking, it's the shrinking *resulting* in the landforms that indicates activity, not just the shrinking itself.
* **B: Ukwakheka komhlaba kwenzeka kudala kakhulu** - The passage contradicts this; the features suggest *recent* activity.
* **C: Kumane kunesilinganiso esincane sokwakheka ebusweni benyanga** -  The passage implies these features are widespread (""found all over the Moon"") meaning it's not just a small amount of formation.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engeke ibe khona kakhulu kuze kube ukuthi sekubekwe icala?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphawula okwengeziwe** (Further comment).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Crown Office (the body leading the investigation) has told reporters they ""will not comment at least until the trial."" This directly means further statements or comments will be withheld until the trial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izithombe zezincwadi** (Book images) - The passage doesn't mention anything about book images.
* **C: Izingxoxo ngokuphathelene nobufakazi bofakazi bokuzibonela** (Discussions regarding eyewitness evidence) - The passage states this evidence *might* be compromised, but doesn't say discussion about it will be stopped.
* **D: Izihloko zezincwadi** (Book titles) - Similar to B, this isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engayona inkinga yamuva mayelana nezinto zokuvikela?","The correct answer is **A: Izimo zezulu ezimbi kakhulu** (Severe weather conditions).

Here's why:

The text states that ""severe weather conditions were disrupting the harvesting efforts."" It further elaborates that Pittman believes the weather won't improve for a week. While ice is *part* of the problem, the overall issue, and what's hindering things the most, is the *severe weather*. The passage emphasizes the widespread impact of the bad weather, comparing it to conditions from 15 years ago, which is a broader issue than just the amount or type of ice.



"
"Ngaphezu kweqhwa, yini enye engaba umthelela emsebenzini wokusindisa?","The correct answer is **B: Izimo zezulu**.

Here's why:

The text states ""isimo sezulu esibi kakhulu sasiphazamisa imizamo yokuhlenga"" (bad weather was disrupting rescue efforts). It goes on to say Pittman doesn't expect the weather to improve for a week. This directly indicates that the weather is a significant factor hindering the rescue work, *in addition to* the ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukwentuleka kwezinsiza** (Lack of resources) - The text doesn't mention anything about a lack of resources.
*   **C: Ukungatholakali kosizo** (Unavailability of help) - The text doesn't mention problems with getting assistance.
*   **D: Abezokuvikela** (Rescuers) - The text focuses on the *impact* on rescuers, not the rescuers themselves being a problem.



"
Iyiphi inkolelo uRoberts akuxwaya ukuyiqinisekisa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqala kwempilo (The beginning of life)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""URoberts wenqaba ngokuphelele ukusho ukuthi ukholelwa ukuthi impilo iqala nini"" (Roberts completely refuses to say what he believes about when life begins). He is *avoiding* stating his belief on this topic. The passage highlights this as the key issue he won't address.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuziphatha kahle lapho kuxoxwa ngamacala (Proper behavior when discussing cases):** While the passage mentions ethical considerations, Roberts isn't avoiding confirming a belief about proper behavior.
*   **B: Ukubaluleka kokukhishwa kwesinqumo esifanayo yiNkantolo Ephakeme (The importance of the Supreme Court issuing the same decision):** He *stated* his belief about the importance of consistent Supreme Court rulings; he didn't avoid confirming it.
*   **D: Ilungelo lokuba nemfihlo (The right to privacy):** He *confirmed* his belief that Roe v. Wade relied on a right to privacy; he didn't avoid confirming it.



"
Isiphi isihloko uRobert ayenomuzwa wokuthi akufaneleki ukuba kuxoxwe ngaso?,"The correct answer is **D: Amacala athile**.

Here's why:

The passage states URoberts ""wenqaba ngokuphelele ukusho ukuthi impilo iqala nini, umbuzo obalulekile uma ucabanga ngezimiso zokuziphatha, ethi kuyoba ukuziphatha okungamukeleki ukuphawula ngezici ezithile zezimo ezingenzeka."" This means he completely refused to comment on *specific characteristics of potential life*, effectively deeming it a topic he felt shouldn't be discussed or commented on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukukhishwa kwesinqumo esifanayo eNkantolo Ephakeme** - He *did* discuss and emphasize the importance of the Catholic Church consistently issuing the same rulings.
*   **B: Isinqumo esiphakathi kukaRoe noWade** - He directly addressed and commented on the Roe v. Wade decision.
*   **C: Ilungelo lokusho izinto eziyimfihlo** - He affirmed his belief in the right to privacy underpinning the Roe decision.



"
Zikhanya kuphi izinsika zokukhanya ezicwebezelayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngasesibhakabhakeni (In the sky)**.

The text states: ""Imisebe yokukhanya emibili yanyuka ukuze ibheke emkhathini phakathi nobusuku."" This directly translates to ""Two beams of light rose to look at the sky at night."" Therefore, the beams of light are in the sky.



"
"Ngokwendaba, amabhilidi amakhulu zokwakhiwa nini endaweni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwakhiwa kuyaqhubeka** (Construction is ongoing).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umsebenzi wokwakha amabhilidi amahlanu amade uyaqhubeka endaweni yesakhiwo..."" This directly translates to ""The construction of five tall buildings is *ongoing* in the construction area..."" 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phakathi nosuku** (During the day) - The text doesn't specify *when* construction happens, only that it *is* happening.
*   **B: Ngo-8:46 ekuseni.** (At 8:46 am) - This is when the city was quiet and the first plane took off, not when construction is happening.
*   **C: Phakathi nobusuku** (During the night) - This refers to when the lights went on, not the construction.



"
Ikuphi ukwaziswa okusikisela ukuthi iSeven Sisters iyimigede?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlukahluka kwamazinga okushisa (Temperature fluctuations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izithombe eziveza ukushisa zibonisa ukuthi ukuhlukahlukana kokushisa kwasebusuku nasemini kubonisa ukuthi zifana nomgede. """"Ipholile kunezindawo ezizizungezile emini futhi ifudumale ebusuku."""" This directly links the *temperature fluctuations* to a similarity with pits/caves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuvuleka kwendawo yokungena (Entrance openings)** - The passage mentions the size of the entrances but doesn't say this is what makes them like pits.
*   **C: Ucwaningo lwendawo yamatshe (Rock composition research)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about rock composition.
*   **D: Izithombe zemigede lapho useMhlabeni (Images of pits on Earth)** - While the passage *compares* them to Earth pits, it's the temperature behavior, not the images themselves, that suggests the similarity.



"
Kunjani ukushisa kuyiSeven Sisters okuphawuliwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuvuleka komgede** (The opening of a crater).

Here's why:

The passage states that the temperature fluctuations in the Seven Sisters are *similar to a crater*: ""…the variation in day-night temperatures suggests they are like craters. ‘Cooler than the surrounding terrain during the day and warmer at night.’""  This directly links the observed temperature behavior to that of a crater.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izithombe ze-infrared** (Infrared images) - While infrared images *were used to observe* the temperature, they aren't the *characteristic* of the heat itself.
*   **B: Kunemigodi ejulile phansi** (There are deep pits underground) - The passage compares the Seven Sisters to *deep pits in the ground*, but this isn't the defining characteristic of how the heat behaves.
*   **D: Ukuhlolwa kwemigede khona lapha eMhlabeni** (Crater studies here on Earth) -  The passage *uses* Earth craters as a comparison, but it's the behavior of the Seven Sisters that's being described.



"
"Ngokwencwadi, isiphi isitatimende mayelana nomsolwa esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **C: Ubuzwe bakhe buyaziwa abezomthetho** (His nationality is known to the authorities).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Igama lakhe alikaziwa iziphathimandla, nakuba zazi ukuthi uyilungu leqembu lohlanga lwe-Uighur."" This translates to ""His name is unknown to the authorities, although they know he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group."" Knowing someone is Uighur isn't the same as knowing their nationality.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the text:

*   **A: Wasebenzisa imoto phakathi nokuhlaselwa** (He used a car during the attack) - The text states he ""drove a three-wheeled vehicle with explosives.""
*   **B: Kusolakala sengathi waqhumisa iziqhumane** (He is suspected of detonating explosives) - The text states he's ""accused of bombing.""
*   **D: Wayengalimele** (He was unharmed) - The text says he was arrested ""after being injured in the explosion.""

Iyiphi imininingwane mayelana nokuhlasela esiqinisekiswe abezomthetho?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubuzwe bomsolwa** (The nationality of the suspect).

Here's why:

The text specifically states the authorities *know* the suspect is a member of the Uighur ethnic group. This is a detail about their nationality/ethnic origin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuthi ubani obebambisene naye** (Who the accomplice was) - The text doesn't mention any accomplices.
*   **C: Isisusa sokuhlasela** (The motive for the attack) - The text doesn't state *why* the attack happened, only *how* it happened (driving a vehicle into a crowd and being linked to a bombing).
*   **D: Igama nesibongo sowahlasela** (The name and surname of the attacker) - The text explicitly states the authorities *do not know* the suspect's name.



"
Iliphi iqembu elizodlala e-Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: ISouth Africa ne-Australia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umdlalo wokugcina womqhudelwano uzokwenzeka e-Ellis Park eGoli ngeviki elizayo, lapho ama-Springbok edlala ne-Australia."" 

*   ""AmaSpringbok"" is the name for the South African rugby team.
*   Therefore, South Africa and Australia are the teams playing at Ellis Park."
AmaSpringbok azowudlalela kuphi umdlalo wawo olandelayo?,"The correct answer is **C: EJohannesburg**.

The text states: ""Umdlalo wokugcina womqhudelwano uzokwenzeka e-Ellis Park eGoli ngeviki elizayo, lapho ama-Springbok edlala ne-Australia."" Ellis Park is in Johannesburg.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo labo abasebenza emkhathini ababa nenkinga yabo phakathi nohambo lwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukugcina ibanga elifanele emshinini wokuqondisa umshini okuhanjwa ngawo (Maintaining proper orientation with the spacecraft's attitude control system)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the station *lost* its gyroscope, which is crucial for attitude control (knowing which way is up/down/forward).  It then mentions the cosmonauts (Chiao and Sharipov) dealt with a *corrected attitude* of the spacecraft.  This means they had to work to re-establish and *maintain* the correct orientation after the gyroscope failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukugcina ithuluzi lokubonisa lapho umshini oya khona (Keeping the display tool where the machine goes)**: This doesn't relate to the described problem of controlling the station's position.
*   **C: Ukusebenza kwebhanoyi (Working on the hatch)**: The passage doesn't mention anything about the hatch.
*   **D: Ukuphinde ube sendaweni efanele (Getting back to the right place)**: While the station *returned* to normal, the issue was about *staying* oriented correctly *while* traveling, not just reaching a destination.



"
"Ngokwendaba, wawuyini umgomo walokho okwakuyokwenziwa emkhathini?","The correct answer is **B: Ukusondela nakakhulu ekulungiseni umshini wokuqondisa okuhanjwa ngawo.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the station *maintained its orientation* despite losing a gyroscope.  Chiao and Sharipov were involved with a *corrected orientation* for the crew. The Russian ground control then launched fighter jets and the *normal orientation of the station was restored*. This all points to the primary goal being fixing the navigation/orientation system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuthola ukuthi sikuphi nendawo:** While knowing location is important, the passage focuses on *maintaining and restoring* orientation, not simply finding it.
*   **C: Ukuphothula umsebenzi wasemkhathini:** The passage doesn't mention anything about completing a mission or task. It's focused entirely on a technical issue.
*   **D: Ukusebenzisa ibhanoyi:** This is irrelevant to the information given in the passage.



"
Yiziphi kulezi zitatimende mayelana necala ezingelona iqiniso?,"The correct answer is **D: I-AOL yatholakala inecala**.

Here's why:

The passage states the case was **dismissed** (""lokhu okokuqala ukulahlwa icala""), meaning AOL *did not* win the case and was not found guilty. 

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **A: Kwashushiswa embusweni lapho kukho khona indlukulu ye-AOL** - The passage states ""Icala lathethwa e-Virginia ngoba iyindawo eyinhloko yomhlinzeki we-inthanethi i-AOL,"" which means the case was heard where AOL is headquartered.
*   **B: Isinqumo ngecala sakhishwa** - The passage states the case was “dismissed”, which is a decision on the case.
*   **C: Umthetho mayelana nohlobo lwe-email engathembekile wasetshenziswa kuleli cala** - The passage clearly states the case used a 2003 law to prevent spam (""umthetho oshwaywe ngo-2003 wokunqanda ama-imeyili aya ebantwini abaningi"").



"
Yiziphi izitatimende ezilandelayo ezilichaza ngokunembile icala?,"The correct answer is **D: I-AOL yaqa ukushushisa kuleli cala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Icala laqulwa ngo-2003"" which means AOL *initiated* the case, not was sued. They are the plaintiff, seeking to stop spam.  Therefore, they are the ones pursuing legal action (""ushushisa"" translates to pursue legally).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-AOL yabekwa icala ngokusabalalisa izinto ezingagunyaziwe** - The passage says AOL *opened* the case, not that they were accused of sending unauthorized material.
* **B: Icala lihlanganisa abalawuli abakhulu bezinkonzo ze-inthanethi** - The passage only mentions AOL and Virginia, not wider internet service providers.
* **C: Icala laqulwa ngo-2003** -  The law used in the case was passed in 2003, but the case itself was filed later, using that law. The passage states the ruling was the *first* under that law, implying the case isn't from 2003 itself.



"
"Ngokwendaba, iliphi iqembu uVidal aqala ukulidlalela ezinkathini zonyaka ezintathu ezedlule?","The correct answer is **A: ISevilla**.

The passage states: ""UVidal oneminyaka engu-28 wayejoyine i-Barça kumasizini amathathu adlule, esuka e-Sevilla."" This translates to ""Vidal, 28 years old, joined Barça three seasons ago, coming from Sevilla."" Therefore, he was playing for Sevilla before joining Barça."
UVidal wadlala imidlalo emingaki kwiBarça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kusukela ngenkathi ethuthele enhlokodolobha yase-Catalan, uVidal udlalele iqembu imidlalo engu-49."" (Since moving to the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.)



"
Babedlala naliphi iqembu kulowo mdlalo?,"The correct answer is **B: IBolonia**.

The text explicitly states he was preparing for a game *against* Bolonia. The other options are locations or names of people, not the opposing team."
Kungani uJarque aqhubeka nokuhlala ehhotela?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwakudingeka azivocavoce**.

Here's why:

The passage states he was staying at the team hotel *before* a match against Bologna. It also mentions he was training. This strongly suggests he was staying at the hotel to be ready and prepared (i.e., ""azivocavoce"") for the game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wayenomhlangano ongaphambi kwenkathi yonyaka:** The passage doesn't mention a yearly meeting.
*   **C: Wayenomdlalo ngoMgqibelo:** The passage clearly states the match is on *Sunday*.
*   **D: Wayeziqeqesha neBolonia:** He was training *at* Coverciano, not with Bologna."
Kungani iJakarta i-ejensi yezinto eziphathelene nomhlaba ingazange ikhiphe isixwayiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Akuzange kulifinyelele izinga elidingekayo ukuze kube ukuzamazama komhlaba.**

The passage explicitly states: ""...asikho isixwayiso sesiphepho esizokhishwa ngoba lokhu kuzamazama komhlaba akufinyelelanga ubukhulu buka-6.5."" This means the earthquake wasn't strong enough to warrant a warning.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwakungekho ukusongela kwetsunami** - While true, this isn't *why* the warning wasn't issued. It's a *result* of the earthquake's magnitude.
*   **B: Ukugwema ukuthuka kubantu bendawo** - The passage indicates people *were* frightened and leaving, so avoiding fear wasn't the reason.
*   **C: Ukugwema ukuphazamisa amabhizinisi endawo** -  This is speculation and not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyabangelwa ukuzamazama?","The correct answer is **A: Ukwethuka kwabantu bendawo** (The panic of the locals).

Here's why:

The passage states that even though there was no tsunami warning, ""residents began to panic and started leaving their homes and businesses."" This means the *cause* of the activity described is the fear and panic of the people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukwesatshiswa itsunami** (A tsunami alert) - The passage specifically says there was *no* tsunami warning.
* **C: Isixwayiso esakhishwa** (An issued warning) - Again, the passage states no warning was issued.
* **D: Isilinganiso sokuzamazama esingu-6.5** (A magnitude of 6.5 earthquake) - The earthquake's magnitude is a *reason* why no warning was issued, not the *cause* of the residents' reaction.



"
Yiziphi kulezi zinto ekhuthaza ukusebenza kweLanga kanye nazo zonke izinkanyezi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukujikeleza kanye nokukhanya** (Rotation and light).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""the operation of all stars in the system is found to be governed by their light, their rotation, and nothing else.""
* While the Rossby number and plasma flow are *related* to rotation and light, the passage identifies *rotation and light* as the fundamental driving factors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukukhanya nokugeleza kwe-plasma (Light and plasma flow):** Plasma flow is a *result* of the interaction of light and rotation, not a primary driver.
* **B: Inombolo yeRossy , ukujikeleza, nokuguquka kukazibuthe (Rossy number, rotation, and magnetic field):** The Rossby number is a *calculation based on* rotation and light. The passage doesn't mention magnetic fields as a primary driver.
* **D: Ukukhanya, inombolo yeRossy kanye nokujikeleza (Light, Rossy number and rotation):** Again, the Rossby number is a consequence, not a cause.



"
Ibonakala kanjani inkanyezi yenombolo yeRossy?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngokukhanya nokujikeleza** (By its light and rotation).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that a star's Rossby number is determined *using* its light and rotation. The Rossby number then relates to plasma flow, but light and rotation are the *observable* characteristics used to *find* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngamanani okugeleza kweplasma** (By plasma flow values) - While the Rossby number *relates to* plasma flow, the passage says the number is calculated *from* light and rotation, not directly measured plasma flow.
* **C: Izigaba zokusebenza** (Operational phases) - The passage doesn't mention operational phases.
* **D: Inani lokuguqulwa kukazibuthe** (Number of isotope conversions) - This is not mentioned in the passage and irrelevant to the concept.



"
Lingakanani iphesenti labantu abahloliwe abasekela ukuba i-Australia ibe irepublic ngokushesha?,"The correct answer is **B: Amaphesenti angu-29**.

The text states: ""amaphesentu angu-29 walabo ababuzwe imibuzo bakholelwa ukuthi i-Australia kumelwe ibe yiriphabhuliki ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka"".
"
"NgokukaJulie Gillard, kufanele i-Australia ibe nini yi-republic?","The correct answer is **B: Ngemva kokubusa kweNdlovukazi u-Elizabeth II**.

The text states: ""UNdunankulu Wokunakekela uJulia Gillard wathi phakathi nomkhankaso wokhetho lwango-2010 wayekholelwa ukuthi i-Astralia kumelwe ibe izwe elibuswa ngentando yeningi ngemva kokubusa kweNdlovukazi uElizabeth II."" This directly translates to Julia Gillard believing Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
"
Iyiphi inhlangano engaphansi kokuphenywa ngokwezomthetho?,"The correct answer is **C: IPlanned Parenthood**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Inqubomgomo ka-Komen ukuyekise Ubuzali Obuhleliwe ngenxa yophenyo olusalindiwe..."" which translates to ""Komen's policy is to withdraw funding from Planned Parenthood due to a pending investigation..."". The rest of the passage details the investigation by Cliff Stearns that led to this decision.



"
I-Cliff Stearns iyinhloko yaliphi ikomiti?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""UStearns uphenya ukuthi ingabe intela isetshenziselwa ukuxhasa ukukhishwa kwezisu ngohlelo Lokuhlelela Ukuba Umzali njengomthwalo wakhe wemfanelo njengosihlalo we**Komiti Lokuhola kanye Nokuphenya**.""

This directly identifies Cliff Stearns as the chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engazange yenzeke kowesifazane waseSwitzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Izinto zakhe ezazebiwe zatholakala** (His stolen items were recovered).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sibophe abantu abahlanu abanukubeze ngokocansi owesifazane waseSwitzerland futhi simbuyisele ucingo lwakhe kanye ne-laptop"" - meaning they arrested the men and *returned* her phone and laptop. This implies the items were stolen and recovered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wabulawa (He was killed):** The passage does *not* mention the woman being killed.
* **C: Wadlwengulwa abantu abangu-5 (He was raped by 5 people):**  While the passage says the men *accused* of sexually assaulting her were arrested, it doesn't explicitly state that the assault *happened*.  (The phrasing is about arresting people who *attempted* the assault.)
* **D: Ifoni yakhe neLaptop kwantshontshwa (His phone and Laptop were stolen):** The passage indicates they were stolen *and then recovered*, so just saying they were stolen isn't the complete picture.



"
Iyiphi inkampani eyaklonyeliswa iTaiwan Sustainable Award ngo-2007?,"The correct answer is **C: I-ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kepha abathengi bekhompyutha ye-laptop bazohluka kakhulu futhi baguquke ngemva kokuba i-ASUS iklomeliswe Eklomelweni Wokulondoloza wase-Taiwan ngo-2007..."" 

Therefore, ASUS was the company awarded the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007."
Iyini ikhompyutha ye-ASUS Eee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ilaptop**.

The text specifically states ""I-ASUS Eee PC"" and refers to it as a ""khompyutha ye-laptop"" (laptop computer). The passage discusses its launch and impact on the laptop market.



"
Ubani owayenecala lokulahleka kwamadokhuyumenti eposi?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfana**.

The passage specifically states that ""a boy hid more than 600 pieces of mail in the post office,"" including the missing New Year's cards.
"
"Ngokwendaba, ubani owaxolisa mayelana nokulahleka kwamadokhuyumenti?","The correct answer is **D: Ihhovisi leposi lase-Obanazawa**.

The text states: ""Izolo, ihhovisi leposi lixolisile kubahlali kanye nakwabezindaba..."" (Yesterday, the post office apologized to residents and the media...). This directly indicates that the post office is the one who apologized.
"
UDel Potro waphumela nini obala ngenkinga yehlombe lakhe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngaphambi komdlalo wokubona ukuthi kuphumelela bani kwabalinganayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""U-Potro uthole ukwelashwa ehlombe ngaleso sikhathi kodwa wakwazi ukubuyela emdlalweni."" which directly means he received treatment *before* continuing to play the tie-break (umdlalo wokubona ukuthi kuphumelela bani kwabalinganayo).



"
Waba yini umphumela ngokubambana okokuqala?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwadliwa uMurray kuyisethi yokuqala**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""UMurray ulahlekelwe ingxenye yakhe yomdlalo emdlalweni wokubona ukuthi kuwina bani kwabalinganayo ngamaphuzu."" This directly means Murray lost the first set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kwadliwa uDel Potro kulandela ukulimala kwakhe** - The text says Del Potro *received* treatment for a shoulder injury but continued playing. It doesn’t say he lost because of it.
* **C: Kwawina uMurray kuyisethi yesibili** - The text says the second set went to a tie-break, meaning it wasn’t a straightforward win for Murray.
* **D: Kwawina uDel Potro kuyisethi yesibili** - Similar to C, the second set went to a tie-break, not a clear win for Del Potro.



"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, ubani ngokuqondile owachayekela esigulini?","The correct answer is **B: Ingane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: “Namhlanje, sifunde ukuthi ezinye izingane zeminyaka yezingane zesikole ziphawulwe ngokuthi zibeseduze nesiguli.” This directly indicates a child (or children) were identified as being near the patient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umbusi:** The passage only states the leader made a statement *about* someone being near the patient, not that they themselves were near the patient.
*   **C: Isikhulu saseTexas:** The passage doesn't mention any Texas official being near the patient.
*   **D: Izakhamuzi zendawo:** The passage specifically mentions ""izingane"" (children), not just general citizens.



"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isiqinisekiso umbusi angazange asenze lapho ekhuluma nezakhamuzi zaseTexas?","The correct answer is **D: Icala alikho bucayi**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* states the governor said, “Lolu daba lubucayi” (This matter is critical). Therefore, he *did* acknowledge the seriousness of the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhlelo lusebenza kahle** - He stated, “Qinisekani ukuthi uhlelo lwethu lusebenza kahle ngendlela okumelwe lusebenze ngayo.” (Make sure our system is working as it should be).
*   **B: Kwenziwa izinto ukuze kuvikelwe umphakathi** - He said, “Ehamba nalezo ziphathimandla, uqinisekise izakhamuzi zaseTexas ukuthi izinyathelo zazithathwa zokuvikela ukuphepha komphakathi.” (He assured Texas citizens that steps were being taken to protect public safety).
*   **C: Bakuhlomele ukubhekana nezinselele** - He said, “Kunezindawo ezimbalwa emhlabeni ezilungele kangcono ukuhlangabezana nenselele ekhona kulesi simo.” (There are few places in the world better prepared to meet the challenge at hand).



"
Yimuphi umthombo wezindaba owasungulwa ababengabafundi base-UW?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kudala ngaphambi koHlelo lwaNsukuzonke noMbiko kaKholbhethi, uHeck noJohnson bacabanga ukushicilela okwakuzolingisa ngokubhuqa izindaba… ngo-1988. Kusukela ekusungulweni kwayo, iThe Onion ibe uhlelo olulingisa izindaba olukhulu olunokwethenjelwa…"" This directly identifies The Onion as the news source founded by the UW students.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: The Colbert Report** and **C: The Daily Show** are mentioned as programs *influenced* by The Onion's writers, not the source itself.
*   **B: The Electoral College** is a topic *mentioned* in an Onion story, not a news source."
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungafakiwe ohlelweni olulingisa izindaba olukhulu lwe-The Onion?","The correct answer is **B: Ifilimu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions the following as parts of The Onion's operation:

*   **Izindaba ezishicilelwayo** (printed stories)
*   **Iwebusayithi** (website)
*   **Incwadi yamabalazwe** (atlas - ""Our Dumb World"")
*   Izikhangiso zomuntu siqu
*   Inethiwekhi yezindaba yamahora angu-24
*   Ama-podcast

The text does **not** mention anything about The Onion producing a **ifilimu**.

Therefore, **ifilimu** is the only option not included in the description of The Onion's activities."
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyayigadwe amaphoyisa?","The correct answer is **C: Indawo yokungena eseDowning Street**.

The text states: ""Ukubhikisha kulaqe cishe ngo-11:00 isikhathi sendawo (UTC+1) eWhitehall ebhekene nendawo yokungena eDowning Street egadwe amaphoyisa..."" which translates to ""The protest began around 11:00 local time (UTC+1) in Whitehall facing the Downing Street entrance guarded by police...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ITrafalgar Square:** The protestors *passed through* Trafalgar Square, but it wasn’t what was guarded by police at the beginning of the protest.
*   **B: ISpring Forum:** This was the destination of the protestors, not the location that was guarded.
*   **D: Ihotela iGrand Connaught Rooms:**  This is where the Spring Forum was held, not what was guarded."
Amaphoyisa abacela ngobani isikhathi ababhikisi ukuba baqhele ukuze kugwemeke ukwakheka kwesiminyaminya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngo-11:20**.

The text states: ""Ngo-11:20, amaphoyisa acele ababhikishi ukuthi bahlehlele endaweni yabahamba ngezinyawo, bethi kudingeka balinganisele phakathi kwelungelo lokubhikisha kanye nesiminyaminya esakhekayo."" This directly translates to ""At 11:20, police asked protesters to move to the pedestrian area, saying they needed to balance the right to protest and the developing congestion."""
Yini eyiqiniso ngokuphathelene nocwaningo olwenziwa uDkt. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Amanye amagundane ayekade enoshukela awasenawo manje**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"""Manje sinamagundane anezinyanga ezingu-4 angenawo ushukela ayenoshukela,"""" wanezela. 

This directly translates to: ""Now we have mice that have been without sugar for 4 months who had sugar,"" he added. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text explicitly states Dr. Ur *doubts* diabetes can be *cured*.
*   **C:** Dr. Ur is cautious and acknowledges the research is preliminary. He doesn't express hope for a cure.
*   **D:** The text speaks about mice *having* sugar then *not* having it, not about mice that *never* had sugar.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini uDkt. Ur amanqikanqika ngayo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthi lokho akutholile kuzobasiza yini abantu abanoHlobo 1 lukashukela** (Whether what he found will help people with Type 1 diabetes).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Njengezinye izazi, unokungabaza ngokuthi isifo sikashukela singalashwa, ephawula ukuthi lokhu okutholakele akubathinti abantu abanoHlobo 1 lukashukela.""  This translates to: ""Like other experts, he doubts whether diabetes can be cured, noting that this finding doesn't affect people with Type 1 diabetes."" 

This clearly indicates Dr. Ur is questioning whether the research will have any benefit for those with Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uma ikhambi likhona** (If a cure exists) - While he doubts a *cure* exists, his specific concern is about Type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: Okungakhethwa abanye ochwepheshe mayelana nekhambi** (What other experts disagree about regarding a cure) - The text doesn't focus on disagreements, but on his doubt *and* the specific lack of impact on Type 1 diabetics.
*   **D: Uma amagundane angenawo ushukela engahlala enjalo** (If the sugar-free mice remain that way) - This refers to the research itself, not Dr. Ur's skepticism about its application.



"
Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezingakuchazi ngokunembile lokho okwenzeka ngesikhathi kuphahlazeka indiza CG4684?,"The correct answer is **B: Indiza yaphahlazeka endaweni ekude.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Indawo yokuphahlazeka itholwe namuhla futhi akufinyeleleki kuyo..."" This directly indicates the plane crashed in a remote, inaccessible location.
*   **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    *   **A: Ekuqaleni indiza ayikwazanga ukuhlala phansi ngenxa yesimo sezulu** - The passage states bad weather *may* have contributed to the crash, but it doesn't say the initial approach was unsuccessful due to weather. It says it disappeared on its second approach.
    *   **C: Indiza yazama ukuhlala phansi izikhathi ezintathu ngaphambi kokuphahlazeka** - The passage only mentions a second approach; there’s no mention of a third.
    *   **D: Indawo okwakufunwa kuyo indiza ephahlazekile yathintwa isimo sezulu** - While the weather is bad, the passage doesn't state the crash site *was affected* by the weather - just that the weather is a possible cause of the crash.



"
Yini eyabangela ukuba iNdiza CG4684 ukuba ingahlali phansi?,"The correct answer is **D: Isimo sezulu sasisibi**.

The text states that ""bad weather, the same that caused the original plane crash, is suspected"" as a contributing factor to the disappearance. While the landing location being inaccessible is a consequence, the *cause* is believed to be the bad weather.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indawo yokuhlala yayingafinyeleleki** - This is a result of the situation, not the cause.
*   **B: Kwakunezinye izindiza ezazingaphambi kwendiza engu-CG4684** - The text does not mention anything about other aircraft.
*   **C: Indiza yachezukiselwa eKokoda** - The text does not indicate the plane crashed *at* Kokoda, only that it was flying *to* Kokoda. It says the crash site was discovered today.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo ezingelona iqiniso mayelana nalokho uFranciszek Kowal abhekana nakho?","The correct answer is **A: Wakwazi ukuphihliza ifasitela**.

Here's why:

The text states Franciszek Kowal *saw* people trying to break windows to escape. It doesn't say he personally broke a window.  The text states “Elilodwa lamafasitela laphuka ekugcineni, futhi baqala ukuphuma ngamafasitela”, indicating *others* broke the window and escaped.

Let's look at why the other options are potentially true based on the text:

* **B: Waphuma enganamyocu** - The text says people were desperately trying to escape (""ukuphuma""), implying they were likely attempting to escape without waiting for help.
* **C: Waphula isitulo ngesikhathi ezama ukuphuma** - The text says “Abantu babeshaya izingilazi ngezihlalo”, so it's possible he was part of that group.
* **D: Walimala ngesikhathi ezama ukuphihliza ifasitela** - The situation was chaotic and dangerous (""isenzakalo esisabisayo""), making it plausible he was injured.



"
Kungani kuyinselele ukukala umonakalo ongabangelwa iSiphepho uDanielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Kusekude kuqale ukuwa kwesiphepho** (It is too far to tell where the hurricane will make landfall).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Isiphepho sikude nogu, kusenzima ukubona ithuba lokuthi sigadle eMelika noma e-Caribbean."" This directly translates to ""The hurricane is far from land, making it difficult to see where it will make landfall in America or the Caribbean."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubikezelwa ukuthi lesi siphepho sizoba namandla kakhulu** (The hurricane is predicted to be strong) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* it's hard to assess damage. A strong storm doesn't inherently make damage assessment difficult; it's the uncertainty of its path.
*   **B: Ososayensi abaqiniseki ngezivunguvungu eziqhubekayo** (Scientists are unsure about ongoing hurricanes) - The passage states scientists *do* have a prediction (it will strengthen), so this is incorrect.
*   **D: Isiphepho sibikwa ukuthi sikude kuneMiami** (The hurricane is reported to be far from Miami) - This is a factual statement from the passage, but it doesn't explain the difficulty in assessing potential damage. It simply states its location.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yiziphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana neSiphepho uDanielle esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Siseduzane nezwe**.

Here's why:

*   The text states Danielle is ""approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida"". This clearly indicates it is *not* near land.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true according to the text:

*   **A: Umonakalo esizowubangela eCaribbean asaziwa** - The text says it's difficult to tell if it will hit the US or Caribbean, implying potential (unknown) damage.
*   **B: Sakhandeka Olwandle lwase-Atlantic** - The text states it ""developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean"".
*   **C: Futhi singaphenduka isiphepho** - The text says scientists ""forecast Danielle will strengthen into a hurricane."" This means it *can* become a hurricane (a stronger type of storm).

"Ngokwendaba, yini okusikiselwa ukuba yenziwe ngesifo gnaphambi kokuba siphenduke ubhubhane oluthinta umhlaba wonke?","The correct answer is **B: Izimpawu kudingeka ukuba zingabi nzima kakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Olunye ucwaningo lukhombisa ukuthi lesi sifo kumelwe sibe nengozi yokubangela ukufa encane ngaphambi kokuthi sidale ubhubhane lomhlaba..."" and ""Kunokukhathazeka kokuthi iziguli zingathelela abantu abaningi ngokuqhubeka nokuphila kwazo kwansuku zonke uma izimpawu zomkhuhlane zihlala zingezimbi.""  This directly implies that for the virus to spread and cause a pandemic, it needs to be relatively mild in its symptoms so people continue their normal lives and unknowingly spread it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kufanele lungabi ingozi kakhulu** - While related, the passage focuses more on the *severity of symptoms* as the key factor in spreading, not just overall danger.
*   **C: Abantu abaningi kudingeka bachaphazeleke** - The passage doesn't say a large number of people *need* to be affected initially, just that mild symptoms allow for continued spread.
*   **D: Izingake kudingeka zibe nezimpawu** - The passage specifically mentions the concern that people are spreading it *even with mild symptoms*, so the virus doesn't need to be asymptomatic.



"
"Ngokwendaba, sasiqhele kangakanani isishingishane neFujian?","The correct answer is **D: Amakhilomitha angu-77**.

The passage states the typhoon Morakot was ""amakhilomitha angamashumi ayisikhombisakude"" (77 kilometers) from Fujian province."
Ubani owabingelela uGeorge W. Bush ngesikhathi efika e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: UWong Kan Seng kanye noHsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Wabingelelwa iPhini likaNdunankulu uWong Kan Seng futhi waxoxa ngezinkinga zezentengiselwano kanye nezokuvakasha kanye noNdunankulu waseSingapore uLee Hsien Loong."" This means both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong welcomed President Bush.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ungqongqoshe** - The passage doesn't say a Minister welcomed him, it specifically names the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister.
*   **B: Izilaleli** - Bush addressed an audience *after* the meetings, not upon arrival.
*   **D: Isekela likaNgqongqoshe** - While Wong Kan Seng is the Deputy Prime Minister, the passage also mentions the Prime Minister.



"
Umengameli wakhuluma nini ngokwandiswa kwezohwebo e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulandela kokuhlulwa okhethweni oluphakathi nesikhathi sokubusa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngemva kweviki lokulahlekelwa okhethweni lwaphakathi nesikhathi, uBhush watshela izilaleli ngokukhulisa ezentengiselwano e-Asia."" This directly translates to ""Following the mid-term election loss, Bush spoke to audiences about growing trade in Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngaphambi kokuba afike eSingapore** - The text does not say he spoke about trade *before* arriving.
*   **B: Kanye noWong Kan Seng** - While he discussed trade *with* Wong Kan Seng, the text doesn't say he specifically spoke *about expanding* trade during that meeting.
*   **D: Phakathi nalo lonke isonto lokuvakashela e-Asia** - The text points to a specific moment *after* the election, not throughout the whole trip."
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwumgomo oyinhloko kahulumeni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukususa umthwalo emakalishini agcwele kakhulu** (To relieve the burden on the most crowded prisons).

Here's why:

* The passage states the goal is to reduce *overcrowding* (""ukuncishiswe ukubutheleka"").  Adding more prison staff (the 1300 total) is a *means* to achieve that goal, not the goal itself. The goal is to alleviate the pressure on overcrowded prisons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukusiza amakalishi amaingi ngoMashi walo nyaka** (To help more prisons in March of this year) - This is just a mention of *when* the commitment was made, not the goal.
* **B: Ukuthola amakalishi angu-300** (To obtain 300 prisons) - The passage says they're obtaining *staff*, not prisons.
* **C: Ukuthola amakalishi engeziwe angu-1,300** (To obtain an additional 1300 prisons) - Again, it's *staff*, not prisons, and obtaining the staff is a way to solve the overcrowding issue, not the goal itself.



"
Yini eyamenyezelwa uhulumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwahlelwa ukuba kusizwe amakalishi engeziwe angu-300**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the announcement concerns the government's commitment to support ""inkalishi"" (presumably meaning 'police' or 'officers' in this context) and that an *additional* 300 will be added, bringing the total to 1,300.  This directly translates to more officers being supported.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention revealing problems. It focuses on support.
* **C:** While the total *eventually* reaches 1,300, the announcement is specifically about the *additional* 300.
* **D:** The announcement is *about* the support, not that the problem will be fixed in March. The commitment was made in March.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi ukwaziswa okwaziwayo?","The correct answer is **A: Izinga lokusongela seliye lancishiswa** (The level of threat has been reduced).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Ayikho imibiko esikisela ukuthi ukuhlaselwa kumelwe kulindelwe maduzane."" (There are no reports suggesting an attack should be expected soon.)  This directly implies the threat level is down.
* **P also states:** ""...ukuncishiswa kwezinga losongo ukuthi libe libi akusho ukuthi usongo oluphelele alusekho."" (However, the reduction of the threat level to be bad does not mean the complete threat is gone.) This confirms a *reduction* in the threat, not its complete elimination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Abusekho ubungozi** (There is no danger) -  P explicitly says the threat isn't *completely* gone.
* **C: Kulindeleke ukuba kube nokuhlasela** (An attack is expected) - P says the opposite – no reports suggest an imminent attack.
* **D: Iqembu elisebenza ngezezempi liqinisekisile ukuthi ukuhlasela kuzoba nzima** (The military group has confirmed that the attack will be difficult) - This information isn’t in the passage.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nemibhikisho esingelona iqiniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ikhomishani kamengameli yaphendula mayelana nababhikishi (The presidential commission responded about the protesters)**.

Here's why:

The text states the presidential commission *recommended* the resignation of the CEP, but it doesn’t say they *responded to* the protesters. The protests were a reaction to the lack of elections and the government’s handling of the situation, not a direct response *from* the commission *to* the protesters themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **B: Ukudlulelwa isikhathi kokhetho kwasusa umsindo kubabhikishi (The delay of the elections fueled the protesters):** The text explicitly says the protests stemmed from the failure to hold elections that were due since 2011.
*   **C: Ababhikishi babefuna ukuba kwesule iCEP yangaphambili (The protesters wanted the previous CEP to resign):** The text states the commission recommended the CEP's resignation as part of steps to hold elections, which implicitly addresses the protesters' desires.
*   **D: Ubhikisho lwalubuye lube nodlame (The protest was also violent):** The text says “Ukubhikisha okuba nodlame ngezinye izikhathi (The protest was violent at times)”.



"
Ubani owasikisela ukuba iCEP yokugcina yesule?,"The correct answer is **A: UMartelly**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""UMartelly ufungiise i-Provisional Electora Council(CEP) entsha enamalunga ayisishiyagalolunye izolo."" This directly translates to ""Martelly appointed a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.""  Therefore, Martelly is the one who initiated the replacement of the CEP."
"Ngokwesitatimende, yini engasekelwa Abezokuzivocavoca base-USA kulandela ukuhlukunyezwa kwabadlali yiNassar?","The correct answer is **C: Ushintsho oludingekile ngaphakathi kwenhlangano**.

Here's why:

The statement specifically says: ""I-USA Gymnastics isekela uphenyo oluzimele olungaveza ukukhanya endleleni ukuhlukumeza kobukhulu obuchazwe ngesibindi yilabo abasinde kuLarry Nassar obekungenzeka kungabonwa ngayo isikhathi eside kangaka futhi yamukela noma izinguquko ezidingekayo nezifanele."" (USA Gymnastics supports independent investigations to shed light on the extent of the abuse described by the Larry Nassar survivors that could have gone unnoticed for so long and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.)

While they *also* support independent investigation (D), the statement highlights a willingness to make internal changes within the organization as a response to the abuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukunganeliseki (Dissatisfaction)** - While implied, it's not the core action they are taking.
*   **B: Ukusungula indawo enamandla (Establishing a safe place)** - They support a safe environment for athletes *generally*, but this isn’t what they are explicitly supporting in response to the Nassar situation.
*   **D: Ucwaningo oluzimele (Independent investigation)** - They support this, but the bigger point is that they'll act on whatever the investigation finds and make changes internally.



"
"Ngokwesitatimende, yimuphi umgomo oyinhloko kokubili Abezokuzivocavoca base-USA kanye Nekomiti Lama-Olympic Ase-United States njengoba isikhathi siqhubeka?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwenza kube nendawo ephephile yabadlali** (To make a safe environment for athletes).

Here's why:

The statement explicitly says both USA Gymnastics and the USOC share a goal of ""making the sport of gymnastics, and all sports, as safe as possible so athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, healthy, and empowering environment."" This is the overarching aim they both express.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukucacisa ukuhlukunyezwa kukaLarry Nassar** (Clarifying Larry Nassar's abuse) - While acknowledging the abuse is important, the statement focuses on preventing future abuse, not just clarifying past events.
*   **B: Ukulwela indaba yokunganeliseki** (Advocating for accountability) - Accountability is a *means* to the end of safety, but not the goal itself.
*   **C: Ukulandelela ucwaningo oluzimele** (Pursuing independent research) - Research is a tool to *achieve* safety, not the ultimate goal.



"
Umkhumbi wawuphokophele kuphi lapho kwenzeka ingozi? ,"The correct answer is **C: EPalawan**.

Here's why:

The text states the ship was ""on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan"" when the incident occurred. This indicates Palawan is the location where the grounding happened.



"
Yini engelona iqiniso mayelana nomkhumbi okukhulunywe ngawo endabeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Wawusekelwe ePalawan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship was *en route to* Puerto Princesa in Palawan, meaning it was *traveling towards* Palawan, not based there.
*   The other options are directly supported by the text:
    *   **A:** The text clearly states it was ""en route to Puerto Princesa.""
    *   **C:** It is described as a ""mine countermeasures ship.""
    *   **D:** It's stated to be assigned to the U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet.



"
Ubani owethula isitatimende mayelana nebutho lase-US?,"The correct answer is **D: Unobhala wabezindaba**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Isitatimende esikhishwe unobhala wephephandaba..."" (The statement was released by the press secretary).  While Donald Trump *made* the announcement, it was communicated *through* his press secretary.
"
"Mayelana nesitatimende, yiliphi izwe elacabanga ukuthi linomthwalo wokuqapha abalwi ababethunjiwe?","The correct answer is **B: IYurophu**.

The text states: ""...amazwe waseYurophu anqabe ukuwalanda."" which translates to ""...European countries refused to take them."" This means European countries were considered for the responsibility of guarding the captured ISIS fighters but declined.
"
Kukholakala sengathi yaba yini imbangela yokuphahlazeka?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo onamandla** (Heavy fire).

The passage states: ""…kukholelwa ukuthi kubekhona ngenxa **yomlilo onamandla**."" (…it is believed to be due to **heavy fire**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isimo sezwe esiqinile** (Strong national condition) - This isn't mentioned as a cause.
*   **C: Indawo enezintaba** (Mountainous area) - While the area is mountainous, it's stated the crash is *believed* to be *because of* fire, not just the location.
*   **D: Isimo sezulu esibi** (Bad weather) - Bad weather is hindering the *search* for the wreckage, not causing the crash itself.



"
Ingozi yenzeka kuluphi uhlobo lwesimo?,"The correct answer is **D: Enezintaba** (Mountainous).

The passage specifically states: ""Ukuphahlazeka kwenzeke phezulu **endaweni enezintaba**..."" (The crash occurred high in **the mountainous area**...).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Esibi kakhulu** (Very bad) - Describes the *situation* but not the *location*.
*   **B: Esinzima** (Difficult) - Describes the *conditions* for the search, not the location.
*   **C: Umfelandawonye** (Peaceful countryside) - The passage suggests the opposite of a peaceful countryside.



"
Iziphathimandla zithembe ini ngenxa yezikhukhula?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukufakwa kwenhlabathi emasakeni** (Sediment deposition).

Here's why:

The passage states that the dams stopped the seasonal floods which *distributed sediment throughout the river*. This sediment was essential for creating sandbars and shoals, habitats for wildlife. The authorities hope that even a small increase in water levels after the releases will be enough to *rebuild the aging sandbars downstream*. This rebuilding is essentially sediment deposition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukwakhiwa kwamabhishi** (Building of dams) - The passage talks about the *effects* of a dam already being built, not building more.
*   **C: Ukwanda kwesibalo sohlobo oluthile lukafishi onegquma** (Increase in the number of a particular species of fish with a hump) - The passage highlights the *decline* of fish populations, especially the humpback chub.
*   **D: Izindawo ezengeziwe zokuhlala kwezilwane zasendle** (More habitat for wildlife) - While this is the *goal*, it's not what the authorities directly hope will happen. They hope the sediment deposition will *lead to* more habitat.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwathinta ngokuphelele ukwakhiwa kwedamu?,"The correct answer is **C: Indawo yokuhlala izilwane zasendle**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage directly states** that the dams prevented the spread of sediment which was *needed for creating sandbars and shoals, which functioned as habitat for native wildlife*. The entire problem described revolves around the impact on animal habitats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izingxobo zesihlabathi (Earth dams)** - While the passage mentions a dam was built, the question is about what was *affected* by the dam, not the dam itself.
*   **B: Uhlobo oluthile lukafishi onegquma (A specific type of humpback fish)** - The humpback chub is *affected* by the problem, it isn't what the dam directly impacted.
*   **D: Ukusabalala kohlobo oluthile lwamatshe (The spread of a certain type of rock)** - The passage discusses sediment (sand and silt), not specific rocks.

"Ngokwendaba, ubani owanikeza i-United States ulwazi mayelana nokuhlasela okungase kwenzeke?","The correct answer is **C: Umthombo ongadalulwanga** (An unnamed source).

The passage specifically states: ""IMelika ithi ithole ukwaziswa **emthonjweni ongadalulwanga** lowo..."" (America says it received information from an **unnamed source**...).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ontamolukhuni baseSomalia** - The passage mentions ""abeqisi base-Somalia"" as *potential attackers*, not as the source of the information.
*   **B: Amanxusa ase-Ethiopia** - Ethiopia is mentioned as a potential target, not as the source of the information.
*   **D: Umthombo oseKenya** - Kenya is mentioned as a potential target, not as the source of the information."
Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo eziluchaza ngokunembile uhlelo lontamolukhuni lokuba bahlasele?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqhumisa amabhomu ezindaweni ezinkulu emazweni amabili**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** The warning is about attacks in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia (""...ukuqhumisa 'izindawo ezivelele' eTopiya kanye naseKenya"").
* **""Izindawo ezivelele""** translates to ""prominent locations"" which implies larger, important areas. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Too broad - doesn't specify the countries.
* **B:** Correct about the number of countries, but doesn't mention the type of locations.
* **D:** Only mentions one country, which is incorrect according to the text.



"
Ubani kulaba abalandelayo ongeyena ummeli?,"The correct answer is **D: UMakis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   **USakis Kechagioglou** is identified as a lawyer (""Abameli bamaGreki"").
*   **UGeorge Nikolakopoulos** is also identified as a lawyer (""Abameli bamaGreki"").
*   **UPetros Mantouvalos** is explicitly stated to be a member of Parliament *and* a lawyer (""ilungu lePhalamende nommeli"").
*   **UMakis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a journalist (""intatheli""). He presents a TV show but is not mentioned as having any legal qualifications.



"
Yiliphi iqembu labantu elingabaliwe njengeliyingxenye yesenzo esiyihlazo phakathi nomphakathi ongokomthetho wamaGreek?,"The correct answer is **A: Abezomthetho**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the outcry from the Greek legal community (implied by ""emphakathini ongokomthetho wamaGriki"") was due to the misconduct of ""abahluleli, izazi zomthetho, abasizi babameli kanye nabameli abazenzile."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amajaji** - While a high-ranking judge *was* convicted, the outrage included a broader range of legal professionals.
*   **C: Izintatheli** - A journalist (*uMakis Triantafylopoulos*) brought information forward, but wasn't part of the wrongdoing itself.
*   **D: Abameli** - While representatives (and self-proclaimed representatives) were involved, the outrage encompassed all legal professionals.

Therefore, ""abezomthetho"" (legal professionals) is the most encompassing and correct answer."
I-India yalahlekelwa ama-wicket amangaki?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The text states: ""Kodwa, ngemva kokuba kukhiswhe ukaputeni wayo, iNdiya yenze amaphuzu angu-36 kuphela ilahlekelwa amawikhethi angu-7 kuze kube sekugcineni kwengxenye yomdlalo."" (But, after losing its captain, India scored only 36 runs losing 7 wickets till the end of the innings.)"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ayethini amaphuzu aphakeme kulowo mdlalo?","The correct answer is **C: ama-run angu-100**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid had a partnership of 100 runs. While Uthappa scored the highest individual innings (70 runs), the partnership of 100 is the highest *combined* score mentioned in the passage. The other options refer to individual scores or the team's total in a later, less successful part of the game."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeyona imbangela yokukhungatheka kuka-Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Umthetho omusha engosini mayelana nezinto zocansi** (The new law in the jurisdiction regarding pornography).

Here's why:

The passage states Adam Cuerden is upset about:

*   Wales portraying the removal as being for legal reasons (implying Wales lied).
*   Wales claiming to have listened to him, then removing his art.
*   The removal of his art itself.

The new law is mentioned as a *result* of the public outcry caused by the situation, not as a reason for Cuerden's original distress. Therefore, it is not a cause of *his* frustration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukususwa kobuciko baseWales** (The removal of Wales' art) - This is directly stated as a source of Cuerden's unhappiness.
*   **C: Ukungalalelwa yiWales** (Wales not listening) - Cuerden felt Wales pretended to listen but then removed his work.
*   **D: Amanga mayelana nembangela yokususwa kobuciko** (Lies about the reason for removing the art) - Cuerden explicitly states Wales ""basically lied from the start"" about the legal reasons for the removal.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini eyasuswa kule ngosi?","The correct answer is **A: Ubuciko (Artwork)**.

The passage states: ""...kuze kube sekususweni kobuciko bakhe"" - ""...until the removal of his art."" This directly answers the question of what was removed.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasekelwa u-Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **B: Izimbangi zaseBrithani**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngaphezu kokuphawula kwakhe uthe uzosekela abaqophisana nabase-British emidlalweni yama-Olempikhi ayebanjelwa e-London ngo-2012."" This directly translates to ""Despite his comment, he said he would support contenders and the British in the Olympic games held in London in 2012.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Okuhlanganisa abalwayo babesifazane kwezama-Olympic** - The text explicitly states he *doesn't* support women fighting.
*   **C: Okungakhethwa abesifazane** - The passage doesn't mention anything about excluding women.
*   **D: Ukuzingatha ama-Olympic eLondon** - He supports *participants* in the London Olympics, not the event itself.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo u-Amir Khan azokweseka naphezu kwalokho yena angase akukhethe?","The correct answer is **C: Ama-Olympic ango-2012**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Ngaphezu kokuphawula kwakhe uthe uzosekela abaqophisana nabase-British emidlalweni yama-Olempikhi ayebanjelwa e-London ngo-2012.""  This directly translates to ""Despite his comment, he said he would support the competitors and the British in the Olympic Games held in London in 2012.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abalwi babesifazane (Female fighters):** He explicitly stated he *doesn't* think women should fight.
*   **B: Izimbangi zakhe zama-Olympic ango-2004 (His Olympic rivals from 2004):** The text doesn't mention anything about supporting his rivals.
*   **D: Abanye abathola izindondo zesiliva (Other silver medalists):**  The text only mentions his own medal and doesn't discuss supporting other silver medalists.



"
Washona nini uPeter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: Esibhedlela**. 

Here's why:

The text states that Peter Lenz was ""taken to a local hospital where he died."" While he crashed during practice and was initially treated by track medics, he ultimately passed away *at the hospital*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phakathi nesikhathi sokuzivocavoca:** He crashed during practice, but didn't die *during* that time.
*   **B: Ngemva kokuwa ebhayisikilini:** He crashed after falling off the bike, but didn't die at the crash site.
*   **D: Ngesikhathi esendaweni yokudlala ekanye nabezokwelapha:** He was treated by medics, but died later in the hospital.



"
Ubani uXavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Omunye wabagijimi** (One of the racers).

Here's why:

The text states ""and was struck by a competitor, also Xavier Zayat."" This clearly indicates Zayat is another racer involved in the accident. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided in the text."
Kukusiphi isimo lapho oshayela izindiza engazuza ekuqondeni ukusebenza kwangaphakathi kwendiza?,"The correct answer is **B: Ekwesabeni kwabo ukundiza ukuthi kumayelana nokwesaba into engaziwa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that understanding how a plane works and what happens during flight can help people overcome fear based on *the unknown* or a lack of control.  Option B directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While understanding the plane might *help* someone anxious, the passage doesn't say the pilot benefits from the passenger's understanding.
*   **C:** The passage focuses on fear of flying, not a general fear of all transportation.
*   **D:** The passage focuses on fears *related* to flying, not trauma from unrelated events.

"Mayelana nale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo umuntu ohambayo okhathazeka ngamanani okufanele akhathazeke ngakho ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuqhathanisa amanani phakathi kwezinkampani eziningi zezokuthutha** (Comparing prices between many transport companies).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the same flight can have significantly different prices depending on where you look. It highlights the *benefit* of comparing search results and checking the airline's website directly.  This directly points to the importance of comparing prices across multiple airlines.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukubheka izinto ezinikezwa izinkampani zezokuthutha eziningi** (Looking at offers from many transport companies) – While this is related, the passage focuses specifically on *price* comparison, not just looking at what's offered.
* **B: Ukubhuka ngokuqondile nenkampani yamabhanoyi** (Booking directly with the airline) – The passage actually suggests checking the airline's website *after* comparing, implying direct booking isn't always the cheapest.
* **D: Ukubheka iwebusayithi yamabhanoyo** (Checking the airline's website) –  Again, the passage recommends this *in addition to* comparison shopping, not as a standalone strategy.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umuntu othatha uhambo okufanele ayenze kuqala ukuze athole amanani amahle endiza?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuqhathanisa amanani phakathi kwezinkampani ezahlukahlukene ezikoleka imininingwane bese zenza ama-link** (Comparing prices between different companies that collect information and make links).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that prices can vary significantly for the same flight and that it's beneficial to **compare search results** and check the airline's website directly. Option B directly reflects this advice – using a service that compares prices from different sources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukubheka iwebusayithi yamabhanoyo** (Checking the airline's website) - The passage says to do this *after* comparing, not as the first step.
*   **C: Ukubhukha ngokuqondile enkampanini yezamabhanoyi** (Booking directly with the airline) - The passage implies this might *not* get you the best price.
*   **D: Ukubhukha ngokuqondile ne-ejenti** (Booking directly with an agent) - The passage doesn't mention travel agents.



"
Kunini lapho umngane kudingeka aphelezele ohambisa izinto?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho izinto zithunyelwa njengemithwalo okuzodingeka ukuba ihlolwe** (When items are shipped as freight that needs to be inspected).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The easiest way to get it in quickly is to ship it as an inspected load."" and ""Airline regulations won’t allow them to ship freight without a passenger, which is where you come in.""  This directly links the need for someone to accompany the shipment to the fact that it's being shipped as freight requiring inspection.  A ""freight forwarder"" (the person accompanying the shipment) is needed to ensure it gets through the inspection process quickly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lapho izinto zithunyelwa ngendiza** (When items are shipped by plane) - While the items *are* shipped by plane, it's the *type* of shipment (inspected freight) that necessitates an escort, not just plane travel in general.
* **B: Lapho inkampani isebenzisa ezayo izindiza** (When the company uses its own planes) -  The passage states this is for larger companies and doesn’t need a person accompanying the shipment.
* **D: Lapho okuthunyelwayo kuzosingathwa inkampani enkulu** (When the shipment will be handled by a large company) -  The size of the receiving company isn't the determining factor.

"Ngokusekelwe kule ndaba, lapho kukhethwa Ozoshayela Njalo Indiza yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo okufanele zibe semqoka?","The correct answer is **D: Inkampani yezindiza engase yengeze amalungelo engeziwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that benefits *vary* and that the same amount of money could yield different benefits with different airlines. This implies that choosing an airline shouldn't just be based on frequency (C) or size (B), but on which airline offers the *best potential benefits* – including the possibility of adding extra perks.  While more points (A) is good, the passage highlights that benefits are variable, meaning points aren't the only factor.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase anikeze amaphuzu okundiza amaningi?","The correct answer is **C: Inkampani yezindiza ovame ukuhamba ngayo ngaphansi komfelandawonye ohlukile**.

Here's why:

The passage states that different airlines *within the same frequent flyer program* can offer varying benefits for the same amount of money. Therefore, the airline you frequently fly *within a different alliance* is most likely to give you more flight points.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A & D:** The passage focuses on benefits *within* a program, not necessarily across different programs.
*   **B:** If you fly the same airline under the same program, the points structure is likely to be consistent (and less advantageous compared to exploring alternatives).



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izinzwa ezilandelayo ezingalimala ngokuphuza kakhulu utshwala?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuzwa (Hearing)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to ""ukulimala kwesibindi kanye nobumpumputhe nokufa"" (liver damage and blindness/death). While the passage doesn't directly mention hearing, blindness is a loss of sight (a sense).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukubona (Sight):** The passage *does* mention blindness as a potential consequence of excessive drinking, making this a plausible answer.
*   **C: Ukunambitha (Taste):** The passage doesn't mention taste.
*   **D: Ukuhogela (Smell):** The passage doesn't mention smell.

**Therefore, based on the information provided, the best answer is A: Ukuzwa because it aligns with the mention of blindness.**



"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, yini enganciphisa ukulinyazwa utshwala?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuphuza utshwala ngezinga elifanele** (Drinking alcohol in moderation).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Phuza iziphuzo ezidakayo ngokulinganisela"" (Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation) and emphasizes knowing your limits.  It highlights that excessive drinking leads to health problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuphuza utshwala kanye ne-methanol** (Drinking alcohol and methanol) - Methanol is *dangerous* and causes blindness or death, it doesn't *reduce* harm.
* **B: Ukuphuza utshwala obunamandla obuwumkhiqizo ongekho emthethweni** (Drinking strong alcohol that is an illegal product) - The passage warns against illegal alcohol because of dangerous, unknown ingredients like methanol.
* **D: Ukuphuza nabantu abahlukahlukene** (Drinking with different people) -  This doesn't relate to reducing the harms of alcohol.



"
Yikuphi lapho emakhulu khona amanani ezindlu phakathi ne-Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: EsiGodini saseCanal**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...amanani wezindlu aphakathi kwamanye aphezulu ezweni"" *within* the Canal District. The other options aren't directly supported by the text.
"
Kungani isiGodi saseCanal sibekwe eNdaweni Yase-UNESCO World Heritage?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunamagugu ezomlando namasiko** (It has historical and cultural value).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the Canal District was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""ngenxa yesiko layo elihlukile negugu elingokomlando"" (because of its unique culture and historical value). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Izindlu zakhona ezehlukile** (The houses there are unique) - While true, this is a *result* of the historical and cultural significance, not the reason *why* it's a UNESCO site.
*   **C: Indawo yakhona ezungeze iBinnenstad** (The area is around the Binnenstad) - This describes the location, not the reason for its UNESCO status.
*   **D: Izindawo ezinamanani aphakeme** (Areas with high prices) - High property values are a consequence of its desirability, not the reason it was recognized by UNESCO."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwenza ukuvakashela iPhnom Krom kube okwanelisayo?","The correct answer is **A: Indlela ebukeka ngayo indawo yaseTonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isimo sokungabi nathemba sethempeli kanye **nokubona indawo ngaphezu kwechibi leTonle Sap** kwenza ukugibela igqube kufanelwe umzamo."" (The hopeless state of the temple and **the view of the area over the Tonle Sap lake** makes climbing the hill worthwhile). This directly links the view of Tonle Sap as a reason to visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuvakasha kulo lonke elase-Angkor Pass** - While the Angkor Pass is *required* for entry, it doesn't make the visit specifically worthwhile, it just allows you to enter.
*   **C: Ukubona iSiem Reap** - Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, but the passage doesn't mention seeing Siem Reap as a reason to visit Phnom Krom.
*   **D: Ukuhamba ngesikebhe edamini** - The passage suggests a boat trip *to* the lake can be combined with the visit, but the boat ride itself isn't why the visit is worthwhile.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini edingeka ezivakashini ukuze zingene ePhnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuthola i-Angkor Pass**.

The text states: ""Indawo Yokudlula yase-Angkor iyadingeka ukuze ungene ethempelini ngakho ungakhohlwa ukuza nephasiphothi yakho uma uya eTonle Sap."" This means an Angkor Pass is required for entry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuqwala udlule ithempeli iYasovarman** - The text mentions the temple was built during Yasovarman's reign, but doesn't say you need to ""pass"" it.
*   **B: Ukuhamba ngaseSiem Reap** - The text states Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but doesn't say you need to travel *from* there.
*   **D: Ukuhamba ngesikebhe ukuzungeza i-Tonle Sap** - While a boat trip to the lake is suggested as a combined activity, it's not a requirement for *entering* Phnom Krom."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungavimbel izivakashi ukuba zivakashele i-Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Izindleko ezinkulu zokuhamba** (The high cost of travel).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ukuvakasha kwezivakashi kuyabiza..."" which translates to ""Visiting Antarctica is expensive..."". This directly states cost as a barrier to visiting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isithakazelo sokubona uLwandle LwaseRoss** (Interest in seeing the Ross Sea) - The passage mentions the Ross Sea, but not as a deterrent to visitors.
* **C: Uhlelo lokusebenza oluvumela izivakashi ngoDisemba nangoJanuwari** (An application allowing visitors in December and January) - The passage states visits are *only* possible in the summer (November to February), so an app wouldn't change this.
* **D: Ukungabi khona kwezinto zokuhamba** (The lack of transportation) - The passage mentions air travel *does* happen for professionals, so transportation isn't entirely absent.



"
Isivakashi esinesithakazelo ezintabeni singavakashela yiphi ingxenye yase-Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Indawo emaphakathi nezwe (The interior)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kwezinye izikhathi ukuvakasha kwasemoyeni kochwephesha kuya phakathi nezwe, ukugibela izintaba noma ukufinyelela kuyiPole, enesiqu esikhulu.""  This directly links mountain climbing/exploration to the *interior* of Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ULwandle LwaseRoss (Ross Sea):** The text mentions this area is heavily regulated.
*   **C: Indawo eyinhlonhlo (The Antarctic Peninsula):**  Also heavily regulated.
*   **D: Indawo eyisiqhingi (The Ice Sheet):** While Antarctica *is* covered in ice, this doesn't specifically mention access for mountain climbing.



"
Ijwayele ukuba kuphi indawo yasendulo yokubuka?,"The correct answer is **A: Endaweni engeneka kalula** (In an easily accessible location).

Here's why:

The passage states that ancient viewing spots are ""easily found in towns or schools"" because light pollution wasn't a concern back then. This implies they were built in convenient, accessible locations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Enkabeni yedolobha** (In the city center) - While possible, the passage doesn’t specifically highlight city centers.
*   **C: Endaweni ecezile** (In a remote area) - The passage says they are *easily* found, which contradicts the idea of a remote location.
*   **D: Ekolishi** (At a college) - While some might be at colleges, the passage broadly mentions ""schools"" which include more than just colleges.



"
Zijwayele ukubekwa kuphi izipopolo zokucwaninga zesimanje?,"The correct answer is **A: Emuyuziyamu (In museums)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...zihlala kumamyuziyamu, noma izindawo zokufundisa"" which translates to ""...they usually end up in museums, or educational locations.""  This directly supports the idea that older artifacts are commonly found in museums.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Enyuvesi (At universities):** While some artifacts might be at universities for research, the passage doesn't emphasize this.
* **C: Endaweni yokufunda (In an educational location):** This is too broad – museums *are* educational locations, but the passage specifically highlights museums.
* **D: Esakhiweni esikhulu (In a large building):**  This is far too general and doesn't relate to the passage's focus on preservation and display.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo ethule ukuze ujabulele usuku ebhishi?","The correct answer is **A: ESt Heliers**.

Here's why:

The text states that Tamaki Drive beaches (including St Heliers and Mission Bay) are in the Waitemata Harbour and are family beaches with shops and safe swimming.  However, it specifically mentions that these beaches ""can get crowded"" (implying they *aren't* always quiet). 

While Mission Bay is mentioned, the text doesn't differentiate it as being more or less quiet than St Heliers. The North Harbour District and Waitemata Harbour are broader locations, not specific beaches described as places to enjoy a day.

Therefore, based on the information given, **St Heliers** is the most likely place to enjoy a quieter day at the beach."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izimo zasendaweni yokubhukuda ezibonakala siphephile?","The correct answer is **A: EDevonport**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Kucishe kube izingu ezinesihlabathi eziyindawo ephephile yokubhukuda..."" regarding the beaches in the North Harbor District, specifically mentioning Devonport as a location within that district.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ENorth Harbor District:** While the passage mentions the North Harbor District, it doesn't specifically say *the entire district* is a safe swimming area, only beaches *within* it.
*   **C: ECentral Auckland:** The passage describes beaches in Central Auckland (Tamaki Drive), but specifically states they are safe for swimming.
*   **D: ELong Bay:** Long Bay is mentioned as a starting point for ferries but the passage doesn't specifically say it is a safe swimming beach.



"
"Ngesikhathi uvakashele indawo okukhulunywa ngayo kule ndaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungabonakala kungafaneleki?","The correct answer is **C: Ukwenza amahlaya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Musa ukungcolisa isiza ngokuphawula noma ukwenza imifanekiso esodongeni ezakhiweni."" and ""Musa ukwenzi amahlaya ngokuQothulwa kwesizwe noma ama-Nazi"". Making jokes is disrespectful and violates the instructions to treat the site with solemnity and respect.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly prohibited, although still generally disrespectful:

*   **A: Ukwenza izenzo ezinesizotha:** While the text stresses ""isizotha"" (humility), simply acting respectfully isn't inherently *wrong*. It's what you *do* while being respectful that matters.
*   **B: Ukushiya umaka endaweni ethile kwenye yezindawo:** This is disrespectful and considered vandalism.
*   **D: Ukunweba isakhiwo:** This is destructive and clearly inappropriate.

Therefore, making jokes is the most directly prohibited action mentioned in the text."
Yikuphi kulokhu okuchaza kahle ulimi lokuxhumana?,"The correct answer is **C: Okwakhiwe** (Constructed).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Izilimi zesikhashana ... ezakhiwe ngenhloso yokulungiselela ukukhulumisana..."" (Temporary languages... constructed with the purpose of preparing communication...)
* **A language of communication (lingua franca) is *specifically* created or adopted to facilitate understanding between groups who don't share a native language.**  It's not naturally occurring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Okwenziwayo (Functional):** While a lingua franca *is* functional, the passage emphasizes *how* it achieves that function – by being constructed.
* **B: Okungekho ngokwemvelo (Unnatural):** This is true, but ""constructed"" is a more precise description from the passage.
* **D: Okuphilayo (Living):** Lingua francas aren't typically ""living"" languages in the sense of having native speakers and evolving organically. They are often simplified or adapted versions of existing languages, or completely new creations.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende esingazichazi ngokunembile izilimi ezisizayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunezilimi ezingokwemvelo ezisetshenziswayo ukuxhumana nabantu okungenzeka abakwazi ukuqonda lokho omunye akushoyo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage defines auxiliary languages as *constructed* languages (or artificial) designed to aid communication *when natural languages present a barrier*.** Option A describes natural languages used to attempt communication where understanding is difficult - this is the problem auxiliary languages *solve*, not what they *are*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Kunezilimi ezingokwemvelo kanti ezinye zakhiwe:**  The passage explicitly states auxiliary languages can be *either* natural (main) languages *or* constructed.
* **C: Kunezilimi ezakhiwe ukuze kuthuthukiswe izindlela zokuxhumana:** This accurately describes the *purpose* of auxiliary languages as defined in the passage.
* **D: Kunezilimi ezenziwe ezikhonyayo phakathi kwezikhulumi zezilimi ezingafani:**  This describes the *function* of auxiliary languages – they bridge the gap between speakers of different languages.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umgibeli okufanele ayibheke emkhumbini uma kuhanjewa ebusika?","The correct answer is **B: Izimfuneko ze-Visa**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kulindelwe ukuthi abahamba ngomkhumbi bahlangabezane nezimfuneko ze-visa (hlola imigomo)"" which translates to ""Passengers are expected to meet visa requirements (check the terms)"".  The passage highlights the importance of verifying visa regulations for the cruise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuthi indawo ozolala kuyo ikuphi** - While relevant to a cruise, the passage doesn't focus on cabin location.
*   **C: Imigomo** - The passage refers to ""terms"" *related to* the visa, not as the primary thing to check.
*   **D: Isikhathi esizochithwa edolobheni** - The passage mentions the city is included in the cruise but doesn't emphasize the length of stay.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uma umkhumbi uhamba ehlobo, yini okufuneka bakwazi ukuyigwema?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhamba eqhweni**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""traveling on deck causes discomfort in the joints for those most affected"" in the North Baltic region due to the area's unique climate.  This means travelers should avoid being on deck.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isikhathi edolobheni** - The passage mentions the city is included in the cruise, but doesn't suggest avoiding it.
*   **C: Izimfuneko ze-Visa** - The passage says travelers *need* to meet visa requirements, not avoid them.
*   **D: ISaint Petersburg** - Saint Petersburg is a destination on the cruise; there's no reason to avoid it."
Kungani isiCatalan sivame ukusetshenziswa ezimpawini nasezazisweni zaseBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ulimi lokuqala olusemthethweni lwedolobha**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""However, Catalan is also legally established as the first official language."" This explains why signage and official notices are primarily in Catalan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iqondakala kalula kuneSipnishi** - The text doesn't mention anything about ease of understanding between the two languages.
*   **C: Ulimi olukhethwayo eBarcelona** - While many prefer Catalan, the text highlights its *legal* status as the reason for its use.
*   **D: IMetro kanye nezakhiwo zomphakathi zisetshenziswa njalo ngabantu abakhuluma isiCatalan** - This isn't mentioned in the provided text; the use of Catalan is linked to its legal status, not necessarily who uses the infrastructure.



"
Yiziphi kulezi zilimi ezilandelayo ezisetshenziswa uhlelo lwaseBarcelona iMetro ekwenzeni izaziso?,"The correct answer is **C: IsiPenishi**.

Here's why:

The text states that *unplanned disruptions* are announced by the system in multiple languages *including* Spanish (IsiPenishi). While Catalan is used for regular announcements, Spanish is specifically mentioned as being part of the machine translation for disruptions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: IsiNgisi:** IsiNgisi is mentioned as one of the languages used, but it's not the main focus of the information.
*   **B: IsiCatalan:** IsiCatalan is used for regular announcements, not the disruption announcements the question refers to.
*   **D: IsiFulentshi:** IsiFulentshi is mentioned as one of the languages used, but it's not the main focus of the information.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izinto kulezi ezilandelayo ongase ungazitholi ezindaweni zokulala eziphezulu?","The correct answer is **D: I-inthanethi esheshayo (Fast internet)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *traditional* and *luxurious* aspects of high-end B&Bs. It highlights handmade quilts, antique beds, local seasonal food, historic buildings, and well-maintained gardens.  These places aim for a specific aesthetic and experience rooted in quality and local charm.

Fast internet is a modern convenience that doesn't fit with the described atmosphere. The passage doesn't mention anything about modern amenities like that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izinto ezikhethekile ezisohlwini lokudliwayo (Special items on the menu)** - The passage specifically mentions special breakfasts.
*   **B: Izinto zasendlini zakudala eziyikhethelo (Unique antique items)** - The passage mentions antique beds and buildings with antiques.
*   **C: Izindawo zangaphandle ezinakekelwa kahle (Well-maintained outdoor spaces)** -  The passage mentions beautifully landscaped gardens.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi kulezi zinto ezilandelayo ezingelona iphuzu elisemqoka lomncintiswano wezindawo zokulala zomntakabani?","The correct answer is **A: Impahla yokuhlobisa evamile (Generic decor)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on what sets *high-end* B&Bs apart.  It highlights unique and special features like handmade quilts, antique beds, local seasonal food, and historic buildings with amenities like pools.  ""Generic decor"" doesn't contribute to this level of competition; in fact, the passage implies that B&Bs strive to *avoid* being generic.

Let's look at why the other options *are* important based on the text:

* **B: Ukudla kwasekuseni okuhlukahlukene (Varied breakfast):** The passage specifically mentions ""delicious seasonal local food"" or a ""specialty chef's breakfast"" as a key competitive point.
* **C: Izinto zombhede ezisezingeni eliphezulu (High-quality bedding):** It explicitly mentions ""comfortable accommodation, perhaps a handmade quilt or an antique bed.""
* **D: Ukudla neziphuzo ezithathwe endaweni (Locally sourced food and drink):** This is covered under the emphasis on ""delicious seasonal local food"".

"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kuze kubanjelwe eBeijing ngo-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Indawo yemicimbi iTaizicheng yokutshuza eqhweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some skiing events will be held at the Taizicheng skiing venue *in Zhangjiakou*, which is 220km from Beijing.  It doesn't say these events will be held *in* Beijing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imicimbi yokuvula (Opening Ceremonies):** The passage specifically says Beijing will host the opening ceremonies.
*   **C: Imicimbi yokuvala (Closing Ceremonies):** The passage specifically says Beijing will host the closing ceremonies.
*   **D: Izenzakalo ezenzeka endaweni eneqhwa engaphakathi (Indoor ice sports events):** The passage says Beijing will host indoor ice sports.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuzobanjelwa eBeijing ngo-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Izenzakalo ezenzeka endaweni eneqhwa engaphakathi**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""I-Beijing izobungaza imicimbi yokuvula neyokuvala kanye nemidlalo yeqhwa yangaphakathi."" (Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as indoor ice sports.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imiqhudelwano yasehlobo (Summer competitions):** The passage is about the *Winter* Olympics.
*   **C: Imiqhudelwano yasebusika (Winter competitions):** While the games *are* the Winter Olympics, the passage clarifies that *some* winter events are in Zhangjiakou, not all in Beijing.
*   **D: Ukuvala imicimbi (Closing events):** While Beijing *will* host the closing ceremonies, the question asks what will be held in Beijing, not just one specific event. The indoor ice sports are the broader category.



"
Obani abasengcupheni enkulu yokuthola umkhuhlane wezinyoni?,"The correct answer is **C: Abantu abasebenza ngezinkukhu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Abaningi bahlanganisa abantu abasebenza ngezinkukhu, kodwa zikhona nezingozi kubabheki bezinyoni."" (Many cases involve people working with chickens, but there are also risks to bird watchers). While bird watchers are at risk, the passage highlights those working with chickens as being *more* frequently affected.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Abantu abathanda ukubuka izinyoni (People who like to watch birds):** The passage mentions them as being at risk, but not the primary group.
*   **B: Abantu abasebenza ngezilwane ezincelisayo (People who work with livestock):** The passage specifically mentions chickens, making this a broader and less precise answer.
*   **D: Abantu asebeke batheleleka (People who have already been infected):** This option refers to people who are *already* sick, not who are at the highest risk of *getting* sick.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwuchaza ngokunembile umkhuhlane wezinyoni?","The correct answer is **C: Abantu abathanda ukubuka izinyoni basengcupheni yokutheleleka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...zikhona nezingozi kubabheki bezinyoni."" (There are also risks for bird watchers). This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abasebenza ngezinkukhu kuphela abathole umkhuhlane** - The passage says ""Abaningi bahlanganisa abantu abasebenza ngezinkukhu, *kodwa* zikhona nezingozi kubabheki bezinyoni."" (Many associate it with people who work with chickens, *but* there are risks for bird watchers) – it's not *only* chicken workers.
* **B: Kutholakale ukuthi abantu abagula kakhulu kunezinyoni** - The passage doesn't compare the number of cases in humans vs. birds.
* **D: Bonke abantu abathelelekile bashonile** - The passage states that *some* cases have been fatal, not all.  It says ""...kodwa okunye kwakho bekubulala."" (but some of them have been fatal).

Umfula i-White Sea–Baltic Canal uxhumanisa ini nani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ulwandle i-Arctic noLwandle iBaltic**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ulwandle oluMhlophe–Umsele i-Baltic luhlanganisa uLwandlekazi i-Arctic noLwandle i-Baltic..."" which translates to ""The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...""

"Ngokwale ndaba, amaphasiphothi athathwa ohlotsheni lwezimoto ezinjani ukuze abagibeli bangaphazamiseki?","The correct answer is **B: Izitimela okwazi ukulala kuzo ebusuku** (Trains where you can sleep overnight).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Kulezi zitimela okulalwa kuzo, iphasiphothi ingathathwa ukhondakta ukwenzela ukuthi ungaphazamiseki uma sewulele.""  This directly translates to ""On these trains where you can sleep, your passport can be taken by the conductor so you aren't disturbed when you are sleeping.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amabhanoyi** (Buses) - The text doesn't mention buses.
*   **C: Imikhumbi** (Ships) - While passports are checked at ports, the text doesn't say passports are *taken* on ships for sleeping purposes.
*   **D: Izitimela ezeqa umgcele** (Trains crossing the border) - The text mentions border trains get passport checks *during travel*, not that the passports are held by the conductor for the duration of the journey.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yinini lapho umazisi wakho engahlolwa khona kwezinye izitimela ezeqa umngcele?","The correct answer is **D: Esitimeleni esigijimayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kwezinye izitimela eziya emazweni angomakhelwane ukuhlolwa kwenziwa **esitimeleni esihambayo** futhi kumelwe uphathe nomazisi ongokomthetho uma ugibela esinye salezo zitimela.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngemva kokusuka esitimeleni** - The passage doesn't mention inspection *after* exiting the train.
*   **B: Lapho ulele** - While the passage mentions passports can be taken for safekeeping while sleeping, it doesn't say this is *when* they are checked.
*   **C: Ngeke ihlolwe** - The passage explicitly states that identification is required and inspections *are* done on some trains."
Iziphi kulezi zinkinga ezilandelayo engase iphakame lapho usezindaweni ezisemahlathini zaseSingapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukushiselwa kakhulu (Excessive heat)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that being in the ""upper countries with high heat"" (referring to forested areas) in Singapore means you'll face heat (constantly) and strong sun.  The other options are not mentioned as problems in the text:

*   **A: Ukubanjwa inkunzi (Being bitten by mosquitoes)** - Not mentioned.
*   **B: Lapho izitolo zingekho (Where there are no stores)** - The passage says you can buy anything *after arriving* in Singapore, implying availability, not a lack of stores.
*   **D: Ukuduka (Getting lost)** - Not mentioned.



"
Obani okungase kudingeke ukuba bagweme ukudla izinto ezenziwe ngofulawa zaseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **A: Umuntu oguliswa amakinati (A person with nut allergies)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that German baked goods *often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts*.  Someone with a nut allergy would need to avoid these foods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Umuntu othanda idizethi enokhilimu (A person who likes creamy desserts)** - The passage describes rich, flavorful baked goods which someone who likes creamy desserts would likely enjoy.
*   **C: Umuntu ongawuthandi ushokholethi (A person who doesn't like chocolate)** - The passage doesn't mention chocolate, so this isn't relevant.
*   **D: Umuntu othanda izinto ezinoshukela kunezimuncu (A person who prefers sweet things to savory)** - The passage describes fruit-filled and often sweet baked goods, which would appeal to someone who prefers sweets.



"
Yisiphi isithako esibhekwa njengesivela ngenkathi ethile yaseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **C: Amapulamusi**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...kanye nama-cherry namapulamu evela ngehlobo."" (and cherries and plums are available in summer). This indicates plums are a seasonal ingredient in German baking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ama-apula (Apples):** While apples are used year-round, they aren't described as being *seasonal*.
*   **B: Amantongomane (Nuts):** Nuts, generally, aren't tied to a specific season in the text.
*   **D: Ama-alimondi (Almonds):** Almonds are mentioned as a common ingredient but not as seasonal.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kukhuthazwe esilinganisweni semali yokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **C: Ukucela abantu imali** (Begging people for money).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that responsible, low-cost travelers *do not* ""coerce people in any way to benefit themselves."" Begging falls directly under this description. The passage emphasizes ethical travel and earning money through work, or reducing expenses through careful planning – not relying on the generosity (or being a burden) of others.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Ukuthola umsebenzi ongafamile phakathi nokuvakasha** (Finding odd jobs while traveling) - The passage mentions ""working along the way"" as a valid way to reduce costs.
*   **B: Ukuzivumelanisa nezimo ezingeni lakho elithokomele** (Adapting to less comfortable conditions) - The passage states those willing to forgo comfort can find very cheap travel options.
*   **D: Ukunciphisa imali ozoyisebenzisela ukudla nokulala** (Reducing spending on food and lodging) - This is a direct example of ""balancing your costs"" as mentioned in the passage.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase abe nesikhathi esinzima sokuvakasha ngemali encane kakhulu?","The correct answer is **A: Umuntu ozilethela izinkinga**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the advice assumes travelers **don't** engage in illegal or unethical behavior like stealing, scamming, or exploiting others.  Someone who is prone to causing trouble is likely to resort to these things to travel cheaply, which the article explicitly discourages. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umuntu ongakwazi ukuzibamba uma kuziwa ekuchitheni isikhathi** - The text mentions sacrificing comfort and predictability, implying patience is helpful, not a hindrance.
* **C: Umuntu ohlela ukusebenza lapho ekhona kuyilapho evakashile** - This is actually a *good* way to travel cheaply (the text mentions working *during* travel as one of the two main categories).
* **D: Umuntu ojabulela ukulandela uhambo** - Enjoying spontaneity is not a problem for the type of traveler the article describes.



"
Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende esingakuchazi ngokunembile ukushayela phakathi nePoint Marion kanye neFairmont?,"The correct answer is **D: Inethiwekhi yamaselula akufanele ibe inkinga**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""Surprisingly, however, cell phone service is *very strong* here..."" This directly contradicts the idea that the cellular network would be a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

*   **A: Kunebanga elide lendawo engenalutho emgwaqweni** - The text says the road ""passes through stretches of remote woodland.""
*   **B: Olayini bancane emgwaqweni** - The passage mentions ""tight curves"" and ""bad turns.""
*   **C: Akulula ukulalela isivinini esiphakeme** - The text states speed limits are low (35-40 mph) and vigilance is key, implying slower, careful driving.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okufanele kube inkinga kubashayeli abahamba kuthela wayeka waseBuffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **C: Ukujika kungazelelwe** (Unexpected curves).

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions ""izindlela eziwungcingo, kanye namajika amabi agcwele"" (winding roads and tight curves) as a difficulty for drivers unfamiliar with rural roads.  The passage strongly advises drivers to be alert because of these curves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukubanjwa isiminyaminya** (Being caught in darkness): While driving through forests can be darker, the text doesn’t highlight darkness as a major problem.
*   **B: Ukungabikhona kwenethiwekhi yamaselula** (Lack of cellular network): The text actually states the *opposite* – that cell service is surprisingly *strong* in this area.
*   **D: Ukuhlale uhlangana nabasebenza emgwaqweni** (Constantly encountering road workers): The text does not mention road workers.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungadingi ukuba uqale umdlalo wokugxuma ezintabeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Isimo esisendaweni ephezulu**.

Here's why:

The text states that canyoneering requires ""little to no fitness or athletic background to get started."" This directly contradicts the need for a high level of physical fitness (isimo esisendaweni ephezulu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikhono lokubhukuda (Swimming ability):** The text explicitly mentions swimming as part of canyoneering (""includes features of swimming"").
*   **C: Ukukwazi ukugxuma (Jumping ability):** The text mentions jumping as part of canyoneering (""jumping"").
*   **D: Ukuqeqeshwa kancane (Little training):** The text states that canyoneering needs ""little training.""



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kudingeke lapho kuvakashelwa izindawo okugxunywa kuzo ezintabeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Amakhono okubhukuda** (Swimming skills).

Here's why:

The passage states that i-canyoning (canyoneering) involves features like *swimming*. While it doesn't require extensive training, it implies basic swimming ability is needed. The other options are either too broad (A), require more significant training (C), or are only *one* element of the activity (B - while there's water, it's not just about diving).

Therefore, having swimming skills is the most directly supported requirement based on the provided text."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaba usizo kumuntu ohlela ukulala emotweni yakhe?","The correct answer is **B: Imoto ekwazi ukuvumela izitulo ukuba zilale** (A car that allows the seats to lay flat).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""Ukukanisa emotweni kungenzeka lapho uneveni encane, i-SUV, iSedan noma iStation Wagon esinezihlalo ezikwazi ukulala."" (Car camping is possible when you have a van, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon with seats that can lay flat).  This directly links the ability to sleep in a car to having seats that can recline or fold down flat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuqonda okujulile kokulinganiselwa kwemoto** (A deep understanding of your car's maneuverability) - While knowing your car is good, it doesn't help you *sleep* in it.
*   **C: Ithende** (A tent) - The passage contrasts car camping with setting up a tent and suggests camping in the car is a simpler option.
*   **D: Indawo yakho endaweni yokukhempa** (Your spot in a campground) - This doesn't relate to the ability to sleep *in* the car, but to the location of camping in general.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini abantu abakhempa ngezimoto abangafuna ukuyigwema uma befuna ukungalahleki?","The correct answer is **C: Ukumisa amatende edolobheni noma endaweni yomuntu** (Setting up tents in towns or on someone's property).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukumisa itende endaweni enomnikazi noma edolobheni lanoma ibuphi ubukhulu kungabanga ukunakwa okungafunwa."" (Setting up a tent on someone's property or in any sized town is unlikely to receive unwanted attention).  This implies it's something to *avoid* if you're trying to be discreet or not noticed. The passage is discussing car camping as a way to avoid traditional camping (and the attention it might bring).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukushayela izimoto ezinkulu, njengamaSUV noma amatekisi** (Driving large vehicles, like SUVs or trucks): The passage actually acknowledges people *can* car camp in these, it's just that smaller cars are easier to maneuver and more familiar to the driver.
*   **B: Ukuthatha uhambo olude kakhulu emgwaqweni** (Taking a very long trip on the road): The passage states that road trips are exactly *what* people are doing when car camping.
*   **D: Ukungabi nalo ulwazi olunzulu lwemoto abahamba ngayo** (Not having a deep knowledge of the vehicle they are traveling in): The passage says people are *familiar* with their own cars, which is a benefit of car camping.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani owaphinde wakha iCasablanca okwesibili?","The correct answer is **A: AmaPutukezi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""AmaPutukezi alichitha futhi alakha kabusha ngaphansi kwegama leCAsa Branca, ukuze nje aliyeke dengwane ngemva kokuzamazama komhlaba ngo-1755."" This directly indicates the Portuguese rebuilt Casablanca after destroying it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Abahwebi baseSpain:** While Spanish traders *named* the city Casablanca, they didn't rebuild it from scratch.
*   **C: Abantu baseMerenid:** The Merenids used Anfa (the original name of the site) as a port, but didn't rebuild the city as such.
*   **D: Indawo yomlando yaseMorocco:** This is too general. While the Moroccan ruler later rebuilt it as Daru l-Badya, it was the Portuguese who did the *second* rebuilding after its destruction."
Ubani owalahla idolobha lesimanje laseCassablanca ngemva kwenhlekelele yemvelo?,"The correct answer is **B: AmaPutukezi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""AmaPutukezi alichitha futhi alakha kabusha ngaphansi kwegama leCAsa Branca, ukuze nje aliyeke dengwane ngemva kokuzamazama komhlaba ngo-1755."" This directly translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.""



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iSintra yakuthola kanjani ukuqashelwa abantu bakwamanye amazwe?","The correct answer is **C: Imibiko emihle yeLord Byron**.

The passage explicitly states that Sintra became famous internationally ""after its beautiful history of splendor was written by Lord Byron."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ICabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is a location *near* Sintra, accessible by bus, but it isn't what made Sintra famous.
* **B: Izimpawu zeMarian:** These relate to Fatima, not Sintra.
* **D: Umlando wayo ongokothando:** While the passage mentions Sintra is romantic and fascinating, it doesn’t say this is *why* it gained international recognition. Lord Byron's writings are specifically credited with that.



"
Yini engaqashelwa abantu base-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **A: Isifunda saseNagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

The text states that the region of Nagorno-Karabakh (populated by Armenians) declared independence but ""no country recognized it legally - not even Armenia."" This means the thing *not* being recognized is the region itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Impi eyalwiwa ne-Azeris:**  The war is a *cause* of the issue, but not what's being unrecognised.
* **C: Izinxabano zamanxusa ase-Azerbaijan:** The text doesn't focus on internal Azerbaijani disputes.
* **D: Irepublic entsha:** This is a result of the Armenian uprising, but it's the *region* the republic claims that isn't recognized.



"
Yini eyaqhubeka nokuthinta ubudlelwane obuphakathi kwe-Azerbaijan ne-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Izinxabano zamanxusa**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Izimpikiswano zezifundiswa phakathi kwesifunda ziyaqhubeka zilimaza ubudlelwane phakathi kwe-Armenia kanye ne-Azerbaijan"" which translates to ""Disputes between intellectuals within the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan"".  This directly identifies the ongoing intellectual/political disagreements as the factor impacting the relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ama-Armenia ahlala e-Azerbaijan (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** While Armenians living in Azerbaijan is *part* of the background, the passage doesn't say their presence *continues* to damage the relationship.
*   **B: Impi yango-1994 (The 1994 war):**  The war *caused* the initial damage, but the passage says disputes *continue* to damage the relationship, implying something ongoing.
*   **D: Isifunda saseNagorno-Karabakh (The Nagorno-Karabakh region):**  The region is the *source* of the conflict, but the passage points to the continued disagreements *about* the region as the damaging factor.



"
"Njengoba ugibela itekisi eCharlotte, yini engakwenza ukhokhe imali eyengeziwe?","The correct answer is **B: Ukugibela nibathathu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kunenhlawuliso engaphezulu yokuba nabagibeli abangaphezu kuka-2, ngakho lokhu ongakukhetha kungaba okubiza kakhulu kunalokho okudingekayo."" This directly means there's an extra charge for having more than 2 passengers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuhlala kwenye indawo** - The passage doesn't mention extra costs based on location.
*   **C: Ukuya enhla nedolobha** - The passage doesn't mention extra costs based on destination within Charlotte.
*   **D: Ukuba nomndeni onengane** - While the passage mentions Charlotte being family-friendly, it doesn't say there's an extra charge for travelling with children.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engabhekelwa phansi ngokuhlala nezingane eCharlotte?","The correct answer is **B: Ukugibela itekisi (Taking a taxi)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Amatekisi awavamisanga ukusetshenziswa imindeni eCharlotte, ngisho noma engaba usizo kwezinye izimo. Kunenhlawuliso engaphezulu yokuba nabagibeli abangaphezu kuka-2, ngakho lokhu ongakukhetha kungaba okubiza kakhulu kunalokho okudingekayo.""  This means taxis are discouraged due to cost when traveling with families.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amanani ezindawo zokuhlala (Housing costs):** The passage says Charlotte has *many* high-quality options for families, implying availability, not necessarily affordability being a problem.
* **C: Abahlali ababuya kwezinye izindawo (Out-of-state residents):** The passage states residents *choose* Charlotte because it's family-friendly - this isn't a drawback.
* **D: Ukuzama ukujabulela idolobha (Trying to enjoy the city):**  The passage says visitors find it *easy* to enjoy the city with children, so this isn’t a negative.



"
"Ngaphambi kokufika eSpain, ubani oqondisa ingxenye engenhla yaseChile?","The correct answer is **D: Ama-Incas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the Araucanian natives (Mapuche) inhabited central and southern Chile.""

Therefore, the Incas ruled the northern part of Chile before the Spanish arrived.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kwenzeke ngo-1810?","The correct answer is **B: IChile yanqoba abaseSpain**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Chile declared independence in 1810, *but* didn't fully defeat the Spanish until 1818. Therefore, Chile could not have conquered the Spanish in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yayingekho inkaba kahulumeni:** The passage states the Spanish government was left without a central government for a few years due to the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **C: Impi yeNapoleon yaliwa:** The passage mentions the Napoleonic Wars were happening *during* Chile's declaration of independence.
*   **D: IChile yamemezela ukuthi isizimele:** The passage specifically states Chile declared its independence in 1810.



"
Abantu bangafinyelela kanjani esigodini esicezile esisesifundeni saseLiguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngesitimela noma ngesikebhe** (By train or by boat).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izindlela, izitimela kanye nezikebhe kuxhumanisa amadolobhana, futhi izimoto azikwazi ukuwafinyelela kusuka ngaphandle."" (Trails, trains and boats connect the towns, and cars cannot reach them from outside.)

Therefore, you can only access Cinque Terre by train or boat, not by car.



"
Libhekisela kuphi igama lesiNtaliyane elithi ‘Cinque Terre?,"The correct answer is **A: Izigodi ezinhlanu**.

Here's why:

* **Cinque Terre** literally translates from Italian to ""Five Lands"". ""Terre"" means lands or territories. While it's not directly ""valleys"", in the context of the landscape described (steep slopes and coastal areas), 'lands' can be interpreted as the unique, carved-out areas/valleys where the towns are built.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwamabhuzu esifanele izindawo ezinokushibilika ezimweni zasebusika?","The correct answer is **B: Amabhuzu anesoli enezinto zokubambelela** (Boots with soles containing grip material).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Amanye amabhuzu anezinto ezicijile futhi kezinto ezicijile ezifakwayo zezimo ezishelelayo, ezifaneleke izicathulo namabhuzu, ezezithende noma izithende namasoli."" This directly translates to ""Some boots have studded materials and these studded materials are for slippery conditions, suitable for shoes and boots, with treads or soles with studs.""  This implies that studs/grip material on the soles are beneficial for icy conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amabhuzu anezithende ezincane** (Boots with small treads) - While treads are good, the text emphasizes *grip material* specifically for slippery conditions. Small treads alone may not be enough.
* **C: Amabhuzu anezithende ezinde** (Boots with long treads) - The text mentions the need for treads to be *wide* and *downwards*, not necessarily long.
* **D: Amabhuzu angenakho ukujula kwephethini yesoli engamayintshi angu1/5** (Boots without a sole pattern depth of 1/5 inch) -  The text explicitly states the pattern should be *at least* 5mm (1/5 inch) deep, making this option the opposite of what's recommended.



"
Yini engeke ikusize uhambe kahle emgwaqweni oneqhwa phakathi nezimo zezulu zasebusika?,"The correct answer is **D: Amanzi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that salt (calcium chloride), soil, and sand are *used* to improve grip on icy roads. It doesn't say water helps. In fact, water *creates* ice, making the road *more* slippery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Usawoti (Salt)** - The passage explicitly states salt is used to improve grip.
*   **B: Ubhuqu (Sand)** - The passage explicitly states sand is used to improve grip.
*   **C: Inhlabathi (Soil)** - The passage explicitly states soil is used to improve grip.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwukufana okunembile phakathi kweHawaii kanye neSiqhingi iCook?,"The correct answer is **C: Basebenzisa isikhathi esifanayo**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngesikhathi sendawo esifana nesaseHawaii, iziqhingi ngezinye izikhathi zithathwa """"njengeziseHawaii""""."" This directly translates to ""During times like Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as 'like Hawaii'."" This means they share a similar climate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zombili lezi zindawo zinamahhotela amakhulu** - The passage specifically states the Cook Islands *don't* have large tourist hotels, unlike Hawaii before it was developed.
*   **B: Zombili lezi zindawo azinabo ubuzwe** - The passage does not mention whether Hawaii has sovereignty.
*   **D: Zombili lezi zindawo azinawo amadolobha** - The passage states the Cook Islands don't have cities, but doesn't say the same about Hawaii.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi ngokunembile iSiqhingi iCook?,"The correct answer is **C: Amadolobha ayinhloko yiRarotonga ne-Aitutaki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""IziQhingi zaseCook azinawo noma imaphi amadolobha kodwa zenziwe yiziqhingi ezingu-15 ezihlukahlukene. Eziyinhloko iRarotong kanye ne-Aitutaki."" This directly contradicts the statement that Rarotonga and Aitutaki are *cities*. They are the *main islands* – not cities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Incane kuneHawaii** - The passage says it's smaller than Hawaii (""Noma iyincane, ikhumbuza izivakashi ezikhulile i-Hawaii..."")
*   **B: Iyiqoqo leziqhingi** - The passage explicitly states it is (""Yidlanzana leziqhingi elineziqhingi ezingu-15..."")
*   **D: Indawo eyisiqhingi ihlanganyela isikhathi esifanayo njengeHawaii** - The passage says, ""Ngesikhathi sendawo esifana nesaseHawaii..."""
Iyiphi indawo kulezi ezilandelayo zokuhlala ezisehlathini ezinikeza izinhlobo ezimbili ongazikhetha zokuhlala?,"The correct answer is **A: ESirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ISirena yiso kuphela isiteshi sabanakekeli bamahlathi esinezindawo zokulala zamakamelo alala abantu abaningi nokudla okushisayo ngaphezu kokukanisa."" (ESirena is the only ranger station with both dorm-style lodging and hot food in addition to camping).

The other options only offer camping:

*   ILos Patos, I-La Leona, and ISan Pedrillo zihlinzeka ngokukanisa kuphela ngaphandle kwezinkonzo zokudla. (ILos Patos, La Leona, and San Pedrillo only provide camping without food services)."
"Ngokwale ndaba, ungayilondoloza kuphi imvume yokupaka uma ufuna ukusebenzisa imali engukheshi kunokusebenzisa ikhadi lezikweletu?","The correct answer is **B: EPuerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kuyenzeka ukuthola izimvume zepaki ngokuqondile Esiteshi Somphathi Wendawo ePuerto Jiménez..."" This directly says you can get permits at the local ranger station in Puerto Jiménez. It also notes that the Park Service (MINAE) doesn’t issue permits so close to the arrival date, and CafeNet El Sol charges a fee for booking. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ESirena:** Sirena provides lodging, not permit issuing.
*   **C: ECafeNet El Sol:** CafeNet El Sol charges a *booking fee* but doesn’t issue the permits themselves.
*   **D: I-La Leona:** La Leona only offers camping and doesn't provide permit services.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lokutshuza olwenziwa ezindaweni ezenyukelayo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuqwala iqhwa (Snowshoeing)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""Cabanga ngendlela yokushushuluza eqhweni njengendlela efanayo yokuqwala izintaba."" and defines ""ukushushuluza eqhweni"" as relating to mountain travel. While it distinguishes it from alpine mountaineering, it is still a form of travel *on snow*. Thus, snowshoeing is the most accurate description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuqwala endaweni engagadiwe (Hiking in undeveloped areas)**: While snowshoeing can *occur* in undeveloped areas, it specifically refers to travel *on snow*, not just undeveloped land.
*   **C: Ukuqwala intaba (Mountain climbing)**: The text clarifies that snowshoeing is *different* from alpine mountaineering, which is a more technical form of mountain climbing.
*   **D: Ukuhamba eqhweni utete ubhakha (Backcountry skiing)**: The text doesn't mention skiing, and focuses on traveling with snowshoes (""isikhwama"").



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engasiza abashushuluza eqhweni emaphandleni uma befuna ukuhamba ngesivinini esiphezulu?","The correct answer is **C: Ezimweni ezinhle**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ezimweni ezinhle uzokwazi ukuhamba cishe ibanga elide kunokuhamba ngezinyawo – kodwa ngokwethukela okukhulu kuphela ungathola isivinini sokushushuluza eqhweni ezindaweni ezingajwayelekile ngaphandle kwesikhwama esisindayo emizileni elungisiwe.""  This directly links good conditions to achieving high speed in snowshoeing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izicathulo eziqinile:** While good footwear is important, the text doesn't specifically say they help with *speed*.
*   **B: Isikhwama esisindayo:** The text explicitly states high speed is achieved *without* a heavy backpack.
*   **D: Emizileni elungisiwe:** The text states that speed can be achieved in unmarked terrain *without* a heavy bag, but does not specifically mention groomed trails.



"
Abathatha abahambo bahlabezana nokwethuka kokuphinde bangene banesikhathi esinzima sokwenzani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuphinde uzivumelanise nesiko lasekhaya (Re-adjusting to their home culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that travelers often find it *harder* to readjust to their own culture after being away. They've gotten used to a new culture and then need to re-learn and adapt to their original one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuzivumelanisa namasikho endawo entsha (Adjusting to a new culture):** The passage says this is *easier* for travelers initially.
*   **B: Ukba nesineke nokuqonda (Having patience and understanding):** While important, the passage focuses on the *difficulty* of re-adjustment, not the need for patience *from others* when returning home.
*   **C: Ukuvakashela phesheya (Traveling abroad):** This is the *cause* of the problem, not the thing people struggle with upon return.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuthuswa ukubuya kungase kube nzima ngokukhethekile kumuntu ovakashile onjani?","The correct answer is **B: Abahambi abasheshe bazivumelanise nempilo yakwelinye izwe**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that travelers who *easily* adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their own. This is because they've become accustomed to a different way of life and may struggle with the re-adaptation process back home.  The passage explains that the shock of returning home can be greater because people don't expect the same patience and understanding when *returning* that they would offer a first-time visitor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abahambi ababhekane nokuthuka okuthile ngenxa yesiko** - While culture shock is mentioned, the passage focuses on those who *didn't* initially struggle much.
*   **C: Abahambi abasesesikhathi sokuncebeleka ngezothando** -  Romantic involvements aren't discussed in the passage.
*   **D: Abahambi abangenaso isikhathi sokuba nesineke** - The passage highlights a lack of *expected* patience from others towards returnees, not necessarily the traveler's own patience.



"
Yini elandelayo abantu okufanele bagweme ukuyenza nge-moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukusondela kuyo kancane**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people can put themselves in danger by getting too close to moose if they don't perceive them as a threat. This directly implies that **approaching them closely** is something to avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukungakunaki ukuba khona kwayo** - Ignoring a moose's presence could lead to accidentally getting too close.
*   **C: Ukunciphisa izinga lobungozi bayo** - Underestimating the danger is what the passage warns against.
*   **D: Ukuyibuka ukude** - Observing from a distance is *safe* and doesn't contradict the passage.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esingelona iqiniso nge-moose?","The correct answer is **A: Iyisilwane esinolaka (It is an aggressive animal)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that moose *don't* like violence (""azithandi udlame""). They only defend themselves when they perceive a threat.  The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **B:** The passage says people may not see them as dangerous.
*   **C:**  The passage warns people can put themselves in danger by getting too close.
*   **D:**  The passage clearly states they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.

Therefore, the statement that moose are aggressive is **not true** based on the provided text."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungase kube ingozi ngomuntu ohamba ogwadule?","The correct answer is **A: Ukungabi nazo izingubo ezifudumele ngobusuku obubandayo** (Not having warm clothes on a cold night).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even the hottest deserts get very cold at night, and this can lead to dangerous hypothermia *without warm clothing*. 

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: Ukubona utalagu oluzenza sengathi amanzi** (Seeing a mirage that looks like water) - While this is mentioned as a hazard, the *danger* comes from the actions taken *because* of the mirage (wasting energy and water).
* **C: Ukumosha amandla uzama ukujaha utalagu** (Wasting energy trying to hunt a mirage) - This is a consequence of the mirage, not the primary danger itself.
* **D: Ukumosha amanzi njengoba ujaha utalagu** (Wasting water as you hunt a mirage) -  Similar to C, this is a consequence, not the direct threat.

The core, immediate danger the passage highlights is the cold and the need for warmth. Therefore, the lack of warm clothes is the most direct hazard."
Yini elandelayo engaboniswanga njengengaba usongo kubantu abahamba ogwadule?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukushiswa ilanga (Sunburn)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses dangers in the desert including:

*   **Utalagu (Mirages):** Described as appearing like water, leading travelers astray.
*   **Ukwehla kwamazinga okushisa komzimba (Hypothermia):**  The passage specifically mentions extreme cold at night and the risk of hypothermia.
*   **Ukushodelwa amanzi (Dehydration):** It states travelers can deplete their precious water supplies by following mirages.

The passage *does not* mention the risk of sunburn, although it is a risk in the desert. Therefore, it is the danger *not* described in the text.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiliphi iqembu labantu elathinteka kakhulu ngemva kokufika abahloli?","The correct answer is **C: AbaseTaínos**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that after the arrival of European explorers, the population of the Taínos was dramatically reduced by the Spanish conquistadors. It even provides a figure (approximately 100,000) of Taínos killed between 1492 and 1498. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: AbaseHaiti** - The text mentions Haiti as sharing the island, but doesn't say they were significantly affected *immediately* after the explorers arrived.
*   **B: AbaseCaribe** - While the text mentions the Caribe people lived on the island originally, it doesn’t say they were impacted by the explorers.
*   **D: Abantu baseSpain** - The Spanish were the *cause* of the impact, not the ones *affected* by it in this context."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiluphi ulimi olwalukhulunywa abantu baseCaribe?","The correct answer is **D: Isi-Arawaka**.

The text states: ""AmaCaribe bekungabantu abakhuluma isi-Arawaka..."" (The Caribe were people who spoke Arawakan).



"
Ubani onganconywa ngokudumisa ukutshuza njengomdlalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Abantu baseNorway**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ngo-1861 iqembu lokushushuluza eqhweni kokuzilibazisa lavulwa abantu baseNorway e-Australia."" (In 1861 a ski club for recreation was opened by Norwegians in Australia). This directly credits Norwegians with promoting skiing as a recreational activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ISki Bums:** While the passage mentions ""ski bums"" as enthusiasts, it doesn't say they *originated* or *promoted* the sport.
*   **C: Abantu abahlala emgedeni:** This option is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Abantu base-Australia:** The passage states Norwegians *opened a ski club in* Australia, not that Australians themselves were the promoters.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kwakungasiphi isikhathi lapho kwabhekwa khona okokuqala ukutshuza njengomdlalo?","The correct answer is **D: Ngekhulu lesi-17**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ukushushuluza eqhweni wehla entabeni njengomhlalo kuhlehlela emuva okungenani ekhulwini lama-17 leminyaka..."" which translates to ""Skiing down the mountain as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngekhulu lesi-18:** While a skiing club was *founded* in 1861, the text says the *sport* itself is older.
*   **B: Ngo-5000 BC:** This refers to depictions of skiers, not the sport as we know it.
*   **C: Ngo-1861:** This is when a recreational skiing club was formed, not when skiing was first considered a sport.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okumane kuhlotshaniswe njengesiqhingi esikhulu esisogwini olusempumalanga ye-Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Izilwane zasendle**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""IMadagascar yiyo enkulu kakhulu, futhi iyizwekazi ngokwayo uma kuziwa ezilwaneni zasendle."" This directly links Madagascar (the largest island) to its unique wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ithonya laseYurophu (European influence):** This is mentioned as a later historical development, not a defining characteristic of the islands themselves.
*   **B: Inkolo yamaSulumane (The Muslim religion):** While Islam is present, it's brought *to* the islands by Arabs, it doesn't define the islands as a whole.
*   **D: Izindawo zokuncebeleka zomntakabani (Beach tourism spots):** The passage says the islands are *known* for this, but it's not what makes the largest island unique.



"
Yini engesona isici seziqhingi ezincane eMpumalanga Ye-Afrika? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ukunganciki kwamanye amazwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...eziningi zeziqhingi ezincane izizwe ezizimele, *noma zihlangene neFulansi*..."" This directly contradicts the idea of them being independent. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: Ukuxhumana neFrance** - The text specifically mentions some islands being connected to France.
*   **B: Izindawo zokuncebeleka eziningi** - The passage says they are known as a ""beautiful seaside resort.""
*   **C: Idumela lezilwane zasendle** - The passage states Madagascar is ""particularly rich in wildlife.""



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ama-Easter agujwa kanjani ngamanye amasonto?","The correct answer is **B: Kubanjwa umlindelo ngoMgqibelo ebusuku**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amaningi amasonto akudala asazibamba Izinkonzo zePhasika njalo ngoMgqibelo ebusuku ngesikhathi sempelasonto yePhasika..."" which translates to ""Many congregations still hold Easter services every Saturday night during the Easter weekend..."" This directly indicates that some congregations hold vigils (umlindelo) on Saturday night as part of their Easter celebrations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Babamba imikhuba yokuzala** - While the passage *suggests* the origins might be in a pre-Christian spring fertility festival, it doesn't say the congregations *practice* those rituals.
* **C: Ukuba nomcimbi webandla** -  This is too general. The text specifies a particular type of church event (a vigil).
* **D: Ukubukela ukushona kwelanga** - The passage mentions waiting to see the sunrise, not the sunset.



"
"Ukuze ugweme izimfuneko ezithile lapho ufika e-Ecuador, umuntu waseCuba kufanele abe nani kuqala?","The correct answer is **B: Incwadi engokomthetho yesimemo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I-Ecuador ilindele ukuthi izakhamuzi zase-Cuba zithole incwadi yesimemo ngaphambi kokungena e-Ecuadore..."" (Ecuador expects Cuban citizens to obtain a letter of invitation before entering Ecuador...). This is the primary requirement mentioned for Cuban citizens entering Ecuador.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While a passport with 6 months validity is necessary, it doesn't *waive* any requirements. It's a standard travel document requirement.
*   **C:** A return ticket is *required* but doesn't help avoid requirements, it *proves* something.
*   **D:** A US green card allows for an *exemption* to the letter of invitation requirement by visiting the Ecuadorian consulate, but it's not what you need to start with to avoid the requirement in the first place.



"
Izimfuneko zase-Ecuador zokuvakasha azenzelwe ini yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuqondisa ukufika kwabantu abavela kwamanye amazwe** (To regulate the arrival of people from other countries).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the requirements are ""designed to provide an orderly manner of transportation between both countries.""  This means the purpose is to *regulate* and manage who is entering Ecuador, not to limit the number of visitors (A), dictate length of stay (C) although it does require proof of a return ticket to understand that, or solely verify passport validity (D) – passport validity is *part* of the regulation but not the overarching goal.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabiza kakhulu kwelinye izwe kunasezweni lakini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ifuleyimu yezibuko (Eyeglass frames)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Amafulemu aseqophelweni eliphezulu wamagama abizayo atholakala kulezi zindawo angaba nezinkinga ezimbili; amanye kungaba omgunyathi, futhi **angempela avela kwamanye amazwe angabiza kakhulu kunasekhaya.**"" (High-end designer frames found in these locations can have two problems; some may be counterfeit, and **real ones from other countries can be more expensive than at home.**)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuhlolwa amehlo (Eye exams):** The passage says eye exams *can be cheaper* in other countries.
*   **C: Umshwalense wokubona (Vision insurance):**  The passage doesn't mention the cost of insurance being higher abroad. It suggests using insurance at home.
*   **D: Ifuleyimu engenalo igama (Non-branded frames):** The passage doesn't indicate that non-branded frames would be more expensive. It focuses on the cost of *designer* frames.



"
Yibuphi ubungozi bokuthenga ifuleyimu kwelinye izwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Angase abe umbombayi (They might be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""amafulemu aseqophelweni eliphezulu wamagama abizayo atholakala kulezi zindawo angaba nezinkinga ezimbili; amanye kungaba **omgunyathi**...""  ""Omgunyathi"" translates to ""counterfeit"".

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kungase kudingeke ukuba uphinde uhlole amehlo (You might need to re-examine your eyes):** The passage doesn’t suggest that the lenses themselves will *require* another eye exam, just that the price can be lower in other countries.
*   **B: Incwadi kadokotela ingase ingahlanganisi amanye amafuleyimu (The doctor's prescription might not fit other lenses):** The passage doesn't mention prescription compatibility.
*   **D: Umshwalense ungase ungayikhokheli (Insurance might not pay):** While this *could* be true, the passage states that insurance might *cover* costs at home, but doesn't directly say it won't cover foreign purchases.

Therefore, the primary risk highlighted in the passage is the possibility of receiving counterfeit lenses when buying from abroad."
"Mayelana nokusebenzisa imali eFalkland, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende eziyiqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Ngaphandle kwamaphawundi aseFalkland, iphawundi laseBrithani liyimali ngokuvamile eyamukelekayo**.

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Amaphawundi wase-Britain ngokuvamile azokwamukelwa noma yikuphi eziqhingini"" (British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says credit cards *and* British pounds are accepted, *and* USD are also widely accepted.
*   **B:** The text states USD is widely accepted, but doesn't say Stanley is the *only* place.
*   **C:** The text explicitly says to exchange Falkland Islands pounds *before* leaving the islands, making this statement false."
"Ngokwale ndaba, lapho uvakashela iFalkland uqhamuka e-United States, iyiphi indlela yokukhokha engase ibe usizo ngaphandle kokusebenzisa ikhadi le-credit?","The correct answer is **B: Kuzo zonke iziqhingi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that US dollars are ""generally accepted"" throughout the Falkland Islands, and British pounds are also accepted. While credit cards are limited, cash in these two currencies is widely usable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estolo iFIC West** - This is just the location where Falkland Islands Pounds can be exchanged, not a general method of payment.
*   **C: Eziqhingini ezingaphandle** - The text specifically mentions credit cards are *unlikely* to be accepted outside of Stanley.
*   **D: Kuyo yonke indawo yaseStanley** - While credit cards and US dollars are accepted in Stanley, the text says US dollars are *generally* accepted throughout the islands.



"
Yisiphi isenzakalo esingahlobene nokugubha umkhosi wasethempelini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuzalwa kwendlovu (The birth of an elephant)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes temple festivals as being connected to:

*   Annual festivals lasting from late November to mid-May.
*   Temple anniversaries.
*   The birthdays of the presiding deity (god/goddess).
*   Large events involving the temple.

While decorated elephants are *part of* the festivals, the birth of an elephant is not a reason *for* the festival itself. The other options are all directly mentioned as reasons for celebration."
Zingabonakala kuphi izindlovu ezihlotshisiwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho kuqhubeka imikhosi ethempelini** (Where temple festivals are taking place).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iningi lemikhosi yethempeli ligujwa...kanye nokumasha kwezindlovu ezihlotshisiwe..."" (Many temple festivals are celebrated...along with the parade of decorated elephants...) This directly links the decorated elephants to the temple festivals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yonke indawo kusukela ekupheleni kukaNovemba kuya Phakathi kukaMeyi** (Everywhere from the end of November to mid-May) - While the festivals happen *during* this time, it doesn't mean elephants are everywhere.
* **B: Emathempelini** (In temples) - Elephants aren't just *in* the temples, they are part of the processions *during* the festivals.
* **D: Emigwaqweni yaseKerala** (On the streets of Kerala) - While processions might *use* the streets, the elephants are specifically linked to the temple festivals, not just generally on the streets.

"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indlela kulezi ezilandelayo ongalondoloza ngayo imali uma ugibela i-business noma i-first class ebhanoyini?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthenga usebenzisa inkampani (Purchasing through a company)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Noma kunjalo, lokhu akufiki kalula: njengomthetho obekiwe, ungalindela ukukhokha izikhathi eziphindwe kane kunenani elivamile lomnotho webhizinisi, kanye nezikhathi eziyishumi nanye ezingeni lokuqala!

Noma kunjalo, lokhu akufiki kaluda: njengomthetho obekiwe, ungalindela ukukhokha izikhathi eziphindwe kane kunenani elivamile lomnotho webhizinisi, kanye nezikhathi eziyishumi nanye ezingeni lokuqala!"" (However, this doesn't come easy: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times the standard economy fare, and eleven times at first class!). However, it also says ""Noma kunjalo, wenze inkampani yakho ikwenzele lokho (or, even better, have your company do that)"" which implies that having your company pay can make it more feasible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukubhuka i-first class kunokubhuka i-business class (Booking first class instead of business class)** - The passage says first class is *even more* expensive.
*   **C: Bhuka i-first class ebhanoyini elingayi ngqo lapho oya khona (Booking first class on a flight that doesn't go directly to your destination)** - The passage doesn't suggest this as a way to save money.
*   **D: Ukuthola isaphulelo (Getting a discount)** - The passage explicitly states that discounts are unlikely (""akusizi ngisho nokufuna izaphulelo"")."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaba ukumosha isikhathi ukuba uyifune lapho ufuna ukubhuka isigaba esithile?","The correct answer is **D: I-First class**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that you can expect to pay **eleven times** the normal economic value for a First Class seat.  It also highlights how expensive it is and that discounts are unlikely.  The passage focuses on the extreme cost of obtaining a First Class seat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amabhanoyi aya ngqo lapho oya khona:** This doesn't relate to the passage's discussion about cost and different cabin classes.
*   **B: Isigaba se-Business:** While Business Class is mentioned, the passage emphasizes that even discounts on Business Class are rare and that First Class is far more expensive.
*   **C: Izaphulelo:** The passage explicitly states that seeking discounts on Business or First Class is generally not worthwhile.



"
Yini okungafanele yengezwe lapho uqhathanisa amanani okuya e-Afrika kanye namanani omhlaba wonke?,"The correct answer is **A: Izindleko ezengeziwe zama-visa ezindawo ezingaphandle we-Afrika**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states to *not forget* to include extra costs of visas, taxes, and transport *for all locations outside of Africa* when comparing prices.  Options B and C refer to costs *within* Africa, which are not what the text highlights as an additional comparison factor. Option D is accurate but less specific than option A. 

Therefore, the item that shouldn't be *forgotten* to add to the global travel cost is the additional visa costs for places *outside* Africa."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini izitolo ezinkulu eseziqala ukuyinikeza ehlukile ongayikhetha?","The correct answer is **A: Ukudla osekulungile (Ready-made food)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Izitolo ezinkulu ngokwandayo zithola ingxenye ehlukahlukene kakhulu yokudla okulungele ukudliwa."" (Supermarkets are increasingly getting a more diverse selection of ready-made food.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ama-microwave anohhavini (Microwave ovens):** While some supermarkets offer these, the passage doesn't say they're a new offering *unique* to supermarkets.
*   **C: Izindawo zokudlela ezingaphakathi (In-store dining areas):** The passage mentions these exist in some places, but they are described as ""ngokuvamile engekho emthethweni"" (often unofficial) and aren't presented as a new trend.
*   **D: Amanani angabizi kakhulu (Lower prices):** The passage suggests supermarkets are a cost-effective way to eat, but doesn't specify that lower prices are a *new* thing they are offering.



"
Yiluphi usizo olunikezwa ezinye izitolo ezinkulu okungase kuthandeke kumakhasimende athenga ukudla osekulungile?,"The correct answer is **D: Imicrowave enohhavini**.

The passage states: ""Ezinye zinikeza ngisho nangohhavini we-microwave noma enye indlela yokufudumeza ukudla."" This directly addresses a service offered by some supermarkets for customers purchasing ready-to-eat food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Izindawo zokudlela ezingaphakathi** - While the passage mentions informal dining areas, it doesn't present them as a feature specifically for those buying ready-made food.
* **B: Okuncane ongakukhetha** - The passage actually states the *choice* is limited when buying ready-to-eat.
* **C: Ukudla okungaphekiwe** - The passage is focusing on *ready-to-eat* food, not food that needs cooking.

Yini elandelayo engase ingaqondwa abantu abakhuluma isiFulentshi baseBelgium kanye nabaseSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Indlela yesiFulentshi yokusebenzisa izinombolo** (The French way of using numbers).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ikakhulukazi, uhlelo lokubala e-Belgium kanye nase-Switzerland ekhuluma isiFulentshi nokuhluka okuncane esiFulentshini esikhulunywa eFulansi..."" (Especially, the number system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland differs slightly from the French spoken in France...).

The other options are mentioned as minor differences (pronunciation - ""ukuphinyiselwa kwamagama athile kuhlukile kancane"") but the number system is specifically highlighted as a key difference.  The passage also indicates understanding isn't a problem *even* with standard French numbers because they learn standard French in school.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungafani eFrance njengoba kunjalo eBelgium noma eSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Indlela izinombolo ezibizwa ngayo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the **numbering system** (how numbers are said) is different in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France. While pronunciation of *some* words is slightly different (D), the passage highlights the numbering system as the key distinction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuphimisela wonke amagama** - The passage states there are *slight* pronunciation differences, not that *all* words are pronounced differently.
*   **C: IsiFulentshi esifundiswa esikoleni** - The passage says they all learn standard French in school, so this is a similarity, not a difference.
*   **D: Ukubiza amanye amagama esiFulentshi** -  This is true, but the numbering system is specifically noted as a difference in the text.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that to get the bereavement fare, you *must* book **directly by phone with the airline**.  Booking through any other method (like a third-party website) would make you ineligible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uma ugibele iWestJet** - WestJet *is* an airline that offers bereavement fares.
*   **C: Uma uhamba ngeLufthansa usuka ePeris uya e-United States** - Lufthansa *is* an airline that offers bereavement fares, and the origin/destination doesn't disqualify you.
*   **D: Uma ugibele iDelta** - Delta *is* an airline that offers bereavement fares.



"
Ikuphi okuyiqiniso ngesibonelelo sokushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kufanele kubhukwe ngokuqondile nabezindiza usebenzisa ucingo.**

The passage specifically states: ""Kumelwe ubhukhe ngefoni ngokuqondile nenkampani yezindiza.""  This means reservations must be made directly with the airline over the phone.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The benefit relates to *reducing* costs for bereavement travel, not covering the full cost.
* **B:** The passage states booking *must* be done by phone, not through a website.
* **C:** The benefit aims to reduce the 'last-minute' fare, not simply pay the last-minute fare.

Kunini lapho ukusebenzisa khona iGPS ezimele kungaba usizo kakhulu kunokusebenzisa iGPS ekuyi-app?,"The correct answer is **C: Uma uya endaweni lapho ungalahlekelwa khona i-inthanethi** (If you are going to a place where you might lose internet).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that smartphone GPS apps rely on data connection and may be limited or unusable without it. A standalone GPS doesn't need data, making it more reliable in areas with no internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uma uzama ukulondoloza imali** - The passage says apps *save* money compared to buying standalone GPS units.
*   **B: Uma uqiniseka ukuthi uzoba nayo idata yokuxhuma** - If you have data, an app is a good option. A standalone GPS isn't *needed*.
*   **D: Uma ungafuni ukuqasha umshini wayo** - The passage mentions renting a GPS as an alternative, but the question is about when a standalone GPS is *more helpful* than an app, not about avoiding rentals."
Ikuphi okungesona isizathu esihle sokusebenzisa iGPS eyi-app kunokusebenzisa leyo ezimele?,"The correct answer is **A: Uma ungadingi ukukhathazeka ngokuxhuma kwidata**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that GPS apps *require* data connection to function properly.  A standalone GPS doesn't need data. So, if you *don't* want to worry about data, a standalone GPS is the better option, making this the opposite of a good reason to use a GPS app.

Let's look at why the other options are good reasons:

* **B: Ukulondoloza imali** - The passage directly states apps are cheaper than buying dedicated GPS devices.
* **C: Ukugwema ukuqasha umshini** - The passage also mentions avoiding rental costs.
* **D: Ungadingi ukuthenga ibalazwe elisha** - The passage states apps are cheaper than buying new maps.

"Ngokwale ndaba, ungaqiniseka kanjani ukuthi uqondaniswa nomkhumbi ofanele?","The correct answer is **C: Bhukha usebenzisa i-ejenti osebenza ngabavakashela eGalapago (Book using an agent specializing in Galapagos visitors)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Qinisekisa ukuthi umuntu okubhukelayo unguchwepheshe wamaGalapago onalwazi oluhle lwezinhlobonhlobo eziningi zemikhumbi."" (Ensure the person booking is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of the many types of ships).  An agent specializing in Galapagos travel will have this expertise.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Bhukha nibe iqembu labantu abangu-8+ eninezinto enizithandayo ezifanayo (Book with a group of 8+ people with similar interests)** - While traveling with a group might be nice, the passage doesn't prioritize this as a way to get the right ship.
*   **B: Bhukha ngesikhathi lapho bengebaningi ababhukhayo (Book during a time when fewer people are booking)** - The passage does mention booking early because ships fill up, but it doesn’t say this *guarantees* you'll get the right ship.
*   **D: Bhukha kusasenesikhathi (Book early)** - The passage says booking early is important to *secure a space*, not to ensure you get the *right* ship.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasetshenziswa njengeqhinga lokukhuthaza izivakashi ukuba ziqhubeke nokugembula?","The correct answer is **C: Ukubapha iziphuzo (Giving them drinks)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that casinos often have ""special food, drinks, and entertainment"" to keep visitors happy and *inside* the casino. It also mentions providing alcohol.  This aligns directly with the goal of encouraging people to gamble longer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuningi bokukhanya kwemvelo (Lots of natural light)** - The passage states casinos typically *lack* windows.
* **B: Ukubakhuthaza ngokubapha amathikithi amahhala (Encouraging them by giving them free tickets)** - While casinos might offer comps, it's not highlighted as a primary tactic in this passage.
* **D: Ukungabikhona kwamawashi (The absence of clocks)** - The passage *does* mention it's difficult to find exits, which is similar in intent to lacking clocks (disorienting people), but the passage highlights *drinks* as a specific method to keep people gambling.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umuntu ogembulayo ohlakaniphile okufanele ayigweme?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphuza kakhulu utshwala (Drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nokho, ukudakwa kudunga ingqondo, bonke abantu abagembulayo abahle bayakwazi ukubaluleka kokuhlala usangulukile."" (However, intoxication clouds judgment, all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.) This directly warns against excessive alcohol consumption.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ukwamukela izinto ezikhuthazayo (Accepting promotions):** While casinos offer perks, the passage doesn't specifically warn against *accepting* them, but rather focuses on keeping people *inside* the casino.
* **C: Ukuhlola isikhathi (Checking the time):** The passage doesn't mention time at all.
* **D: Ukubuza ngendawo eseduze yokuphuma (Asking for the nearest exit):** The passage states exits are difficult to find, but doesn't say avoiding asking for them is a wise strategy. In fact, knowing where exits are is *more* beneficial to a smart gambler.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi ingxenye yenkulumo eyenziwa osonhlamvukazi phakathi nomusho?","The correct answer is **A: Izenzo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that capital letters (like ""Sie"") in the middle of a sentence distinguish *verbs* (izenzo) from nouns (amabizo). The passage highlights this as a way to tell the difference between them. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amabizo (Nouns)**: The passage says capital letters *separate* verbs from nouns, not that they identify nouns.
*   **C: Iziphawulo (Adjectives)**: The passage doesn't mention adjectives in relation to capitalization.
*   **D: Izandiso (Extensions/Affixes)**: This doesn't fit the context of the passage at all.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engeza kuhluke ukwenza amabizo abe osonhlamvukazi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlukanisa phakathi kwezenzo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that starting nouns (and ""Sie"") with a capital letter ""is a good way to distinguish between actions and things."" This directly means it helps to *separate* actions (verbs) from nouns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukufunda (Reading):** While it makes reading easier, the *purpose* of the capitalization isn't reading itself, but the clarity it provides.
*   **C: Ukubhala (Writing):** The passage admits writing becomes *more* complex because of this rule.
*   **D: Ukuhlukanisa phakathi kwezinto (Distinguishing between things):** The passage states it helps separate actions *from* things, not things from each other.



"
"Ezindaweni zasemaphandleni zaseMalaysia, isiphi isenzo esisho “ukuqoba”?","The correct answer is **A: Ukugobisa umunwe wokukhomba** (Pointing the index finger).

Here's why:

The passage states that in rural Malaysia, a wave (similar to a Western wave with the palm facing the waver) means ""come."" It then contrasts this with how a British traveler in Spain might mistakenly interpret a wave with the palm facing the waver as meaning ""go back.""  This implies that pointing the index finger is the Malaysian equivalent of a ""stop"" or ""go away"" gesture – essentially, ""no"" or ""leave.""



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isenzo esingase sisho “ukubuya”?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuhambisa isandla usebenzisa isihlakala sibheke ngaphandle**.

The text specifically states: ""isihambi saseBrithani eSpeyini singenza iphutha lokucabanga ukuthi ukuvayela okuhlanganisa intende yesandla ebheke umvayeli (kunomuntu ovayelwayo) isho ukuthi buya."" This describes waving with the palm facing outwards, which is misinterpreted as a ""come back"" gesture.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ebangela imifantu?","The correct answer is **A: Amabhuloho eqhwa** (Ice crevasses).

The passage specifically states: ""imifantu, engafihlwa amabhuloho eqhwa"" which translates to ""crevasses, hidden by ice cracks."" Therefore, ice cracks (amabhuloho eqhwa) cause the crevasses (imifantu).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungafihlwa amabhuloho amaqhwa?","The correct answer is **B: Imigede yamaqhwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...imifantu, engafihlwa amabhuloho eqhwa."" (""...crevasses, which can be hidden by snow bridges."") 

""Imifantu"" translates to crevasses, and those crevasses are hidden by ""amabhuloho eqhwa"" (snow bridges). Therefore, snow bridges hide crevasses.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, abantu abahambayo kufanele bathathe izinyathelo zokuphepha ngaphambi kokuvakashela ziphi izindawo?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo ezizungeze iGoma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Noma ikuphi ukuvakasha ngaphandle kweGoma kumelwe kucwaningwe ukuze uzwisise isimo sokulwa okusesifundazweni saseNyakatho Kivu."" This directly means travelers should take safety precautions and research areas *outside* of Goma itself due to the fighting in the North Kivu province.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Intabamlilo yaseNyirogongo:** While the text mentions the volcano, it doesn't say visitors need special precautions *specifically* for the volcano itself, just that Goma is a base for visiting it.
*   **C: Inkaba yedolobha:** The text states Goma is ""somewhat safe,"" implying precautions aren't as urgent within the city center.
*   **D: ERwanda:** The text mentions Rwanda in relation to Goma's location, but doesn't suggest any special safety concerns for travel *to* Rwanda."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kube kuhle ngomuntu ovakashele iGoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Izimpi zokulwa eNorth Kivu ziyathakazlisa** (The conflict in North Kivu is exciting).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that any travel outside of Goma needs to be researched due to the ongoing conflict in North Kivu. This implies the conflict is *not* something desirable or exciting for tourists, but a safety concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Yindawo enhle kubantu abathanda iMountain Gorilla Tracking** (It is a good place for people who like Mountain Gorilla Tracking) - The passage states Goma is a base for cheaper gorilla tracking.
*   **C: Amabhayisikili izinto ezikahle kakhulu zokuhamba hamba** (Motorbikes are the best way to get around) - The passage mentions boda-bodas (motorbike taxis) are commonly used for short trips.
*   **D: Isizinda sentabamlilo yaseNyiragongo sisedolobheni** (The Nyiragongo volcano is in the city) - The passage states Goma is a jumping-off point for visiting the Nyiragongo volcano.



"
Imvume yokuhamba endawni engagadiwe mayelana nosuku lokuqala ngo-Agasti izotholakala nini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngomhlaka-1 Aphreli**.

Here's why:

The passage states permits are available on the first of the month, four months *before* the start of the month you want to hike.  August is four months after April. Therefore, permits for an August start date become available on April 1st."
Iyiphi inqubomgomo ekhona mayelana nokuvikela udonga olubangelwa umvula?,"The correct answer is **D: Kunamanani alinganiselwe ezimvume**.

Here's why:

The passage states that permits are *limited* to protect the canyon walls. This directly indicates that there's a controlled number of permits available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhlelo lokusiza ofike kuqala** - While there *are* permits available for walk-ups, this isn't the primary policy for protecting the canyon walls. It's a consequence of limited availability.
*   **B: Imvume itholakala kuphela ngomhlaka-1 Januwari** - The passage states permits become available on the 1st of the month four months in advance, not just January 1st.
*   **C: Imvume itholakala kuphela ngokuthi ungene ngenyawo uzoyicela** - Walk-up permits are *available*, but not the *only* way to get one.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okungase kutholakale ohlotsheni lwehhotela elichazwe kule ndaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Izivakashi ezaziwa kahle futhi eziqashelwayo** (Well-known and respected guests).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states these hotels were where ""the rich and famous of the time"" would stay, and sometimes hosted ""commanders and other officials."" This directly indicates a history of hosting notable and respected guests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Itafula elinotshwala** (A bar) - While these hotels likely *had* bars, it's not a defining characteristic specifically linked to this *type* of historical hotel.
* **B: Indawo yokudlela esesakhiweni yabantu abathanda ukudla** (A dining room for foodies) - The passage doesn't emphasize a focus on exceptional cuisine, just the historical atmosphere.
* **D: Amagumbi alungiswe ngezinto zesimanje** (Rooms furnished with modern amenities) - The passage emphasizes the *lack* of modern amenities and the hotels' vintage character.



"
"Ngokwalolu lwazi olulandelayo kule ndaba, yiziphi izinto ezinikezwayo lezo izivakashi zasehhotela ezingase zingakubheki njengokusemqoka?","The correct answer is **D: Amagumbi angabizi**.

Here's why:

The text describes hotels that catered to the *wealthy and famous*. The focus is on the *opulence, history, and experience* of staying in these grand hotels.  Luxury and extravagance are key themes.

Let's look at why the other options are likely important to guests at these hotels:

* **A: Ifanisha yasendulo egcwele kuso sonke isakhiwo (Antique furnishings throughout the building):** This directly ties into the ""old-world charm"" and ""historical period"" emphasized in the text.  A rich aesthetic would be expected.
* **B: Indawo yokudla enompheki ovelele (Dining venue with a renowned chef):**  Wealthy guests would likely expect high-quality dining.
* **C: Indawo yokuphumula enomnandi basebusuku (Entertaining lounge with evening events):**  The text specifically mentions these hotels often had ""evening events"" and a ""social atmosphere"".

However, *affordability* is the opposite of what these hotels would offer. They catered to those with *plenty* of money, so the price of the rooms wouldn't be a primary concern.  In fact, high prices would likely *contribute* to the hotel's exclusivity and prestige.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engagwenya izivakashi lapho zivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **D: Ukubhekisela kubantu baseGreenland ngokuthi “ama-Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Nakuba igama elithi """"Eskimo"""" lihlala lamukelekile eMelika, lithathwa njengokweyisa abantu abaningi abangahlali eMelika base-Arctic, ikakhulukazi eCanada... kumelwe ligwenywe abantu bakwamanye amazwe."" (Although the term ""Eskimo"" is still acceptable in America, it is considered offensive by many non-American Arctic people, especially in Canada... it should be avoided by people from other countries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says crime is generally unknown in Greenland and there are no “violent areas”.
*   **B:** The text warns visitors to *prepare* for cold weather, not warm weather.
*   **C:** The text states that Greenland is well-connected with 93% internet access, so visitors should expect to have access.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini elandelayo engase ibe inkinga ngezivakashi ezingazilungiselele lapho zivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **C: Isimo sezulu**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Isimo sezulu esibandayo cishe yiyo kuphela ingozi engokoqobo abangazilungiselele abazohlangabezana nayo. Uma uvakashela iZwe Eliluhlaza ngenkathi ebandayo... kubalulekile ukuphatha okokugqoka okufudumele ngokwanele.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Omiyane be-Nordic** - While the text mentions them, it says they are only a nuisance (""bangacasula"") not a serious danger requiring preparation.
*   **B: Ubugebengu** - The text explicitly states that crime is virtually unknown in Greenland.
*   **D: Abantu bendawo** - The text says Greenland is safe in terms of interacting with locals.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo manje okusetshenziswa njengenkaba yezindawo zomphakathi edolobheni?,"The correct answer is **A: IJardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Manje isebenza njengesigcawu esiyinhloko edolobheni..."" referring to IJardín de la Unión. This directly translates to it functioning as the main square/hub of the city.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I-Alley of the Kiss:**  This is a specific alley known for a romantic story, not a central public space.
* **C: ITemplo de San Diego:** The text says it was the *only surviving building* from the 17th century, but doesn't state it's currently used as a public square.
* **D: ICallejon del Beso:** Same as B - it's an alley with a story, not a main public area.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatholakali eJardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Isakhiwo esidala esinezinto zamasonto**.

Here's why:

The text states that *I-Templo de San Diego* (the Temple of San Diego) was the *only surviving building from the 17th century* when Jardín de la Unión was first established. It doesn't say the garden *itself* contains religious artifacts from the 17th century, only that the temple does.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and found in the text:

*   **A: Izindawo ezimaphakathi zamatende ezinekhonsathi (Indoor areas with concert tents)** - The text specifically mentions concerts are given ""from the main stage.""
*   **B: Indawo enezindaba zothando zakudala (A place with old love stories)** -  *Callejon del Beso* (Alley of the Kiss) is described as the home of an old love story.
*   **C: Izingadi ezibheke izindawo zokudla (Gardens overlooking dining areas)** - The text states there are ""many restaurants surrounding the garden.""



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo mayelana nosuku lokuqwala olubonakala lunganembile?","The correct answer is **D: Ukusuku lokuqwala alulona usuku okufanele lwangaphandle emndenini enabantwana.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that families *can* enjoy hiking, even with young children and preschoolers, though they *may need extra preparation*. Option D claims hiking is *not* a suitable outdoor activity for families with children, which directly contradicts the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage says hiking on an easy trail requires *little* preparation, not *too little*.
*   **B:** The passage states hikes can range from short to distances covered in a single day.
*   **C:** The passage explicitly says people in good physical condition will generally enjoy hiking.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kunini lapho usuku lokuqwala ludinga ukulungiselela okuncane?","The correct answer is **B: Uma kuzohanjwa endaweni elula** (If the hike is on an easy trail).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukuhamba emini emzileni olula kudinga ukuzilungiselela okuncane..."" which translates to ""Day hiking on an easy trail requires little preparation...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uma oqwalayo ekulungele ngokomzimba** (If the hiker is physically fit) - While being fit helps, the passage doesn't say it *minimizes* preparation.
*   **C: Lapho kuzohamba nezingane ziyoqwala** (When hiking with children) - The passage specifically states families with children *need extra* preparation.
*   **D: Uma ukuqwala kuzokwenziwa endaweni enemvelo** (If the hike will be in a natural area) - Hiking in nature is the definition of the activity, not a factor determining preparation level.



"
Uyini umehluko ngamathafa aseRogaland noma e-Agder uma eqhathaniswa nawo wonke aseNorway?,"The correct answer is **D: Avame ukumbozwa izimbali eziphephuli** (They are often covered in heather).

Here's why:

The text specifically states that in Rogaland and Agder, these landscapes (""hei"") are *often covered in heather*. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A: Anezihlahla** (Have trees) - The text states these areas are generally *without* trees (""inkangala engenamithi"").
*   **B: Izindawo eziphakathi nentaba ezinemifula** (Mountainous areas with rivers) - The text doesn't mention mountains or rivers.
*   **C: Amathafa iningi lawo ayalingana** (The areas are mostly flat) - While the text mentions flat areas (""elilingene""), this isn't specific to Rogaland and Agder. It describes Norwegian landscapes generally.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kujwayeleke ngeNorway?","The correct answer is **B: Amathafa anezihlahla (Forests)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes Norwegian landscapes as typically having *open* areas, ""vidde"" (broad, open, treeless areas) and ""hei"" (often heather-covered treeless areas). It emphasizes the *lack* of trees. Therefore, forests would be *uncommon* in Norway according to this text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izindawo ezivulekile emhlabathini (Open areas on the ground):** This *is* typical, as described by ""vidde"" and ""hei"".
*   **C: Izindawo eziphakathi nezintaba ezikhuphukelayo (Areas between rising mountains):** The passage mentions fjords which are formed by glacial activity in mountainous regions, implying such areas exist.
*   **D: Indawo eyizinkalo (Coastal areas):** The passage explicitly states entering ""fjords"" which are coastal inlets.



"
Izivakashi ezithanda ukutshuza kufanele zisivakashele nini isiteshi esisegqumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Phakathi nasebusika**.

The passage explicitly states that the hills ""get enough snow and offer recreation such as sledding or tubing."" This makes winter the ideal time for visitors who enjoy snow activities."
"Ngokwale ndaba, kunini lapho kuvame ukuba khona nezivakashi eziningi esiteshini esisegqumeni?","The correct answer is **C: Phakathi nehlobo laseNdiya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inkathi yezivakashi ezindaweni zamagquma iyenyuka **phakathi nehlobo laseNdiya**."" (The tourist season in hill stations rises **during the Indian summer**). 

While the passage *also* mentions winter tourism, it specifically states the *peak* season is during the Indian summer.



"
Yini okufanele uyigweme uma unethemba lokuthola isikebhe sidinga usizo?,"The correct answer is **C: Uma ukhangisa ngezinkonzo ozenzayo**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes building relationships and letting people come to *you* with opportunities. Actively advertising your services is the opposite of that approach. The text suggests passively gathering information and letting word spread about your willingness to help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lapho wehla wenyuka lapho zipaka khona:** The passage *encourages* walking around the docks.
*   **B: Ukuba umngane nokaputeni:** Building relationships *is* a good thing, as the passage states you should talk to many people.
*   **D: Ukugwema abantu abacela ukuhayikha isikembe:** The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding people asking for rides; it focuses on those needing crew.



"
Yini okufanele uyenze eduzane nethekhu lesikebhe lapho ubheka isikebhe esidinga usizo?,"The correct answer is **A: Xhumana nomshayeli waso**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes talking to as many people as possible and learning which ships *need* someone. The captain (or ""umshayeli waso"" - the ship's driver) is the person who would know if their ship is looking for help and what kind of help they need.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hlale usendaweni lapho ungabonakala khona:** While visibility is good, simply *being seen* doesn't get you information about needed help.
*   **C: Iya kubantu kuphela lapho besahlanza izikebhe zabo:** Limiting yourself to only those cleaning ships significantly restricts who you can talk to and the information you can gather.
*   **D: Gwema abacela ukuhayikha isikebhe:** The passage implies you *should* interact with people asking for rides, as they might share valuable information.



"
Iyiphi indawo engabonakala ikhanga izivakashi ngomlando wamakholoni eziqhingini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ogwini oluseNyakatho**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Iningi kokuthuthuka kwase-Hong Kong Island kugcwele ezweni elisanda kubuyiswa **nogwini olusenyakatho**. Le indawo abenzi bamakoloni baseBrithani abayithatha njengendawo yabo ngakho uma ufuna ukubona ubufakazi besikhathi esedlule sobukoloni salendawo, lena indawo efanele ongaqala kuyo."" This directly links the northern shore with the colonial history tourists would be interested in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: NgaseKowloon:** While the passage mentions Kowloon, it's as a viewing point *of* Hong Kong Island, not a place to find colonial history.
*   **C: Edolobheni eliseHong Kong:** This is too broad. The passage focuses on a specific part of Hong Kong Island.
*   **D: Itheku eliseVictoria:** The harbor is a scenic feature, but not specifically linked to the colonial history mentioned in the passage.



"
Iyiphi indawo engakhanga izivakashi ebheka ukubukeka kwendawo njengokubalulekile?,"The correct answer is **C: Isiqhingi SaseHong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isiqhingi saseHong Kong sinika indawo yaseHong Kong igama layo futhi yindawo leyo izivakashi eziningi eziyithatha njengendawo yokuvakashelwa eyinhloko."" This directly translates to ""Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is the area that many tourists take as a primary place to visit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Itheku eliseVictoria (Victoria Harbour):** The passage mentions Victoria Harbour, but as the *location* being viewed *from* Hong Kong Island, not the primary tourist destination itself.
*   **B: Indawo yaseHong Kong (Hong Kong area):** This is too broad; the passage specifically focuses on the Island.
*   **D: NgaseKowloon (Kowloon side):** The passage suggests going *to* Kowloon to get better views *of* Hong Kong Island, not that Kowloon itself is the main attraction for historical views.



"
Yini ezinye izinhlalo zamahhashi ezinakho ukusiza unciphise ukulimala konyawo lomgibeli lapho lubamnjwe umchilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Insimbi yokubambelela**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*ezinye izihlalo zehhashi, ngokukhethekile izihlalo zamaNgisi, zinezinsimbi zokuphepha ezivumela isikhumba sesitibili ukuba siwe esihlalweni lapho isihlalo sidonswelwa emuva umgibeli owayo.*"" This translates to ""some horse saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow the stirrup leather to release from the saddle when the rider is pulled.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indawo yokufaka izinyawo lapho incane** - The passage doesn't mention the size of the stirrup opening.
*   **C: into yokunyathela eyisikhumba** - The passage describes a leather stirrup *leather*, not a stirrup itself.
*   **D: Ukuzinza okukhulu** - While stirrups provide stability, the passage focuses on *safety* features to prevent injury when a rider gets caught.



"
Yisiphi isici esisiza unyawo lomgibeli ukuba andise amathuba okuphepha lapho esebenzisa into yokunyathela?,"The correct answer is **A: Isoli ehayayo futhi encane**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...abagibeli abaningi bagqoka amabhuzi okugibela anesithende **kanye nesoli ebushelelezi, ecijile**."" This type of sole is designed to prevent the foot from slipping *through* the stirrup, which is the primary safety concern mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Okuyisikhumba** - The passage doesn't highlight the material itself as a safety feature, just the design of the sole.
*   **C: Isithende** - While helpful for grip, the heel is mentioned alongside the sole, but the *type* of sole is the crucial part for stirrup safety.
*   **D: Isoli yonke** - The passage is specific about a smooth, beveled sole, not just any sole.



"
Yini enikezwa izivakashi ngokuxhumana ngokushintshisana kwezihambi?,"The correct answer is **A: Izindawo zokuhlala bese kuba khona umuntu wendawo ozonakekela** (Accommodation and a local to look after you).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the network **connects travelers with locals** in the cities they are visiting.
*   It explicitly mentions that Casey Fenton **received offers of free accommodation** from locals.
*   The core idea of the hospitality exchange is providing a place to stay and connecting with someone from the area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amabhanoyi ashibhile** (Cheap flights) - While the story *started* with a cheap flight, the network itself doesn't offer flights.
*   **C: Ukubukwa kwendawo okwenziwa umuntu wendawo** (Local sightseeing) - While locals *might* provide sightseeing, it's not the primary offering. The primary offering is the lodging.
*   **D: Ukuxhumana nabanye abavakashi abavakashele indawo efanayo** (Connecting with other visitors who have visited the same place) - The passage doesn't focus on connections *between* visitors, but between visitors and locals.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana nokushintshana ngezokuxhumana okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **A: Abavakashi bahlale benikezwa ukusikiselwa ngabantu bendawo abamukelanayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hospitality exchange networks *connect* travelers with locals. It does *not* say that travelers are always *given accommodation* by locals. It says they *find* people willing to offer it. The initial story of Couchsurfing even highlights Fenton having to *ask* for accommodation.

Let's look at why the other options are true, based on the text:

*   **B: Abanye bangase badinge ukuqinisekisa okwengeziwe okuvela kwabazovakasha** - The text states some networks ""may offer or require verification.""
*   **C: Abavakashi bazonikezwa uhlu lwabantu abamukelanayo abakhona kuwo wonke amadolobha** - The text mentions lists of hosts are ""published and/or online.""
*   **D: Ukubukezwa kwabantu abamukelanayo bendawo ngezinye izikhathi kuyanikezwa abavakashi** - The text specifically says reviews from other travelers are sometimes available.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwezivakashi olungase lutholakale luhlanganyele igumbi?","The correct answer is **A: Izivakashi ezineminyaka esekuqaleni kwamashumi amabili** (Guests in their early twenties).

Here's why:

The text states that hostels ""primarily accommodate young people – the typical guest is in their twenties."" While older travelers *can* be found, the main demographic is young adults.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Isivakashi esihamba sodwa** (Solo traveler) - The text doesn't specify whether guests travel alone or with others.
*   **C: Isivakashi esihamba nezingane ezincane** (Guest traveling with young children) - The text explicitly states that families with children are *not* common.
*   **D: Isivakashi esineminyaka ephakathi kwamashumi amathathu** (Guest in their thirties) - While possible, the text emphasizes the ""early twenties"" age group as typical.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase ahlale ehostela?","The correct answer is **B: Abantu abathathu abaneminyaka engu-22 abahamba ndawonye**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** Hostels primarily accommodate young people (typically in their 20s). 
* Option B fits this description perfectly – three people in their early 20s.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umbhanqwana ohamba nosana (A couple travelling with a baby):** The text says families with children are *not common* and only *some* hostels allow them in private rooms.
* **C: Umbhanqwana oseminyakeni yabo-70 (A couple in their 70s):** While the text says older travellers *can* be found, it's not the typical demographic.
* **D: Imindeni emibili ehamba nezingane (Two families travelling with children):**  This is explicitly stated as being uncommon.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esikuchaza ngokunembile ukuphonswa kwe-boomerang?","The correct answer is **D: Amanye ama-boomerang avame ukubuya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ama-boomerang amaningi atholakala e-Australia empeleni akuwona abuyayo."" (Many boomerangs found in Australia actually aren't returning ones). This means not *all* boomerangs return. It also implies that *some* do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ihlale ibuya kuwe esandleni uma uyiphonsi kahle** (It always returns to your hand if you throw it correctly) - This is false, as the passage says many don't return.
* **B: Ijwayeleke kakhulu kubantu bendawo kunezivakashi** (It is more popular among locals than tourists) - The passage says tourists *want* to learn, suggesting it's popular with them, but doesn't compare to local popularity.
* **C: Aziziningi izindawo zokudlala iboomerang e-Australia** (There are many places to play boomerang in Australia) - The passage doesn't mention anything about places to play.

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okusetshenziswa kakhulu lapho kwenziwa uhlobo oluthile lokudla kwesiJavanese?,"The correct answer is **C: Ushukela kakhukhunathi**.

The text specifically states: ""...ikakhulukazi ushukela waseJava kakhukhunathi"" (especially Javanese palm sugar). This indicates that palm sugar is a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isifo esithathelanayo sisakazeka kanjani?","The correct answer is **A: Abantu asebenaso isifo** (People who have the disease).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Isifo esithathelanwayo isifo esidluliseka kalula ngokuba seduze nomuntu onalesosifo."" This directly translates to ""A contagious disease is a disease that spreads easily by being close to a person who has the disease.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amagciwane amaningi** (Many germs) - While germs *cause* contagious diseases, the text focuses on *how* they spread - through people.
*   **C: Amagciwane** (Germs) - Same reason as B.
*   **D: Ukugoma** (Vaccination) - Vaccination *prevents* contagious diseases, it doesn't explain how they spread.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaziwa njengebangela ukutheleleka kwesifo?","The correct answer is **B: Amagciwane**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Isifo esithelelanayo sibangelwa **amabhakithiliya** adala izifo, **njengegciwane**, ibhakithiliya, isikhunta noma ezinye izilwane eziphila ngezinye.""  This directly identifies germs (like bacteria - *amagciwane*) as the cause of communicable diseases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukugoma (Vaccination)** - Vaccination *prevents* disease, it doesn't *cause* it.
*   **C: Amagciwane** - This is a repetition of B and slightly misspelled.
*   **D: Isikhunta (Fungus)** - While fungus can cause communicable diseases, the text lists it *as an example* of a germ that causes disease, not the sole cause of communicability.



"
Kukusiphi isibonelo lapho ukukhetha khona iwebusayithi ezokumela esikhundleni sokusebenzisa iVPN kube okwanele kulabo abayisebenzisayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umuntu osebenzisayo ngokuyinhloko uchezukisa isiminyaminya se-http**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that VPNs route *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.** Proxies, especially web proxies, typically only handle HTTP traffic.  If someone *only* needs to mask their IP address for basic HTTP browsing, a web proxy might be sufficient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umuntu osebenzisayo ufuna ukuchezukisa sonke isiminyaminya** - This is too broad. VPNs are for masking *all* traffic, and this doesn't specify the need to only mask HTTP.
* **B: Umuntu osebenzisayo ukhathazeke ngokugwema ukucwaninga kanye nokubukwa kangangokunokwenzeka** -  This suggests a need for the higher level of anonymity and security that VPNs offer (encryption, routing all traffic).
* **D: Izinto ezenziwa umuntu osebenzisayo zidinga isilinganiso esiphakeme senethiwekhi** - VPNs can sometimes *reduce* network speed due to the encryption process. This doesn't suggest a situation where a proxy would be enough.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana namaVPN kanye newebusayithi ezokumelela okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: IVPN ingakwazi ukuchezukisa kuphela isiminyaminya se-http**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that VPNs route *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP. This means they can encrypt all data, not just the data used by web browsers.  Options A, B, and C are all supported by the information in the passage:

*   **A:** VPNs offer more network control than web proxies.
*   **B:** Proxies don’t generally offer high levels of encryption.
*   **C:** VPNs generally have better service quality than web proxies.



"
Yini evumela omunye umuntu ukuba asebenzise ucingo lwenkampani ngaphandle indawo yabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Izincingo ezisebenza nge-inthanethi (Internet-based phones)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""Ngenxa yokuthi izingcingo zixhunywa nge-Inthanethi..."" (Because phones are connected via the Internet...). This is the foundational reason why location is no longer a constraint. The rest of the options are *ways* to use internet-based phones, but the internet connection itself is the enabling factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inamba yakwelinye izwe (An international number):** While you can *get* an international number, it's not what *allows* you to use a company phone remotely.
* **C: Isatellite (Satellite):** Satellite is mentioned as a *way* to get internet access in remote areas, but the core enabling technology is still the internet connection.
* **D: Ucingo lwePSTN (PSTN phone):** PSTN phones are traditional landlines and *cannot* be used remotely in the way described. The passage highlights the difference between PSTN phones and the new internet-based system.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okungase kudingeke ukuba yenziwe ukuze kutholakale izincingo ezithile?","The correct answer is **A: Thenga inombolo yocingo yomhlaba**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that because phones are connected via the internet now, you don't need a local phone number. It explicitly states you might *need to purchase a global number* specifically to allow traditional landline (PSTN) phones to reach you.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebenzisa ucingo lwenkampani yendawo:** The passage explicitly says *not* to use a company phone in your location.
* **C: Thola inombolo emphakathini okuwo:** The passage states you *don't* have to get a number in the community you live in.
* **D: Thenga ucingo lwePSTN:** The issue isn't the *type* of phone (PSTN), but having a number that can be reached by those phones.  You can use a PSTN phone to call the number you purchase, but you don't necessarily need to *buy* one.

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungakuchazi ngokunembile ukuphimisela amagama esiNtaliyani?,"The correct answer is **A: O-rr ababili babizwa ngenye indlela kunokubiza u-r oyedwa**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* states: ""Make sure you pronounce the letter r and the letters rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart."" This directly highlights that a double 'rr' is pronounced differently than a single 'r'.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says this *is* true - ""as many words are pronounced the way they are written.""
*   **C:** The passage says 'c' and 'g' are important to pay attention to because pronunciation *changes* based on what follows, implying they can be tricky, but not necessarily confusing.
*   **D:** This is a general statement that aligns with the idea that pronunciation depends on the following letter, but 'A' is the *specific* example given in the text.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo kwe-Izmir okwaba khona ngaphambi kwezinsuku zanamuhla?,"The correct answer is **D: Uphahla olungokwesiko olubomvu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ophahla olungokwesiko olubomvu, imakethe yangekhulu lama-18 leminyaka, kanye namathempeli namasonto..."" This indicates the red tile roofs and the 18th-century market existed *before* İzmir became the modern city described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umgwaqo obanzi okakwe izihlahla:** The passage mentions wide boulevards *now* lined with trees, suggesting they are a more recent development.
*   **B: Izakhiwo ezinezingilazi ngaphambili:** These are described as modern structures, implying they weren't present in the earlier form of the city.
*   **C: Izikhungu zezitolo:** These are also part of the modern development of İzmir.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi ngokunembile i-Izmir?,"The correct answer is **D: Kunetheku lesibili ngobukhulu eTurkey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that İzmir is the *third* largest city in Turkey**, not the second. The second largest is Istanbul.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the passage:

* **A: Idolobha elizungezwe indawo enkulu** - The passage says it's ""set in a large gulf and surrounded by mountains.""
* **B: Isimo sendawo sibonakalisa amasiko aseTurkey** - While it has a Mediterranean/European feel, the passage states it has a traditional red-tiled roof aesthetic and historical sites like temples and churches, reflecting Turkish culture.
* **C: Ungathola kokubili isikhungo sokuthenga sesimanje kanye namasonto amadala** -  The passage explicitly mentions ""modern, developed, and bustling shopping centers"" as well as ""temples and churches.""



"
Igama elithi hanami libhekisela ekubukeni ini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqhakaza kwamaPlum**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Umcabango uvela eShayina lapho izimbali zepulamu kwakuyimbali ethandwayo."" This means the original practice *hanami* came from China and involved appreciating plum blossoms. While it later became associated with cherry blossoms in Japan, the name originally referred to plum blossom viewing.



"
Ubani owenza umcimbi wokuqala onikelelwe ekubukeni izimbali eziqhakazayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbusi waseJapan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""EJapani, imicimbi yokuqala yokuqhakaza kwama-cherry yabungazwa **umbusi** yena kuphela kanye namanye amalungu ohlobo lobukhosi lwasezweni Esigodlweni saseBukhosini."" (In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing events were celebrated by the **emperor** alone and other members of the imperial family at the Imperial Court.)

While the *idea* of flower viewing originated in China, the first dedicated events in Japan were done by the emperor.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isici esilandelayo ngeJerusalema esingeke sibakhange kakhulu abantu abavakashile?","The correct answer is **B: Idumela layo njengenhloko dolobha yase-Israel**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many countries and the United Nations *do not* recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is a politically significant fact, it's less likely to be a primary draw for tourists compared to the other options. 

Let's look at why the other options are more attractive to tourists:

* **A: Ukubaluleka kwedolobha ngokwenkolo (The city's religious significance):** The text highlights that Jerusalem is holy to three major religions and a spiritual center – a huge attraction for many travelers.
* **C: Lokho elikunikezayo ngokwamasiko (What it offers culturally):**  The passage mentions Jerusalem is a cultural center with many historical sites and traditions.
* **D: Izindawo eziningi ezingokomlando (Numerous historical sites):** The passage directly states Jerusalem is a major tourist destination *because* of its many historical sites.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabaliwe endabeni njengento iJerusalema elaziwa ngako?,"The correct answer is **B: Ithonya lakhona kwezepolitiki** (Its political complexity).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Ulamndo wakhona omangalisayo** (Its amazing history) - ""linomlando othakazelisayo oneminyaka eyizinkulungwane""
    * **Ukubaluleka kwakhona kwezenkolo** (Its religious significance) - ""idolobha lingcwele ezinkolweni ezintathu""
    * **Izindawo zamasiko** (Cultural sites) - ""linezindawo eziningi zomlando, zemivubukulo kanye nezamasiko""

* **The passage *implies* political issues** by mentioning that many countries and the UN do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, but it doesn't directly elaborate on the *complexity* of those political issues. It only states the fact of non-recognition.



Therefore, the political complexity of Jerusalem is the aspect *not* fully detailed in the provided text."
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwezivakashi ezingeke zizuze ekuthengeni i-Wild Card?","The correct answer is **B: Isivakashi esivakashele kuphela iKruger National Park**.

Here's why:

The text states the Wild Card allows entry to *either* selected parks *or* all SANParks. If someone is *only* visiting Kruger National Park, they wouldn't benefit from the Wild Card, as they'd likely be cheaper paying the daily conservation and entry fees for Kruger alone.  The Wild Card is beneficial when visiting multiple parks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The Wild Card is *specifically* advantageous for visitors planning to visit many SANParks.
*   **C:** The Wild Card could *help* a budget-conscious visitor if they planned to visit multiple parks.
*   **D:** Visiting Kruger and one other park makes the Wild Card a potentially worthwhile purchase.



"
Isiphi isitatimende esingayichazi ngokunembile iKruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: IKruger National Park yaseNingizimu Afrika ingenane kunazo zonke.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the park is 19,500 km².** This doesn't imply it's the *smallest* park. It's a large park, in fact.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

* **A: Ibhekwa njengendawo eyinhloko ekhangayo eNingizimu Afrika** - The text says it's one of the most visited places in South Africa and the most well-known of the SANParks.
* **B: Ubuningi bezilwane zasendle phakathi nezindawo ezihlukahlukene** - The text states the park is divided into 14 ecosystems, each with different natural resources (implying diverse wildlife).
* **D: Kungena izivakashi ezithenge iWild Card** - The text explicitly mentions the Wild Card allows entry to the park.

Ikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kubangele ubungozi ngokuqwala indawo ephakeme yentaba?,"The correct answer is **A: Izimo zezulu lapho indawo imanzi** (Weather conditions when the area is wet).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...eziyingxenyeni ezehlelayo, ikakhulukazi lapho kumanzi, njengoba kungaba yingozi ngokushesha."" ( ""...particularly when wet, as it can quickly become dangerous."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukunyathela amatshe** (Stepping on stones): While the passage mentions stones, it doesn't say they're a hazard.  It says stones *line* the path.
*   **C: Imigede emincane** (Small holes): The passage mentions a small, narrow passage, but doesn't warn about holes.
*   **D: Intambo ezenziwe ngensimbi** (Steel cable): The steel cables are *for* safety - they are handrails to hold onto.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende esingakuvezi ngokunembile ukunyuka kwentaba yaseMachu Picchu njengoba kuchazwe endabeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ayikho indawo yokubambelela ezindaweni ezenyukelayo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zintambo zensimbi ziba uthango lokubambelelisa izandla"" (Steel cables act as handrails in the steeper sections). This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate according to the text:

*   **A: Ngisho nabaqwali abanesimo somzimba esihle bengaphelelwa umoya** - The passage states: ""Lindela ukuphelelwa umoya"" (Expect to get winded).
*   **C: Kudingeka udlule emgedeni iphezulu** - The passage states: ""Kunomhume omncane eduze nesiqongo okumelwe kudlulwe kuwo, usezansi kakhulu futhi uminyene."" (There is a small tunnel near the top that must be passed through, it is very low and narrow.)
*   **D: Indawo eyenyukelayo iba ingozi uma imanzi** - The passage states: ""uzi qaphele ezingxenyeni ezehlelayo, ikakhulukazi lapho kumanzi, njengoba kungaba yingozi ngokushesha."" (Be careful on the steeper sections, especially when wet, as it can become dangerous quickly.)



"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungesona isisekelo ekudleni kwamaMajorican?","The correct answer is **C: Ukolweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states Majorcan cuisine is based on *grain, vegetables, and meat*. While olive oil is *used* in the cuisine (and is a key part of Pa amb Oli), it's not a foundational ingredient in the same way as the other three. It's a component *with* those ingredients, not a core building block *of* the cuisine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inyama (Meat)** - Explicitly mentioned as a base.
*   **B: Isinkwa (Bread)** - Explicitly mentioned as a base (grain).
*   **D: Imifino (Vegetables)** - Explicitly mentioned as a base.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nokudla kwehangi okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Ihangi isebenzisa amatshe ashisayo ayatholakala eWellington**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Izindawo ezimbalwa e-Rotorua zinikela ngokudla okuphekwe ngokushisa komhlaba..."" (A few locations in Rotorua offer food cooked using geothermal heat...) and that hangi is also sometimes done in Christchurch and Wellington. However, it doesn't say the *stones* for the hangi are sourced from Wellington. It only says food is cooked there.
*   **The passage supports:**
    *   **A:** The first sentence explicitly states hangi is cooked in a pit heated by hot stones.
    *   **C:** The passage says ""I-hangi kaningi isetshenziselwa ukupheka ukudla kwakusihla okuthosiwe okungokwesiko."" (Hangi is often used to cook traditional preserved foods.)
    *   **D:** The passage mentions Rotorua as a place that offers food cooked with geothermal heat, implying the stones are available there.

Therefore, option B is the only statement not directly supported by the provided text."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubalwe njengendlela ejwayelekile yokushisisa umgodi ihangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Igesi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the hangi pit is heated by:

*   Hot stones from a fire
*   Geothermal heat (heat from beneath the earth)

It does *not* mention gas being used to heat the hangi. The option 'D: Amatshe ashisayo' is a duplicate of 'B: Amatshe ashisayo' and therefore not the correct answer.



"
Yini engaphumela ekuqashelweni ama-monk noma ama-nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukugqoka into egqamile yokuzimboza** (Wearing a conspicuous covering).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that bringing your own head covering, *especially* a brightly colored one, can lead to being stared at by monks or nuns. The other options are requirements *to avoid* being noticed negatively:

* **B: Ukumboza amahlombe** (Covering the shoulders) - This is a requirement for women.
* **C: Ukuboleka indwangu endlini yezindela** (Borrowing fabric at the entrance) - This is an option, but the passage suggests it might not be hygienic.
* **D: Ukugqoka isiketi esisikwe ngenhla kwedolo** (Wearing a skirt cut above the knee) - This is something women *shouldn't* do.



"
Yiziphi izingubo ezingase zingabi khona ukuze zibolekwe endlini yezindela? ,"The correct answer is **A: Iziketi**.

Here's why:

The text states that while monasteries often have shawls/wraps available, they are often ill-fitting. It *specifically* mentions bringing your own shawl, *especially a brightly colored one*, to avoid being given one by a male or female attendant. It also states you can borrow trousers, but suggests you might prefer to bring your own skirt for hygiene reasons (""this garment is not cleaned after each user"").

This implies that skirts are *not* reliably available for borrowing, unlike the shawls and trousers. Therefore, skirts are the item you might not find to borrow.



"
Kunini lapho isivakashi singaba khona namathuba amaningi okubuka izinkanyezi njengoba zivakashele izindawo yaseAtarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Phakathi nezinyanga zasebusika**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that during winter in the Arctic or Antarctic, you can experience nights longer than 24 hours, with the sun remaining below the horizon. This creates ideal conditions for seeing the aurora and enjoying stargazing due to the long periods of darkness and minimal light pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phakathi nezinyanga zasehlobo (During the summer months):** The passage describes conditions for *winter* viewing. Summer has extended daylight.
*   **B: Lapho indawo ingenabo abantu abaningi (When the area is sparsely populated):** While low population helps, the primary factor is the long hours of darkness in winter.
*   **D: Lapho amazinga alula okugcola ephansi (When levels of light pollution are low):** This is a contributing factor, but the main reason given is the prolonged darkness in winter."
Kunini lapho kungekona ukuhlakanipha ukusebenzisa ucingo lwesatellite kuneselula?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapho ulayini wesatellite ungase uvimbeke khona**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that a satellite phone needs a clear line of sight to the satellite to work. This means obstacles (like buildings, trees, or weather) can block the signal. The passage contrasts this with cell phones, which don't have this limitation *when a cellular network is available*. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uma indawo iceze kakhulu** - The passage doesn't mention weather impacting cell phone use.
*   **C: Uma izosetshenziswa ngaphandle** - Satellite phones are *designed* for outdoor use because of the need for a clear signal.
*   **D: Lapho uhambo luzodinga nibe nedata ethile** - The passage states satellite services are used for both data and voice, so this isn't a reason to *not* use one.



"
Lungafiseleka nini ucingo lwesatellite ukwedlula iselula?,"The correct answer is **B: Phakathi nokuhamba ngesikebhe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Isevisi isetshenziswa kaningi yimikhumbi..."" (The service is often used by ships...) This directly links satellite phones to marine environments.
* **Satellite phones are useful in remote areas:** The passage highlights their importance ""ezindaweni ezikude, ngaphandle kwenethiwekhi yefoni esebenzayo"" (in remote areas, without an active phone network).  Being on a ship often puts you in such a location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lapho uvakashele edolobheni (When visiting a city):** Cellular service is usually excellent in cities, making satellite phones unnecessary.
* **C: Lapho idata enganasidingo (When data isn't needed):** The passage mentions both voice *and* data needs being met by satellite phones.
* **D: Uma kuzokwenzeka ukuba ube nenethiwekhi ekahle yokushaya izincingo (If a good network for making calls is available):**  A good cellular network makes a satellite phone redundant.



"
Izinxabano ezilandelayo zobani ezaholela ekusungulweni iTransnistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubuzwe** (Ethnicity).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Moldova is a multiethnic republic plagued by ethnic tensions.""  These tensions, according to the passage, *led* to the declaration of independence for Transnistria. While economic factors might be involved, the root cause identified in the text is ethnic conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ezomnotho** (Economic) - The text says economic ties have been *re-established* but that political negotiations have failed. This doesn't mean economics caused the split.
*   **C: Ulimi** (Language) - While language is mentioned (Romanian and Russian are both used), it's not presented as the *cause* of the conflict.
*   **D: Inkolo** (Religion) - Religion isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo iTransnistria Republic enakho kodwa okuhlukile kunendawo yonke yaseMaldova?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Imali**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Transnistria Republic has ""its own government and *currency* but is not recognized by any UN member state."" The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Ulimi (Language)** - The passage says Russian is widely used in all of Moldova, not just Transnistria.
*   **B: Inkolo (Religion)** - The passage doesn’t mention religion.
*   **C: Ukuqashelwa yi-UN (UN recognition)** - The passage explicitly states that Transnistria is *not* recognized by any UN member state, and this is true for all of Moldova too.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isivakashi kufanele siyivakashele nini indawo yaseMontevideo uma sinethemba lokugwema izimo zezulu ezinomoya?","The correct answer is **B: Phakathi nesikhathi esomile saseMontevideo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that rainfall levels are *consistent throughout the year* in Montevideo. This means there isn't a distinct ""rainy season"".
* The question asks about avoiding *windy* conditions.  The passage explicitly mentions that while temperatures can drop below freezing in winter, the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder. 
* Therefore, a drier period would likely be less windy. While the text doesn't directly state a 'dry season' it implies consistent rainfall levels means avoiding any particularly wet/windy spells is best done during a generally consistent period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Phakathi nezinyanga zasebusika ZaseNyakatho Yezwe** - This would be summer in Montevideo, and the text says it's hot (over 30°C).  While not windy specifically mentioned, it's not focused on avoiding wind.
* **C: Phakathi nezinyanga zasehlobo ZaseNyakatho Yezwe** - This is winter in Montevideo, and the text directly states winter is when the wind makes it feel very cold.
* **D: Phakathi nezinyanga zaseMontevideo zasebusika** - This is, again, the season the text identifies as having wind and making it feel colder.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isivakashi kufanele sivakashele indawo yaseMontevideo uma zincamela izimo sezulu esipholile?","The correct answer is **D: Uma kuyisebusika Enyakatho Yezwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Montevideo experiences summer when the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter. Therefore, if a tourist wants cooler weather, they should visit Montevideo during the Northern Hemisphere's winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lapho kuyisehlobo eMontevideo:** This would be the hottest time to visit, not the coolest.
*   **B: Uma kuyisehlobo Enyakatho Yezwe:** This would be winter in Montevideo, so not the time for cool weather *in Montevideo*.
*   **C: Uma kuyisikhathi sezimvula eMontevideo:** The passage states rainfall is consistent year-round, so this doesn't guarantee cooler weather.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungahlotshaniswa nokumiswa kwabadweba izindonga, kunokuthi bacekela phansi indawo?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho kunemicimbi yokudweba** (When there are graffiti events).

Here's why:

The passage states that there are now ""independent graffiti experts, graffiti events and 'legal' walls."" This directly implies that graffiti is sometimes done *with* permission and in organized settings, rather than as illegal vandalism.  This is the opposite of ""vandalizing an area.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kube nezitolo** (There are stores) - This isn't directly related to the shift in perception of graffiti.
*   **C: Ukungavumeleki kwemidwebo ezindaweni zomphakathi** (The illegality of drawings in public places) - This actually *supports* the traditional negative view of graffiti, not the shift away from it.
*   **D: Omaka abangafundeki** (Unreadable marks) - While some graffiti might be hard to decipher, this doesn't indicate a move away from vandalism.

Yisiphi isici somculo abanye ababa khona kuwo abakubheka njengengxenye ebalulekile kulokho okusuke kwenzeka?,"The correct answer is **C: Umculo odlala kuze kube sebusuku**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...kungaba nezingxenye zomkhosi ezizoqhubeka zidlala umculo kuze kube sebusuku kakhulu."" and also states that many attendees see camping as a necessary part of the experience. This directly indicates that continuing music late into the night is considered an important aspect of the festival by many attendees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuletha ingane yakho (Bringing your child):** The text mentions family camping areas, but doesn't say bringing a child is seen as a key part of the overall festival experience for *everyone*.
*   **B: Ukukhempa endaweni (Camping at the site):** While the text mentions camping, it states this is important for getting a good viewing spot but not necessarily a key part of the music festival experience itself.
*   **D: Ukufika kusasenesikhathi (Arriving early):** The text suggests arriving early to secure a good camping spot, but this is a practical tip, not a core feature of the music experience.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okufanele bayibheke njengebalulekile abafika kule micimbi uma befuna ukukhempa eduzane nalapho kudlalwa khona umculo?","The correct answer is **D: Ukufika kusasenesikhathi (Arriving early)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Uma ufuna ukubona okwenzekayo useduze kuzomelwe ufike masinya ukuze uthole indawo yokukamisa eduze nomculo."" (If you want to see what's happening up close, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuhlala kuze kube sebusuku (Staying until late at night)** - While the text mentions music playing late, it doesn't say this is a key thing to *look for* when camping. It's a consequence of being there.
*   **B: Ukuhlala endaweni eseduze nemindeni (Staying in an area near families)** - The text mentions family camping areas exist, but doesn't say this is important for everyone.
*   **C: Ukukhempa ngaphandle kwendawo (Camping outside the area)** - The text focuses on camping *near* the music, not away from it.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi izivakashi okufanele zikugweme lapho zifuna indawo enobumnandi enyakatho neNew Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo zokuphuza edolobheni elincane**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Note: small-town bars here are generally not places for out-of-state visitors to hang out in."" This directly advises visitors to avoid these locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-Pueblos:** The text doesn't mention anything negative about Pueblos.
*   **C: Indawo enenxakathela yezitolo:** The text doesn't discuss shops or shopping areas.
*   **D: Indawo yokugembula:** The text indicates that many top-rated recreational areas *do* sell alcohol and offer entertainment, so they aren't what tourists should avoid.



"
"Ngokwa lendaba, kukuphi lapho emaningi amathuba okuba isivakashi sithole khona indawo eyaziwayo yobumnandi enyakatho neNew Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Endaweni yokugembula eseduze neSante Fe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that most of the highly-rated entertainment venues are associated with Albuquerque and Santa Fe. It specifically notes that the best options for visitors are likely to be found *in* or near these cities.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions Albuquerque, it doesn't suggest two-hour drive is a defining characteristic of finding entertainment.
* **B:** The passage doesn’t suggest Pueblos offer entertainment venues for visitors.
* **D:** The passage explicitly states that small-town bars are *not* good options for out-of-state visitors.



"
Izivakashi ezikhathazeke ngemali ezizoyisebenzisa zingase zifune ukugwema luphi uhlobo lweziphuzo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ijusi yezithelo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iziphuzo ezenziwe ngezithelo ziyabiza kodwa zikahle kakhulu."" This directly indicates that fruit juices are expensive, making them a less appealing option for budget-conscious travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iwayini lase-Australia:** The text suggests New Zealand and Australian wines are good, not necessarily expensive.
*   **B: Amanzi asemabhodleleni:** The text says bottled water is readily available if you're concerned about tap water, implying it's a safe (though perhaps not explicitly cheap) option.
*   **C: Ubhiya wendawo:** The text describes a local beer (""Uhamba Phambili"") as enjoyable and bubbly, without mentioning its price."
"Ngokwale ndawo echazwe kule ndaba, yibuphi utshwala obungase buphambaniswe umuntu odayisayo?","The correct answer is **C: Sauvignon Blanc yaseNew Zealand**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""There are many French wines drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better."" This suggests Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand is a specific type of wine a seller might offer, and that it's a good option due to its ability to ""travel"" (meaning hold up well in transport/storage).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I-short black** - The text discusses espresso, which is similar, but doesn't suggest a seller would specifically highlight a ""short black"".
*   **B: I-Number One** - This refers to ""Uhamba Phambili"" which is home-brewed beer - not something a general seller would likely offer.
*   **D: I-Flat White** - This isn't mentioned in the text. The text speaks of espresso and cappuccino.



"
"Njengoba lahlala amakhulu weminyaka amathathu, isikhathi samakholoni saqalwa yiliphi iqembu?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""AbaseSpeyini baqala isikhathi sobukoloni esathatha amakhulu amathathu eminyaka."" (The Spaniards began the colonial period that lasted three centuries.)

The other options are indigenous groups mentioned as existing *before* or *during* the colonial period, but they didn't *begin* it.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indlela enhle kakhulu yokwenza umuntu waseFrance afudumale?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuba nenhlonipho (To be respectful)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that living well in Paris requires behaving properly and acting like a ""bien élevé"" (well-raised) person. This directly translates to showing good manners and respect. While the passage mentions a perceived ""rudeness"" among Parisians, it argues this disappears quickly with basic good etiquette.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Ukuzama ukulingisa isimo sengqondo somuntu waseFrance (Trying to mimic the French mindset)** - While understanding the culture is helpful, the passage emphasizes *behavior*, not mimicking a specific mindset.
*   **B: Ukubonisa ukuzethemba (Showing confidence)** - Confidence isn't mentioned as a key to good interaction.
*   **D: Ukubonisa isimo sokuthanda ukuxhumana nabantu (Showing a sociable attitude)** - While friendliness is generally good, the core message of the passage is about *respectful* behavior, not just being sociable.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuyinto eshiwo abanye enganembile ngabantu basePherisi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuba luhlaza**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abantu basePherisi banedumela lokuqhosha, ukuba luhlaza kanye nokuzidla. Nakuba lokhu kaningi kuyinto eshiwo abanye enganembile...""  This directly translates to: ""People from Paris have a reputation for snobbery, being rude, and gluttony. Although this is often something said by others that is inaccurate..."" 

Therefore, being rude (""ukuba luhlaza"") is the reputation that the passage identifies as often being inaccurate."
Iyiphi inzuzo yokugibela iFirst Class kuyiMetroRail yaseKapa?,"The correct answer is **B: Alinabo abantu abaningi**.

Here's why:

The text states ""iMetroPlus inethezeke kakhudlwana futhi ayigcwali abantu kodwa ibiza kakhudlwana..."" which translates to ""MetroPlus is more comfortable and is less crowded but costs more..."".  MetroPlus is essentially the first class option, and the key benefit mentioned is the lack of crowding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Igumbi lingaphambili kwesitimela (A compartment at the front of the train)** - The text doesn't mention compartment location.
*   **C: Lishibhe kancane kunethikithi leThird Class (It is cheaper than a Third Class ticket)** - The text states it *costs more* than the regular (Metro/Third Class) ticket.
*   **D: Liyinani lemali efanayo nethikithi leMetro (It costs the same as a Metro ticket)** - The text specifically says it costs *more* than the Metro ticket."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ekhona ezitimeleni zaseKapa ezithatha abantu abasebenzayo?","The correct answer is **D: Amagumbi womabili eFirst Class neThird Class**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""IMetroRail inezigaba ezimbili zezitimela zabagibeli... iMetroPlus (ebuye ibizwe ngokuthi Isigaba Esiphezulu) kanye neMetro (ebizwa ngeSigaba Sesithathu).""  This directly translates to two classes: a ""higher class"" (MetroPlus) and a ""third class"" (Metro).  These are functionally equivalent to first and third class, or higher/lower comfort levels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Igumbi leMetro aligcwali kakhulu:** While the passage says MetroPlus isn't crowded, it doesn't say anything about Metro *not* being crowded.
* **B: Ithikithi elifanayo lamakilasi womabili:** The passage explicitly states MetroPlus *costs more* than Metro.
* **C: Amakilasi amathathu angefani:** The passage only mentions *two* classes, not three.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo amagciwane ezilwane okungabonakali ukuthi engakwenza?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukubangela amashashaza (Causing blemishes)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the dangers animals can pose related to **illness and injury**. It specifically mentions:

*   Contaminating food
*   Causing illness (spreading pathogens/disease)
*   Physical harm/attack (though it says this is less common)

The passage *doesn't* mention animals causing blemishes or cosmetic issues. The other options are all directly related to the dangers described in the text:

*   **B: Ukuvukelwa yizigulo ezingakuphathi kahle (Being infected with unmanageable illnesses)** - The passage directly discusses animals spreading disease.
*   **C: Ukusabalala kokutheleleka (Spread of infection)** - Similar to B, disease transmission is a key point.
*   **D: Ukubangela ukulimala (Causing injury)** - The passage mentions animals harming or killing people, although it states this is rare.



"
Engathengwa kuphi amakhadi okufona akhokhelwayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezitolo ezisemakhoneni** (Convenience stores).

Here's why:

The passage states that these cards are filled with ""a variety of prepaid phone cards"".  Convenience stores (ezitolo ezisemakhoneni) are common places to find a wide variety of prepaid items like phone cards. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Emazweni aqondile** (Direct countries) - This doesn't make sense as a place to *buy* the cards.
* **B: Emahhovisini ezitimela** (Train stations) - While possible, they aren't the *primary* retail location for these cards.
* **D: Endaweni okukhokhelwa kuyo amafoni** (Phone payment locations) - This is too general and doesn't specify a store type.



"
Yiziphi ezinye izinzuzo ezingcono ezinikezwa kulamakhadi?,"The best answer is **B: Ngokusebenzisa inombolo yamahhala** (By using a toll-free number).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that access to these services is often available through toll-free numbers that can be dialed from many phones without charge.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Ungakwazi ukulisebenzisa emazweni aqondile** (You can use it in specific countries) - The passage mentions some cards are designed for lower rates to *certain* countries, but doesn't highlight this as a general benefit.
*   **C: Ezitolo ezisemakhoneni** (Corner stores) - The passage discusses *where* the cards are found (small shops), not a *benefit* of the cards themselves.
*   **D: Ngokusebenzisa ifoni ekhokhelwayo nokukhokhela izindleko ezengeziwe** (By using a paid phone and paying additional costs) - This contradicts the idea of using prepaid cards to *avoid* higher costs.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izihlahla ezilandelayo ayivamile kwipaki ezilwane ePlitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Isihlahla se-okhi (Oak tree)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the park is *mainly* filled with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and includes a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean plants. Oak trees are *not* mentioned as being present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isihlahla i-beech (Beech tree):** The passage states beech trees are a primary type of tree in the park.
*   **C: Isihlahla somsayipuresi (Spruce tree):**  The passage states spruce trees are a primary type of tree in the park.
*   **D: Isihlahla i-spruce (Spruce tree):**  The passage states spruce trees are a primary type of tree in the park.



"
Iziphi izilwane ezingandile ezilandelayo ongazithola esiqiwini esisePlitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Capercaillie**.

The passage specifically mentions ""capercaillie"" as one of the many animal species found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ITurkey:** While turkeys exist, they aren't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: I-Honey Badger:** Honey badgers are not native to this region.
*   **C: I-Cassowary:** Cassowaries are found in Australia and New Guinea, not Europe."
"Ngokwale ndaba, amakhodi esifunda asiza ngani kahle kahle?","The correct answer is **C: Ukugwema ukukopisha ngokungafanele (To avoid improper copying)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that regional codes ""don't work at all in preventing illegal copying."" The author claims the *stated* reason for these codes (""preventing leaks"") is a lie. They argue the *real* reason is market control and profit.  Therefore, the codes are *intended* to avoid improper copying, even though they are ineffective at doing so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukukopisha idisk (Copying a disk):**  The passage says codes *fail* to prevent copying.
*   **B: Ukuqondisa ezokudayisa (Directing sales):** While the author believes market control is the *result* of the codes, it's not what the codes are *for* in theory.
*   **D: Ukukopisha okungekho emthethweni (Illegal copying):**  The passage explicitly states the codes don't stop illegal copying.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungamanga ngokuphathelene namakhodi esifundsa abhebhezelwa izinkampani zabezindaba?","The correct answer is **B: Kusiza ekugwemeni ukukopisha okungemthetho**.

Here's why:

The passage *directly contradicts* the claim that copy protection (codes) helps prevent illegal copying. It states: ""Empeleni, amakhodi wendawo awasebenzi nakancane ekukopeni okungekho emthethweni…"" (""In reality, regional codes do absolutely nothing to stop illegal copying…"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuyadingeka ukuze kutholakale ukuqondisa okukhulu kokudayisa** – The passage doesn’t mention anything about marketing strategies.
*   **C: Kuyasiza ekutholeni imali eningi** – While the passage argues the *ultimate goal* is profit, it claims the codes don’t achieve this by preventing copying, but by controlling the market.
*   **D: Kukancane kusize ekugwemeni ukukophisha ngokungafanele** - The passage states it doesn't help *at all*.

Therefore, the statement that copy protection helps prevent illegal copying is the one the passage identifies as false."
"Lapho ufika nedaweni yakini, iyiphi inqubo ngokujwayelekile engekho ngokomthetho?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlolwa kwabantu abathuthela kwelinye izwe (Immigration checks)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically discusses immigration checks upon arrival in a new country and the difficulties of navigating those checks. It emphasizes knowing what you can and cannot bring and declaring items to authorities. This directly relates to the process of being checked as an immigrant/new arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izinto oziphethe okufanele uziveze (Items you must declare):** While mentioned *within* the context of immigration checks, it's not the process itself.
* **C: Inani elikaliwe lezinto okufanele uziphathe ngokomthetho (Allowed quantity of items):** This is a detail *within* the regulations of immigration checks, not the process itself.
* **D: Isikhungo esiqondisa abafikayo (Facility guiding arrivals):**  The passage doesn't mention a specific facility; it focuses on the *checking* process.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okufanele ukwazi ngaphambi kokuba ufike ezweni lakini?,"The correct answer is **B: Uma kudingeka uveze ezinye izinto oziphethe ukubheka ukuthi azeqile yini enanini elingokomthetho** (Whether you need to declare items you are carrying and check if they exceed the legal limits).

Here's why:

The original statement (P) specifically emphasizes the difficulty of going *through* customs and the importance of knowing what you can and cannot bring, and declaring everything to authorities.  Option B directly addresses this point – needing to declare goods and ensuring they comply with legal limits.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant to the immediate point being made:

*   **A:** While knowing if there *is* an immigration check is helpful, the statement focuses on navigating that check.
*   **C:** A guidance center is useful, but doesn't address the core issue of customs regulations.
*   **D:** Knowing what's prohibited is part of the overall picture, but the statement is specifically about the process of inspection and declaring items.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubuningi bani obuvumela abaqwalayo ukuba baqhubeke bethola izindlela ezintsha phakathi neCochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **D: Izindonga** (Walls).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...continues to discover new routes *among the endless walls* that are cliffs.""  This directly links the ability to find new routes to the presence of the walls themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indawo ebukwayo** (Viewpoint): While viewpoints exist in the valley, they don't *allow* climbers to discover routes.
*   **B: Isiqongo sentaba** (Mountain peak): The text mentions peaks having good views, but doesn't say they facilitate route discovery.
*   **C: Phezulu kwentaba** (Top of the mountain): Similar to the peak, being on top doesn't create the opportunity for finding new routes.



"
"Ngokokwaziswa okunikezwe kule ndaba, obani abakwazi ukuhamba kakhulu baklaye eNingizimu Yezwe?","The correct answer is **B: I-Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""The Star Alliance covers everything except the Eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a one-nation escape for LATAM.""
* This means the Star Alliance covers travel routes across all other major oceans *except* a specific part of the South Pacific.  This makes it the organization with the most comprehensive coverage globally, as described in the prompt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: SkyTeam:** The text states SkyTeam doesn't cover all three ways to cross major southern and northern oceans.
* **C: South Pacific:** The South Pacific is a *location*, not an airline alliance.
* **D: LATAM Oneworld:** LATAM's reach is limited to the specific South Pacific route mentioned, and not the global coverage described in the prompt.



"
Imuphi umfelandawonye wamabhanoyi ohamba indawo encane olwandle uklaye iNingizimu Yezwe?,"The correct answer is **A: I-Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""The Star Alliance covers everything except for the Eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM OneWorld escape route."" This means the Star Alliance is the alliance that covers the most territory, including the smaller area of ocean you are asking about, excluding that specific LATAM route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: INingizimu yePacific** – This is a geographical location, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: ILATAM Oneworld** – The passage specifically states that the route from Santiago to Tahiti is a ""LATAM OneWorld escape route"" - meaning it’s *not* covered by Star Alliance.
*   **D: I-SkyTeam** – The passage mentions that SkyTeam doesn’t cover all transoceanic routes."
Iyiphi inhlangano ebukisa abantu indawo eyalandela iGlobal Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I-Go Running Tours eyalandela i-Global Running Tours iqondisa izinkampani zezingosi emazwekazini amane."" This directly translates to ""Go Running Tours, following Global Running Tours, directs tour companies in four countries.""

The other options are mentioned as *part* of the network Go Running Tours built (Barcelona, Copenhagen, Prague), but Go Running Tours is the organization that *follows* and directs them.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iGo Running Tour yasiza ekuxhumaniseni izinhlangano ezibuka indawo ezingaki?","The correct answer is **A: Ezine** (Four).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I-Go Running Tours eyalandela i-Global Running Tours iqondisa izinkampani zezingosi emazwekazini amane."" This translates to: ""Go Running Tours, following Global Running Tours, directs tour companies in four countries."" 

The passage specifically mentions Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague, and then states ""and others,"" implying there's a fourth country involved. Therefore, the answer is four."
Yini isivakashi okufanele sikwenze uma sinethemba lokubona ngokucacile isilwane ingulele?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebenzisa izipopolo** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amabhubesi, izingulule kanye nezingwe ziyexwaya futhi uzozibona kangcono ngezingilazi zokubuka kude."" (Lions, hyenas and leopards are shy and you will see them better with binoculars).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hamba uyoqwala kuyisafari** (Go on a safari) - While generally true, it doesn't specifically address *how* to see a leopard clearly.
*   **B: Hamba ehlathini** (Go for a walk in the forest) - The passage mentions walking safaris, but doesn't suggest it's the best way to see shy animals like leopards.
*   **D: Thatha imoto bese usebenzisa amathuluzi afanele** (Take a car and use the appropriate tools) - While a car is part of a safari, the passage specifically highlights binoculars for viewing shy animals.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isilwane isivakashi okungenzeka sihlangane naso phakathi nokuvakasha kuyisafari ngemoto?","The correct answer is **B: Izindlulamithi**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Ezinye izilwane, njengezindlovu kanye nezindlulamithi, zithanda ukusondela ezimotweni..."" (Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach the vehicles...).

While lions, leopards, and hyenas are mentioned, the text says you'll see them *better* with binoculars, implying they don't necessarily come close to the vehicles. Giraffes are specifically said to approach vehicles.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini enganciphisa izindleko zokubona indawo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuthola iqembu labantu abazobuka indawo** (Finding a group of people to visit the place with).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukuvakasha kushibhile emaqenjini amakhulu, ngakho uma uzimele noma unomngane oyedwa, zama ukuhlangana nabanye abantu ukuze nakhe iqembu labantu abane noma abasithupha ukuze nithole amanani aphansi omuntu oyedwa.""  This directly translates to: ""Traveling in large groups is cheaper, so if you are alone or with one friend, try to meet other people to form a group of four or six people to get lower per-person prices.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuhamba wedwa** (Traveling alone) - The passage implies this is *more* expensive.
* **C: Ukuhamba nomunye umuntu** (Traveling with one person) -  The passage states you should find *more* people to get lower rates.
* **D: Ukuthola iqembu labantu abayizithupha noma ngaphezulu** (Finding a group of ten or more people) - While a larger group could be even cheaper, the passage specifically suggests 4-6 people as a good target.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase athola amanani amahle okubuka indawo?","The correct answer is **A: Izivakashi ezizimisele ukuhambisana emotweni** (Tourists willing to share a ride).

Here's why:

The passage states that tour operators often move people around to fill vehicles, *appearing* to pressure people into paying more. However, the advice is to **form a group of 4-6 people to get lower individual prices**.  Those who are willing to join existing rides (share a vehicle) are the ones who will benefit from these lower prices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iqembu labantu abathathu (A group of three people):** While a group is good, 3 is less ideal than the recommended 4-6 for getting the best rates.
* **C: Abangane ababili abahamba ndawonye (Two friends traveling together):**  Two people is too small to get the group discount.
* **D: Iqembu labantu abahlanu (A group of five people):** This *would* get a good rate, but the passage specifically highlights those willing to *join* groups if they're traveling solo or as a pair.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yini eyaba nesandla ekuqashelweni kwendawo yaseSan Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuba khona kwezinto njalo ezihlukahlukene zobuciko nezabezindaba** (The presence of various artistic and media representations).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ukubukiswa kwalo njalo emculweni, kumafilimu, ezincwadini kanye nasemasikweni athandwayo kwenze idolobha kanye nezici ezibonwa ngalo izwe zaziwe emhlabeni wonke."" This directly translates to ""Its constant portrayal in music, movies, books and popular culture has made the city and its iconic features known worldwide.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izindawo eziphezulu zemihlangano** (Top meeting venues) - While the city *has* these, the text doesn't say they contribute to its global recognition.
* **C: Ukwehlukahluka kwezomnotho** (Economic diversity) - The text mentions economic diversity, but it doesn't say this is *why* it's famous.
* **D: Ukukhangiswa kwakhona ngokudla kwase-Asia** (Promotion of Asian cuisine) - This is a feature *of* San Francisco, but not the primary reason for its worldwide fame.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana neSan Francisco esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Ezomnotho sezizonke zincike kakhulu ezivakashini**.

Here's why:

The passage states that San Francisco's economy is a *mixture* of tech, government, finance, trade, and tourism. It doesn't say tourism is the *dominant* or primary factor. While tourism is important, the text highlights the significance of other sectors like technology.

Let's look at why the other options are true, based on the text:

*   **A: Isifakwe kakhulu kumamuvi kanye nasezincwadini** – The passage explicitly says it's ""regularly featured in music, movies, books and popular culture.""
*   **B: Kwandile ukudla kwase-Asia okuhlotshisiwe** – The text states it is “one of the best places in the country for eating several Asian dishes: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.”
*   **C: Maningi amahhotela kanye nezikhungo zemihlangano** – The passage mentions it's surrounded by ""large tourist attractions with many hotels, restaurants, and high-quality conference facilities.""



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, izivakashi ezinjani ezingase zingazuzi ekusebenziseni izinkonzo zama-ejenti?","The correct answer is **C: Isivakashi esingakayitholi ivisa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel agencies can ""hold a place for you if you need time to think or still need to sort out things related to your trip (for example a visa).""  This directly indicates that someone needing a visa would benefit from using a travel agency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isivakashi esimanqikanqika (An indecisive traveler):** While the agency *can* hold a place, the passage doesn't emphasize assisting indecisive travelers specifically.  It's more about logistical issues like visas.
* **B: Isivakashi esithanda ukuzenzela izinto (A traveler who likes to do things themselves):** The passage describes benefits of *using* an agency. Someone who likes to DIY wouldn't benefit.
* **D: Isivakashi esikhetha ukubhukha izindali eziyisamba (A traveler who prefers booking separate items):**  The agency offers packages, so someone wanting to book everything individually wouldn't find their services useful.

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungashiwongo endabeni njengenzuzo yokubhuka usebenzisa ama-ejenti okuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukusheshisa amadokhuyumenti okuvakasha (Expediting travel documents)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on the benefits of booking through travel agencies like peace of mind knowing accommodation is secured, discounts, bundled packages (flights/hotel/transport), and holding a space for you while you finalize details. 
*   While travel agents *can* assist with travel documents (like visas), the passage does **not** specifically mention speeding up the document process as a benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the text:

*   **B: Imititilizo yamahhotela (Hotel incentives/discounts):** The passage explicitly states companies often have discounts with certain hotels.
*   **C: Amaphakheji ahlanganisa yonke into (All-inclusive packages):**  The text mentions packages combining flights, hotels, and transport.
*   **D: Ukubekisa isikhala sakho (Reserving your space):** The passage says they can hold a space for you while you decide.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yini izicelo zabahumushi abahumusha ngaso leso sikhathi abangakwazi ukuyenza?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuhumusha izinto ezibhaliwe ezintweni ezifana namafoni** (Translating written text on things like phones).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that some real-time translation apps can translate text *from* things in the real world when pointed at with a smartphone camera.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuhumusha izimpawu zakwamanye amazwe** (Translating foreign signs) - While this *could* be done with the app, it's not specifically highlighted as a key capability in the passage.
* **B: Ukuhumusha yonke imibhalo yendaba** (Translating all news articles) -  The passage mentions translation of text generally, but doesn't focus on news articles specifically.
* **D: Ukuhumusha ngokunembe ngamaphesenti angu-100 ngaso sonke isikhathi** (Translating with 100% accuracy all the time) - The passage explicitly states that these apps are *not* always perfectly accurate.



"
Yini evumela ukuba ukuhumushwa kwento kungenziwa ku-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukudawuniloda idatha yolimi** (Downloading language data).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""Izinhlelo zokusebenza ezihamba phambili kulesi sigaba yi-Guguli Humusha, evumela ukuhumusha ngaphandle kwe-inthanethi ngemva kokudawuniloda idatha yolimi olufunwayo."" (One of the leading applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows translation without the internet after downloading the desired language data).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Izinto zokuhumusha ezithuthukisiwe** (Improved translation tools) - This is too general. The *how* is what's being asked.
* **B: Amafoni esimanje** (Modern phones) - While modern phones are needed to *use* the app, they don't enable offline translation themselves.
* **D: Izicelo zokuhumusha izinto ngaso leso sikhathi** (Real-time object translation applications) -  This describes the *type* of application, not what makes offline translation possible.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasusi ukuwa kwamaqhwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Iqhwa elinamathelayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ice *needs to be disturbed* to fall because it adheres (sticks).  Therefore, ice that is adhering is what *prevents* it from falling, not what causes it. The passage explicitly states that clinging ice is the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Abantu** - The passage directly states that people can cause icicles to fall (""often a person"").
*   **C: Ilanga** - The passage mentions the sun as a trigger for icicle falls.
*   **D: Ukuwa kwamanye amaqhwa** - The passage states that falling ice can cause other ice to fall.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwehla njengeqhwa eliwayo?","The correct answer is **C: Umthamo omkhulu weqhwa endaweni ewumqansa** (A large volume of ice in a sloped area).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""added ice will fall as an ice spike.""  This implies that a *significant amount* of ice accumulating on a slope is what leads to the formation of ice spikes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iqhwa elinamfukayo elingaphazanyiswanga** (Untouched dripping ice) - The passage states ice needs to be *disturbed* to fall, so untouched ice wouldn't form a spike.
*   **B: Indawo ewumqansa kodwa engenalo iqhwa** (A sloped area but without ice) - There needs to be ice present to form a spike.
*   **D: Iqhwa elishiywe lingathintwanga abantu** (Ice left untouched by people) - As mentioned before, the passage states ice needs to be *disturbed* to fall, so untouched ice wouldn't form a spike.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukhari usekelwe kuziphi izithako?","The correct answer is **B: Emakhambini kanye nezinongo**.

The text states: ""Ukhari yisidlo esisuselwa **kumakhambi nezinongo**..."" (Ukhari is a dish based on **grains and legumes**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iyogathi namanzi** - While yogurt and water *can* be used, they aren't the base ingredients.
*   **C: Obisini lukakhukhunathi nenyama** - Coconut milk and meat are sometimes added, but not the foundation.
*   **D: Kuyimifino nobisi** - Vegetables and milk are also sometimes added, but aren't the base.



"
"Ezifundeni ezithile, ubisi lwekhukhunathi ngezinye izikhathi lusetshenziswa esikhundleni sasiphi isithako sikakhari?","The correct answer is **C: Iyogathi**.

The passage states: ""in the central and northern parts of the country and in India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in the South and India and in some coastal areas of the country, coconut milk is often used."" This means coconut milk is often used *instead* of yogurt. The question asks what is used instead of a curry ingredient, and coconut milk is described as a substitute for yogurt, which is used *in* curries.



"
Kungani ukuphambuka eTransantarctic Mountains kudinga ukuba uye ethafeni?,"The correct answer is **C: Imishini ekhethekile ayikwazi ukuhamba kahle**.

Here's why:

The text states that the South Pole Traverse is difficult and requires specialized equipment (snowmobiles, tracked vehicles, etc.).  It also says the route *detours around* the Transantarctic Mountains to avoid steep terrain. This implies the specialized equipment isn't suited for traversing those mountains directly – it needs a more gradual, less steep route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isiteshi iMcMurdo sivame ukuvalwa:**  While McMurdo Station might close sometimes, this doesn’t explain why the *route* needs to detour.
* **B: Iqhwa elihlangene livame ukuba yingozi:** The text states the route is *on* the ice shelf, and while it's challenging, danger isn’t the specific reason for the detour.
* **D: Kulula kunokuhamba usebenzise iRoss Sea:**  The passage doesn't compare the difficulty of different routes, only that the traverse goes around the mountains.



"
"NgaseSouth Pole Traverse, yini emakwe ngamafulege?","The correct answer is **C: Imisele evulekile egcwele iqhwa**.

The text states: ""Kuyiqhwa elihlangene eligcwele imisele ebekiswe ngamafulegi."" This directly translates to ""It is a consolidated ice sheet full of crevasses marked by flags.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Indlela eya eSiteshini saseMcMurdo** - The traverse *starts* at McMurdo Station, it doesn't mark the route *to* it.
*   **B: Imishini ethwala uphethiloli** - While supplies are carried along the traverse, the flags mark the crevasses, not the machines.
*   **D: Kuyingozi ukuphambukela ezintabeni** - This is a statement about why the route is taken, not what is marked by flags.



"
Yini engazange ivezwe endabeni njengento izivakashi okufanele zikuqaphele lapho sibuka indawo yaseNingizimu Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Amazwe amaningi anemithetho ehlukahlukene ngokuphathelene nama-Visa**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Izimfuneko ze-visa nezindleko kuyahluka emazweni ngamazwe futhi kuthonywa yizwe ovela kulo."" (Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country and are determined by your country of origin). This is a critical detail for tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage *does* mention traveling by car is a good way to visit off-the-beaten-path locations.
* **C:** The passage states ""nakuba i-Afrika eseNingizimu igxilile akuwona wonke amazwe angomakhelwane anjalo."" (although South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are the same).
* **D:** The passage *recommends* a 4x4 vehicle, but doesn't present it as something tourists *must* be aware of – it's a helpful tip.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engabhekwa njengeseluleko esibi ezivakashini ezifuna ukuhlola iNingizimu Afrika zisebenzisa imoto?","The correct answer is **A: Ezinye izinto zezimo eziphuthumayo zingase zidingwe umthetho**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Izwe ngalinye libuye libe nemithetho ehlukile edinga okumelwe kube yizinto zesimo esiphuthumayo okumelwe zibe semotweni."" This means failing to check and have the required emergency items can get you into trouble. This is a *negative* consequence, making it bad advice to ignore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage *supports* this statement - it says a regular car is possible with careful planning.
* **C:** The passage *supports* this statement - it says it's a great way to see less-traveled areas.
* **D:** While true (the passage mentions neighboring countries aren't always as safe), it's a general observation, not necessarily ""bad advice"" *specifically related to driving*.  The main problem is not *whether* to visit those countries, but to understand the specific requirements for each.

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kushiwo kule ndaba ngokuphathelene nobungozi bokushiya isikhwama sakho singagadiwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Zingase ziphanjaniswe nezomunye umuntu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the following dangers of unattended luggage:
    *   **A: Zingase zebiwe** - The passage mentions bags being easily targeted for theft.
    *   **B: Ungazi ungase ufakelwe izidakamizwa esikhwameni** - The passage warns about being used as a drug mule without your knowledge.
    *   **D: Abezomthetho bengazibheka njengento engaba ibhomu** - The passage states unattended bags can attract attention from authorities suspecting bombs.

*   The passage **does not** mention the risk of your luggage being confused with someone else's.

Therefore, option C is the only danger *not* mentioned in the text."
Yini engazange ishiwo endabeni mayelana nokuphatha izidakamizwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwamanye amazwe, abantu abaphula umthetho okokuqala bengase bathole isigwebo sokufa.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Amanye amazwe anezindlela zokujezisa ezinonya kakhulu ngisho nakubantu abaqalayo ukuphula umthetho; lezi zingahlanganisa izigwebo zasejele zeminyaka engaphezu kuka-10 noma ukufa.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuqapha okwengeziwe kufanele kuthathwe lapho uvakashela elinye izwe** - While implied, it's not a *specific* detail mentioned about drug laws.  It's general travel advice.
* **C: Izinja ezihlola izidakamizwa zingasebenzisa ngaphandle kokuthi wena wazi** - This *is* stated in the passage (""izinja ezithungatha izidakamizwa zingasetshenziswa nganoma isiphi isikhathi ngaphandle kwesaziso"").  So it *was* mentioned.
* **D: Iziphathimandla zingase zibambe isikhwama sakho ngisho noma izidakamizwa ungaziphethe** -  This is also stated in the passage (""izikhwama ezinganakwanga zitshontshwa kalula futhi zingadonsa ukunaka kweziphathimandla""). So it *was* mentioned.



"
Yiluphi uhlobo lukatshwala olungazange lubalwe njengento ongazama ukuzenzela yona ekhaya uma uhlezi uphumule?,"The correct answer is **C: Ubhiya (Beer)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage suggests making **juice (A)** and **smoothies with fruit (related to juice)** at home when relaxing.
*   It specifically mentions enjoying **coffee (B)** in the morning and **tea (D)** at night.
*   However, the passage doesn't suggest *making* beer at home. It mentions trying *different drinks* at local pubs/bars - implying buying it, not brewing it.

Therefore, beer is the only option not presented as something to create yourself while relaxing."
Yikuphi okulandelayo okufanele ukuvakashele phakathi nesikhathi sokuhlala ekhaya uma idolobha okulo laziwa ngenxa yeziphuzo ezenziwa khona?,"The correct answer is **C: Izindawo zokuphuza ongajwayele ukuya kuzo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Uma uhlala edolobheni elinesiko lokuphuza elihlukile, yana ezinkantinini noma izindlini zokuphuzela emiphakathini ongavamisanga ukuya kuyo."" (If you live in a city known for a unique drinking culture, go to cafes or bars in communities you don't usually go to).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While coffee shops are mentioned, the passage doesn't suggest visiting one *specifically* for a staycation.
*   **B:** Juices and smoothies are mentioned as a fun activity to *make* at home, not a place to visit.
*   **D:** Chamomile tea is suggested for relaxing at home, not a place to specifically visit.



"
Izithombe zamajuba zikuphi nendawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Emagcekeni esonto** (On the corners of the church).

The text states: ""Egcekeni lesonto, kunemifanekiso yemabula ethakazelisayo yamajuba phezu kwamathuna amanye."" which translates to ""On the corners of the church, there are fascinating depictions of bulls above some tombs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isikhathi esingaba yingxenye yehora uma usuka esigodini** (A time of about an hour from the valley) - This refers to the walking time, not the location of the images.
*   **C: Esiqhingini sase-Eysturoy** (On the island of Eysturoy) - The church is *viewing* the island, it's not *on* the island.
*   **D: Ngaphakathi esontweni** (Inside the church) - The text specifically states the images are on the *corners* of the church, implying the exterior.



"
Yiluphi uhlobo lwe-visa olungase ludingwe umuntu ukuze aveze uvufakazi ukuthi unemali eyanele ukuzisekela?,"The correct answer is **D: Ivisa yabafundi** (Student visa).

The passage specifically states: ""Amavisa wabafundi afuna izinto ezihlukahlukene...kanye nobufakazi bemali yokuziphilisa okungenani unyaka wokuqala wesifundo sakho.""  This means a student visa requires proof of financial support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ivisa yebhizinisi** (Business visa) - The passage doesn't mention financial proof as a requirement for a business visa.
* **B: Ivisa yezivakashi** (Tourist visa) - The passage states tourist visas have different requirements than student visas and doesn't mention financial proof specifically.
* **C: Ivisa yesikhashana** (Short-term visa) - This is a general term and the passage doesn't link financial proof to this type of visa.



"
Ubani ongase adinge ukwenezela isikhathi kuyivisa yakhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfundi ofunda phesheya**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that students studying abroad generally need to stay for longer periods and therefore require visas that are different from those for regular visitors or business travelers. It highlights the need for things like acceptance letters and proof of funds for the *entire* duration of their studies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isivakashi esifika njalo (A frequent visitor):** The passage doesn't mention frequent visitors needing to extend visas.
*   **B: Isivakashi esifika ngezikhathi ezithile (An occasional visitor):** This is simply a typical visitor, and the passage states they have different visa requirements than students.
*   **D: Isivakashi esize ngezamabhizinisi (A business visitor):** The passage states business visas are different from student visas, but doesn't imply they need extensions."
Kunini lapho kufanele uqaphele khona omiyane?,"The correct answer is **C: Ehlathini lemvula**.

The passage specifically states you should be careful of snakes *when you go into the rainforest* (""uma unquma ukuhamba ehlathini lemvula""). The example given is about entering a rainforest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phakathi nezinyanga zasehlobo** - The passage doesn't mention seasons.
*   **B: Lapho uyoqwala** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Lapho ushayela** - While the example *includes* driving, the warning is about being in the rainforest, not just driving near it.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okufanele uyigweme ukuyenza ukuze ugweme umiyane lapho ushayela ehlathini elimanzi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukushiya izicabha zemoto zivulwe isikhathi eside** (Leaving the car windows open for a long time).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that even a few moments with the windows open is enough for snakes to enter the car. Therefore, avoiding leaving the windows open for extended periods is the key to preventing snakes from getting in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukushayela phakathi nesikhathi sasehlobo** (Driving during the summer) - The time of year isn't directly linked to the snake problem in the passage.
* **C: Ukushayela endaweni engasolwandle** (Driving in a non-coastal area) -  The passage focuses on rainforests, not coastal areas.
* **D: Ukushiya imoto yakho ingagadiwe kuyilapho usayoqwala izindawo** (Leaving your car unattended while you wander around) - While leaving your car unattended can be risky in general, the passage specifically warns about the *windows being open* and snakes entering the car.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo mayelana neSundarbans okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Uhhafu wayo yonke indawo umbozwe ixhaphozi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that one-third of the Sundarbans is covered by water/aquatic areas, not half. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the passage:

*   **A: Izici zasendle ezinkulu okungenzeka zisasele** - The passage mentions it holds ""one of the last refuges for the Ganges tidal forests.""
*   **C: Ibhande elikhulu lomhlume emhlabeni wonke** - The first sentence directly states it is the largest mangrove forest in the world.
*   **D: Ikhaya lezinyamazane ezinamabala kunezingwe eziseBengal** - The passage states there are approximately 30,000 spotted deer and Bengal tigers."
Iyiphi ingxenye yehlathi ephakathi nendawo yaseNdiya?,"The correct answer is **A: ISundarbans National Park**.

The text states: ""Ingxenye yehlathi elisensimini yabaseNdiya libizwa ngokuthi i-Ipaki Lesizwe i-Sundarbans"" which translates to ""The portion of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.""



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase abe nokuqonda okulinganiselwe kolimi lwesiNgisi?","The correct answer is **B: Abantu abasebasha ngokweminyaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nakwezinye ezengeziwe ungalindela ulwazi olulinganiselwe - ikakhulukazi phakathi kwabantu abasha."" This directly translates to ""...in others you can expect limited knowledge - especially among young people."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umuntu okhuluma okungenani ezinye izilimi ezimbili (Someone who speaks at least two languages):** The passage doesn't suggest that multilingualism leads to limited English knowledge.
*   **C: Abantu abavakashela iToronto (People visiting Toronto):** While visitors might not be fluent, the passage doesn't focus on them specifically.
*   **D: Abantu asebekhulile ngokweminyaka (Older people):** The text points to younger people having limited English knowledge, not older people.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ibe nzima ukuyiphimisela?","The correct answer is **B: Amakheli**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kaningi kulula ukuqonda amazwi abhaliwe kunakhulunywayo, futhi. Lokhu kuyiqiniso ngokukhethekile ngamakheli, lawo kaningi okunzima ukuwaphimisela kahle."" (It's often easier to understand written words than spoken ones, and this is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce correctly.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amagama avela endleleni ehlukile yokukhuluma:** While the passage mentions different accents, it doesn't specifically say these are difficult to *pronounce*, only that they are part of local speech.
*   **C: Amagama abhaliwe:** The passage states written words are *easier* to understand than spoken words.
*   **D: Ulimi lwasemgwaqweni lwendawo:** This is related to the accents mentioned, but the passage points to the difficulty of pronunciation specifically with *addresses*.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isibonelo esingasiza umuntu ovakashayo ohlele ukuthatha ibhasi esuka esiteshini sesigodi se-inter?","The correct answer is **A: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke eJakar futhi uselithengile kusengaphambili ithikithi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""amaningi, ikakhulukazi lawo aya ngasempumalanga naseJakar/Bumthang asuka phakathi kuka-06:30 no-07:30.""  This means buses to Jakar are frequent during that time.
* **The passage also says:** ""...kuyatuseka ukuthi uthenge ithikithi ezinsukwini ezimbalwa ngaphambili."" (It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.)

Therefore, a traveler going to Jakar *and* having pre-booked their ticket is a direct application of the information provided in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke eBumthang futhi udinga ukuhamba ngo-7:** While buses *to* Jakar/Bumthang leave around 7:00, the passage doesn't provide a reason this is particularly helpful advice.
* **C: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke eParo futhi udinga ukuhamba ngemva kuka-11:** The passage mentions shared taxis are good for Paro, not buses, and doesn’t mention times.
* **D: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke empumalanga futhi ufika esiteshini ngaphambi kuka-6:20:** While buses to the East leave between 6:30 and 7:30, simply arriving before 6:20 doesn’t highlight a key takeaway from the passage (like pre-booking due to crowding).



"
Yikuphi okungaba icebiso elihle ngomuntu ovakashile ofuna ukuhamba aye empumalanga esuka ngebhasi esigodini sase-inter?,"The correct answer is **B: Thenga ithikithi kusengaphambili**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Njengoba amabhasi esifunda ngokuvamile egcwala, kuyatuseka ukuthi uthenge ithikithi ezinsukwini ezimbalwa ngaphambili."" (As district buses often get full, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amabhasi ahamba kuphela ngemva kuka-8:30** - This is incorrect. The text says most buses to the east and Jakar/Bumthang leave *between* 06:30 and 07:30.
*   **C: Amabhasi amaningi ahamba phakathi nosuku** - While buses run all day, the text highlights that the *main* departures to the east are early morning.
*   **D: Utekisi elihlanganyelwano lingaba indlela enhle yokuhamba** - This is true for *nearby* locations like Paro and Punakha, but the question specifically asks about traveling *east*.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi kahle iTimbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Akufikeki khona ngebhanoyi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Timbuktu *does* have an airport (""linesikhumulo sezindiza""). This directly contradicts the idea that it is inaccessible by vehicle (like a plane).

Let's look at why the other options *are* good descriptions based on the text:

*   **A: Inomthelela omningi wase-Arabh kunezwe lonke** - The text explicitly says it has ""a more Arabic feel than African.""
*   **B: Ukukhahlamezwa inhlupheko** - The passage mentions it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger due to desert encroachment.
*   **D: Isalokhu iyindawo ekhangayo kubantu abanelukuluku** -  The passage states it is ""a city loved by tourists.""



"
Yiliphi iqiniso elilandelayo elimayelana neTimbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ibhanoyi liyakwazi ukufika kule ndawo** (A plane can reach this location).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...futhi linesikhumulo sezindiza"" (and it has an airport). This means planes can access Timbuktu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Indawo ecebile kunokuba mpofu** (A wealthy place rather than a poor one): The text doesn't mention wealth or poverty. It does mention being on a list of world heritage sites *in danger*, which suggests vulnerability, not wealth.
* **C: Inezinto ezimbalwa zase-Afrika kunamadolobha azungezile** (It has fewer African things than surrounding cities): The text specifically says Timbuktu is *different* from other cities in the country because it has a more Arabic influence than African. This supports the idea of *less* African influence, but the phrasing in this option is awkward.
* **D: Idolobha elingasazikhangi izivakashi** (A city that doesn't attract tourists): The text says ""...nakuba idumela lalo lilenza lithandwe izivakashi"" (although its reputation makes it loved by tourists). This directly contradicts the statement.



"
Ahlelwa nini Olympic asehlobo kwasekuqalenni? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ngo-Agasti 2021**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ama-Paralympic azokwenzeka kusukela ngomhla ka-24 Agasti kuya ku-5 Septemba 2021"" (The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021).  While the question asks about the Olympics (not Paralympics), the text connects the two events and implies the Olympics happened *before* August 2021.  The text also mentions the Olympics were originally scheduled for July 2020 but were delayed.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kungasiphi isikhathi lapho umoya onjengefanela uba isivunguvungu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngemva kokuthinta umhlabathi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ziqala njengamafanela ayehlayo emafwini wesiphepho, bese ziba “izivunguvungu” **lapho zifika phansi**."" 

This directly translates to: ""They start as rotating fans in cloud formations, then become “tornadoes” **when they reach the ground**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lapho imimoya ifinyelela kumamayela angu-100 ngehora** - While high winds are *part* of a tornado, the text doesn't say that's *when* a fan becomes a tornado. It's a characteristic *of* a tornado.
* **B: Lapho ingxenye yomoya iqala ukuzungeza** -  The ""fan-like"" description already implies rotation. Rotation isn't what *makes* it a tornado.
* **C: Kuyilapho yehla efwini eliyisivunguvungu** - This is circular logic. It's already stated to be a tornado *when* it reaches the ground.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okuyisici esinembile mayelana nesivunguvungu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuhlale kwenza umoya oyisivinini esingamamayela nagu100 kuya ku-200 ngehora** (It always makes the wind at a speed of 100 to 200 miles per hour).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Zingenza imimoya ephakeme (ngokuvamile amamayeli angu-100-200/ihora)"" - meaning they *create* high winds, usually between 100-200 mph.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sivame ukuhamba nezinto ezisindayo** (They often travel with heavy objects) - While true, the passage says they *lift* and carry objects, but doesn't say they *travel* with them as a defining characteristic.
* **C: Ziba njengefanela lapho nje sithinta phansi** (They become like a funnel when they touch the ground) - The passage states they *start* as funnels, but they become ""tornadoes"" when they reach the ground, not stay as funnels.
* **D: Kuzungeza ingxenye leyo ephusha umoya phansi** (It revolves around the part that pushes the air down) - The passage doesn't describe the rotation around a specific part that pushes air down. It just explains how they pull air in.

"Ngokwale ndaba, umuntu ovakashayo kufanele alithole kuphi icebiso mayelana nesixazululo sezepolitiki edolobheni alivakashelayo?","The correct answer is **A: Kuhulumeni wezwe azobe elivakashele** (The government of the country they will be visiting).

Here's why:

The passage states that while your own government's advice is designed for *their* citizens, and may not reflect the nuances of your situation, the government of the country you're visiting will have advice tailored to the specific political situation *within* that country.  The passage suggests checking the host government's advice *in addition* to your own.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emibonweni ekhona endaweni yezivakashi yokuthola usizo** (Opinions available at the tourist information area for assistance) - The passage specifically describes these opinions as ""short summaries"" and ""superficial"" compared to more detailed information.
* **C: Ezakhamuzini zezwe umuntu azobe elivakashele** (Citizens of the country a person will be visiting) - While you could *ask* citizens, their views wouldn't be official advice.
* **D: Kuhulumeni wabo** (Their own government) - The passage states this advice is tailored to *their* citizens, not necessarily the visitor.



"
"Ezimweni zonikeza izivakashi usizo, yini umuntu wakwelinye izwe angase ayilindele?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukhanseleka komushwalense okuthintekile** (Affected travel insurance).

Here's why:

The passage states directly: ""Uma izwe ozolivakashela lithola izixwayiso zokuphepha ezingokomthetho, umshwalense wakho wohambo wempilo noma umshwalense wakho wokukhansela uhambo ungathinteka."" (If the country you are visiting receives official safety warnings, your health travel insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukubuyekezwa okwedlulele mayelana nezimo zepolitiki zezwe** (Excessive review of the country's political conditions): The passage says the advice is *brief* and *superficial*.
* **C: Umshwalense wempilo othintekile** (Affected health insurance): While health insurance *can* be affected, the passage mentions both health *and* cancellation insurance.
* **D: Imininingwane ecacile mayelana nesimo sezepolitiki sezwe** (Clear information about the country's political situation): The passage specifically says the advice is *not* detailed.

"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lohambo olungadinga ubhukhe ukuba uthole usizo kuyi-ejent yezokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **D: Uhambo lokuqala lwapheshela lomuntu ohambayo (A first-time traveler's trip)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are a good choice when someone lacks knowledge of ""destination, culture, language or countries that lead to lower costs."" A first-time traveler is *by definition* lacking that knowledge. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A:** If you've been to the city before, you likely already have some knowledge.
*   **B:**  Having a specific budget doesn't necessarily mean you *need* an agent, just that you're price-conscious.
*   **C:** While language barriers are mentioned as a reason to use an agent, the passage also says agents specialize – a language barrier trip could be handled by an agent *specializing* in that region/language, but doesn't automatically necessitate *any* agent.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isibonelo ovakashile angazuza kuzo ngokuphathelene nosizo lwe-ejenti yezokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho ovakashile enesithakazelo sokubhukha uhambo okokuqala ngqa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are a good choice for travelers who lack knowledge of destinations, culture, languages, or budget travel.  Someone booking their *first* trip is likely to lack this knowledge and therefore benefit most from an agent's expertise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Booking a round-trip ticket is a simple task that doesn't necessarily require an agent.
*   **C:** Knowing the local language makes an agent less essential.
*   **D:** While cultural differences are important, an agent isn't *specifically* needed just for a place with different customs – a traveler can research this themselves.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba elandelayo, yini engasiza ovakashile agweme ukuphoxeka kuyilapho evakashele indawo entsha?","The correct answer is **A: Ukulindela izindinganiso ezifanayo nezalapho asuka khona**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Uma uthatha uhambo, lindela izinto ukuba zingafani “nasekhaya”... Lokhu okuthile okumelwe uhlale ukukhumbula, ukugwema ukudumazeka...""  This means anticipating differences is key to *avoiding* disappointment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** Trying new foods is good, but doesn’t directly prevent disappointment from differences in culture.
*   **C:** Following the laws of the new place is important, but doesn't address the broader concept of expecting things to be different.
*   **D:** Searching for accommodation beforehand is a practical travel tip, but unrelated to avoiding cultural shock.



"
"Ngokusekelwe kulokhu kwaziswa okukule ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwabantu olungaphoxeka lapho luvakashele enye indawo?","The correct answer is **B: Umuntu ochumayo ngoshintsho** (A person who is inflexible with change).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that you should *expect* things to be different and *avoid being upset* by the local ways of doing things. This directly implies that people who struggle with change – those who prefer things to stay the same – are the ones most likely to be disappointed or disturbed when traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umuntu othanda ukudla okuphezulu** (A person who loves food): The text mentions food differences, but doesn't suggest a fondness for specific cuisine makes someone prone to being upset.
*   **C: Umuntu ongafuni ukucabanga kakhulu** (A person who doesn’t like to think much): The passage actually encourages *thinking* and preparation before a trip.
*   **D: Umuntu othanda ukufunda izinto** (A person who likes to learn things): A curious and open-minded person is *less* likely to be upset by differences – they would probably enjoy learning about new cultures!

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungakhutazwa kubantu abavakashela amazwe asathuthuka okokuqala?,"The correct answer is **A: Thola ulwazi ngezilwane zendawo ngaphambi kokuba ulale phansi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically warns against sleeping directly on the ground in unfamiliar areas due to local wildlife (""Ungalali kumatilasi noma endwangwini entofontofo phansi ezindaweni ongazi kuzo izilwane zendawo""). It then recommends using a camp cot or hammock for protection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage suggests *spending* more on Western comforts initially, not restricting food.
*   **C:** While the passage recommends a cot or hammock, it's to *avoid* sleeping directly on the ground, not to encourage it.
*   **D:** The passage *does* suggest spending more on higher-quality accommodations initially, but as a way to acclimate, not as a permanent solution.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabalwanga njengento ongachitha imali yakho eningi kukho lapho ujwayele amazwe asathuthuka?,"The correct answer is **C: Umatrasi noma into enjengesipontshi uma uzokhempa**.

The passage specifically advises *bringing* a camp cot or hammock for camping, to protect yourself. It doesn't suggest spending *money* on them to get adjusted.  The passage recommends spending money on Western-style food, high-end services, and upscale hotels *to* adjust."
"Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungaba kuhle kumuntu onenqubomgomo ofuna ikhophi yakhe naye ezobasemshinini wezobuchwepheshe, kodwa engenayo i-inthanethi?","The correct answer is **C: Ukugcina ikhophi igciniwe kuyilaptop yabo** (Keeping a copy saved on their laptop).

Here's why:

* **The prompt specifically states:** ""Uma usohambweni uhamba ne-laptop noma uthebhulethi, faka ikhophi yayo kuyo noma kuyidiski (iyatholakala ngisho noma ungenayo i-inthanethi)."" (If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, put a copy on it or on a disk (available even if you don’t have internet).)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nikeza lowo ahamba naye ikhophi** (Give a copy to the person they are travelling with) - While good advice from the original prompt, it doesn't address the *lack of internet* specifically.
* **B: Yithumele kuye nge-email** (Send it to them via email) - Requires internet access.
* **D: Ukugcina ikhophi “kuyi-cloud”** (Keeping a copy “in the cloud”) - Requires internet access.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungadingeki ukuba kuboniswe kuyinqubomgomo?","The correct answer is **D: Ikheli le-email lomnikazi wenqubomgomo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically requests the email address of the *insurance provider* (umuntu onikeza ngomshwalense), not the policyholder (umnikazi wenqubomgomo).  The other options (A, B, and C) are all explicitly mentioned as needing to be available on the policy copies.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are needed:

*   **A: Inombolo kazwelonke yokwenza izicelo:** The text asks for international phone numbers for filing claims.
*   **B: Ikheli le-email labezomshwalense:** The text *directly* asks for this.
*   **C: Inamba yocingo kazwelonke yokugunyaza:** The text asks for international phone numbers for authorization/approval and claims.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yimuphi usayizi ongemuhle oveza uhlelo lwefilimu oluvame ukusetshenziswa kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: U-36 X 24 mm kokungekuhle**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Evamile ifilimu ingu-35 mm (36 uphindaphiwe ka-24 mm) iwona abevamile."" This translates to ""Typically film is 35mm (36x24mm) which was the most common.""

While the text also mentions 6x6 and 56x56mm formats, it explicitly states that 36x24mm (within the 35mm format) was the *most common*. Therefore, it's the correct answer."
Ikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo mayelana nohlelo lwefilimu olunikeza ukubukeka kwesithombe esifanayo neDSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Ifilimu engu-35 mm**.

The text states: ""Evamile ifilimu ingu-35 mm (...) inikeza okubukeka okulinganiselwa kulokho okukhona kwe-DSLR."" This directly translates to ""Normally 35mm film (...) provides an appearance similar to that of a DSLR.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungaba isinyathelo sokugcina ekuqaliseni ibhizinisi lokubhala elikhuluma ngokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **C: Khanda eyakho iwebusayithi** (Launch your own website).

Here's why:

The passage states that *after* getting comfortable with contributing to an established travel blog and improving your skills, the next step is to create *your own* website.  This is the final step in the progression described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuzama ukwenza uhlelo lwewebusayithi** (Trying to create a website scheme) - This is too vague and happens *before* launching.
* **B: Ukubhala izihloko eziningana ze-blog enokwethenjelwa yezokuvakasha** (Writing several reputable travel blog articles) - This is the *first* step mentioned, not the last.
* **D: Cijisa amakhono akho okulungisa** (Refine your skills) - Skill refinement happens *throughout* the process, not as a final step.



"
"Lapho uqala ibhizinisi lokubhala ngohambo, yiliphi ikhono kulawa alandelayo okungase kudingeke uwacijise kuqala?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukwazi ukubhala i-blog (The ability to write a blog)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that the *easiest* way to start a travel writing business is by improving your skills on an *existing* travel website blog. This means the primary skill needed to begin is the ability to write blog posts. 

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: Ukulungisa iwebusayithi (Fixing a website)** - The passage suggests *using* an existing website, not fixing one.
* **C: Ukulungisa osekubhaliwe (Editing written material)** - Editing is important, but the first step is being able to *create* content.
* **D: Ukwakha iwebusayithi (Building a website)** - The passage says you can build your *own* website *later*, after getting comfortable with writing.



"
Izinkinga zamathumbu zivame ukutholakala ngaphansi kwaziphi izimo zezulu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezimweni zezulu ezishisayo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngakho izishayo zaseDelhi Belly, i-Pharaoh's Curse, iMontezuma's Revenge, kanye nabangane babo abaningi... izinkinga zesisu ezindaweni ezinesimo sezulu esishisayo zivamile..."" (So illnesses like Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge, and many of their friends... stomach problems in hot climates are common)."
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuchayeka njalo kungaholela ekuchayekeni kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Ezinkingeni zamathumbu** (To stomach problems).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly discusses how exposure to new germs in different climates can lead to stomach problems like ""Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge."" It directly links travel and exposure to different environments with digestive issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Emagciwaneni endawo** (To local germs) - While the passage mentions local germs, it focuses on the *problems* caused by *new* germs.
*   **C: Ezinkingeni zokuphefumula** (To breathing problems) - The passage mentions breathing problems as an example of climate-related issues in *cold* climates, not warm ones discussed in the main point.
*   **D: Isifo sohudo** (Skin disease) - The passage doesn't mention skin diseases at all.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo yinto enhle lapho uhamba phakathi nendawo yaseSchengen?,"The best answer is **A: Gwema ukufaka izicelo ezihlukahlukene zama-visa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ngokuba ne-visa ye-Schengen, awudingi ukubhalisela i-visa yezwe ngalinye ngokuhlukile kulawo angamalungu e-Shengen..."" This directly relates to avoiding multiple visa applications.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ukulondoloza imali:** While avoiding visas *can* save money, the passage states it saves time and *effort* specifically regarding the forms, not just money.
* **C: Gwema izindawo okuhlolwa kuzo amaphasiphothi:** The passage mentions less frequent passport checks, but the primary benefit isn't *avoiding* them entirely, but rather having easier border crossings.
* **D: Awekho amaphasiphothi adingekayo:** The passage states you often don't have your passport *checked* at borders, but doesn’t say you don't need to *have* one.



"
Yini engasatholakala ethuneni likaTutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikhanda lesidumbu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uma liqhathaniswa namanye amathuna wasebukhonsini, ithuna likaTutankhamun... cishe akubalulekanga ukulivakashela... njengoba kubonakala ikhanda namahlombe kuphela."" This directly indicates that the head and shoulders of the remains are still present in the tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imihlobiso ethile:** The passage states the tomb has *limited* decorations.
*   **C: Amahlombe esidumbu:** While the shoulders *are* mentioned alongside the head, it is not the sole thing remaining.
*   **D: Umcebo:** The passage explicitly says ""Ingcebo emangalisayo yethuna ayisekho kulo, kodwa iyiswe eMnyuziyamu yaseGibhithe e-Khayiro"" (The amazing treasure of the tomb is no longer in it, but has been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo)."
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo yaseVancouver engabakhanga kancane abantu abavakashile abakhathazeke kakhulu ngamanani? ","The correct answer is **D: IWhistler**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Whistler...iyabiza"" (Whistler is expensive). This directly implies that it's a less appealing option for visitors concerned about cost. The other options are presented as accessible and enjoyable without mention of high prices.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo ebonakala inganikeza izivakashi isikhathi esimnandi eVancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Isiqhingi sase-Bowen (Bowen Island)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is a ""popular day trip or weekend getaway"" offering various activities like boating, hiking, shops, and restaurants.  It's presented as a desirable location for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: IWhistler:** While mentioned, it's described as expensive and is further away (1.5 hour drive).
* **C: EDowntown Vancouver:** The passage mentions Granville Island *within* Vancouver, but doesn't position downtown Vancouver itself as a standout destination for fun.
* **D: Isiqhingi iGranville (Granville Island):** This is a departure point *to* Bowen Island, not a destination itself as described in the text.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kufanele abavakashi bayivakashele nini i-Fall uma befuna ukubuka ngaphandle kwezithiyo?","The correct answer is **D: Ngaphandle kwenkathi ezimvula**.

Here's why:

The text states that during the rainy season (November to March), the water levels are *so high* that it becomes difficult to *see* the Falls themselves - they are essentially obscured by water. Therefore, to see the Falls without obstruction, you would need to visit *outside* of the rainy season.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ejabulisayo ngokuvakashela iVictorial Falls phakathi noNovemba noMashi?","The correct answer is **C: Isimangaliso sokubuka lo mfula** (The wonder of seeing the waterfall).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that during the rainy season (November to March), the waterfalls are at their most powerful and spectacular: ""Ngesikhathi semvula (Novemba ukuya kuMashi), izinga lamanzi lizobaphezulu futhi iZimpophoma zizoba namandla kakhulu."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water level will be high and the Victoria Falls will be at their most powerful).  It emphasizes the dramatic effect of the water, even to the point where it might be hard to *see* the falls themselves due to the sheer volume of water. This points to a powerful and awe-inspiring experience, which aligns with ""isangaliso"" (wonder).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukwazi ukubuka umfula ngaphandle kwezithiyo** (Being able to see the waterfall without obstructions) - The passage suggests the opposite – it might be *harder* to see the falls because of the water.
*   **B: Kunezivakashi ezimbalwa** (There are few tourists) - The passage states it is a ""popular tourist destination"" and doesn't mention fewer visitors during this time.
*   **D: Gwema izinkathi zezimvula** (Avoid the rainy season) - The passage doesn't suggest avoiding the rainy season; it describes what it's *like* during the rainy season.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatuswa lapho usebenzisa i-drone ukushe wenze ifilimu?","The correct answer is **A: Ukubheka kusengaphambili ukuthi unayo yini imvume yokushutha** (Checking in advance if you have permission to film).

Here's why:

The passage *explicitly* states: ""If taking a photo of something is prohibited, you shouldn't even consider recording a video of it."" and ""check beforehand where you are permitted to film and what additional permits or licenses are required."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Thola amalayisense engeziwe** (Obtain additional licenses) - While this *might* be necessary, the passage stresses checking *first* if filming is allowed at all. Licenses come *after* confirming permission.
* **C: Izimvume zokucwaninga** (Research permissions) -  The passage doesn't mention research permissions.
* **D: Ukushutha ezindaweni ezinabantu abaningi lapho ama-drone engaqapheleki** (Filming in crowded areas where drones are unnoticed) - The passage explicitly warns *against* flying drones near airports or people, even if not specifically prohibited locally. This is a bad idea.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, zikuphi izindaba ezinhle kakhulu zokusebenzisa i-drone?","The correct answer is **D: Ezindaweni lapho uthole khona imvume kusengaphambili** (In places where you have obtained permission beforehand).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that if taking a photo is questionable, you shouldn't even consider recording video. It emphasizes checking permissions *before* recording audio or operating a drone. This directly points to the importance of getting permission in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage warns against being near crowds.
*   **B:** While avoiding places requiring permits is good, it doesn't represent the *best* practice – proactively getting permission is better.
*   **C:** The passage discourages operating drones in busy areas due to safety concerns.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nezimfuneko zokubhalisela ivisa esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Wonke amazwe adinga ukubhalisa kuyiziphathimandla zendawo.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that *some* countries require registration, not *all*. It also mentions hotels handling it in some places, so it's not universally done through local authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: Uma uhlala endaweni yezivakashi ungase ungadingi ukubhalisa** - The text says ""yilabo kuphela abahlala ngaphandle kwezindlu zezivakashi okudingeka ukuthi babhalise,"" implying you might not need to if you're in a guesthouse.
*   **C: Ukuvakashela ihhovisi labantu abayohlala kwamanye amazwe kungase kudingeke** - The text mentions the possibility of needing to visit an immigration office.
*   **D: Kwezinye izindawo, amahhotela endawo ayakusingatha ukubhalisa** - The text directly states that in many countries with such a law, local hotels will handle registration.



"
"Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo, okungeyona indawo labo abavakashile abangaya khona ukuze bayobhalisa?","The correct answer is **C: Ehhovisili leposi lendawo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions registering at:

*   **Esiteshini samaphoyisa endawo** (local police station)
*   **Ehhotela ohlala kulo** (the hotel you are staying in) - though hotels often do this for you.
*   **Ehhovisini labantu abayohlala kwamanye amazwe** (the immigration office)

It **does not** mention needing to register at a local post office. Therefore, the post office is the one that's not a place to register."
Yini engase ingabi inzuzo ekuvolontiyeni kuyilapho usohambeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Umuntu ongase abe nesifiso sendlu nendawo yokuhlala** (A person who might want privacy and accommodation).

Here's why:

The passage states that many volunteer positions *provide* accommodation and food.  This means someone who highly values their own space and independent living arrangements might find volunteering while traveling to be a drawback.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umuntu ozama ukwakha abangane abasha** (A person trying to make new friends) – The passage says volunteering is a good way to meet new people.
*   **B: Umuntu ozama ukuthola umholo omncane** (A person trying to get a small salary) – The passage notes that *some* volunteer work provides a stipend (small salary).
*   **C: Umuntu onethemba lokuthola ikhono elisha** (A person hoping to gain a new skill) – The passage explicitly states volunteering can help you learn new skills.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuvolontiya lapho uhambile kungamzuzisa kanjani umuntu ovakashile ngokwezimali?","The correct answer is **C: Indlu nendawo yokuhlala kuvame ukunikezwa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...imisebenzi eminingi yokuvolontiya ihlinzeka **indawo yokuhlala nokudla** futhi embalwa iholela iholo."" This directly addresses how volunteering while traveling can be financially beneficial – by covering the costs of accommodation and food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uzohlale enayo imali ayitholayo** - While some volunteer positions offer a stipend, the passage doesn't focus on income *from* volunteering.
*   **B: Lokho kuvame ukuholela emathubeni omsebenzi** - The passage doesn't mention job opportunities as a financial benefit.
*   **D: Kungakusiza ukwazi ukuba nombono omuhle** - This is a benefit of volunteering, but not a *financial* one.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ibhekwe njengohambo nje lokuya eWalt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuchitha isikhathi sonke uhlala endaweni yaseDisney**.

Here's why:

The passage states: *""Ukuvakasha “okuvamile” kuhlanganisa ukundiza uye eSikhumulweni seziNdiza seZizwe Zonke sase-Orlando, ukuthatha ibhasi eliya ehhotela elise-Disney, **ukuchitha isikhathi esingangesonto ngaphandle kokuphuma endaweni yase-Disney**, kanye nokubuyela ekhaya.""* 

This directly defines the ""typical"" Disney World trip as spending a week *within* the Disney area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuchitha isonto lonke ubuka amapaki** - While visiting the parks is part of the trip, the passage emphasizes *where* you spend your time, not just *what* you do.
*   **B: Ukuhlala ehhotela elingaphandle** - The passage specifically mentions staying at a *Disney* hotel as part of the typical trip.
*   **D: Ukuthatha ibhasi usuka esikhumulweni samabhanoyo uye ehhotela** - This is just one step *to get to* Disney World, not the trip itself.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende mayelana neWalt Disney World esingelona iqiniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Amathikithi ePark-hopper ayakwazi ukuthunyelwa nakwabanye abantu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Amathikithi awadluliselwa."" (Tickets are not transferable). This directly contradicts option A, which claims park-hopper tickets *can* be transferred.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the passage:

*   **B: Kunendawo yokuhlala ekhona ngaphakathi** - The passage mentions taking a bus ""to a Disney hotel,"" indicating lodging is available on site.
*   **C: Kunamabhasi akhona athutha izivakashi ezisusa esikhumulweni samabhanoyi ziye ezindaweni zokuhlala** - The passage says ""taking a bus from Orlando International Airport to a Disney hotel.""
*   **D: Amathikithi aphakathi nosuku engase atholakale kuyiwebusayithi yokudayisa** - The passage mentions tickets being sold online via sites like eBay and Craigslist.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iziphi izinkinga ezilandelayo engaze kungaxoxwa ngayo ekuqeqeshweni okusezingeni eliphezulu noma ezincwadini?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukwazi ukusinda endle**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Izincwadi nomagazini abakhuluma ngokuphila endle zivamile, kodwa izincwadi ezikhuluma ngezindawo zezimpi zimbalwa.""  This directly translates to: ""Books and magazines talking about survival in the wilderness are common, but books talking about war zones are few.""

This means survival in the wilderness is *already* covered in existing literature. The passage emphasizes the *lack* of resources for war zone survival, which is what the specialized training aims to address.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukulungela ukusebenzisa into yosizo lokuqala (Preparedness to use first aid):** The passage mentions ""insiza yezimo eziphuthumayo eningi"" (a lot of emergency resources), suggesting first aid is part of the training.
*   **C: Ukulungela izindawo ezinempi (Preparedness for war zones):** This is the *entire point* of the training described.
*   **D: Ukudlala izindima (Role-playing):** The passage specifically mentions ""imidlalo yokulingisa"" (role-playing games) as part of the training.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isifundo esilandelayo okungenzela kwaxoxwa ngayo ekuqeqeshweni okusezingeni eliphezulu?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo ezinezimpi** (War zones).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the training is for people visiting countries considered ""war zones"" and that the course will deeply cover all the topics discussed, including realistic scenarios. While first aid (A) and survival skills (C) might be *part* of the training, the overarching focus is preparing for the specific challenges of a war zone. Option D is too broad, and doesn't relate as directly to the context of travel to a dangerous region.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi ongakukhetha okungcono ekugwemeni ukugcola kwamanzi?","The correct answer is **B: Thenga amanzi asebhodleleni**.

Here's why:

The passage states that if you have concerns about water contamination, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company. This directly addresses the concern of avoiding contaminated water.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bilisa amanzi imizuzu embalwa:** While boiling can help, the passage notes the *time* needed varies (""some areas a minute is enough, others need several minutes""). It doesn't guarantee complete safety.
*   **C: Bilisa amanzi umzuzu owodwa:** The passage specifically states that one minute may *not* be sufficient in some areas.
*   **D: Hlola amanzi ukuze ubone ukuthi bukhona yini ubungozi:** The passage doesn't mention checking for hazards; it focuses on *preventing* contamination risk by sourcing water from a trusted supplier.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ingabi nakwenzeka ngisho nakubabhukudi abanekhono?","The correct answer is **C: Ukubhukuda uphambane namagagasi** (Swimming against the current).

Here's why:

The text states, ""Ukufa okuningi kwenzeka ngenxa yokukhathala kokuzama ukubhukuda uya emuva ngokuphambene nomsinga, okungaba yinto engenakwenzeka."" This directly translates to ""Many deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukubhukuda eduze kakhulu nesisekelo solwandle** (Swimming too close to the seabed) - The text doesn't mention this as being impossible.
*   **B: Ukubhukuda emanzini ajulile** (Swimming in deep water) - While dangerous, the text says a strong current *in* deep water can form, it doesn't say swimming in deep water is impossible.
*   **D: Ukubhukuda eduze kwamagagasi** (Swimming near waves) - The text discusses currents *caused by* waves, but doesn't say avoiding swimming near them is impossible.



"
Yini okufanele uyenze lapho ubanjwa amagagasi?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhukuda ubheke kolunye uhlangothi.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Zama ukuqonda lapho ungabambekile khona futhi noma, kuye ngamakhono akho nokuthi uphawuliwe yini, ungathanda ukulinda ukutakulwa."" This implies trying to swim *parallel* to the shore to get out of the rip current, not directly against it.  Swimming parallel allows you to escape the concentrated flow of the rip current.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zama ukuphuma kuwo ngokubheka kolunye uhlangothi, yibe usubhukuda uye ogwini** - This is partially correct (swimming parallel), but the text doesn't say to immediately swim *to* shore. Escaping the current is the first priority.
* **B: Bhukuda usheshe ngokumelene namagagasi** - The text explicitly says trying to swim directly against a rip current is often futile and leads to exhaustion and drowning.
* **D: Bhukuda ngaphansi** - This is not mentioned in the text and would likely be ineffective and dangerous.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi lapho ukungavakashela khona inqaba kungaba isikhathi esiyinqophamlando eholidini lakho?","The correct answer is **C: ERhine Valley**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions visiting **castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley**.  The other options mention rivers (Danube, Erie Canal) and general water features, but not castles. The Rhine Valley is the only place explicitly linked to castles in the provided text.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatuswa ngabesifazane abavakashele lezi zindawo?","The correct answer is **B: Kugade ukuthi ukungafani kwamasiko kungase kugqugquzele okunye ukuziphatha kubantu bendawo** (Be aware that cultural differences may lead to some behaviors from locals).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly warns women to be aware of cultural differences** and how these differences can lead to what they might perceive as harassment (following, grabbing, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kugweme ukukhuluma ngokuthi ushadile yini noma cha** (Avoid talking about whether you are married or not): While the text *suggests* not disclosing marital status, it's not the primary takeaway or warning. It states women should say they are married *regardless* of their actual status.
* **C: Gwema ukufaka ubucwebe obukhangayo** (Avoid wearing flashy jewelry): The text allows for jewelry but advises against expensive-looking items. It's not a strict avoidance.
* **D: Qina uma kunesidingo** (Be firm when necessary): This is good advice in general, and *mentioned* in the text, but it's a *response* to a potential problem stemming from cultural differences, not the primary piece of advice.  The key point is *being aware* of those differences in the first place.



"
"Ngokwalokho indawo echazwe ngayo endabeni, yikuphi okungasiza abesifazane abavakashile?","The correct answer is **D: Uma ungakuthandi lokho othile akwenzayo qina ngokweqaba ngokucacile**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Qina lapho wenqaba amadoda, futhi ungesabi ukuzimela (umehluko wamasiko noma cha, awenzi kube okulungile!)"". This directly translates to standing firm and clearly rejecting unwanted advances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bephawule ukuthi akujwayelekile ukuba balandelwe** - While the text mentions being followed is *not uncommon*, it advises being assertive, not just noting it happens.
*   **B: Ukugqoka indandatho enkulu ebonisa ukuthi ushadile yini noma cha** - The text suggests a ring *can* help, but specifically says ""not an expensive looking one.""
*   **C: Ukuqonda ukungefani kwamasiko kusho ukuthi gweme ukuqina** - This is the opposite of what the text says. The text says to be firm *despite* cultural differences.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isibonelo esingadinga umuntu oshutha izilwane angakusebenzisa ngezinto ze-lens?","The correct answer is **B: Uma izithombe zizosetshenziselwa izinjongo zokudayisa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""amapaki ngezinye izikhathi anemithetho emayelana nokuthatha izithombe ngenjongo yokuhweba ngazo."" This directly relates to needing to be aware of regulations when photographing wildlife, particularly if you plan to sell the images.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikakhulu uma beshutha isilwane esincane** - While the text mentions small creatures needing different lenses, it doesn’t suggest this is *specifically* an example of when a photographer would need to be aware of something.
*   **C: Uma isilwane esishuthwayo sinamahloni** - The text mentions animals can be shy or angry, but this isn't something requiring a specific lens consideration.
*   **D: Uma ipaki linemithetho ekhethekile mayelana nokushutha izilwane** - The text mentions the rules, but the question asked for an example of what a wildlife photographer would need to consider related to *lenses*."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubalwe endabeni engase ibe inkinga kulabo abashutha izilwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuthola uhlobo kwe-lens edingekayo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* mention needing different lenses for different subjects:** ""Ukuthatha amafotho wasendle ngokuvamile kudinga ilensi yamafotho ende, nakuba izinto ezinjengomhlambi wezinyoni noma izidalwa ezincane zidinga amanye amalensi.""  This means the passage *addresses* finding the right lens.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as potential problems:

* **A: Ukuthola izilwane ezithile:** The passage states, ""Izilwane eziningi ezingavamile kunzima ukuzithola...""
* **B: Ukusebenza nezilwane ezinolaka:** The passage specifically says, ""Izilwane zasendle zingaba namahloni noma zibe nolaka.""
* **D: Ukusebenza ezimweni ezingezinhle kakhulu:** The passage mentions, ""Indawo ingabanda, ishise, noma ibe yimbi ngenye indlela.""



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kubangele izinkinga ngomshayeli odlula izintaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Kungabonakali kahle phambili**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukubonakala kungavinjelwa ukuwa noma ukufuthwa kweqhwa noma noma ngomswakama noma iqhwa efasiteleni lemoto."" This directly translates to visibility being obstructed by snow, ice, or moisture on the windshield.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lapho kunesiminyaminya esinamandla** - While strong winds can be dangerous, the passage specifically mentions wind *causing ice to fall* (which obstructs vision), not the wind itself as the primary problem.
*   **B: Kungase kube nokungqubuzana** - The passage doesn’t mention any disturbances like congestion.
*   **C: Kunomjuluko ohlezi emawindini** - The passage mentions ice forming on windows, not general dew.



"
Yini engase iqhubeke ikhona mayelana nentela emazweni amaningi?,"The correct answer is **A: Amanani** (Rates).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...intela yomholo ihlelwe ngendlela ehlukile emazweni ahlukene, futhi **amanani** nezingxenye ezehlukile zentela ziyahluka kusuka kwelinye izwe kuya kwelinye."" ( ""...income tax is structured differently in different countries, and different **rates** and tax brackets vary from country to country.""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izakhiwo** (Structures) - While the *structure* of tax systems varies, the passage focuses on the differences in *rates*.
* **C: Lapho ogcina khona izinto** (Where you keep your things) - This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **D: Ezinye izinhlobo zentela** (Other types of taxes) - The passage is specifically talking about *income* tax.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uma usebenza phesheya kodwa ukwenye indawo ikuphi lapho kubonakala sengathi ungathumela khona izinto zakho zentela?","The correct answer is **C: Ezweni osebenza kulo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ukusebenza phesheya ngokuvamile kusho ukuthi kuzodingeka ukhokhe intela **ezweni okulona**."" (working abroad usually means you will need to pay taxes in **the country you are in**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Noma kuphi lapho wena ukhona** (Anywhere you are) - While residency can sometimes play a role, the passage focuses on the country of *work*.
*   **B: E-United States** (In the United States) - This is too specific; the passage talks about international work in general.
*   **D: Noma kuphi lapho amanani aphansi** (Anywhere the rates are lower) -  While people *seek* lower tax rates, the passage doesn't state this is where taxes *must* be paid.  Tax evasion is illegal.



"
Yiziphi izitatimende kwezilandelayo esingayichazi kahle Imibukiso Yomhlaba?,"The correct answer is **C: Le micimbi ingathaha izinyanga eziyisithupha** (These events can last up to six months).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lezi zenzakalo ngokuvamile zithatha esikhathi esiphakathi kwezinyanga ezintathu kanye neziyisithupha"" (These events usually take between three and six months).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imibukiso yalokho amazwe anakho ezintweni zamagugu noma amasiko** (Exhibitions of what countries have in valuables or cultures) – While the passage mentions culture and history are *displayed*, it doesn't define the entire expo *as* an exhibition of valuables.
* **B: Ukubonisa isayensi yezitshalo eduzane nezobuciko nezemfundo** (Showing plant science alongside art and education) – This describes *International Horticultural Expositions*, which are distinct from World's Fairs (though related). World's Fairs cover a broader range of topics.
* **D: Amazwe awaphoqelekile ukuba abambe iqhaza** (Countries are not forced to participate) - The text does not make mention of whether countries are forced to participate or not.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwuthetho weWorld Fair noma i-International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **A: Imibukiso kufanele ibonise kokubili umlando wezwe nezinkinga zomhlaba**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Amazwe athathe ingxenye abemele amaciko kanye nemfundo ebonakaliswa ezindaweni zikazwelonke ukubonisa **izinkinga zomhlaba wonke noma isiko lezwe labo kanye nomlando**."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Izwe elifanayo alikwazi ukubamba le mibukiso minyaka yonke** - The text says they *could* happen annually if in different countries, meaning the same country can't host every year, but it doesn't state it's a rule.
*   **C: Imibukiso kufanele ithathe izinyanga eziyisithupha** - The passage says they take between 3-6 months, not specifically 6.
*   **D: Ukuze lo mbukiso ube khona wonke amazwe kufanele abambe iqhaza** - The text mentions countries *participating*, not that *all* countries are required to."
Ukwenza kuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okunganciphisa ukuhlasela kwezilwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukugcina ibanga elingamayadi angu-25 nezimpisi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""hlala okungenani amayadi/amamitha angu-100 kude namabhere kanye nezimpisi ezifana namanketshane futhi amayadi/amamitha angu-25 kude nezinye izilwane zasendle!""  This directly links maintaining distance to reducing the risk of attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuphatha amakhambi anephunga elimnandi:** The passage explicitly advises *against* handling or cooking fragrant foods because scents attract animals.
* **B: Ukususa udoti ezindaweni olahlwa kuzo:** While keeping a clean campsite is recommended, it's framed as preventing attraction, not directly avoiding an attack.
* **D: Ukuvimba izilwane lapho zifuna ukudla okulahliwe:** This is not mentioned in the passage and is potentially dangerous advice.  You shouldn't try to block an animal seeking food.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungashiwongo kule ndaba njengento eyimbangela yokuhlasela kwezilwane zasendle?,"The correct answer is **D: Izilwane ezingabajwayele abantu**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that many animals in the park *are* used to seeing people. It emphasizes that even *habituated* wildlife can be dangerous if approached too closely. The passage doesn't suggest that unfamiliarity with humans is a cause of attacks.
*   **A: Iphunga elinamandla** is directly mentioned as attracting bears and other wildlife.
*   **B: Ukwehluleka ukugcina ibanga** is explicitly stated as a major reason people are injured by wildlife.
*   **C: Ukondla izilwane zasendle** is warned against, and the passage implies that interfering with wildlife can lead to dangerous situations.

Therefore, the only option *not* identified as a cause of attacks in the passage is that the animals are not used to people."
