"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu mënuta jàppe ni ap tektal bu leer ngir mëna joolil bu baax akorjon bi?","The correct answer is **D: Yokkal gaawaay bi ngay jëfandikoo ngir ëfukaay yi ngir amaat yokkinu baat**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** discusses using the accordion (akordewon bi) to achieve a good sound (""bu baax"") and specifically mentions choosing between a good *bellows* (jëfandikoo mbiip bi) or a good *reeds* (gaawaay bi). The passage states that choosing the right reeds is important for a good sound.
* **The Question (Q)** asks about what contributes to good musical quality.
* **Option D** directly addresses the importance of the reeds (""gaawaay bi"") and their impact on sound quality (""ëfukaay yi ngir amaat yokkinu baat"" - sounds for achieving a good sound).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Mentions ""door poñ yi"" (doors/thresholds) which isn't related to the passage's discussion of musical instruments.
* **B:** Talks about ""solo"" music and ""dooleb muñ"" which aren't mentioned in the passage.
* **C:** Mentions ""loxo bu woyof"" (special bellows) and relates it to going far – a metaphorical statement not directly linked to the passage's core message.



Therefore, **D** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the information presented in the passage."
"Boy suwé okarjon bi, yan ci yii toop ñooy lay dimbali ngir nga yokk baat bi?","The passage (P) discusses the importance of education and learning, particularly music (piano and accordion). It emphasizes that knowledge is valuable and helps overcome challenges (""ngir mu gëna foor""). The question (Q) asks what helps someone achieve their goal.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Wites bu gëna bare:** ""Knowledge is valuable"" - This aligns perfectly with the passage's core message.
* **B: Doole bu gëna bare:** ""Work is valuable"" - While work is important, the passage *specifically* focuses on the power of *knowing* things (knowledge/education).
* **C: Wàññi yen li:** ""There is nothing there"" - This is the opposite of the passage's meaning.
* **D: Yëngëtu baaraam yu neew:** ""New valuable things"" - This is too vague and doesn’t directly connect to the central idea of the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Wites bu gëna bare** because the passage repeatedly highlights how knowledge and learning are crucial for success.

Lu tax nataal yi ci tele bi am seeniy cat yu ñu dagg?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngir ñu mëna def ay mbind yu ndaw ci suuf**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lii def nanu ko ngir wóoral ne nataal bi dafa muur ekarang bi yepp. Lii lanuy woowee overscan. Ci lu neexul ci xol, sooy def benn DVD, booram yi dinanu leen dàggtamit, te su widewo bi amee ay bind firi tamitjóge ci suuf, duñuleeen wone.""  This translates to: ""It is used to show the picture that is currently being shown. It often has overscan. When looking at the edge, sometimes a DVD is cut, the images are often cut off, and the video shows parts missing on the sides, making it difficult.""

* **This clearly indicates the issue is parts of the picture being cut off on the sides (ay mbind yu ndaw ci suuf).**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngir nataal bi fees xoolukaay bi yëpp** - This talks about the image being too bright, which isn't the problem described.
* **C: Ngir maye ay waxtaan yu yomb ci yeneeni melokaan** - This is about color issues, not missing parts of the image.
* **D: Ngir dagg ay mbind yu ndaw yu jege lool cat wi ci suuf** - While it mentions sides, it also mentions ""jege lool cat wi"" (very far sides), which isn't the core issue. The passage describes parts of the *normal* image being cut off.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci jafe jafe yii la kenn mëna jankonteel buy wëlbëti ap film ci melokaanu DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Ap nataal bu dul fees xoolukaay bi yëpp** (Problems with the quality of images appearing on DVDs).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses issues with DVD picture quality:** It mentions ""overscan,"" blurry images, and problems with how the image fits on the TV screen (""ci suuf, duñuleeen wone"").  The core problem is the *visual quality* of the DVD playback.
* **Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ay mbind yu ndaw yu ñu dagg tuuti (Short lengths of film they cut):** The passage doesn't mention anything about film being cut or edited.
    * **C: Ap nataal buy fees xoolukaay bi yëpp (Problems with the quality of images they appear):** This is very similar to A, but less precise. A focuses on the *source* of the quality issue - the DVDs themselves.
    * **D: Ay boor yu ñu dagg (The colors they cut):** While colors *could* be affected by quality issues, the passage doesn't specifically focus on color problems.  It's a broader issue of overall image clarity.



Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the central concern of the passage."
Fan la xarekat angalé yi nekkoon?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Seneraal John Cadwalder dina tambali ab congu tooñ ci garnison bu Angalteer ca **Bordentown**, ngir boloké bépp renfoor.""  This directly says the British garrison was at Bordentown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Assunpink Creek:** This is a location where the American soldiers camped, not a British base.
*   **B: Trenton:** This is where the battle took place, not where the British garrison was located.
*   **D: Princeton:** This location isn't mentioned in the passage in relation to the British.



"
Kan la màndargaam feeñ ci kayit bu ñu bind?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jang bi njëkk ci wayndaare bi John Nixon moko déf ci ëtug Independence Hall bi ci wéru Sulét juróom ñetti fan. Benn lañu yónnee woon George Washington 6 ci Sulet, jangalnako soldaram yi bisu 9 Sulet. Ben sotti demna London weeru Ut 10. **25 weti Dunlap ñu xamee ko itam ci sotti yu gëna yagg.** Sotti bu njëkk bi dundul lu yagg.""

This directly says that Dunlap printed the first copies of the Declaration of Independence and sent them out. The question asks who was responsible for the printing, and the text points to John Dunlap.



"
"Ban ci barab ñuy lim, ban la ici Dunlap broadside yi mujjee yegg?","The correct answer is **B: Butiku impriméwukaay bu Dunlap**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ci biir guddi gi digante 150 jàpp 200 sotti lañu defar, ñu xamee ko léegi ci “Dunlap broadsides”."" This directly translates to ""Of the copies printed, between 150 and 200 were printed, and they were mainly distributed as “Dunlap broadsides”.""  Therefore, the broadsides originated from Dunlap's printing shop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New York** - The passage doesn't mention New York as the place of origin for the broadsides.
*   **C: Londre (London)** - The passage states the copies were *sent* to London, not *from* London.
*   **D: Independence Hall** - Independence Hall is where the first public reading occurred, but not where the broadsides were printed.



"
Fan la xarekatu Kolonel Stark yi nekkoon?,"The correct answer is **D: Ci kanamu miir bi** (On the edge of the forest).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gridley wala Stark tekna benn pike bu wara tollu ci 100 pied (30 m) ci kawewaay ci **kanamu miir bi**..."" which translates to ""Gridley or Stark built a tall pike of around 100 feet (30 m) on the **edge of the forest**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ci njeexteel bët gànnaar, ci guddaayu miir bi** (In the heart of the battle, in the middle of the forest) - While the battle was nearby, the pike was specifically *on the edge* of the forest, not the middle.
*   **B: Ci ap tefes ci booru ndox mi** (On a hill overlooking the river) - The text doesn't mention a hill.
*   **C: Ci guddaayu bët gànnaaru peninsula bi** (In the middle of the battle on the peninsula) -  The peninsula is mentioned, but the location is specifically the forest edge.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ la gooru Stark yi yaatal seen miir?","The correct answer is **C: Ci waxtu bu géej gi waccee** (During the time the battle progressed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Niti Stark yi ñu ngi taxaw ci wetu ñagg bi féete bëj gànnaaru Colon bi."" which translates to ""And Stark and his men fought fiercely to defend the Colony."" This directly indicates Stark was actively fighting *during* the battle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ba Kolonist yi wootee ngir ñu gën leen a dooleel** (When the Colonists prepared to defend themselves) - This refers to the initial preparation, not *when* Stark was actively fighting.
*   **B: Ba ñu ko tàmm jaalee bërëpu xare bi** (When they began to move the army) - This is about movement, not Stark's fighting.
*   **D: Fekk xarekat yi wéy di dem ca kanam** (They built fortifications to defend the land) - This is about building defenses, not Stark's fighting.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo doon benn ci jàmono yu gëna meti yu Chine?","The correct answer is **C: Han Dynasty bi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...nekkoon ci diggante Han yi ak dynastie Jin yi."" This translates to ""...was during the Han and Jin dynasties.""  It specifically mentions the Han Dynasty as a significant period preceding the Three Kingdoms period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jin Dynasty bi:** While mentioned, the text places the Han Dynasty *before* the Jin Dynasty.
*   **B: Jàmono Xi’an bi:** Xi’an is a city, not a dynasty or period. The text mentions it as a location where many people died during the chaos.
*   **D: Jàmono Ñeeti Nguur ya:** This option doesn't appear in the text and isn't relevant to the dynasties discussed.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo dëggu ci mbooloop xarekat mel ni melentaan di dugg ci ap waxtu fu ñu amulee dëkkuwaay?","The correct answer is **A: Dañuy nekk ci taag bu waxtu guddi jote**.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a situation of looting and destruction (""saccage"").** It mentions people taking things (""larme bëgg suukar dafay dox guddi"") and damage being done (""mboolo bi tàmbalina tukki bi lékk gi tambalé wañéeku"").
* **Q asks about the *reason* for people gathering.** It asks what motivates them to come together.
* **Option A (""Dañuy nekk ci taag bu waxtu guddi jote"" - ""The damage is in a good place/time for looting"")** directly links to the context of looting described in P. It explains why people would gather - to take advantage of the destruction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amu ñu lekk bu doy (""They are looking for peace"")** - This contradicts the violent and destructive nature of text P.
* **C: Dañuy defar ay taag yu ñuy soopi bu 17 bës rombee (""The damage has created 17 support groups"")** - This is unrelated to the text and introduces a concept not mentioned.
* **D: Dañuy dox waxtu bëcëk (""The damage happened a short time ago"")** - While possible, it doesn't explain *why* people are gathering; it just states *when* the damage occurred.  The question asks for a *reason* for the gathering.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban kàddu mooy wone bu baax nu xarekat yi mel ni ay melentaan tàmmee taag yi ci waxtu bu ñu amulee dëkkuwaay?","The correct answer is **A: Dañuy defar ay taag waxtu guddi gi**.

Here's why:

* **P's text states:** ""Ci tukki gi, dañuy def ay tagguk ndegeeniku yuy soppéeku bés bu né."" This translates to ""In that time, the damage caused many wounds, very deep ones.""  This directly refers to causing ""taag"" (wounds/damage) during a specific time (""waxtu guddi gi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dañuy dox 17 fan te du ñu defar taag:** The text doesn't mention a specific number like 17.
* **C: Dañuy soopi taag yi bës bu nekk:** The text doesn't say the damage *healed* wounds, it *caused* them.
* **D: Dañuy wéy di jëfëndikoo taag yu ñu am ngir diirub xare gi:** This refers to protecting wounds for resolving a conflict - not what the text describes.

**Q's question** asks about what the damage caused.  Option A is the only one that accurately reflects the information provided in the text P.



"
Ban ci yii toop ñooy wéyi moone téewaayu nataal yi ci biti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay siikal endogene** (Endogenous cycles).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lii di rythme periodik yi, yi nga xamni nekku ñu ay tontu rek ci siñoo periodik yiy feeñ, amna ñu ci ay leeral yu bari yu jëm ci lu am bakkan..."".  This translates to ""These are periodic rhythms, which are known to have a certain periodicity, and are found in many biological processes..."".  The passage is describing internal, naturally occurring rhythms.

* **""Siikal endogene""** directly refers to internal, self-generated cycles.  *Endo-* means ""within"" and *gene* refers to origin/creation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay yëngëtu yeenisaay (Environmental influences):** While the environment *can* influence rhythms, the passage focuses on the *origin* of the rhythms themselves, not external factors.
* **C: Montaru yaram gi (Useful biology):** This is too broad and doesn't specifically relate to the core concept of periodic rhythms.
* **D: Yëngëtu yu ñu seetlu (Observed influences):**  Similar to B, this talks about things we *see* impacting rhythms, not the fundamental, internal driver.



"
Ban baat mooy wone ay nit yuy wone ay nataalu copite ci seen yaram?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) defines polymorphism:** It states ""Polymorphe mooy ñi nga xamni dañu bari lool mbir yu ñu bokk nuróo"" which translates to ""Polymorphic are those that are known to have many different forms that exist.""  This directly relates to having different characteristics.
* **The question (Q) asks about individuals having different copies of genes:**  This is exactly what polymorphism implies – variation within a population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphe:**  The passage defines monomorphic as being *uniform* – the opposite of what the question is asking about.
* **B: Ay organism:** Too broad.  The question is specifically about variation *within* organisms, not organisms in general.
* **C: Ay xeet:** (Meaning ""things"" or ""objects"") This is too vague and doesn't relate to genetics or inheritance.



"
Ban ci yii toop mooy baat bu baax bi ngir organism mi toog ci ap bërëp mu wuute?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Polymorphe mooy ñi nga xamni dañu bari lool mbir yu ñu bokk nuróo.""  This translates to: ""Polymorphic are those that are easily distinguished by the many different forms they exhibit.""  This directly relates to having diverse characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphe:** The passage says monomorphic organisms are *easily identified* because they *lack* variation (""xam ci monomorfik""). This is the opposite of diversity.
* **B: Askan:** ""Askan"" is mentioned in the first sentence, describing a characteristic, but isn't a type of organism related to diversity.
* **C: Ay xeet:** This translates to ""those who eat"" and has no relation to the concept of polymorphism.

**Therefore, polymorphism (Polymorphe) is the term that best describes organisms with many different forms/characteristics, making it the best fit for the question about what is good for an organism to adapt to its environment.**"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul doon ap misaalu bërëpu gàncax bu ñuy jëfëndikoo ngir jëfi turism?,"The correct answer is **A: Dox dem ci ap tundu fu ndox di waccee** (To go and see places to learn and understand).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on ecotourism, which emphasizes learning about and appreciating nature.** It mentions activities like observing wildlife, taking photos, and visiting parks to understand the ecosystem.  The core idea is experiencing nature *to gain knowledge*.
* **Option A directly reflects this learning aspect.** ""Dox dem ci ap tundu fu ndox di waccee"" means ""To go to places to learn and understand,"" which aligns perfectly with the passage's description of ecotourism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jël ay foto toor toor àll (Taking lots of photos):** While taking photos is *an activity* within ecotourism, it's not the *purpose* of it. The passage implies photos are taken to *document* understanding, not as the end goal.
* **C: Dem seeti ap muséewu siens (Visiting a science museum):** This is about formal education, not experiencing nature directly.
* **D: Naap jën ak meep (Sleeping and eating):** These are basic necessities, not the reason for engaging in tourism, especially ecotourism.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy tërëlinu yoonu dem ak dikk bi?","The correct answer is **A: Jëmukaayu liggéey** (Global warming).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the negative impact of excessive carbon in the atmosphere, leading to climate change and potentially disastrous consequences for humanity.**  It highlights the risk of a future where life is difficult (""barab biñu jogé"").
* **The question (Q) asks about the core problem being discussed.**
* **Option A, ""Jëmukaayu liggéey"" (Global warming), directly addresses the issue of rising temperatures and climate change caused by carbon emissions, as described in the passage.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay woto jambuur (Forests)** - While forests are important for carbon absorption, they aren't the *problem* being discussed, but rather a potential solution.
* **C: Ap biosphere bu woor (A healthy biosphere)** - The passage describes a *threat* to the biosphere, not its health.
* **D: Nu nit di jëmee kanam (We humans are living)** - This is a general statement and doesn't address the specific problem outlined in the text.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided text."
Partikul yu xooxu orbit yan faanu sars la ñu am?,"The correct answer is **A: Sars bu baax**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Proton yi dañoo am sarsu kuraŋ te nëtron yi amu ñu sars. Elektron yi sars bu negatif la am."" This translates to: ""Protons have a positive charge and neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative charge.""

The question asks about the charge of the particles orbiting the nucleus.  Electrons are the particles orbiting the nucleus, and the text explicitly says they have a *negative* charge (""sars bu negatif"").  ""Sars bu baax"" means ""positive charge,"" which is the charge of protons, not electrons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amuñu benn sars** - Means ""have no charge,"" which describes neutrons, not orbiting particles.
*   **C: Sars yu baaxul** - Means ""negative charges,"" which is correct for electrons.
*   **D: Sars yu baax ak yu baaxul** - Means ""positive and negative charges,"" which isn't a single answer to the question.



"
Xoox bi yan partikul la am?,"The correct answer is **D: Ay feppsaal, ay feppmaandu, ak ay mbëjfepp**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Xoox bi ñaari partikil la boole – nëtron ak poroton."" (The atom contains three particles - neutrons and protons.)
* It also mentions electrons: ""Elektron yi sars bu negatif la am."" (Electrons have a negative charge.)

Therefore, the atom contains neutrons, protons, and electrons – three types of particles.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay feppsaal ak ay feppmaandu** -  Missing electrons.
* **B: Ay feppmaandu ak ay mbëjfepp** - Incorrect terminology; ""mbëjfepp"" isn't directly linked to a particle type in the context.
* **C: Ay mbëjfepp ak ay feppsaal** - Missing electrons.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy ap misaalu arafu seexal bu juroomi tomb?","The question asks for an example of a binary number. Binary numbers only contain the digits 0 and 1.

* **A: 1010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.  **This is a valid binary number.**
* **B: 12001** - Contains the digit 2, which is not allowed in binary.
* **C: 10010** - Contains only 0s and 1s. **This is a valid binary number.**
* **D: 110101** - Contains only 0s and 1s. **This is a valid binary number.**

The question doesn't ask for a *specific* binary number, just *an example* of one. Since all of A, C, and D are valid, the best answer depends on context that isn't provided. However, since A is the simplest and often used example, it's the most likely correct answer.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is **A: 1010**.
"
Lan ci mbir yii lañuy wooye chiffre binaire?,"The passage states: ""Li ñuy waawe nombre binaire mënul am ludul benn wala ñaari nimero, manaam 0 wala 1, te nombre yooyu lañuy woowe chiffre binaire - wala bit...""  This translates to: ""A binary number only has two digits, either 0 or 1, and each of these numbers is called a binary digit - or bit...""

Therefore, a binary digit can be either 0 or 1, meaning there are **two** possible digits.

The correct answer is **A: Ay tomb** (which means ""two"" in Wolof).



"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu limul ci lu ñu bind ni ap njariñ bu njëkk ngir ndongo yii di am bolog?,"The correct answer is **A: Ap yeeslu ci tëgg waxin ak ci mën mënu mbind.**

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The text states:** ""Ndongo yi yen say danuy door ak garameer ak mbindin bu jaxaso, teewaayu nit ñi dafay soppi loolu ci lu bare.""  This translates to ""People want to open up and share their thoughts and experiences, and many people find satisfaction in doing so."" This directly relates to *expressing themselves and sharing their minds*.
* **""Mën mënu mbind""** means ""sharing thoughts/minds.""
* **""Tëgg waxin""** refers to expressing oneself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nàttango yi wàññi ngaññ yi:** (Relationships and benefits) - The text doesn't focus on the *benefits* of blogging, but the *motivation* behind it.
* **C: Ap xel mu ubbeeku ci lu leen wër:** (Their intelligence in what they write) - While blogging *can* demonstrate intelligence, the text doesn't highlight this as the primary reason people blog.
* **D: Ap cofeel wu yokku ngir di wéy di jàng:** (A feeling of needing to grow and progress) - Growth and progress are potential *outcomes* of blogging, but not the initial driver according to the text.



Therefore, option A best encapsulates the core reason people start blogs as described in the passage: the desire to express themselves and share their thoughts."
Ban ci yii faanu bolog la ñu lim ni luy junj ndongo yi ñu yeesal seeniy mënin ci mbind?,"The correct answer is **A: Di tuntu saa su nekk ci jumtukaay yu nekk ci internet bi** (It is a tool that exists within the communicative practices of the internet).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Blogging ab jumtukaay la buy xalaatloo ab lëkkaloo..."" (Blogging is a tool for communication and connection...).  This aligns perfectly with option A.
* **The passage emphasizes how blogs allow individuals to share their thoughts and experiences online**, which is a core function of internet communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bëgg moytu ngaññ** (Talking a lot) - While blogs *can* involve a lot of talking, that's not its defining characteristic as described in the passage.
* **C: Teye interewu seeniy jotaay** (To protect their interests) - The passage doesn't focus on blogs as tools for self-preservation.
* **D: Soxla booloo liggéey ak ñeneen** (Helping to create relationships with others) -  While blogs *can* foster relationships, the passage primarily focuses on blogs as a means of expression and communication, not necessarily relationship building.

Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ap njariñu jookalante asynchrone ngir ndongo yi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Mëna jakaarloo ak jàngalekat yi waxtu bu mu mëna doon ci bës bi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ndongo daara yi itam mën nañu yónnee seeni laaj jàngalekat yi ci bis bi ndax ñu teel leen tontu, moo gën ñuy xaar ba meneen ndaje ma."" This translates to ""Later messages also allow them to develop their thought processes at their own pace, allowing them to respond more thoughtfully.""  This directly describes the benefit of asynchronous communication - taking time to formulate a response.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di jëfëndikoo internet ni ap jumtukaay:** (It is the development of the internet that enables jumping) - While the internet *facilitates* asynchronous communication, it's not the core *benefit* described in the passage.
* **C: Ay waxtu liggéey yu mëna wuute:** (Times that are easily wasted) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies. Asynchronous communication *saves* time by not requiring immediate responses.
* **D: Nekk njiit miy teete ñeneen ñi:** (It is a tool for quiet people) - While it might *help* quiet people, the passage doesn't focus on personality types, but on the *process* of thoughtful communication.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci faanu jokalante asynchrone yii toop moo jagul ak ndongo yi?","The correct answer is **D: Jëfëndikoo internet** (The development of the internet).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Jëfandikoo lënd gi ak World Wide Web may na ndongo yi ñu jot ci xibaar yi waxtu wu nekk."" This translates to ""The development of the land and the World Wide Web has allowed people to communicate in real-time.""  This directly links the development of the internet (World Wide Web) to asynchronous communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jàng di jiite (Loss of detail):**  While asynchronous communication *can* sometimes lead to misunderstandings, the passage doesn't focus on this as a defining characteristic.
* **B: Ay waxtu liggéey (Delayed time):** The passage *mentions* delays (""communication asynchrone dalay""), but it doesn't identify that as the *cause* or the main focus of the relationship.  It's a *result* of the communication type, not the reason for it.
* **C: Jumtukaay yuy jàngale (Easy information sharing):** While true, the passage isn't primarily about the *ease* of sharing information, but the *ability* to communicate despite time differences facilitated by the internet.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Lu ñu waxul ci baat bi ni lenn lu kenn mënuta boole ak këru buur ci jàmono xaaju àt ya?,"The correct answer is **C: Chevalerie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a world of knights, feasts, and adventures, very much in the style of Arthurian legends.** It mentions tournaments, banquets, and chivalrous acts.  The question (Q) asks what this way of life is called – a life focused on honor, courage, and service, often associated with knights.
* **""Chevalerie""** is the French word for chivalry, the code of conduct and ideals associated with knights. It perfectly encapsulates the themes presented in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay paxu kaso (These old stories):** Too general. While the passage *is* a story, it's asking for the *name* of the lifestyle depicted.
* **B: Xeex di jëfëndikoo ay bant yu gudd (Things that defend good people):**  Describes an *aspect* of chivalry, but not the whole system.
* **D: Ay Chevalier (The knights):** Refers to the *people* within the system, not the system itself.



"
Ban ci yii toop moom la ñu waxul ci lu ñu bind ni ap xet walla baat bu ñu mënutawoona wax ci biir këru buur yii daanu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay xeex**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage Focuses on Stories & Legends:** The passage (P) discusses inspiring stories, feasts, and the adventures of Arthur – essentially, *folklore* and *tales*.
* **""Ay xeex"" means ""stories"" or ""tales"" in Wolof.**  This directly aligns with the subject matter of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ragal (Men):** While men are *in* stories, the passage isn't fundamentally *about* men.
* **C: Ay taabal yu fees ak lekk (Tables with food and drink):**  Feasts are *mentioned*, but they are a *part* of the stories, not the central theme.
* **D: Ay tanku mala (Bad tanks/containers):** This is completely unrelated to the content of the passage.

**The question (Q) asks what the passage is mostly about.**  Since the passage centers on narratives and inspiration derived from stories, ""ay xeex"" (stories) is the most accurate answer.

Ban ci yii toop mooy ap firndeel bu dëggu bu kërup Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay miiru këru buur dëggëroon nañu lool te Boroom Hastings moo leen santaane woon.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""CI jamono 1480, bi Lord Hasting don tambali tabaxam, dëkk bi dafa xawon am jàmm te dañoo soxlawon kaarànge ngir muccu si raykatu nit yi.""  This translates to ""In 1480, when Lord Hasting built a mansion, the work was done with much labor and skilled artisans were hired to build a secure place for people.""
* **This directly implies** the building (Kirby Muxloe) was a strong, fortified structure, and Lord Hastings commissioned it. Option A reflects this - ""It was a very strong and secure fortress and Lord Hastings had it built.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While there was labor involved, the passage doesn't specifically say laborers were *brought from another country* during the building.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the foundation being unusual or difficult.
* **D:** While it was meant to be secure, the primary purpose wasn’t simply to impress people but to provide a safe haven.



"
Ban ci faanu tëralin yii la ñu mëna jàppee ni yu dul tontu faan yu ñu tàmm yi ngir Kërup Kirby Muxloe ci waxtu bu ñu bind ci mbind mi?,"The correct answer is **C: Dëggërlukaay bu gëna néew yu yeen këru buur yi am.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...dëkk bi dafa xawon am jàmm te dañoo soxlawon kaarànge ngir muccu si raykatu nit yi."" This translates to ""...the shop that was used to sell wood and provide scaffolding for the construction of homes for people.""  This directly refers to building materials and construction related to the homes being built (and thus the *faanu* - houses) around Kirby Muxloe.
* **The question asks:** about what was being *built* (houses) and what was used to build them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay palanteer yu rëy:**  (Royal surveyors) - The passage doesn't mention surveyors.
* **B: Ap tabax bu ñu tabax ngir tëkku xeex yi:** (Taxes paid for valuable items) - The passage mentions Lord Hasting's payment *for* building, not taxes on valuables.
* **D: Ay miir yu sew:** (Dried fish) - This is completely irrelevant to the passage's context.



Therefore, **C** is the only answer that aligns with the information provided in the text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy doon biy gëna am njariñ ngir ap dawkat miy waajal waxtu mii di dikk si?","The correct answer is **A: Di boole ay dawkat ci réew yi ngir diiru nawet gi ngir ñu jongante.**

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a situation where people are leaving their homeland (xaaju-genwall) due to hardship (gaawaay bi amatul solo, yaggaay bi dafay mujj).** They are seeking a better life elsewhere (""ngir jongante daw ci at mi"").
* **Q asks about the *reason* people migrate.**
* **Option A (""Di boole ay dawkat ci réew yi ngir diiru nawet gi ngir ñu jongante"") directly answers this: people leave their countries to find better lives.** It aligns perfectly with the hardship described in P and the search for a better future.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di farlu ci di tàmm gaaw waxtu taagatu (To focus on completing tasks when facing difficulties):**  While resilience is implied in P, it doesn't address *why* people are leaving.
* **C: Di door ap diiru ñeeti simili (To constantly seek similar improvements):**  P suggests a desire for a fundamental change, not just incremental improvements.
* **D: Di jëfëndikoo bërëpu taagatu yaram gi ngir tabax jëm yaram bi feetee kaw (To defend the valuable things of the past in order to preserve the past's legacy):** This is the opposite of what's happening - people are *leaving* the past behind.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo am solo lool ngir ap dawkat buy daw xaaju kilomeetar te bokk ci ñu gën?","The correct answer is **D: Di jàng daw ju gaaw ci kaw enduraans** (It's about running fast on a long-distance track).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) describes a long-distance race.** It talks about runners tiring, needing solitude, and pushing through difficulty. The emphasis is on endurance and speed over a significant distance (""kilometres"" is mentioned in Q).
* **Q (the question) asks about a task involving running a long distance.**  It specifically mentions ""kilometres"" and pushing oneself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di tërël ay jongante ci diggënte réew yi ci wéeru seddaay bi** (It's about traveling between countries in a comfortable car) - This is completely unrelated to the passage.
* **B: Di jàng enduraans ci kaw dawin bu gaaw** (It's about endurance running on a fast track) - While it mentions endurance, it doesn't connect to the *long distance* aspect.
* **C: Kronomeetare ci lu néew ñaari simili** (A stopwatch to measure similar times) -  This is a tool used in racing, but doesn't describe the *activity* itself.



Therefore, **D** best captures the essence of both the passage (P) and the question (Q)."
"Ngir ap dawkat, ban ci yii toop la ñu mënuta antul ci ay taagatu lekk kesse?","The correct answer is **A: Yokk seen mënin**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses people who are often criticized (""tàggatu yu set"") but who are actually good people (""wanté mën na am njexitaal ci wergu yaram""). It emphasizes judging people fairly (""xàm lékk gu wuté gu baax"").
* **Q (the question)** asks what happens when people judge (""ap dawkat"").
* The passage states that often, people are wrongly judged (""maneef"") and unfairly criticized (""tàggatu yu set"").  ""Yokk seen mënin"" translates to ""They are wrongly judged"" or ""They are judged unfairly,"" which directly aligns with the passage's message.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yokk seen bànneex:**  This means ""They are respected,"" which isn't the point of the passage.
* **C: Mënin gu gën:** This means ""Good judgment,"" which is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **D: Wër ci jëm yaram ji yëpp:** This means ""Working with good people and their families,"" unrelated to the passage's focus on unfair judgment.



"
"Sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu tektalul ni ap yoon ngir dawkat yu ndaw yi gëna am bànneex ci seen taagatu?","The correct answer is **A: Di lekk lu war**.

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes someone who is constantly busy, running around, and taking care of many things (likely responsibilities and commitments). They're overwhelmed but also doing well and appreciated.  The phrase ""tággatu yu set ci wàllum lekk rekk mënul jur tóor-tóor"" directly translates to ""busy people who only know how to run around.""

* **Q's question** asks about the reason *why* people often rush and get stressed trying to meet deadlines.

* **""Di lekk lu war""** (It's just a habit) directly answers the question.  People rush because that's how they've always operated, it's a pattern of behavior.  This aligns with the description of the person in P's text – constantly on the go.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di taagatu bu baax ci faan bu gëna kawe** (It's good nature to want to help) - While helpfulness might *contribute* to busyness, it doesn't explain the core reason for the rushing and stress.
* **C: Di naan ndox nu mu waree** (It's not a fault if they worry) - Worry is a *result* of being busy, not the cause.
* **D: Teye ap kàttan gu wër te tooloo** (There's no small work to be lazy about) - This is a moral statement about work ethic and doesn't address the question of *why* people rush.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and direct answer to the question, based on the context of the initial passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu tax ap dawkatu diggënte bu gaat wara jënd ap piesu jumtukaay bu gëna seer?","The correct answer is **D: Am na ay xalaat yu dëgguwul jëm ci jumtukaay yu seerul lool yi.**

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses products (jumtukaay) that are widely available but often don't meet quality standards (seerul). It highlights the problem of fakes and inferior goods.  The passage essentially says many products *claim* to be good but aren't.
* **Q (the question)** asks what happens when a product is found to be bad/poor quality.
* **D** directly addresses this – ""There are flaws found within the most common/popular products."" This aligns perfectly with the problem described in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nekk na lu ñu bëggël seen bopp:**  (There are those who complain about their peers) -  This doesn't relate to the quality of products.
* **B: Wone na ap njariñ:** (There are those who make mistakes) - While true generally, it doesn't address the *result* of a bad product being discovered.
* **C: Dina sopi bu baax seen mënin:** (They are very satisfied with their purchases) - This is the opposite of what the passage is conveying.



Therefore, **D** is the most logical and relevant answer based on the context of the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la daw diggënte bu gaat di laaj?","The correct answer is **A: Jumtukaay yu bare**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...am ay njuumte ci wàllu xalaat yu bare jëmële ci tuuti jumtukaay yi mu laaj ngir bokk ci.""  This translates to ""...I found myself in the midst of various problems related to the *bare jumtukaay* which made me suffer a lot.""  This clearly identifies ""jumtukaay yu bare"" as the subject being discussed in relation to causing problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap njiitlaayu dawkat bu sampu:** This phrase doesn't appear in the passage and isn't related to the context.
* **C: Jumtukaay yu ndaw:** The passage specifically refers to ""jumtukaay yu *bare*,"" not ""jumtukaay yu ndaw.""
* **D: Xaalis bu bare:** While ""xaalis"" (expenses) could be a problem, the passage directly links the issues to the ""jumtukaay yu bare.""

**Therefore, the question ""What did they bind, that made it difficult to achieve?"" is answered by ""Jumtukaay yu bare"" as they are identified as the source of the problems.**



"
Kan moo gëstu ba gis riiru nukléer yuy xëccaate? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch ak Purcell**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ci atum 1930 te Felix Bloch (di liggéey ci Daara ju Standford) ak Edward Purcell (mu Daara ju kaw jooju di Harvad)."" which translates to ""...in the 1930s, Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University) discovered..."" This clearly indicates they were the first to discover the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which is the foundation of MRI.

While Damadian made significant contributions to *applying* NMR to medical imaging (specifically identifying cancer), he didn't discover the core principles themselves.



"
Ci ban àt lañu nanguwoon royukaay bu njëkk mi ngir riiru paj ak nataal? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The text states: ""Ci atum 1977, ci la Dr. Damadian àggali tabaxum eskaneeru “whole-body” MRI bu njëkk, bimu daan woowee ”Indomitable”."" which translates to ""In 1977, Dr. Damadian unveiled the first “whole-body” MRI scanner, aptly named ”Indomitable”."" This directly answers the question of when the first full-body MRI scanner was created.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la nit ñi wara am jëm ci am degg degg bu am doole ngir mëna firi jëfinu ñeneen ñi?","The correct answer is **C: Ngëm**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes people being deceived or tricked.** They are shown things that aren't real, illusions.
* **""Ngëm"" in Wolof means ""lie"" or ""falsehood.""** This directly relates to the deceit described in the passage.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Bëgg bëgg** - means ""very much"", doesn't fit the context.
    * **B: Jublukaay** - means ""Europeans"", irrelevant to the passage's theme.
    * **D: Gis gis** - means ""stories"", while stories *can* be lies, ""ngëm"" is the more direct and accurate answer given the passage's focus on deception.

**The question (Q) asks what the people are being subjected to – lies.** Therefore, ""Ngëm"" is the most fitting response.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, xam jublukaay dina dimbamli nit ñi ñu def lan?","The correct answer is **D: Jàng xalaatu ñeneen ñi**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) repeatedly emphasizes the speaker's frustration with people who are *jàng xalaatu ñeneen ñi* – those who are arrogant, boastful, and think they know everything. The whole passage is *about* dealing with these kinds of people and the speaker's annoyance with them.  The question (Q) asks what the problem is with the people being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Daggal ñàkk xam ci ganaaw ay jëfin** (A certain difficulty in understanding their language) - While communication *might* be a factor, it's not the core issue described.
*   **B: Wax bëgg bëgg yi balaa ñuy am** (They have a lot of possessions) - The passage doesn't mention material wealth as a problem.
*   **C: Xool ñéneen nit ñi te bañ leen a àtte** (They help people and want to teach them) - This is the opposite of the problem; the people are portrayed negatively.



Therefore, **D** directly addresses the central complaint of the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo di ap tënk bu woor bu jublukaayu AI?","The correct answer is **B: Luy xaamee baat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lu mel nonu dafa nekk léegi jàng yu wute buy wéeru ci indi saafara ci jafe jafe àdduna.""  This translates to: ""Many people are already working on very important projects to improve the world in all areas.""  This directly relates to applying AI for positive, beneficial changes - a ""xaamee baat"" (good thing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tërël palang** (Strange language) - The passage isn't about the language itself, but the applications of AI.
*   **C: Tërëlin** (Strange) - While AI might *seem* strange, the passage focuses on its real-world impact.
*   **D: Luy tambalil boppam liggéey** (Many problems are being solved) - While AI *can* solve problems, the passage doesn't specifically state that many are currently being solved, but rather that people are *working* on solutions.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy lu ñuy tàmm booleel ak AI?","The correct answer is **A: Liggéey buy topatoo kilyaan** (It's a lot of cheating/deception).

Here's why, based on the passage (P):

The passage discusses the dangers of AI, particularly its ability to deceive (""muy xalaate"") and adapt (""muy adapter""). It talks about AI being used for malicious purposes (""faj, tabax ak ci arme bi"") and potentially controlling people's lives (""bind ci loxo nangu"").  The passage specifically mentions the use of AI in deepfakes and manipulated videos (""aplikaasioŋ ak logiselu powum wideo yu bari"").  

Therefore, the central concern highlighted is the *deceptive* nature and potential for misuse of AI. ""Liggéey buy topatoo kilyaan"" captures this idea of being misled and deceived.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Palang ak tërëlin:** (Speaking and arguing) - While AI can *generate* speech, the core issue isn't just communication, but the *falsehood* of that communication.
* **C: Xët wu ñu sos:** (What they are seeking) - The passage isn't about what people *want* from AI, but the risks it presents.
* **D: Ràññee mbindu loxo:** (Stealing people's thoughts) - While control is mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on thought theft specifically, but broader manipulation and deception.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Li gëna am solo ci xeetu xalaat boobu mooy: mën nañu ci am tontu yu baax yu bari."" This translates to ""The main goal of these types of situations is: to achieve good and important objectives.""
* **Option A** directly reflects this idea - ""Di ràññee ay tontu yu bare yu nuroo jëm ci ap jafe jafe"" means ""It achieves good objectives in facing challenges.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jëfëndikoo ay jumtukaay yu bées jëmële ko ci ap jafe jafe:** This means ""Understanding important points to help face challenges"" - while understanding *helps*, it's not the *goal* itself.
* **C: Jël seen waxtu ngir saafara ay jafe jafe:** This means ""Spending time to overcome challenges"" - Time is a *resource used*, not the *goal*.
* **D: Di rënk ci bopp bi ay melokaan:** This means ""It relies on the help of others"" - The passage doesn't emphasize reliance on others as the primary point.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu jappeewul ap mbir mu ñuy fonk ci xalaat yu bokk mingoo?","The correct answer is **A: Xam ni benn tontu bu baax rek moo am** (Knowing only good things is enough).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of focusing on good things (""tontu yu baax"") and avoiding negativity.**  It states ""Li gëna am solo ci xeetu xalaat boobu mooy: mën nañu ci am tontu yu baax yu bari."" (The main lesson from these experiences is: focus on good and important things).  And later, ""Li ngeen di jàpp seen xel mooy ñaari tontu, bu baax bi wala bu bon bi."" (What should guide your thinking is discerning good from bad).
* The question asks what people *should* do to avoid being overwhelmed by experiences. Focusing *only* on good things aligns with the passage's message.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jël sa waxtu (Just spend time)** - While spending time is valuable, the passage doesn't suggest that's the *key* to navigating experiences.
* **C: Di ràññee ay dëgg (To learn lessons)** -  Learning lessons is a *result* of experiences, but the passage stresses *how* to approach those experiences (with a focus on the positive).
* **D: Di dajale ay xebaar (To spread ideas)** - The passage isn't about sharing ideas; it's about personal mental wellbeing and how to cope with life's challenges.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu dul jappee ni ap jëfinu xarkanam gu gàtt?","The correct answer is **B: Di toñox say xef**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses people struggling to understand what is said to them, especially in video or audio formats.** They have difficulty processing information despite having good hearing. This aligns with the idea of *not being able to hear clearly* - ""toñox say xef"" means ""to not hear well"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di xool fu sore te nekk di wax:** This translates to ""It is difficult and it talks,"" which doesn't relate to the core issue of comprehension.
* **C: Di xef a ka xipi bu gaaw:** This means ""It hears and doesn't understand,"" which is closer but doesn't fully capture the difficulty *receiving* the information described in the passage.  The problem isn't just understanding *once heard*, but *hearing* in the first place.
* **D: Yëkëti baaraamu dëy mi:**  This translates to ""Only the deaf have this problem,"" which is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that people *with* hearing can also have trouble understanding, as evidenced by Oliver Sacks’ observations.



Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects the central theme of the passage: a difficulty in *hearing* and consequently, understanding."
Ban ci baat yii toop ci jëfinu xarkanam gu gàtt la firndeelam dëgguwul?,"The correct answer is **A: Dënkinu video yi yoobu na ci jëm kanam yu am solo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jëfandikoob dencug wideo buñuy aarësistere tax na bañu gis lu am solo ci wàllum firi wax ci mikoro yi...""  This directly translates to ""The proliferation of digital videos has made it possible for anyone to record and share content on platforms...""  This highlights the ease with which individuals can now create and distribute videos.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tekki bu baax mën na ràññee fen:** While the passage mentions good communication, it doesn't state that this is a result of the digital video boom.
* **C: Wax ak jëfinu xarkanam dañu leen di tekki:** The passage doesn't focus on *talking* about digital issues, but on the *creation* and *sharing* of videos themselves.
* **D: Mën na dimbali natt dëgguwaay:** The passage doesn't mention any change in social behavior, just the ability to record and share.



Therefore, option A best reflects the main point about the impact of digital videos as described in the passage."
Ban ci yii toop moo dem ba gëna am solo ndax Renaissance bi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Di wasaare xam-xam gi** (The pursuit of knowledge).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Renaissance dafa indi coppite gu am solo ci anam biñuy njànge ak tasaare xam-xam.""  This translates to ""Renaissance is looking for something new in the way we think and *the pursuit of knowledge*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Woowaat sa bopp** (Lost generations) - While the passage mentions older generations, it doesn't identify them as the focus of the Renaissance.
* **C: Fattëli lu ñu bind** (The things they hide) - The passage doesn't mention anything about hiding things.
* **D: Jot ay xebaar** (A different path) - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the core idea of the Renaissance as described in the passage.



"
"Ginaaw Renaissance, lan ci mbir yii lañu joxatul woon solo?","The correct answer is **B: Jot xam-xam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Renaissance dafa indi coppite gu am solo ci anam biñuy njànge ak **tasaare xam-xam**."" (Renaissance is starting to take root in things that have to do with **thinking/knowledge**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Woowaat sa bopp:** While the passage mentions ""woowaat"" (state/condition), it doesn't say Renaissance is focused on the state of people.
* **C: Fattëli lu ñu bind:** This refers to family ties, which isn't a focus of the passage.
* **D: Wasaare Xebaar:** This refers to spreading news, and while knowledge *can* be spread, the passage specifically emphasizes the *acquisition* and *development* of knowledge itself.



"
Ban ci mbir yii moo méngoowul ak bëgg-bëggu jëfandikoo internet ngir  wéyal ab diggante?,"The correct answer is **B: Jokkoog njaboot gi**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that things like ""di jàng"" (scams) and ""dëkkuwaay"" (false advertising) *exist* within the world of the Internet and are examples of problems found when navigating it.  It also mentions things like ""sa paspas"" (identity theft) and ""di weyeel diggente yi"" (inappropriate content) as risks. This all points to **exploiting vulnerabilities** or *jokkoog njaboot gi* (taking advantage of weaknesses) for malicious purposes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lënkëloo liggéey (Easy links):**  While links are *part* of the Internet, the passage doesn't discuss them as a problem.
* **C: Di wëra tukki (Lost time):** The passage focuses on harms and deception, not just wasted time.
* **D: Di dajeeg nit yu bées (Helping needy people):** The passage discusses negative aspects, not positive charitable activities.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone ap motivasyon di jëfëndikoo internet bi ngir sa jëfi bopp?,"The correct answer is **B: Bind ci ap waxtaan bu ñu ubbi ci internet bi** (Related to the desire to connect with others on the internet).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...*lënd gi nu mëna gis dafay yóbb ci ay yeneen yokkute ci jëfandikoo ak njëriñ joge*..."" (people are motivated by the desire to connect and interact with others).
* **It also gives examples:**  Like ""di jàng"" (chatting) and ""dëkkuwaay"" (discussion forums), showing ways people connect.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Wër ap toogë (They are bored):** While boredom *can* be a motivator, the passage focuses on social connection, not simply alleviating boredom.
    * **C: Di wër ay jumtukaayu wër gu yaram (They have good intentions):** The passage doesn't discuss intent, only motivation.
    * **D: Ni ngay topatoowee say koom-koom (If they have access to computers):** Access is a prerequisite, not a motivation.

Therefore, option B best reflects the core message about the motivation for using the internet described in the passage.



"
Kañ la Europu penku daggee di sukkëndiko bu baax ci royukaay yi te tambalee samp seen estilu bopp?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci biir jàmono Byzantine**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci ndortéelu solu gi royonna ci aada Byzantine ci pénku bi."" (The style originated in Byzantine art in the beginning.) This directly links the architectural style to the Byzantine period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci wétu mujjute Diggu àt ya:**  The passage mentions 25-30 years, but this is about the duration of construction, not the origin of the style.
* **C: Lu tool ci 25 àt yu toop ci Diggu àt ya:** Similar to A, this refers to construction time.
* **D: Ci biir 11 xarnu bi:** The passage doesn't mention anything specific about 11 centuries.



"
Di jëfëndikoo ay buton ngir teye yere nekkoon na lu juddoo ci lan? ,"The correct answer is **A: Diirup Gothic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Melokaanu Gotik am na doole ci jamono diggante fukkeel ak fukkeel ak benneelu xarnu yi ak fukkel ak ñeent xarnu bi.""  This translates to ""Gothic architecture is characterized by height and lightness and complex structures and detailed ornamentation.""
* The passage then *contrasts* Gothic architecture with Byzantine architecture.
* The question asks what allowed things to be built taller. Gothic architecture, with its innovations like pointed arches and flying buttresses, is known for enabling significantly taller structures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jàmonoog Byzantine:**  The passage presents Byzantine architecture as *preceding* and being *different* from Gothic, not as the innovation allowing for taller buildings.
* **C: Daje mbooloo yi:** (The rich) This is irrelevant to architectural techniques.
* **D: Diggu àt ya:** (Digging at it)  This is nonsensical in the context of architectural advancement.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moom la ñuy jappee ni ap saafara buy yagg ngir jafe jafe gàncax gi?","The correct answer is **B: Aktivism**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) describes a situation where people are suffering (""mettit wiy ñëw""), facing injustice (""nit ñi di yokkee ak anam bu ëpp""), and needing help. It then talks about the importance of working together (""bëggul saafara gu yàggul"") to achieve something (""gis reeni jafe jafe gi"").  This strongly suggests a call to action and organized effort to improve things – which is the core of **aktivism** (activism).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dog tànn dund yu fës (Simple everyday tasks):** The passage discusses far more than simple tasks; it highlights systemic problems and the need for significant change.
*   **C: Ràññee lu waral jafe jafe yi (Maintaining the current state of affairs):** The passage explicitly implies things *need* to change, not be maintained.
*   **D: Nekk ap xaritu mbooloom ñiy taxawal gàncax gi (Establishing a charitable organization to solve the problem):** While charity *could* be part of a solution, the passage emphasizes collective action and addressing the root causes, going beyond simply providing aid.



Therefore, **aktivism** best encapsulates the spirit and message of the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci saafara yii toop la ñu dul jàppee ni ap saafara buy faj luy wone jafe jafe yi te du faj lu ko waral?","The correct answer is **B: Dog reenub jafe jafe yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) heavily focuses on the suffering and injustice faced by people, especially those marginalized and lacking resources.** It speaks of needing help, the difficulties of life, and the power structures that keep people down.  The core concern is *addressing* those injustices.
* **Option B, ""Dog reenub jafe jafe yi"" (Advocating for the suffering/difficulties of people), directly reflects this central theme.** It's about giving voice to those who are hurting and working to improve their situation.

Let's look at why the other options are less fitting:

* **A: Soobu ci aktivism (About activism):** While advocating *is* a form of activism, the passage isn't *about* activism as a concept. It's about the *need* for action to address suffering.
* **C: Joolil xalaat yu jëm ci tann dundin bu fës (Analyzing problems rooted in fast life/modernity):**  The passage discusses broader societal issues than just those tied to ""modern life."" It speaks of fundamental inequalities.
* **D: Dund ci ap gàncax-bu leen dalal jàmm (Discussion about how to achieve peaceful coexistence):** While peaceful coexistence might be a *result* of addressing the issues raised, the passage primarily focuses on the problems themselves, not the solutions for harmony.



**In essence, the question (Q) asks what the passage is *about* at its heart, and the answer is the plight of those suffering and the need to support them – precisely what Option B captures.**"
Ci ban réew la xare bu njëkk mi ci Europe amoon bu jafe jafeem bu rëy waxoon nañu ni mo doon tolëlewu kàttan te baña am ap kilifteef diiné?,"The correct answer is **D: Espaañ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xare Ndono bi amoon ci Espagne mooy xare bu njëkk bo xam ni liko waralon mooy tollale doole yi.""  This translates to ""The Spanish War was the first war known where the main issue was the tolerance of religions.""  The question asks which country had the first major religious war in Europe, and the passage directly identifies Spain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Angalteer (England):** While England had religious conflicts, they weren't the *first* major one in Europe as described in the text.
*   **B: Almaañ (Germany):** The Thirty Years' War is mentioned as a particularly devastating war, but not as the first religious war.
*   **C: Portugaal (Portugal):**  The text doesn't mention Portugal in connection with the first major religious war.



"
Ban xare la ñuy yeeni saay ràññëlee ni xare diiné bu mujj?,"The correct answer is **C: Xareb suksesion Español (War of the Spanish Succession)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions the War of the Spanish Succession as an example of a war triggered by inheritance issues (""doole"").**  It states ""Xare Ndono bi amoon ci Espagne mooy xare bu njëkk bo xam ni liko waralon mooy tollale doole yi."" (The War of the Spanish Succession that occurred in Spain was the first war one understands where the cause was inheritance issues.)
* The passage also highlights how inheritance disputes (""doole"") often led to conflicts between European powers.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Xare fanweeru àt ya (War of the Austrian Succession):** While a war of succession, it isn't the one specifically referenced in the text.
    * **B: Xare téeméeri àt ya (War of the Bavarian Succession):** This is a less significant and not mentioned in the passage.
    * **D: Xare siwil Español (Spanish Civil War):** This war happened much later and was not a war of succession.



"
Ban ci mbir yii toop bu jàngu katolik bi la ñu dul woon gëstuwaat?,"The correct answer is **A: Bu nekkoon ni seedële alal ci biir jàngu bi nekkoon na lu war.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Alal bi dañ ko wara jëfandikoo ngir wàññi coonoy ñàkk te xaalisi jangu yi ngir loolu kese lañ koy jëfandikoo."" This translates to ""The law allowed them to conquer new lands and evangelize people, and for this reason they conquered.""  This directly implies that a motivation for the Catholic Church's actions was to expand its influence and convert people. Option A reflects this – they sought to establish laws (and thus control) in the lands they conquered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bu nekkee ni yoonu diiné yu gëna rëy dañu leen a wara alamaan:** The text doesn't specifically mention helping other religions or seeking understanding. It focuses on conversion and expansion.
* **C: Booloowu kàttan ci biir Jàngu bi:** The passage doesn't discuss specific building projects or physical contributions.
* **D: Bu nekkee ni yoonu Jàngu bi yu gëna rëy yëpp dañu leen mattal:** This focuses on helping existing rulers, which isn't the primary focus of the text. The text describes *conquering* and converting, not aiding existing power structures.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan la ñu boomoon ca Versailles?","The correct answer is **A: Benn ci soxna yuy jaay ci marse bi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ci bisu 6 oktoobar 1789 la ko ay jigeen yuy liggéey ci màrse bi fitnaloon mu dellu ca Paris bawoo Versailles.""  This translates to ""...on October 6, 1789, the king and his family moved to Marseilles, leaving Paris and Versailles behind.""  Therefore, they *moved* from Versailles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Buur Louis XVI** - Louis XVI is *who* moved, not *where* they moved from.
*   **C: Kenn ku bokk ci mbooloo mi doon ñaxtu** - This is too vague and doesn't directly answer the question of where they moved from.
*   **D: Ap gaard** - The text doesn't mention a guard being the reason for the move.



"
Ban ci yii toop la mbooloom ñu doon ñaxtu forséwul woon ci kaw Buur bi ak Lingéer bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ubbitéwu palanteeru seen woto** (They wanted to move them forward/make them progress).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mbooloom nit ñi forsé na buur bu góor bi ak bu jigeen bi ñu ubbi palanteeru oto bi."" This directly translates to ""The people forced the king and queen, they wanted to make them progress.""  ""Palanteeru"" in this context means to push them towards a desired change or action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap génne bu gaaw ci Versailles:** The text doesn't mention a specific desire for a comfortable life at Versailles. It focuses on *forcing* a move *from* Versailles.
* **C: Wone nu ñu doon daggee boppu gaard yi:** While they did eventually move to Paris and were under guard, the initial *reason* for the forced move wasn't just about guards; it was about influencing the king and queen.
* **D: Ap tukki deluwaat ca Paris:**  Moving to Paris was a *result* of the forcing, not the initial desire driving it.



"
Ban ci yii toop nekkul lu jogee ci xeexub gaal yi bu Angalteer fu ñu mënoo na jëfëndikoo bepp faanu gànnaay?,"The correct answer is **A: Almaañ bëggoon na jëfëndikoo ay faanu xare yu mingoo** (Germany wanted to defend its large overseas possessions).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Germany xaaronna tontu buni mél ci séni xééx kat yi ci géej gi."" This translates to ""Germany had a big interest in its colonial possessions in the world."" This directly implies a desire to *defend* those possessions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay gaal yu ci bokkulwoon yakkoon nañu leen:** (Those in power would have them as allies) - The passage doesn't discuss alliances.
* **C: Indiwoon nañu ay copite ci yoon yi ci biir àddina bi yëpp:** (They would give them copies of the laws of former nations) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Mënu ñu woon a jot ci lekk gu ñu soxla woon lool:** (They were going to travel in the places they had exploited the most) - While exploitation is mentioned, the passage doesn't say they planned to travel there.



"
Ban baat moo dul wone blokaasu gaalu Angalteer ak Almaañ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mu dem bay tëkku ay yoon yu ñu tërël ci àddina bi yëpp**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a naval blockade by England against Germany.** It states England exploited its position to control sea routes and prevent goods from reaching Germany. This aligns with the idea of ""taking action based on agreements in the past"" - the agreements being the laws of war and the strategic goals of England.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moo junj xare gaalu Almaañ yi** (It just spoiled the Germans) - The passage focuses on a *blockade* which is about *preventing* things, not spoiling.
* **C: Mu dagg lekk bu ñu doon yoobul Almaañ** (It just wanted to make Germany suffer) - While the blockade *caused* suffering, the passage frames it as a strategic move for control, not just malicious intent.
* **D: Mu def ba gaal yu ci bokkul bañ cee dugg** (It defeated many important battles) - The passage doesn't describe battles; it describes a naval *blockade*.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, kan la ñuy jagleel testu sclérose yu bare?","The correct answer is **C: Ap goor gu am 43 àt**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ceytu yi wone na jigéeñ ñi ñoo ëpp ñaari yoon lu ñuy am MS jàngoro skeloris su nu leen mengalee ak góor ñi.""  This translates to: ""Most often it affects people between 20 and 40 years old.""  

Option C, ""Ap goor gu am 43 àt"" (It affects people around 43 years old), is the closest to the age range provided in the text. While 43 is slightly outside the 20-40 range, it's the most reasonable answer among the choices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ap soxna bu am 32 àt** (It affects people around 32 years old) - While within the range, it doesn’t reflect the 'most often' part.
*   **B: Ap goor gu am 15 àt** (It affects people around 15 years old) - This is too young, as the text implies it's more common in adults.
*   **D: Ap ndaw su jigéen su am 10 àt** (It affects people around 10 years old) - This is significantly too young.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ñu bokk ci ay aktviwite saa su nekk ñoo gënoona soxla ndimbël ngir lan?","The correct answer is **A: Gis gisu metit bu baaxul** (Good mental health).

Here's why:

The passage (P) discusses the importance of mental well-being (""xel bu wañekku""), dealing with difficulties (""fitna di lëkkale digante metit""), and seeking help (""mbir yu joge ci jëya kese""). It highlights the need for good mental health to cope with chronic illnesses and the challenges of life.

The question (Q) asks about activities that can help people, especially those experiencing difficulties. Good mental health (Gis gisu metit bu baaxul) is the fundamental basis for coping with those difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndig li** (Just sleep) - While sleep is important, it's not a comprehensive solution to mental and emotional challenges.
*   **C: Xel mu yëngëtu** (Beautiful mind) - This is a descriptive phrase, not an activity or practice.
*   **D: Ragal** (Rage/Anger) - Rage is a negative emotion and definitely not a helpful activity.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, naka la ñuy suwee eskrim?","The correct answer is **C: Ci tolluwaayu Olympik**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...ak jongante Olempiik."" (and participating in the Olympics). This directly links the sport being discussed to the Olympics.
* **The question (Q) asks:** Where did they practice fencing? (eskrim = fencing)
* **The passage describes a rigorous training regime for those aspiring to the Olympics.**  Therefore, the most logical place they would practice fencing would be at Olympic training facilities (""tolluwaayu Olympik"").

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ci ap nataal bu jàmonoog téy:** (In a small, simple place) - The passage describes a high-level training environment, not a simple one.
* **B: Ci tolluwaayu université:** (At university training) - While university training *could* be involved, the focus is on Olympic participation.
* **D: Ci ap melokaanu ñaar:** (In a public place) - This doesn't fit the described intensive, specialized training.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy doon luy wonale bu baax ap tooke ci biir?","The correct answer is **A: Xel guy téey ak tangooru yaram**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) warns about poison being put in drinks.** It specifically mentions the possibility of it being in containers or with toxic substances.
* **Question (Q) asks what is commonly done to drinks to make them bad.**
* **Option A (Xel guy téey ak tangooru yaram - Sugar and rum)**  While not *inherently* poisonous, adding things like excessive sugar or alcohol (rum) can make a drink dangerous or harmful, fitting the context of something being ""put in"" to ruin it.  It's a common way to adulterate a drink.
* **Option B (Woccu ak di ñaqq - Spices and salt)**  While these can affect taste, they generally don't make a drink *bad* in the sense of dangerous.
* **Option C (Ay metit yu meti lool ak ay metitu biir - Very small things and beer sediments)** This is irrelevant to the warning about poison.
* **Option D (Ap kayit fu ñu bind doom yi ngeen wara jël - People writing on drinks so they don't get stolen)** This is completely unrelated to the topic.

Therefore, option A is the most logical answer, aligning with the warning in the passage about something being added to a drink to make it harmful.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy jëf ju njëkk bu war gi boo leen di jege ap viktim?","The correct answer is **A: Gëstu bërëp bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is taking advantage of others' vulnerability and misfortune.** They are profiting from people in a difficult situation (those who have lost everything).
* **The question (Q) asks what kind of behavior is most characteristic of someone who preys on victims.**
* **""Gëstu bërëp bi"" (Exploitation)** directly describes the act of taking unfair advantage of someone.  It's the core action happening in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jege viktim bi (Being a victim)** - This describes *who* is affected, not the behavior of the perpetrator.
* **C: Gëstu taxawaayu viktim bi (Helping victims)** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **D: Xaar ndimbël gi (False appearance)** - While deception might be *part* of the scheme, it doesn't encompass the full act of exploiting someone's misfortune for profit.



"
Ban ci baat yii nekkul di wone bu baax nuñuy gëstuwee ap viktim?,"The correct answer is **B: Demal ca bërëp ba balaa viktim bi**.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a situation where someone is being exploited (lóru) and taken advantage of (wara njëkka saytu barab bi).** They are being used for their work and are suffering hardship (bépp darapo bu xonk). The text emphasizes the feeling of being trapped and exhausted (defoo ludul yokk jafe-jafe bi).

* **Option B (""Demal ca bërëp ba balaa viktim bi"") translates to ""Exploiting people who are already vulnerable victims.""** This perfectly aligns with the description in P's text.  The person being described is *already* in a difficult situation (vulnerable) and is being further exploited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bul topatoo lii di teye say metitu bopp** - This talks about a debt or obligation, which isn’t the central theme.
* **C: Gëstul taxawaayu viktim bi** - This implies rescue or helping victims, which is the *opposite* of what's happening.
* **D: Jeemala ràññee bepp tektal bu fës** - This speaks about living in fear, which is a consequence of the exploitation, but doesn't capture the act of exploitation itself.



"
Ban ci copite yu Revolution Française bi junj amoon ap jëf bu am solo ci sitwayin yiy liggéey?,"The correct answer is **C: Jël ap xalaatu Republicain**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ginaw tamit biñu ubbe yëngu yëngu yi ngir góor yi doon laaj ñu nangul leen ñi gënna sañ ak am ndam ñu am ndam... Revolution bu Farans bi dafa bayyilo xel itam yeneen kalaasu liggéeykat yu yeneen réew yi ngir tambali seen coppitey bopp."" This translates to something like: ""These efforts were made to help those who were poor and those who had nothing...The French Revolution inspired ideas in many countries to change their constitutions.""  The core shift was *away* from absolutism *towards* a Republic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yokkal ndimbël gi ngir askan yi (Reducing burdens for rulers):** The Revolution was *against* the rulers, not for them.
* **B: Ap copite jublukaay joge ci kalaas dem ci mën mën (Constitutions focusing on class struggles):** While class was a factor, the overarching goal was a fundamental change in governance *to* a Republic.
* **D: Ap sistemu nattukaay bu bees (A less complex system):** The Revolution aimed for a different *type* of system, not necessarily a simpler one.



Therefore, the best answer is **C**, as it reflects the core constitutional change brought about by the French Revolution – the establishment of Republican ideals."
"Di toop Revolution Française bi, ndam ci xarekat yi ak yeneeni liggéey yi tegu wu ñu woon ci lan?","The correct answer is **B: Kalaas**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states: ""Revolution bu Farans bi dafa bayyilo xel itam yeneen kalaasu liggéeykat yu yeneen réew yi ngir tambali seen coppitey bopp.""  This translates to ""The French Revolution influenced the ideas of different classes in different countries to change their respective constitutions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndam** - While ""ndam"" (people) are involved in revolutions, the passage specifically highlights the impact on *classes* of people.
*   **C: Am gëm gëm** - This means ""much trouble"" and isn't the focus of the sentence.
*   **D: Kalibar** - This refers to the caliber of weapons and is mentioned in a different context within the passage, not directly related to the Revolution's impact.



"
Ban servis publik la ñu wax ni mooy indi ñakk mbégte bu rëy ci réew yuy meññ?,"The correct answer is **C: Wallub dem ak dikk bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses problems with services and the relationship between people and authorities.** It specifically mentions difficulties (""nekk dafay dugal loxoom..."") and the need for improvement (""ku nekk dafay njaxtu..."") in how services are delivered.
* **""Wallub dem ak dikk bi"" translates to ""relationship between people and authorities.""** This directly addresses the core issue presented in the passage – the quality of interaction and service provided by public entities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalite ndox (Quality of people):** While important, the passage isn't focused on the *people* providing the service, but the *service itself* and the interaction with those receiving it.
* **B: Tabax ay pom (Many problems):**  The passage *identifies* problems, but the question asks what the overarching *topic* of those problems is.
* **D: Njàngale bi (Mistakes):**  Mistakes are a *result* of issues within the system, not the central concept being discussed.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer to the question, aligning directly with the concerns raised in the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu mëna wax jëm ci doxalinu dem ak dikk bi?","The question asks about the reasons people might exploit societal structures for personal gain, and whether this is a new phenomenon or has always existed. It asks specifically about whether people are becoming more brazen or if it's simply more visible now.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Kepp ku leen di jëfëndikoo bëgg nañu leen lool** (It's because they want to defend what belongs to them) - This doesn't address the *exploitation* of systems, just a desire to protect possessions.
* **B: Bonu ñu ni kalite ndox mi** (They have the quality of societal flaws) - This is a bit abstract and doesn't explain *why* people exploit the flaws.
* **C: Dañuy indi ay ñaxtu yu bare yuy joge ci ñu leen di jëfëndikoo** (It's because there are people who are very skillful at exploiting what belongs to them) - This directly addresses the exploitation aspect.  It acknowledges that some people are good at taking advantage of systems.
* **D: Ci réew yuy méññ yi jaruñu fa lenn** (In countries with flaws, it is easy to do) - This explains *where* it happens, not *why* people do it.

**Therefore, the best answer is C.** It best answers the question by pointing to the skills and inclinations of individuals who exploit systems for their own benefit.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop ñoo mëna metee natt ndax dowalkat yu ñu mënuta nand?","The correct answer is **A: Dowalin bu gaaw gi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sant Yalla, dawalkat yi tàmm nañu di doxalee yoon, kon ni woto yi di ñëwee ab nanu tolluwaay bu jaar yoon te mën nanu leen nataal ci xayma."" This translates to ""Fortunately, vehicles often follow the rules, but drivers sometimes disregard them entirely and drive recklessly on the road.""  This directly relates to **dowalin bu gaaw gi** (reckless driving) as a problem discussed in the passage regarding traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Palangu tali yi** (Traffic lights) - While traffic lights are *part* of traffic flow, the passage isn't focusing on malfunctions or problems *with* the lights themselves, but rather how people *use* them (or don't).
* **C: Jëfëlinu tali yi** (Road signs) - Similar to traffic lights, the passage isn't about the signs themselves, but driver behavior.
* **D: Nu dowal bi mel** (Normal driving) - This is the opposite of the problem described in the passage. The passage highlights *problematic* driving, not normal driving.



"
Ban ci yii toop mooy bu ñuy jëfëndikoo ngir teewal dem ak dikk bi ci ay araf?,"The correct answer is **B: Jëfinu dowalkat** (Understanding the flow).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on understanding ""traffic flow"" (mooy njàngum yëngu yëngu dawamakat yi ak woto yi).**  It talks about how vehicles move, how congestion happens, and the characteristics of traffic.
* The question asks what we're trying to do to improve movement and avoid problems in roads.  Understanding how traffic *flows* is the fundamental first step to achieving that.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Jëfëlinu tali yi (Understanding signals):** While signals are *part* of traffic flow, the passage doesn't focus on them specifically.
    * **C: Defaru tali (Defining signals):**  Even more specific than signals, and not the primary concern of the text.
    * **D: Nu dem ak dikk bi baree (We move and go freely):** This is the *desired outcome*, but not what we do to *achieve* improvement.  Understanding flow comes first.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the passage's content."
Lan la Hershey ak Chase jëfëndikoo ngir samp seen ADN? ,"The correct answer is **A: Phosphore radioactif**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the phage. They reasoned that if DNA was the genetic material, the radioactive phosphorus would be found inside the bacteria after the phage infected them.  This is exactly what they observed, proving DNA was the carrier of genetic information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Matériel génétik (Genetic Material):** While the experiment *proved* DNA was the genetic material, it wasn't what they *used to track* it.
* **C: Sulfure radioactif (Radioactive Sulfur):** They used radioactive sulfur to label the *protein* coat of the phage, not the DNA.
* **D: Ay doomu jangoro (Some dangerous things):** This is irrelevant to the experiment's methodology.



"
Mën mën ngir ap copite wal ci doom yi ci lan la aaju?,"The correct answer is **B: Lu jumtukaay génétik amee solo**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (translated roughly to English):

""Copper is bad for health because it accumulates in the body, and excessive consumption can lead to health problems like diarrhea and even cancer. Copper only causes problems when it accumulates in the body, and copper intake can lead to cell damage or cancer.""

This text strongly suggests the problem with copper isn't the copper itself (like option D), nor just the amount (like option C). It's about *how* it affects the body - specifically leading to genetic mutations and cell damage.  Option B, ""Genetic mutations happen alone,"" aligns with the idea that copper's harmful effects are related to changes at a genetic level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Su selul yi nekke liñé germinale (Defective germline cells):** While cell damage is mentioned, the text doesn’t specifically link it to germline cells.
*   **C: Faanu copite bi (Copper poisoning):**  The text speaks to accumulation and long-term effects, not immediate poisoning.
*   **D: Ndax copite bi mën na tax selul yi dee (Copper damages cells):** While true according to the text, it doesn't explain the *root cause* of the damage, which is the implied genetic disruption.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar yu ñu joxe ci lu ñu bind, ci lan la mbirup copite yu wuute yi dul sukkëndiku?","The correct answer is **A: Ñaata ci matériel génétik bi la ñu laal** (Mutations in the genetic material they inherit).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P) and the question (Q):

* **The text (P) states:** Coppite (mutations) are a cause of disease, and can lead to cancer. It implies these mutations are *inherited* (""coppite yi mën na am xeet jëf yu wuute..."").
* **The question (Q) asks:** What causes the predisposition to diseases that people are born with?  (i.e., inherited diseases)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bu nekkee ni selul yu ñu laal dañoo nekk liñé germinale:** This talks about damage to germline cells, which *can* cause inherited mutations, but isn't the direct *cause* of the predisposition itself. It's a mechanism *leading* to the mutation.
* **C: Nu marériel génétik yu ñu laal amee solo:**  This doesn't make sense in the context of disease predisposition.  ""Solo"" implies something is alone or isolated, which isn't a cause of inherited problems.
* **D: Faanu copite yu ñu laal:**  This is too broad. While inherited mutations *are* a type of ""copite"" (mutation), the question asks about the underlying *reason* for the predisposition.



Therefore, **mutations in the genetic material inherited from parents** are the root cause of predisposition to inherited diseases, as suggested by the text."
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul woon li waral cosaan yu yàgg ya doon denc ay bëy?,"The correct answer is **B: Dañu doon dimbali ci lekk ñax yi** (They wanted to hide in the mountains).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bëyu kër yi danu leena dencoon ci ay gettë yu y wërci tund yi wala yeneen barab yu nuy lekkee ñax..."" which translates to ""Then the groups wanted to hide in the high, remote mountains..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañu doon joxe ndawal** (They wanted to find water) - The passage doesn't mention looking for water.
* **C: Dañu doon weetëli nit ñi** (They wanted to help people) - The passage focuses on hiding, not helping others.
* **D: Dañu doon joxe meew** (They wanted to find food) - While the passage mentions food (""lu yombu meew""), the primary purpose is hiding.



"
Jublukaayu golf mooy di jël njëg bu gëna ndawu lan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ay pax**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Golf am po la boo xam ne fokat yi dañuy jëfandikoo ay bant ngir **door bal yi ci ay pax**."" (Golf is a game where people compete for points among **the players**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bal:** While ""bal"" means point/score, the passage says players compete *for* points, not *are* points.
* **B: Attise:** This doesn't relate to the passage's discussion of golf.
* **C: Waxtu:**  ""Waxtu"" means time; the passage doesn't focus on timing in golf.

Therefore, the passage clearly defines golf as a competition *among the players* (**ay pax**).



"
"Ci njàngale wu golf, fan la ñu dogee ñax wi mu gëna gàtt?","The correct answer is **A: Ci fukk ak juroom ñeeteelu pax wi**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Fukk ak juroom gneti kamb amoonna ci pomu jar ci yoon, ak ay po kat yuy faral di door ci kamb gu njeek gi ci poomi té mujjé ci fukk ak juroom gnettél bi.""  This translates to ""Strength and skill are needed to hit the ball far, and some can't even hit it close to where they are standing, and others can hit it further with strength and skill.""  This directly connects hitting the ball well (gaining distance/accuracy) with *fukk ak juroom* (strength and skill).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci wert bi:** While the passage mentions the *wert* (value/worth) of practice, it doesn't say that's *how* they hit the ball far.
* **C: Ca pax wu njëkk ma:** This translates to ""at the first pace,"" and isn't a factor in how far one hits the ball.
* **D: Ci xaaj wu njëkk mi ci njàngale bi:** This translates to ""at the first feature of the game,"" and isn't relevant to the passage's focus on the qualities needed to hit well.

The passage (P) states that science is about testing ideas (xam) and that experiments are done to *confirm* or *refute* those ideas (hypothèses).  The purpose of experimentation is to see if what you *think* is true actually *is* true.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngir xam nu àddina bi di doxee:** While science *does* help us understand the world, the passage focuses on the *process* of testing, not just knowing the world.
* **C: Laaj ay laaj:**  ""Laaj"" means layers. The passage talks about levels of understanding but doesn't say the purpose of science is simply layers.
* **D: Ngir teete ay gëstu sientifik:** The passage describes the *purpose* behind scientific steps, not just doing the steps themselves.



Therefore, option A best reflects the core idea of the passage: science is used to validate or invalidate ideas/hypotheses."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo dul dimbëli teete ap gëstu sientifik?","The correct answer is **A: Doxalin sientifik bi kesse** (Applying scientific methods).

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states that science relies on *gestu* (methods/practices) and *experiaas* (experience). It emphasizes that scientific methods are used to understand the world and that these methods involve careful observation, experimentation, and analysis to arrive at knowledge. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di def ay seetlu (Defining observations):** While observations are *part* of the scientific method, they aren't the method itself.
* **C: Dindi ay hyphothèse yu mëna am (Formulating meaningful hypotheses):**  Hypotheses are important, but the passage focuses on the broader *application* of the scientific approach, not just hypothesis creation.
* **D: Teete ay gëstu (Doing actions/things):** This is too vague.  The passage specifies *scientific* actions/methods.



Therefore, applying scientific methods – *doxalin sientifik bi kesse* – is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci tornade moo dëgguwul?","The correct answer is **B: Tornade yi dañuy dal ay bërëp yu gëna ndaw wuuteeg yeneen ngelaw yu metee meti yi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tampet yi dañoo daanel garab yi xotti plansu kër yi te sànni ndaamar yi ci asamaan si."" This translates to ""Storms can destroy houses and lift objects into the sky."" This directly relates to tornadoes picking up debris.
* **The passage also states:** ""Ngélawu yu am doolé yii dawnagnu ci 480km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" This implies the strong winds associated with tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While tornadoes *can* be unpredictable, the passage doesn't focus on their unpredictability.
* **C:**  The passage doesn't mention how long tornadoes last.
* **D:**  The passage mentions speed (480km/h) but doesn't specifically say tornadoes travel *with* airplanes at that speed, nor a distance of 300 meters.  It's the *wind* within the tornado that reaches that speed.



Therefore, option B best reflects the information provided in the passage."
"Di sukkëndiiku ci lu ñu wax, ban ci baat yii toop mooy wone bu baax lu ëp ci tornade yi?","The correct answer is **B: Dañuy sàkk ngelaw guy ëf ba 480 meetar ci waxtu** (It can travel like an airplane, flying 480 meters in a second).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngélawu yu am doolé yii dawnagnu ci 480km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)."" This directly relates to their speed and ability to ""fly.""
* **The question asks about what's impressive about what's said.** The incredibly high speed is the most striking and noteworthy detail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañuy tàmm di yagg ba romb ñeeti waxtu** (It can stay in the air for a long time) - The passage doesn't mention duration in the air.
* **C: Dañuy laal ay bërëp yu gëna rëy wuuteeg yeneeni taw yu metee meti yi** (It has shiny scales that reflect the light of the setting sun) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Mën nañoo budee ay garab ci suuf si** (They build nests in the sky) - The passage mentions them damaging roofs, but not building nests.



"
Ban ci yii toop la nit ñi tambalee def ci xarnub 16 bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Di defar ay teleskop** (They are discovering telescopes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Telescope yi ñu njëkka defar ñu ngi leen defaree Europe ci njeexte 16eelu xarnu bi."" (Telescopes are being discovered and will be sent to Europe in the next 16 years.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di jëfëndikoo ay lentiy (They are discovering lenses):** While the passage mentions lenses *being used in* the telescopes, the main discovery is of the telescopes themselves.
* **B: Di rëyël ay jumtukaay (They are realizing journeys):** This has nothing to do with the passage.
* **C: Di defar ay lentiy (They are discovering lenses):**  Again, lenses are a component, not the main discovery.



"
Ci ñaata diir la nit ñi di rëyël ay jumtukaay ci di jëfëndikoo ay lentiy?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci diiru ay junni àt**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Telescope yi dañu daan jëfandikoo ñaari lentille su ko defee muy jegeel mbir yu sori ba noppi gën leen rëyal."" (Telescopes are used to observe many lenses that are very small and make them real.)
* **The question asks:** ""Ci ñaata diir la nit ñi di rëyël ay jumtukaay ci di jëfëndikoo ay lentiy?"" (What is the reason people make lenses real by observing them?)
* The passage implies the reason is to see *many* lenses – ""ñaari lentille"" translates to ""many lenses"". ""Diiru ay junni àt"" means ""many things"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci diirub ñaari junni àt** – This is close, but ""diirub"" changes the meaning slightly and isn’t the core reason stated in the text.
* **B: Ci mujjute xarnu 16 bi** – The 16th century is mentioned in the context of where the telescopes are being pointed *from*, not the reason for observing lenses.
* **D: Ci tambalinu xarnu 16 bi** – Similar to B, the 16th century is about location, not the purpose.

"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, lan la paxu Muhomet di wax ci ay jëfi diineem walla ngëm?","The correct answer is **C: Dafa soxlawoon ay waxtu yu neew fu mu nekkee moom dong.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kaaf gi ci boppa, te mu mucc ci yàggaay, dafay xalme lu bari ci ngëmuyonentu Muhammad (psl).""  This translates to ""The Qur'an, and he died in Medina, he was very generous to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).""
* **This indicates** that he (the person being discussed) was generous and supportive *after* learning from and believing in Muhammad. He didn't just passively receive information; he *acted* on his newfound faith.  Option C captures this idea of actively living out what he learned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dafa fonk jàmm ak togee boor:** (He had a strong relationship with old beliefs) - The passage doesn't focus on his previous beliefs, but his change *after* encountering Islam.
* **B: Sori coow mën na dimbali gëstu:** (He was a quiet man in matters of governance) - The passage doesn't mention anything about governance or his personality in that regard.
* **D: Dafa jaaxlewoon ci ñu koy gis te di ko degg:** (He would listen to others and understand them) - While good qualities, the passage doesn't highlight this; it emphasizes his active support of the Prophet.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu doon njëkk a jëfëndikoowee weñ?","The correct answer is **D: Ay raay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci 1767, ci lañu njëkka dugal raayu weñ yi."" This translates to ""In 1767, in the year one dugal (a unit of measurement) raayu (rail) weñ yi (the rails).""  This directly indicates that the rails were being replaced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay yoonu raay:** While ""yoonu raay"" means ""railways,"" the text is talking about *replacing* the rails themselves, not the railway systems.
*   **B: Ay yoonu wagon:**  The text mentions wagons, but doesn't say they were being replaced.
*   **C: Ay pënë:** ""Ay pënë"" means ""the sleepers/ties,"" and the text doesn't mention replacing those.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu tax ñu wecci ay pënë bant ak ay pënë weñ?","The correct answer is **D: Dañu doon yakku ndax weñ wi ci raay yi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci lu gaaw, dañoo wuutale ay pono bànt ak ay pono weñ."" This directly translates to ""In the end, they mixed black people with white people.""  This mixing happened *because* the white people were taking advantage of the black people.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Gaawaayu fas yi yooku:** (The slave trade was strong) - While true in context, it doesn't answer *how* they mixed the people.
    * **B: Dañu jappoon ni ñoo gënoo na baax:** (They thought they were doing well) -  This is a subjective interpretation and not explicitly stated as the *reason* for the mixing.
    * **C: Amoon nañu kàttanu gaddu ay yen yu gëna yaatu:** (They wanted to create beautiful eyes) - This is not mentioned in the text and is an irrelevant detail.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and directly answers the question based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo jubënti nit ñi diirub jàmono mbëggeel?","The correct answer is **D: Cosaan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci jamonoy Romantism, melosuuf bi dafa defaraat nit ñi, te ni jamono di doxee ak **cosaan** bu méngook loolu..."" (In the era of Romanticism, philosophy dealt with people, and this era was concerned with **feeling** intensely...)
* The question asks what the passage identifies as being a key aspect of the Romantic era.  The passage directly links Romanticism to *cosaan* (feeling/emotion).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yoon yi (The year):** The passage discusses an era, not a specific year.
* **B: Yeografi (Geography):** Geography is not mentioned in the context of defining Romanticism in the passage.
* **C: Duwaan yi (Religions):** While religion *could* be connected to Romanticism, the passage doesn't focus on it.



"
Ban ci baat yii toop ñoo dul wone ap xalaat bu yaatu jëm ci xalaat bii ñuy foogee ni copite teknik nekk na lu jogewul ci askan wi? ,"The correct answer is **C: Teknolosi am na ay jëfin ci biir askan wi** (Technology has effects on the future of work).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses how technology (specifically ""xarala"" - which translates to technology/information) is changing work and the skills needed.** It talks about needing to learn new things to stay relevant in the job market (""xalaat bu am solo ak ay yoonu xamxam ak seeni fesal am ci xarala"").  It also mentions automation replacing jobs (""auto yu néew ñooy dugal xaalis"").
* **Option A** is too broad. While technology *is* influencing the future of work, the passage doesn't focus on simply *having* a future of work.
* **Option B** is about technology making things easier, which isn't the core point of the passage. The passage emphasizes the *changes* technology brings, not just simplification.
* **Option D** focuses specifically on the political impact, while the passage discusses broader societal and work-related impacts.

Therefore, **C** best captures the central idea of the passage: technology *has effects* (jëfin) on the *future of work* (biir askan wi).



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo bokkul ak tàllal fiitukaay bi?","The correct answer is **C: Ap baat bu gëna dëggër**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a difference in the sound (""arc"") of playing ""up bow"" (màandargay) versus ""down bow"" (dow bow).**  It states the ""arc bu jëm"" (sound of up bow) is ""faral di gëna néew coow"" (a light, gentle sound) and ""arc bu jëm suuf"" (sound of down bow) is ""gëna bari coow"" (a strong sound).  This directly relates to the *quality* of the sound – whether it's light or strong, delicate or forceful – which is described as ""gëna dëggër"" (a delicate sound).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ap baat bu neex:** (It's a simple thing) - The passage describes a nuanced difference in sound, not something simple.
* **B: Ap mandarga buy mel ni ap takkalante:** (The musician plays well and understands) - The passage doesn't focus on the musician's skill, but the sound itself.
* **D: Tambalee ci suuf ni ap mboot:** (It depends on the down bow and the hand) - While the down bow is mentioned, the core point is the *difference in sound*, not just the technique.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop ñoo bokk ak baat bu neex?","The correct answer is **A: Ap fitukaay bu ñu jubël suuf**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes two types of bows:** ""up bow"" (màandargay) and ""down bow"" (dow bow).  It states these bows are used to play music (""misik moo leen taxa jog"").
* **The question asks what the bows are used for.**
* **Option A (""Ap fitukaay bu ñu jubël suuf"") translates to ""The instrument used to make sound.""** This directly relates to the passage's description of the bows' function in creating music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tàllal fitukaay bi (""The shape of the instrument"")** - The passage doesn't focus on the *shape* of the instrument, but its *function*.
* **C: Ap mandarga buy mel ni V (""The up bow is called V"")** - While the passage mentions ""up bow"" (màandargay) and ""V"", it doesn't state that ""V"" *is* the name of the up bow. It's simply a part of the description (""màandargay “up bow” bi dafa niroog ab V"").
* **D: Tambalee fu sa loxo teyee fiit wi (""Practice to improve your hand on the strings"")** -  While practice is implied, the passage doesn't specifically mention improving hand technique as the *purpose* of the bows.



"
Fosil yi dañuy wone ni ay loxo yu ñu defar ngir ñu jëfëndikoo leen ngir yan ci yii?,"The correct answer is **B: Yenu lu diis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yaxi fosil bu loxo bi te maggetaayam toll ci ñetti miliyoŋi at wone na coppite gi ci espisilitéwu loxo buy doxal mbir yi."" This translates to ""Fossil teeth have been found dating back several million years and show specializations in the teeth of primates that walk upright.""

The question asks what fossils show about the primates. The passage specifically says they show evidence related to *walking upright* (doxal mbir yi), which is the characteristic of *yenu lu diis* (bipedalism/walking on two feet).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jiitël:** (Skull) The passage doesn't focus on skulls.
*   **C: Lu ñuy dowal:** (Those that fall) This is irrelevant to the passage.
*   **D: Doxinu artikulasion:** (Articular joints) While joints are important for locomotion, the passage focuses on teeth as indicators of upright walking.



"
Ban ci yii toop ñooy wone bu baax falaanju golo? ,"The correct answer is **A: Dañoo gëna tàlleeku yu nit’** (They have characteristics of humans).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on hominids (early humans) and their evolutionary relationship to primates.** It states they share characteristics with primates but are distinct, and that fossils show their evolution over millions of years.
* **The question asks what is special about them.**  The passage implies their specialness lies in being *on the path to becoming humans* – possessing characteristics that eventually led to modern humans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Seeniy loxo ak seeniy tànk tooloo wu ñu ci jëm:** (Their bones and teeth are all the same) - The passage implies differences, mentioning evolution and distinct features.
* **C: Dañu leen di jëfëndikoo ngir yëkëti yen:** (They fight to unite with them) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Dañu leen di jëfëndikoo ngir jiitël:** (They fight to survive) - While survival is inherent in evolution, the passage doesn't specifically focus on fighting for survival.



"
Tànn gi dafay dindi copite genetik yu bees yi tambalee ban wet?,"The correct answer is **C: Segregasion**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the separation of genetic material (alleles) during gamete formation.** It mentions how characteristics are inherited (""bu nëbbu ak bu feeñ"" - inherited or acquired) and how genetic variations arise. This separation and redistribution of alleles is precisely what *segregation* refers to in genetics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nëbu (Inherited):** While inheritance is *discussed* in the passage, it doesn't answer the question of *how* genetic copies are separated.
* **B: Boolewaat (Mutation):** Mutations introduce *new* genetic variation, but they aren't the process of separating existing copies.
* **D: Wone (One):** This is just a single word and doesn't relate to the genetic process described.

**Therefore, ""Segregasion"" (Segregation) is the best answer because it accurately describes the process of separating genetic copies during reproduction, as explained in the passage.**



"
Ban doxalin mooy topatoo di dooli ay copite genetik?,"The correct answer is **A: Segregasion**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the separation of genetic material during reproduction – specifically, how traits are inherited from parents.** This is the core principle of *segregation* (separation). The passage talks about ""bu nëbbu ak bu feeñ"" (from mother and father) and how traits are passed down.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Boolewaat (Boolean):**  This relates to logic and computer science, not genetics.
    * **C: Copite (Copy):** While genetic material *is* copied, the passage focuses on the *separation* of that copied material, not the copying process itself.
    * **D: Wone (Want):** This doesn't relate to genetics at all.

**Segregation** in genetics refers to the separation of allele pairs during gamete formation (production of sperm and egg cells). This ensures that each gamete carries only one allele for each trait, allowing for genetic variation in offspring.  The passage directly describes this process.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bi ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii la ap primat di lekk ngir saafara “jafe jafe ñàkk proteine”?","The correct answer is **A: Ay xob yu dee**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mbir mi gëna am solo mi nit ñi mëna amee ci gàñcax gi mooy protéine yi nekk ci xobu yenn legume yi..."" (This part refers to proteins found in meat and legumes).  It then continues, ""...waaye yombul ci nit mu reesal proteine yooyu fileek toggu ñu leen."" (But it's important for people to get complete proteins, which they can find in...).  The passage then lists *melentaan, max, nen* (melons, maize, millet) as being insufficient, needing to be combined to get complete proteins and essential amino acids.
* **The question asks:** What is lacking in the diet that causes the need for ""jafejafe protein"" (combining foods)?
* **Therefore:** The passage implies that the ""jafejafe protein"" concept arises because *xob yu dee* (meat) provides complete proteins, while plant-based sources (legumes, melons, maize, millet) often need to be combined to provide all the necessary amino acids.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay legume yu ñu toggul:** Legumes are *part* of the problem, needing to be combined, not the thing that's lacking.
* **C: Ay njeereer:** The passage doesn't mention anything about needing to combine different meals.
* **D: Bantu ay toor-toor:** This option is irrelevant to the context of the passage.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci jafe jafe yii toop la dul ñàkk amino asid di indi?","The correct answer is **A: Jafe jafe ci diseere**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Itam, mënadi dëf li amna ay mujjantal yu diis: **ñakk xel, xiibon, ak mujje dee.**"" (And also, there are different types: white, black, and **red**).

The question asks which *jafe jafe* (beans) contain a complete set of amino acids. The passage implies red beans (""mujje dee"") are the most complete source.  Therefore, ""Jafe jafe ci diseere"" (beans that are red) is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ñakka lekk lu war:** (Beans that are white) - The passage doesn't suggest white beans are the most complete.
*   **C: Màggaay bu baaxul:** (Good source) - This is too general; the question asks for a *specific type* of bean.
*   **D: Dee:** (Red) - While ""dee"" means red, the full phrase ""Jafe jafe ci diseere"" is the more complete and correct answer, as it refers specifically to red *beans*.



"
Naka la ñu bokk ci ap cosaan di wonee saa su nekk seen bokk ci mbooloo mi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci di nangu yoon yu ñu tërël ci mbooloo mi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes people who are deeply involved in all aspects of life – religion, politics, culture, etc.** They discuss and are passionate about these things.  The phrase ""Ñi bokk ci aada bu ndaw dañ koy wone saa su né ci ay jëf yu wuuté, bokna ci jëfin, doxalin, ak waxin"" (Those in the younger generation often want to talk about important topics, argue, discuss, and express their opinions) directly supports this.
* **Option C (""Ci di nangu yoon yu ñu tërël ci mbooloo mi"" - They are interested in the ideas they believe in) best reflects this.** It captures the essence of people being engaged and passionate about their beliefs and wanting to discuss them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci di ko jeema jaxase (They just want to make fun of it)** - The passage doesn't suggest mockery or disrespect.
* **B: Ci di nangu gëm gëmu kepp ku leen wër (They just want to play games and waste their time)** - This is the opposite of the described behavior.
* **D: Ci di jëfëndikoo estil ni ap mandarga (They defend a style if someone criticizes it)** - This is too narrow; the passage describes engagement in *all* topics, not just defending a style.



"
"Jëm ci téori bu ñu wone ci lu ñu bind, lan moo mëna dal ap gone guy ràññële ku ak neewteeb xeet bu ñuy xolee ni ku am ay jëfin yuy fitnaal?","The correct answer is **A: Gone gi dina jeema moytu di bokk ci ay doxalin yuy fitnalaate.**

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** talks about societal norms and how people adapt to them, even if they aren't ideal. It describes how people often follow established paths (even flawed ones) rather than forging new ones.  It focuses on the *inertia* of tradition and the difficulty of breaking from it.

* **Q (the question)** asks about the theory behind why people continue to follow flawed customs or beliefs – even when they recognize their shortcomings.  It's asking about the reason for persistence in the face of known problems.

* **Option A** (""Gone gi dina jeema moytu di bokk ci ay doxalin yuy fitnalaate"" -  ""The problem often lies in the fact that it's easier to stay within existing frameworks"") directly addresses this inertia. It explains why people stick with what they know, even if it's not optimal.  It's about the *ease* of continuing with the current system, rather than the difficulty of change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** (""Gone gi dina ci bu leer bokk ci ay doxalin yuy fitnalaate"" - ""The problem often lies in being slow to adapt to existing frameworks"")  This doesn't fit. The passage isn't about *slow* adaptation, it's about continuing with something *despite* knowing it's flawed.
* **C:** (""Gone gi dina dem toog moom kesse ci waxtu ndaje mbooloo"" - ""The problem often comes later and manifests over a long period of time"")  This is about timing, which isn't the main point of the passage.
* **D:** (""Gone gi dina baña booloo ak yeneeni xeet yu neew yi"" - ""The problem often stems from being content with old beliefs"") While contentment *can* be a factor, the passage emphasizes the *difficulty* of changing paths, not simply being happy with the status quo.



Therefore, **A** best captures the central idea of the passage in relation to the question."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, xam-xamu gone jëm ci xalaat yu jëm ci ap xeet mën na jëf ci yan faan yii di toop?","The correct answer is **A: Xeet gu neew gu ñu tànn mingool**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the importance of stories and traditions.** It highlights how stories are passed down through generations, carrying cultural knowledge and values.  The example given is about how stories explain the origins of things and teach lessons.
* **The question (Q) asks about what stories do, specifically related to their longevity and relevance.**  It asks what makes stories *important* or *lasting*.
* **Option A (""New stories that are told often"")** directly addresses this.  Stories gain importance and survive through repetition and continued telling. This aligns perfectly with the passage's emphasis on oral tradition and passing down knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Seen jëfin (Old stories):** While stories *are* often old, the question isn't about age, it's about *why* they matter.
* **C: Seen diggënte ak yeneen gone yi (Stories that are different with each generation):** While stories *may* evolve, the core message and transmission are more central to the passage.
* **D: Nuñuy firndelee xeet (We quickly forget stories):** This is the opposite of what the passage conveys! The passage emphasizes remembering and passing down stories.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer because it focuses on the ongoing *telling* of stories, which is the key to their continued significance as described in the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo mingoowul ak màggaayu gone gu wex?","The correct answer is **A: Di dund yow kesse**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the suffering of animals – those that are sick, old, or injured. It talks about how they are often abandoned or mistreated. The phrase ""Amna ci ñoo xamni rabu àll yi ñoo leen yar bañu màgg"" translates to ""Many people don't care about them and let them suffer.""  The passage then says ""Sudee mala yu nitewul moo leen yar ci lépp"" meaning ""Often people don't care for them at all.""

* **Di dund yow kesse** translates to ""It's a great pity"" or ""It's very unfortunate,"" which directly reflects the sorrow and concern expressed about the animals' suffering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mën mënu waxtaan gu rëy:** This translates to ""It's a very beautiful story"" - the passage is *not* beautiful, it's about suffering.
* **C: Tàmm di dess moom dong:** This translates to ""It's time to finish this matter"" – irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Ragala booloog nit ñi:** This translates to ""The needs of people"" - the passage focuses on animal needs, not human ones.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy wone jëfinu ap gone gu rëb?","The correct answer is **C: Jëfin yu rëb ci gone yu seeniy waajur doon tej la ëpee.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ci benn fane, bayyi biñu bayyi xale bobu mingui laalu ci waajur yu mënul nangu laago bu meeti ci xel wala jëmm bi xale bi am."" This translates to ""sometimes, many animals live among the places people frequently visit, often settling near thoughts or the feelings of the people there.""  This directly relates to animals finding refuge in places connected to human experience and memory – essentially, ""gone yu seeniy waajur doon tej la ëpee"" (places frequented by people who have passed through).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't focus on *how* they arrive, but *where* they settle.
* **B:** While interaction with people is mentioned (being abandoned or helped), the core idea isn't about their relationship *with* people, but their choice of dwelling.
* **D:** The passage doesn’t mention anything about wallum bopp (distant lands) or relating the animals' settling to a specific direction.

* **The passage (P) discusses the importance of libraries (""mbay"") for research (""njureefam"") and knowledge (""baykat"").** It highlights how libraries preserve information and make it accessible.
* **Question (Q) asks about the function of libraries in relation to knowledge and information.**
* **Option A (""Jublu ci ap payoor miy mattal soxla njabootu baykat yi"" - ""Contribute to the preservation of valuable resources for researchers"") directly reflects this function.** Libraries *do* contribute to preserving resources for researchers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di defar lekk ngir jaay ko ñeneen ñi (""It provides access for those who want it"")** - While libraries *do* provide access, this doesn't capture the core function of preservation and being a resource for study highlighted in the passage.
* **C: Jublu ci payoor bu kawe mi bokkul ak teknik bu yees (""Contribute with modern resources and advanced techniques"")** -  The passage doesn't focus on modernity or technology, but the fundamental role of preserving knowledge.
* **D: Wut ay peep ci diwaanu baykat yi (""Holds many people in library halls"")** - This refers to the physical aspect of a library and doesn't relate to its purpose.

Ban ci yii toop mooy wone bu baax jëfëndikoowu mbay ngir mëna dund?,"The correct answer is **B: Dafay jëfëndikoo ay tekniku boppam ngir goob lu bare**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on the importance of navigating/sailing (mbay) and the skills (baykat) needed for it.** It highlights how skills are crucial for survival and success, particularly referencing Dundee (a place known for its maritime history).
* **The question (Q) asks what is most important for successfully navigating.** 
* **Option B** directly addresses this by stating the importance of *techniques* (tekniku) for *successful sailing* (goob lu bare). This aligns perfectly with the passage's central theme.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nekk na lu jëm ci lekk mu jogee ci mbay** - This translates to ""There is something valuable in the story about navigating."" While true, it doesn't answer *what* is most important for success.
* **C: Dafay may baykat yi ñu seedo lu ñu goob ci biir dëkk bi yëpp** - This focuses on the *learning* of skills, not the skills themselves being essential for success.
* **D: Yenn baykat yi ci yenn askan yi ñungi koy jëfëndikoo** - This suggests some skills are less important than others, which isn't the main point of the passage – the passage emphasizes the overall *need* for skills.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided text."
Di seeti ap musée dina tegu ci ban faanu turism?,"The correct answer is **A: Turism ngir liggéey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on cultural tourism.** It talks about people wanting to learn about history and traditions (""xam taarix bi ak aada bi"").  Museums are directly related to learning about history and culture.
* **""Liggéey"" means to learn or to educate oneself.**  This aligns with the purpose of visiting museums as described in the text – to understand the history and customs of a place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Turism ngir dalu (Tourism for fun):** While tourism *can* be for fun, the passage specifically highlights the educational and cultural aspect.
* **C: Turism cosaan (Costly tourism):** The passage doesn’t mention anything about the cost of tourism.
* **D: Turism genn ci biti (Tourism that builds on the past):** While understanding the past *is* important, ""liggéey"" more directly captures the act of *learning* about it which is the focus of the passage in relation to museums.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo mëna nekk lu gëna am solo ngir tukkikat yu koy def ngir peex mi walla yeneeni aktivite?","The correct answer is **C: Di gis ay mandarga yu am solo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Li tax nit di sééti bénn beereeb mooy dafa bëggee xam taarix bi ak aada bi kon séétsi boobu mooy séétuk aada."" (Those who seek to learn often come to learn the history and culture, and in doing so, preserve the culture.) and ""Turist yi mën nañu dem xooli ay gindikaay ci ap réew buñu tànn wala men nanu tànn nekk ci benn pàcc kese."" (Tourists often come to learn about the countries they visit, whether they have visited them before or not.)

This directly implies that tourists are interested in *finding things to do* and *learning* - which aligns with ""Di gis ay mandarga yu am solo"" (Finding activities to do on your own).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soob seen bopp ci cosaanu bërëp bi** (Most are interested in the cost of transportation) - The passage doesn't focus on cost.
* **B: Jël ap diir ngir nopali ku ci lu ñu tàmm di def** (It's a good place to relax and get away) - While relaxation *could* be a benefit, the passage emphasizes learning and cultural immersion.
* **D: Xam ap bërëpu taariix** (Learning about history) - This is *part* of what tourists do, but not the overarching reason for seeking activities. They seek activities *that allow* them to learn history.



"
Lu ñu maas ci wax ji ni lenn lu dimbali wàññi ragalu copite ci biir jàngu bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Fatëliku ay misaalu ndamu jëfi entreprenër** (Examples like the entrepreneur mentioned).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly discusses an example of an entrepreneur** who successfully leveraged opportunities (copite) to create wealth (jàngu bi) for themselves and others. The question asks *what* helps people take advantage of opportunities. The entrepreneur is the prime example given.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Am gis gis ci nit ñi sopi cosaanu kureel gi** (Having knowledge about the secrets of the world) - While knowledge is implied as beneficial, the passage doesn’t focus on *secrets* but on recognizing and acting on existing opportunities.
* **C: Gis doole yuy jiitël kureel gi** (Having good luck in the world) - Luck isn't emphasized; the passage stresses taking initiative and being resourceful.
* **D: Xam taariixu kureel gi** (Knowing the history of the world) - History is mentioned, but as context, not as the primary driver of opportunity.



Therefore, the entrepreneur's example best answers the question of what facilitates taking advantage of opportunities."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, am ap xamxamu taariixu kenn dina mën a dimbali ak lan?","The correct answer is **A: Wàññi ragalu copite** (The desire for capital/profit).

Here's why:

The passage repeatedly emphasizes the drive for wealth (""coppite"") as a core motivation for people's actions, both historically and currently. It discusses how people are willing to go to great lengths – even exploiting others – to acquire capital.  The passage contrasts this with a lack of understanding of history and the consequences of these actions within families and communities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dooleel njariñ yi (The challenges of work)** - While work is *related* to acquiring capital, the passage focuses on the *desire* for it, not the difficulties of labor itself.
* **C: Yeg ni am nga palaas ci biir kureel gi (Having a place in the global market)** - The passage doesn't primarily discuss global market positioning. It’s about individual and family motivations.
* **D: Yeesal jëfi entreprenër (The success of entrepreneurs)** -  The entrepreneur example is *an illustration* of the pursuit of capital, not the main theme. The passage also hints at the negative consequences of unchecked entrepreneurial ambition.



Therefore, **A** best encapsulates the central idea of the passage: the persistent and often problematic drive for wealth."
Ban ci baat yii ñooy wone nu ñuy jegee njàng mi ci jàmono bu jiitu diirub téy?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeen jaar jaar ci njàng ñoo gëna am njariñ yeneen yi** (Many things happen in life that allow us to learn from others).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on learning from experiences and observing others.** It discusses how we gain knowledge through media (television) and by watching the successes and failures of those around us. The phrase ""njang mi ci jaar-jaar bu nekk ci digante jangkat bi ak xam-xam lañ koy wonee"" directly translates to something like ""life is full of experiences that allow us to learn and grow.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Njàng dafa wara jublu ci ay mbir yu ñu gëm ni dina ñu leen dundi** (Life is happy in things that people like and find useful) - While the passage suggests finding meaning, it doesn't solely focus on happiness or personal preference.
* **C: Yenn faanu jàng yu gën yeneen yi** (Some lives are better than others) - The passage doesn't make a judgment about the quality of different lives. It focuses on learning from *all* lives.
* **D: Ci njàng amul ap dëgg bu nekk ba fàww** (In life, some things are easily achieved) - The passage doesn't suggest anything is easy. It implies that understanding comes through observation and experience, which can be complex.



"
Ban ci baat yii toop moo dul wone ap jege njàng bu jiitu diirub téy?,"The correct answer is **C: Ap jaar jaar ci njàng sukkëndiku na ci kuy jàng ak xam-xam gi ñu wone.**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses how people are increasingly influenced by what they see on television (xam-xam gi ñu wone).**  It highlights how this influences their understanding of freedom (liberté) and their choices.
* **It specifically points out that people are often guided by the images and information they receive (kuy jàng ak xam-xam gi ñu wone),**  rather than independent thought or experience.
* **""Sukkëndiku na"" means ""are leaning towards"" or ""are inclining to,""** accurately reflecting the passage's central idea of people being directed by external sources of information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Am na ay yoon yu bare ngir jàng xebaar:** While there are ways to spread information, the passage focuses on *how* information is received and impacts people, not just the methods of spreading it.
* **B: Yeen jaar jaar ci njàng dañu leen wara gënëleeg ak yeneen yi:** This talks about comparing oneself to others, which isn't the core theme of the passage.
* **D: Xam-xam bu ñu mëna mësa baña jëfee am na njariñ ngir ñu jàng ko ba tey:** This focuses on false consciousness and needing to overcome it, which is *a consequence* discussed in the passage, but not the primary topic of *why* people are easily influenced.

"Ba ngeen yeewoo ci ni ngeen ko bëggee ci waxtu nelaw, ban ci yii mooy mëna xew ndax nelaw gu ngeen dagg?","The correct answer is **C: Fay alarm bi ci sa wet te deluwaat nelaw ñaar fukki simili yi ci toop.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a struggle to wake up and get out of bed.** It mentions needing an alarm, feeling tired, and wanting to go back to sleep.  It specifically mentions wanting to sleep for ""10-60 similii"" (minutes).
* **Option C directly addresses this:** ""Fay alarm bi ci sa wet te deluwaat nelaw ñaar fukki simili yi ci toop"" translates to ""Turn off the alarm and sleep another few minutes."" This aligns perfectly with the described behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jàng benn waxtu ak xaaj balaa ngay nelawaat** - ""Just a moment and I will sleep"" - This is too passive and doesn't address the alarm or the desire for a *specific* amount of extra sleep.
* **B: Jëfëndikoo wanag yi te gaaw deluwaat tëddi** - ""Thank God and get up immediately"" - This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
* **D: Yeewu ngir naan ndox ci buteel mi nekk ci sa wet** - ""Drink water from the bottle on my bedside table"" - While the passage *mentions* fluids, it doesn't link drinking water to the act of trying to wake up.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ap wone bu dëggu ci nelaw gu ñu dog?,"The correct answer is **C: Doxalin bi mungi xew ci diirub sa nelaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Dagg nelaw mooy doxalin boo xam ne yaay dagg sa nelaw..."" (The problem with sleep is drowsiness, if you feel drowsy during the day...). This establishes that *doxalin* (drowsiness) is a key issue related to sleep.  The passage then discusses factors that contribute to or worsen this drowsiness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mën na sukkëndiko ci yëngu yëngu yaramu nit:** This translates to ""We need to focus on the health of people."" While generally true, it doesn't address the specific problem discussed in the passage.
* **B: Jublukaay bi mooy baña yee sa bopp bu baax:** This translates to ""Breakfast is good for your health.""  Again, a general statement not relevant to the passage's core topic.
* **D: Boo leen yeewoo, jublukaay bi mooy deluwaat nelaw ci diirub ñaari waxtu:** This translates to ""If they want, breakfast can help improve sleep at certain times."" This is a possible idea, but not the *main* point of the passage. The passage focuses on *doxalin* (drowsiness) as the core issue.



Therefore, option C is the only one that directly reflects a central point made in the text."
"Ni yuur bi di jeemee di indi geent saa su nekk, lan moo yokku?","The correct answer is **D: Waxtu bu nekk ci diggënte état wu REM yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Li waral mbiir mii mooy njureefi gént di xoole yokk guddaayu waxtu bi ci digganté nekkinu REM yi.""  This translates to ""The main reason people dream is because they spend a lot of time transitioning into REM sleep.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yokkute wu état wu REM yi:** (Being in REM state) - The passage says the *transition* *to* REM is important, not simply *being* in REM.
* **B: Tolluwaayu kàttan:** (Little stories) - While dreams *are* stories, this isn't the reason given for dreaming in the passage.
* **C: Guddaayu etaawu jëlaat:** (Spending a lot of time imagining) - This is related to dreaming, but not the core reason presented in the text.



"
Ban ci éfe yu baaxul yii toop la géent yu ñu ràññee mëna am ci jëmu yaram gi?,"The correct answer is **A: Guddaayu waxtu gu wàññeeku ci diggënte état REM yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Li waral mbiir mii mooy njureefi gént di xoole yokk guddaayu waxtu bi ci digganté nekkinu REM yi.""  This translates to: ""The main reason for nightmares is to experience intense times while entering REM sleep.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: REM yu wàññeeku ci guddi:** The passage doesn't focus on *which* REM stages are intense, just the intensity *while entering* REM.
* **C: Di sukkëndiku ci ay géent yu leer:** The passage doesn't mention a connection to specific learned experiences.
* **D: Yokkute REMs ci guddi:** The passage doesn't focus on the *frequency* of REMs, but the intensity of experiences during entry.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, naka la ekip yu tegu ci yoon ak ekip virtuel yii nuroowee?","The correct answer is **B: Ñaari ekip yi yëpp am nañu tolluwaay yuy wuute ci mëna taxaw kepp ci seen jëfu bëss bu nekk.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tééwayu “kurel bugnu dul giss” bu deegu (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) bénn la ci kurel bugnu dul giss. Li ñuy woowe «ekip bi kenn dul gis» ekibu gestion la bu ku nekk di def benn rapoor. Ekip bi kenn dul gis mooy wax lu member bu nekk wara def.""  This translates to: ""The effective work group (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is based on the effective work group. They define the 'work group' as a management unit that is responsible for delivering a report. A work group is a collection of members who work independently.""

This clearly indicates that effective work groups (and therefore the difference between them and virtual teams) *lack* a shared purpose or close collaboration – they work independently and deliver individual contributions.  Option B reflects this lack of shared workspace and reliance on individual effort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  This implies shared location, contradicting the passage's emphasis on independent work.
* **C:** Reporting *to* a work group doesn't define the difference; it's about *how* the group functions.
* **D:**  Sharing time doesn't address the core difference – the lack of collaborative purpose.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci ekip ci jëm ak ekip virtuel moo dul dëgg?","The correct answer is **B: Ekip virtuel yi dañuy jëf yeenisaay ni luy jokalante ak ekip yi ci jëm.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses ""kurel bugnu dul giss"" (teams that work well) and contrasts them with the challenges of managing teams. It specifically mentions that virtual teams *need* to establish trust and communication to be effective, unlike teams that work face-to-face.  This aligns directly with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While teams *benefit* from collaboration, the passage doesn't state this is the primary difference between physical and virtual teams.
* **C:** Autonomy isn't presented as a defining characteristic differentiating the two types of teams.
* **D:** This option speaks to scheduling difficulties, which is a *result* of virtual teams, not a fundamental difference in how they operate.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul lenn lu ay mbir yu ëmb teori di jublu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay bëgg bëgg yu bees yuy antu ci àtu magg**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses motivations (xaalaat) and needs (ñoo ngi jeem).** It specifically mentions Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory – both theories about *why* people are motivated.
* **Option A (""Ay bëgg bëgg yu bees yuy antu ci àtu magg"" - The things that push people towards certain goals) directly relates to motivations.**  It's about the driving forces behind behavior.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Naka la dëkkuwaayu ñeen mëna sopee seeniy jëfin (How people understand their own limits)** - While self-awareness is important, the passage isn't *about* understanding limits, it's about what *drives* people.
    * **C: Ay soxla yu ñu am ci biir (The responsibilities they have in life)** - Responsibilities can *influence* motivation, but aren't the core of the theories discussed.
    * **D: Jëli lu nit ñi bëgg (The value of people's desires)** -  This is too broad. The theories are about *categorizing* and *understanding* the motivations, not simply valuing them.



Therefore, option A best answers the question of what the theories in the passage aim to explain."
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ap jumtukaay ci yoonub ñeet ñi?,"The correct answer is **A: Defar ap dencukaay fu ñu mëna denc nit ki**.

Here's why:

* **P's text** describes a situation where someone is having trouble understanding a topic (likely related to schooling) and needs help. They state the issue is about ""nataal"" (schooling) and mention needing assistance with ""buy defar luy dëgëral di denc ay nattuwaay"" - meaning difficulties understanding lessons and needing help with homework.
* **Question Q** asks about what commonly causes difficulty in school.
* **Option A** (""Defar ap dencukaay fu ñu mëna denc nit ki"" - Difficulty understanding lessons because students don't understand the material) directly addresses the core problem described in P's text – struggling with understanding the lessons.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B:**  While issues with resources (""dund ak kàttan"") *can* affect schooling, it's not the primary difficulty described.
* **C:**  ""Denc nit ki ci ap bërëp bu leer te baax"" (Students' behavior in a good and respectful environment) doesn't relate to *difficulty* in school.  It describes a positive school environment.
* **D:** ""Samp yoon ci biir ap nataal"" (Lack of interest in schooling) is a *result* of difficulty potentially, but isn't the initial problem.



Therefore, **A** most accurately reflects the core issue presented in the initial text."
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone melokaanu nataal bu 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: Dafa am ap melo ratio bu wuute ak yeneeni tërëlin yu yomb**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Formaa 35mm nekk lu mëna jaxase xel ca dëgg-dëgg, 36mm ci yaatuwaay ak 24mm ci njoolaay. Rasiowu melokaayu format bii (mooy xaaj ko ci fukk ak ñaar ngir am nombre entier bi gëna yomb) loolu mooy nekk 3:2.""  This means the 35mm format *has* a specific aspect ratio (3:2) which relates to its dimensions.
* **The passage also states:** ""Ay melo yu bare (APS melo njaboot, ci misaal) dafa toloog wala joge lool me lo rasiyo bii."" This indicates that other formats (like APS) have *different* aspect ratios.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñungi koy defar ba tey:** (We cannot define it precisely) - The passage *does* define the aspect ratio as 3:2.
* **B: Tërëlinu kamera digital nangu na ko:** (Digital cameras have it) - While digital cameras *can* mimic the 35mm aspect ratio, that's not inherent to the 35mm format itself.
* **D: Dafa di tërëlin bu gëna siiw ci biir àddina bi:** (It's a common frame size in the world) - While 35mm is common, the question asks *what* it has, not how common it is.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ni defarkat yi di yokkee baaxaayu defaru lentiy yi, naka lañu yeesalaate lentiy zoom yi?","The correct answer is **A: Dañu am gaawaayu lentiy bu gëna kawe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Beneen mbir bu baxul ci zoom yi mooy ni ubité bu gëna mag (gaawaay bi) jumtukaay bi dafay faral di neew.""  This translates to ""One of the biggest problems with zooms is that the image (the lens) has to move to focus.""  This directly relates to having a ""gaawaayu lentiy bu gëna kawe"" - a moving lens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñoo gëna yomba jëfëndikoo ci bërëpu leer gu neew:** This discusses benefits of better focus for photographers, not a specific problem with zoom lenses.
* **C: Seniy baaxaayu nataal mel na ni ay lentiy yu am ap guddaay gu ñu yemale:**  This talks about the quality of images compared to other lenses, not a technical issue of zooms.
* **D: Dañu am ay jafe jafe yu neew wuuteeg lentiy yu njëkk:** This refers to differences between lenses in general, not the specific issue with zoom lenses needing to physically move to focus.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bi ci lu ñu bind, kañ la ap lentiy zoom di gën ap lentiy bu njëkk?","The correct answer is **A: Bu ap ubbeeku bu sës te yaatu nekkee lu jiitu**.

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **The passage discusses the benefits of zoom lenses:** It states they allow for flexibility in framing shots, letting you choose between wide and close-up perspectives (""focale yi du soppiku wala yëngu"").
* **It highlights the convenience:**  It contrasts needing multiple lenses (""defar lantiy yu baax"") with the single convenience of a zoom lens.
* **""Bu ap ubbeeku bu sës te yaatu nekkee lu jiitu"" translates to ""It is a convenience to be able to quickly and easily change perspectives.""** This directly aligns with the benefits described in the text – the ease of switching between focal lengths/perspectives offered by a zoom lens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Boo bëggee ay mbir yu neew ci lentiy bi (It allows you to use new settings on the lens):** While zoom lenses *can* have settings, the core benefit isn't about the settings themselves, but the framing ability.
* **C: Boo bëgguta jëfëndikoo ap flash ci bërëp yu lëndëm (It allows you to use flash in difficult conditions):**  The text doesn't mention flash at all.
* **D: Sooy gën di wër ay jafe jafe ci guddaay bi (It helps you take many shots in a row):** This refers to burst mode or continuous shooting, not the core function of a zoom lens.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) defines mysticism** as a deep, personal experience and connection to the divine (God, the spiritual world). It mentions seeking understanding beyond the rational, and a connection to the sacred.
* **Option D** best reflects this. It says mysticism is something people seek when they want to *mingle* (mingëleeg) with and understand the mysteries (yeneeni těrëlinu) of religion (ngëmu diine) and spirituality (màggal).  It acknowledges a deeper searching beyond surface understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  ""Am na ap maas ci di dund ap nekkinu jàmm ak barke ci xel mi"" - This is too vague and doesn't capture the *spiritual seeking* aspect of mysticism.
* **B:** ""Ñuy toop mistisism dañuy wër ap xam ci bopp bi luy di ap dëgg ci xel mi"" - This focuses on understanding the world, not necessarily the divine.
* **C:** ""Ñuy toop mistisism mën nañuy def ay jëf yu leen di dimbali ngir maggal seen gis gis ci dëggu yàlla yi"" -  This talks about fulfilling needs through faith, but doesn’t represent the core *experience* of mysticism.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ci lu Mistisism di jublu?","The correct answer is **A: Di wër yeg yeg ci dëgg yàlla yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) defines Mysticism (ngëm) as a close relationship with the divine, God, or the spiritual world.** It emphasizes a direct experience and understanding of God.
* **Option A (""Di wër yeg yeg ci dëgg yàlla yi"" - It is a strong belief in divine things) directly reflects this core definition.**  It speaks to a deep connection with and faith in the divine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di toop gis gis ci di ko jaaree ci seddoo jaar jaar yu ñu bokk dund (It is often found in strange and unusual practices)** - While mysticism *can* be expressed through rituals, the passage doesn't focus on the practices themselves, but the *experience* of the divine.
* **C: Ap maas ci ap xel gu barkeel (It is better than a simple understanding)** -  This is too vague and doesn't address the essence of mysticism.
* **D: Di toop di xalaat ci Yàlla saa su nekk (It is often a deviation from the existing God)** - The passage doesn't suggest mysticism is a rejection of God, but rather a deeper, more direct connection with God.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo tambali ap askanu mbay?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori bu Ile Chatham**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Moriori were settled on the Chatham Islands (""...Moriori yi ab kuréelu Maori yu bokk ci kontinan bi bu toxu woon bawoo Nouvelle Zeland dem ci Chatham Islands...""). The passage contrasts them with the Maori who settled New Zealand.  Therefore, the question asking where they are from is best answered by ""Moriori bu Ile Chatham"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriori bu Nouvelle-Zélande:** The passage says they *left* the mainland to go to Chatham Islands.
*   **C: Mbooloom Maori yu Polynésie:** While the passage mentions the Maori came from Polynesia, it's specifically asking about the Moriori's location.
*   **D: Maori yu gox bi ci boppam:** This is incorrect. The Moriori are a distinct group, not just Maori from the mainland.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, mbooloo mi rëboon moas ñoo nekkoon ñu njëkkoon a dëkk ci ban bërëp?","The correct answer is **C: Ilu Chatham yi** (The Chatham Islands).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Moriori yi ab kuréelu Maori yu bokk ci kontinan bi bu toxu woon bawoo Nouvelle Zeland dem ci Chatham Islands, nekk di defar seen cosaan buñu moomal seen bopp te teggu ci jàmm."" This directly translates to ""...the Moriori were driven by Maori who came from the continent to the east of New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, where they established their own culture and lived peacefully.""

Therefore, the Moriori established themselves on the Chatham Islands after being driven there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gox bi ci boppam:** (Something in the east) - Too vague and not specifically mentioned as the place they settled.
*   **B: Nouvelle-Zélande:** (New Zealand) - The Moriori were *driven from* New Zealand, not where they settled.
*   **D: Polynésie:** (Polynesia) - While the Maori came *from* Polynesia, the Moriori settled on the Chatham Islands.

Ci ban xew la di jëfëndikoo ay jumtukaayu origami Pureland di amee njariñ ngir booleeb denc bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Booleeb denc bi dafa bëgg di defar ay dencukaay yu bare benn yoon.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** John Smith was investigating these origami pieces in the 1970s to find out *if they were related to a specific case* (dimbali dosiyee yi aayul noonu wala ñi xawa ame laago). This implies the origami was being looked at for clues or connections to something else - essentially, to *uncover information*.
* **Option A (""Booleeb denc bi dafa bëgg di defar ay dencukaay yu bare benn yoon"" - ""The document is trying to reveal hidden information"")** directly aligns with this.  It suggests the origami is being analyzed to discover something not immediately obvious.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Booleeb denc bi dafa am ay mënin yu awaanse lool (""The document has many interesting meanings"")** - While possible, the passage focuses on *investigation* and *connection to a case*, not just interesting meanings.
* **C: Booleeb denc bi mooy defare origami yu soxla ay lem lem yu wëlbëtiku (""The document is about detailed origami with complex shapes"")** - This describes the origami itself, not the *purpose* of its investigation.
* **D: Booleeb denc bi jeem na ko benn yoon kesse walla ñaari yoon lu jiitu (""The document does not concern a single or multiple people"")** - The passage implies the origami is related to *someone* or *something* (the case), so this is incorrect.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone bu baax origami Pureland?,"The correct answer is **A: Dañu ko jagleel booleeb denc yu ñu dund.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Pureland origami mooy origami ak deegeeru bénn lém dong lañu mayé, té lém yepp ni yi nu déñcee yi mayé wunu ko, té bu si nekk xam nañu fumu né.""  This translates to: ""Pureland origami is origami and deer skin that many people make, and those who make them are skillful, and it is said that it has a long history.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is particularly good about Pureland origami?""
* **Option A (""Dañu ko jagleel booleeb denc yu ñu dund"")** translates to: ""It is known for the skill of those who make it."" This directly reflects the passage's statement about the craftsmanship involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Doesn't relate to the passage's focus on skill and history.
* **C:** Mentions materials (""ay bërëp yu yomb"") not specifically highlighted as a strength in the passage.
* **D:** Mentions being good for ""booleeb denc"" and ""ay mënin,"" which aren't discussed in the passage.  It also speaks of ""a long history"" which isn't the *primary* characteristic described.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban bërëp moom la ñu boolewul ak Civilisation wu Vallée bu Indus?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bobu am ñukoy wowe Aada Harappan gannaaw Harappa, barap bu jitu buñu gas ci atum 1920s.""  This directly translates to ""...and it is named the Harappan civilization after Harappa, a very important site discovered in the 1920s.""  Therefore, Harappa is closely linked to the discovery and naming of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dexub Sarasvati:** The Sarasvati River is *associated* with the civilization, but Harappa was the first site discovered and gave the civilization its name.
* **C: Resonwu bët-gànnaaru penku Afghanistan yi yëpp:**  While the civilization extended into Afghanistan, it wasn't the defining discovery point.
* **D: Lu ëpp ci Pakistanwu bësi tey:** This is a geographical area where the civilization existed, but doesn't represent the defining discovery.



"
Ban ci tur ñuy lim moo bokkul ci Civilization Jamono Përëm bi ñu waxtaane ci bind mii?,"The correct answer is **B: Civilisasion Indus-Sarasvati**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Doonte amna ay ndongo daara di wax ni ba aada ame tamit ci ngéej bataay wowalna dexu Sarasvati, mën nañuko wowe ci lu yomb Aada Indus-Sarasvati..."" This translates to ""Some scholars argue that its center was located in the region of the Sarasvati River, and it is often referred to as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization...""  The text then connects this to the Harappan civilization (named after Harappa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Civilisasion Harappéenne bi:** While the Harappan civilization *is* part of the Indus Valley Civilization, the question asks for the broader name used when considering the Sarasvati River as a central location.
*   **C: Civilisasion Dexub Indus:** This is too narrow and doesn't encompass the wider geographical area.
*   **D: Civilisasion Vallée wu Indus:** ""Vallée wu Indus"" (Indus Valley Civilization) is a general term, but the text highlights ""Indus-Sarasvati"" as a more specific and scholarly designation related to the discussion in the passage.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy indi ap njariñ buy yàgg?","The correct answer is **A: Liggéey ak ñeneen ñi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of relationships and getting along with others.** It states that good conduct and positive relationships are a good nature and a positive trait. The phrase ""liggéey ak ñeneen"" (getting along with people) directly reflects this central theme.
* **The question (Q) asks about what is most important in life.**  The passage clearly positions relationships as paramount.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jiitël sa njariñu bopp:** While earning a living is important, the passage doesn't focus on wealth or work.
* **C: Maas lan mooy jariñi ñu gëna neew ci kaw ñu gëna bare:** This is too complex and doesn't align with the passage's straightforward message.
* **D: Ràññee ni bëggé mën na jariñ:**  This translates to ""to hope to earn,"" which isn't the central point of the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the content of the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la kenn mëna jiitël su seen jublukaay nekkee ci jariñu bu gaaw?","The correct answer is **C: Bokk ci ap liggéey ak ñëpp**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of helping others and being generous.** It states that giving is a natural inclination and brings blessings (""Alhamdulilah""). It also highlights the value of relationships and supporting one another.
* **The question (Q) asks about the result of good deeds and a positive reputation.**  It asks what comes from being known for generosity and kindness.
* **""Bokk ci ap liggéey ak ñëpp"" translates to ""Benefit from helping others and relationships.""** This directly aligns with the message of the passage - good deeds (helping others) lead to positive outcomes (benefits and strong relationships).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Di fonk ñeneen ñi (""They are the function of people"")** - This is vague and doesn't connect to the idea of receiving benefits from good deeds.
* **B: Liggéeyandoo (""Giving"")** - While giving is mentioned, the question asks about the *result* of giving, not the act itself.
* **D: Siis (""Secrets"")** - This is completely unrelated to the passage's theme.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the text provided."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo muur ap waal bu am solo ci depensuu xare gi?","The correct answer is **B: Banku yu Wall Street** (Wall Street banks).

Here's why:

The text states the profits from the exploitation in the Philippines were ""deposited in the banks of Wall Street."" This directly links Wall Street banks to benefiting from the imperialistic endeavors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nguurup Philippine** (Philippine territory) - While the Philippines was the location of exploitation, it didn't *benefit* from it.
*   **C: Regim kolonialu U.S** (U.S. colonial regime) - This was the *instrument* of imperialism, not the direct recipient of the profits.
*   **D: Mbooloom Philippin** (Filipino people) - The text explicitly says they *suffered* from imperialism, not benefited.



"
Ban diir moo jiitu jàmonowu Templier yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Diggu àt yu jiitu**.

Here's why:

The text states the Templars were founded in the 12th and 13th centuries (1100-1300 AD). ""Diggu àt yu jiitu"" translates to ""Several states/countries"" which aligns with the idea that the order arose within a specific historical period encompassing multiple nations and regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Njeexteeb Diggu àt ya:** This translates to ""No states at all,"" which is false.
*   **B: Xarnu 12 bi:** This translates to ""The 12th century,"" which is *part* of the timeframe but not the full answer.
*   **D: Xarnu 13 bi:** This translates to ""The 13th century,"" which is also *part* of the timeframe but not the full answer.



"
Ban jàmono moo ñëw apare àtub Templier yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ati Moyen Ages yu Kawe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngir nànd Templier yi, dafay laaj ñuy li waral ñu sos ordre boobu. At mi nga xamantane xew-xew yi amoon lañuy jappee niki Ati Moyen Ages yu Kawe jamonoy Istuwaaru Orop ci 11eel, 12eel ak 13eelu siyeekal (Ginaaw JC 1000–1300).""  This directly translates to ""Regarding the Templars, they were among those who established their order. And we find traces of them particularly during the Early Middle Ages of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).""

Therefore, the Templars appeared during the Early Middle Ages.



"
Ban faj walla yoon mooy bu ñu limul ni bu doktoor yi di jëfëndikoo ak chirurgien yi ci jàmono ampiiru Romain?,"The correct answer is **A: Di faj estres buy laal bopp bi ak ay doom yu wuute.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci nguuru Auguste lañu tàmbali di jël docteur yi ngir ñu liggéey di fayeeku, ci la corps médical njëkkee am ci rome ginaaw su xare yi jeexee.""  This translates to ""Under Augustus, he established schools for doctors to learn how to treat, and a medical corps was established in Rome with excellent resources.""  This directly supports the idea that Roman emperors supported doctors and medicine.
* **The passage also mentions:**  The use of poppy and henbane for pain relief, and surgical practices, indicating a level of medical sophistication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di jëfëndikoo ay peepu ñax ngir scopolamine** (They defended people needing scopolamine) - While scopolamine is mentioned, the passage doesn't say they *defended* people needing it, only that it was used.
* **C: Teye ni deret bi di walaangaanee ak ay pins arteriel** (It is true that circulation was understood with arterial punctures) - The passage doesn’t discuss understanding of circulation or arterial punctures.
* **D: Dagg cër yi nëb ci ñi feebar** (Treatments were focused on the feverish) - While treatments for fever are implied, the passage doesn't state this as a *focus* of their medical practices.



"
Buñu sukkandikoo ci mbin mii ban ci mbir yii moo bokkul ci jéego yu mag yiñ amal ci wàllum paj ci Empire bu Rome?,"The correct answer is **A: Tàggatum corps médical** (The development of the medical corps).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ci la corps médical njëkkee am ci rome ginaaw su xare yi jeexee."" (The medical corps was highly developed in Rome, with excellent resources.)  It then details the sophisticated surgical practices and use of medicines.  The passage focuses on the advancements *within* the medical corps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yoonu xarekat yu meti yu Nguur gi** (The financing of the Emperor's projects) - While the Emperor (Auguste) is mentioned, the focus isn't on *how* projects were funded.
* **C: Taagatu njàngup bërëpu fajukaay yi** (The creation of public welfare systems) - The passage doesn't discuss broader welfare systems, only medical care.
* **D: Ni njiitu Nguur gi di tànnee doktoor yi** (The Emperor's initiative to train doctors) - While Auguste *used* doctors, the passage is about the existing, already advanced state of the medical corps, not a new training program.



"
Lan mooy mën mënu gis yaakaar ci?,"The correct answer is **A: Jëmmu yeg yegu gët yi** (They are looking for living things).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes someone looking for organisms – living things.** They mention ""organs tax ba nga yëgg ni"" (living organs) and talk about searching for animals (""tabaxi"") and observing their behavior.  They are actively seeking *what is alive*.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **B: Soxlawu ap organism:** ""Soxlawu"" isn't a term used in the context of seeking organisms, it's just stating what an organism is.
    * **C: Ap yeg yeg ci yenn guddaayu onde yi:**  This translates to ""They are looking at the behavior of the animals,"" but the passage is about *finding* them, not just observing them.
    * **D: Ay dëgare metit yu wuute:** This refers to ""old, dead tools."" The passage clearly focuses on living things, not dead objects.

Therefore, the overarching goal described in the passage is to find living things, making **A** the most accurate answer.



"
Ci lan la definu copite bët sukkëndiku ci diggënte ay organism?,"The correct answer is **D: Wuuteeb organism bi** (Microscopic organisms).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses tiny creatures (""gis-gis,"" ""tabaxi bët"") that are difficult to see.** It mentions they are so small they can be found everywhere and cause illness. This directly points to microscopic organisms like bacteria, viruses, etc.
* **""Wuuteeb"" means microscopic in Wolof.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeg yegu guddaayu onde yi (Large, visible waves):** This is unrelated to the discussion of small, unseen creatures.
* **B: Ay soxlawu organism bi (Complex organisms):**  The passage describes *simple* organisms, not complex ones.
* **C: Faanu metit (Small animals):** While ""faanu metit"" means small animals, the passage emphasizes their extreme smallness—beyond what is typically considered a small animal, and their ability to cause illness, which aligns with microbes.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci Sikhisme moo dul wone bu baax diine bi?","The correct answer is **D: Yenn ci ay cosaanu Sikhisme sampu nañu ci Hindouisme**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sikh yi jàppee nañu seen ngëm ni jeneen diine ju bokkul ak hindouisme waaye nangu nañu ni seen diine jooju mingi juddoo cosaanu hindoue yi."" This directly translates to: ""Sikhs consider it a religion close to Hinduism but maintain that it is a distinct religion with many different concepts from Hindu ones.""  This means some aspects of Sikhism *originate* from Hinduism, but it's not identical.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While Sikhism did arise within the Indian context, saying it's merely a sect of Hinduism isn't accurate according to the passage - it's a distinct religion.
* **B:** While the Guru is central to Sikhism, the passage doesn't state the Guru *created* Sikhism, but rather *guide* the religion.  Guru Nanak *founded* it.
* **C:** Guru Nanak was the *first* Guru, not the last.  The passage mentions nine other Gurus following him.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu jappee ap faan gu rëy bu yoonu ngëmu Sikh?","The correct answer is **A: Konseptu guru** (The concept of the Guru).

**Here's why:**

The text explicitly states: ""Guru mooy anam bu gën fés ci diine Indo yi wante ci diine Sikh jël na ab solo bu nekk ndëgëlay gëm gëm sikh."" (The Guru is a unique concept in Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it is the central pillar of the Sikh faith).  It also defines ""Gurmat"" as Punjabi for ""the wisdom of the Guru"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cosaani Indu (Hindu customs):** While Sikhism originated in a Hindu context, the passage emphasizes its distinctness and rejection of certain Hindu practices.
* **C: Baña nangu yeneen diine Indien yi (Similar to other Indian religions):** The text states Sikhs *believe* it's different from Hinduism, despite some similarities.
* **D: Di làkk ci kàllaama Punjabi (A feature of the Punjabi language):** While the religion is linked to the Punjabi region and language, the core identifying factor is the Guru concept.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ci lan la gone yu am ay jafe jafe ndax ñàkk topatoo mëna am ay metitu jublukaay?","The correct answer is **C: Di seetaan ay dessin animé** (They watch cartoons).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xalé yi am ADD dundu nagnu lu méti ci di nékk ci mbiri daara yi dongg, waye meennagno nék ci mbir yinu beegg def ni ay foo wala séétan ay cartoons...""  This translates to: ""Children with ADD often have difficulty concentrating in traditional schools, but they can often concentrate if they are allowed to watch television or watch cartoons...""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions cartoons as something children with ADD *do* focus on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Liggéeyu ékol** (They go to school) - The text actually says they *have difficulty* in traditional schools.
*   **B: Di suwé ay po** (They play games) - While possible, it's not explicitly mentioned as a focus of attention like cartoons are.
*   **D: Mbir yu ñuy begg di def** (Things they like to do) - Too general; the question asks specifically *what* they bind/focus on.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu tax gone yu am ay jafe jafe ndax ñàkk topatoo di tàmm di def ay jëf yu leen mëna gaañ?","The correct answer is **C: Def ba seeniy waajuur topatoo leen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children with ADD often have difficulty focusing and are easily distracted by things like cartoons or engaging stories (""ay foo wala séétan ay cartoons wala bind ay baat yu jub""). This distraction prevents them from fully engaging with their surroundings and completing tasks.  The passage further explains they struggle with ""dugg ci doxalin yu wóoradi, di xeex, te di dëkku kilifteef"" – struggling with attention, thought, and remembering things.  Therefore, a key issue is their inability to *focus on what's important* or *what's in front of them*.  ""Def ba seeniy waajuur topatoo leen"" directly addresses this – helping them focus on what they *should* be paying attention to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngir wàññi seen yëngu yëngu yu bare yi** (To satisfy their basic needs) - While basic needs are important, the passage focuses on cognitive difficulties.
*   **B: Ngir dimbali leen ñu jokkoo ak seeniy maas** (To help them socialize with their peers) - Social interaction isn't the primary issue discussed.
*   **D: Ngir yëngël seeniy yuur** (To ease their pain) - While there might be frustration, the core problem isn’t simply ""pain."" It's a neurological syndrome affecting attention.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bi ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii moo nekkul ap misaalu pasërel?","The correct answer is **A: Ap tektal bu ñuy tambali balaa ap sëwub ordinatër** (They are learning to use computers and software).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes someone learning computer skills.** It talks about needing to learn programs (even basic ones like Microsoft Office), using virtual scaffolding to help, and generally gaining familiarity with computers.  The passage focuses on developing *basic* computer literacy.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ap njàngalekatu SAT:** The SAT is a standardized test, unrelated to the passage's focus on basic computer skills.
    * **C: Ap tërëlinu njàng bu nga tànn:** This means ""They are continuing their studies,"" which is too broad. While learning *is* happening, the passage specifically focuses on *what* they are learning - computers.
    * **D: Ap taagatkatu lig bu ndaw:** This means ""They are learning the law,"" which is entirely unrelated.

Therefore, option A best summarizes the main idea of the passage – someone is learning to use computers and software.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone bu baax gis gisu pasërel?,"The correct answer is **A: Pasërel mën nañu nekk virtuel**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Esafodaas bu wirtuel boole nañ ko ci losisel bi ngir mu laaj..."" (Virtual scaffolding is available on the software to help him/her...).  This directly relates to virtual assistance/scaffolding being used for learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap ndimbël la te du ap tërëlinu njàng:** While the passage mentions help, it doesn't focus on *asking* for help or needing to be guided.
* **C: Xam nañu ko itam ni porosé sukkëndiku ci njàng:** The passage doesn't mention a process of understanding something difficult.
* **D: Pasërel yi dañu leen di jëfëndikoo ngir maye ndimbël ci bu ñuy tambali ap jaar jaaru njàng:** This option is too complex and doesn't align with the passage's main point about available virtual support.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban jumtukaayu Myspace moo mëna jariñ ndongo yu am jafe jafe ak jàng?","The correct answer is **C: Benn adaress web**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Benn adres Web rek ngay joxe nga mëna yegg ci xët wii, moo tax xel daf koy yomba jàpp, dina itam yombal liggéey bi ndongo yi am jafe-jafe ak seen clavier wala yi am jafe-jafe xam ni ñu koy bindee.""

This translates to: ""Each web address can be easily found on the internet, it often leads to people, but also leads to links with people who have keyboards or those who are believed to be connected.""  This directly refers to web addresses being the point of connection with people (and potential issues with those connections).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moomu:** This word doesn't appear in the text and has no relevance.
*   **B: Ay blog:** While MySpace *had* blogs, the passage doesn't specifically connect issues with connection to blogs.
*   **D: 54 milyongu profil:** This is a statistic about the number of profiles, not *how* people connect or the risks associated with that connection.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo bokkulwoon ci tontub Krouchtchev ci xeexub liggéeykat yi?","The correct answer is **C: Yokk wàññite payoor yi** (To suppress dissent).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Krushchev used tanks to intervene in Poland, responding to protests and demands for a more independent communist system. He ultimately allowed Władysław Gomułka to remain in power, but Gomułka was a more conservative leader.  This clearly shows Krushchev's aim was to control the situation and prevent challenges to communist rule. Suppressing dissent (stopping people from expressing opposing views) is the core of that action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fal ap premier ministre bu bees:** (To install a favorable prime minister) - While Gomułka *stayed* in power, Krushchev didn't necessarily install him; he was already there. The intervention was about controlling the *type* of leader, not simply installing one.
* **B: Jëfëndikoo ay chaar ngir delusiwaatal yoon:** (To defend certain ideological positions) -  Ideology was a factor, but the immediate issue was the unrest and protests.
* **D: Ràññee yenn wareefu koom-koom:** (To create a common understanding) - The intervention was the opposite of creating common understanding; it was a forceful suppression of differing opinions.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkulwoon lu waral xeex bi ci Pologne?,"The correct answer is **A: Komunism**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the goal of the protests was to oppose Communism (""...bi liggéeykat yi nekkee di ñaxtu ci nakkum lekk yi ak seen payoor yuñu dagg, mujjee doon ñaxtu bu ñepp di def ngir xeex Kominism"").  The rest of the options are either consequences *of* the protests (Ñàkk lekk, Payoor yu ñu wàññi) or a person involved (Wladyslaw Gomulka).

Therefore, the protests were *against* Communism.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo sopiwul diggënte wu URSS ak USA?","The correct answer is **A: Cosaan yu wuute**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Alëmaañ ab noon bu ñepp bokkoon la ci Ñaareelu Xare b Wër Addiina, yóbbu ci jëflante ci diggante USSR ak Amerig."" This translates to ""Germany was a key player in the Cold War, caught in the conflict between the USSR and America.""
* **""Cosaan yu wuute""** translates to ""Cold War issues"" or ""things related to the Cold War.""  This directly addresses the core topic of the passage - the conflict between the USSR and USA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xalaat yi jëm ci Almaañ (Problems occurring in Germany):** While Germany *was* affected, the passage focuses on its *role* in the larger conflict, not just the problems within Germany.
* **C: Ay tërëlin yu wuute (Certain important places):** The passage mentions places like Afghanistan and Cuba, but it's not about the places themselves, but the *proxy wars* fought there as a result of the Cold War.
* **D: Xuloo jëm ci kureel yi (Problems occurring in borders):**  Borders are mentioned as locations of conflict, but the question asks what the *conflict itself* was about.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone jublukaayu di yondee ay yëngëtuy sidit ci biir yaram gi yëpp?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeexël ni deret bi di doxee** (Yes, the environment is stable).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is about homeostasis.** Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions.  The passage describes how organisms work to *keep* things stable (""yuur gi dafay teye homeostasis..."").
* **The question (Q) asks about factors that help organisms maintain stability in their environment.**
* **Option A directly addresses this.** A stable environment is *essential* for an organism to maintain homeostasis. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Saytu nu deret bi di doxee** (Sometimes the environment is stable) - Homeostasis needs *consistent* stability, not just occasional.
* **C: Teye dalu organism yii di dund** (Organisms have to move) - Movement is a response *to* environmental changes, not a direct factor in maintaining stability.
* **D: Moytu xeex yu mëna jooli ci yaram gi** (Many different species live in the environment) - Biodiversity doesn't guarantee stability; it's the *stability itself* that's important for homeostasis.



"
Lan la ñu mëna gis ca Giza Plateau bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay baamel**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Giza Plateau bi, wala”Giza Necropolis” ci Wale nit ñu dee bu Egypt am na pyramid yu bare ( ci yooyu pyramid bu mag moo ci gëna gudd), **yeneen sëg yu ndaw yu bare**, ay jàngu, ak Sphinx gu mag gi.""

This translates to: ""The Giza Plateau, also known as the “Giza Necropolis” in ancient Egypt, contains large pyramids (including the Great Pyramid), **numerous tombs**, courtyards, and the Great Sphinx.""

Therefore, tombs (""baamel"" in Wolof) are found on the Giza Plateau.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ay tempal:** While temples are mentioned as being *built near* the pyramids for rituals, the plateau itself primarily contains tombs.
*   **C: Juroom ñaari kéemaan yi yëpp:** This translates to ""many different rooms,"" which isn't the main feature of the plateau.
*   **D: Piramid bu Màgg bi:** The Great Pyramid is *on* the plateau, but it's not what the plateau *contains* in general.



"
Lan moo nekkoon jublukaayu Piramid bu Màgg bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngir mu nekk benn ci juroom ñaari kéemaan yi ci biir àddina** (To be a prominent tomb among the most important in ancient times).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Pyramid bu Mag bi nekk na benn ci tabaxi pyramid yu gëna gudd nu defar ko ngir saragal Firawna bu genn addina."" This translates to ""The Great Pyramid was one of the most important pyramids ever built to bury the ancient pharaohs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Teral ap Firawna (A home for the Pharaoh):** While it was *associated* with the Pharaoh, its primary purpose wasn't to be a dwelling.
* **C: Ngir mu nekk ap mandarga (To be a place of gathering):** The pyramid was not a communal space.
* **D: Ngir denc baameelu nit ñu dee ñi (To help the ancient people):** While the construction involved many people, the pyramid's purpose wasn't directly to benefit them.



"
Kan moo yeloo suñu xam-xamu piromane bu yàkkoon tempal bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Taarixkat Greek bi Strabo waxna turbi ci kanam, mooy nan lañu xamé tay."" This translates to ""The Greek historian Strabo wrote about it, and it is through him that we know about it.""  This means Strabo is the source of the information about who burned the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waa Efes yi:** The Ephesians are the people *affected* by the burning, not the ones who reported it.
*   **B: Aleksandar bu Màgg bi:** Alexander the Great came much later and considered rebuilding the temple, but didn't report the initial burning.
*   **D: Artemis:** Artemis is the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not the arsonist or the reporter of the arson.



"
Ban mooy baat bu jub jëm ci tabaxaat kërup Artemis?,"The correct answer is **C: Herostratus lañu daanoon mu topatoo payub tabaxaat bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci 21 juillet 356 av JC lañu taal temple bu Artémis ca Ephèse, ki ñuy woowe Herostratus moo ko taal, di jëf yoon di ñaawlu."" This directly translates to: ""On July 21, 356 BC, the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was burned, which was done by Herostratus, seeking glory and fame.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says Alexander *found* the temple already burned, he didn't burn it.
* **B:**  Alexander offered to rebuild, but didn't actually do the rebuilding himself.
* **D:** The rebuilding didn't happen until 323 BC, not 320 BC, and the passage focuses on *who* burned it, not when it was rebuilt.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ mooy fan bu njëkk bu ap xeet doxee ci ñaari tànk?","The correct answer is **A: Juroom ñaari milyongu àt ca ganaaw** (Around 7 million years ago).

Here's why:

The text states ""Sahelanthropus meenna am mu dox ak ñaari tànk ci juroom ñaari miliyongi at ca gannaaw"" which translates to ""Sahelanthropus tchadensis is the oldest known hominin with a face similar to humans, dating back to around 7 million years ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñaari milyongu àt ca ganaaw** (2 million years ago) - The text specifies *around 7 million years ago*, not 2.
* **C: 3.9 milyongu àt ca ganaaw** (3.9 million years ago) - This refers to the *Australopithecus* timeframe, not the oldest known hominin.
* **D: 4.2 milyongu àt ca ganaaw** (4.2 million years ago) - Also related to *Australopithecus*, and not the oldest.



"
Ban ci yii xeet ñoo tàmm di dox si ñaari tànk?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahélanthrope**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...tay Sahelanthropus meenna am mu dox ak ñaari tànk ci juroom ñaari miliyongi at ca gannaaw."" ( ...Sahelanthropus is among the oldest with remains found dating back over 7 million years.)

The question asks which ones are among the oldest remains. The passage specifically identifies *Sahelanthropus* as being very old.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Homo erectus:** The passage mentions *Homo erectus* but states they are *later* (millions of years *after* the oldest remains).
* **C: Ay spesiyalisasiyon bipède:** While bipedalism is discussed, it's a *characteristic* not a specific group of remains.
* **D: Australopithèque:** The passage mentions *Australopithecus* but says they are *after* Sahelanthropus in terms of age.



"
Lan la marine Almande bi doon jeema antul ci jàmono Ñaareelu Xareb àdduna?,"The correct answer is **C: Di yoobu ay jumtukaay jaaree ko ci Atalantik bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wa Amerig dañu doon di jeema yóbbu ay nit ak ay jumtukaay jaaree ko ci Géeju Atlantik bi ngir jàppale waa Angalteer. Ci noonu itam, ci la waa marine bu Allemagne di jëfandikoo ay sous-marins ngir fexe dakkal trafic bii."" This directly translates to: ""And America was helping people and supplies across the Atlantic to help England. At the same time, the German navy was using submarines to cut off traffic.""
* This means the German navy (marine Almande) was actively working to disrupt the flow of supplies *across* the Atlantic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While they *targeted* England, the passage focuses on their actions *in* the Atlantic, disrupting shipping.
* **B:** The passage doesn't say they transported people and goods *to* England. They were *stopping* goods from reaching England.
* **D:** The passage states America was helping, not the German navy.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bu ñu joxe ci lu ñu bind, ku gënoon a am ndam ak xare géej gi ci jàmono kampaañu bët gànnaaru Atlantik bi?","The correct answer is **A: Angale yi ak Amerikin yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wa Amerig dañu doon di jeema yóbbu ay nit ak ay jumtukaay jaaree ko ci Géeju Atlantik bi ngir jàppale waa Angalteer."" (And America helped protect people and supplies moving across the Atlantic Ocean to help England.)
* **It also mentions:** The Allies (including England) were fighting against Germany.

Therefore, both England and America were involved in the battle for the Atlantic, protecting convoys and fighting against German submarines.



"
Lan moo amulwoon ba Assyrien yi sampee jëfëndikoo gawar?,"The correct answer is **C: Ay sareeti xare**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ndefarum pano cercle yi taxna ba saretu wa Assyri guena leer, guena gaw té guena baax ndax meun daq soldar yi ak yenen saret yi.""  This translates to ""...the shape of the shield was important to the Assyrians because it protected the soldiers and those who carried it.""  This directly connects the Assyrians to advanced shields/armor (sareeti xare - advanced equipment).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toogu bi (The language):** The passage discusses military technology, not language.
* **B: Ay fiit (The animals):** While cavalry (horses) are mentioned, they aren't the primary focus of what made the Assyrians special.
* **D: Gànnaay (The cities):**  The text doesn't focus on their cities, but their military capabilities.



"
Naka la xeex yuy jëfëndikoo ap gawar di xexee?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci kaw fas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...leegi nak jaabalkati Assyrie dañu dan xeex ci kaw ay fass yu amoul teg."" This translates to ""...even though the Assyrian armies were strong, they were defeated in cavalry battles.""  

Therefore, the text indicates that the weakness lay in **cavalry battles** ( *kaw fas*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: AK tank:** Tanks didn't exist in 1000 BC.
*   **B: Amul gànnaay:** While armies generally need supplies, the text doesn't mention supply issues as a weakness.
*   **D: Ak ay xarekat yu neew:**  The text specifically mentions *kaw fas* (cavalry) as the area of weakness, not new tactics.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan nga dul fekki ap situwayin wu Babylone bu yem?","The correct answer is **A: Di indi ay sarax ci ëtu ap tempal** (They offered sacrifices at the foot of the temple).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Nit ñi ñoo daan indi sarax yi ngir seeni boroom, pretre yi ñoo li wax li seeni boroom soxla ci ñoom ci biir ay xew-xew yu ñuy amal.""  This translates to ""Those who served offered sacrifices to their lord, the priests spoke what their lord commanded to them in the midst of many rituals.""  This clearly indicates sacrifices were made *at* the temples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fekkee ap xew ci ap tempal bu njëkk** (To celebrate news in the first temple) - The text doesn't mention celebrating news.
* **C: Ci ap festival ci ëtu ap tempal** (At a festival at the foot of the temple) - While rituals were performed, the text doesn't specifically describe a *festival*.
* **D: Di indi ay sarax ci biir ap bërëp bu sell** (To offer sacrifices in the middle of the bustling market) -  The text associates sacrifices with temples, not markets.



"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu doon jagleel bu baax sarxalkat yi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ziggourats**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yenn saay ay tabax yuñu def ni pyramide, ñu leen di woowee zigourats, dañ leen tabaxoon ngir ñu bokk ci temple yi.""  This directly translates to ""Some of their buildings they built like pyramids, they called them ziggourats, and they used them to climb to the temples.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Màggal yi (Priests):** While priests were important, the passage doesn't say they *built* structures. They received messages *through* structures.
* **B: Ay bërëp yu sell ci biir (People who sell in the market):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Ay xew (News):** The passage refers to ""xew-xew"" (news/stories) as being spoken by priests, but not as something being built.



"
Kañ la Buur Toutankhamon siiwee?,"The correct answer is **A: Toop saccub baameelam**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""Waaw! Buur bii di Toutankhamon, ñu daan ko faral di woowe """"King Tut"""" wala """"The Boy King"""", mooy buuru égypte antique bi ñu gëna xam ci jamono yu mujj yi.""  This translates to ""Wow! The tomb of Tutankhamon, they called him the young 'King Tut' or 'The Boy King', is the tomb of an ancient Egyptian that people know about in recent times.""

This clearly indicates that Toutankhamon is *famous* or *well-known* (toop saccub baameelam).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ci jàmono nguuram** (In ancient times) - While he *lived* in ancient times, the text focuses on his *current* fame.
*   **C: Ba ñu gisee baameelam** (Because they found him) - Finding his tomb contributed to his fame, but isn't the reason *why* he is famous.
*   **D: Ba ñu ko limee ci listub buur yu yàgg ya** (Because they put him on a list of important kings) - The text doesn’t mention being on a list.



"
Lan moo def Buur Toutankhamon ap buuru Egypte bu ñëpp xam bu baax?,"The correct answer is **C: Saccub ay junni artefacts yu jogee ci baameelam** (They found many valuable artifacts in his tomb).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Negam sëg yu bare yu yàgg sàcc nanu la fa nekk, sëg bi kenn laalu ko."" (Many valuable treasures were found in his tomb, treasures like none had ever seen before.)  This directly relates to finding valuable artifacts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba ñu gisee baameelam bu ñu laalul** (Because they saw his tomb when they found it) - While they *did* see the tomb, the passage focuses on *what* they found *inside* the tomb, not the act of seeing it.
* **B: Taxawaayam ci listu buur yu yàgg ya** (He is ranked among the greatest pharaohs) - The passage doesn't discuss his ranking or greatness, only his fame and the discovery of his tomb.
* **D: Njariñam ci jàmono Egypte yu yàgg ya** (He ruled over ancient Egyptian history) -  The passage states he *is* a part of ancient Egyptian history, but doesn't focus on his rule. It highlights the impact of *discovering* his tomb.



"
Lan la taalifkat Grec bi Homer mënutawoon a def?,"The correct answer is **B: Gis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...di taalifkat bu siiw bu bët yi muuru, mu bind mbir yu bari yu am solo ci littérature grecque: taalif yi tudd Iliade ak Odyssée.""  This translates to ""...the most important and famous authors, who wrote great works that are unique in Greek literature: the works including the Iliad and the Odyssey.""

Therefore, Homer wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey, making ""Gis"" (which means ""yes"" in Wolof and refers to Homer in this context) the correct answer to the question ""Lan la taalifkat Grec bi Homer mënutawoon a def?"" (""What did Homer write?"").



"
Ban Grec bu siiw la ñu xamee lenn lu dul littérature?,"The correct answer is **B: Homère**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""amaana ki ñu gëna xam mooy nitu culture bii ñuy woowe **Homère**, di taalifkat bu siiw bu bët yi muuru..."" (meaning: ""the most famous figure of their culture is **Homer**, the author of the most important works...""). It then goes on to mention his *Iliade* and *Odyssée*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sophocle** - The passage mentions Sophocles as a playwright, but doesn't present him as the most famous literary figure.
*   **C: Pythagoras** - Pythagoras is described as a mathematician, not a literary figure.
*   **D: Aristophane** - Aristophanes is also a playwright, like Sophocles, and not positioned as the primary literary icon.



"
Fan la njabootu Yawut yi doon nekk ci lu ëpp ci seeniy waxtu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci bend mi**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Li ëpp solo ci dundug njabootu hebreux yi ñu ngi ko amalee ci biti."" This translates to ""It happened in the time of the Hebrew people, they settled there bit by bit.""  and ""...butik yi ay komptuwaar yu ubbeeku ci mbedd mi la."" which translates to ""...shops have many counters in the city.""

Therefore, the Hebrew people settled *in the city* (Ci bend mi). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ci bërëp yu ubbeeku** (In many fields) - The passage doesn't mention fields.
*   **C: Ci ët mi** (In the sand) - The passage doesn't mention sand.
*   **D: Ci biir kër gi** (In the neighborhood) - While they settled *within* a city, the passage doesn't specifically say a neighborhood.



"
Lan moo nekkul woon lu am solo ngir njabootu Yawut yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Seeniy kër**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Kër amu fa noonu solo."" (Their house was only for them.) This directly implies the purpose of having a house was for the family/group themselves.
* **Q (the question) asks:**  What was it for the people of Yawut? (Yawut is likely a reference to the Hebrew people mentioned in the passage.)
* Therefore, the house was for *their home* – **Seeniy kër** (their home).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seen jawwu ji:** (Their word is true) - The passage doesn't discuss truth or words.
* **B: Seeniy dencukaay:** (Their wealth) - The passage talks about homes, not wealth.
* **D: Seen lekk:** (Their work) -  The passage doesn't focus on work.



"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu limul ni lu wuute lu nekk ci diggënte réewu Scandinave yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Taariix bi** (History).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the history of Greenland is linked to Scandinavian history (""dundu mbaay moy mbaay bu jugge ci porodiksiyon lekk bu doy Donté rééw buné 'Scandinavian' lawoon""). It also mentions the connection to Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Ireland – all Scandinavian countries with rich histories.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Suuf si** (Language): While language is important to culture, the passage doesn't focus on language as the defining link.
*   **C: Aada yi** (Customs): Customs are mentioned but are presented as *part* of the broader historical connection.
*   **D: Nit ñi** (People): The people are part of the story, but it’s the *history* that ties Greenland to Scandinavia, influencing the people, customs, etc.



"
Ñan ñoo njëkk sanc Groenlaand?,"The correct answer is **B: Ay Norvegien**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ca tariix scandinaves ñoo ngii waxni Erik le Rouge dañuko toxal ci Islaand ngir faat bàkkan, Bimuy tukki ci sowwu, ci la gis Groenlaand dal diko tudde Groenlaand."" This translates to: ""According to Scandinavian history, the first to settle in Iceland to find land, they came from the west, and that's how Greenland got its name, Greenland.""  It specifically mentions Erik the Red leading people from Iceland (Scandinavia) to Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay giiru Eskimo:** While the Inuit (Eskimo) are indigenous to Greenland, the text describes the *first* settlers as coming from Scandinavia.
*   **C: Erik mu Xonq:** Erik the Red was a leader *of* the settlers, not the entire population.
*   **D: Suédois:** The text broadly references Scandinavians (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Ireland), but specifically links the initial settlement to Erik the Red and those coming *from Iceland*.



"
Ban mbooloo mooy bëgg reer sang toogukaay?,"The correct answer is **C: Gooru Room yu am alal yi** (The rich people of Rome).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...boroom alal yi ñoom dañuy bëgg di toogandoo ci ay banquet, su ko defee ñu mën di lekk ak di waxtaanaale."" This translates to ""...the rich people used to love to organize banquets, where they would eat and enjoy themselves.""
* **The question asks:** ""Who loved to organize lavish feasts?""
* Therefore, the rich people of Rome are the ones described as loving to organize these feasts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jigéenu Room yu am alal yi** (The poor people of Rome who are rich) - This is a contradiction in terms.
* **B: Gooru Room yu miskin yi** (The poor people of Rome) - The passage focuses on the rich and their feasts, not the poor.
* **D: Jigéenu Room yu miskin yi** (The poor people of Rome) - Again, the passage highlights the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy, not the struggles of the poor.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul bokk ci ap feetu Roomain yu yàgg?,"The correct answer is **D: Ap palaatu koppin bu ñu saaf**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""benn magetu Rome mëssul ñam tamit koppin."" (Many Roman dishes used copper utensils.) This directly relates to the palate/taste (palaatu) and the use of copper (koppin).  The passage also mentions the elaborate feasts and desire for good food, implying a focus on enjoying the taste of the food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay miskin ñuñu woo yuy reer ci ay toogukaay:** (Poor people who lived in dwellings) - The passage focuses on the *food* of the wealthy Romans, not the living conditions of the poor.
* **B: aperitufu ngumbaan tooye bi:** (Expensive appetizers) - While the feasts were elaborate, the passage doesn't specifically highlight appetizers as a defining characteristic. It focuses on a wide variety of foods.
* **C: Ay boroom alal yi goor di tëdd ci waxtu reer:** (The wealthy who spent time leisurely) - This is true based on the passage (""boroom alal yi ñoom dañuy bëgg di toogandoo ci ay banquet""), but it's *about the people*, not what defined their cuisine.  The question asks about what *stood out* about Roman food.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy am ci lu ñu foogul ap liggéey buy sax?","The correct answer is **D: Ap cosaan civilisationnel**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses entirely on the concept of civilization (Siwikisasiyon).** It defines it, traces its origins (from Latin *civilis* and *civitas* meaning citizen and city-state), and discusses its development and impact on societies.
* **The question asks what the text is *about*.**  The entire passage is a discussion of civilization – its nature, history, and societal implications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ap mboolaay (About language):** While the passage *is written* in Wolof, its subject matter isn’t language itself.
* **B: Ap cosaan gu ndaw (About a small thing):** The passage deals with a vast and complex topic - civilization.
* **C: Ap dëkku réew (About state politics):**  While *civitas* (city-state) is mentioned as a root of the word civilization, the passage isn’t primarily about modern state politics. It's about the broader concept of societal development.



Therefore, **Ap cosaan civilisationnel (About a civilizational matter)** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, luy jiitu ap askan?","The correct answer is **A: Ap cosaan civilisationnel**.

Here's why:

The passage directly discusses ""siwikisasiyon"" (civilization) and its roots in Latin terms related to citizens and society. The question asks what the discussion *is* about.  Therefore, a ""civilization-related issue"" (cosaan civilisationnel) is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap cosaan bu wuute:**  While issues of importance are discussed, the core focus isn't just general importance, but specifically related to civilization.
* **C: Ap dëkku réew:**  (Issues of state/country) While civilization shapes nations, the passage isn't primarily *about* states themselves.
* **D: Ay cosaan yu ndaw:** (Some issues) This is too vague. The passage is focused on a *specific* kind of issue.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Wax nañu ni ci atum 1649, ci la Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel sos barab biñuy fattalikoo ndàm liñu am ci forsu Tibetan-Mongol.""  This translates to ""It was built in 1649 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel to commemorate the victory over Tibetan-Mongol forces.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mungi nekk ci Bhutan** (It is located in Bhutan) - While true, this is a general statement and doesn't explain *why* it was built.
* **C: Ap saafara moo yàq ndesitu foor yi** (The walls are very strong) - The passage doesn't mention the strength of the walls.
* **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel moo ko sàkk** (Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built it) - While true, this states *who* built it, not *why* it was built.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci atum 1951, ab daay dafa làkk lepp ba yenn desitu Drukgyal Dzong rekk nekk fa, lu melni nataalu Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyl.""  This translates to: ""In 1951, after a fire destroyed the Drukgyal Dzong, it was rebuilt in memory of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dooleb Tibetan-Mongol yi ñoo amoon ndam:** While the passage mentions Tibetan-Mongol forces were defeated there, it doesn't say *why* the Dzong was built or remembered.
* **C: Siiwaayu këccaate bi laalu ñu ko woon:** The passage doesn't mention anything about seeing things or events happening.
* **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel moo ko sàmmoon:** The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *ordered* the building, not that he was commemorated *by* it, though the rebuilding *was* in his memory.



"

* **The passage states:** ""Askanu Thaïs dugg nañu Cambodge yoon yu bari ci 18eelu xarnu ba ak ci atum 1772, ñoo yàq Phnom Phen. Ci at yu mujj ci 18eelu xarnu bi waa Vietnam yi tamit dug nañu ci Cambodia tamit."" This translates to: ""The Thais occupied large parts of Cambodia in the 18th century, including in 1772, they took Phnom Penh. Later in the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cambodge songoon na Thaïlande ci àtum 1772** - While the Thais *took* Phnom Penh in 1772, the passage doesn't say Cambodia *fought* Thailand.
* **C: Cambodge nag Vietnamien yi ñoo leen songoon ci ndoorteelu xarnu 18 bi** - The passage says the Vietnamese *invaded* (dug nañu) but doesn't specifically mention them being defeated.
* **D: Thaïlande yi yàqoon nañu Phnom Penh** - The passage states the Thais *took* (yàqoon nañu) Phnom Penh, but the question asks what happened *to* Cambodia, not what the Thais did.



"
Ban ci baat yii toop mooy wone ci bu baax songu Cambodge yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Vietnamien yi songoon nañu lu bare yoon Cambodge** (Vietnamese people occupied much of Cambodia).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci at yu mujj ci 18eelu xarnu bi waa Vietnam yi tamit dug nañu ci Cambodia tamit."" This directly translates to ""Towards the end of the 18th century, the Vietnamese repeatedly invaded Cambodia."" This implies occupation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Thaïlande yi ak Vietnamien yi songoon nañu Cambodge ci àtum 1772** (Thai and Vietnamese people occupied Cambodia in 1772) - While the passage mentions the Thais attacking in 1772 and taking Phnom Penh, it doesn't state they *occupied* the country. It focuses more on the continuous Vietnamese invasions.
* **C: Vietnamien yi yàqoon nañu Phnom Penh** (Vietnamese people attacked Phnom Penh) - This is a detail *within* the larger context of invasion/occupation, but not the main point about who controlled Cambodia.
* **D: Thaïlande yi songoon nañu Cambodge lu bare yoon** (Thai people occupied much of Cambodia) - The passage highlights the Vietnamese as the primary occupying force, not the Thais.

This directly translates to: ""In 1624, the Dutch East India Company landed on the island of Taiwan, beginning to establish fortresses and trade with the local populations and Chinese traders in order to control important resources and commodities.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Am ap bërëp ci faanu bëj-saalumu sowu bu dun bi** (It has no impact on the history of a short duration) - The Dutch presence *did* have a significant impact.
* **C: Jël ay liggéeykat chinois ci seeniy tool** (Trade with Chinese merchants in their tools) - While they traded with Chinese merchants, the primary aim wasn't just trade *of* tools, but control of resources.
* **D: Pare ci di wacc njiitu Taiwan ci loxoy nguuru Qing** (Prepared to give Taiwan to the Qing dynasty) - This is a later event. The text describes their initial actions, not a plan to surrender.



"
Lan la sartu diggënte bu Shimonoseki sampoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñàkku Japon ci xare Sino-Japonaise bu njëkk ma** (Japan won in the first Sino-Japanese war).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ci atum 1895, guinaw biñu ñàkkee xare bi amoon digante Sinuwaa yi ak Sapone yi (1894-1895), nguuru Qing bi xaatim na Sàrtu Shimonoseki..."" This translates to ""In 1895, following the war between China and Japan (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki...""  The treaty was a result of Japan winning the war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says Taiwan *became* part of Japanese territory *because of* the treaty, not that the treaty transferred Taiwan's administration.
* **C:** This is too vague and doesn't directly relate to the treaty.
* **D:** While Japan did control Taiwan, ""Sañ-sañu Japon ci kaw Taiwan"" (Japan benefited from the land of Taiwan) doesn't explain what the Treaty of Shimonoseki *did*.



"
Naka lañuy nattee tolluwaayu pH bu ap poroduwi simik?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñaata ci iyon idrogen ñoo nekk ci produit simik bi** (The amount of hydrogen ions present in the chemical product).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Li wane niveau pH mooy tolluwaayu ion hydrogène yi (H bi ci biir pH bi) ci produit chimique biñ saytu.""  (The pH level is the measure of hydrogen ions (H+ in the pH scale) in a chemical product.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci ban faan la poroduwi simik bi nekkee basik walla asid** (Whether the chemical product is basic or acidic) - While pH *indicates* acidity or basicity, it *is* the measurement of hydrogen ions, not simply categorizing the product.
* **B: Ñaata feppsaal ñoo nekk ci poroduwi simik bi** (The amount of substances present in the chemical product) -  This is too broad. pH focuses specifically on hydrogen ions.
* **D: Ñaata mbëjfepp ñoo nekk ci poroduwi simik bi** (The number of molecules present in the chemical product) - This is also too broad and doesn't relate directly to pH.



"
Lan la ñu dindeewoon ci iyon idrogen yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Feppsaal yi** (Acids).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ion yu ndox yi ay proton lañu yuñu dindiwoon seeni elektron..."" This translates to ""Acid ions are protons that have lost an electron...""
* Therefore, the passage directly links hydrogen ions (iyon idrogen) to acids (feppsaal).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ion concentration, not what hydrogen ions *are*.
* **C: Alkalin:** Alkalin (alkaline) is the opposite of acidic; it relates to a high pH and a *lack* of hydrogen ions.
* **D: Mbëjfepp yi:** (Bases) Bases accept protons, the opposite of what the passage describes about hydrogen ions.



"
Ban ci baat yii toop moo dul wone ci bu baax ap mbooloom gaynde?,"The correct answer is **A: Dañuy jëfee ni ay mbooloom xaj** (It seems that some values are bad).

Here's why, based on the provided text (in Wolof):

* **The text describes negative consequences of bad values.** It speaks of ""maag yu jigéen ak doom bu yaatu"" (bad morals and harmful behaviors) and the suffering they cause.  It contrasts these with good values (""bu baax ak séni njapp"" - goodness and respect).
* **The question asks what contributes to problems in society.** The text directly implies that *bad* values are a significant contributor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ratio goor ak jigéen yi toloowul** (The ratio of young people and elders is low) - This isn't discussed in the text.
* **C: Goor yi ak jigéen yi ñoom ñëpp a bokk jegeendoo** (Young people and elders don't want to listen to each other) - While there might be an implication of a disconnect, the text doesn't *focus* on this as the root problem.
* **D: Mën nañoo réye te mën nañoo dëkk ak nit itam** (We don't have peace and we don't have a good relationship with people) - This describes a *result* of the problem, not the cause that the text emphasizes.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the meaning of the Wolof text."
Ban ci baat yii toop moo dul wone ci bu baax nu gaynde yi di jëfee?,"The correct answer is **C: Goor yi ak jigéen yi ñoom ñaar ñëpp dañuy réy seeniy pàdd.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the beauty and value of different types of people – the pure (goor) and the gifted (jigéen).** It states they are valuable and contribute to the richness of society.  The passage highlights their positive qualities and how they interact with others.
* **The question (Q) asks what contributes to the good reputation of people.**  The passage directly links the good reputation to the presence and interaction of these ""goor"" and ""jigéen"" individuals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mën nañu dëkk ak nit lool** (We live with people) - Too general and doesn't address *why* people are well-regarded.
* **B: Seen jëfin mingoog naag yu bukki** (Their reputation is based on many bad things) - The passage is *positive* about these people, not negative.
* **D: Seen jëfin bu mingoog ak yeneen rabu aal yi** (Their reputation is based on many and different things) -  Again, too general. The passage specifically points to the ""goor"" and ""jigéen"" as key contributors to a good reputation.



"
Njomboor yi ban pàdd la ñu tàmm doon ngir ban xeetu rëbkat?,"The correct answer is **A: Muus yu ndaw yi** (Small animals).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ci njomboor ba ci kéwél ak beey... amoon na ay muus yu bari (bokk na ci muus yu pata) yuy lekk rëbb yu bari yi melni soccant yi, xeeti kaña yi, sindax yi ak picc yi.""  This translates to: ""Among the animals in the bush and the fields... we see small animals (sometimes including wild animals) which have big eyes, black fur, ears, and tails.""

The question asks what the animals are looking for. The passage implies they are looking for food (""rëbb yu bari yi melni soccant yi..."") which are things small animals would search for.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Muus yu màgg yi** (Big animals) - The passage specifically mentions *small* animals.
* **C: Ay muus yu yem** (Animals that eat) - This is too general; all animals eat. The question is about *what* they are specifically looking for.
* **D: Kewël yi** (Fields) -  Fields are the *location* of the animals, not the animals themselves.



"
Muus yu gëna ndaw yi dañuy tàmm rëb yan ci yii di toop?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaña yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...amoon na ay muus yu bari (bokk na ci muus yu pata) yuy lekk rëbb yu bari yi **melni soccant yi, xeeti kaña yi**...""  This translates to ""...we see many birds (some of them migratory) that have big nests, **with colorful feathers**...""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions *kaña* (feathers) as something the birds have. The question asks what the birds have a lot of, and *kaña* is the direct answer provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Njomboor yi** (animals) - The passage mentions animals generally but doesn't say the birds have a lot of them.
*   **C: Kewël yi** (places) - The passage mentions places (like the forest) but not as something the birds possess.
*   **D: Mbaam** (people) - The passage does not mention people.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo bokkul ci faanu rëbukaayu ap segg?,"The correct answer is **D: Di rëb dong ay mala yu ndaw ci jëm**.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes ocelots preying on small animals (mala yu ndàw yi - small animals).** The passage specifically mentions they ""top"" (catch) very beautiful rabbits and other small animals.
* **The question asks what ocelots do with beautiful animals.**
* **Option D (""They eat many small animals in the forest"") directly reflects this predatory behavior.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di nëbbëtu ci biir gàncax yi leen wër (They are interested in the smell of those who approach them):** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **B: Di toop xetu seen pàdd (They hunt for their skin):**  The text focuses on *eating* the animals, not using their skin.
* **C: Di toop seen pàdd ci diiru guddi gi (They hunt for their skin in the deep forest):** Same as B – skin isn't the focus.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone ci bu baax ap segg? ,"The correct answer is **D: Dañuy bëgg di rëb mala yu gëna ndaw yi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states directly:** ""Ocelots dañuy reebb ci jaxaso ak sén àll yi té song mala yi."" (Ocelots frequently hunt and eat monkeys and other animals that live in trees.) This directly supports the idea that they hunt and eat animals *in* the trees, which is what option D describes (""they hunt and eat animals that live in trees"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mën nañoo rëb bu baax bu guddi jotee:** (We often see good, large ones) - The passage doesn't focus on *seeing* ocelots, but on *what they do*.
* **B: Dañuy dox ndànk:** (They often sleep) - The passage doesn't mention ocelot sleeping habits.
* **C: Seen nooyikaayu xet dafa néew doole:** (Their young stay in the trees for a long time) - While the passage mentions trees, it doesn't discuss how long ocelot young stay in them.



"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu dul jappee ni kàttanu segg bu gëna rëy?,"The correct answer is **A: Yuuxu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yuxuk ségg bokkul yuxuk gayndé, wayé mélni baatu yuxu, ay baat yunu yuxu.""  This directly translates to ""The tiger eats a lot, the panther eats a lot, but the antelope eats little, every other animal eats little.""

The question asks what animals eat *a lot* (dul jappee - eat a lot). The passage clearly identifies *yuuxu* (antelope) as eating *little* and contrasts that with the tiger and panther (segg and Panteer) eating a lot.

Therefore, the answer is **Yuuxu** (although worded slightly awkwardly in the question, it’s the only option that aligns with the passage's description of plentiful eating).



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy lu wuute ci dëggënte segg yi ak gaynde yi?","The correct answer is **A: Mën mënu feey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a tiger (Segg) who is very strong and fearsome.** It says he's part of a powerful group (Xeetu Panteer) known for their strength, cunning, and courage.  It emphasizes his power and the fear he inspires.
* **The question (Q) asks what is *usually* the relationship between tigers and gazelles.**
* **""Mën mënu feey"" translates to ""They are usually enemies.""** This perfectly aligns with the natural predator-prey relationship between tigers and gazelles described (and implied) in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baatu seeniy yuuxu (""Their families are usually related"")** – The passage doesn’t indicate any familial connection.
* **C: Guddaay bu ñu mëna tëb (""Good because they meet often"")** –  The relationship is based on predation, not a friendly encounter.
* **D: Seen dooley këcc (""Their future is uncertain"")** – While the future of any individual animal is uncertain, the *relationship* is consistently predator/prey.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu wax, lan la Robert Hooke def balaa yeneen biologist yi?","The correct answer is **A: Seetlu selul yu dee yi** (He was the first to see cells).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Robert Hooke, di biologiste anglé, gisna carré yu ndaw yu defaree liege ci microscope."" (Robert Hooke, an English biologist, was the first to see small squares under the microscope).  This directly refers to his discovery of cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jëfëndikoo ap mikroskop ngir xool ap organism** (Invented the microscope to study organisms) - While Hooke *used* a microscope, he didn't invent it.
* **C: Xool ay kaarewal yu ndaw** (Studied small animals) - The passage specifically says he observed ""squares"" (cells), not animals.
* **D: Xam unité yu gëna ndaw yuy dox bu ap organism** (Discovered the basic units of life in an organism) - While his work *led* to the understanding of cells as basic units, the passage only states he *saw* them initially.  The concept of cells as fundamental units came later.



"
Lan la cosaanu baat bii di “selul” di firndeel?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay kaarewal yu ndaw** (Cells).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Robert Hooke, di biologiste anglé, gisna carré yu ndaw yu defaree liege ci microscope.""  This translates to ""Robert Hooke, the English biologist, saw small boxes under the microscope.""
* **The passage continues to say these boxes are the basis of all living things.**
* **""Carré"" means ""box"" or ""cell"" in this context.**  Hooke is credited with *naming* cells after observing them.

Therefore, the passage is describing the discovery of cells and how the term ""cell"" originated from observing these small, box-like structures.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay neeg yu ndaw** (People) - The passage doesn't focus on people, but on the building blocks of living things.
* **C: Ay tërëlin yu ndaw** (Animals) - While animals are made of cells, the passage isn’t about animals themselves.
* **D: Ay naaw yu ndaw** (Things) - Too general; the passage is specifically about a particular type of ""thing"" – cells."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu ëp ci mala yi am nañu mën mënu def lan?","The correct answer is **B: Yëngëtu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mala yu bari mën nañu yëngëtu."" This translates to ""These cloths have many colors.""  The question asks what is often found on the cloths.  ""Yëngëtu"" means colors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naaw:** Means ""no"" - doesn't relate to what's *on* the cloths.
* **C: Feey:** Means ""bright"" - describes a quality, not something *on* the cloths.
* **D: Gas:** Means ""gas"" - unrelated to the context.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la yenn mala yi amul?","The correct answer is **A: Selul yi**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Mala yi ay **selul yu bari** lañ leen defaree."" This translates to ""These malas (beads) are made of **cells**.""  The question (Q) asks what malas are made of. Therefore, ""cells"" (selul yi) is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mën mënu reesal:** This means ""many beautiful things"" - not what malas are *made* of.
* **C: Yuur yi:** This means ""the hands"" - while hands *use* malas, they aren't what malas are composed of.
* **D: Mën mënu lekk:** This means ""many beautiful lights"" - irrelevant to the composition of malas.



"
Lan mooy dimbali garab yi ci seen yoonub fotosintes?,"The correct answer is **C: Lekk**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Garab yi dañuy defar ay lekk ci naaj jaaree ko si photosynthèse."" This translates to ""Plants take in a lot of water during the process of photosynthesis.""
* **Q (the question) asks:** ""What is taken by plants during their photosynthesis process?""
* **""Lekk"" means ""water""** in Wolof.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taqandeer** - means ""air"" - While plants use air (CO2), the passage specifically mentions water intake *during* photosynthesis.
* **B: Ay mala** - means ""something bad"" - irrelevant to photosynthesis.
* **D: Naaj** - means ""sun"" - While sunlight is *needed* for photosynthesis, it isn't *taken in* by the plant in the same way water is.



"
Lan la nit ñi di génnee bu ñuy noyyi bu garab yi di noyyi?,"The correct answer is **B: Oxygène**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Garab yi ñooy défar oxygen bi nit yi di noyyi..."" (Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe...)
* **The question asks:** What do plants produce that humans breathe?

Therefore, the answer is oxygen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lekk** - Means ""air"" - too general.
* **C: Ndox** - While related to oxygen, it's not the direct answer to what plants *produce* for humans to breathe.
* **D: Gaas karbonik** - Means ""carbon dioxide"" - plants *use* carbon dioxide, they don't produce it for humans to breathe.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii misaal mooy teye ji yoonub yokkute bi?","The correct answer is **A: Ap mbooloo mu ndaw muy lajj ci di tekki ci ap bërëp bu bees.**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses speciation – the formation of new and distinct species in the course of evolution.** It explains how populations become isolated (like on mountains or islands) and diverge over time, eventually becoming different species.
* **Option A directly relates to this concept:** ""Ap mbooloo mu ndaw muy lajj ci di tekki ci ap bërëp bu bees"" translates to ""A population is isolated and develops differently from other populations."" This describes the *initial* step in speciation – isolation leading to divergence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap waalub benn askan miy dem ci ap diwaan bu bees:**  This suggests populations move into an area, which isn't the core process driving speciation as described in the passage.
* **C: Ap askan miy defar ap bokkam ci ap diwaan bu bees:** This talks about differences *after* a population is established, not the initial isolation.
* **D: Benn askan miy mujjee nekk ñaar:** This is a general statement about populations dying, not about the development of new species.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer because it captures the fundamental idea of isolation and divergence as the starting point for the formation of new species (speciation) as explained in the text."
Ban ci baat yii toop moo dul wone bu baax nu ñuy defaree ay xeet yu bees yuy dund? ,"The correct answer is **A: Dafay am bu ap askan bu bees mënulee bokk** (It happens through natural selection of beneficial traits).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly discusses natural selection.** It states that traits allowing better survival and reproduction (""askaan bu wuuteek liñu nekkoon bu njëkk"") become more common over time.  This is the core of natural selection.
* **The passage describes *speciation* (the formation of new species) as a result of this process.**  Traits accumulate over generations, leading to significant differences and eventually, new species.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nekk na ap mbir mu meti ci yoonub yokkute bi (It happens when a gene mutates in a specific environment):** While mutation *can* introduce new traits, the passage focuses on the *selection* of existing traits, not the initial mutation itself. Mutation is a *source* of variation, but selection is the *driver* of adaptation and speciation in this context.
* **C: Mungi wax ci ap defaru xeet bu bees (It speaks of developing beneficial traits):** This is too vague. The passage doesn't just talk about developing traits, but *how* they develop – through selection.
* **D: Feeñam mënu ñoo koo moytu (It is only due to random chance):** The passage emphasizes that traits that *improve survival and reproduction* are favored. This is not random; it's a directed process.



"
Ban waal ci doxalinu sistem bi mooy yoobu deret ci xol mi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sidit yi**.

Here's why:

* **P's text translates to (roughly):** ""To be alone is a beautiful thing, it's a comfort for the soul. Comfort comes from the soul, and the soul comes from the things people experience. Experiences allow one to learn and grow, and learning and growing come from the soul's experiences. Experiences generally require a lot of patience.""

* **Q asks:** ""What is found in the circulatory system related to the soul?""

* The text directly links ""comfort"" and the ""soul"" to ""experiences"" (""dérét""). And experiences are brought about by ""**sidit**"" (people).  Therefore, people (sidit) are the key component relating to the soul within the described system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sidit yu gëna sew (People who sew):**  Sewing isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Jëmm yi (Animals):** Animals are not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Vén yi (Bones):** Bones aren't relevant to the text's metaphorical discussion of the soul and experience.



"
Yan tub ñoo nekk yu gëna ndaw ci doxalinu sistem bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Sidit yi**.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a circulatory system.** It talks about blood (""xol bi""), arteries (""pompe deret ji""), and veins (""dérét day jaar jugé""). It also mentions capillaries (""kapileer"").
* **""Sidit yi"" translates to ""the arteries"".**  This fits perfectly with the description in P of how blood travels.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Sidit yu gëna sew** - ""Arteries that bleed"" - While arteries *can* bleed if damaged, this isn't a defining characteristic of them within the system described.
    * **C: Vén yi** - ""The veins"" - While veins *are* part of the system, the text specifically talks about arteries delivering blood.
    * **D: Jëmm yi** - ""The organs"" - Organs *receive* blood, they aren't the pathways themselves.

**Therefore, ""Sidit yi"" (the arteries) is the best answer, as the text is describing the circulatory system and specifically mentions the delivery of blood via arteries.**



"
Mën mënu ap gunoor ci di lem seeniy laaf ca ganaaw lan lay yokk ci yii toop?,"The correct answer is **B: Ay bërëpu nëbbukaay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Tay, gunóor yi mënul lém seeni laaf mooy lëppalëp ak xund xund yi."" (However, those who seek to achieve their goals are often associated with difficulties and hardships.)
* **The question (Q) asks:** What do people encounter when pursuing their goals?
* **""Ay bërëpu nëbbukaay"" (Difficulties and hardships)** directly answers this, aligning with the passage's statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indi lekk (Good luck):** The passage emphasizes *challenges*, not luck.
* **C: Di gis ay moroom (They find guides):** The passage doesn’t mention guidance.
* **D: Di naaw bu gaaw (They find peaceful things):** The passage focuses on struggles, not peacefulness.



"
Ban ci yii toop la ñu waxul ci biir lu ñu bind ni lenn lu mën mënu naaw bu ap gunoor laal?,"The correct answer is **A: Yokkute**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes people who are always complaining (naaw) and dissatisfied (mala).** They find fault with everything and are often envious of others' successes. This is a classic description of negativity and a pessimistic outlook.
* **""Yokkute"" (meaning 'envy' or 'jealousy')** directly relates to the core theme of the passage - people being unhappy with their own situation and focusing on what others have.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **B: Diirup dund (hard work):** The passage doesn't mention anything about work ethic.
    * **C: Dajale lekk (easy life):** The passage implies the opposite – these people are *not* content with their lives.
    * **D: Xarañ (charity):** Charity is not a theme within the text.

**Therefore, ""Yokkute"" best encapsulates the behavior and mindset described in the passage.**"
Ban ci yii melokaan la ñu dul booleel ak dinosoor?,"The correct answer is **A: Di doxee tànku ganaaw** (They find bones often).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Nit ñu bare yaakaaru ñu ne dinosoor lañu ndaxte dañoo am ay laaf te mën nañu naaw."" This translates to ""People find many things because dinosaurs left bones and teeth behind.""  The passage then continues to talk about finding bones (tànku).
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ay laaf (Teeth):** While teeth are mentioned, the passage focuses on *finding* bones more broadly.
    * **C: Di génnee nen (They are very old):**  The age of dinosaurs is implied, but not what people *find*.
    * **D: Ay tànk yu am ay wee yu ñaw (Tanks with new wheels):** This is a completely irrelevant detail introduced about T-Rex, and doesn't answer the question about what people find.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the passage is that people often find bones when studying dinosaurs.



"
Ban ci yii toop mooy bu ñu dul jappee ni ap melokaan bu nuroog bu ay picc ak ay dinosoor?,"The correct answer is **A: Di génnee ay nen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Nit ñu bare yaakaaru ñu ne dinosoor lañu ndaxte dañoo am ay laaf te mën nañu naaw."" This translates to: ""Some people believe that dinosaurs had feathers and might even have been warm-blooded.""  The passage then continues to describe discoveries of preserved skin and feathers.
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is a topic discussed in the text regarding pictures and dinosaurs?
* **Option A (""Di génnee ay nen"" - They had feathers) directly answers this.** The passage focuses on the evidence suggesting dinosaurs had feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di jëfëndikoo ñaari tànku ganaaw yi ngir mëna dox (They studied many different tanks to be able to roar)** - The passage mentions tanks, but not in the context of studying roars. It's referring to preserved skin/fossilized remains.
* **C: Mën mënu naaw (They didn't have blood)** - The passage suggests the *possibility* of warm-bloodedness, the opposite of this.
* **D: Ay tànk ak ay wee yu ñaw (Tanks and old colors)** - While ""tanks"" (preserved remains) are mentioned, the focus isn't on ""old colors.""



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban faan ci ap garabu cycas benn Triceratops di mëna lekk?","The correct answer is **B: Garab gi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yenn scientifique dañu jàpp ni Triceratops ay cycadale lañu daan lekk, muy ay xeeti xarab yu bokk ak Crétacé. **Garab yii dañuy nuru ak ay garabu koko wala tiir**...""  This translates to: ""Scientists have learned that Triceratops ate plants, mostly herbaceous plants from the Cretaceous period. **These animals were nourished by plants, either tall or short**...""

The question asks what Triceratops ate. The passage explicitly states they ate *garab* (plants).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xob yi di jamaate** (The plants were gathered) - While they ate plants, the passage doesn't focus on *how* they got the plants, just *what* they ate.
*   **C: Reen yi** (The reeds) - The passage mentions reeds as something they lived *near*, not as food.
*   **D: Doom ji** (The animals) - The passage states Triceratops were herbivores and ate plants, not other animals.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ap Triceratops di mëna lekk ci bu woor? ","The correct answer is **A: Mala bu taayal bi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Benn Triceratops meenna jeefee ndiko koppam bu mak ngir genné xob yi laata lékk gnam bi."" This translates to: ""Triceratops mainly ate plants, a lot for growing big.""  The passage focuses on their plant-eating diet as a key aspect of their life.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap garab bu am ay car yu dëgër:** The passage doesn't mention them eating other animals (carnivores).
* **C: Ap seku:** ""Seku"" refers to species, and while the passage mentions Triceratops as a species, it doesn't say *what* they ate.
* **D: Ap garab ak ay doom yu tooke:** The passage specifies they ate plants, not both plants and other animals.

The text explicitly states: ""Futbalu nasiyonaal bu Itaali, ak ekip nasiyonaalu Almaañ mooy ñaareelu ekip bu ëpp ndam ci addina bi te jëloon na Kup di Monde bu FIFA ci atum 2006."" (The Italian national football team and the German national team were the two best teams in the world and played in the 2006 FIFA World Cup). This clearly identifies football as a prominent sport in Italy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Volebool:** While mentioned as a sport Italians participate in, it's not highlighted as being particularly dominant or successful.
*   **C: Palaansu nees (Basketball):**  Also mentioned, but not given the same prominence as football.
*   **D: F1 kursu moto (F1 car racing):** Listed among the sports, but again, not the focus of the text's emphasis on Italian sporting success.

This translates to ""The Italian national football team, and the German national team, were the two best teams in the world and played in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final.""  The question asks which sport made Italy world champions. Therefore, it is football.

The other options are mentioned as sports Italians participate in, but football is specifically linked to winning a world championship."
Aparee ban xew-xew la yenn faanu Luxembourg nekke Belge?,"The correct answer is **B: Revolution Belge bi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...dañoo bokkoon ci Liksambuur demb waaye dañoo mujj doon waa Belzik bu Rewolisiyon Belzik bi amoon ci atI 1830 yi weesoo.""  This translates to ""...they were part of Luxembourg but wanted to be Belgian due to the Belgian Revolution of 1830.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Xare bu njëkk bi ci biir àddina bi (The First World War):** While Luxembourg was affected by both World Wars, the text doesn't say this *caused* the separation from Belgium.
*   **C: Ñaareelu Xare bi ci biir àddina bi (The Second World War):** Same reasoning as above.
*   **D: Sàncup Union Européenne bi (The creation of the European Union):**  The EU happened much later and wasn't a *cause* of Luxembourg's earlier connection/separation from Belgium.



"
Ban ci yii toop ñoo laal ñàkk bokk bu Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Occupation Almand**.

Here's why:

*   The text specifically mentions Luxembourg was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II (""Alëmaañ moko moomoon ci Xare bu Wër Addina I ak Xare bu Wër Addina II""). This is a significant historical event for Luxembourg.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bokk ci Union Européenne bi (Joining the European Union):** While true, the text states Luxembourg *joined* the EU in 1957, it doesn’t portray it as a major defining *event* in its history like the occupations were.
*   **C: Revolution Belge bi (Belgian Revolution):** The text mentions the Belgian Revolution as a background event *leading* to Luxembourg's independence, but it wasn’t a defining event *of* Luxembourg’s history.
*   **D: Nekk ap réew mu tembe (Becoming an independent country):** The text states Luxembourg became independent in 1839, but this is an outcome, not a major event *within* its history like the occupations.

The text states: ""...ak 23 764 kaare kilometres (9 174 sq mi) ci Ërop."" which translates to ""...and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.""

Therefore, the area of Turkey in Europe is 23,764 square kilometers.



"
"Ci kaw lu ñu wax, ñaata kilomeetar la guddaayu Turquie?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Suufuk Turkey ëpp na 1 600 kilometres (1 000 mi) ci guddaay..."" which translates to ""Turkey extends 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) to the east...""

Therefore, the answer is 1600 kilometers."
Lan la ñuy jëfëndikoowee kàllaama Latin ci dëkk Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Xew xewu diine** (Religious ceremonies).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Latin mom lañuy jëfandikoo yennsaay ci xew xewu diine yi."" which translates to ""...Latin is still used during religious ceremonies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jokkoo bës bu nekk:** (A specific existing place) - The text doesn't mention Latin being used in a particular location within the Vatican.
*   **C: Yoon:** (Yes) - This is just an affirmation and doesn't answer *where* Latin is used.
*   **D: Wax ak mbooloo mi yëpp:** (Others and their descendants) - This is unrelated to the question.



"
"Ci dëkkum Vatican, lan la ñu dul jëfëndikoowulee kàllaama Italien?","The correct answer is **A: Yoon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bërëb Watikaa kàllaama italien lay jëfandikoo ci seen sart ak bataaxal yu werr."" This translates to ""The Vatican frequently speaks Italian in its offices and with its various departments."" Therefore, Italian *is* spoken at the Vatican.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wax ak mbooloo mi yëpp:** The text doesn't say it's sometimes spoken.
*   **C: Xew xewu diine:** While religion is central to the Vatican, this isn't what the question asks about language.
*   **D: Jokkoo bës bu nekk:** This means ""a different thing"" and doesn't relate to the question.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii mooy jariñoo ci mixe soon ci ay ordinatër yu xarañ?","The correct answer is **A: Musik**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Denuy aristé musik jaralé ko ci ay ordinater yu rafet ngir defar ak jaxasé ay son.""  This translates to ""Many artists store music on computers suitable for creating and sharing sounds.""
* **Q (the question) asks:** What is commonly found mixed on computers?

Since the passage specifically mentions music being stored and worked with on computers, **Musik** is the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Animasion yi (Animations):** The passage doesn't mention animations.
* **C: Nataal yi (Stories):** The passage doesn't mention stories.
* **D: Tabax yi (Errors):** The passage doesn't mention errors.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu ëp ci kër yi ci ban bërëp la wanag yi amee chasu ndox?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dëkki Harappa ak Mohenjo-dar am na benn wanag bu xonk cii daana ka kër gu nekk..."" (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were among the oldest cities in the world...) This directly links Mohenjo-daro to being an ancient city.
* **The question asks:** Which of these places was an ancient city?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Perse (Persia):**  While Persia (now Iran) has a long history, the passage mentions it as a place *contemporary* with the Harappan civilization, not as one of the oldest cities itself.
* **C: Santorin:**  The passage mentions Santorini (as part of the Minoan civilization) as being *related* to Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in terms of potential connections, not as a city being asked about.
* **D: Chine (China):** Similar to Persia, China is mentioned as a contemporary civilization, not specifically as one of the oldest cities referenced in the context of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.



"
Ci yan bërëp yii toop la ñu gisoon ay tërëlinu foos yu yees?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Dëkki Harappa ak Mohenjo-dar am na benn wanag bu xonk cii daana ka kër gu nekk..."" (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are among the oldest cities found...)  The question asks which of the listed options was found as ancient cities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Santorin:** The text mentions Santorini *in relation to* the Minoan civilization, not as a place where these ancient cities were *found*.
*   **C: Egypte:** The text mentions Egypt as a place with contemporary civilizations *to* Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, not a place where *they* were found.
*   **D: Chine:** Similar to Egypt, China is mentioned as a place with a contemporary civilization.



"
Ban ci yii toop mooy tax ba ap patiinkat mëna wëndeelu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñaari boor yi ci kaw wéñu patin bi**.

Here's why:

* **P** describes a situation with a lot of people (ñaari) and a lot of skating (galas/skate). It highlights that many people are skating *because* of the good weather (wet ak xóot xóot).  The passage emphasizes the *number* of people skating.
* **Q** asks what is a common reason people skate.
* **B** directly addresses this by saying ""People skate because of good weather"" (Ñaari boor yi ci kaw wéñu patin bi - people skate when the weather is good).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbir mu roon bi ci suufu wéñu patiin bi** (The shade is good for skating) - While shade might be *pleasant*, it's not a common *reason* to start skating.
* **C: Mën mënu patiinkat bi yëpp** (All types of skating) - This doesn't answer *why* people skate, just that there are different kinds.
* **D: Kalitéwu galaas bi** (The quality of the skating) - The passage doesn't focus on the quality of the skating, but rather the *amount* of skating happening.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and relevant answer based on the information in **P** and the question in **Q**."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy wone ci bu baax pax mi nekk ci kaw wéñu patiinwu galaas bu mingoog jàmono?","The correct answer is **C: Konkav**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) describes a concave (konkav) shape.**  The passage talks about something being ""curved"" or ""hollowed"" - specifically the galas (skates) and how they fit the feet.  This is a clear description of a concave form.  The passage details how the shape helps with grip and movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wuy dagg ci ñaari boor yi:** (Something about many feet) - This isn't related to the *shape* being discussed.
* **B: Roon:** (Round) -  The passage describes a curve *into* something, not a roundness.
* **D: Dëng:** (Straight) - The passage directly implies a non-straight shape.



Therefore, **Konkav (Concave)** is the only option that accurately reflects the description in the passage."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy yoon miy bàyyi xarefulwoon yi ñu dog kàttan mi ëp ci leer gi?","The correct answer is **B: Di génnee ay foton yu ñu junj**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nataal bi ci topp dafay wone atom yuy génnee ay photons."" (The top of the atom emits photons.) and ""Dëgëntaan, ci dëgg-dëgg photons yi ñoo gëna tuuti yi nekk ci nataal bi."" (Furthermore, photons are generated within the atom).  The question asks what is being emitted, and the passage clearly states it's photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ceeneeral:**  ""Ceeneeral"" (generally) doesn't describe *what* is being emitted, but *how* it's happening.
*   **C: Foton:** ""Foton"" (photon) is what *is* emitted, but the question asks what is being *done* – the action is *generating* photons.
*   **D: Di géennee ay ceeneeral yu ñu junj:** This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.



"
Lan mooy tax ap xarefulwoon di génnee ap foton?,"The correct answer is **B: Junj yu leer gu ëp indi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nataal bi ci topp dafay wone atom yuy génnee ay photons."" (The sun generates photons from its atoms.)
* **It also says:** ""Dëgëntaan, ci dëgg-dëgg photons yi ñoo gëna tuuti yi nekk ci nataal bi."" (Then, photons are generated in the core of the sun.)
* **""Junj yu leer""** translates to ""core of the sun"" and **""gu ëp indi""** means ""specifically"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di génnee kàttan gu ëp:** (Generates small things specifically) - Too vague. The passage is specific about *photons*.
* **C: Tolluwaayu kàttan gu dalul:** (Generates small waves) - Incorrect, it's not about waves, but particles (photons).
* **D: Ap tolluwaay jëf yu neexul:** (Generates beautiful layers) - Completely unrelated to the content.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy warali ap lamp bañatee dox?","The correct answer is **A: Bu ñu feyulee bu baax lamp yi**.

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a broken light bulb filament.** The passage emphasizes the importance of having spare bulbs (""daño wara sopi ampul bi. Daño wara def dank si ñu koy soppiwee."").  This directly relates to having enough lamps available.
* **Option A (""Bu ñu feyulee bu baax lamp yi"" - If you have enough lamps)** addresses this need.  Having enough lamps prevents being left in the dark when one breaks.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Am wéñu lamp bi dugg tuuti ci duy bi (The color of the lamp is important in the room):** Color isn't the primary concern when a bulb breaks.
    * **C: Wéñ bi nekk ci biir lamp bi di tàkk (The shape of the lamp in the room is important):** Shape is also irrelevant to the issue of a broken bulb.
    * **D: Ni mbëj bi di duggee ci duy bi di wàññeekoo (If the seed is planted in the room it will grow):**  This is completely unrelated to the text.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo mëna doon lu woorula laal ci booy palaasewaat ap lamp?,"The correct answer is **A: Wéñ miy tàkk** (The filament is broken).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a broken filament inside a light bulb.** It states the filament is ""nekk"" (broken) and explains the bulb doesn't light up.  The rest of the passage talks about the consequences of this broken filament – needing to replace the bulb or use a different lamp.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Kontaktu lamp bi (The lamp's contact)** - While contact issues *can* cause a lamp not to work, the passage specifically focuses on the broken filament.
    * **C: Baasu lamp bi (The base of the lamp)** -  The base isn't the issue described.
    * **D: Kaabal bi (The cable)** - The cable isn't mentioned as the problem.

The passage directly points to a broken filament as the reason the light isn't working, making ""Wéñ miy tàkk"" the only logical answer.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy xew bu ap noyau xajëloo?","The correct answer is **A: Dañuy am ay feppsaal** (It releases a lot of heat).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes nuclear fission.** It explains how splitting atoms (specifically mentioning protons and neutrons in the nucleus) releases energy.  The phrase ""dafay soxla enersi"" (releases energy) is key.  The passage also states ""xaru xóox bi dafay bayyi waat benn xaaj ci enersi bi"" (a lot of heat is released with the energy).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kàttan mooy génne** (Size is generation) - This has nothing to do with nuclear fission.
* **C: Xarefulwoon yi duñu dalati** (Researchers are diligent) - This describes *who* might study fission, not *what* happens *during* fission.
* **D: Dañuy ñàkk feppmaandu yi** (It doesn't release commands) -  Completely irrelevant to the process.

**Therefore, the passage clearly indicates a significant release of heat as a result of nuclear fission, making option A the correct answer.**



"
Ban ci yii toop mooy wone woote yi ci diggënte ay bërëp yu sorentoo lool jëm ci suuf,"The correct answer is **A: Teleskop yi (The telescopes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists used telescopes to observe things in the sky because the atmosphere is clear and provides good visibility. The question asks what tools are used to observe things in the sky, and the passage directly identifies telescopes as those tools.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Satelit yi (The satellites):** The passage talks *about* satellites being launched, but doesn't say they are used for *observing* - they *are* observed.
*   **C: Leer yi (The air/atmosphere):** The atmosphere is mentioned as being *clear*, allowing for better observation, but isn't the tool itself.
*   **D: Roket yi (The rockets):** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, but aren't used for observing.



"
Ban ci yii la ñuy jëfëndikoo ngir yoobu ap teleskop ci biir jàwwu ji?,"The correct answer is **C: Diwaanu suuf si** (Atmosphere).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Scientifique dañuy jëfandikoo ay télescope ci jawwu ji **ndax atmosphère u suuf si dafay soppi sunu leer ak sunu gis-gis.**""  This translates to: ""Scientists use telescopes in space *because* the atmosphere is often cloudy and hazy.""

Therefore, the reason for using telescopes in space is to overcome the limitations of the atmosphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Féso yu leer** (Bright objects) - The passage doesn't mention needing to see bright objects specifically.
*   **B: Roket yi** (Rockets) - Rockets are *used to launch* the telescopes, not the reason *for* using them.
*   **D: Satelit yu nekk ca kawa kaw roomb 100 tànk ci kaw** (Satellites located about 100 tanks away) - This is a detail about the satellites themselves, not the reason for using telescopes in space.



"
Ban la ñu wara bind jëm ci ap xew xew siklik ngir mëna toop ni waxtu bi di demee?,"The correct answer is **A: Diir bi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ñu bari amal nañu njàngat ci waxtu wi, muy kilifay diine, philosophe yi ak scientifique yi ci diir bu yàgg lool."" This translates to: ""Many people search for meaning in time, very often religion, philosophers and scientists in a very great way.""  The passage then links this search for meaning to understanding the nature of time and its complexities.

Therefore, the question ""Ban la ñu wara bind jëm ci ap xew xew siklik ngir mëna toop ni waxtu bi di demee?"" (Who seeks to find the truth in cyclical changes to understand what time means?) is best answered by **""Diir bi""** (The truth).  The passage emphasizes the *search for understanding* time's meaning, which equates to seeking the truth about it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nu muy delusiwaatee** (We are very deluded) - The passage doesn't suggest delusion, but rather a legitimate search for understanding.
* **C: Laal** (Pain) - While time can be associated with hardship, the passage's focus is on understanding, not suffering.
* **D: Jafe jafe** (Nothing) - The passage strongly implies there *is* meaning to be found, even if it's complex.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban faanu ap xew la ñuy jëfëndikoo waxtoom ngir mingële?","The correct answer is **A: Guddaay (Good)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of time and learning from the past.** It states that people in the past (philosophers, scientists) were very wise and that we should learn from their experiences and mistakes.  The passage suggests time *helps* us understand things.
* **The question (Q) asks what benefit people get from remembering the past (waxtu) to understand the present (mingële).**
* **""Guddaay"" (Good) directly aligns with the passage's message.**  Remembering the past is *good* because it allows us to learn and improve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nu muy delusiwaatee (We are deceived):** The passage doesn't suggest deception; it promotes learning and wisdom.
* **C: Jaar jaar (Very quickly/Soon):** This doesn't relate to the benefit of remembering the past.
* **D: Laal (Pain):**  While learning from mistakes can be difficult, the passage doesn’t frame the past as solely painful. It focuses on the *wisdom* gained.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moom la ñuy jappee lu nuroo ngir kiy doon toog ci bangu nguur gi?","The correct answer is **A: Am ap lijaasa 2:2**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Charles demoon na ca iniwersité ba nekk ca Trinity College, Cambridge fimu jàngee Anthropologie ak Archéologie, ak Istuwaar bu xóot, jëlee fa ab 2:2 (ab lijaasa bu ñaareelu kalaas bu gëna ndàw)."" This directly translates to ""Charles studied at a university specifically Trinity College, Cambridge studying Anthropology and Archaeology, and History, and obtained a 2:2 (a good honours degree).""

The question asks what was considered a good thing about Charles. Getting a 2:2 degree is presented as a positive achievement (""lijaasa bu ñaareelu"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bàyyi daara ju màgg ji ngir bokk ci arme bi:** The passage mentions he joined the British Royal Navy *after* his degree, not that having a good degree helped him get into a good school.
* **C: Jàng Taariix:** He studied History, but that's not highlighted as a particularly good thing in itself.
* **D: Dem ca daara ju màgg ji balaa di bokk ci arme bi:** Similar to B, this focuses on the Navy and isn't the primary point being made about his accomplishments.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar buñ ñu jox ci lu ñu bind, Charles moo nekkoon ku njëkk di def lan?","The correct answer is **A: Bokk ci soldaar yi balaa muy pare jàng** (A member of the British Royal Navy).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Charles moo nekkoon ki njëkka bokk ci Njabootu British Royal kuñu jox lijaasa.""  This directly translates to ""Charles was a member of the British Royal Navy before studying.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jàng arkeolosi** (Studying archeology) - While Charles *studied* archeology, the passage focuses on what he did *before* university.
* **C: Am ap lijaasa** (He got a degree) - The passage mentions his degree result (2:2) but doesn't make this the primary thing he did before studying.
* **D: Dem ci daaray Trinité** (Went to Trinity) - Again, this describes where he *studied*, not what he did *before* studying.



"
Ci ban réew la gaalu Trygvasson yi jogeewoon?,"The correct answer is **D: Norvège**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ki jiite woon gaal googu mooy Olaf Trygvasson, kenn ci doomi Norvége bi amoon yéene génne réewam ci buumu njaam gi ko Danmàrk yeewoon.""  This translates to ""Among them was Olaf Trygvasson, who originally came from Norway and later ruled a kingdom in the region bordering Denmark.""

Therefore, Olaf Trygvasson is from Norway. The question asks where the Trygvasson people (meaning Olaf Trygvasson and his followers) originated from.



"
Ci ban waxtu ci taariix la Almaañ amee ap jiitël bu rëy ci cosaanub Estonie?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci boorup 200 àt ca ganaaw**.

Here's why, based on the text (P):

The text mentions that Germans (""ay baat yu bari yu nu baboon ci German"") began to settle in Estonia (""Estonie"") to preach about God (""dëkk jege Yalla""). It also states they brought with them their literature (""lañu sos làkku litereer bu Estoni"").  This strongly implies a period of German influence and settlement, placing it around the 200s AD (boorup 200 àt ca ganaaw) as that is when German tribes began expanding and interacting with other regions.

The other options are less likely:

* **B, C, and D:** These suggest much earlier periods which don't align with the historical context of German expansion and the introduction of German culture/religion to Estonia.



"
Kàllaama Estonie lan moo ko junjoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Bataaxal Õ/õ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""benn araf """"Õ/õ"""" lañ ci yokk"" (one letter """"Õ/õ"""" is missing from it). This refers to a letter present in Estonian but not readily found in the German alphabet, which is what the speaker is discussing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Alfabet wu Almaañ** - While the alphabet *is* discussed, the passage focuses on a *difference* between the Estonian and German alphabets, not the German alphabet itself.
*   **C: Moine Almaañ yi** - The Germans are mentioned, but the passage isn't *about* them, it's about the Estonian language.
*   **D: Yàlla** - God is mentioned in the context of a blessing (""nit ñi dëkk jege Yalla""), but is not the central topic of what the Estonian speaker is missing.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, xaymawu ñaata ñooy làkk Hindi kàllaama gu ñu juddoo di gën di wàññeeku ndax lan?","The correct answer is **A: Ndax dialekt yu nuroo lool ak Hindi dañu leen di lim** (Because many dialects similar to Hindi are easy for them to learn).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Xayma nanu ko ne moo nekk ci diggante ñaareel ak ñenteel làkk bi nu gëna wax ci addina. Gni ñu jàpp ni ñoo namm làkk wi mën na wuute, lépp di aju ci ndax dañu ciy boole ñiy làkk rakki làkk wi (dialecte).""  This translates to: ""These people find it easy because their language is close to many languages spoken in the world. When they learn a language, it's easy for them because they already know dialects (of that language).""
* **The question asks:** Why are Hindi speakers able to learn the language easily?
* **Option A** directly reflects the passage's explanation: the similarities between Hindi and various dialects make learning easier.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndax dañuy lim ñuy làkk kàllaama Ourdou** (Because they can easily learn the Urdu language) - While Urdu is mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on Urdu being easy *for them* to learn, but rather highlights the existing connections to Hindi.
* **C: Ndax dañuy lim nit ñu mëna degg kàllaama bi** (Because they can easily learn the language they speak) - This is circular reasoning and doesn't explain *why* they learn it easily.
* **D: Ndax dañuy lim nit yi mëna jàng kàllaama bi** (Because they can easily learn the language they grew up with) - Similar to C, this doesn't explain the *reason* for their learning aptitude.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo di ap baat bu dëggu jëm ci kàllaama Hindi ak Ourdou?,"The correct answer is **A: Tàmm na di am ay ñàkk deggoo ci diggënte ñii di làkk ñaari kàllaama yii** (There are some differences in the way these languages are spoken).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Indo yi ak Urdu yi dañoo niiro ci seen bind waaye ci dañoo wuute ci xeetu bindiin; ñiy lakk ñaari lakk yooyu mën nañu dégante."" This translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are similar in their writing but differ in their spoken form; their dialects are different from each other.""  This directly indicates differences in how the languages are *spoken*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dañu wuute ci bind** (They are written in writing) - The passage states they are *similar* in writing, not that this is the defining characteristic.
* **C: Dañu bokk baat ak mbind ñoom ñaar ñëpp** (They have things in common with their writings) - Too vague and doesn't address the core difference highlighted in the text.
* **D: Dañu wuute ci baat** (They are spoken in speech) - This is a general statement and doesn’t specifically address the differences between the two languages as described in the passage.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul ap mbir mu dëggu jëm ci alfabet Hangeul gi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñeenteelu buur bi ci nguurup Joseon moo ko sàkkoon** (The fifth king of the Joseon dynasty commissioned it).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sejong, moo doonoon ñeenteelu buuru dynastie Joseon di kenn ci ñi ci gënoon am tur."" (Sejong, was the fifth king of the Joseon dynasty who was known for his wisdom).  It then goes on to say he initiated the creation of Hangeul.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañu ko sàkkoon ci ndoorteelu nguuru Buur Sejong** (It was commissioned by the fourth king, King Sejong) - Incorrect. The passage states *fifth* king.
* **B: Turu alfabet bi bu njëkk moo doon Hunan Jeongeum** (The name of the alphabet at first was Hunan Jeongeum) - Incorrect. Hunmin Jeongeum is the *name* given to the document *describing* the alphabet, not the alphabet's initial name.
* **D: Daraa tax ñu sàkk ko** (After many years they commissioned it) - Incorrect. The passage doesn't mention a long period before commissioning.  It states Sejong directly initiated it.



"
Alfabet Hunmin Jeongeum sopiwoon nañu ko ngir mu doon lan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sejong**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mingi tuddoon tuddeewoon Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeogeum, lu tekki “coow lu jaar yoon ngir jàngal waa dëkk bi”."" This translates to ""King Sejong created the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeogeum, which means ""a correct and easy sound for instructing the people."" 

Therefore, Sejong is the one who created the alphabet.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, yan kàllaama la Sanskrit junj?","The correct answer is **A: Ay kàllaama Latin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dañ koy méngaléek Lateŋ buñuy làkk ci Orop."" which translates to ""It is related to Latin and many languages in Europe."" and ""ci moom la làkk yu bees yu waa Inde yu bari sosoo, ni làkki waa europe yu bari sosoo ci latin..."" which translates to ""...and many ancient languages of India, as well as many European languages based on Latin, like French and Spanish.""

This directly links Sanskrit to the origins of Latin and subsequently, European languages. Therefore, the language family related to Sanskrit is Latin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ay kàllaama Européen** - While related *to* European languages, it's not a European language *family* itself. Sanskrit predates most European languages.
*   **C: Kàllaama yu yàgg yi** - ""Ancient languages"" is too broad. The text specifies a more direct connection.
*   **D: Ay kàllaama Indien** - While Sanskrit originated in India, the question asks about its *related* language family, and the text points to Latin as the key connection.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, nu ñu doon jëfëndikoowee Sanskrit wàññeekuwoon na ndax lan?","The correct answer is **B: Gàddaayu Aryenne**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Benn si ñoom moy Tukkib Aryan ci soowu Inde..."" (They came from the Aryan tribes in the north of India...)  This directly links the origins of Sanskrit to the Aryan people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Laxasoo:**  This doesn't relate to the origin of Sanskrit as described in the passage.
* **C: Ay kàllaama Latin:** The passage mentions a *connection* between Sanskrit and Latin (and later French/Spanish), but doesn't say Sanskrit *originated* from Latin.  It says they are related.
* **D: Ierarsi:** This isn't mentioned in the passage in relation to the origin of Sanskrit.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop mooy ap baat bu dëggu jëm ci gravite ci Io?","The correct answer is **A: Gravitéwu suuf dina këcc lu neew ci yow wuuteeg gravité bu Io**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds on Io. This *directly* indicates that Io's gravity is significantly *less* than Earth's gravity.
* **Option A** accurately reflects this: ""Gravitéwu suuf dina këcc lu neew ci yow wuuteeg gravité bu Io"" translates to ""Earth's gravity is much higher than Io's gravity.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** ""Gravité bu Io mooy gëna këcc, liy waral nga wara peese lu neew"" - This says Io's gravity is less, but doesn't emphasize *how much* less, and the phrasing is awkward.
* **C:** ""Gravité Io dafay këcc lu bare, liy waral nga wara gëna am poids"" - This says Io's gravity is very less, which isn't quite accurate. The passage implies a specific, measurable difference (200 lbs vs 36 lbs).
* **D:** ""Gravitéwu suuf dina këcc lu bare ci yeen wuuteeg gravité Io"" - This says Earth's gravity is *very* higher than Io's gravity.  While true, ""much higher"" (lu neew) is a more accurate description based on the proportional weight difference given in the passage.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci baat yii mooy wone ci bu baax muurukaayu weer bi nekk ci biti?","The correct answer is **A: Wet bu jege bi am na ap krut bu gëna sew**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dal bi amna 70 km ci dëllaay ci wet gu jege gi ak 100 km ci dëllaay ci wet gu sori gi."" (The distance is 70 km on the northern side and 100 km on the southern side.)  and ""Dina gëna yomb su safara wolkan bi yeegoon ci kaw ëtt."" (They found a safe passage through the volcanic rocks on the eastern side.)
* **The question asks:** What is the best description of the land in the passage?
* **Option A** directly relates to the information given about the northern side (wet bu jege - northern side) and the fact that it's where the crater is located (krut bu gëna sew - crater that can be seen).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While there are tunds (hills/plateaus) mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on the crater being *in* those tunds.
* **C & D:**  The passage mentions maria (lava fields), but focuses more on the crater and the distances involved. It doesn’t emphasize new maria.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la krutu weer bi gëna sewee?","The correct answer is **A: Ci wet gi jege**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dal bi amna 70 km ci dëllaay ci wet gu jege gi ak 100 km ci dëllaay ci wet gu sori gi."" (The distance is 70 km on the lower side and 100 km on the upper side.)  This clearly indicates the krutu (volcano) is located on the ""wet gi jege"" (lower side).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Fu ay maria yu gëna bare nekk:** The text doesn't specifically say the volcano is *in* the maria (seas), only that maria are present.
* **C: Ci suufu tund yu kawe yi:** The text doesn't mention ""tund"" (plains) or ""kawe"" (distant).
* **D: Ci suufu maria bi:** While maria are mentioned, the precise location is tied to the ""wet gi jege.""



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñeen ñi gëm?","The correct answer is **A: Nit ñi tukki nañu ci yeneeni biddéew** (People search for them in other worlds).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ñu bari ñu ngi am yaakaar ni bis dina ñëw nit ñi mêna dem ci yeneen plante ngir xam yeneen barab..."" - This translates to ""They believe there are other beings, and people go to other planets to find them..."" This directly supports the idea that people *search* for them in other worlds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nit ñi amu ñu kàttanu dem gëstu yeneeni àddina** - This translates to ""People want to cut them and take them to our world."" The passage doesn't mention anything about harming or capturing these beings.
* **C: Dund am na ci yeneen palaanet yi** - This translates to ""There is life on other planets."" While the passage implies the *possibility* of life, it doesn't definitively state it *exists*. It focuses on the *search* for it.
* **D: Am na lu gëna neew triliyoon kilomeetar ci diggënte biddéew yi** - This translates to ""There is something that goes a trillion kilometers away from the worlds."" This refers to the distances traveled by searches, not the beings themselves.



"
Lan mooy gën di sew ci li ngay gën di sore diggu naaj gi?,"The correct answer is **A: Plasma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gas bi dafay waññeeku soo leen di sori diggu Naaj wi."" (Gas transforms into something that surrounds the sun) and later describes this ""something"" as being related to the ""fotosfeer"" (photosphere) and called a ""bulu limiyeer"" (luminous halo).  The text earlier mentions ""safara ak plaasma"" (layers and plasma) as things that can surround. Given this context, the substance surrounding the sun is **plasma**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xal (Sand)** - Sand is not relevant to the sun's composition or surrounding layers.
*   **C: Gaaz (Gas)** - The text says the gas *transforms* into something else, it doesn't stay as gas.
*   **D: Krut (Solid)** - The sun is not solid in its outer layers.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban waalu naaj gi la ñu mëna gisee ci kaw suuf?","The correct answer is **C: Fotosfeer bi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...buy tekki “bulu limiyeer”."" (and they call it ""blue limiter"").  It then connects this ""blue limiter"" to the *fotosfeer* (photosphere) - ""...si biti buñuy gis sunuy xool ci naaj wi moom lañuy woowee fotosfeer..."" (which is a layer that surrounds the stars in our sky and lies above the photosphere...).

The question asks what the passage identifies as being named ""blue limiter."" The passage *directly* identifies the *fotosfeer* as being called ""blue limiter.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Krut bi (The crust):** The passage doesn't mention a ""crust.""
*   **B: Plasma bi (Plasma):** While plasma is mentioned, it isn't the thing called ""blue limiter.""
*   **D: Digg bi (Soil):** Soil is mentioned only in the context of Naaj (stars), but it's not what the passage is defining.



"
Ban ci yii ñu seetlu ñoo dimbali ci di dëggël teori bu Copernic?,"The correct answer is **B: Ap taraansitu Venus**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ginaaw ba, ci atum 1639, benn astronome anglais bu toddu Jeremiah Horrocks seetlu yoon wu jëm ci Vénus.""  This directly translates to ""Later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.""
* **Transits of Venus** (when Venus passes between the Earth and the Sun) were crucial observations supporting the Copernican theory. They allowed for more accurate calculations of the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and thus validated the heliocentric (sun-centered) model.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xët yi nekk ci Venus (Spots on Venus):** While Galileo observed features on Venus, these weren't the key observations supporting Copernicus.
* **C: Niroolewu naaj gi ak venus (Revolution of Venus):** Knowing Venus revolves around the Sun was already established, the transit was *how* they verified the distances.
* **D: Niroolewu naaj gi ak weer gi (Revolution of Venus and the Moon):**  The moon's revolution isn't directly tied to supporting the Copernican theory in this context.



"
Ban ci bii toop la Galilée seetluwoon ca àtum 1610?,"The correct answer is **D: Ap taraansitu Venus**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Galileo Galilei jëfandikoo ab telekop ngir xool ndax Venus am na ay jéego, melni weer wi."" This translates to ""Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe Venus and its phases, like the moon.""  These phases are only visible because Venus *transits* (passes in front of) the sun from our perspective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ap wetu weer gi jaakarloog naaj gi:** (The light of the stars reflected by the sun) - While Venus reflects sunlight, the passage doesn't focus on this.
* **B: Xët yi nekk ci Venus:** (Spots on Venus) - The passage doesn't mention spots.
* **C: Palaanet yii di wër naaj gi:** (Planets that orbit the sun) - The passage alludes to this (supporting Copernicus's theory), but it's not *what* Galileo specifically observed in 1610.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la dexub Amazon bi di tankee ndox?","The correct answer is **A: Ay dex yu gëna ndaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""20% ci ndox miy joge ci dex yi di tuuru ci géej gi mingi bawoo ci Amazonie."" This translates to ""20% of the fish travel to the forests that are abundant in Amazonia.""  The question asks *what* the Amazon river supports/is known for.  Fish are the direct answer given in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dex bu gëna gudd:** While the passage mentions the river is large, it's not the *reason* it's important to the surrounding environment.
*   **C: Geej yi:** The forests are a destination *for* the fish, not what the river itself is known for supporting.
*   **D: Ñaareelu dex bu gëna ngand:**  The text doesn't focus on the number of rivers or specifically ""many rivers.""



"
Ban ràññële la ñu joxul Dexu Amazon bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Moo di ñaareelu dex bu gëna gudd**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Dexu Amazon mooy ñaareelu dex bi gëna gudd..."" which translates to ""The Amazon River is the largest river in the world...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moo di dex bu gëna ngand** - The text doesn't mention anything about the Amazon being ""fast"".
* **C: Moo di dex bu gëna gudd** - While similar to A, it's a repetition and doesn't capture the nuance of being *the* largest.
* **D: Moo di dex bu gëna yaatu** - While the text mentions the Amazon is long, it doesn't define it primarily by its length. Its primary characteristic stated is its size (""gudd"").



"
Ban rëddu liggéeykat yu ñu lim ci lu ñu bind mooy jëfëndikoo mbooloom Venezuelien bu gëna neew?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes the difficult economic situation in Venezuela.** It talks about shortages, people leaving, and the reliance on oil.  The question (Q) asks about the *reasons* people are leaving.
* **""Mbay"" means ""no"" or ""not"" in Wolof.** The passage heavily implies that people are leaving *because* of the economic hardship – the lack of food, jobs, and opportunities. Therefore, the answer is implying that the reasons are linked to the hardships.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Yewwute gu ndefar:** (Defiant youth) - While youth may be involved, this isn’t the core reason for the emigration.
    * **C: Diw:** (Religion) - Religion isn’t the driving force behind the mass exodus.
    * **D: Njariñ:** (To steal) - This is completely unrelated to the context.

**In short, the passage paints a picture of hardship that compels people to leave, and ""mbay"" (no/not) acknowledges that the hardship is the reason.**



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci sektër yii mooy jëfëndikoo Venezuelien yu gëna bare ngir ñu liggéey?","The correct answer is **A: Njariñ (Yes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states that many Venezuelans are migrating due to the economic crisis.** It mentions difficulties finding work (""ñu liggéey""), problems with industry (""Industri""), and the reliance on oil (""Petorol koom gu am solo la ci koom koomu Venezuela"").  It highlights the hardship and the desire to find better opportunities elsewhere.
* **The question (Q) asks if the difficulties are driving Venezuelan migration.**  

Therefore, the passage confirms the link between the economic problems and the emigration, making ""Njariñ"" (Yes) the logical and correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbay (No):** The passage clearly indicates a *reason* for migration.
* **C: Yewwute gu ndefar (Unclear/Ambiguous):** The passage is quite direct about the reasons for migration.
* **D: Diw (All):** While many sectors might be affected, the passage doesn't state *all* sectors are driving migration, but rather emphasizes the economic situation as a whole.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la fusion di may biddéew yi def?","The correct answer is **A: Di defar ay mbir yu gëna diis** (It creates energy like the sun).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Biddew yi dañuy génnee leeraay ak tangoor ndax enersi bimuy defar biñu seeyaalee atomu ndox yi (wala seeyal) ñu ànd ngir ñu doon mbir yu gëna diis.""  This translates to: ""These processes generate energy like the sun because atoms (or particles) combine to create heavier atoms.""  It directly links the processes to the sun's energy production.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tabax ay fusion reaktër (A fusion reactor):** While fusion reactors *aim* to replicate the sun's energy, the passage doesn't mention reactors. It's talking about the natural process itself.
* **C: Sore leer gi ak tangoor gi (The heat and light):** Heat and light are *results* of the energy production, not the process of *creating* the energy.
* **D: Sàkk ay xarefulwoon hydrogèn (A bag of hydrogen fuel):**  Hydrogen is a fuel *used* in fusion, but the passage is about the *process* of combining atoms, not the fuel itself.



"
Ban ci yii toop la ap fusion reaktër bu am solo di sàkk?,"The correct answer is **B: Biddéew**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Biddew yi dañuy génnee leeraay ak tangoor ndax enersi bimuy defar biñu seeyaalee atomu ndox yi (wala seeyal) ñu ànd ngir ñu doon mbir yu gëna diis.""  This translates to ""Biddew is used to generate energy by fusing atoms (or nuclei) to create heavier elements.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is used in a fusion reactor?""
* **Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies Biddew (Deuterium) as the fuel source for fusion.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hidrogèn (Hydrogen):** While hydrogen *contains* deuterium, the passage specifically mentions ""Biddew"" not just hydrogen.
* **C: Xarefulwoon yi (Uranium):** Uranium is used in *fission* reactors, not fusion reactors.
* **D: Kàttan (Carbon):** Carbon is not a primary fuel source for fusion.



"
Lan lmooy defarluwaay simik bu dox?,"The correct answer is **D: Ñaari xarefulwoon hydrogene ak benn xarefulwoon oxygene** (Several hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).

Here's why, based on the provided text (P):

* **""Ndox mu jaxasoo mi ñaari atomi idorosen aj benn atomu oksisen lañ ko defaree.""** This translates to ""Water is composed of several hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom to form it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A & B:**  The text specifies *several* hydrogen atoms, not just *one*.
* **C:** The text specifies *one* oxygen atom, not *several*.



"
"Bu ndox sopee ci melokaan, lan mooy dess nu mu meloon?","The correct answer is **A: Tërëlinu molecule**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the nature of matter, molecules, and how they combine.** It explains that molecules are formed from atoms (hydrogen and oxygen are specifically mentioned) and can exist as gases, liquids, or solids.
* **Question (Q) asks what happens when matter changes state.**  Changing state *directly* relates to changes in how molecules are arranged and behave.
* **""Tërëlinu molecule"" (molecule arrangement) best fits this description.**  Melting, freezing, boiling, etc., all involve rearranging molecules.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Diisaay (Dissay - meaning dissolution/dissolving):** Dissolving is a process *within* a liquid, not a fundamental change of state.
* **C: Taxawaay ci jëm (Evaporation/boiling):**  While a change of state, it's a specific example, not the general principle being asked about. The question is broader than just evaporation.
* **D: Azot likid (Liquid nitrogen):** This is a specific substance in a specific state.  The question asks about *the process* of changing states, not a particular example.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo nekkulwoon ap jafe jafe ngir fukk ak ñeeteelu réew mi ba ñuy jeema tërël yenn yoon yi?","The correct answer is **B: Ñàkkum doole ci biir Congres bi** (Discussions about the power of Congress).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the powers of Congress.** It discusses what Congress can and cannot do, the limits of its authority, and how its actions affect states. The entire text revolves around the balance of power and the role of Congress in that balance.
* **The question asks about what the text *primarily* discusses.**  While the passage touches on other things, the central theme is the scope of Congressional power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seetlu mu rëy jogee ci njiitu réew yi** (The text speaks clearly about the rights of states) - While states' rights are *mentioned* as being affected by Congress's power, they aren't the *primary* focus.
* **C: Ap amendement miy laaj waawup ñëpp** (About recent proposed amendments) -  Amendments are alluded to, but the passage isn't detailing specific proposed amendments.
* **D: Ap jëfkat national bu amul** (About national economic power) - Economic power is not the central theme of the text.



Therefore, **B** best reflects the main subject of the provided text."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat mooy wone ci bu baax nekkinu njiit mi njëkk mi ci jamono Xare Revolutionnare bi?","The correct answer is **A: Juuti yi Congres bi ak boroom sañ-sañu réew yi dëgërëloon nañu leen** (The decisions of Congress and the leaders of the states were considered).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses a conflict between the central Congress and the individual states.** It highlights how Congress made decisions (""congré kese la nekkoon"") and how the states reacted to them (""leen ko sàrti booloo googu mayee"").  The passage emphasizes that states were *considered* in the process, even if they disagreed.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Amandement yi ci Artikal yi ñungi doon sukkëndiku ci sañ-sañu Congres** (Amendments to articles were intended to be submitted to Congress) - While the passage mentions articles, it doesn't focus on amendments being *submitted* to Congress, but rather how Congress *made* decisions.
    * **C: Ñuy teewal réew mi ñàkkoon nañu ap téewaay** (The power of the states was to have their say) -  The passage shows a power dynamic where Congress *has* power, and states react to it, not necessarily that states had equal say.
    * **D: Gouvernement central bi amoon na ñaar yu ko ëmb** (The central government took responsibility for its actions) - The passage doesn't discuss the central government taking responsibility; it discusses the *process* of decision-making and state reaction.



Therefore, option A best reflects the central theme of the passage – the interplay between Congress and the states, and the consideration given to state opinions."
Naka lañu bindee baat yu nekk ci ganaawu xamle tembte bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci araf yu rëy** (On the yellow areas).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ba bu ken xamul ci lu woor kuko binda, xam nañu ko lu yagg ci dundam, téere bu rëy (ci nat 29¾ baaraam ba 24½ baaraam)"".  This translates to: ""Before they could find the hidden clue, they realized it was written in ink, yellow ink (between 29¾ and 24½ inches).""

Therefore, the clues are found on the yellow areas of the Declaration of Independence.
"
Ban ci yii toop mooy wone siiwaayu Singapour?,"The correct answer is **A: Gàncax mu wert bi ci dëkk bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ni seen xel màcci ci wàll jardin liggéey nañu bu baax ngir réew mi nuru dëkku jardin tropicale."" (its soul is deeply rooted in the walls of gardens, making it a beautiful country, truly a tropical garden).
* **Option A (""Gàncax mu wert bi ci dëkk bi"" - Its value is in its gardens)** directly reflects this idea.  Singapour is famous *because* of its beautiful gardens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dox yi ci kaw tund yu kawe yi (Rocks in the caves of the coast):** This isn't mentioned in the passage and isn't a defining feature of Singapore.
* **C: Tagaatu yaram ni aventur (A meeting of courage and adventure):** While Singapore might *offer* adventure, the passage doesn't focus on that.
* **D: Jëfinu arts (Fine arts):**  While Singapore likely has a thriving arts scene, it's not the primary thing highlighted in the text.



"
Lan mooy Vanda Miis Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **D: Ap monument wu réew mi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci atum 1981, lañu tànn Vanda Miss Joaquim, di njaxasi orchidée muy fleur buy màndargaal réew mi."" This translates to: ""In 1981, they chose Vanda Miss Joaquim, a very beautiful orchid flower, as the national flower.""

Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a national symbol/monument of Singapore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ap dun** -  Means ""it is finished"" - doesn't relate to the text.
*   **B: Ap toor-toor** - Means ""it is a tool"" - doesn't relate to the text.
*   **C: Ap toolub botanik** - Means ""it is a botanical tool"" - while it *is* a flower studied in botany, the text doesn't present it *as* a tool.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ngënelu piramid Giga moo dul woon luy yeemi ak nguuru Egyptiens bu bees bi?","The correct answer is **A: Seeniy àt** (Yes, it is).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Pyramidi Giza benn pyramd mësuleena romb ci guddaay ak xarañte ci wàllu defar."" This translates to ""The Giza pyramids are among the most famous and ancient monuments in the world.""  It also mentions they were built during the Old Kingdom by Egyptians.
* **Q (the question) asks:** Whether the Giza pyramids are connected to the ancient Egyptians.

Since the passage *explicitly* links the pyramids to ancient Egypt, the answer is a clear ""yes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jëfëndikuwaayu xeer:** (It's a complex issue) - The passage doesn't present any complexity, it's a straightforward statement.
* **C: Nuñu tool:** (No, it's not) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **D: Nuñu leen tabaxee:** (No, they didn't build them) - This is also incorrect, the passage clearly states they were built by Egyptians.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la herbivores yi jogee ndax di toop tow li?","The passage discusses the Great Migration (mu nekk suñu demee) – a massive movement of wildebeest (tundu bët-gànnaar) and other herbivores. The question asks what the migrating animals *are*, specifically those that move in large numbers.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Tundu Bët-gànnaar yi** (Wildebeest).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Toolu penku yi** (Birds) - While birds are present, they aren't the primary focus of the migration.
*   **C: Toolu bëj saalum yi** (Fish) - Fish are not part of this land-based migration.
*   **D: Tundu penku yi** (Types of birds) - Similar to A, not the main group migrating.



"
"Suñu sukkandi ci lu ñu bind, ban bërëp la luy dundee ñax di bawoo suñuy waaja yegg Avril?","The correct answer is **C: Dexub Mara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...jeggiwaat dexu Mara, bu taw bi jàllee lu jege weeru Awril."" This directly translates to ""...they return to Mara when the rains end in April.""
* **The question asks:** What is returned to by the animals after April?

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that the animals return to *Dexu Mara* after April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Diwaanu Serengeti:** While Serengeti is mentioned as a location, the passage doesn't say animals return *to* Serengeti after April.
* **B: Toolu bëj saalum yi:**  This translates to ""groups of animals"" and isn't a *place* they return to.
* **D: Dencukaayu Maasai Mara bu Réew mi:** This translates to ""Maasai Mara in my country"". While Maasai Mara is near Mara, the passage specifically refers to *Dexu Mara*.



"
Operation Sealion nekkoon na ap songo ban dëkk?,"The correct answer is **A: Almaañ** (Germany).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alëmaañ mu ngi duppee woon cong gi “Operation Sealion”.""  This directly translates to ""Germany planned the 'Operation Sealion'.""

Therefore, Operation Sealion was planned by Germany.



"
Lan la Almaañ woowee song bi ci kaw Bretaañ?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Alëmaañ mu ngi duppee woon cong gi “Operation Sealion”."" This translates to ""Germany planned an operation called 'Operation Sealion'.""  The passage then explains this operation was the planned invasion of England.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk:** Dunkirk was a *retreat* of Allied forces, not the location of a German invasion plan.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine:** The Kriegsmarine was the German Navy, the force *opposed* to the invasion, not the invasion itself.
*   **D: Royal Navy:** The Royal Navy *defended* against the invasion, it wasn't the invasion plan.



"
Lan la ñu bindul ni ap faan bu am solo ci palangu Italie ngir japp ay réewu Afrik?,"The correct answer is **B: Defar yeneeni gaal**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jubluwaay bu mag bu Itali moo doon dëkku Afrig yi. Ngir jàpp dëkk yooyule, doon na soxla ab dalluwaay bu xeexkat y di jóge jaar ci géeju Meditérane gi te dugg Afrig.""  This translates to: ""Italy greatly wanted to conquer African countries. To achieve this, they had to build strong fleets and sail across the Mediterranean Sea to reach Africa.""

This directly implies the reason for building up Italy's strength was to conquer African countries – to *defar yeneeni gaal* (conquer other lands/countries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dindi gaal yi ci Egypte:** (Fighting the wars in Egypt) - While the text mentions Egypt (Isipt) in relation to England, it doesn't say this was the *reason* for building up Italy's forces.
*   **C: Samp ap ramp ngir yondi trup yi:** (Preparing to send troops) - This is a *method* of achieving the goal, not the goal itself.
*   **D: Yàq baazu Angalé yi:** (Attacking the English base) - This is a specific incident mentioned, not the overarching goal.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la ñu jappeewoon jublukaayu Italie bu njëkk ci xare gi?","The correct answer is **A: Japp réewu Afrik yi** (Conquering African countries).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jubluwaay bu mag bu Itali moo doon dëkku Afrig yi."" This translates to ""The great power of Italy wanted to conquer African countries.""  The passage goes on to describe their attempts to do so through naval power and control of the Mediterranean.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tabax ap arme ak ap marine bu gëna am doole** (Armies and navies with a lot of tools) - While Italy *had* armies and navies, this isn't what they were primarily trying to *do*.
*   **C: Yàq gaalu Egypte yi** (Attacking Egyptian soldiers) - The passage mentions Egypt in relation to conflict with the British, but conquering Egypt isn't stated as the main goal.
*   **D: Samp ay baaz Angalé** (Competing with English bases) -  The passage describes conflict with England over Egypt, but not a general competition for bases.



"
Kan moo samp ay xaritoo ak ñu leen song?,"The correct answer is **A: Almand yi** (The Germans).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci bésu 15 Ut 1940, Kureelu Mbootayub Xeet yi dug nañu bët-saalumu Faraas, ngelaane ñoŋko don wowe ‘’Sëfu wayma jaan’’. Ci ñaari ayubés dong Americains yi ak soldaru Free French wallu nañu sowwu France té jall ci almañ.""

This translates to: ""On August 15, 1940, the Allied troops gave up French soil, allowing some to shout ‘Long live the marshal’. Later, American and Free French soldiers came to liberate France and fight against the Germans.""

The text explicitly mentions fighting *against* the Germans (Almand yi) to liberate France.  The other options were either collaborators (Vichy), helpers in the liberation (Americans, Free French), or the initial people who lost their land (French).

The text states: ""Ci bésu 15 Ut 1940, Kureelu Mbootayub Xeet yi dug nañu bët-saalumu Faraas, ngelaane ñoŋko don wowe ‘’Sëfu wayma jaan’’. Ci ñaari ayubés dong Americains yi ak soldaru Free French wallu nañu sowwu France té jall ci almañ.""

This translates to: ""On August 15, 1940, the Allied Forces began liberating France, and many were called ‘Operation Torch’.  Americans and Free French soldiers helped conquer France and fight the Germans.""

Therefore, ""Operation Torch"" involved both Americans and Free French forces (French forces not aligned with Vichy France).



"
Yokkute ban teknoloji moo waral ba su-marin yi tambalee tukki ci suufu ndox?,"The correct answer is **D: Radaar**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...wanté ba radar yi dooree di yokku te di gëna xarañ."" (…so that radars could not detect or find them). This directly links radar technology to the submarines' ability to operate secretly and effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Su-marin yi** - Submarines themselves aren't a *technology* that helped them stay hidden; they *used* technology.
*   **B: Toolub fitukaay** -  The text doesn't mention toolub fitukaay (communication tools).
*   **C: Navigasion** - While important, navigation wasn't the key factor in avoiding detection – it was being *undetectable* that was crucial, and the text points to radar as the challenge overcome.



"
"Waxtu bu ñu leen njëkkee jëfëndikoo, su-marin yi amoon nañu ap bërëp gu neew jëmëleko ci lan?","The correct answer is **B: Tukki**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sumarin yi lañu daan jëfandikoo ci Përmiyeer Geer Monjaal ak Dësiyeem Geer Monjaal."" (Submarines were heavily used in the First and Second World Wars).  It then continues to talk about how they were *tukki* (fast) in the sea, dodging radar and being difficult to detect.  The question asks about their speed/ability in the water during their use in warfare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Joos** - Means ""yes"", doesn't relate to speed or ability.
*   **C: Fit** - Doesn't have a relevant meaning in this context.
*   **D: Jëf** - Means ""day"", not related to the question.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo jéggi ap sartu diggënte? ","The correct answer is **A: Polonais yi (Poles)**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Kiiraayu Poloñ tasoon naba pare"" which translates to ""Poland was the first country to fall."" The passage describes the events surrounding the invasion of Poland in September 1939.  Therefore, the people who first suffered a fall as described in the text are the Polish people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rumain yi (Romanians):** The text mentions Romania but states they were *benefiting* from the situation, not being the first to fall.
*   **C: Ukrainien yi (Ukrainians):** While Ukrainians were affected by the conflict, the text explicitly states Poland fell first.
*   **D: Sovietik yi (Soviets):** The Soviet Union was the aggressor, *doing* the invading, not the ones falling.



"
Ban ci yii toop la Armé bu Xonk bi mattalulwoon?,"The correct answer is **B: Ap dugg ci diwaanu penku yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...800 000 soldaru Soviet Union Red Army dugguséé té amal kurelu Belarussian ak Ukrainian ginnaw biñu nango dëkk yi ci pénku Poland..."".  This directly translates to ""...800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union Red Army moved to occupy Belarusian and Ukrainian territories entering the lands of Poland..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sàncup ap front Ukrainien:** While the Ukrainian front is mentioned in relation to the movement of troops, the text doesn't say they *were* the Ukrainian front. It states they *moved into* Ukrainian territories.
*   **C: Ap defaraat ci boppu pom bi:** The text doesn’t specifically mention fighting or battles on the West side.
*   **D: Jéggi ap sartu diggënte:** This isn't supported by the text. It doesn't speak about the aim or purpose of the Army's actions, only *where* they moved.



"
Lan moo daloon seef ingeniër bu fukkeelu armé Italien bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Angalé yi ñoo ko jàppoon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci benn ndarkepp ci penku Bardia, Angale yi jàpp nañu Kilifa Inseñër bu Fukkeelu larme bu Itali, Seneral Lastucc."" This translates to: ""During an assault near Bardia, the English captured Italian Army Engineer Colonel Lastucc.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dañu ko jàppoon ca Fort Capuzzo:** He was captured *near* Bardia, not Fort Capuzzo.
*   **B: Dañu ko réyoon ca Tobrouk:** The text mentions Tobruk as a destination for others, but not where Lastucc was captured.
*   **D: Ap fit mu joge ci kaanwam moo ko réy:** This is irrelevant to the text's information about Lastucc.



"

The text states: ""...Marshal Italo Balbo, Guwernor seneral bu Libi ak kuy niroog sëtu Mussolini rey nanu leen ab ray bu anutak tayeef ba ñuy wàcc ca **Tobruk**.""  This means Balbo was heading towards Tobruk.

Therefore, the answer is Tobrouk."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci teknik yii toop moo di faan bu gëna am solo ci waxtu xalaatu Tibetain?","The correct answer is **D: Mën taxawaayu yoga yi** (Practicing taxawaayu yoga).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Kundalini is ""yeejare ko ci taxawaayu yoga"" (activated through taxawaayu yoga). It then goes on to describe taxawaayu yoga as part of the techniques used in Tibetan Buddhism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tagaatu ci nu ñuy nooyee** (Praying to gods) - While deity yoga involves visualization of deities, the passage emphasizes *how* they are worked with (through chakra activation and energy flow), not just praying to them.
*   **B: Bamtu mantras yi** (Reciting mantras) - Mantras are mentioned as a component *of* the practice, but not the core technique to unlock Kundalini.
*   **C: Jeema gis yàlla yi** (Worshipping gods) - Similar to A, this focuses on worship rather than the energetic practices.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, naka la ñuy taalee chakras yi ci waxtu “diggu” xalaatu Tibetain yi?","The correct answer is **A: Ci taxawaayu yoga yu wuute yi** (In the various wind horse yogas).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ak Kundalini Yoga, kàrtanu Kundlini (kàrtan gu u leeral) danu ko yeejare ko ci **taxawaayu yoga**, tàggatu nokki, mantras ak xool.""  This directly links the manipulation of Kundalini and working with chakras to *taxawaayu yoga*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci di jeema gis yàlla yi** (In the assembly of gods) - While Deity Yoga is mentioned, the passage doesn't say chakras are directly addressed *in* the assembly of gods. It says they are *utilized* within Deity Yoga (visualization of deities relating to chakras).
* **C: Bamtuwaatu mantras yi** (Through reciting mantras) - Mantras are *used with* taxawaayu yoga, but they aren’t the primary method for working with chakras described in the text.
* **D: Tagaatu ci nu ñuy nooyee** (By focusing on what we understand) - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the specific techniques described.



"
Kan moo jàng ñaareelu wëyu téereb diine bi ca programme ba?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The text states: ""Waykat bii di Sanju Sharma moo tàmbali soirée ba, teg ci Jai Shankar Choudhary."" This translates to ""The event was organized by Sanju Sharma, with the support of Jai Shankar Choudhary.""  This clearly indicates Sanju Sharma was the organizer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lakkha Singh:** Lakkha Singh performed bhajans and is associated with the Chhappan Bhog, but didn't organize the event.
* **C: Raju Khandelwal:** Raju Khandelwal also performed and helped with the event, but wasn't the organizer.
* **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** Jai Shankar Choudhary *supported* the event, but Sanju Sharma organized it.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo jàng ap wëyub diine ca waxtu mayeb lekk ba?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ci la Lakkha Singh tàmbali way bhajan yi. Amna 108 xeeti ñam yu Chhappan Bhog...yu ñu daan yakkal Baba Shyam."" This directly translates to ""Lakkha Singh performed many bhajans. There were 108 plates of Chhappan Bhog...offered to Baba Shyam.""  This indicates Lakkha Singh is the one leading the devotional offering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** The text says the soirée was *at* his place, he didn't lead the offering.
*   **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity being worshipped, not the person performing the offering.
*   **D: Sanju Sharma:** Sanju Sharma hosted a soirée, but isn't mentioned as leading the devotional offering.



"
Lan moo nekkoon ñaareelu performans bu mujj bu ngoon si?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina ak Haris Alexiou**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Diva bu Tirki Sezen Aksu woy na ak tenooru Itaali bi di Alessandro Safina ak woykatu gerek bi Haris Alexiou.""  This translates to ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek vocalist Haris Alexiou.""

The question asks who performed *with* the main spectacle. These three are explicitly named as collaborators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xalub Anatolie (Fire of Anatolia):** While mentioned, they performed a separate piece (""Troy"").
*   **C: Dervis turnër (Dervish Turné):** They were *on* the stage, but not described as performing *with* the main act.
*   **D: Fatih Erkoç ak Müslüm Gürses:** They were part of the orchestra, not specifically highlighted as performers alongside the main stars.



"
Ban nasionaalite la Alessandro Safina am?,"The correct answer is **D: Italien**.

The text states: ""tenooru Itaali bi di Alessandro Safina"" which translates to ""Italian tenor Alessandro Safina"". Therefore, he is Italian.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci baat yii moo dëgguwul?","The correct answer is **A: Lakk-lakk amoon na ca Santa Clara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bés bu tang la woon ci Santa Clara..."" (The beams were in Santa Clara...) This directly indicates that something happened/was found in Santa Clara.
* **The passage is about beams (jox) and their discovery.**  The entire text revolves around finding these beams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nit ñi tejuwoon nañu ci ay tundu Russe (People were helping them in Russian lands):** The passage doesn't mention Russia or Russian help.
* **C: Ña nekkoon ca woto wa joxoon nañu leen ndox (Those who dug the hole found their beams):** While digging is implied, the focus isn't *who* dug, but *where* the beams were found.
* **D: Jëloon na 60 simili ci lu neew ngir waccee kenn ca woto ba (It took 60 minutes to see anyone in the hole):** The passage doesn't mention any time duration related to seeing people in a hole.

Scott Kouns' quote discusses the history of fires in Santa Clara and the importance of fire prevention. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Seefu pompié bi** (The fire department).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dowalkat bi** (The hospital) - The passage doesn't mention a hospital.
* **C: Kilyaanu woto bi** (The church) - The passage doesn't mention a church.
* **D: Seefu poliis bi** (The police department) - While the police might be present at a fire, the primary responders described are firefighters.



"

The text states: ""Gissugnu ay yaxxu yaxxu wala ay gaañu gaañu yu mag ci Tonga, wayé kuran amul woon, artu woonna njiiti Tonga ci artuk jéyee ji bayyéko ci PTWC.""  This translates to ""There were strong earthquakes or large waves off Tonga, but the source was identified, and Tonga was put on alert by the PTWC."" This directly identifies Tonga as the origin of the tsunami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Niue:** Niue was *affected* by the tsunami, but not the source.
*   **C: Daara yi ca Hawaii:** Hawaii was warned about the tsunami, but it didn't originate there.
*   **D: Pago Pago:** Pago Pago was also *affected* by the tsunami, not the source.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, naka la paanu kurang bi laaleewoon Tonga?","The correct answer is **A: Amoon na ay yàqu-yàqu yu ñu ràññeewoon** (There were aftershocks).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gissugnu ay yaxxu yaxxu wala ay gaañu gaañu yu mag ci Tonga..."" which translates to ""There were strong aftershocks in Tonga...""
* **The question asks:** What happened after the initial event in Tonga?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  The passage doesn't mention waves impacting coastal areas.
* **C:** The passage mentions the sea level, but not specifically a rise in it.
* **D:** The passage doesn't indicate damage to infrastructure.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...benn yoon rekk bi polis fexee ba natt waxtu Mr Reid mooy bamu wàññi we ba 160km/h.""  This directly translates to ""only one speed the police confirmed at the time Mr. Reid was going at 160km/h.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba mu nekkeewoon ci juroom ñaareelu dowalam ca kaw pom bi** (They confirmed he was speeding on the bridge) - This is too general; the specific speed is the key information.
* **C: Ba mu nekkeewoon di dowal ci lu roopi 160km ci waxtu** (They confirmed he was driving approximately 160km at the time) - The text doesn't suggest an approximation, it's a confirmed speed.
* **D: Ba mu njëkkeewoon a nekk ci kaw pom bi** (They confirmed he was on the bridge) - This is irrelevant to *how fast* he was going.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu taxoon mu jafe ngir poliisu Nouvelle-Zélande koronometare gaawteeb Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Dafa doon dowal ci suufu 160kM ci waxtu** (He was driving at a speed of 160km/h at the time).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mr Reid jémna dawal daamar A1GP bu New Zealand, Black Beauty ci gaawayu 160km/h juroom gnaari yoon ci jallu kaay bi.""  This translates to ""Mr Reid drove the New Zealand A1GP car, Black Beauty, at a speed of 160km/h during the race on the bridge.""
* **The question asks:** What did the police's speedometer record for Jonny Reid?

The passage directly links Reid's speed to 160km/h, making option A the most accurate response.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Woto bi dafa yeexoon lool** (The car was very fast) - While true, it doesn't answer the specific question about the recorded speed.
* **C: Juroom ñaari yoon kesse la dowaloon ca kaw pom bi** (Many cars raced on the bridge) - This is a general statement not related to Reid's speed.
* **D: Pomu Auckland Harbour dafa màgget lool** (Auckland Harbour Bridge is very busy) - This is irrelevant to the question.



"
Fan la yëngëtu suuf si amoon jëm ci Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 mille bëj-saalum**.

The text states: ""...ak lu wara tollok 65 km (40 miles) ci sowwu Butte."" which translates to ""...and was 65 km (40 miles) south of Butte.""

Therefore, the earthquake was 40 miles south of Butte."
Lan moo jiboon ca xeex ba ca Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Mbugël gi jëm ci ñuñu téj**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states the case of Abu Ghraib is a painful one (""kasu Abu Ghraib bu Iraq taal nanu ko ba fa ab fippu amee"").**  This pain stems from what happened *to the people* there.
* **""Mbugël gi jëm ci ñuñu téj"" translates to ""Painful things happened to the people.""** This is a direct reflection of the passage's sentiment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap téj (It's true):** While the events *were* true, the question asks *what* about Abu Ghraib is problematic, not just if it happened.
* **C: Dooley US yi topatoo kaarange gi (US soldiers were wrongly accused):** The passage doesn't discuss accusations or blame, just the pain caused.
* **D: Lakkoon nañu kaso gi (The case is forgotten):**  The passage implies the opposite – it *remembers* the case and finds it painful.



"
Lu waraloon kaso Irak yi siiwoon? ,"The correct answer is **A: Dañu ko lakkoon** (It is true).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** directly states the case of Abu Ghraib in Iraq, and how it affected people. It mentions the suffering and how it led to resentment towards Americans.
* **Q (the question)** asks if the case of Iraq is true.
* **A (Dañu ko lakkoon)** confirms the truth of the case presented in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dooley US yi jël njiit li** (The US soldiers are not guilty) - The passage implies guilt and wrongdoing by US forces.
* **C: Amoon na ay xeex yu bare** (There are things that are not clear) - The passage is a direct statement about a known event.
* **D: Feeñinu mbugël gi jëm ci ñuñu téj** (People forget things over time) - The passage doesn't focus on forgetting, but on the lasting impact of the events.



"
Ban faanu xew la ñu waroon a defee ca Estadu Fattëliku Xare Maui ba?,"The correct answer is **C: Konser**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Band bi fomb xew xew biñu waroon amal ci Maui”s War Memorial Stadium..."" (The band performed a new show at Maui's War Memorial Stadium...) and describes a large attendance (9,000 people).
* This points to a **concert** (Konser) being held at the stadium, not a football game (Matsu Football), a wrestling match (Yëkkëtiku xaalis) or something else entirely (Wonale ñoongo - which doesn't make sense in context).

Therefore, the band was performing a concert at the stadium.



"
Kan ci dëgg moo xamle lu waral ñu dog xew li?,"The correct answer is **A: Bande bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Band bi fomb xew xew biñu waroon amal ci Maui’s War Memorial Stadium..."" (The band performed a new song at Maui's War Memorial Stadium...)
* The question asks what was new. The passage directly identifies the **band** and their new song as the new element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Këru njaatige bi (The management team)** - While mentioned, they aren't *new*; they are responsible for an event.
* **C: Ki moom Estadu Fattëliku Xare ga (The state stadium)** - The stadium itself isn't new.
* **D: Fans yi (The fans)** -  The fans aren't new; they are attendees.



"
Ku def ba ñu bare ñu dëkk Bishkek foog ni ñoo waraloon cacc bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñuy ñaxtu** (They are tourists).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Way-dëkk Bishkek yu bari japp nañu ne ñaxtukat yu joge ci bëj-saalum bi ño tax lu way nex def.""  This translates to: ""The good people of Bishkek say that they are tourists who come to rest and who often don't know where they are going.""

The question asks *why* people visit Bishkek. The passage directly identifies them as tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay takk-der yuy dëggërël Yoon wi** (They are all members of the Yoon family) - The passage doesn't mention anything about a family.
* **B: Ñu moom ay magasin** (They shop in stores) -  While they *might* shop, the passage doesn't focus on shopping as a reason for visiting.
* **D: Ndaw ñi** (Just like that) - This doesn't answer the question of *why* they are there.



"
Kan moo jiiñ ñaxtukat yi nekkoon ci bëj-saalumu sacc gi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñu dëkk ca Bishkek**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Way-dëkk Bishkek yu bari japp nañu ne ñaxtukat yu joge ci bëj-saalum bi ño tax lu way nex def."" This translates to ""The wealthy people of Bishkek say that the thieves are in the shadows, they say they are always there.""  This directly links the thieves to being *in* Bishkek.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay takk-der yuy dëggërël Yoon wi:** (Some of the Yoon government's supporters) - The passage doesn't mention any government or political affiliation.
* **C: Anarsist yi:** (Anarchists) - The passage doesn't discuss anarchists.
* **D: Dajaloowu nit ñi:** (Bad people) - While the ""thieves"" could be considered bad people, the passage specifically locates them *in Bishkek*.  Option A is a more direct answer to the question.



"
Kañ la Ring dundee ay njaay yu yokku?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba mu féeñee ca Shark Tank**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Siminoff wax na ne njaay yi dañoo yokku gannaaw ba mu feeñee ci 2013 ci benn episodu Shark Tank..."" This directly translates to ""...Siminoff said that many people didn't believe in him until he appeared on an episode of Shark Tank in 2013..."" This clearly indicates that being on Shark Tank was when Ring gained attention and people started believing in it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ba mu paree dajale xaalis ca àtum 2013** - While he *did* appear on Shark Tank in 2013, the passage doesn’t state he *sold* anything specifically in 2013.
*   **C: Apare ap feeñu ca QVC** -  His appearance on QVC was in 2017, *after* gaining attention.
*   **D: Ba mu paree lijënti ap prosé ak ADT** - The partnership with ADT came later, after he was already successful.



"
Kañ la Jamie Siminoff tannee tambali Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Ba mu xamee ni sonëri buntëm dafa jagadiwoon** (Because he noticed people were missing packages).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Defar na ab sonëri buntu buy doxee WIFI, ci limu wax."" which translates to ""There were a lot of stories about packages being stolen, he noticed."" This directly indicates he created Ring because he observed package theft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apare ap feeñu lajju barigo gaynde géej** (He didn't like having to go outside) - The text doesn't mention this as a motivation.
* **C: Ba mu jotee xaalisu finasma bi** (Because he wanted to improve finances) - While success brought financial gain, the text doesn't say this *motivated* the creation of Ring.
* **D: Apare ap ndam bu mu am ba mu feeñee ca QVC** (It had something to do with his appearance on QVC) - QVC was a result of Ring's success, not the reason for its creation.



"
Bepp episoodu jàng xon mayoon na gone yi ay digël ngir lan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ay téere** (Programs/Series).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly talks about programs like Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.** It discusses their importance in children's television and how John Grant worked to fund and support these *programs*.
* The question asks what the episodes are *for* the children. The passage indicates they are for educational purposes, delivered *through* the programs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wonale television** (Television generally) - Too broad. The passage focuses on specific *types* of television, not television as a whole.
* **B: Daaraay téere dëkk bi** (The station that broadcasts the program) -  While WNED Buffalo is mentioned, the question isn't about the station itself.
* **C: Tem** (Time) - The passage doesn't focus on scheduling or timing.



"
Lan moo am wall ci nu ñu dogee seri yu Jàngup Xon bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñàkkub ay kupu Emmy**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *Emission PBS bi sargal nañu ko lu ëpp fukki yoon ak ñaar ci prix Emmy* - which translates to ""PBS emissions were often associated with nominations and winning Emmy awards."" The question asks what we learn about John Grant's series. The passage directly links the series to Emmy awards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay finasma yu doyul** (Financial support) - While the passage mentions financing, it doesn’t state this is what we *learn* about the series.
*   **C: Xalaatu John Grant** (John Grant's talent) - The passage mentions John Grant's work but doesn't focus on his talent as the main takeaway about the series.
*   **D: Ndamup Koñub Goor Roger** (Roger Good Neighbor's impact) - This refers to *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, a different show mentioned for context, not John Grant's series.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkulwoon ap baat bu ñu am sas bi wax ci Amsterdam ak muse bi jëm ci garab gi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dina ci lu ñu mënuta moytu daanu**.

Here's why:

* **P** states the people were looking for a place to eat in Amsterdam near the Anne Frank House and found a place with mushrooms (sampiñon) and orange juice.  They wanted a place that felt welcoming and comfortable (""yarami nit ñi ne wax nañu ci yoonu daanu la nekk te lu wóoradi la"").
* **Q** asks what specifically led them to the place.
* **A** (""Dina ci lu ñu mënuta moytu daanu"" - ""Because they wanted something tasty"") directly relates to their desire for a welcoming and comfortable place, suggesting they were looking for good food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** (""Dañu koo wara sàmm"" - ""They were looking for shade"") is not mentioned in the text.
* **C:** (""Dañu ko waal ak sampiñon"" - ""They wanted it with mushrooms"") focuses only on one part of the meal and doesn't explain *why* they chose that place.
* **D:** (""Nekk na luy xeex wër gu yaramu mbooloo mi"" - ""It had a very nice and comfortable atmosphere"") while true, doesn't answer *what led them to find* that place - it describes the place itself.



"
"Sukkëndiku ci ap seef inspektër ngir RSPCA, seetlu yi dañoo wara yem ngir ban ci yii toop?","The correct answer is **B: Kepp kuy liggéey ak mala yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the RSPCA is using CCTV footage to help with cases of animal cruelty. Inspector David O'Shannessy specifically says CCTV ""helps to prosecute people who mistreat animals.""  This directly links the CCTV to *catching* people mistreating animals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kamera CCTV:** While true, it's too broad. The question asks what the *inspector* is using it *for*.
*   **C: Palaasé ay kamera yuy seetluwaate:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Réyukaay yi:** The CCTV helps with cases *about* animals, but it's not what the inspector is directly using it *for*.

* **The passage directly states:** ""ñoo ngi laajal ñu sampalaat leen ay kamera de surveillance CCTV ci barabi reyukaayu mala yu nekk ci Ostaraali yépp."" (they installed CCTV surveillance cameras in the homes of animals in Australia).  This highlights the use of CCTV as a key action.
* **The passage explains** that the RSPCA is using these cameras to monitor animal welfare and deter mistreatment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay ndaje yu war ak RSPCA** (People who work with RSPCA) - While RSPCA workers are involved, the *action* being discussed isn't simply *who* works there, but *what* they are doing.
* **C: Di inspekte saa su nekk réy yi** (The inspector who is in the homes) - David O'Shannessy is mentioned, but he's giving information *about* the cameras, not the main point of the passage.
* **D: Topptoo bu rëy joge ci ABC** (News reported on ABC) - The ABC is just where the information was *reported*, not the action improving animal welfare.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan mooy liggéeyu nit ku ñu jàppoon?","The correct answer is **C: Njiitu xeet**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Doonte, ab surs xam xam ci ceytu gi wax na Minneapolis Star – Tribune nee na Louis Jordan, doomu Floyd Jourdain **Njiitu xeetu Red Lake** bu am fukki at ak juróom benn la.""  This directly identifies Floyd Jourdain as a Red Lake school member (Njiitu xeet).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndongo daara:** While the event *involved* a school shooting, the question asks *who* the passage identifies as being connected to it.
* **B: Ap taskatu xebaar bu Minneapolis Star-Tribune:** Louis Jordan is a reporter *for* the paper, not someone directly involved in the event.
* **D: Ap nitu sañ-sañ ci Déeg bu Xonk bi:** The passage doesn't focus on victims, but on people connected to the Red Lake school.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ba xebaar yi doon wal jëm ci beneen japp, ñaata neew la ñu doom suul?","The correct answer is **B: Ñeet**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njiit yi wax nañ tuuti ginaw bi ñu dëgalee jàppu tay bi."" This translates to ""The students said they were scared of what would happen next.""  This directly indicates they *were* scared, meaning ""yes"" or ""Ñeet"" is the correct response to the question ""Were the students scared?"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Benn:** Means ""good"" or ""yes"" in a positive affirmation, not answering if they were scared.
*   **C: Juroom ñeent:** Means ""many no"", doesn't relate to the question.
*   **D: Ñeent:** Means ""no""."
"Ngir tuntu ñaxtu bi, ban réew moo jëfeewul ak mandargaalu sartu diggënte ACTA?","The correct answer is **B: Pologne**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Weer wi weesu nit ñaa ngi doon ñaxtu bu baax ci réewum Pologne ginaaw bi mu xaatimee ACTA bi, looloo waral nguuru pologne ni fii ñu tollu nii mënul dëggal xaatim bi mu xas ba def."" 

This translates to: ""The event caused many people in Poland to protest when it ratified ACTA, especially Polish citizens who strongly opposed the ratification and tried to prevent it from being finalized.""  This clearly indicates Poland had significant opposition and protest related to ACTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Almaañ (Germany):** While the text mentions cities in Germany, it doesn't say Germany *opposed* ACTA.
*   **C: Ecosse (Scotland):** The text mentions cities in Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow) but doesn't state opposition to ACTA.
*   **D: Lituanie (Lithuania):** The text mentions Vilnius in Lithuania, but doesn’t indicate significant opposition to ACTA.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii réew yu toop ñoo tànnoon soril tërëlinu bokk ci ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Lettonie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Latvia ak Slovakia bayyi nañu mbiri jokku ci ACTA."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia both opposed ACTA.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Estonie:** The text mentions Tallinn (Estonia) as a city where protests took place, but doesn't say Estonia opposed ACTA.
*   **B: Lituanie:** The text mentions Vilnius (Lithuania) as a city where protests took place, but doesn't say Lithuania opposed ACTA.
*   **C: Ecosse:** The text mentions Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland) as cities where protests took place, but doesn't say Scotland opposed ACTA.



"
Ñaata nit la tangooru iPod bu ëp gaañ?,"The correct answer is **D: 34**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ayu-bis bii ñu génn, METI xamle na ni Apple xamle woon na ko ci yeneen **34** xew-xewi tangaay yuñ ci dolli..."" 

This translates to: ""According to reports, METI understands that Apple has sold approximately **34** thousand units in total...""  This refers to the number of iPods sold.

Therefore, the answer is 34."
Ku wax ni tangoor yu ëp yi metiwu ñu woon lool?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""METI xamle na ni Apple xamle woon na ko ci yeneen 34 xew-xewi tangaay yuñ ci dolli, bi këru-liggéeyukaay bi di woowee “ñaka seriyë.”""  This translates to ""METI believes that Apple knew about 34 defects in the product, with the quality control being called 'serial defects'.""

This clearly indicates that Apple is the one believed to have known about the problems with the products (the iPods). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: METI:** METI is the *investigating* ministry, not the one with the defective products.
*   **B: Ñu moom iPOD te rax ci:** This translates to ""Those who sell iPods"". This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint the source of the problem.
*   **C: Liggéeyukaay miy topatoo lakk lakk ci Japon:** This translates to ""Quality control that is very bad in Japan."" While the passage mentions quality control, it doesn't say it's generally bad in Japan, but specifically related to Apple's products.



"
"Ba muy joxe bataaxalam, lan la Steve Jobs waxoon ni Apple moom la doon sàkkaat?","The correct answer is **D: Teknolosi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** discusses Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone, a product of **technology**.  His quote (""Apple has redefined mobile phones, and they are more amazing than ever"") directly relates to technological advancement.
* **The question (Q)** asks what field Steve Jobs was talking about when he said Apple was doing something significant.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taariix (History)** - While the event *is* history, the *topic* of the conversation isn't history itself.
* **B: Telefon (Telephone)** -  He's talking about *redefining* phones, not just phones themselves. The focus is on the innovation.
* **C: Kërub liggéeyukaay (Daily life)** -  It impacts daily life, but the core subject is the technological aspect.



Therefore, **Teknolosi (Technology)** is the most accurate answer."
Lan moo nekkoon jublukaayu ñaari waxtu bataaxal yu Steve Jobs?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngir génnee ap telefon bu bees** (To create a very good phone).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states Steve Jobs' vision was to create a portable and easy-to-use phone:**  ""...teey Apple dina coppi waat portaabal, tey dañuy bindaat mboor’’, which translates to ""they Apple wanted a portable and very easy copy.""  This refers to the iPhone.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ngir génnee ap alluwa bu bees** (To create a very good light) - Doesn't align with the iPhone's purpose.
    * **B: Ngir génnee ap ordinatër bu bees** (To create a very good computer) - While Apple makes computers, the passage specifically discusses the iPhone.
    * **D: Ngir xamle retretam** (To learn retirement) - Completely irrelevant to Steve Jobs' work.



"
Lan la Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner yegle ca teataru Argentine?,"The correct answer is **A: Kandidaturam ca presidensiel ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mrs. Kirchner waxna meebeetam ci doon njiitu Argentine Theatre, bénn beereeb bi mu tamm di door tukkém ci atuk 2005 ngir Senate ngir bokk ci mbootayu Buenos Aires.""  This translates to ""Mrs. Kirchner announced her candidacy in front of the Argentine Theatre, before starting her campaign in 2005 for the Senate to represent the province of Buenos Aires.""

Therefore, she used the Argentine Theatre to **announce her presidential candidacy**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bëgg bëggam ci jongante ngir palaasu Senat bi** (Negotiating for a seat in the Senate palace) - The text says she *ran* for Senate, not negotiated for a seat.
* **C: Kampañam ngir delegasion wu diwaanu Buenos Aires** (Campaigning for a delegation in the city of Buenos Aires) - She campaigned to *represent* Buenos Aires in the Senate, not for a delegation *within* the city.
* **D: Palangam mi di wacc ci bangu senatër bu mu nekk nii** (Speaking to a group of senators who were there) - The text focuses on *her* announcement, not a speech *to* senators.



"
Fan la Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner yegle bëgg bëggamu jongante?,"The correct answer is **C: Ca teatar Argentain bi sori Buenos Aires ci 31 mille**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mrs. Kirchner waxna meebeetam ci doon njiitu Argentine Theatre, bénn beereeb bi mu tamm di door tukkém ci atuk 2005 ngir Senate ngir bokk ci mbootayu Buenos Aires.""  This translates to: ""Mrs. Kirchner first appeared in a performance at the Argentine Theatre, before being elected in 2005 as Senator for the province of Buenos Aires.""
* **""sori Buenos Aires""** means ""near Buenos Aires"".
* **""31 mille""** refers to 31 kilometers (approximately 31 miles, as the passage mentions La Plata is 50 kilometers from Buenos Aires).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage specifically mentions the *Argentine Theatre*, not just ""a theatre"" in La Plata.
* **B:** The Argentine Theatre is near Buenos Aires, not *in* La Plata.
* **D:** The passage states she appeared at the Argentine Theatre *before* becoming a Senator for Buenos Aires, not that the theatre *is* in Buenos Aires.



"
Lan moo nekkoon lu ACMA gis jëmële ko ci Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **B: Gis nañu ni dañu nëboon ay mbirup media jëm ci sitwebu Big Brother.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ACMA is concerned about content on the internet, specifically things that are harmful and accessible to children. It also mentions the Broadcasting Service Act applies to internet content originating from servers.
* **The question (Q) asks:** How might ACMA intervene with Big Brother (presumably a website hosting content)?
* **Option B** directly addresses this concern. ACMA would be interested if Big Brother *hosted* media content (images, videos) on its website. This is directly related to the passage's focus on content and servers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A & C:** Focus on *viewing* the films, not the *hosting* of the films. ACMA is concerned with where the content *comes from*, not just people watching it.
* **D:**  Talks about finding content ""on a server,"" but doesn't connect it to Big Brother as the *source* of that content.  The passage is about regulating *providers* of content.



"
Ci yan parameetar la media wara jeebëlu ngir ñu mën leen a jappe ni lu ñu mëna def ci internet?,"The correct answer is **B: Dafa wara nekk ci jëm ci ap servër**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...warna nékk ci server bi."" (meaning it originates on a server).  The question asks where the media *is* for the purpose of being accessed online.  Originating on a server is the key.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañu ko wara wone ci internet bi:** While the media ends up *on* the internet, the passage doesn't say that's where it's *stored* or *exists* for access.
* **C: Kenn mënu koo denc ci ap siteweb:** A website is a *way to access* the media, not where it fundamentally resides.
* **D: ACMA daf ko wara nangu:** ACMA regulates, it doesn't *store* the media.

Kan mooy njiitu Parti Liberal bu Australie?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Peter Costello, nekk trésorier di doomu australie lañu gëna am yaakaar ni mooy wuutu Premier ministre John Howard ci boppu Parti libéral...""  This directly identifies John Howard as being from the Liberal Party and as the Prime Minister.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Peter Costello:** While mentioned in the text, he is described as *under* John Howard, not the leader.
*   **C: John Kerr:** Not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Malcolm Fraser:** Not mentioned in the text.



"
Lu waral Australie amagul ap këru liggéeyu kàttanu nukléer?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñàkk ndimbëlu mbooloo mi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Peter Costello (former treasurer) said Australia doesn't have the resources to develop nuclear power.** He believes it would be too expensive.
* **""Ñàkk ndimbëlu mbooloo mi""** translates to ""No, absolutely not"" or ""Not at all,"" reflecting Costello's negative stance on Australia pursuing nuclear power due to lack of resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Day indi coow:**  Means ""It's a good idea,"" which is the opposite of Costello's view.
* **C: Fitna lay indi:** Means ""Maybe it's a good idea,"" which is not what the passage conveys – Costello is quite firm in his opposition.
* **D: Dafa seer lool:** Means ""It's very important,"" which isn't the main point of his statement.  He's focused on *feasibility* (resources) not *importance*.



"
Ban eskikat moo jongantewoon ak ndimbëlu ap teetekat?,"The correct answer is **A: Anna Jochemsen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anna Jochemsen bi jël juróom ñeeteelu palaas ci joŋante Super-G ci jigéen ñi démb..."" which translates to ""Anna Jochemsen won third place in the Super-G competition in the women's event..."" 

Therefore, Anna Jochemsen is the skier who competed and achieved a ranking in the competition. The other options either had different rankings or competed in different events/genders.



"
Ban réew moo mujjee nekk ci bërëpu fukk ca Super-G ngir kalaasu taxawaayu jigéen ñi?,"The correct answer is **B: Pays Bas**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Réew yooyu ñooy Pays-Bas, Anna Jochemsen bi jël juróom ñeeteelu palaas ci joŋante Super-G ci jigéen ñi démb...""  This translates to ""One of the countries is the Netherlands, Anna Jochemsen finished in third place in the Super-G in the women's event...""

The question asks which country participated in the Super-G competition. While several countries are mentioned, the Netherlands is specifically highlighted as a participating country with a named athlete and a result.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban baat jëm ci Blake moo dëgguwul?","The correct answer is **D: Dafa ni dañu ko doon sandi ay buteel**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...neena li mu doon doye poteau bi mooy aar buteel yi ko ay ndaw doon sànni, ñu tollu ci fanweeri ndaw.""  This translates to ""...the reason he was given the post was that there were several bottles he had thrown, scattering them on the floor."" 

This directly indicates Blake was accused of throwing bottles. The question asks what Blake was accused of, and throwing bottles is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ca bërëp ba la ñu ko jappeewoon** (Because of the appearance they gave him) - The passage doesn't mention anything about his appearance being the reason for the accusation.
*   **B: Dafa nangu soong bi** (He spoke badly) - The passage doesn't mention anything about Blake's speech.
*   **C: Dafa jëfëndikoo ap bant ca waxtu soong ma** (He defended himself against the bad words) - The passage doesn't state he defended himself.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii moo dalulwoon Blake?","The correct answer is **D: Dañu ko waxoon ni mën na am ñu tej ko kaso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Atekat bi wax na Blake “lu mënul woon ñakk la” dafay dem kaso.""  This translates to ""The judge said to Blake 'you are lucky some people didn't pursue the case'.""  This directly indicates that people *could* have taken legal action against Blake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: àttee nañu ko ni ku wëlbëti njubte** (They didn't care about him) - The passage doesn't say they didn't care. It says they *could* have sued.
* **B: Dañu ko jappoon** (They ignored him) -  Again, the passage doesn't state they ignored him.
* **C: Dañu ko soong ak ap bant** (They threatened him with violence) - There's no mention of violence in the text.



"
Fan la ñuy dugal xaalis bi U.N jagleel tàngooru jawwu? ,"The correct answer is **C: Kër yu ci dëgg dañoo sanku ci ndox** (Houses that are damaged and need repair).

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Mën nañu yobbu xaalis bi ci kër yi mbënd mi laal, cig saytug dox bi gën ak bariwaayu mbay mi."" This translates to ""They are giving the aid to damaged houses, especially those with many inhabitants.""
* **Q asks:** What is the U.N. aid focused on in West Africa?

Therefore, the aid is focused on repairing damaged houses, making **C** the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di wuuteel goob gi** (It's about the quality of the soil) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **B: Yoobu teknolosi ca réew yuy magg yi** (Technology help for the least developed countries) - While technology *could* be involved in aid, the text specifically mentions houses.
* **D: Wàññi loraange ci tàngooru jawwu ju jéggi dayo mëna jur** (Orange cultivation in West Africa to greatly improve nutrition) - This is completely unrelated to the text.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la U.N yaakaar a texeel?","The correct answer is **A: Xaalis, jare ko ci seedële teknolosi** (Translation: Funds, specifically for technological development).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Mbootaayu Xeet yi (ONU) bi yaakar na paré benn xaalis ngir dimbali dëkk yu sonn ci tàngooru jawwu ji ngir ñu mën ko dékku."" (The United Nations is working to provide funds for the development of settlements in low-lying coastal areas to help them cope.)
* **The passage continues:** ""...cig saytug dox bi gën ak bariwaayu mbay mi."" (...especially with technological support).

This directly connects the UN's work with providing **funds specifically for technological development** to help these vulnerable areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Goob yi (Lands):** While the settlements *are* on land, the passage focuses on *funding* and *technology*, not just the land itself.
* **C: Àll tropikal yu dess (Dry tropical forests):** The passage discusses coastal areas, not forests.
* **D: Nit yu ñàkk topatoo ndox mi nu mu waree laal (People who are often poor and who are highly vulnerable):** While the people in these areas *are* vulnerable, the question asks what the UN is *doing* – providing funds, not just acknowledging the vulnerability.



"
Ban ci yii toop la Albert Muchanga limulwoon ni lenn lu soxlawoon ñu nangu ko?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndax Benin dafa waroon na bokk ci AfCTA**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Saytukatu komkom ak njënd ak njay bu AU Albert Muchanga waxnani Benin bokk na."" (The statement comes from AU official Albert Muchanga who announced that Benin is ready.)
* **The passage continues:** ""...“deggoo wa gñu ci nimu sàrtu cosaan bi ak njëgi dêkkuwaay yi, waaye kaadar biñu am doyna ngir ñu tambalee jaay 1 fan ci Sulet 2020”."" This reinforces Benin's readiness to participate in AfCFTA.

The question asks what Albert Muchanga announced. He announced Benin's readiness to join AfCFTA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bës bu njaay mi waree tambali** -  The passage doesn't focus on the benefits of trade, just Benin's readiness.
* **C: Ay sartu cosaan** -  ""Ay sartu cosaan"" (important costs) is mentioned in the quote, but isn't the *main* point of Muchanga's announcement.
* **D: Wàññi njeg yi** - (State negotiations) This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lu tax njaay mëna tambali ci sulet?","The correct answer is **A: Tambali ci ap bësup sulet moo bokkoon ci lu Nigeria doon laaj ngir mëna bokk ci AfCFTA.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kaadar biñu am doyna ngir ñu tambalee jaay 1 fan ci Sulet 2020"" (they don't have the capacity to implement it by January 1st, 2020). This directly relates to the difficulty in *implementing* (tambali) the AfCFTA.
* **The question asks:** What is the issue with implementing by January?
* **Option A** accurately reflects this challenge - the implementation is hindered because Nigeria wasn't ready.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Talks about standards and interests, which are related to AfCFTA but not the *specific* reason for the delay in implementation.
* **C:** Mentions the AU Commissioner, but doesn't explain the problem with the January deadline.
* **D:** Discusses goods and negotiations, again, relevant to AfCFTA but not the core issue of Nigeria's readiness.

This translates to: ""The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's constitution began to reveal that some scores were altered on tests. The report found that changes were made to the raw scores and that the school officials wanted to manipulate what we see.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sopi rapooru Journal-Constitution bi** - The passage discusses *what* the report revealed, not just that a report existed.
* **B: Laaj ci di yeesalaat njàng mi** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Wone pong yu neew yu am ci test bi** - While altered scores are mentioned, the Journal-Constitution's focus was on *how* and *why* they were altered (manipulation by officials).



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bu ñu joxe ci lu ñu wax, lan la ñu waxulwoon ca Atlanta Journal-Constitution bi?","The correct answer is **A: Ay pong yu ñu mësutawoon a am yuy wone seen jëm kanam** (Points that they investigated to have their own interests).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Konstitisiyon wu Surnaalu Atlanta buñu siiwal na ab néttali buy wone ay jafe-jafe li tukkee ci test yi."" This translates to ""The Constitution of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found evidence that they altered tests for their own benefit.""  This directly indicates the investigation revealed self-serving actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Luy firndeel ni test yi dañu leen sopiwoon** (They found that the tests helped them) - While the tests *did* help them, the passage focuses on the *investigation* and the *altering* of the tests, not simply the outcome.
* **C: Ku jël ndam li ndaam intendent bu magg bi ci àtum 2013** (To elect the best superintendent in 2013) -  The passage mentions the 34 Hall County officials, but their involvement isn’t about electing a superintendent; it's about being investigated.
* **D: Ay xalaat ngir yeesal njàng mi ci dëkk mi** (Mistakes to improve school in the city) - The passage describes wrongdoing and cheating, not mistakes made in good faith to improve schools.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban xebaar la ñu xam ni moo toop bombardement bi?","The correct answer is **A: Limu gaañu gaañu yi yëpp**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Yénééni gnétti ndéll kalaté nangu ci wétu beereebu njiit yi ci gnaari waxtu."" This translates to ""They only knew about the plane when it was already bombing their village.""  This indicates they *didn't* know beforehand.
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""After it happened, did they understand it was a bombing?""  The passage implies they realized *after* the bombing was happening.
* **Option A (""Limu gaañu gaañu yi yëpp"" - ""Only later did they understand"")** directly reflects this realization *after* the event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci wetu yan tabax la bomb yi takkee (""It was when it started falling that they knew about the bombs"")** - This suggests they knew *as* the bombs fell, not after.
* **C: Bu dee ni dañu waroon a takkal yeneeni bomb (""It's because they didn't expect it that they didn't know about the bombs"")** -  While true, it doesn't answer *when* they understood.
* **D: Bilaan bu mujj buy wone ñu dee ñi (""A lot of them didn't even know"")** - The passage doesn't focus on how many knew, but *when* they understood.



"
"Ba mu bokkee ci Manchester City ci 2017, ñaata mats la Jesus suwéwoon?","The passage states: ""Jesus mi am ñaar fukki at ak benn dem na Manchester City at mii weesu ci 2017 jóge ci këlëbu Breresii Palmeiras ngir xaalis gu toll ci **27 miliyong £**.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 27**.  The passage directly states the transfer fee was 27 million £.



"
Ban klub la Jesus jote £27 miliongu njëg ci bokk kesse?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jesus mi am ñaar fukki at ak benn dem na Manchester City at mii weesu ci 2017 jóge ci këlëbu Breresii **Palmeiras** ngir xaalis gu toll ci 27 miliyong £.""  This translates to ""Jesus joined Manchester City and was previously in 2017 at Brazilian club **Palmeiras** for a fee of 27 million £.""

Therefore, Palmeiras is the club that Jesus joined *from* for £27 million."
Ban baat jëm ci inwité yi ci obers bi moo dëgguwul?,"The correct answer is **C: Inwite yi ñungi fa woon ngir ngoonug hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Benn auberge moo daanu ca Makka...dëkk bu séll bu Lislaam bi ay boru 10 waxtu ci suba ci waxtu dëkk bi."" (This hotel is in Mecca, a holy place of Islam, and is close to the mosque for about 10 minutes.) and ""Amna gën gaa néew 15 nit ñu ci faatu, ñoo ngi ragal lim boobu yokk."" (There are now 15 people arriving daily, and they are all eager.)
* This strongly implies the hotel caters to pilgrims going for Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca.  ""Ngoonug hajj"" translates to ""Hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inwite yi ñanga woon Mecque ngir ap pelerinas:** While they *are* going to Mecca, the passage doesn't specifically say they are pilgrims (""ap pelerinas"" - pilgrims) generally, but rather are focused on Hajj.
* **B: Yenn inwite yi nekku ñu woon nitu dëkk bi:** This is too general. The passage doesn't focus on the hotel's residents as a whole, but their purpose for being there.
* **D: Ñu bare ci inwite te yi ca dëkk bu sell ba la ñu jogeewoon:** This is irrelevant to the context of the passage. It talks about where the hotel is, not about how people are invited.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii baat mooy dëgg?","The correct answer is **C: Inwite yi ñungi woon foofu ngir ngoonub pelerinasu hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amna gën gaa néew 15 nit ñu ci faatu, ñoo ngi ragal lim boobu yokk."" (Amna has brought 15 people with her, and they are all preparing to go on Hajj.)
* **Hajj is a pilgrimage to Mecca.** The text describes an inn (auberge) in Mecca and mentions its proximity to the holy sites.
* **Option C directly relates to this:** ""Inwite yi ñungi woon foofu ngir ngoonub pelerinasu hajj"" translates to ""The guests are preparing to perform the Hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amulwoon benn mbugël:** (They are building a hotel) - While the passage mentions construction, it doesn't state the *purpose* of the construction is a hotel.
* **B: Inwite yi yëpp Emirats Arabes Unis la ñu jogeewoon:** (The guests are from the United Arab Emirates) - The passage states the *company* is from the UAE, but not necessarily the guests.
* **D: Ñu bare ci inwité yi ci dëkkub Mecque la ñu dëkkoon:** (They are taking the guests to the Mecca inn to stay) -  This is a description of what *happens*, but doesn't explain the *reason* for the guests being there.

"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban xebaar jëm ci kalash bi moo dul lu woorul?","The correct answer is **C: Jëfi kalash bi ci kaw suuf si**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mbëkanté ci 491 miles ci kaw suuf"" (occurred 491 miles from the coast).  This directly relates to the location of the crash.
* **The question asks:** Where did the plane crash relative to the shore?
* **Option C** translates to ""The plane crashed near the coast"", which aligns perfectly with the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ni kalash bi tool** - ""If the plane is full"" - irrelevant to the location.
* **B: Bërëpu kalash bi** - ""The plane's color"" - irrelevant.
* **D: Bërëpu toj toj yi** - ""The plane's tires"" - irrelevant.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo soxla ñu maas ko ba tey jëm ci kalash bi?","The correct answer is **D: Nu rëyaayu musiba bi tool**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes an accident/disaster.** It talks about an explosion, potential damage, and an investigation. The phrase ""musiba bi tool"" (the disaster occurred) directly reflects this.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Kan mooy topatoo di wër fu toj toj yi nekk** - This translates to ""It is simply a matter of fixing the trains,"" which doesn't capture the seriousness of an explosion and investigation.
    * **B: Naka ci gaawaay la satelit yi doon tukkee ca waxtu kalash bi** - This means ""It is due to the fact that satellites recorded at the time of the accident,"" while satellites *might* be used in the investigation, it's not the core reason for what happened.
    * **C: Naka la ñuy seddoowee lu juddoo ci seggup nataal yi** -  This translates to ""It is because they exceeded the speed limits,"" while speed *could* be a contributing factor, the passage focuses on an explosion, not just speeding.



**In summary:** The passage is about an accident, and option D directly states that the accident occurred."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban palaas la Batten benn yoon teye ci listu Americain yu gëna am alal?","The correct answer is **A: 400**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Batten lañu teggoon ci **190eelu palaas** ci limu **400** Amerikee yi ëpp alal...""  This translates to ""Batten is ranked among the **190th wealthiest** on the list of **400** Americans...""

Therefore, Batten is on the list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.



"
Ban ci yii la Batten joxe ap maye?,"The correct answer is **A: Listu Americain yu gëna am alal**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Batten lañu teggoon ci 190eelu palaas ci limu 400 Amerikee yi ëpp alal..."" (Batten was among the 400 richest Americans...). This directly identifies him as a wealthy American businessman.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Université bu Virginie:** While he *attended* the University of Virginia, the question asks what Batten *is*, not where he went to school.
* **C: Ap arafu daara bu am solo:** The text doesn't give information about his personal character.
* **D: Daara bu ñu jagleel mbirum aar yi ak siens yi:**  The text only says he studied at college, not specifically about an interest in art or science.



"
Lan moo bokkul ci sart bu Guvernër Arnold Schwarzenegger siñé?,"The correct answer is **A: Ap aaye ci njaayub walla luwaasu së video yu bon yi ñii di ay gone ci biir Californie yëpp.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Arnold Schwarzenegger is linked to videos showing him interacting with women, and these videos took place in California.  It mentions a potential legal issue (the $1000 fee) related to these videos.
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""It concerns discussions or investigations about good videos that had incidents in California."" (""Ap aaye ci njaayub walla luwaasu së video yu bon yi ñii di ay gone ci biir Californie yëpp."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Di wërël xaalis ñii di def ay ñaawteef:** This translates to ""It is a scandal that revealed some truths."" While the situation *could* be a scandal, the passage doesn't specifically focus on the revelation of truths, but the existence of the videos and potential consequences.
* **C: Ap aaye ci njaayub walla luwaasu së video yu bon yi gone yu nekk ca biti Californie:** This translates to ""It concerns discussions or investigations about good videos that happened in the city of California."" The passage says California generally, not specifically a city *within* California.
* **D: Ap wareefu yoobu ay nataal yu am melo ci lu ko mëna teye ci së video yu bon yi:** This translates to ""It involves people with interests who are involved in the good videos."" This is too vague and doesn't accurately represent the core issue described in the passage.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo ñàkk mbir yu ñu doon wax?","The correct answer is **B: Mike**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Mike dafay wax lu bari suñu koy deglu ci àtte bi... Dama doon waajlu moo tax dégguma bu baax limu doon wax."""" This directly translates to ""Mike said a lot of things he shouldn't have said at the meeting... They want to know what he really meant.""

The question asks *who* is the subject of what they are trying to understand. The passage clearly focuses on understanding *Mike's* words and intentions.
"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop moo dëggu ci jaar jaaru Miller ca odiens ba?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall laal Miller ca waxtu odiens ba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bi ñu joxee kàddu gi Miller, dafa wax ni: """"Mike dafay wax lu bari suñu koy deglu ci àtte bi... Dama doon waajlu moo tax dégguma bu baax limu doon wax.""""""  This translates to: ""When they asked Miller about the matter, he said: 'Mike said many things he shouldn't have said in public... He wanted to make a good impression on the audience.'""
* **This directly implies** Duvall (Mike) was trying to impress the audience.  ""Laal"" means ""to please"" or ""to try to impress.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nekkulwoon di degglu ca waxtu bu mu doon waaj:** This translates to ""He wanted to be well-received at the time he wanted to succeed."" While he *wanted* to succeed, the passage focuses on the *impression* he wanted to make, not just general success.
* **C: Ñaari doomu Duvall yi wax nañu lu bare ca waxtu odiens ba:** This translates to ""The things Duvall said were many things at the time of the audience."" This is too general and doesn't pinpoint the *intention* behind his words.
* **D: Mungi doon degglu bu baax taariixu Duvall:** This translates to ""He wanted to make a good history for Duvall."" This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Kan moo diggle ñu gëstuwaat sart bu ñu teg jëmële ko ci baaxaayu ngelaw gu ñuy nooyi?,"The correct answer is **A: John Howard**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njiitu jëwriñ yi John Howrd wax na ne jëf ji ngir sàmm tabax yi nekk ci bërëbu fajukaay yi ba bu leen nguuru Tasmani yàkk di joxe ab AUD bu ykku ci 45 miliyong dolaaru wa Amerig."" This directly translates to ""Former Prime Minister John Howard said he campaigned for funding for forestry in Tasmania, which cost approximately AUD 45 million.""

The question asks who *campaigned* for funding.  The passage specifically names John Howard as the one who did the campaigning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Parti Conservatër bi** - While the passage mentions the Conservative party, it doesn't say they were the ones campaigning for the funds.
*   **C: Jack Lauton** - Jack Layton is mentioned as opposing the legislation, not campaigning for funds.
*   **D: Stephen Harper** - Stephen Harper is mentioned in relation to the ""Clean Air Act"" but not this specific funding campaign.



"
Kan moo bañoon ni sart giy gëstu baaxaayu ngelaw gi dañu ko doon jëfëndikoo ni ap kuu pre-electoral?,"The correct answer is **B: Ap premié ministar**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses Stephen Harper (a Prime Minister) and Jack Layton (leader of the NDP) engaging in actions *specifically* related to an upcoming election (""pre-electoral"").  The text details how they used the ""Clean Air Act"" and negotiations around a copper mine to try and gain political advantage.  The question asks what role the people in the passage were playing to gain political advantage.  Prime Ministers (and their parties) are the ones who typically make these kinds of strategic moves leading up to an election.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fonksioneeru nguuru réew mi (Government functionary):** While many people within the government would be *involved* in these actions, the passage focuses on the *leaders* making decisions.
*   **C: Ap njiitu NDP (NDP member):** Jack Layton *is* mentioned, but the question is about who is generally trying to gain advantage, and Harper is equally (if not more) prominent in this behavior.
*   **D: Ap depute federal (Federal deputy):** Deputies are part of the process, but aren't the ones making the overarching, pre-election strategies.



"
Lan la booleep asid sianurik ak melamine defar ba ñu tontoo ci seen biir ci ap sowu muus?,"The correct answer is **C: Ay kristaal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gëstukat yi seetlu nañu ay xeer (cristaux) ci sawu muus ginaaw bi ñu ci yokkee mélamine ak acide cyanurique.""  This translates to: ""The samples contained crystals in the fine powder which were identified as melamine and cyanuric acid.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Riin yi (The resins)** - The passage doesn't focus on resins, but on the *components* found *within* a powder.
* **B: Lekkub malab kër (Household cleaning products)** - While the context implies a safety concern (food contamination), the passage doesn't directly mention cleaning products.
* **D: Sprektroskopi infraruj (Infrared spectroscopy)** - Spectroscopy (FTIR) is a *method used to identify* the substances, not the substances themselves.



"
Lan la seetkat yi jëfëndikoowee sprektroskopi infraruj ngir seetlu ko?,"The correct answer is **D: Lekku mala yu ñu waal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gëstukat yi seetlu nañu ay xeer (cristaux) ci sawu muus ginaaw bi ñu ci yokkee mélamine ak acide cyanurique.""  This translates to ""The samples were found to contain crystals in a white powder which were identified as melamine and cyanuric acid.""
* **The question asks:** What were the samples found to contain, according to spectroscopy?
* **""Lekku mala yu ñu waal""** translates to ""White powder containing melamine,"" which directly reflects the finding described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nu riin yi di doxee:** (They are looking at them) - This doesn't answer *what* they found.
* **B: Nu kristaal yi defaro ci sowup ap mala:** (The crystals are different in white powder) - This doesn't specify *what* the crystals are.
* **C: Mala yu ñu waal:** (Melamine powder) - While melamine *is* present, the passage also mentions cyanuric acid.  This isn't a complete answer.



"
Kan moo woowee Luna ni ap “Lingéer bu sës”?,"The correct answer is **A: Dustin Runnels**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels wax na ni """"Luna doyonna war ni man…xeeyna sax luko ëpp…bëgg naa ko dina ko namm…fookni mongi ci bërëb bu dàq."""""". This translates to Dustin Runnels calling Luna something – implying he's the one who gave her a nickname. The question asks who called Luna ""Lingéer bu sës"" (Queen of Evil), and the text points to Dustin Runnels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Xinhua:** Xinhua is mentioned at the beginning of the text but has no connection to naming Luna.
*   **C: Njaatige Luna:** This refers to Luna herself, not someone who would *name* her.
*   **D: Tommy Dreamer:** Tommy Dreamer simply talks *about* Luna's legacy, he doesn't assign her a nickname in the provided text.



"
Kan moo woowee Luna ku bizaar?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dustin """"Goldust"""" Runnels wax na ni """"Luna doyonna war ni man…xeeyna sax luko ëpp…bëgg naa ko dina ko namm…fookni mongi ci bërëb bu dàq."""" ""  This translates to Dustin Runnels speaking about Luna, expressing a complex and somewhat critical opinion.  The question asks *who* is criticizing Luna.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay fansam (The fans)** - While fans might have opinions, the text doesn't specifically state fans are criticizing Luna.
*   **C: Gëstukatu nguur gi (The story itself)** - The story *reports* on criticism, it doesn't *offer* it.
*   **D: Tommy Dreamer** - Tommy Dreamer speaks *about* Luna's legacy but doesn't express a critical opinion in the provided text. He actually seems to acknowledge her impact.



"
Lan moo dalul woon dowalkat ba bokkoon ca musiba ba?,"The correct answer is **C: Dañu ko toxaloon génneewee ko ca ap opitaal bu nekk Cambridge yoobu ko ci benn bu nekk ca Great Yarmouth.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ginnaaw gi toxal nañuko ca barap fajukaay bu Addenbrooke ci Cambridge. Ci bërëbu fajukaay bu James Paget ci Great Yarmouth lanu ko teyewoon.""  This directly translates to ""The injury took him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Previously, James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth treated him."" This aligns perfectly with option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Amoon na ay gaañu gaañu ca boppam ba"" - While true that he had many injuries, this doesn't answer *where* he was taken after the accident.
* **B:** ""Gaañulwoon kenn ca mbooloo ma nekkoon ca kër ga"" - This states he wasn't injured at home, which isn't the main point of the text.
* **D:** ""Këru walukat ya ñoo dimbëliwoon génnee ko ci wotoom"" - This doesn't relate to the hospital visits mentioned in the passage.

Lan moo nekkulwoon mbir mu jooli wul woon jëm ci suwe wu Afrik du sud ca diirub turnuwa rugby ba?,"The correct answer is **A: Bokk liggéeyëndoo bu yeeme** (They are very skilled players).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Afrik di Sid mi jiite turnuwaa bi tambali ba ci not bu baax ak ndam lu neex 26 – 00 seen digante ak Zambie..."" (South Africa won the tournament with a very good score of 26-00 against Zambia...).  This clearly indicates a high level of skill.
* **""Bokk liggéeyëndoo bu yeeme""** directly translates to ""They are very skilled players,"" aligning perfectly with the passage's description of South Africa's performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mën mënu jëf ak ball bi (They don't play with the ball):**  This is the opposite of what rugby involves.
* **C: Ap liggéey bu set ca ndoorteelu turnuwa ba (They set the rules of the tournaments):** The passage doesn't mention anything about rule-setting.
* **D: Ay mën mënu tëkku kaaraange (They don't have experience):** The passage implies they *do* have experience by stating they *won* the tournament convincingly.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan la sëwu Afrik du sud tambalee yees?","The correct answer is **A: Ca booru 10:00 ci suba**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Poyi dignu tambali ci 10:00 ci suba ak jawwu ju néx..."" (They will play the match at 10:00 in the morning with the next day...)
* The question asks *when* South Africa will play.  The passage directly answers that it's at 10:00 in the morning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba ñu xatalee tëkku kaarange gi:** (Because they finished the preparation) - While preparation is mentioned, it doesn't answer *when* they play.
* **C: Ba ñu ñàkkee ca jongante ak Zambie:** (Because they played against Zambia) - The passage mentions a past game against Zambia, not when the current game is.
* **D: Ba turnuwa ba wéyee:** (Because they won the tournament) - The passage mentions winning a tournament, but it doesn't relate to the timing of *this* game.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci baat yii toop ñoo dul wone koom koomu Chine?","The correct answer is **B: Chine am na marsé bu gëna rëy ci lii di toxal ay woto bitim réew wuuteeg Etat Unis.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Siin yobbu na ndaamaar yu bari ca Almaañ te ràw na Etaa Sini bi nekkoon màrsé bi gëna mag ci sektër bi."" (China has significant markets in Germany and has become a major player in the sector.) and ""Chine mën na gënë rëy bu United States ci ñaar fukki at."" (China's GDP is approaching that of the United States.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While *some* capital was borrowed, the passage focuses more on China *becoming* a market power, not just borrowing capital.
* **C:** The passage states the GDP is *approaching* the US, not that it's already equal.
* **D:** While Germany is mentioned as a market, the passage doesn't say China *surpasses* Germany in any significant way.  It's focused on the US comparison.



Therefore, option B best reflects the main points made in the passage regarding China's economic strength and its growing influence relative to the United States."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ la PIBwu Chine di mëna roopi bu Etat Unis?","The correct answer is **A: Di toop ay copite yu gëna bare ci koom koom** (It is due to the many investments made in the economy).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""GDP bu China mën na gënë rëy bu United States ci ñaar fukki at."" (China's GDP is now close to that of the United States.)  It then links this to investments made after Deng Xiaoping's reforms (""Coppiték komkom bi njeekk amoonna ci nguuruk Deng Xiaoping"").
* **Option A** directly reflects this idea – that economic growth is a result of investment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci diirub ñaari xarnu** (Due to the efforts of the people) - While people's efforts are important, the passage specifically highlights *investment* as the key driver.
* **C: Bu réew amee njiit mu bees** (Because the country has a lot of resources) - The passage doesn't mention natural resources as the primary reason.
* **D: Ci diirub ñeeti xarnu** (Due to the efforts of the leaders) - While leadership is important, the passage emphasizes the *actions* of investment, stemming from the policies initiated by Deng Xiaoping.



"
Lan la Hu digle ba Réew yuy magg yi nekk di def?,"The correct answer is **D: Moytu yoonu polusion yu magget yi** (Reducing major pollution issues).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hu dafa doon dooleel réew yu nekk ci yoonu yokkute “ngir moytu yoonu yaq bu njëkk bi te fomp ko ci apare.”"" This translates to ""He has started to visit countries in developed areas 'to reduce the first major issue and put it in appearance'.""  ""Yoonu yaq"" refers to problems/issues, and in context, it's clearly about environmental issues like carbon emissions (mentioned earlier in the passage).
* **The passage also states:** """"kenn waru leen woon wax ñu nangu jël au dogal yu weesu seen man-man, seen kàttan ak wareef"""" which translates to ""they all want to talk about reducing the impact on their resources, their economies and their environment.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jël ay wareef yuy puus seen bërëpu maggaay** (Talking about beautiful resources of great magnitude) - While the passage mentions resources, the focus isn't on *talking* about them being beautiful, but on *reducing impact* on them.
* **B: Jublu ci luy jur koom koom** (Celebrating their common history) -  The passage doesn't discuss history or celebrations.
* **C: Ropi seeniy sasu waxtu bii** (Changing their lifestyle slightly) - The passage focuses on larger systemic changes to address pollution, not individual lifestyle tweaks.



"
Lan la Hu waxulwoon?,"The correct answer is **C: Ap bës fu defaru Karbon di dogee ci yaakaar**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dina ñu def luñu mën ngir dàgg li diyoksitu karbon buy génn ci inité PIB..."" (They are looking for ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP...). This directly relates to reducing carbon emissions.
* **The passage also says:** ""...loolu la Hu wax."" (This is what Hu said).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Luy waral ay dog:** (Talking about a specific dog) - The passage doesn't focus on a dog.
* **B: Xelal réew yuy magg jëm ci polusion:** (About countries most affected by pollution) - While pollution is a related topic, the passage focuses on *reducing* emissions, not which countries are most affected.
* **D: Ap araf ngir dog luy defar karbon:** (Asking for ways to reduce carbon) - Hu *is* offering a solution, not asking for one.



Therefore, Hu is talking about **ways to reduce carbon emissions (Ap bës fu defaru Karbon di dogee ci yaakaar)**."
Ngir ban ci yii toopa taxoon ba Veerman wax ni mbir mi xew baaxulwoon?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The quote states: “Angola mu ngi ci duggu ci épidemi bi gëna bon te sitiyasiyoŋ bi dafa bon lool ca Angalo” which translates to ""Angola is in difficulty with the epidemic that is spreading and the situation is very bad in Angola."" Veerman is talking *about* Angola being in a bad situation. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Medecines Sans Frontiere:** While Veerman *works for* Medecines Sans Frontiere, the quote isn't *about* the organization itself.
*   **C: Mango:**  This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **D: Kureelu paj ci biir àddina bi yëpp:** This refers to the full name of the organization (CMC) and isn't the focus of Veerman's statement.



"
"Ndax toop bi, kan mooy jëli palaasu liggéeyukaayu Huhne?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ed Davey MP moo koy wuutu ci Cabinet bi."" (Ed Davey MP took his place in the Cabinet). This implies Davey replaced Huhne in a position of power/liggéeyukaayu. The text also mentions Huhne ""bayyi na liggéeyam"" (was replaced) and Davey taking over.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Starmer** - Starmer is mentioned as someone Huhne and Pryce are appearing with in court, not as a replacement.
*   **C: Lamb** - Lamb is mentioned as wanting the ministerial position, but didn't get it.
*   **D: Pryce** - Pryce is also appearing in court with Huhne, not a replacement.



"
Kan mooy topatoo ji liggéeyup Ministaru Bisnes ndax jiiñ bu ñu ko jiiñ?,"The correct answer is **C: Davey**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ed Davey MP moo koy wuutu ci Cabinet bi."" which translates to ""Ed Davey MP took his place in the Cabinet.""  It then says Norman Lamb was hoping to replace the Minister, but Davey was already in the position. This indicates Davey is the current Minister of Business.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lamb:** He *wanted* the position, but didn't get it.
*   **B: Huhne:** He is involved in a tribunal, but not the current minister.
*   **D: Starmer:** He's mentioned as asking questions, but not related to the Minister of Business role.



"
Lan la ñu doon jëf ñaax mbooloo mi def ko ca waxtu operaawu Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **D: Bàyyi lu ñu bëgg jiitël seen dund**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci mujjantél ga, ñoom toxnañu yamba ci bërëb bi, té theatre bi ci boppam di doolél nit yi ñu and ci ak ñom."" This translates to ""However, they often encountered difficulties, and the theater often had to accommodate those who came to see them."" This directly implies that people came specifically *to see* Saint-Saens and his work, often causing logistical challenges for the theatre.  This is best captured by ""Bàyyi lu ñu bëgg jiitël seen dund"" (People came to witness his art).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bokk ci di jëfëndikoo kanabis:** This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **B: Tukki dem Japon:** This is also irrelevant and not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Dem fekk leen ci kaw podiom bi suwe:**  While there might have been crowding, the passage focuses on people *coming* to see him, not just being crammed onto the podium.



"
Kan mooy tux boon bu njëkk ci waxtu opera bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Camille Saint-Saens**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that Camille Saint-Saens wrote the French opera. The question asks who composed the opera. Therefore, Camille Saint-Saens is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Artist bi** (The artist) - While true Saint-Saens *was* an artist, the passage is specifically about *who wrote* the opera.
*   **B: Mbooloo Français bi** (The French language) - The opera is *in* French, but the language isn't the composer.
*   **C: Ñu doon suwé** (They were successful) - The passage mentions success, but doesn't define *who* was successful in the context of the question."
Lan mooy beneen tur ngir “spacewalk” bu Leonov suwé?,"The correct answer is **B: Kurs ci jàwwu ji**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Leonov was the first to perform an ""EVA, wala «dox ci jawwu ji»"", which translates to ""extravehicular activity, or 'walk in space'"".  This is what a spacewalk is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Misiong Apollo-Soyuz:** While Leonov participated in this mission, it wasn't the event *for* which he was known for the first spacewalk.
*   **C: Jëfi woto:** This means ""first in space"" and refers to Yuri Gagarin, not Leonov's spacewalk.
*   **D: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is just his designation, not what he did.



"
Ban faanu misiongu Sovietik la Leonov jiitewoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Kurs bi ci jàwwu ji** (Walk in space).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci 18i fan ci weeru Màrs, 1965 da fa def jëf bu njëkk genn ci woto bi (EVA), wala « dox ci jawwu ji»...""  This directly translates to ""On March 18, 1965, he became the first man to conduct a spacewalk (EVA), or 'walk in space'...""
* The passage clearly identifies the spacewalk as Leonov's pioneering achievement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Apollo-Soyuz:** This was a *later* joint mission with the US, not Leonov's first mission.
* **C: Cosmonaut No. 11:** This is just his designation, not the mission itself.
* **D: EVA:** While EVA *is* the technical term for a spacewalk, the question asks what *mission* Leonov pioneered, and the passage specifically highlights the ""walk in space"" aspect.



"
Kan moo gaañuwoon ca musiba ba?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gibson yóbb nañu ko lopital wante da mujje ñakk bàkkanam diir bu yàggul ba mu eggee."" This translates to ""Gibson was taken to the hospital because of the serious injuries he sustained.""  Therefore, Gibson is the one who suffered in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ap liggéeykat cib gaaraas:** This means ""People who came to the scene of the accident"". While people *were* present, they aren't the ones *suffering* from the accident.
* **C: Ay gone:** This means ""Some people"". Too vague.
* **D: Ap dowalkatu kamiyon:** This means ""The truck driver"". The passage doesn't state the truck driver was injured or is the focus of the misfortune.



"
Lan moo daloon nit yu bokkoon ci musiba ba?,"The correct answer is **C: Dañu doon yuuxu ak a jooy.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Am na ay xale yu doon xaar ngir jeggi tali bi te ñoom ñeppa doon yóoxu ak joy.""  This translates to ""There are people who went to see the accident, and many were left shocked and saddened.""  ""Yuuxu ak jooy"" means ""shocked and saddened.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñoom ñaar ñëppa dee:**  (Many people died) - The passage doesn't explicitly state anyone *died*, only that people were shocked and saddened.
* **B: Kenn moo gaañuwoon, keneen ki dee:** (Nobody was hurt, everyone is okay) - This is the opposite of what the passage implies with the shock and sadness.
* **D: Ñoom ñaar ñëpp a gaañuwoon:** (Many people were hurt) - The passage doesn't state people were *hurt*, just affected emotionally.



"
Sientifik yu doon liggéey ci porogram bi ñoo doon yaakaar a gis ay mbir yu lan ci yii toop indi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ay partikul yu ndaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xalaat bii dafay wax ni li ëpp ci li ñuul ci galaksi bi mu ngi nekk ci benn xeetu halo, te dafa àndak ay partikul yu ndaw yu bari.""  This translates to ""The results show that everything in the galaxy is in a large halo, and is made of large dark particles.""

The question asks what scientists are trying to find with the program. The text directly states they are looking for these ""dark particles.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay mbir yu tamm am:** (Complete stars) - The passage doesn't focus on finding complete stars.
*   **B: Dooleey maare:** (Just position) - While position is involved, the key focus is *what* they are finding the position *of*.
*   **D: Ay mbir yu ñuul:** (Stars in the galaxy) -  The passage is about looking *within* the galaxy for something fundamental, not just cataloging existing stars.



"
Ban ci mbir yii toop la sientifik yi doon xool?,"The correct answer is **B: Suuf si ak danku Sagittaire bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ni weer wi ame doole ci suuf si bay yëkkëti géej gi, noonu la Milky Way bi ame doole ci galaxie Sagitarius.""  This translates to: ""If we are located in the center of the galaxy, then the Milky Way is located in the Sagittarius galaxy.""
* **The question asks:** Which stars are scientists studying?
* The passage specifically mentions studying the center (""suuf si"") and the Sagittarius galaxy (""danku Sagittaire bi"") to understand their position and relation to the Milky Way.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yoon wu am Meew mi ak Wéer bi** -  This option isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Suuf si ak Wéer bi** - While ""suuf si"" (the center) is mentioned, ""Wéer bi"" is not.
* **D: Danku Sagittaire bi ak Yoonu meew mi** - ""Yoonu meew mi"" (Meew stars) is not mentioned.



"
"Buñu sukkandikoo ci mbind mii, lan la konserwatër dul ŋàññ?","The correct answer is **A: Dépensu ndimbël (Financial expenditure)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""...ci depensë yi aju ci ndimbal ak defaraat gannaaw uragaan Katrina..."" which translates to ""...concerning expenditures related to aid and the consequences of hurricane Katrina...""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What was the conservatives' concern?
* The passage links the conservatives to the idea of expenses related to Katrina (""Pexem Bush ngir Nouvelle Orleans"" - Blaming Bush for New Orleans). This implies their concern was *how* the money was being spent (or potentially *too much* money was being spent).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñakkub dooleeb tabaxaat (Tax increases):** The passage doesn't mention taxes.
* **C: Kan la ñuy sargal ay kontraawu tabaxaat (They opposed tax contracts):** This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **D: Dépensu tabaxaat (Tax expenditure):**  This is related to spending, but ""ndimbël"" (aid/relief) is more directly tied to the context of Hurricane Katrina.



"
Kan mooy ngaññ kontrawu tabaxaat bi ngir liggéeyu ndimbël yi ndax ouragan Katrina?,"The correct answer is **A: Konservatër fisko (Fiscal conservatives)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ay konserwaatër dupe nanu ko ci ay tooñ """"Pexem Bush ngir Nouvelle Orleans."""" (conservatives supported a position """"Blame Bush for New Orleans."""")
* **The question asks:** Who was primarily responsible for the controversy surrounding the response to Hurricane Katrina?
* The passage directly links conservatives to criticizing Bush's handling of the situation, making them the central group in the controversy described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Libero yi (Liberals):** The passage says liberals *were happy* with the criticism of the government, but they weren't the *source* of the criticism.
* **C: Bush:** While Bush was the subject of blame, the question asks *who* was doing the blaming, not *who* was being blamed.
* **D: Inisié yu Washington (Washington insiders):** This is too broad.  The passage only mentions them as being the target of the liberals' observations.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, fan la lamp yu Stardust véso spasio yi di njëkka féññ?","The correct answer is **B: Bët-gànnaaru Californie** (Northern California).

Here's why:

The text states: “Dina dem ci peggu géej gi ci bët gannaaru Kaliforni te dina leeral asamaan ci ca kaliforni jaare ko ci Oregon bi ci digg bi te wey ci Nevada ak Idaaho ak ciUtah,” 

This translates to: ""It landed in the north of California or could also be seen in the skies over California and then passed over Oregon, then onward to Nevada, Idaho and Utah.""

Therefore, the initial landing spot was in Northern California. The other options are mentioned as places the capsule *passed over*, not where it initially landed."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, véso spasial bi dina samp ap rëkoor ngir yan ci yii toop?","The correct answer is **C: Delusiwaat ci kaw Suuf ci bu gëna gaaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stardust dina amal benn rekoor gaaw ngir nékk roppalaan bi gëna gaaw ngir ñibbisi ci suuf, raw bi fi nekkon ci weeru Mé atum 1969 bi Apollo X Command module doon ñibbisi.""  This directly translates to ""Stardust set a new speed record for returning to Earth from space, faster than what was achieved in May 1969 by the Apollo X Command Module.""  Therefore, the spaceship achieved a record for *speed in returning from space*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Leeral gaam gu gëna yaatu ci asamaan** - (Traveling a long distance in the sky) - The passage mentions distance but focuses on *speed* of return.
*   **B: Féññ ci dëkk yu gëna bare** - (Landing in different places) - The passage mentions the states it flew over, not landing locations.
*   **D: Tukkee San Francisco dem Los Angeles ci bu gëna gaaw** - (Traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles at high speed) - This is a detail about the *route* of a simulation, not the spaceship's actual record.



"
Naka la Dr Malar Balasubramanian bokkee ak Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Yaay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Foofu, ñoom gis nanu fa neewuu Saroja Balasubraamanian, 53, nu muur ko ak sër bu takk deret."" This translates to ""However, they found her mother, Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, who died of a heart attack.""

Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian is Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother, making them a **yaay** (mother-son) relationship.



"
Fan la ñu giseewoon yaramu Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **A: Ca Cincinnati**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29 at, ci Blue Ash lañ ko gisee, Ohio, ab banliyë bu toll ci 15 kilomeetat ci bëj-gannaaru Cincinnati...""  This means Dr. Balasubramanian lives near Cincinnati, Ohio, and therefore Saroja Balasubramanian (his mother) was found near Cincinnati as well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ci weru tali bi** - The text mentions a ""weru tali bi"" (forest) but doesn't state Saroja was found *in* it, only that the car was near it.
*   **C: Ci ap kapowu woto** - There's no mention of this location in the text.
*   **D: Ca Pittsburgh** - The text states the family is *from* Pittsburgh, but Saroja was found near Cincinnati.



"
Lan la eBay jëndoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""mu mëna am doole ji Skype am ci réew yu mag yu ci melni Chine, Europe gu Penku ak Brésil."" (He sells things on Skype in countries like China, Penku Europe and Brazil).  Then it says he found them on eBay. This implies eBay is where he *finds* the items he then sells on Skype.

The passage also mentions that the person uses Skype to sell. Skype was *bought by Microsoft* in 2003. Therefore, eBay is associated with Microsoft through Skype.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Apple:** Has no direct connection mentioned in the text.
*   **Skype:** While mentioned, it's the platform *used* not the owner of eBay.
*   **Zoom:** Not mentioned in the passage.



"
Lan la eBay bëgg a jot ak njënd mi?,"The correct answer is **A: Gëna taxawal koom koomam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mooy amef bi gëna rey ci jaar jaaru eBay."" (He/She is someone who sells things on eBay.) and ""Amna yaakaar indi yokkute ak wuute ci liggéeyam..."" (He/She deals with buying and selling...)
* This directly implies eBay is a platform for **selling things (gëna taxawal)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Law ci yeneeni dëkk:** (It's a shop) - While items *are* sold *through* eBay, eBay isn't a single shop itself. It's a platform for many sellers.
* **C: Yëkëti nataalam:** (It's an advertising platform) - Advertising happens *on* eBay, but it's not its primary function.
* **D: Beggël ay aksionéram:** (It belongs to shareholders) - This is about ownership of the company, not what it *does*.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate description of what eBay is, based on the provided text.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo jokkoowulwoon ak ñuñu tejoon kaso te ñu desoon ci ët bi aparee xeex mi?","The correct answer is **A: Negosiatër yi (Negotiators)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a hostage situation at a hospital. It mentions ""waxtaan yi doon nañu jéema jubbanti diggante yi"" which translates to ""officials wanted to establish negotiations with the hostage takers.""  The passage then details a timeline of events related to these negotiations and ultimately, the release of the hostages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ekip yu leen wallu ci xal mi (The team that was with them):** The text doesn't specify a team accompanying the hostages; it focuses on the negotiation process.
* **C: Soldaar yi (Soldiers):** While soldiers *might* be involved in a hostage situation, the text specifically highlights *negotiations* as the primary tactic. There's no mention of military intervention.
* **D: Liggéeykatu opitaal (Hospital administrators):**  While hospital administrators are present, the text focuses on those *negotiating* with the hostage takers, not just the hospital staff.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo tax ba ñuñu tej kaso delu ganaaw ci xeex mi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñuñu bokkal kaso te ñu gaañu** (They discussed cases and went to the hospital).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bi xeex bi jeexee ginaaw bi ñu yóbbee ñi ci am ay gaañu-gaañu ca hopital ba..."" (The story begins with them taking someone to the hospital...). This directly indicates a discussion of cases *leading* to a hospital visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay negosiasion yu am ndam (Some negotiations that happened):** While there's mention of ""waxtaan yi doon nañu jéema jubbanti diggante yi"" (lawyers wanting to negotiate), it's not the *initial* reason for going to the hospital.
* **B: Gas lakrimosén (Tear gas):**  This is mentioned later in the passage as something used *at* the prison, not the reason for the initial trip.
* **D: Ap safara (A trip):**  Too vague. The passage specifies a hospital visit related to cases.



"
"Ci xalaatu Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ci lan la réewub Iran gorelee boppam?","The correct answer is **B: Revolusion Islamik bi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...dale ko laata iran di def fippu diine googule ca 1979 te nga xam ne dëkk bi waroon na ci moom boppam."" This directly translates to ""...remember that Iran rejected the influence of foreign powers in 1979 and you know that the state relies on this independence.""  1979 is the year of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the text links this rejection of foreign influence (and thus, independence) to that event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay yemale ci koopar:** (A desire for cooperation) - The text doesn't focus on a desire for cooperation.
*   **C: Koom koom gu jogee ci bitim réew:** (A community based on oil) - The text doesn't emphasize a community aspect around oil.
*   **D: Ap dependaans ci petrol:** (An end to dependence on petrol) - While the leader speaks of ""jebakan"" (presumably a trap related to oil), the text doesn't state that Iran *wants* to end its dependence. It emphasizes protecting its oil resources as a source of independence.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan moo nanguwoon mbir yu doom yu ñu doom koom koomu Iran indi?","The correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njiit lu mag li ci dëkk bi, Ayatollah ali Khamenei, dafa misaal ajju ci kenn ngir wàllu petorol ne ab “jebakan”, dale ko laata iran di def fippu diine googule ca 1979 te nga xam ne dëkk bi waroon na ci moom boppam."" 

This translates to: ""The most important person in the country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has issued an order concerning the sale of oil, stating it is a 'trap,' recalling Iran's fall after the Islamic revolution in 1979 and noting that the country relies on this income.""

Therefore, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the one who is making decisions about and speaking out regarding oil in Iran.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo bokkul ci nu France di wotee?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay boyetu wote yu leer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Liko dale ci atum 1988 ba tey, boyetu wotekaay yi dafa wara yaraax ba tanëkaat yi ak ceytukat wote gi mën seede ne benn enwëlop neku ci bala ñuy tambali."" This translates to: ""Since 1988, voters have been able to choose between candidates and vote by mail, meaning an envelope can be sent to them.""

This directly refers to *voters* (boyetu wote) being able to vote. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Teewalkat yu kandida yi yondee:** This refers to campaign managers, not who is voting.
* **C: Siñé ap list elektoraal:** This refers to the electoral list, not the voters themselves.
* **D: Wote yu teewalkatu kandida yi waññi:** This means the votes *for* candidates, not the voters.



"
Fan la ñuy wote di waxee seen kandida bu ñu tànn?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci ap envelop**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...dugeel benn keyit buy mandarga ki ñu tànn ci beenn enwelop."" ( ...often a list is used which is marked on envelopes.) and ""...kenn yókkul benn enwëlop gannaaw yooyu nu wàñi ak wotekat yi nu jox ndigal ñu wote."" (...sometimes an envelope is given to you which you fill out and return with your vote.). This directly indicates that voters mark their choices *on the envelopes*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ci ap listu elektoraal** - While a list might be *used*, the marking is done *on* something else.
*   **B: Ci ap kayit bu ñu pre-imprimé** - The text doesn't specify pre-printed forms, just a list.
*   **D: Ci ap masin ci biir ap estand** - The text describes a very low-tech, manual process, not using machines.



"
Lan moo yoobu Allen tambali ap gëstu bu juroom ñeeti àt ngir Musashi?,"The correct answer is **B: Intereem bu ko kartografi suufu géej yi amal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bi ñu toppé kartogaraafi alali yi ci géej gi..."" (They used advanced cartography on the seabed...) This directly indicates Allen's involvement in mapping the seabed.
* **The passage further explains:** This mapping was done *to* find Musashi, linking the cartography directly to the search.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alalam:** While Allen is a person, the passage focuses on *what* they did, not just their existence.
* **C: Investismenwam ci explorasion géej:**  Investment is a possibility, but the text highlights the *action* of mapping, not the financial backing.
* **D: Intereem ci xare gi:** The passage doesn't mention anything about interest in the network.



Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects Allen’s role as described in the passage - engaging in advanced seabed cartography."
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ci lan la Allen depense xaalisam gu takku?","The correct answer is **A: Deloowaat Musashi bi** (Finding the Musashi).

Here's why:

The passage states Allen swore to find the Musashi. The entire effort – the mapping, the ROV, the expense – is *for* finding the Musashi. The question asks what Allen spent the most resources on. Therefore, finding the Musashi is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gëstu géej gi** (Managing the seabed) - This is *part* of the process, but not the ultimate goal.
* **C: Tabax ap ROV** (The cost of the ROV) - The ROV is a tool, the cost is a detail, not the primary expenditure.
* **D: Jàng mbirup kartografi géej gi** (Creating a seabed map) - Mapping is a necessary step, but again, not the final objective.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop ñoo yoobu ci ay kondision yu asardës ci biir ak ci lu wër garab gi?","The correct answer is **B: Cesium radioactif**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""rajoaktiv caesum ak iodine gis nanu ko ci këru liggéeyukaay bi"" (radioactive cesium and iodine were found in the soil). This directly links cesium to the hazardous conditions.
* The question asks about what was found that created dangerous conditions in the soil and water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kombustible bu uraniom (Uranium fuel):** While the passage mentions uranium containers, it doesn't state that uranium *itself* was found contaminating the soil and water. The concern is about leaks from the containers.
* **C: Saxaar bu weex (Dust):** Dust is mentioned as a result of the event, but it's the *radioactive contaminants* within the dust (cesium and iodine) that are the hazard.
* **D: Iode (Iodine):** While iodine is mentioned alongside cesium, the question asks for a *single* answer and cesium is more prominently linked to the contamination.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo nekkul benn ci xelalu kaaraange yu ñu xelal ñu dëkk ci bërëp bi di toop xew xew gi ca garab ga?,"The correct answer is **D: Bañ leen a naan ndoxum robiné** (They let them eat robin's food - meaning they provided them with food).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**...fay seeni klimatisër ak baña naan ndoxu robine bi.**"" This directly translates to ""...provided them with air conditioning and let them eat robin's food.""  The ""robin's food"" is a metaphor for providing them with sustenance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moytu leen di jëfëndikoo ay unité kilimatisër** (They helped them defend air conditioning units) - While they *provided* air conditioning, the passage doesn't mention defending them.
* **B: Dess leen ci biir** (They gave them beer) - The passage doesn't mention beer.
* **C: Moytu leen di nooyi saxaar gu weex gi** (They helped them with the difficult work) - While the work was likely difficult, the passage doesn't specifically state they *helped* with the work. It states they were *made* to do it.



"
"Jëm ci lu Dr Moll wax, lan la ñu wara gëna seetlu jëm ci XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **B: Ni variant bi di tëkkoo garab yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states Dr. Moll found that patients with XDR-TB were ""amoonna jaxasoo yu mag té ragallu ndax ray gu bari gi"" – meaning they had a genetic mutation that made the TB resistant. This directly relates to the variant of the disease being more aggressive and harder to treat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Variant bi di ap kontra ci biir opitaal bi** - The passage doesn’t mention the variant being contracted *in* the hospital, but rather *among* patients in the hospital.
*   **C: Ñaata nit kenn ku am jàngoro ji mëna waal** - The passage states a percentage *do* have XDR-TB (6,000 out of 330,000).
*   **D: Toowu réyam gu kawe** - While XDR-TB is a serious problem, the passage focuses on the *genetic mutation* driving its severity, not just its overall impact.



"
Ñaata pasien yu am variant bu bees bi la ñu dëggëloon ni ay liggéeykatu paj mi la ñu?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ci benn laaj ak tontu, neewon na soppité yu bées yi """"amoonna jaxasoo yu mag té ragallu ndax ray gu bari gi."""" ... gën gaa neew ñaar yi ci lopitaal bi lañu daan liggéeyee.""  This translates to: ""In a recent study, they found a few patients with """"extremely drug-resistant strains that are very contagious."""" ... it was found that the next two patients in the hospital had also been infected.""

Therefore, only **2** patients were found to have the extremely drug-resistant variant and were infected.



"
Ban faanu teknolosi la sisteemu NextGen di jëfëndikoo?,"The correct answer is **A: Teknolosi bu sukkëndiku ci satelit** (Technology that relies on satellites).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dafay jëfandikoo satelit bu xarale bu nu mengalee ko radaar..."" (It uses satellite technology that we use with radar...).  This directly links the NextGen system to satellite technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Teknolosiwu precision** (Precision technology) - While precision is *part* of NextGen, it's not the defining technology mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Teknolosi bu sukkëndiku ci radaaru suuf** (Technology that relies on advanced radar) - Radar is *used with* the satellites, but the satellites are the core technology highlighted.
* **D: Teknolosi bu wasaare carbone yi** (Technology for reducing carbon) - The passage mentions carbon emissions as a *result* of air travel, not as the basis of the NextGen technology itself.



"
Naka la NextGen di jëriñee direkt kontrolëru trafik aerien yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay yoonu naaw yu gëna gaat**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""NextGen ab jumtukaay la bu FAA wax ne dina may fafalndaaw yi daw yoon yu bariwul te sàkkanal ay miliyong galoon wu kerosene at mu nekk te wàññi gennee karbon... ci yoon ak xibaar yu leer.""  This translates to: ""NextGen helps the FAA reduce delays, save millions of gallons of kerosene and reduce carbon emissions...with more efficient and safer routes.""
* **Question (Q) asks:** ""Does NextGen directly control air traffic controllers?""
* **Option A (""Ay yoonu naaw yu gëna gaat"" - ""It helps to make things easier"")** directly aligns with the passage's description of NextGen *assisting* and *improving* the system, which includes benefitting air traffic control. It doesn't *directly control* them, but *helps* them.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Xam bu baax bërëpu roopalaan yi (""Good example of replacing planes"")** – The passage doesn't discuss replacing planes.
    * **C: Wàññi wasarewu Karbon (""Reducing carbon emissions"")** – While NextGen *does* reduce carbon emissions, that's a *result* of its function, not its primary purpose of assisting controllers.
    * **D: Petrol gu neew (""New petrol"")** – This is irrelevant to the passage.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ci lan la taariixkat yi ngaññul FBI bi ci lu ñu waroon na jublu?","The correct answer is **C: Jublu bu baax ci kaa wu pornografi** (Significant involvement in pornography cases).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...FBI dafa wara tanë 10 ci liggéey katam ngir nu jublu ci wàllu pornoo mag."" This directly translates to ""...the FBI has been working on 10 cases to help them get involved in large pornography matters.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Buste seen toowu ndam:** (Some damaging information) - While the passage hints at potentially damaging information, it doesn't specifically state this is what the history is about.
* **B: Jagleel xaalis réy yu gëna yomb saafara:** (Illegal financial transactions) - The passage mentions ""daamar"" (money) but doesn't focus on illegal transactions.
* **D: Ay kaa wu woto yu ñu sacc:** (Some cases that were concealed) - The passage doesn't mention concealment, but rather involvement in pornography cases.



"
Lan la initiativ obsén forsé FBI def ko?,"The correct answer is **D: Ay asen yu soobu ci kaa wu pornografi** (Investigations into cases of pornography).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...ngir yokk ndamu keer gi. Mbootay bi tàambalina wuut koppar ngir ay pexe yu ñaaw si xol ci lempo 2005 ak leeral ni FBI dafa wara tanë 10 ci liggéey katam ngir nu jublu ci wàllu pornoo mag."" This translates to ""...to protect children. The operation started investigating cases involving child pornography circulating around 2005 and reportedly the FBI has been working on 10 similar cases to help them capture the people involved in child pornography.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jagleel xaalis bu gëna bare woto yu ñu sacc:** (Illegal sales of stolen goods) - While the FBI investigates many crimes, the passage focuses specifically on pornography.
* **B: Busté too wu ndamu asans bi:** (Arrest a suspect) - Arrests are a *result* of investigations, not the initiating force behind them.
* **C: Jublu ci réy yuy yomba saafara:** (Help in safe travel for children) - This is unrelated to the content of the passage.



"
Lan moo xew ak woto pompier mi tontuwoon karash ba bu JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The text states the JAS 39C Gripen landed at 9h30 (0230 UTC) and was then used for commercial flights. It also mentions Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee was piloting.  There's **no mention of any crash, fire, explosion, or gas leak**.

Therefore, the most logical answer is **A: Dafa karash** (There was a crash) is incorrect because the text explicitly states the plane *landed* and was then used for commercial flights, implying it was functioning normally.

The best answer, considering the lack of any negative events described, is **B: Dafa wëlbëtiku ci boppam** (It was safe and sound).  Although not explicitly stated, the continuation of commercial flights suggests no incident occurred.



"
"Toop karashu JAS 39C Gripen, aeropor bi moo jegewoon lan?","The correct answer is **A: Wol komersial yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ñu tere lépp luy vol commercial ci aeroport bi."" which translates to ""...they cleared the way for commercial flights at the airport."" This directly indicates the airport handles commercial flights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Woto pompier (Fire trucks):** While fire trucks are present at airports, the text doesn't suggest this is the airport's primary function.
* **C: Mediawu dëkk bi (Local traffic):** The text is about an airplane and airport operations, not general local traffic.
* **D: Seefu eskadron yi (Squadron headquarters):** While a Squadron Leader is mentioned, the airport isn't *defined* as a squadron headquarters.



"
Kan la Brzezinsku may ndimbël ca diirub Revolution Iranienne ba?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Niki ab NSA, jàppale na Carter ngir saytu ci anam bu rafet mbiri addina bi, yu melni Deggoo yuñu amal ci Camp David, ci atum 1978; tek lëkkaloo Amerik ak Siin ci ay Sàrt ci njextalu ati 1970 yi, **Rewolisiyoŋ bu Iran, bi waraloon ay kirisu otaas yi ci Iran, 1979**; ak congum Sowiyetik yi ci Afganistaan, 1979.""

This directly links Brzezinski's role as NSA to dealing with the Iranian Revolution *while working with Carter*.  The other options are incorrect as they are not mentioned in the context of the Iranian Revolution in the provided text.



"
Kan moo amoon palaasu Digëlkat ci walum kaaraange ba ca àtum 1977?,"The correct answer is **A: Brzezinski**.

The text states: ""Ci diiru tànneef yu 1976 dafa diggal Carter ci politiku bitim réew, daldi liggéey ne Joxekatu Xalaat ci Karaange Biir Réew mi (NSA) dalee ko ci 1977 ba 1981, wutu Henry Kissinger.""  This directly says Brzezinski became National Security Advisor (Joxekatu Xalaat ci Karaange Biir Réew mi - palaasu Digëlkat ci walum kaaraange) in 1977, replacing Henry Kissinger.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul wone ci bu baax karieru Bobek ak Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **C: Wute woon nañu ko ni suwër bu gëna baax ci taariixu ekip bi** (It is said that he is a player who is very important in the history of the team).

Here's why:

* **The passage states Bobek was a key player for Partizan Belgrade for 13 years (1945-1958).** It highlights his importance (""dugalonna nienti temer ak niet ci ay bii té nienti temer ak jirom"") and suggests he was crucial to the club's success.
* **Option A (468 games played) is a statistic, but doesn't *explain* his importance.** Just playing a lot of games doesn't make someone a legend.
* **Option B (scored a lot of goals) isn't mentioned in the passage.** We don't know if he was a prolific scorer.
* **Option D (played in many important matches) is too vague.**  While likely true, it doesn't capture the overall significance the passage implies.

Option C best reflects the overall sentiment of the passage: Bobek was a *significant* and *important* player in Partizan Belgrade's history.



"
Ban baat jëm ci taariixu Bobek ak Partizan Belgrade mooy dëgg?,"The correct answer is **C: Dafa suweel Partizan ba ca àtum 1995**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fekki na leen ci atum 1945 te desna ci ba atum 1958."" (He played for them from 1945 to 1958) and ""Ci atum 1995 faloon nañu ko jonŋatekat bi gëna xarañ ci jaar-jaaru Partizan."" (In 1995, his legacy was honored in Partizan's history). This clearly indicates a long association with Partizan, concluding (in terms of legacy recognition) in 1995.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dafa tambalee suweel Partizan ci àtum 1945** - While he *started* playing in 1945, it doesn't capture the full extent of his connection.
* **B: Dafa suweel Zagreb balaa Partizan Belgrade** - The passage states he played *for* Partizan, not Zagreb.
* **D: Siiw na tambalee ba ñu ko wotee suwëru bu gëna baax ci Partizan** - This is too vague.  The passage focuses on his playing time and eventual honor, not just being a ""good player"".



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban melokaan mooy wuuteel Hesperonychus ak Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **A: Dafa am ñaari tank (They have similar sizes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dañoo yaakaaroon ni picc bu bari duŋk yu tàng ak déret bu tàng dafa taxawoon ci ñaari tankam ak ay wey melni Velociraptor."" This translates to: ""Their characteristics, especially the size of their bones, are similar in size to those of Velociraptor.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dafa am ñaareelu wee bu gëna gudd (They have claws that are very strong):** While the passage mentions claws (""griffe""), it doesn't focus on their *strength*, but rather their location and a nickname (""griffe occidentale"").
*   **C: Dafa am ap yaram bu fees ak dunku (They have many differences in shape and size):** The passage emphasizes *similarities* in size, not differences.
*   **D: Dereetam dafa tang (Their teeth are the same):** The passage doesn't mention teeth.



"
Lu “Hesperonychus” di fiirndeel jogee na cii melokaanu jëmu xeet yi?,"The correct answer is **B: Yaramu dunku yi** (Their claws).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the claws of *Hesperonychus elizabethae*.** It specifically states: ""Ñaareelu wewam (griffe) moo gëna rëy, moo waral ñu tuddee ko Hesperonychus biy tekki """"griffe occidentale""""."" which translates to ""Their claws (griffes) are very curved, and because of this *Hesperonychus* is nicknamed """"western claw"""".""
* **""Yaramu dunku yi""** directly translates to ""their claws"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wee bi(yi)** - This likely translates to ""It is small/young"" - the passage doesn't *primarily* focus on its size, though it's a small dinosaur.
* **C: Tank yi** - This likely translates to ""Their necks"" - the passage doesn't mention the neck.
* **D: Bek bi** - This likely translates to ""Their head"" - the passage doesn't focus on the head.



"
Ban ci baat yii toop jëm ci fit fetal yi mooy dëgg?,"The correct answer is **A: Jëkër jeeg jabar ji ñoom ñaar ñëpp a jogee Texas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ñoom ñaar ñoo ngi seyoon ca Texas benn at ci ginnaaw te ñëw fii ci Buffalo ngir feete ko ak seeni xarit ak seeni mbokk."" (Some of them lived in Texas first and then moved to Buffalo to meet with their family and friends.) This directly refers to people *moving* from Texas.
* **The question asks:** What is a common theme related to the movement of people?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Juroomi nit ñoo ci sanku:**  The passage doesn't focus on the *number* of people, but their movement.
* **C: Kupal bi seyoon na benn àt ca ganaaw ca Buffalo:** This refers to living in Buffalo, not the initial movement *to* Buffalo.
* **D: Fiitu fetal bi amee na ca Buffalo:**  This is a detail about being born in Buffalo, not the relocation aspect.



Therefore, option A best captures the central idea of people relocating from Texas."
Ban ci yii baat jëm ci li xew fu fit fetal bi amee ndax dëgg la?,"The correct answer is **A: Amoon na ca ap feetu aniverseer ca Buffalo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ngir feetal aniwerseeru jëkkër ak jabar ju njëkk ñoo xam ne seen ceyt daaw... ñëw fii ci Buffalo ngir feete ko ak seeni xarit ak seeni mbokk.""  This translates to: ""to celebrate the anniversary of the leader and his companions who first came to this world... they went to Buffalo to celebrate it with their family and friends.""

The question asks *where* the celebration (fetal) happens. The text clearly states it's in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the anniversary *is* important, the question asks *where* it takes place.
* **C:** Texas is mentioned as a place people *come from*, not where the celebration happens.
* **D:** ""Mariasu kupal"" (hospitality) isn't directly related to the location of the celebration.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan la liggéeykat yi doon xalaat jëm ci Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Karburan buy tuuru**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Luno bi amonna 120-160 cubic metres bu fuel..."" (Luno requires 120-160 cubic meters of fuel...) This directly refers to fuel/karburan being a key element needed on Luno.
* **The question asks:** What is a key thing needed on Luno?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñakkup kargoowu engaré:** (Some cargo is transported) - The passage doesn't emphasize cargo as a *need* for Luno, only fuel.
* **B: Wag yi ak ngelaw yu bare:** (Cars and bare rocks) - This isn't mentioned in the passage as being crucial for Luno.
* **D: Ay gaañu gaañu ci ñu bokk ci mbooloom liggeykat yi:** (Very much in the involvement of the logistics team) - This talks about *people* involved, not a *thing* needed.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci baat yii toop jëm ci paanu Luno moo dul dëgg?","The correct answer is **A: Paan bi xew na balaa muy jël kargéson bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Luno needs 120-160 cubic meters of fuel to complete the work.** This directly relates to the *cost* of the operation (""paan"" meaning cost/expense).  The passage focuses on fuel consumption as a major factor in the expense.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** While the height of 100 meters is mentioned, it's about the fertilizer spreading, *not* the cost of the fuel.
    * **C:**  The passage doesn't discuss members or teams (""ñaari membar yi"") being in danger.
    * **D:**  The passage doesn't talk about *pushing* the plane (""puusoon""). It discusses its landing.

**Translation of relevant parts to confirm:**

* ""Luno bi amonna 120-160 cubic metres bu fuel..."" - ""Luno needs 120-160 cubic meters of fuel...""
* ""...moo dul dëgg?"" - ""...what is the cost?"" (referring to Luno's operation)
* ""Paan bi xew na balaa muy jël kargéson bi"" - ""The new cost is very high for cargo"" (the fuel is essentially the cargo cost).



"
Ci ban xarnu la Algerie amee tembam?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci ati 1960 yi, mu dellu ci Alseri..."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he moved to Algeria...""  This directly indicates that Jeefi Vautier went to Algeria in the 1960s. 

Therefore, Algeria is mentioned in connection with the 1960s within the text."
Fan la ay xoolukaayu television taakulwoon ngir xewu déj wi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci biir Room yëpp** (In the streets of Rome).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ay Ekarang telewisiyong yu mag yu bare la nu teg ci bërëb y wute ci Rome ngir bàyyi nit ñi nu xool xew xew bi.""  This translates to ""Many television cameras were set up on the streets and in Rome to show people the new news.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci yenn dëkku Italie yi** (In the shops of Italy) - The text doesn't mention cameras being in shops.
* **C: Ci yenn bërëp yi ci Pologne** (In the fields of Poland) - The text mentions Poland as a location where reports were *sent to*, not where the cameras were.
* **D: Ci palaasu St Pierre** (In St. Peter's Palace) - While the text mentions St. Peter's Square, it doesn't say the cameras were *in* a palace. They were in the streets to show the events happening *around* St. Peter’s Square.



"
Fan la ñu ameewoon xewu déj wi?,"The correct answer is **D: Bu njëkk ci Room, teg ci beneen dëkku Italie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Limu nit yi téwoon yatuwonna ba ñepp mënu ñu woona téewé dëjj bi ci St. Peter’s Square."" (Many people gathered to watch the event live in St. Peter’s Square.) and ""Ay Ekarang telewisiyong yu mag yu bare la nu teg ci bërëb y wute ci Rome ngir bàyyi nit ñi nu xool xew xew bi."" (Many television stations broadcast live from Rome to show the new event to people all over the world).
* **It also mentions:**  broadcasting from Italy (""Ci dëkk yu bare ci Itali"") and Poland (""rawatina ci Pologne"").

Therefore, the event was *initiated* in Rome, and broadcast *from* Rome and Italy, with coverage also extending to Poland.  Option D best reflects this combined information.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci yenn bërëp ci Room** - Too vague.  It was specifically in St. Peter’s Square.
* **B: Ci Pologne** - Poland received broadcasts *of* the event, it wasn't where the event *happened*.
* **C: Ci palaasu St Pierre** -  St. Peter's Square is *near* St. Peter's Palace, but the event was in the square itself."
"Toop eksplosision bi, kan la ñu doon faj ndax ay gaañu gaañu yu meti?","The correct answer is **A: Lu toolë ci juroomi nit**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Guisuñu ñu am ay gaañu - gaañu yu tarr, wante lu yées juróomi nit ñu nekkoon ci kaw sen bi ba ndel la di tàkk faj nanu leen ngir ay màndargayi tiitange."" This translates to: ""They had many things - bad things, because the sins of people were accumulating in that street, and they started to pay for their mistakes for certain advantages.""

* **The question asks:** What caused the explosion, as it relates to the bad things mentioned?

* **Option A (""Lu toolë ci juroomi nit"" - The sins of people) directly addresses the cause identified in the passage.**  The ""bad things"" and the subsequent consequences (the explosion) are linked to the sins/wrongdoings of the people living there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kenn (Nothing)** - The passage clearly indicates a cause.
* **C: Ap jiitu kërup liggéeyukaayu gaas (The gas from the broken pipes)** - While gas is mentioned, it's presented as a *result* of the situation, not the initial cause.  The broken pipes are a consequence of the ""bad things"" happening.
* **D: Ap dëkkëndoo (The shopkeepers)** - The shopkeepers are mentioned as being affected, but not as the cause of the explosion.



"
Kan moo xamle took took gaas bi?,"The correct answer is **A: A dëkkëndoo (It is a shop)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ben apartema ca Macbeth Street defa lak ndax gas bu tojj. Ab njiit buy liggéey ak këru liggéeyukaay bu gaas bi dafa doon siiwal ab xew xew ba benn dëkkandoo wootee ngir ab gaas buy senn.""  This translates to: ""There is an apartment on Macbeth Street where clothes are sold. They sell new and used clothes, this shop is always open for people to buy clothes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nit ku dëkk ci apartemen bi (People who live in the apartment):** The passage focuses on what's *in* the apartment (a shop), not who lives there.
* **C: Ap njiitu këru liggéeukaayu gaas bi (They sell new and used clothes):** This describes *what* the shop does, not *what* the shop *is*.
* **D: Njaatige tabax bi (A cook's pot):** This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ñaata nit ño dee ci xeex bi?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions these individuals:

1. Nicolas Alden
2. Zachary Cuddeback
3. Edgar Veguilla
4. Kristofer Schneider

Therefore, there are four people mentioned in the text.
"
Kan la feteelam bañoon a fit ci benn waxtu ci diirub xeex bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Schneider**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Kristofer Schneider mom bay nañ ko mu nekk ci sirurgi defaraat kanamam."" (Kristofer Schneider had to undergo complex facial reconstruction surgery).  The question asks who had a procedure done to their face.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cuddeback:** The text says Cuddeback was injured, but doesn't say *he* had surgery.
*   **B: Uka:** Uka is mentioned as helping others, not receiving treatment.
*   **D: Alden:** Alden is only mentioned by name and age; there's no mention of any medical procedure.



"
Ban ci taagat yaraam yii toop la ñu taanulwoon ci programu Olympik bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ay tàggati yarami squash, karate ak patin jéem nañu duggu ci kaw porogaraamu Olympic ak baseball ak softball..."" This means squash, karate, and roller skating were being considered for addition to the Olympic program alongside baseball and softball.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rugby** - The text says rugby *is* included in the Olympics (""Rugby, Rawatina mboolo rugby, ak golf tànnoon nanu leen ci juróomi yneen tàggat yaram yu nu jàppon ngir ñu bkk ci jongante bi."").
*   **C: Baseball** - Baseball is mentioned as *already* being considered, not newly added.
*   **D: Karate** - While Karate is mentioned, Squash is the first one listed as being considered, making it the best answer to the question.



"
Ban ci taagat yaram yii toop la komite international bu Olympik bi wotewoon ngir boole leen ci së yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Taagat yaram ak rulër**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ay tàggati yarami squash, karate ak patin jéem nañu duggu ci kaw porogaraamu Olympic ak baseball ak softball, buñu wotewoon ci Jeu Olympiques bu 2005.""  This translates to ""Squash, karate and roller skating were added to the Olympic program with baseball and softball, which were voted on at the 2005 Olympic Games.""

Therefore, the passage is talking about sports *considered* for inclusion, making ""taagat yaram ak rulër"" (sports and rules) the best fit for what the IOC was voting on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Baseball:** Baseball was *already* part of the program being voted on, not what the IOC was considering.
*   **C: Mbooloom Rugby:** Rugby is mentioned as being *in* the games, not being considered.
*   **D: Bal bu nooy:** This is irrelevant to the text.



"
Arthur Guinness luwé na bu njëkk St James Gate Breweryngir ñaata àt?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bi ñu ci tegee 250 at, Guinness magg na doon ab liggéeyukaay bu mag buy jur 10 miliyaari oro (US$14,7 miliyaar) at mu nekk."" This translates to ""Today, it is valued at over 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) with 250 employees.""  The question asks about the *number* of employees at the beginning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 10** - This refers to billions of euros, not the number of employees.
*   **C: 1759** - This is the year Arthur Guinness signed the lease.
*   **D: 9000** - This is the initial lease amount in pounds."
Lu tool ci ñaata milyaaru dollars la Guinness di duggël àt bu nekk?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states: ""Guinness magg na doon ab liggéeyukaay bu mag buy jur **10 miliyaari** oro (US$14,7 miliyaar) at mu nekk.""  This translates to ""Guinness now has an annual revenue of over **10 billion** euros (US$14.7 billion).""

Therefore, the answer is 10."
Ci ñaata réew ci Union Européenne bi la ñu raññee doomu jangoro ji H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Juroom ñaar**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Faraas moy juróom ñaarelu dëkk ci mbootayu wa tugal bu loru ci doomu jàngoro bi; topusi Ótriis, Almaañ, Esloweeni, Bulgaari, Girees ak Itaali."" This translates to ""France is the fourth country to be affected by bird flu; including Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy.""
* **""Juroom ñaar""** means ""fourth country"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Juroom:**  Means ""first country"".
* **B: Juroom benn:** Means ""second country"".
* **D: Juroom ñeet:** Means ""third country"".



"
Fan la ñu raññeewoon kaa bu gëna bees ci doomu jangoro ji H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Faraas moy juróom ñaarelu dëkk ci mbootayu wa tugal bu loru ci doomu jàngoro bi"" which translates to ""France is the first country to report cases in poultry affected by the virus.""

Therefore, France is the country that first reported cases of H5N1 in poultry.
"
Kañ moo nekkoon àt bu mujj bu Haiti dajeewoon ak feebar bi balaa wal bu ñuy sàmm jamm indi?,"The correct answer is **C: Balaa yëngëtu suuf si**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bawoo ca Haiti li weesu Suuf su Yëngu su amoon ci atum 2010, dañ leen nekk di tuumal ni ñoom ñoo yokk feebar bi ci wetu barab yu turup yi daloon.""  This translates to: ""...the cholera that appeared in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, and it was determined that it was brought by the troops.""

Therefore, the cholera outbreak in Haiti was caused by **soldiers (the yëngëtu suuf)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: àtum 1800 bi (the year 1800):** The passage mentions Haiti had previous cholera outbreaks in the 1800s, but this wasn't the *source* of the recent outbreak.
* **B: Lu gaat balaa trup yi di ñëw (The soldiers just arrived):** While soldiers brought the cholera, the question asks about the *source* of the outbreak, not when they arrived.
* **D: Ci 2009 (In 2009):** The outbreak happened *after* the 2010 earthquake.



"
Mbalit yu bawoo fan ñu bokk ci li tax feebar bi gëna tasaaroo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kampema wu UN bi** (UN Camps).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sunu sukkndikoo ci porosé bi, mbaliiti kan bu mbootaayu xeet yi (UN) desinfektewu ñu leen woon bu baax, li nga xamantane mey wiris bi doole ngir mu duggu ci fi Dex gi di soteekoo, benn ci yi gëna mag ci Haïti.""  This translates to: ""Following the process, several UN camps were thoroughly disinfected, but unfortunately, the virus continued to spread, becoming one of the biggest problems in Haiti.""

The text directly links the spread of cholera to the UN camps. The other options are not mentioned as primary sources or locations of the cholera outbreak's spread in the text.



"
Lan la nguurup Irland di waaja def?,"The correct answer is **C: Yombal yoon yi jëm ci bayyi doroog yi san kondision**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Leegi am na solo lu ko dalé wergu yaaram askan wi ak wonin jëm ci yelleef faat nit ba sart bi am jexitaal bu gaaw...""  This translates to something like ""They have the right to benefit from the fruits of their labor and a fair share of the wealth created by people who have contributed skillfully.""
* **This directly relates to:**  Sharing the benefits of roads (doroog) and their associated conditions (kondision).  Yombal (sharing) aligns with the idea of a fair share.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Joxe ay àttee doom ñuy delinkaanwu doroog yi** (Some people have the right to destroy roads) - The passage doesn't mention destruction.
* **B: Tërël ay yoon yu gëna meti ci mbirum doroog yu ñu bayyi san kondision** (Free use of roads with bad conditions) - While conditions are mentioned, the focus isn't on free use, but on *benefit* from the roads.
* **D: Baña penaalise doroog** (Punishing roads) - This makes no sense in the context of the passage.



"
Lan moo legaaloon ci benn diir ci réewub Irland?,"The correct answer is **A: Sacc**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses a situation in Ireland where someone is being assaulted (""ngi fessal yakamati ci ab ndogalu pencu""). The quote ""Leegi am na solo lu ko dalé wergu yaaram askan wi ak wonin jëm ci yelleef faat nit ba sart bi am jexitaal bu gaaw"" describes hitting someone.  ""Sacc"" (meaning hitting/beating) is the most direct translation of this action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Frod** - This doesn't relate to physical assault.
*   **C: Agrese** - While aggression is involved, it's not the *act* being described.
*   **D: Doroog yi** - ""Doroog yi"" means thieves/robbers.  The passage describes a physical attack, not a robbery.



"
Lan la ku ñu foog ni moo tooñ def bañu koy laaj?,"The correct answer is **C: Vandalism**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes Christopher Garcia, a Los Angeles Police officer, responding to a situation where someone defaced property with paint.**  It specifically mentions ""tablo bi ci boppam yàquwul woon"" (the table was painted) and needing to investigate with ""ay bâche yu ñuul lañu jëfandikoo"" (paint cans).
* **Vandalism** is the deliberate destruction or damage of property. This directly aligns with the scenario described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jeegi dugg ci ap bërëp (Theft in a shop):** The passage doesn't mention anything about stealing.
* **B: Domaas ci jëm (Mistake in court):**  This is unrelated to the police officer and the defacement of property.
* **D: Sacci (Robbery):** Robbery involves taking something of value from a person, usually with force.  This isn't described in the passage.



"
"Ba muy sopi nataal bi, lan la suspé bi deful?","The correct answer is **C: Yàkk ko ci jëm**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ngir jël """"O"""" soppi ko muy """"e"""" bu ndaw."" This translates to ""...in order to change ""O"" to ""e"" with ease.""  Changing letters easily implies *writing* or *altering* them.
* **""Yàkk ko ci jëm""** means ""write it down"" or ""put it in writing."" This directly relates to changing the letter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sopi benn ci ay bataaxalam:** (It's a piece of advice) - The passage describes a *method*, not advice.
* **B: Dekoore ko ak ap nataalu jamm:** (Decorate it with beautiful letters) - The passage focuses on *changing* a letter, not decorating.
* **D: Jëfëndikoo ay baas ngir sopi ko:** (Find ways to write it) - While finding ways is part of the process, the direct action being described is changing the letter itself.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, ban ci yii toop la ñu daanulwoon tutër Angalé bi Karno?","The correct answer is **B: Di génne ak ap ndongo daara**.

Here's why:

The passage states Karno was arrested for illegally logging in Angalé forest and making around 9,000 dongo. It also mentions he was accused of *“jëfandikoo wax bu nu juutal ci bërëbu jàngukaay, jàngale na mënefu ndoxaan ci ay bind, te dafa melon ni xaritu ndongo yi kese.”*  This translates to ""illegal acts of cutting wood, damaging the environment in several ways, and wasting valuable wood.""  This directly relates to damaging the forest and resources – i.e., offenses related to forest/timber issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Infraksion droit dotër** - This is too general (""violation of the law"") and doesn't specify the nature of the violation.
*   **C: Di imprimé ay publicité yu ñu bayyiwul** - This means ""printing advertisements that are sold,"" and is completely unrelated to the context.
*   **D: Di jëfëndikoo ay kàllaama yu bon ci biir kalaas** - This means ""defamation or good words in a public class"" and is also irrelevant.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan la Rolando Mendoza japulwoon ni ap otaas?","The correct answer is **A: Ay tourist**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rolando Mendoza tire rafaalu na M16 am ci kaw turist yi."" This translates to ""Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 at the tourists.""  Therefore, he took hostages *of* the tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Alkaati yi** - This means ""the authorities"" - the text doesn't say he targeted them initially.
*   **C: Ay gone** - This doesn't make sense in the context of the passage.
*   **D: Ay fotokat** - This means ""the photographers"" - while photographers were present, they weren't the initial targets of the hostage situation.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu bind, ban otaas la ñu waxulwoon ni dañu leen a teela yeewi?","The correct answer is **A: Tourist yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rolando Mendoza tire rafaalu na M16 am ci kaw turist yi."" This translates to ""Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists.""  The question asks who was being held hostage, and the passage clearly identifies the tourists as the victims of the hostage situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Magget yi (Mag/relatives)** - While the passage mentions relatives, they weren't the primary targets or hostages.
* **C: Fotokat yi (Photographers)** - The passage mentions a Filipino photographer, but they were not the hostages.
* **D: Gone yi (People)** - This is too broad. The passage specifies *tourists*.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan mooy dajale ay siñaatuur ngir dimbëli legaalisé seyu ñu bokk awra ci Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Ñaxtukat yi** (The petitions).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xeexkat yakaar nagnu dajalé ben million ak niari temer mil ci ay siniatuur ngir woné ko ci National Congress bu Nowembar."" This translates to ""Petitions collected over a million and nearly ten thousand signatures to present to the National Congress in November.""  

The question asks what was collected to legalize same-sex civil unions in Brazil. The text clearly states it was the petitions (signatures).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as someone the bill was sent to, not the one who collected signatures.
*   **C: Jàngu Roomain Katolik bi:**  The Catholic Church is mentioned as being against the bill, not collecting signatures for it.
*   **D: Marta Suplicy:** She proposed the bill, but didn't collect the signatures.



"
Kan la ñaxtukat yi di jox petision bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Congres National bu Brézil**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""National Congress bu Brazil waxtaan na ci yoonal ngir fukki at, té seey yuni mél ci Rio Grande do Dul dong la dagan."" This directly translates to ""The National Congress of Brazil took a stand on the matter, and a few unions from Rio Grande do Sul supported it.""  The petition was brought *to* and dealt with by the National Congress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jàngu Roomain Katolik bi (Roman Catholic Church):** While the text mentions the Catholic Church's position, it wasn't the initiator of the petition.
* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He *received* the petition after it was initially suppressed, he didn't initiate it.
* **D: Méeru Sao Paulo (Mayor of São Paulo):** Marta Suplicy, the Mayor of São Paulo, proposed the law, but didn't initiate the petition itself.

"Jëm ci kontu Armand Versace, lan moo xew ci saas yi balaa mbooloo mi tambalee reasiir ci kilimaa bi?","The correct answer is **B: Afisaas bi yeexoon na juroomi simili**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""Juróomi simili ci wonin bi ab ngélaw di tambalee ngélaw..."" (Similar cars to his are causing accidents).  It then describes a fast car (""ngélaw li mu ngi àgg 70km/h..."") driven recklessly.  Armand Versace is speaking *about* these similar cars and the problems they cause.
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is Armand Versace concerned about in the story, relating to cars causing accidents?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dafa tambalee tawu galas (He bought expensive cars):** The passage doesn't say he *bought* the cars, only that similar cars are causing problems.
* **C: Amoon na ay ngelaw yu bare (He owns cheap cars):** The passage implies the cars are fast and potentially expensive, not cheap.
* **D: Amatulwoon benn xebaar jëm ci ap mbokku njaboot gi (He is involved in a scandal related to car accidents):** The passage doesn't say he's *involved* in the accidents, only that he's commenting on them.



Therefore, option **B** best reflects Armand Versace's concern about the dangerous driving associated with similar cars, as detailed in the passage."
"Jëm ci Versace, kañ la ngelaw yu gëna am doole tambale?","The correct answer is **A: Simili yu neew apare bu afisaas bi tambalee**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Juróomi simili ci wonin bi ab ngélaw di tambalee..."" which translates to ""Vehicles are similar to those of the police in ambulances...""  It directly connects the vehicles to being *similar to police vehicles in ambulances*.
* **Option A** (""Simili yu neew apare bu afisaas bi tambalee"" - ""The vehicles are new and appear like those of the police in ambulances"") perfectly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ba taw ji jeexee** (""Because the driver was speeding"") - While speeding is mentioned, it doesn't answer *what* the vehicles are similar to.
* **C: Ba mu ñàkkee jigéenam** (""Because he wanted to reach his destination"") - This refers to the driver's motivation, not the vehicles themselves.
* **D: Balaa tawu galaas gi di tambali** (""Because the glass in the ambulance"") - This focuses on a specific part of the ambulance and doesn’t relate to the overall similarity.



"
"Balaa Fred, ñaata taw yu magg la ñu bind yu am ci penku wu 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Ñeet** (Yes).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mooy ñatteelu ouragan bu mag buñ xam ci penku 35° Sowwu.""  This translates to ""...it is the first hurricane to be significantly observed in the 35°W zone.""

Therefore, Fred *is* the first major hurricane observed in that zone.  ""Ñeet"" means ""yes"" in Wolof.
"
"Ba Fred nekkoon ci wetu duni Cap Vert, ci ban yoon la jubluwoon?","The correct answer is **A: Sowu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tampet bi, nekk ci lu toll ci 646 mil (1040 km) ci **soowu** iilu Kap Weer..."" (The storm, located about 646 miles (1040 km) off the **west** of Cape Verde...).

The question asks where Fred was located near Cape Verde. The text directly states it was off the *west* (sowu) of Cape Verde.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo gëna am wites ay naatangoom yu ko jiitu?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Gaawayu 802.11n ño gënee gaaw lool yi ko jiitu ak lumu gaaw gaaw ci 600Mbit/s.""  This translates to ""802.11n can achieve very high speeds with a maximum speed of 600Mbit/s.""  The question asks which standard has the highest speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **802.11b:**  The text mentions it as an older standard.
* **802.11g:** The text mentions it as an older standard.
* **802.11a:** The text mentions it as an older standard.

Therefore, 802.11n is the only option presented that's described as having high speeds.



"
Lan moo am njariñ ngir 802.11n ngir nekk retrokompatibal ak 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Radio dubbal**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Normu 802.11n muy dox ci ñaari ferekans yi 2.4Ghz ak 5.0Ghz."" (The 802.11n standard uses two frequency bands: 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz).  This means 802.11n devices have *dual-band radios* to support both frequencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wites yu gëna gaaw:** (Speeds that are fast) - While 802.11n *is* faster, the question is about compatibility, not speed.
* **B: Kàttanu 802.11b ngir jëf ci 5.0Ghz:** (Cutting 802.11b to work on 5.0Ghz) - 802.11b doesn't operate on 5.0Ghz.  It uses 2.4Ghz.  And the goal is *compatibility*, not removing support.
* **C: Ap wàññi wu 600Mbit/s:** (A speed of 600Mbit/s) - This is a speed capability of 802.11n, but doesn't explain how it maintains compatibility with older standards.



Therefore, the ability to operate on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies (dual-band radio) is how 802.11n achieves backward compatibility with 802.11b, which only uses 2.4Ghz."
Ñaata xew xew la ku am medaayu wurus bi ci féey ca sëwu Commonwealth ya bokkoon?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñeet**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Medaay dooru Olympik bi dañ teggoon ngir feey ci 100m ak 200 feey bi amul luñuy tere ak ñatti relé ci Jeux yu Commonwealth..."" (The Olympic medalist competed in the 100m and 200m, and a relay at the Commonwealth Games...)
* **The question asks:** Has the medalist competed in the Commonwealth Games before?
* Since the passage *states* they competed in the Commonwealth Games, the answer is **Yes (Ñeet)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Juroom (No)** - The passage contradicts this.
* **C: Ñaar (Maybe)** - The passage is definite about their participation.
* **D: Ñeent (Never)** - The passage contradicts this.



"
Lu tax ku am medaayu dooru Olympik ba daanul woon jël garab ngir metitam?,"The correct answer is **A: Amulwoon benn metit**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""P: Medaay dooru Olympik bi dañ teggoon ngir feey ci 100m ak 200 feey bi amul luñuy tere ak ñatti relé ci Jeux yu Commonwealth, waaye ak mettit yimuy daan yëg dañoo amoon ay sikki-sakka ci wergu-yaramam.""  This translates to: ""He won Olympic medals for running in the 100m and 200m, was very good at running and a member of the relay team in the Commonwealth Games, but with his titles, he didn't get any recognition in his country.""
* **The question asks:** Who won Olympic medals to be forgotten for recognition?
* **Option A (""Amulwoon benn metit"")** directly answers this question - he won medals (is a medalist).
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * B:  Doesn't relate to medals or recognition.
    * C: Talks about being unappreciated, but doesn't confirm he *won* anything.
    * D: Mentions Commonwealth Games, but the question is specifically about *Olympic* medals.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, lan moo mënoona yoobu ci jaaxle jëm ci jëfi yëngu yëngu suuf?","The correct answer is **B: Rapoor yu jogee ci bërëpu liggéeyukaayu meteo bu Island** (Reports issued by the Icelandic Meteorological Office).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Biro bu Jangale ci wàllum Meteo ci Islànd xamle na itam ni amul lenn luñuy def ci wàllu yëngu-yëngu suuf ci barabu Hekla..."" (The Jangale office at the Meteo in Iceland reported that there is a possibility of ash fall in the area around the Hekla volcano...)
* This directly indicates the source of information about the volcanic activity and ash fall is the Icelandic Meteorological Office's reports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Téewaayu ay niir yu lëndëm** (The presence of unusual gases) - While the passage mentions gases, it doesn't state this *is* what's being reported. It's a *part* of the observation.
* **C: Kartu yëngu-yëngu suuf ci àdduna bi** (Maps of ash fall around the world) - The passage focuses on Iceland and Hekla, not a global map.
* **D: Jëfin yu ñu nemeeku ci yeneeni bërëpu Island** (Definitions created by Icelandic experts) - The passage is about *reports* of activity, not the *creation of definitions*.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ la ap faasu copite di dikk?","The correct answer is **C: Ca Mars 10**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ay yëngu-yëngu suuf yu am solo te li ko waral mooy coppite yi amoon ci bisu 10 mars wall wi féete nord-est collu volcan caldeira.""  This translates to: ""These solo sulfur springs, their origin is the gases emitted around March 10th, towards the northeast of the hot caldera volcano.""

Therefore, the gases (and thus the springs) appeared *around* March 10th.  ""Ca Mars 10"" means ""around March 10th.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Balaa Mars 10** - ""Balaa"" means ""on"" - the text doesn't say *on* March 10th, but *around* that time.
*   **B: CI 48 waxtu yu jaal** - This refers to the time frame for potential eruptions at Hekla, not the origin of the springs.
*   **D: Ci ayu bës bu jiitu** - This refers to when the sulfur springs were found during the expedition, not when they originated.



"
Ban ci baat yii toop jëm ci Chandrayaan-1 la sondu wéeram dëgguwul?,"The correct answer is **B: Sond bi gadduwoon na ay jëmtukaay yu am solo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Dolli ci yóbbu ñetti jumtukaayu xam-xam yu am solo, fafalnaaw bi jëm ci jawwu ji yóbbu na tamit natalu raaya bu Indë...""  This translates to ""It carried several advanced sensors, including those for observing the lunar surface in detail, which were developed by Indian scientists...""  This directly indicates the probe had sensors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Orbitër bi taal sond bi amoon na ap ekipaas:** The passage doesn't mention an orbiter or equipment. It focuses on the *impact probe* (MIP).
* **C: Sandiwu sond bi nekkoon na ap ndam:** The passage doesn't say the probe landed softly or had any form of landing apparatus.  It *impacted* the moon.
* **D: Sond bi amoon na ay wet yu ñu def ay melo:**  While the probe *collected* data, the passage doesn't describe it having specific ""wetu"" (things/objects) to measure.  It focuses on sensors for *observing* the surface.



"
Ban ci baat yii toop ñooy wone bu baax sondu wéer bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Dafa dal ci wetu poolu bët-gànnaaru Wéer gi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...bu dal ci weer bi ci 1,5 kilomeetar saala bu nekk (3000 kilomeetar waxtu wu nekk), te teer ak ndam ci wetu polu bët saaalum bu weer bi."" This translates to ""...which fell into the Moon at a distance of 1.5 kilometers (3000 kilometers later), and landed in the southern pole region of the Moon.""
* **Option A** directly reflects this information – it states the probe fell into the southern pole region of the Moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dalam ci suuf nekk na ak ndam:** This means ""Fell in the south and landed,"" but the passage specifies the *southern pole* region, which is more precise.
* **C: Dañu ko sandeewoon ci ap orbitër bu ñu dëkkël:** This means ""They launched it from an orbiter as they observed,"" which is not what the passage describes.  The MIP *impacted* the Moon, it wasn't launched from an orbiter.
* **D: Dafa gadduwoon ñaari jumtukaay yu am solo lool:** This means ""They were the first solo probes to fall,"" which isn't the main point of the passage. The passage focuses on *where* it fell.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci lu ñu wax, ban faanu kaaraange ngir jangoro bi la ñuy mujjee tërël?","The correct answer is **A: Poson yi** (Vaccines).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Li ñu jotoon a tëral ngir yóbbu ñaq yi (vaccin) ci barab yi feebar bi gënee bari...""  This directly translates to ""They are looking to create treatments for diseases (vaccines) to prevent the fever from spreading...""

The question asks what is being considered to help control the fever. The passage clearly identifies vaccines as the proposed solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Luy japp mbaam xuux yi** (The suffering of the children) - While the passage mentions suffering, it doesn't propose this *as a solution*.
* **C: Ñakku encephalite** (Encephalitis disease) - Encephalitis is *caused* by the fever, not a solution to it.
* **D: Ay sanke yoo** (Some errors) - This isn't mentioned as a potential solution in the text.



"
Naka la feebar bi di waalee nit ñi?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbaam xuux yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fébar bi ay mbaam xuux ñokoy joxé, yooyi ñookoy jox nitt ñi.""  This translates to ""The fever is caused by many children, some cause illness in others.""  Therefore, children (mbaam xuux) are identified as the source or carriers of the fever.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yoo yi** - ""They"" - This is too vague and doesn't pinpoint the cause.
*   **B: Poson yi** - ""Animals"" - The text doesn't mention animals as the cause.
*   **D: Luy japp mbaam xuux yi** - ""Some children"" - While the text mentions *some* children cause illness, it's broader than just *some*; the fever *is* caused by many children.



"
Lajju ñaareelu baat bi mën na yoobu ci ban mujjëntalu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ap gëstuwaatu HJR-3 bu gaaw** (They managed HJR-3 successfully).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Li topp ci doxaliin wi, dina ñu saytuwaat HJR-3 sera ci beneen luwa buñu fal ci atum 2015 wala 2016 ngir mu nekk luy wey."" This translates to ""According to the document, they managed to pass HJR-3 before the deadline of 2015 or 2016 for it to take effect.""  This directly indicates successful management of HJR-3.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay aaku mbooloo ñu bokk awra ëlëg:** (They only had a little time left) - The passage doesn't focus on time constraints, but on *achieving* passage.
* **C: Ap sesion legislativ ci bu gaaw:** (They had a successful legislative session) - While this might be true, the passage specifically highlights the success with *HJR-3*, making A more precise.
* **D: Tere uñon sivilu ñu bokk awra:** (Civil unions were passed) - The passage is about HJR-3, not civil unions. HJR-3 itself likely *concerned* civil unions, but wasn't the act of passing them.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kañ la ñu dindiwoon ñaareelu baat bi?","The correct answer is **C: Ci Altiné**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bénn coppité amoonna ci pégncum ndaw rééwmi bi gnaaréélu baat biko House of Representatives yi génné té jall ci bu mélnonu ci Senate Altiné.""  This translates to ""A committee approved the bill after it passed the House of Representatives and then moved to the Senate **in Altiné**.""

Therefore, the bill was considered in Altiné. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ci diirub sesion legislative bi** - While legislative sessions are implied, the text doesn't specifically mention *when* during a session it happened.
*   **B: Ci 2011** - 2011 is the year the events *began*, not where the action of considering the bill took place.
*   **D: Ci 2015** - 2015 refers to a potential future date for final action, not the initial consideration.



"
Ci kan la “Kayitu Panama” yi senoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Kërup liggéeyukaayu Mossack Fonseca** (The law firm Mossack Fonseca).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Keyiti Panama"""" ab diiru parasol la ngir lu jege fukki miliyoŋi wayndare yu bawoo ci kabinet awoka bu Panama buñuy woowee **Mossack Fonseca**...""  This translates to ""The 'Panama Papers' refer to millions of documents leaked from the Panamanian law firm **Mossack Fonseca**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Press bi (The press):** The press *reported* on the Panama Papers, but they weren't the source.
* **C: Bank Ollandaise (Dutch Bank):** While Deutsche Bank is mentioned, the papers themselves originated from a law firm, not a bank.
* **D: Njiitu nguuru Islande (Icelandic leaders):** Icelandic leaders were *involved* due to the papers, but they weren't the source of the leak.

"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan la press Britanique bi wax ni moo doon topatoo yu bare ci këru liggéeyukaay yu doon nëb alal gi?","The correct answer is **B: Këru liggéeyukaayu yoon ci Panama**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Keyiti Panama...buñuy woowee Mossack Fonseca, buñu feeñal ci xibaar yi printemps 2016.""  This directly links the leak to companies in Panama (specifically Mossack Fonseca) and the spring of 2016.  The question asks what the British press reported about the leaked information. The passage indicates the leak involved companies *in* Panama.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kiliyaan yu am alal yu nekk ci ay bank yu wuute:** While the text mentions money being held in banks, it doesn't specifically state the British press focused on *which* banks held the money, just that there were billions of dollars involved.
* **C: Bank Ollandaise:** The text doesn't mention Dutch banks.
* **D: Nguurup Pakistan:** While Pakistan is mentioned as a country where people involved used the firms, it isn't the *focus* of what the British press reported *about the leak itself*.

Weer wii weesu Iran dund na jëye ji gëna mettii ci wàllu fafalndaaw bu daanu ba benn fafalndaaw bu doon dem Armeni daanoo...""  This translates to: ""Later in the day, the helicopters that had returned were carrying people and a lot of bodies. The news from Iran stated that they were searching for the wreckage of the plane that came from Armenia...""

This clearly indicates the accident involved a plane *coming from* Armenia *to* Iran.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Daanub elikopteeru alkaati yi** - The text mentions helicopters *after* the crash, used for rescue/recovery, not as the vehicle involved in the accident.
* **C: Daanub ropalaan bu doon dem Iran jogee ca Armenie** - The text states the opposite - it was coming *from* Armenia.
* **D: Daanub ropalaan ba ca Mashhad** - Mashhad is a city where some of the bodies were taken, it wasn't the location of the accident.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo dul lu waral aksidenwu ay ropalaan yu baree bare yu am ci Iran?,"The correct answer is **A: Ap flotu ay ropaalaan sivil ak militeer yu magget**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...lu ëpp ci roppalaanu saldaar ak tukki yi dañu màgget."" This directly translates to ""...many military and civilian planes crashed.""  The passage focuses on the *crash* of planes (aksidenwu).
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ñàkkub budse ngir jënd ay ropalaan yu bees:** The passage doesn't mention a lack of support for planes.
    * **C: Sanksion yuy tere njëndub ropalaan yu bees:** The passage doesn't mention sanctions.
    * **D: Ap topatoo bu baaxul bu flotu ay ropalaan:** The passage describes crashes, not a good situation regarding flights.

This translates to ""The report states that Kenn believes the situation in Iraq is extremely dangerous, either leading to war, or lacking permission from the authorities."" This directly points to concerns about potential conflict/instability in Iraq.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñgaññu yoon yu ñu tërël ci waxtu gii:** (Those who are interested in the time) - This is irrelevant to the content of the report.
* **C: Xelalu aar diggu Irak yi:** (The mistakes of past Iraqs) - The passage focuses on the *current* and *potential future* situation, not past mistakes.
* **D: Ap pleduwayee ngir ap konsensus Americain:** (Pressure for American consensus) - While the passage mentions the US, the primary focus isn't about pressure for American consensus but rather the internal Iraqi situation and potential conflict.



"
Ban ci yii toop la guruup gëstu bu Irak bi junjul ci rapooram?,"The correct answer is **C: Jëfëndikoo ay waxtaan yu ubbeeku** (Advocating for inclusive governance).

This translates to ""The stated goal is to work for inclusive governance and dialogue within the framework of the interests of the United States and the policies of the Biden administration.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ni ñu wax ap garaanti muy dagal fitna mii di yokku** (If they offer guarantees that the conflict will end) - The passage doesn't focus on guarantees for ending conflict, but on *how* Iraq is governed.
* **B: Ap copite yoon ci bu gaaw** (Copying a position from the majority) -  The passage doesn't mention copying positions.
* **D: Samp ap inisiativ diplomatik bu bees** (Launching a new diplomatic initiative) - While diplomacy is mentioned, the primary focus isn't *launching* an initiative, but promoting a specific type of governance.



"
"Jëm ci lu poliis wax, kan la ñu jappeewoon ni ndeyjooru loxo wu Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Waa Police wax nañu ci mëna luñu dara Lo Piccolo ndax dafa jege woon lool Provenzano ca Palermete..."" This translates to ""Police say Lo Piccolo was very close to Provenzano in Palermo...""  This clearly indicates Lo Piccolo had a close relationship with Provenzano, making him the subject of police interest related to Provenzano.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Giovanni Falcone & Paolo Borsellino:** They were *victims* of the Mafia, not people investigating Provenzano directly in this context.
*   **Ansa:** Ansa is a news agency, not a person involved in the police investigation.



"
"Di sukkëndiku ci xebaar bu ñu joxe ci lu ñu wax, lan moo indiwoon deewu Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Dañu ko réeyoon ci xareeg Riina-driven**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njiit yi Provenzano moolén fi ték bimu jéxalé xééxu Riina-bi nu jiital ak réew bi beeggona jeel dunduk Mafia yi Giovanni Falcone ak Paolo Borsellino ci atum 1992.""  This directly translates to ""Provenzano's men wanted to avenge Riina, who was killed and the state took the lives of Mafia leaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.""

This indicates Falcone's death was a result of actions connected to and motivated by Riina. Therefore, he was killed in the wake of Riina's downfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Poliis a ko réyoon:** The passage doesn't say police killed Falcone. It states the *state* took his life, meaning through actions related to the Mafia conflict, but not a direct police action.
* **C: Lo Piccolo la ñu santoon mu réy ko:**  Lo Piccolo is mentioned in relation to Provenzano but not as directly involved in Falcone’s death.
* **D: Beneen mbokku Mafia Paolo Borsellino moo ko réyoon:** While Borsellino was also killed, the passage doesn't indicate *he* killed Falcone. They were both victims.



"
Ban ci yii toop moo bokkul ci benn ci ràññële wu Hitoshi Saito yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñaari yoon Medaay dooru Olympik** (Won an Olympic medal).

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""amoon ñaari medaay dor olympique"" (won an Olympic medal). This is a direct fact mentioned in the passage about Hitoshi Saito.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñaari yoon Champion modial (Won a world championship):** While the text mentions Saito was a world champion, the question asks about *what he was known for* based on the passage, and the Olympic medal is stated first.
* **B: Seefu komite ngir federaasion judo Japonees yi yëpp (Served on the committee for the Japanese Judo Federation):** This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Ekspeer judo (Judo expert):** While implied, it's not explicitly stated as a defining characteristic mentioned in the passage.



"
Fan la Iwasaki jeemee daw di def ay digge?,"The passage (P) states: ""Iwasaki dafa jokkonteeg ak coow ci anam yu bare. ... rëc sëy ca Nepal te nu jàpp ko ca Indë."" This translates to ""Iwasaki comes from a rich family. ... he first went to Nepal then traveled to India.""

The question (Q) asks: ""Fan la Iwasaki jeemee daw di def ay digge?"" which translates to ""From which country does Iwasaki originally come?""

Since the passage only mentions he *comes from a rich family* and then travels *from Nepal to India*, it doesn't directly state his country of origin. However, the name ""Iwasaki"" is a Japanese surname. Therefore, the most logical answer is **A: Japon (Japan)**.

While he *traveled through* Nepal and India, those aren't his original home.



"
Kan moo songoon Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ay pirat**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states: ""Ay pirate ñoko sacc, xaj bu soxor songu ko ca Tibet..."" (A pirate once went, who travelled from Tibet...)
* **Q (the question)** asks: ""Kan moo songoon Iwasaki?"" (Where did Iwasaki travel?)
* The passage directly links Iwasaki's travel to being with a pirate who journeyed from Tibet. Therefore, ""Ay pirat"" (A pirate) is the most relevant and accurate answer, as it introduces the context of Iwasaki's journey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku muy fooga seyal:** This doesn't relate to the passage.
* **C: Ap xaj:** While ""xaj"" is mentioned, it's simply stating *that* he travelled, not *where* he travelled from.
* **D: Alkaati:** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Kañ la Alonso tej dawam?,"The correct answer is **C: Ba Schumacher tejee dowam**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Michael Schumacher *jeexal na rawanteem laata Alonso di ko def* (criticized Alonso's late race). This implies Schumacher believes Alonso did something wrong. Therefore, the question ""What did Alonso do?"" is best answered by saying Schumacher thinks he made a mistake (""Ba Schumacher tejee dowam"" - Schumacher thinks he's wrong).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ba Schumacher yakkee pono kanamam** - This translates to ""Schumacher doesn't care about his position."" The passage doesn't focus on Schumacher's feelings about Alonso's position.
* **B: Fisichella ñàkkee njiitu wotoom** - This translates to ""Fisichella took a wrong turn.""  While Fisichella is mentioned, the question is about Alonso.
* **D: Balaa muy jël njiit li** - This translates to ""It's very difficult to take a turn."" This is a general statement and doesn't relate to Alonso's actions specifically.



"
Lu waral Schumarcher jeexal dowam ci bu teel?,"The correct answer is **B: Ap aksiden ak Alonso**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher jeexal na rawanteem laata Alonso di ko def, ndax sukkandikukaay yu yàkku ci xeex yu bare yi ci biir rawante gi.""  This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher lost the race to Alonso because of an accident with him, due to strong contact in the difficult part of the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dafa ñàkk njiitu wotoom:** (He had a problem with the engine) - The text doesn't mention engine trouble for Schumacher.
*   **C: Yakkute pono bu Fisichella indi:** (He didn't take advantage of Fisichella's mistake) - The text focuses on the incident with Alonso, not a missed opportunity with Fisichella.
*   **D: Domaasu suspensionwu woto bi:** (He damaged his suspension) - The text doesn't mention any suspension damage.



"
"Jëm ci lu ñu bind, kan la liggéeyam di fiksé kosion ngir nit yu ñu japp?","The correct answer is **C: Sentaraalu reservasion bi** (Central reservation).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...bàyyi nañu leen centrale de réservation waaye tegu ñu leen benn daan."" (They sent them to the central reservation so they could help them).  This directly indicates the central reservation is responsible for fixing issues for people traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alkaati miy jappaate** (The person who traveled) - The passage doesn't say this person fixes anything.
* **B: Juus Glynn** (Judge Glynn) - Judge Glynn only *heard* the case, he didn't fix the travel issues.
* **D: Komiseeru àttekaay ba** (The chief commissioner) -  While mentioned, the passage focuses on the practical help coming from the central reservation.



"
"Jëm ci ordonaansu teye bu di ngir ap diir bu gaat ci lu ñu bind, lan la nit yu ñu japp wara am ngir ñu teye leen lu ëp 24 waxtu?","The correct answer is **C: Yeneeni saars yu Juus Glynn bind**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci weeru avril ci at mii, juge Glynn jël na dogal buy tere ñu dugg ci barab bi Glynn ngir fexe ñu génne ñi ñu tëye lu weesu 24 waxtu ginaaw bi ñu leen fa dugalee te kenn woowaatu leen ngir ñu àtte leen.""  This directly translates to ""In April of this year, Judge Glynn ordered that they open a bar at Glynn's to accommodate those who arrive late and can't find a place to stay for the 24 hours they need, and to provide them with what they need to rest.""

* **The question asks:** What was done to accommodate the 80 people who arrived late and needed a place to stay for 24 hours?

* **Option C** accurately reflects this - Judge Glynn's order resulted in opening his bar to provide shelter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kosyon (Deposit):** The passage doesn't mention any deposits.
* **B: Ap ndaje ak alkaati bu leen japp (Appointment and reservation):** While there's mention of a central reservation, the specific solution for the late arrivals wasn't a reservation.
* **D: Ap ojaans (An offer):** The passage describes an *order* from a judge, not a voluntary offer.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, ban sabab lañu jëfandikoowul ngir leeral palum njiit buñu fomm?","The correct answer is **B: Ab wuutee ci konstitsioŋ bi** (Problems within the constitution).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Diplomat yi neena ñu gis nañu ci konstitusiyong Afghan ay lëndëm lëndëm yu doy ngir wax ne jongante jaru ko."" (Diplomats are looking at the Afghan constitution and specific articles that allow for interpretations that are harmful to the country).  This directly points to issues *within* the constitution as the source of the problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Risku Kaarange:** While risk of interference is mentioned, it's a *result* of the constitutional issues, not the root cause.
* **C: Depans yu ëpp:**  Dependence is mentioned, but it's a broader context, not the specific problem causing the potential harm.
* **D: Ñaka leer gi am ci konstitisioŋ bi:**  The *presence* of articles in the constitution isn't the problem; the *interpretations* of those articles are.



"
Lu tax dipolomat yi jàppoon ni ñaareelu pal gi lu ñakka solo la?,"The correct answer is **C: Dafa amoon ab lëndëm-lëndëm ci konstitisioŋ bi** (They found ambiguities in the constitution).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Diplomat yi neena ñu gis nañu ci konstitusiyong Afghan ay lëndëm lëndëm yu doy ngir wax ne jongante jaru ko."" This translates to ""The diplomats found ambiguities in the Afghan constitution that give room for different interpretations.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dafa wuute woon ak konstitisioŋ bi** (They agreed with the constitution) - The passage says they *found issues* with it, not that they agreed.
* **B: Dafa amoom a risku kaarànge** (They encountered a risk of conflict) - While disagreement *could* lead to conflict, the passage focuses on the *reason* for the disagreement (ambiguities).
* **D: Pal mi dafa seeroon lool** (The situation is very serious) - While the situation might *be* serious, the passage doesn't directly state that; it focuses on the *finding* of the diplomats.



"
Kan mooy jox FATA ay sàrwiisi yoon?,"The correct answer is **C: Njiitu réewi Pakistan** (The Government of Pakistan).

Here's why:

The passage states that after independence in 1947, the Pakistani government (njiitu réewum Pakistan) took over the administration of FATA (formerly under British rule) and introduced ""political agencies"" to manage it. The question asks what took over the administration of FATA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nguuru Pakistan bi** (The State of Pakistan) - While related to the government, it's the *government* that performs the administrative action.
*   **B: Ndawal Polotik yi** (The Political Agencies) - These were *created by* the government to administer FATA, they didn't take over from the British.
*   **D: Nguuru Biritanik bi** (The British State) - The passage states they *relinquished* control, they didn’t continue it.



"
Ban ci yile wax yu àju ci kaddu “Ndawal Polotik” yu FARA moo dul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **B: Njiitu Réewu Pakistan bi mo leen tànn** (The Government of Pakistan which established them).

Here's why:

The passage states the ""Political Agents"" were created by the government of Pakistan to administer FATA.  The question asks what created the ""Political Agents"" of FATA. Therefore, the government of Pakistan is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañuy joxe ay sàrwiisi yoon (Some union service)** - This is unrelated to the creation of the Political Agents.
* **C: Dañoo duggal seen bopp ci konstitisioŋ bu Pakistan (They are mentioned in the Pakistan Constitution)** - While Article 247 of the constitution *relates* to FATA, it doesn't *create* the Political Agents. It governs the area, and they are part of the administration within that governance.
* **D: Dañoo amal saytu gu mat ci yenn barab yi (They carry out important tasks in different areas)** -  This describes their *function*, not their origin.



"
Ci ban prix lañu nommé woon Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Fentkat bi gëna aay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tabë nañu Gosling ak Stone ci Acteur ak Actrice yu gena rañeku."" which translates to ""Both Gosling and Stone are excellent Actors and Actresses."" This implies Emma Stone is recognized for her acting performance in the film.  Option C, ""Fentkat bi gëna aay"" (the actress is good) directly relates to this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fentkat ci ab ñaareel rôle:** While she might have a leading role, the text doesn't specifically mention *how* she's nominated.
*   **B: Réalisateur bi gëna aay:** The text doesn't mention anything about the director being good.
*   **D: Ki gëna ay si montage film:** The text doesn't relate Emma Stone to film editing/montage.



"
Ci ban prix lañu nomminéwul film bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Nataal bi gën** (Best Original Song).

The text specifically mentions ""Nataal bi gën"" (Original Song) among the categories the film is nominated for. The other options (visual effects, music mixing, and costume design) are not explicitly listed as nominations in the provided text.



"
Ban ci yile mo nekk di dox bi yëngu-yëngu suuf si jàllee?,"The correct answer is **A: Reacteur yu nekk ci centrale Hokuriku Shika bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. waxnani amul bénn laalé ci suuf su yeengu si té bénn ak gnaarélu beereebu nuclear bu Shika power teej na gnuko.""  This directly translates to ""Hokuriku Electric Power Co. is currently concerned about the safety of the Shika nuclear power plant.""
* **The question asks:** About what is being worried about in the investigation?
* **Therefore:** The reactors at the Hokuriku Shika plant are the focus of the safety concerns and investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aydapoor bu nekk Ishikawa (Noto Airport in Ishikawa):** While mentioned as affected by the earthquake, it's not the *focus* of the safety investigation.
* **C: sàrwiisi raay yépp (certain services):** Too vague and not directly related to the central topic.
* **D: Ab isinu kuraŋ ci Niigata (damaged homes in Niigata):** While damage is mentioned, it's a consequence of the earthquake, not the primary concern driving the investigation of the power plants.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile moo am ay yaxu-yaxu ndax suuf su yëngu?","The correct answer is **A: Ay kër**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amna xibaar bu xamle ni li amna 9400 kër yu taa ci gox bii te itam amna lu wara tollu ci 100 kër yu amul kuuraŋ.""  This translates to ""The report shows that there are 9400 houses in the affected area, and also about 100 houses that are damaged.""  The question asks what was damaged in the area, and the passage specifically mentions houses (""kër"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ñaari réacteurs ci centrale bu Shika:** While the passage mentions the Shika power plant, it doesn't say the *reactors* were damaged.
* **C: Ay tali:** The passage doesn't mention anything about roads (tali).
* **D: Ayeropoor bu Noto:**  The passage mentions the Noto airport was closed, but doesn't say it was damaged.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile jafe-jafe lañu dugalul ci wayndare bi?","The correct answer is **A: Ëllëgu Jerusalem** (The question of Jerusalem).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yenen tomb yuñu waxtaanee ñooy réew Jerusalem buñuy waaja sos biñu jox raaya ñaari réew yi ak mbirum Vallée bu Sordani."" (One of the main issues is the question of the city of Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides and the West Bank of the Jordan Valley.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Li waral geeru 1967** (What happened in 1967) - While the passage mentions 1967, it doesn't frame *what* happened as the central issue. It uses 1967 as a historical reference point for current disputes.
* **C: Teewaayi militeer yi ci Vallée bi** (Military forces in the Valley) -  The passage mentions military presence, but doesn't present it as the core conflict.
* **D: Ñaka jubboo gi am ci foroñceer yi** (The problems that exist in the territories) - This is too broad. The passage focuses specifically on Jerusalem.



"
Ban ci yile moo nekkul benn ci càkkutéefi Palestine?,"The correct answer is **D: Ab teewaayu militeer bu toll ci juróomi at ci Vallée bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Israel dafay sàkku teewaayu takk der yi ci vale gi ci diru fukki at sunu xaatime deggoo gi fekk PA bi ndangu jóge tewwaay bu ni mel ci juroomi at rekk."" This translates to ""Israel occupies territories in the valley and its immediate surroundings, including the areas ceded to the PA in the Oslo agreements, but only in the occupied territories."" This directly refers to military occupations in the territories (including the Jordan Valley) and the occupied areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Foroñceer yu àju ci ay anami li jiitu geer bi:** (Fronts that are opened on several sides of the war) - The passage doesn't focus on multiple fronts of war, but on occupation.
* **B: Teewaayu militeer buy wey ci Vallée bu Jordanie:** (Military forces that exist in the Jordan Valley) - While true, the passage emphasizes *occupation* by Israel, not just the presence of forces.
* **C: Tontu yu àju ci ëllëgu Jerusalem:** (Areas opened in the area of Jerusalem) - The passage mentions Jerusalem but focuses on the broader occupation of territories.

This translates to: ""Ma was born in Hong Kong, Ma went to school in New York and Harvard University and had an American friend who gave him a very valuable card in that country. He later regretted not visiting that country more often.""

Therefore, Ma spent significant time and had a connection to the United States of America.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ndimbalu ban réew moo jàpp ci ndam li Ma am ci pal mi?","The correct answer is **A: Etats-unis bu Amerig (United States of America)**.

This translates to: ""Ma practiced Judo in Hong Kong, then went to New York and Harvard University and had an American friend who gave him a valuable card in that country.” He later realized he had lost that country over time. 

The text clearly indicates Ma had a connection to the *United States* through a friend and a valuable card received *in that country*.  The question asks which country Ma had a connection with.
"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, kan la Carolyn Wilson daan liggéeyal laata muy joge ci dëkk bi?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...njaboot yu bari yu ci bokk gis nañu ci saasi ni Carolyn Wilson bu **OHA** dafa sàcc xaalis biñu dugaloon ngir garanti ba noppi mu daw genn réew mi.""

This translates to: ""...the evicted families were put in touch with Carolyn Wilson of **OHA** who is working to find legal help for them to guarantee their right to remain in the country.""

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson works for OHA and is helping the families. The question asks what Carolyn Wilson is associated with, and OHA is the correct answer.

"Ci ñeenti rawante yu des ci pàcc bi, kan moo jël ñeenteelu palaas bi ci Championnat dawalkati roplaan yi?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci ñatteelu palaas bi, rawee nañu Hamlin ñaar fukki poñ, waaye rawee na Bowyer juróomi poñ."" This translates to: ""In third place, Hamlin was awarded 6 points, but Bowyer was awarded 7 points.""

The question asks who finished in *tenth* place in the championship. The text specifically says Bowyer received 7 points, which is the number associated with finishing tenth in the championship. While Hamlin finished higher, he didn't get the points for tenth place.



"
"Li topp ci rawantane bi ñu def ci xët bi, ñaata poñ la Kahne am ci Championnat dawalkati roplaan yi?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The question asks for Kahne's points, which are stated as 2220."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ñaata yoon la nit ñi fekee daanu metoworit yuy mujjee nekk yu bawoo ci planet mars?","The correct answer is **C: Fukk ak juróomi yoon**.

* **The passage states:** ""Daanako ci 24 000 météorite yi ñu xamni ñoo daanu ci kaw suuf, 34 kese lañu dëggalagul ni ñoo ci jogee planete mars."" (Among the 24,000 meteorites found on Earth, 34 were identified as originating from the planet Mars.)
* **The question asks:** What is known about the stones found by people that came from the planet Mars?
* **""Fukk ak juróomi yoon""** translates to ""Stones and meteorites,"" which directly relates to the passage's information about meteorites originating from Mars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fukki yoon (Stones only):** While the meteorites *are* stones, the passage specifically mentions them *as* meteorites, making ""stones only"" incomplete.
* **B: Juróomi yoon (Meteorites only):** The passage focuses on stones *found* to be from Mars, not just meteorites in general.
* **D: Fanuweer ak ñeenti yoon (Findings and counting):** This doesn't directly address what is *known* about the stones themselves.

"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, lan mooy li am dëgg ci xeer yuñu gis ni ci planet mars lañu cosaanoo?","The correct answer is **D: 34 ñoo ci am**.

* **The text states:** ""Daanako ci 24 000 météorite yi ñu xamni ñoo daanu ci kaw suuf, 34 kese lañu dëggalagul ni ñoo ci jogee planete mars.""  This translates to: ""Of the 24,000 meteorites found on Earth, 34 were identified as being from the planet Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  This is too general and doesn't answer the specific question about Mars.
* **B:**  24,000 is the *total* number of meteorites found, not just those from Mars.
* **C:** This refers to the price/value of the meteorites, not the number from Mars.



"
Kañ la Schumacher bayyi?,"The correct answer is **C: Bimu jëlee palaasu Felipe Massa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states ""dafa waroon jël palaasu Felipe Massa mi gaañu"" which translates to ""he helped Felipe Massa to win"".  The passage focuses on Schumacher supporting Massa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bi Felipe Massa defee aksidan:** While the text *mentions* Massa's accident, it's not what Schumacher *did*.
* **B: Bimu amee juróom ñaareelu ndamam bimu ci champonnat bi:**  The text states he *one time* helped Massa, not that he consistently tried to win championships.
* **D: Ci njeexitalu pàccu 2009 bi:** This is related to the consequences of the accident, but not directly what Schumacher *did* in 2006.



"
Kañ la Massa am ay gaañ-gaañu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci ab Grand Prix**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nitu Bresil gi amna gaañ- gaañ gu metti Ginaaw aksidaa bi mu def ci Grand Prix bu Hongrie bu 2009."" This translates to ""The Brazilian had a serious accident during the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.""

Therefore, Massa's accident happened *during* a Grand Prix.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Bimu amee ndam ci Championnat bu Formule 1 bi:** While Massa participated in the Formula 1 Championship, the text specifically mentions an accident, not just participation.
*   **C: Laata Schumacher di bayyi:** The text mentions Schumacher retiring, but doesn't link it to Massa's accident.
*   **D: Laata paccu 2009 bi:** While the accident happened in 2009, the question asks *where* Massa had the accident, not *when*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Limu jëfandikookatu Yahoo! Ak cëri Microsfot yi nu boole dinanu wujje ak limu kiliyeng yu AOL yi."" This directly translates to ""Yahoo! and certain Microsoft services now compete with AOL's features.""  This means AOL's competitors *are* Yahoo and Microsoft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Njort nañu ni limu wey-jëfandikoo AOL yi dina yokk"" - This translates to ""It is true that AOL's competitors are gone."" This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **B:** ""AOL dina doon benn kër gu indi ay yokkute ci marsé messagerie instantanée bi"" - This translates to ""AOL was once a house that had a strong presence in the instant messaging market."" While true historically, it doesn't answer the question of *who* competes with AOL now.
* **D:** ""AOL dootu ñu ko jëfandikoowaat ci Etats-Unis"" - This translates to ""AOL used to advertise to them in the United States."" This is irrelevant to the question of current competition.



"
Ban ci tëraliin yii ñooy mêna jeex aparé tëral bu bees bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Wasaare Internet Fépp ci Amerig**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""ko waral mooy tasu jëfandikoowam ci biir Amerig"" which translates to ""its goal is to expand its influence in the American market.""  The entire passage discusses AOL's position and competition *within* the American internet landscape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jëfandikoo ja wu IM** (Expanding its IM influence) - While IM is *part* of the discussion, it's not the overarching theme.
* **C: Li AOL amee sañ-sañu wasaare marsé wam ci nimu ko bëggee** (AOL has a strong position in the market due to its size) - The passage describes a *struggle* for position, not a guaranteed strong position.
* **D: Liggéeyandoo ak Yahoo ak Microsoft** (Relationship with Yahoo and Microsoft) -  This is a detail *within* the broader context of the American internet market, not the main topic.



"
Ñaata nit yuñu faat ci cong gi ñoo nekkul woon ay polisé?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The text states: ""Benn ndaamaar bu am ndel m tàkk ci daluwaay polis ci Gaziantep, Turki demb ci suba rey na ñaari takk der te gaañ lu ëpp yeneen ñaar fukki nit.""  This translates to: ""Nineteen people were detained in a police operation in Gaziantep, Turkey, during a morning raid, including members of suspected ISIS members.""

Therefore, 19 people were detained."
Kan moo boole kiñu jàpp ni mo waral cong gi?,"The correct answer is **A: Poliis**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Poliss waxoon na ñoo ngi njoort ndawu bu jox boppam Desh (ISIL) mo def congu ji.""  This translates to ""Police said they arrested people linked to the dangerous Desh (ISIL) group and cut off their connection.""  The question asks *who* arrested the people, and the text explicitly states it was the police.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Biro gornor bi:** While the governor's office is mentioned, they didn't directly make the arrest.
*   **C: Nettalikat yi:** (The citizens) - The text doesn't say citizens made the arrest.
*   **D: Ñi dëkk Gazantep:** (Those who live in Gaziantep) - The text doesn't say residents made the arrest.



"
"Ndax tolluwaay Florinde biñu xamee ci réew mi xamne ki am ndam moo jël lépp, lan lañu jox Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **B: Parti Républicain buñu nomminé** (The Republican Party nominated him).

Here's why:

The text states that winning Florida is important because of the number of delegates it holds for the Republican party, and that a win strengthens Romney's position *within* the Republican party as a leading candidate.  The question asks *why* Florida is important to Romney.  It's not about the percentage of votes (A & D) or the general population (C), but about his standing in the race for the Republican nomination.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 ci ñi fi teewal réew mi** (32 of the state's people) - This is Newt Gingrich's vote percentage, not why Florida is important to Romney.
*   **C: Teewalkati réew mi yépp** (The states' populations) - The text doesn't focus on overall population size.
*   **D: 46 ci téemer bo jël ci pal gi** (46 of the votes in the race) - This is Romney's vote percentage, but doesn't explain *why* winning Florida matters.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban pusantaasu woote la Gingrich amoon ci pal gu njëkk gi?","The correct answer is **B: 32 ci teemer bo jël**.

The text states: ""Njiitu Amerique ba woon ci House Newt Gingrich moo jël ñaareelu palaas bi ak 32%."" This directly translates to ""American politician Newt Gingrich won the palace race with 32%.""

Therefore, Gingrich received 32% of the vote in the primary."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mo weyul di jiite biñu joxe résultats yu tukkee ci caucus?","The correct answer is **D: Romney**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Romney kàddu yu ñagas, ndax ci turam lañu amalee campagne yu bon yu dawal ci etaa bu Iowa teg ko ci deru Gingrich."" This translates to: ""...Romney was ahead, because in the end, he had better campaigns in the state of Iowa after it turned against Gingrich."" 

This directly indicates Romney was ahead in the results and benefited from the situation in Iowa. The other options are described as having difficulties or setbacks in their campaigns.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mo tagg beneen candidat bi ñu joxee résultat yu tukkee ci caucus bi?","The correct answer is **A: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bachman, mi am ndam ci woote Ames Straw ci Ut, jël na dogal dakkal kàmpaañam."" This translates to ""Bachmann, who participated in the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa, announced the end of her campaign.""  This directly indicates she dropped out *because* of the poor results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gingrich:** The text says Gingrich *gained* on Santorum and was doing well after Iowa, not that he dropped out.
*   **C: Romney:** The text states Romney was ahead of others, not that he withdrew.
*   **D: Perry:** Perry also continued his campaign after the initial caucus, though his strategy shifted.



"
Fan mo nekkoon mennum barab bu ñu wonee emisioŋ bi laata 2015?,"The correct answer is **C: Rajo AstroNet**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ci bi atum 2015 di bëgga jeex, TogiNet teg na AstroNet rajo ne mu melni estasiyong bu bariwul solo noonu.""  This translates to ""In 2015, TogiNet joined AstroNet radio to become the only broadcast station of its kind.""  Therefore, AstroNet radio is where the emissions began after 2015.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Rajo TogiNet:** TogiNet existed *before* 2015, and then joined AstroNet.
*   **B: East Texas:** This is the *location* of the amateur radio operators, not the radio station itself.
*   **D: Rajo yi ci biir dëkk bi:** This is too vague and not mentioned in the text as a specific station.



"
Rajo bi dafay xamle emisioŋ niki lu am ban xeetu mujjantal?,"The correct answer is **A: Amateur**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...emisiyoŋ bi dafa daan wone ci njëlbeen ay komejee yu yor ay **baati amatër** yu nekk ci penku Texas.""  This translates to ""...the emission is often done with the help of many **amateur** comedians located in the state of Texas.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Geek:** While the passage mentions ""anamu geek jéggi dayo!"" (a geeky atmosphere), it doesn't describe *who* is performing the emissions.
* **C: Yu yagg yi:** (The old ones) - The passage doesn't indicate the age of the performers.
* **D: Li ci dëkk bi:** (Those in the shop) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Lan la David Headley taataan bamu mujjee tax ñu song kuréelu militaŋ yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Xibaar** (Informants/Spies).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Geestuk David Headley ak ndajalém xibaar jappaléna ci yombalal lii ak fukki sox kat yu bayyéko ci soldaru Pakistani yi ci Laskhar-e-Taiba.""  This translates to ""David Headley and his team of *informants* helped in reconnaissance and provided information to Pakistani soldiers in Laskhar-e-Taiba.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ay grenade:** The text doesn't mention grenades.
*   **C: Ay nit yu yore nganaay:** (People who carry weapons) While the soldiers have weapons, the text specifies Headley provided *information*, not carried weapons himself.
*   **D: Ay nganaay yu otomatik:** (Automatic weapons) Again, the text doesn't mention weapons specifically, but focuses on intelligence gathering.



"
Ban xeetu dem ak dikk la kuréelu militaŋ yi jëfandikoo ngir tukki ca Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ci ñaar fukki fan ak juróom benn ci weeru Nowembar 2008, n indaale ay ndel, ay fetal te laal jubluwaay yu bare boole ci **Gaaru** saxaar buy bari nit bu Chhatrapati Shivaji ak Otelu Taj Mahal bu Siiw bi.""  This translates to: ""On the night of the attack and the crimes committed in the week of November 2008, they invaded several places, including the famous hotels in the city of **Mumbai** Chhatrapati Shivaji and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Sea View.""

The question asks what the attackers used to come to Mumbai, and the passage identifies **Gaaru (Mumbai)** as the location they attacked.  Therefore, ""Gaal"" (Mumbai) is the correct answer.



"
Ban wax mooy niru bu baax ak njuréefi Open bu Brisbane bu Nadal ak Raonic wax ci xët bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic amna ndam ci kaw Nadal**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Raonic moo ko dóor bu yàggul dara ci à l'Open de Brisbane."" This translates to ""Raonic gave him a good fight at the Open of Brisbane,"" meaning Raonic challenged Nadal.  This implies Raonic *competed* with Nadal (had a chance to win).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic amoon na 88% ci ay poñ:** The text says Nadal won 88% of the points, not Raonic.
* **C: Nadal amna ndaw ci kaw Raonic:** While Nadal won, the text doesn't specifically state he struggled against Raonic. It highlights Nadal's dominance with percentages.
* **D: Raonic dugal na 76 poñ:** The text states Nadal won 76 service points, not Raonic.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban toftalu joŋante bu Nadal ak Raonic buñu defee po mu njëkk mi?","The correct answer is **C: Score bi 7-2 la woon**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rekoor bi gëna mag ci Nadal ak doomu Kanadaa bii mooy 7-2."" This directly translates to ""The record of the match between Nadal and the Canadian player was 7-2.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raonic amoon na 88% ci ay poñ** - The passage says Nadal won 88% of the *points*, not Raonic.
* **B: Nadal amoon na 76 poñ** - The passage states Nadal won 76 *service points*, not total points.
* **D: Raonic ak Nadal** - This is just stating who played, not a specific detail *about* the match from the provided text.



"
Ban porogaraamu lakk moo bokkul woon ci ñetti emisioŋ yu Naked News?,"The correct answer is **D: Espagnol**.

Here's why:

The text (P) states: ""...mbootaay addina bi moo ngi tambale ay porogaraam ci làkki Español, Itaaliyee ak Koreyee..."" which translates to ""...these stations also broadcast programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean..."".

Therefore, Spanish is one of the languages the programs are broadcast in. The question asks for languages the programs *are* broadcast in, making Espagnol the correct choice.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan la emsioŋu Naked News bu bees bi dul am?","The correct answer is **B: Internet bi**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states that ""Naked News yegalon na né dina yokk bu baax mandat lak butim rewam ba ci yegal liy xew ak niet sournal... ci làkki Español, Itaaliyee ak Koreyee, ngir telewisiyoŋ, daluweb bi, ak telefon portaabal yi.""  This translates to: ""Naked News is available in many countries with significant demand for rewrites in new and existing languages... in Spanish, Italian, and Korean, for television, **the web**, and mobile phones.""

The question (Q) asks where the show is broadcast. While it's on TV and phones, the text *specifically* mentions ""the web"" (Internet) as one of the platforms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Telefon portaabal yi (Mobile phones):** It's *on* mobile phones, but not the primary platform described.
*   **C: Cinema yi (Cinemas):** The passage doesn’t mention cinemas.
*   **D: Télé (Television):**  It's on television, but the question asks for *where* it's broadcast broadly, and the Internet is highlighted as a key medium.



"
Ñaata joŋantekat ñoo jeexalul woon Giant Slalom bi?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""Ñeent ci mboolo jigéen ñuy def ski ci lajj nañu ngir jeexal seeni tuur, te **45 ci 117** skikat ci Giant Slalom bi lajj nañu ci raw gàddu gi.""  This directly translates to ""Forty-five out of 117 skiers competed in the Giant Slalom race in the final round.""

Therefore, 45 skiers participated in the Giant Slalom.



"
Ban ci yile wax ñoo dëppoo bu naax ak njuréefi rawante yi amoon ci Championnat yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci ñaareelu rawante gi, Carpenado moo jiitu woon ab defkat ski bu dëkk Hongry.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Li weesu xew-xewu Alarba, Carpanedo bokk na ci ñaari rawanté kenn pàr kenn ci Sampiyonaa yi."" (On Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in several competitions at the Championships.) and later mentions ""Giant Slalom bi, gis nan ko mu mujj ci fukkeelu palaas bi ci jigéen ñi ak waxtu daw bu nu dajale bu toll ci 4:41.30"" (In the Giant Slalom, he finished in a good position among the youngsters with a time of 4:41.30) and also references Claudia Loesch (Austrian) and Gyöngyi Dani (Hungarian).  This clearly indicates Carpenedo was competing *with* skiers from Hungary (and Austria).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 45 defkati ski jeexalu ñu woon seeni rawante ci Giant Slalom:** While the passage says ""45 ci 117 skikat ci Giant Slalom bi lajj nañu ci raw gàddu gi,"" this is simply stating the number of skiers who participated, not that they all finished well.
* **C: Defkati ski yu jeexal Giant Slalom lu ëpp lu Slalom def:** The passage doesn’t compare the number of skiers excelling in Giant Slalom *versus* Slalom.  It simply talks about results in both.
* **D: Carpenado fukkeelu palaas bi la jël ci Slalom bi:** The passage states he finished well in Giant Slalom, *not* Slalom.



"
Ban ci yile la NBA dogal ni dina ko dakkal?,"The correct answer is **C: Képp ku bokk ci ekip te ñu testé ko posotif ci COVID-19** (People who are on the team and tested positive for COVID-19).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ndogalu NBA mi ngi am Ginaawa nu ceytoo benn jongantekat bu Utah Jazz mu am Korona-19 wirus.""  This translates to ""NBA officials said a player from the Utah Jazz has the Coronavirus.""
* **Question (Q) asks:**  ""Ban ci yile la NBA dogal ni dina ko dakkal?"" which means ""What caused the NBA to pause?"".
* The cause of the pause was the discovery of a player testing positive, making option C the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pàccu Basket bi (The basket ball):** This is an object, not a reason for a pause.
* **B: Kenn kuy bokk ci ekipu Utah Jazz (Anyone who is on the Utah Jazz team):** Too broad. It's specifically the *positive test* that caused the pause.
* **D: Ekipu Basket bu Utah Jazz (The Utah Jazz basketball team):**  The team itself isn't the cause, but a member of the team testing positive is.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo waraloon ay jaaxle ci doomu jangoro bi?","The correct answer is **D: Ab joueur bu ekipu Utah Jazz lañu tésté positif.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...benn jongantekat bu Utah Jazz mu am Korona-19 wirus"" - which translates to ""...a player from the Utah Jazz has the Coronavirus.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A:** Too broad. The passage focuses specifically on the Utah Jazz.
* **B:** While true, it's not the *most* direct answer to the question ""what happened?"". It only specifies the players who tested positive, but doesn't mention *that* players tested positive.
* **C:**  The passage doesn't emphasize that it's a serious issue; it simply states a fact.



"
Kan moo dugal bit bi tax Washington Capitals am ndam ci seen joŋante ak waa Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndimbal Ovechkin bu njëkk ci guddi amoon na ci powu Duggal jël ndam bu rookie Nicklas Backstrom..."" which translates to ""Ovechkin finished first in the goal-scoring race, with a great game alongside rookie Nicklas Backstrom...""  The passage focuses on Ovechkin's performance *during* the game against Atlanta.

The question asks who scored goals for Washington during the game against Atlanta. The text explicitly states Ovechkin scored 2 goals and had 2 assists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nicklas Backstrom:** The text says Backstrom is a rookie *playing with* Ovechkin, not that he scored goals in this particular game.
*   **B: Jaromir Jagr & C: Mario Lemieux:** These players are mentioned in the context of a historical comparison (players who also scored 60+ goals in a season) but did *not* play in this game.



"
Kan mo dugal 60eelu bit ci saison bi ci joŋante bi amoon digante Capitals ak. Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ñaareeluu bii bumu dugal ci guddi gi mooy 60eel bi ci sézon bi, bimu nekkee futbalkat bi njëkka dugal 60 bii wala yeneeni bii ci benn sézon bimu tambalee ci 1995-96, bi Jaromir Jagr ak Mario Lemieux ku ci nekk àgg na fimu daan séntu.""  This translates to: ""...he became the first player to score 60 goals in a season, since Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux did so in 1995-96.""  

The previous sentence directly states Ovechkin achieved this feat: ""Ndimbal Ovechkin bu njëkk ci guddi amoon na ci powu Duggal jël ndam bu rookie Nicklas Backstrom.""  (Ovechkin was the first to score a goal in the game with rookie Nicklas Backstrom).

Therefore, Ovechkin is the player who scored 60 goals in the season mentioned in the context of the Capitals vs. Thrashers game.



"
Kañ la banku Northern Rock soxla wee ndimbal ci nguur gi?,"The correct answer is **A: Biñu nationnalisé bank bi** (It was nationalized).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ci atum 2010, donte dañ ko nasiyonaalisé, bank bu bees bu Northern Rock pic dañ ko xaajale woon ak ‘Bank bu bon bi’, Northern Rock (Caytug Moomeel)."" This directly translates to ""In 2010, it was nationalized, the bad bank of Northern Rock pic was renamed ‘Good Bank’, Northern Rock (Caytug Moomeel).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bi bank bi xajaloo wee ak banqaas bu yoré saytu gi** (It was sold to banks with better status) - While Virgin *did* take over the ""good bank"" portion, the overall bank was nationalized first.
* **C: Bi kuréelu Virgin jëndee bank bi** (It was bought by Virgin) - Virgin only took over the ""good bank"" part *after* nationalization.
* **D: Ci jamanoy crise crédit immobilier bi** (During the real estate credit crisis) - This explains *why* Northern Rock got into trouble, not what happened to it as a result.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax mooy wone bu baax lëkkaloo yi Kuréefu Virgin al ak bank bu Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: Virgin Group jënd na itam këru sayru moomeelu Northern Rock**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Mboolo Sir Richard Branson's Virgin amonna njëgu jëndkat ngir bank woccuna bu njëkk bank biir réew mi."" This translates to ""Sir Richard Branson's Virgin offered a rescue package for the bank, the first bank in the country.""  This clearly indicates Virgin was attempting to *save* Northern Rock.
* **The text further clarifies:** ""Virgin dafa jënd rekk “good bank” bu Northern Rock, jëndul bànkaas gu yor ameef yi."" This means Virgin only took over the ""good bank"" part of Northern Rock, and continued running it as a viable financial institution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Virgin Group moo ngi jënd bank biñ ko nationalisé ba noppi:** The text says Northern Rock *was* nationalized, not that Virgin nationalized it.
* **C: Virgin Group jox bank bi ndimbal lu jamp ci jamono crise crédit immobilier bi:** While Northern Rock's problems were related to the subprime crisis, this option doesn't accurately reflect Virgin's role as a potential rescuer.
* **D: Offre Virgin Group bu njëkk bi ñoo ngi ko amaloon biñu nationalisé bank bi ba noppi:** The offer came *before* the nationalization, not after.



"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, ban réew la xaatimu deggoo jawwu bu Kyoto laal?","The correct answer is **C: Australie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nguuru Australi gu conservative gu njëkk gi baañ na xaatim Kyoto..."" which translates to ""The first conservative Australian government refused to ratify Kyoto...""  This clearly indicates Australia initially did *not* ratify the Kyoto agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etats-Unis:** The text says the US initially signed but later didn't ratify.
*   **B: Inde:** The text mentions India and China as having large emissions but doesn't say they didn't ratify.
*   **D: Chine:** Same as India, the text focuses on their emissions, not ratification status.



"
Nguuru Australie bu njëkk ci lan la xalatoon ni xaatim Kyoto dina indi ay lorange?,"The correct answer is **D: Jubluwaayi emisioŋ yu réew mi**.

Here's why:

The text states the conservative Australian government initially refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, *fearing it would harm the Australian economy*. They were concerned about the impact on their emissions-intensive industries. This directly links their reluctance to the amount of emissions their country produces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etats-Unis:** While the US also didn't ratify Kyoto, the question is specifically about Australia's reasons.
*   **B: Koom-koomu réew mi:** This is too broad. The text focuses on a specific economic concern, not the overall well-being of the country.
*   **C: Njaayu charbon bitim-réew:** This is related, as coal is a significant source of emissions, but the concern is about *all* emissions, not just coal.



"
Ngir ban porogaraam lañu jëloon tireurs de piste yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Porogaraamu Sporting Shooters Association bu Australie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Buñu sukkeendiko ci Mick O’Flynn, Acting Directorr bi Park Conservation ak Heritage ak NPWS, gnénti natal kat yi gnu tan ngirr natal yu njeekk yi jotna gnu kaarangé ak taggat."" This translates to: ""They corresponded with Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage and NPWS, requesting information about training for new trackers and taggers.""  The text then implies they were directed to the **Sporting Shooters Association of Australia** for training.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Porogaraamu Park Conservation and Heritage:** While mentioned in the text, this is the *source* of the request for training, not the provider of it.
* **C: Porogaraamu NPWS:**  Similar to B, NPWS is involved but doesn't offer the training directly.
* **D: Porogaraamu rëbb bu Sporting Shooters Association:** The text doesn't mention a specific program *within* the SSA, just the association itself.



"
Ban ci wax yii moo mengoowul bi baax ak testu xeex saan yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Rangers yi ñoo doon saytu tireurs yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ranger yi dañu ko wara saytu bu baax, ndax dañu xayma saytu gi ak baaxaayam."" This translates to ""Rangers helped a lot with site access, because they knew the site and its surroundings.""  This clearly indicates rangers *facilitated* access for someone else.
* **The context:** The passage is discussing efforts to control parasites and mentions needing to ""taggat"" (tag) animals.  It makes sense that rangers would help ""tireurs"" (shooters/hunters) access the sites to do the tagging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Limu nekkee porogaraam bu njëkk bi, jotu ñu ko woon nàtt:** This translates to ""They started the first program, they made it happen."" While a program might have been started, the passage doesn't focus on *who* started it, but on access to sites.
* **B: Tireurs yi am nañu ab tektalu taggat:** This translates to ""The shooters couldn't tag."" The passage implies they *were* tagging.
* **D: Ñeenti tireurs lañu tannoon:** This translates to ""They hired the shooters."" The passage doesn’t mention hiring.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan la xaajaloo gi nekkee?","The correct answer is **D: Ci Ethiopie**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...loolu la Rift Valley Research Service wax ci **Éthiopie** ak benn way-bindandoo jàng mi, Berhane Asfaw."" (This was done by the Rift Valley Research Service **in Ethiopia** and another important person, Berhane Asfaw.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ci Rift Valley:** While the research service is *named* after the Rift Valley, the passage specifically states the work was done *in* Ethiopia.
*   **B: Ci ab fossile:** The passage doesn't directly mention fossils.
*   **C: Ci firndey moléculaire yi:** The passage mentions molecular findings, but the location of the work isn't stated as being *in* those findings.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo xeetu ci lu gêna teel niñ ko yaakaare woon?","The correct answer is **C: Cambarug firndey moleculaire bi** (The discovery of molecular fingerprints).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...dafay tekk ni tass gi am naa lu jiitu firnde molekuleer di ko waajal."" ( ...it is said that it has the fingerprints of the ancestors in it.) This directly refers to molecular fingerprints.
* The passage is discussing research that *found* these fingerprints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fossile buñu gis** (Old fossils) - While fossils are related to understanding the past, the passage specifically highlights the *molecular* discovery, not the fossils themselves.
* **B: Xaajaloo bo** (Old tools) - The passage doesn't mention tools.
* **D: Gêstu bi am ca Vallée du Rift** (The event in the Rift Valley) -  While the research *took place* in the Rift Valley, the question asks what was *discovered*, not where it happened.



"
Lan la ab joueur wara def ngir amal yëngu-yëngu yuy am ci ab powu wideo?,"The correct answer is **A: Fexel ba capteur yu controleur bi nekk ci wetu jumtukaay bi** (The flexibility of the controller's sensors in the player's hands).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...di nirook ab telekomànd, komand bi dafay jëfandikoo ay kaptër yuñu tek ci wetu tele aji-jëfandikukat bi ci defal ko ñatti koñ ci barab bu am ñetti digante."" This translates to ""...the innovation of the telecomand, the controller which allows movement of the hand in all directions, allowing it to be pointed and controlled in a vast space.""  This describes the use of sensors in the controller to detect player movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Def seen taxawaay ci ñetti koñ (Def seen taxawaay ci ñetti koñ):** While the passage mentions pointing, it's not the *main* innovation described as impacting gameplay and research.
* **C: tegal capteur yi ci wetu seeni tele (tegal capteur yi ci wetu seeni tele):** This doesn't relate to the passage's focus on *player* interaction and movement.
* **D: Toxal contrôleur bi ci biir ngelaw li (Toxal contrôleur bi ci biir ngelaw li):** This is too general and doesn't capture the specific innovation of sensor-based movement.



"
Lan lañu defar ngir mu nirook ab telecommande?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñaari capteur yu contrôleur bi** (The sensors of the controller).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the controller has sensors that allow for pointing at the screen and mimicking movements with the remote, distinguishing it from other controllers.  This is the *reason* for its unique ability to be used remotely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manette Nintendo Revolution:** This is just *what* the controller is called, not *why* it's special.
* **C: Wonandi bi gëna mag:** (Magnetic movement) The text doesn't mention magnetic movement.
* **D: Jumtukaayu Nintendo Revolution:** (Nintendo Revolution jump) This refers to the console itself, not the reason for the remote's function.



"
Lan lañu waxul ci nettali bu njëkk bi ci këru yeneekaay bii di Xinhua.,"The correct answer is **A: Roplaan bi jot na ab dankaafu bomb**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeneeni nettali wax nañu roplaan bi jot na ab àartu bomb te dañ ko deturné mu dem ca Afganistan...""  This translates to ""This morning, reports say a plane intending to carry bombs was diverted to Afghanistan...""
* **Option A directly reflects this information.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roplaan bi wàcc na ci Ürümqi** - While the passage mentions the destination after being diverted was near Ürümqi, it doesn't say the *plane went to* Ürümqi initially.
* **C: Dañoo détourner roplaan bi mu dem Afghanistan** - The passage states the plane *was* diverted, not that someone *tried* to divert it.
* **D: Roplaan bi wàcc na ci Kandahar** - Kandahar is mentioned as the location *in* Afghanistan where the plane went, but not as the original destination.



"
Lan lañu waxul woon ci nettali bu njëkk bu këru yeneekaay bii di Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **C: Dañoo détourné roplaan bi mu jubali Afganistan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeneeni nettali wax nañu roplaan bi jot na ab àartu bomb te dañ ko deturné mu dem ca Afganistan, mu wàcc ci Kandahar."" (This news reports that the plane was hijacked and went to Afghanistan, landing in Kandahar.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañoo détourné roplaan bi** (The plane was hijacked) - This is true, but doesn't answer *where* it was diverted *to*.
* **B: Dañoo terewoon roplaan bi mu wàcc ci lu jamp** (The plane took off and went to the airport) - This is incorrect; the passage states it was *hijacked* and went to Afghanistan.
* **D: Roplaan bi jotoon na ay fitna bomb** (The plane had a bomb) - While the passage mentions a bomb threat (""jot na ab àartu bomb""), it doesn't confirm the bomb's existence, and the main point is the hijacking and diversion.



Therefore, option C accurately summarizes the key information about the plane from the passage: it was hijacked and went to Afghanistan."
Lan la Sara Danius yëgle ci emisioŋu rajo bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ki gañe Prix Nobel bi ci Littérature** (Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Altine, Sara Danius, sekreteer permanaa bu Comité Nobel bu literature ci Academi bu Suede, dafa xamle ci benn emisioŋu rajo ci Sveriges Radio ca Suède ni ginaaw kuréel gi mënul jokkoo ak Bob Dylan ci ki gàddu neexalu Nobel ci literature 2016..."" (Altine, Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, was interviewed on a radio program on Swedish Radio about the reasons for awarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature to Bob Dylan, and the reactions they received).

* Danius was discussing *who* won the prize, and the controversy surrounding that decision. The other options are related to *how* the decision was made or the *reactions* to it, but the primary topic of the interview, and thus what Danius was talking about, was the winner.



"
Kan lañu mënul woon jot?,"The correct answer is **A: Wey-liggéeyando bu jege Bob Dylan**.

Here's why:

The passage states Altine, Sara Danius was discussing the *reason* for the Nobel Prize being awarded to Bob Dylan, and the reaction to that decision. The question asks *who* the discussion was *about*.  Therefore, the focus is on Bob Dylan and the controversy surrounding his award.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sara Danius:** While she *is* in the passage, she is the one *talking about* the issue, not the subject of the discussion.
*   **C: Akademu bu Suwed:** The Academy is the awarding body, but the passage focuses on the reaction to the specific awardee.
*   **D: Bob Dylan:** While the award is *to* Bob Dylan, the question asks *who the discussion was about*, which implies the source of the controversy or the reason for the questioning.



"
Kan moo wax ni doggu bi ab “jéego bu mage” la woon?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ki yor kàddu Bush di Gordon Johndroe, waxna ci matuwaay yi Corée du Nord jël, jàppee na ko """"jéego bu mag ci wàllu wàññi defarug ngànnaayu nucleaire ci anam wuñ mëna saytu"""".""  This translates to: ""Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, speaking about the issue of North Korea, called them """"a madman who doesn't care about giving up nuclear weapons in any meaningful way.""""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who used the phrase ""jéego bu mag"" (madman).



"
Ñaata timbre la Słania defar ngir ay réew yu bari?,"The correct answer is **B: 1000**.

The text states: ""Defar nalu ëpp 1000 tembar ngir Suwed ak yeneen 28 réew."" which translates to ""He produced 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Therefore, Słania produced 1000 stamps for other countries."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo wara waral sennug barigo yi?","The correct answer is **A: Ñaareelu barabu confinement bi dafa feesoon dell** (Leaks in the pipeline were detected).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...beneen mbànd bu nekk ci suufu mbànd yi te mëna jël ba ci 104 500 barigo kenn duyagu ko ba mu fees.""  This translates to ""...a leak occurred in the pipeline and approximately 104,500 barrels were lost due to it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ab testu routine bu systemu komandu tir bi** (Routine testing of the control system) - The text doesn't mention routine testing as the cause.
* **C: taweeku termik** (Thermal stress) - While thermal stress *could* cause a leak, the text specifically states a leak *occurred*.
* **D: Ab lakk ci benn estasioŋu pompage bu Greely** (A leak at a pumping station in Greely) - The text doesn't pinpoint the leak's location to a pumping station specifically. It just mentions Fort Greely in relation to the pipeline's overall route.



"
Lu tax soupape de décharge yi ubbeeku?,"The correct answer is **A: Dafa amoon ab taaweeku termik ci biir barigo yi** (They are used to relieve thermal stress in the pipeline).

Here's why:

The passage states the valves release pressure and ""lessen the stress"" in the pipeline, specifically relating to the expansion and contraction caused by temperature changes (""taaweeku termik"").  This is the function of relief valves in a long pipeline like the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dafa amoon ab jafe-jafe ci sistemu test bi** (They are used for safety in the testing system) - The passage doesn't mention testing.
* **C: Barigo yi dañoo feesoon dell** (The barrels are leaking) - The passage states the valves *prevent* issues, not that there are leaks.
* **D: Barabu confinement bi mënul woon jël baril yu doy** (The confinement barriers hold a large number of barrels) - This describes the reservoir capacity, not the valves' function.

"Fimne nii, fan la kawewaayu ndox mi toll ci Ninth Ward ?","The correct answer is **D: 100 tank**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndox mi dafay romb dig bi ci pàcc 100 meetar ci yaatuwaay."" This translates to ""These houses are densely built with a space of 100 meters between them.""  ""Tank"" in this context refers to houses/buildings. Therefore, the passage indicates there are houses every 100 meters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 20 tank** - Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: 6 baraam** - ""Baraam"" doesn't fit the context of houses being described.
*   **C: Taay bu kawe** - ""Taay bu kawe"" means ""many"" which is vague and doesn't give a specific number like the passage does.



"
Ci jamonoy ngelawu Katrina lan mo xewoon ci Ninth Ward?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndox yu am doole yi demoon nañu ba 20 tank ci kawewaay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...moo am tay ay inondation 20 pied ginaaw bi fa ouragan Katrina jaaree..."" (There were floods of 20 feet after Hurricane Katrina...) and ""...Ndox mi dafay romb dig bi ci pàcc 100 meetar ci yaatuwaay."" (The houses were scattered over 100 meters in the water.)

* **Option C** directly reflects this information - ""Ndox yu am doole yi demoon nañu ba 20 tank ci kawewaay"" translates to ""Houses that were destroyed were seen up to 20 feet in the water.""  This aligns with the 20-foot flooding mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Yaatuwaayu ndox yi ñu ngi tolloon ci 100 tank"" - The passage mentions houses *scattered* 100 meters, not the water level being 100 feet.
* **B:** ""Ndox mu yem ba ci ndig li weesu na digue bi"" - The passage doesn't specifically mention the digue (levee) or whether houses were near it.
* **D:** ""6 baraami taw bënn nañu digue bu yaqu bi"" - The passage doesn’t mention the number of people or a specific digue.



"
Ban ci yile la Hamilton firndéelul woon?,"The correct answer is **A: Fi malaat bi demoon tukki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Malaat yi nekoon na Niseriya, fi nga xamantane yenn kaawu wirisu Ebola amoon nañ fa."" (The patients were from Nigeria, and one was suspected of having the Ebola virus.)
* **""tukki""** means ""sick"" or ""ill"" in Wolof.
* The question asks *why* Hamilton was sent to the hospital. The passage clearly indicates it was because of the potential illness (Ebola suspicion).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Li beneen malaat mënee am doomu jangoro bi** - The passage doesn't mention anything about a long-term illness.
* **C: Ndax topp nañu protocal bi ci baax** - While the hospital *did* have protocols for infection control, this isn't the *reason* Hamilton was sent there initially.
* **D: Fi wergu-yaramu malaat bi toll** - The passage doesn't mention a severe illness or the patient being in critical condition upon arrival.



"
Lan la nit yu xarañ yi bëgg a xam?,"The correct answer is **C: Lan mooy matière organique**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Comets yi xeeyna mu nékoon fun dox di bayéko ci suuf ci ay mbir yu meenee indi ay proteins té deegeereel dundu.""  This translates to ""Comets contain dust and are made up of ice and also contain proteins which are fundamental building blocks.""  The passage implies comets hold the *ingredients* for life, which are organic materials.
* **""Matière organique""** means organic matter in French, which aligns with the presence of proteins and the potential for life-building components.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bi Cometes yi mbëkantee ak Suuf si:**  While true, the passage *explains* comets are made of ice, it doesn't answer what scientists are trying to find out.
* **B: Nan la proteines yi di formé wo:** The passage mentions proteins *existing* in comets, not how they are formed.
* **D: Nan lañu tëggee Suuf si:**  The passage doesn't say scientists are looking for ice specifically, but rather what comets are *made of* which could lead to life.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban liggéey la poliisu dëkk bi def ci tëj bi?","The correct answer is **A: Ñaan nañ FBI mu tëj**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""FBI deggal na kilifay Maryland Transportaion ñu tëj lépp."" (The FBI investigated the Maryland Transportation incident.)
* **The question asks:** What happened regarding the police intervention in the incident?
* **Option A** directly answers this by stating the FBI investigated (tëj) – meaning they were involved in looking into the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jël nañu dogalu têj ko** (They said they delayed the investigation) - The passage doesn't mention any delays.
* **C: dañoo jubël dawalkati woto yi ci beneen jubuwaay** (They didn't appreciate the actions of the officers in the area) - The passage doesn't discuss opinions on police actions.
* **D: Dañoo xamle ay yeex-yeex ci dem ak dikk bi ci beneen yoon bi** (They didn't know anything about the movement and traffic in the area) - The passage implies they *did* investigate the movement and traffic.



"
Lan mo xew ci dugukaayi tube yi biñuy tëj?,"The correct answer is **B: Dañ leen jëfandikoo woon niki ab wiirikaay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kamiyongu mbalit lañu jëfandikko ngir tëj yoon bi te ndimbal 80 poliss teewoona ngir wax boroom moto ñu wiiri."" This directly translates to ""Many companies are financing to build a road with about 80 police officers to stop motorcycle riders.""  This means they are *funding* or *financing* the project to address the motorcycle issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañ leen boloké woon:** (They are building them) - While construction is happening, the passage focuses on the *financing* of the road, not the physical building itself.
* **C: Dañ leen ubbiloon dawalkati moto yi:** (They are arresting motorcycle riders) - The police are there to *prevent* riders, not necessarily arrest them (though that could happen). The passage says they are there to ""stop"" riders.
* **D: Dafa amoom dem ak dikk bu xat:** (They came with a dangerous plan) - There's no indication of danger or a negative plan in the passage. It's a security measure.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo xewul woon balaa ndamaar bi di mbëkk fotogaraaf bi?","The correct answer is **A: Fotogaraaf bi jot na ndigalu Highway Patrol ngir jeggiwaat tali bi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...loolu moo waral polisié bu Californie bi taxawal auto yi ñaari yoon ngir may ko mu jeggi dem dellusi."" and ""...wóorul dara ni kiy dawal ndaamar bi te bëkk fotogaraaf bi nangu liñ koy tuumal."" This translates to: ""...this led to the California police stopping cars to find him and prevent him from leaving"" and ""...it was clear he was given a ticket and the photographer was also warned not to do it again.""

This clearly indicates the photographer was dealt with *by* the Highway Patrol (police) after the incident involving Justin Bieber and the pursuit.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the incident happened on Sepulveda Boulevard, the passage doesn't say the photographer *received* a ticket there, only that the incident *occurred* there.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention the photographer receiving a traffic stop *before* the incident, only consequences *after*.
* **D:** The photographer was warned not to repeat the action, not simply allowed to continue taking photos.



"
Lan la ab fotogaraaf nekkoon di jéema def laata ndamaar bi di ko mbëkk?,"The correct answer is **B: Jël ay foto ci stop bu poliis bi** (Taking photos at a police stop).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...loolu moo waral polisié bu Californie bi taxawal auto yi ñaari yoon ngir may ko mu jeggi dem dellusi... loolu moo waral polisié bu Californie bi taxawal auto yi ñaari yoon ngir may ko mu jeggi dem dellusi."" This directly translates to ""...this led to the California police stopping cars to see if they were speeding... this led to the California police stopping cars to see if they were speeding.""  The photographer was taking photos *at* these police stops, which is what got them in trouble.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gaaré ci Sepulveda Boulevard** (A place on Sepulveda Boulevard) - While the incident *happened* on Sepulveda Boulevard, it's not what the photographer was doing that caused the issue.
* **C: Jeggi ab otorup bu xat** (Speeding in a car) - The photographer wasn't speeding, the *drivers* being stopped *by police* were potentially speeding.
* **D: Def lumu mën ngir polise bi bayyi ko mu wey di jël foto** (A small favor for the police to let him take photos) - The text implies the photographer was causing a problem, not doing a favor.



"
Ban wax mo dul xamle ci anam gu leer fi wergu-yaramu njiitu réew mi toll biñ ko testé positif ci doomu jangoro bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Yaramam neexul**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dañoo gisoon ni Arias dafa amé doomu-jangoro budul feeñ..."" (News reports that Arias tested positive for the coronavirus...) and ""...ministëru bjiitu réew mi Rodrigo Arias wax."" (Minister Rodrigo Arias announced...)
* **The question asks:** Who was tested positive for the coronavirus?
* **""Yaramam neexul""** translates to ""Someone tested positive,"" and the passage clearly identifies that person as Rodrigo Arias.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baatam dafay metti:** (People are tired) - This is not related to the coronavirus test result.
* **C: Dafa nekk ci anam bu yemamaay:** (Is in a good health state) - The passage indicates he *tested positive* for a virus, so he is *not* necessarily in good health.
* **D: Yaramam dafa tang:** (Someone is sick) - While testing positive implies sickness, the question specifically asks *who* tested positive, and the passage provides that answer.



"
"Suu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, ban ci yile wax ci laju ci njiitu réew mi mooy dëgg?","The correct answer is **A: Yaramam tangul**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soo ci gennee tangooru yaram ak put buy metti..."" This directly translates to ""It is good to have a good relationship with the press and journalists...""  This means a good relationship with the press is *important*. ""Yaramam tangul"" means ""good relationship.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dina des ci këram ay ayu-bis:** (Things are discussed in the media in many ways) - While the passage mentions the media, it doesn't focus on *how* things are discussed, but rather the *importance of a good relationship* with it.
* **C: Wer na bu baax ngir liggéey ci këram:** (It is good to speak in the media) - The passage doesn't focus on *speaking* in the media, but maintaining a *relationship* with it.
* **D: Dafa am doomu jangoro bu garaaw:** (He has a poor relationship with journalists) - The passage implies the opposite - the need for a *good* relationship.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ lai Cyclone Tropical Gonu nara wey di wàññeeku?","The correct answer is **A: Laata muy àgg Maldives**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** states that Tropical Cyclone Gonu *hit the Maldives*. The question asks where Cyclone Gonu impacted.
* The other options are details *about* the cyclone (wind speed, distance) but don't answer the *where* question.

Therefore, option A directly answers the question based on the information in the passage.



"
Lan mo nekkoon gaawaayu ngelaw yi ci li gëna foor bu Tropical Cyclone Gonu?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 miles waxtu wu nekk**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the wind speed of Tropical Cyclone Gonu.**
* **The text states:** ""yéggna ci ngélaw wu 240 kilometers ci bénn waxtu ( 149 miles ci bénn waxtu).""  This means the wind speed was 240 kilometers *or* 149 miles per hour.
* **Option C** directly states ""149 miles waxtu wu nekk"" (149 miles per hour was).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 149 kilomeetar waxtu wu nekk** - While 149 kilometers is *a* speed mentioned, the question doesn't ask for kilometers.
* **B: 240 miles waxtu wu nekk** - The text gives both 240km *and* 149 miles, and the question doesn't specify kilometers.
* **D: 83 kilomeetar waxtu wu nekk** - 83 km/h is mentioned as the *minimum* sustained wind speed, not the peak.



"
Ban ci yile mbir lañu jàppee niki ab rëddu raññeekaayu Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: Ab xeetu garab buy sax si géej la**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes Karenia brevis as causing harm to fish and other marine life.** It mentions fish dying and a general disruption of the ecosystem.  The passage highlights the negative impact (""bénn amaline-ci ci géj aalam késé ab mbir"" - a bad thing for the sea and its creatures).
* **Option A (""Ab xeetu garab buy sax si géej la"" - It causes damage to many things in the sea) directly reflects this harm.**  It's the most accurate summary of the passage's description of *Karenia brevis*'s effect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mën na dakkal siditi doomu adama (It doesn't affect human health):** The passage *does* mention that it affects humans and animals (""ci nit ñi ak jën yi""), so this is incorrect.
* **C: Dafa bari ay cellules (It creates cells):**  The passage describes *Karenia brevis* as harmful, not as something that creates cells.
* **D: Dafay ab natirelma (It's a natural phenomenon):** While algal blooms can be natural, the passage focuses on the *negative consequences* and harm caused by *Karenia brevis*.  The focus isn't on its natural occurrence, but on its damaging effects.



"
Ban ci mbir yii la Karena brevis mënul def?,"The correct answer is **A: Dakkar siditu jën**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Waamé bu xonk Karenia brevis bu geenee kawé té far mokoy joxé, bénn amaline-ci ci géj aalam késé ab mbir. Ndogali sunu boroom yu baax mën na waral màggug algues yi gaaw...""  This translates to something like: ""The bloom of *Karenia brevis* has caused many fish to die, a disaster for the ecosystem and the sea. Many good people are worried about the abundance of harmful algae...""
* **The question asks:** What did the bloom of *Karenia brevis* cause?
* **""Dakkar siditu jën""** means ""death of fish"", which directly corresponds to the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yokk ci lu gaaw ci ay lim ci anam bumu mëna doon:** This refers to pollution in general, not specifically caused by *Karenia brevis*.
* **C: Laal ndox mi:**  This means ""harm to the sea"" - while the bloom *causes* harm, the direct result mentioned is fish death.
* **D: Defar ab neutroxine:** This talks about releasing nutrients, not the direct effect of the bloom.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci ët bi, ban ci yile mbir mo amul woon bi Ouranga Felicia ñëwee?","The correct answer is **B: Taw yu andak ay dënnu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on rainfall (taw)** and its intensity (""161,036 mm ci natt""). It describes the rainfall as ""baax"" (good/significant) and mentions it caused flooding (""ay dëndu daan faral di àndaale"").  The passage is *about* the rain and its effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wis-wisël yu am njariñ (Warnings that are issued):** While the passage *implies* warnings were issued because of the hurricane, it doesn't directly discuss the warnings themselves. It focuses on the *result* of the hurricane – the rainfall.
* **C: Foudre yuy ñëw lu bari (Lightning that fell heavily):**  The passage doesn't mention lightning at all.
* **D: Mbënd yu ci tali bi (Floods in the area):**  While flooding is *a result* of the rainfall, the passage's primary focus is on the *amount* of rain, not the flooding itself.



"
Ban wax ci Ouraga Felicia mo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **B: Dañ ko njëkk jàppee niki ab depression tropical laata muy nekk ab tampetu 4 wàll.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Felicia, benn yoon ab Wàllu 4 dënnu ci Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, wàññeeku na ba ci ab depersiyon toropikaal laata muy nëbb Talaata.""  This translates to ""Felicia, a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, developed from a tropical depression last Tuesday.""  This directly supports answer B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ttaw yi ci am jariñ nañu Oahu** - While the passage *mentions* rainfall on Oahu, it doesn't say that's what the passage is *about*. It's a detail, not the central point.
* **C: Li ëpp ci duun yi taw nañu** -  The passage doesn’t focus on what happened to the rain.
* **D: Ay taw yu andak ay eclairs** - This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Ban wax moo mengoo bu baax ak njuréef yu tuke ci Hungarian Grand Prix bu 2009?,"The correct answer is **B: Piquet Jr. moo jëloon ndam li** (Piquet Jr. finished in the lead).

Here's why:

The text states ""Dàq nañu Piquet Jr. Ginaaw joŋante biñ tuddee Grand Prix bu Hongrie 2009."" This translates to ""Then Piquet Jr. won the final round of the Hungarian Grand Prix 2009.""  Therefore, he finished in the lead.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fernando Alonso bokkoon na ci ab aksidaŋ** (Fernando Alonso was in an accident) - The text doesn't mention Alonso having an accident in the Hungarian Grand Prix. It only refers to an incident in Singapore 2008.
*   **C: Li ci topp, dañoo fitaloon Piquet Jr** (It was at the top, then Piquet Jr. finished) - The text directly states Piquet Jr. *won*, not just finished.
*   **D: Woto kaarànge bi bokkoon na ci ab aksidaŋ** (The other car was in an accident) - The text doesn't mention another car being in an accident.



"
Fan la aksidaŋ bi amee?,"The correct answer is **A: Bo weeso Arret bu standu Alonso ci saasi**.

Here's why:

The text states Piquet Jr. helped Alonso by intentionally crashing (""tojna"") to benefit Alonso's race strategy. The text specifically mentions Alonso was in the pit stop (standu) when Piquet Jr. crashed.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bi beneen woto bi nekkoon di jël essans:** The text doesn't mention anything about fuel.
* **C: Laata woto kaarànge bi di génn:**  The text doesn't say the car was damaged in a general way, but rather a deliberate crash.
* **D: Bi Piquet demee wutu esans:** The text doesn't say Piquet crashed *because* he ran out of fuel. It was a planned crash.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mo jëloon diir bu gëna ndaw bu gëstukat yaakaaroon ci njëlbéen?","The correct answer is **A: Bi espèce nekkoon di forméwu**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how new finch species are forming (evolving) due to differences in beak shape, related to their food sources (cactus vs. other seeds). This is a classic example of *speciation* – the formation of new and distinct species in the course of evolution. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Reportaas bu àju ci espèce yi:** The passage doesn’t talk about reports or observations, but about the *process* of change.
*   **C: Yar ci digante espèce yu wuute yi:** While there is competition between finch species, the core of the passage is not about conflict, but about the emergence of new ones.
*   **D: Maggaay espèce yi:** The passage focuses on *how* species develop, not simply on their number.



"
Ban ci yile la gëstukat yi nettaliwul?,"The correct answer is **A: Fan lañu formé espèce yu bees yi** (They formed new species).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gëskatu yu Université bu Princeton ci réewu États-Unis ak yu Université bu Uppsala ci Suède wax nañu ni amna ay xeet yu bees yu màgg ci diiru ñaari génération kese..."" (Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden found that there are new species of finches in recent generations...).  This directly supports the idea that they *formed* new species.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yagaayu maggaay bi:** (The magnitude of change) - While the passage implies change, it focuses on the *result* of the change (new species), not the amount of change itself.
* **C: Turu espèce yu bees yi:** (All species of finches) - The passage specifically talks about *new* species, not all finch species.
* **D: Picc yu bokk ci yar bi:** (Birds in the area) - This is too general. The passage is about a specific finding - the *formation of new species*.



"
Fan la CowParade di amee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci dëkku taaxu Bucharest** (In the taxi stands of Bucharest).

Here's why:

* **P** describes a new campaign by the Bucharest City Hall to decorate taxis with art inspired by Roman capital art. It mentions taxis in Bucharest being decorated.
* **Q** asks where the CowParade (a public art installation often involving decorated cows) is located.
* Given the context of **P**, the CowParade is likely integrated into this taxi decoration campaign *in Bucharest*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci ay dëkki Rumani yu bari** (In some big Romanian cities) - The passage specifically focuses on Bucharest.
* **C: Ci biir bëj-saalumu Orop jéemee ko penku** (In the Orop tourist areas near the park) - While mentioning parks, the core focus is taxis.
* **D: Ci ay dëkki taaxi Orop yu bari** (In some big Orop taxi stands) - The passage clearly states *Bucharest* taxis.



"
Ban ci yile wax ñooy xamle bu baax CowParade?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab xew-xew fent buñu amaloon ci jamonoy tangooru Orop bëj-saalum feete penku.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes new cows appearing in Bucharest as part of a City Hall campaign.** It mentions they are decorated and relate to the ""Kapital Romaani"" (Romanian Capital) and a company called WoneNag. It also references their placement in public spaces.
* **CowParade is a public art exhibition featuring decorated cow sculptures.** This aligns perfectly with the description in the passage.
* **Option C** directly states that the new cows are being *used* in a campaign, which matches the passage.  It also mentions their appearance in the city (""feete penku"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci gëkki taax yuñu jàppee ni “luy sos”** – This doesn't relate to the passage's content.
* **B: Bucharest City Hall moo ko sos** – While the City Hall is *involved*, it's not the meaning of the cows themselves.
* **D: Mooy xew-xewu fentu askan bu gëna mag ci adduna bi** - This is too broad. The passage specifically refers to the cows being part of a local campaign, not just generally beautiful cows around the world.



"
Lan moo waraloon Risi mu ajandi jëfandikoo II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Ab aksidaŋ** (Accidents).

Here's why:

The text states: ""II-76 bi dafa nekkoon aab pàcc bu mag bu takk deru Russe yi ak Sowiet yi ci 1970, te ab akisdaa bu meti am na ba pare c Russi weer wi nu weesu."" This translates to ""The II-76 was a large transport plane used by the Russians and Soviets in the 1970s, and it had a high accident rate, especially in the harsh Russian climate.""  The text directly links the II-76 to accidents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuréel yu ci biir dëkk bi:** (Items in a shop) - This is irrelevant to the text.
* **C: Soldaaru Sovietik:** (Soviet Soldiers) - While the plane *was used* by the Soviets, the question asks what *caused* problems with it.
* **D: Ab gëstu bu ajandi:** (A helping hand) - This is the opposite of what the text describes.



"
Lan mooy II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab roplaan** (It is an airplane).

Here's why:

The text states: ""II-76 bi dafa nekkoon aab pàcc bu mag bu takk deru Russe yi ak Sowiet yi ci 1970..."" which translates to ""The II-76 was a large transport plane used by the Russians and Soviets in the 1970s...""

Therefore, II-76 is clearly identified as a plane.



"
Kan moo jël kuréelu bind bi ngir Les Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Simpsons yi ak **Brooks ak Groening**, te nekkoon na njiit buy jël kureel gi njëkka bind film bi."" (The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and they created the animated series that became a successful film.)

This directly links Groening to the creation of the animated series (and therefore the film). While Brooks is mentioned alongside Groening, the text emphasizes Groening's role in *creating* it.



"
"Ci xalaatu Fluke, mi ko daan yónnee addu ak ay waaw-goor?","The correct answer is **B: Ay jëfkat yu jigéen yuy yëngu ci wergu-yaram**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Fluke bind na ni ñenn ñi jotu ñu mëna tere jigeen ñi wax ci seen wergu-yaram."" This translates to ""Fluke affects those who live in warm countries.""  It then continues to describe how doctors deal with the consequences.
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""In the case of Fluke, who do people consult with regarding health and well-being?""
* **Option B** directly relates to the passage, mentioning the health concerns (""jëfkat yu jigéen"" - health issues) and the geographical location (""ci wergu-yaram"" - in warm countries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dokoor yi (Doctors)** - While doctors *treat* the effects of Fluke, the passage focuses on *who people consult* when facing problems related to living in warm climates where Fluke is present. It's not a direct answer to the question.
* **C: Ay góor (People)** - Too broad.  The question is about health-related consultation.
* **D: Ay góor ak ay jigéen (People and health)** -  Similar to C, too broad and doesn't pinpoint the specific consultation aspect.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la yenn nit yi bëggul wax?","The correct answer is **C: Wergu-yaramu jigéen ñi**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** is talking about a problem affecting livestock (wergu-yaram) and people who care for them (jigéen ñi). It describes a disease that causes significant loss.
* **Q (the question)** asks who is most affected by the problem described in the text.
* The passage directly states the problem affects ""wergu-yaram ñi wax ci seen wergu-yaram...jigeen ñi wax.""  This translates to ""livestock and those who tend to them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ay nit yu góor (Ordinary people)** - While it *could* affect ordinary people, the passage focuses on livestock and their caretakers.
* **B: Njëgi paj (A small amount)** - The passage describes a serious issue causing loss, not a small amount.
* **D: Fluke** - ""Fluke"" is mentioned as the *cause* of the problem, not *who* is affected by it.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban palanet moo gëna yëngu?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ben yaram adduna mo am di wone lu ëp xarañte kë Titan..."" which translates to ""...people have always dreamed of traveling to Titan...""

Therefore, Titan is the planet mentioned in the text as a destination for travel/dreaming.
"
Ay dex ak ay déeg yu am ndox yu mu leer lañu gis ci ban palaanet?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically mentions ""ben yaram adduna mo am di wone lu ëp xarañte kë Titan"" which translates to ""some people believe they saw something strange on Titan."" This directly links Titan to being a planet where something unusual (potentially ""ndox"" - creatures) might be found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jupiter:** Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Naaj wi (We):**  Refers to people generally, not a specific planet.
*   **D: Saturne:** While Titan *is* a moon of Saturn, the passage focuses specifically on Titan itself as the location of potential sightings.

Ban ci yile mbir yu feeñ moo nekkul njuréefu li feeñ ci duŋq bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Meloy duŋqu mala bi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siyantifik yi wax nañu melo duŋku mala bii dafa sokolaa ci dënn bi ak suuf bu weex bu am melo karatenoyit."" This translates to: ""Scientists say that the soft tissues of the dinosaurs are being studied in the skin and a strange substance that contains a lot of karatenoid.""  This directly refers to soft tissues found *within* the dinosaur remains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ab nandite ci ni jëfandikoo wuñu duŋq yi ci wol yi** - This translates to ""And interest in finding dinosaurs in the world."" The passage doesn't focus on the *search* for dinosaurs, but what is *found* within them.
*   **C: Xoolandi ci maggaayu duŋq** - This translates to ""Research on dinosaur tracks"". The passage isn't about footprints.
*   **D: Firnde ni dinosaur yu bari am nañu ay duŋq** - This translates to ""Finding dinosaurs that already have bones"". The passage focuses on soft tissue, not just bones.



"
Lan la duŋqu dinosor amul?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay mustaas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...amul yeneen melokaanu duŋqu — Sikkim ak **mustaas** — gêstukat yi gis nañu ni rachis ab mbir muy yokk ci biir la buy yeneen melokaan yii.""  This directly identifies *mustaas* as one of the types of dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ab bantu duŋq:** The text doesn't say dinosaurs are ""ab bantu duŋq"" (many dinosaurs).
* **C: Ay duŋqi mag:** While the text mentions a large dinosaur, it doesn't identify *all* dinosaurs as ""ay duŋqi mag"" (a large dinosaur).
* **D: Ab xeetu melo ci suufam:** This translates to ""many kinds of animals in the family"" and isn't a specific identification of what dinosaurs *are*.



"
Ban ci yile wax ci wàllu ZMapp mo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **A: Ay antikoor lañ ko defaree**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Benn kokteelu antikoor, ZMapp, wonewn na yaakaar ci geew bi..."" (This cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, is made up of...)
* This directly indicates that ZMapp *is* comprised of antibodies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mën naa faj ay infections yu am waaye du àrtu ci faatu:** While the passage mentions it helps with Ebola, it doesn't say it *prevents* all infections, just that it helped people who *had* Ebola.
* **C: Jëfe woon nañ ko niki ab testu PALM:** The passage says PALM *used* ZMapp, not that it was tested *on* PALM.
* **D: Gëstu yi wone nañu ni ay njuréefam ñoo gëna tuuti luñu daan njëkka jëfandikoo:**  While scientists are still studying it, the passage doesn't highlight a problem with understanding its effects. It states scientists are *investigating* it further.



"
Ban ci yile wax ñooy xamle bu baax testu PALM bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ab garabu témoin lañu méngale oon ak yeneen ñetti paj , benn ci ñoom mo tuddoon ZMapp.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci saytug PALM, ZMapp la ñu ko doon càmbaree, loolu mooy wane ni scientifique yi dañu ko jëfandikoo ni royuwaay ba noppi ñu mengale ko ak yeneen ñaati pajtal.""  This translates to: ""In the PALM study, ZMapp was administered, this was done so that scientists could observe and compare it with other treatment groups.""  This directly supports the idea that some patients in the PALM study were given ZMapp as part of a comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't focus on *advantages* of the PALM test, only what was *done* in it.
* **C:** While the passage mentions scientists studying ZMapp, it doesn't say it was *specifically* designed to be studied. It was *used* in a study.
* **D:** The passage doesn't discuss whether the study was successful in reducing deaths; it focuses on *how* the study was conducted.



"
Fan la gëstukat yi xalaat ni puce bu bees bi mooy doon li ëpp solo?,"The correct answer is **A: Réew yu am koom yu néew** (Developing countries).

Here's why:

The passage states the lead researchers believe this technology can help diagnose cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and other diseases *in developing countries* (""ci malaat yi nekk ci réew yu neew doole yi"").  It also mentions its potential to detect cancer early, especially in countries with limited resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Réew yu ëpp alal** (Developed countries) - The passage focuses on the *need* in developing countries, not developed ones.
* **C: Ci Etats-Unis** (In the United States) - While Stanford is in the US, the focus of the technology's benefit is elsewhere.
* **D: Ca Iniwersité Stanford** (At Stanford University) - Stanford developed the technology, but the impact is intended to be global, especially in resource-limited settings.



"
Ban anam lañuy jëfandikoo ngir tabax jumtukaayu saytu bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Benn santimu amerig ku nekk**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pus bu ndaw bu nu imprme bu nu mëna defar jëfandikoo daa bu imprimant yi ngir lu toll ci **benn dërëmu amerig** bu nekk.""  This translates to ""...so that we can print and offer diagnostic kits with the printers for use in **American hospitals**.""

The question asks what the diagnostic kits are *for*. The passage directly links them to use in American hospitals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Móolukaayi jet d’ancre yu baaxo:** (Lower anchoring molecules) - Not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Ay puce yuñu mëna móol:** (Some cells that contain molds) - While the text discusses cells, it doesn’t connect them to the *purpose* of the kits.
* **D: Yeneen jumtukaayi saytu:** (Specific site diagnostics) - Too broad; the text specifies *where* they are being used (American hospitals).



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban wax escarpements lobés yi moo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **B: Seen teewaay mu ngi tekki weer wi ñakkul ay liggéeyi géoloque**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Wax jii dafay weddi dëggal gi nga xam ne dafay firnde ni weer wi amul benn yengu yengu ci wàllu séwolosi."" (The last sentence says the scientist found that the rock had been subject to intense geological activity.)
* **Option B** directly relates to this, stating that the formations (escarpements lobés) are a result of geological activity (""liggéeyi géoloque"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Xew-xew bi leen sos mel na ni lu am ci lu yaggul dara"" - This just says the formations are well known and of good quality, but doesn’t explain *why* they exist.
* **C:** ""Mën nnañu doon lu waral weer wi di waññeeku"" - This says they formed because the rock was eroded, which isn't the main point of the passage.  The erosion *happened* because of geological forces.
* **D:** ""Amul woon ñu bari ci ñoom ñu nekk ci ëttu weer wi"" - This states they are simply part of the rock, offering no explanation for their formation.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xalaat bu àju ci reliefs yi mooy wone ni amna ab liggéeyu géologue ci weer wi?","The correct answer is **A: Weer waa ngi waññeeku ndank-ndank** (The rock was deeply eroded).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gisoon nañu yile suuf ci weer wi te dañoo meloon ni lu melni lu xawa nekk ci jawwu, di wone xew-xewi geologue yi leen sosoon dañoo beesoon."" (They found traces of soil on the rock, and these geologists believe it proves deep erosion).  The ""escarpements lobés"" are a *result* of deep erosion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sos nañu relief yi lu yagg lool:** (They found very high reliefs) - The passage doesn't emphasize the height, but the *way* they were formed (by erosion).
* **C: Ab doyoo reliefs yu ndaw kese ñoo am ci ëttu weer wi:** (There are few reliefs present on the surface of the rock) - The passage suggests the reliefs *are* there, just formed by a specific process.
* **D: Ci lu yaggul dara lañu sos reliefs yi:** (They studied the reliefs in detail) - While geologists study them, the main point is *why* they exist – because of deep erosion.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañuy amaati fii ak jëfu tuuma bi?","The correct answer is **B: Siiwal ay nataal** (Problems with nationality/citizenship).

Here's why:

The passage discusses issues with people's citizenship and how they are being investigated, particularly focusing on those with Scottish roots who may have fraudulently obtained citizenship.  Pamela Ferguson's statement directly refers to ""Taskati xibaar yi dañoo niroog kuy dox ci buum gu wóorul su ñu siiwalee nataal ak yeneeni ñi ñu duut baaraam"" – meaning cases where people are questioned about their nationality and ancestry. The entire text revolves around this central theme of citizenship problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeneeni addu** (Family matters) – While ancestry is mentioned, the focus isn't on general family issues. It's specifically about the legitimacy of citizenship claims.
* **C: Ay waxtaan ci séedey gët yi** (Issues with legal proceedings) – Legal proceedings *are* happening, but they are a *result* of the nationality issues, not the core problem itself.
* **D: Ay siiwalug mbóot** (Financial problems) – The passage doesn’t mention financial issues.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan nekkul ab jafe-jafe ci jaaykat yi fimne nii?","The correct answer is **C: Tàccaayu galaas gi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""buñu sukkandiko ci Pittman, mooy bi gëna bon ñiy dém ci géej gi ñoo ko moomoon ci 15 at yi weesu."" This translates to ""The issue discussed with Pittman is the one about those who are late to work, those who arrive after 15 minutes.""
* **The question asks:** What was discussed in the text, relating to frequent lateness?
* **""Tàccaayu galaas gi""** means ""the problem of lateness"" or ""the issue of being late."" This directly corresponds to the issue discussed with Pittman.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Anami jawwu yu tàr:**  Means ""important things to say"" - not specifically about lateness.
* **B: Dayoob galaas:** Means ""work lateness"" - too general, doesn't capture the specific focus on those *after* 15 minutes.
* **D: Seeyug galaas gi:** Means ""the cause of lateness"" - the passage discusses *who* is late, not *why*.



"
"Suñ ci dollee galas gi, lan mooy indi ay lorange ci liñuy jéema def ay sowetaas?","The correct answer is **A: Ñakkum jumtukaay (Some difficulties)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes Dolli's difficulties with the gala.** It states she ""wàdd"" (struggled) and mentions problems (""dafa baare jeego wàllu yi"" - there were problems with things).  It further explains Pittman helped her overcome issues to be able to attend, suggesting challenges existed.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Anami jawwu (They were beautiful):** The passage doesn't focus on the beauty of the gala, but on the *effort* to get Dolli there.
    * **C: Ñakkum ndimbal (Some advantages):** The passage speaks of overcoming obstacles, not advantages.
    * **D: Rëbkat yi (The relatives):** The relatives aren't the central topic; Dolli's struggle and Pittman's help are.

* **The question (Q) asks about the difficulties experienced *during* preparing for the gala.**  ""Ñakkum jumtukaay"" best reflects those challenges described in the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
Ban gëm-gëm la Roberts baña nangoo weral?,"The correct answer is **B: Solos dogal yu dëppoo ak li am Tirbinaal bu mag bi** (Legal issues related to what the Supreme Court decided).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the legal ramifications of the Roe v. Wade decision and the Supreme Court's role in overturning it.** It discusses rights, privacy, and legal precedents.  Roberts' comments are about the *legal* fallout of the decision.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Xalaat yu rafet yi wara am ci waxtaan yi** (Situations of comfort that exist in times) - This is completely unrelated to the passage.
    * **C: Ndorteelu dundu** (Empty talk) -  The passage presents specific legal arguments, not just empty talk.
    * **D: Sañ-sañu sutura** (Storytelling) - While Roberts *made* statements, the core of the passage is about the legal consequences.

Therefore, option B best reflects the central theme of the passage and what Roberts is discussing.



"
Ban tomb la Roberts jàpp ni dafa wuute woon ak xalaat yu baax yi ci waxtaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Dogalu Roe v. Wade**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly discusses the overturning of Roe v. Wade.** It states Roberts discussed how the decision was a ""fundamental shift in the law"" and mentions the Supreme Court's role in overturning it.
* **The passage focuses on the legal and ethical implications of this specific case.**  The other options are too broad or don't relate directly to the central theme of the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dëppoo yu am ci Tirbinaal bu mag bi (Issues in the High Court):** While the case *went* to the Supreme Court, the passage isn't about general issues before the court, but specifically Roe v. Wade.
* **C: Sañ-sañ sutura buñu juñju (Future constitutional issues):**  The passage talks about a *past* decision and its consequences, not future issues.
* **D: Xejjiku bi am si kaa yi (Problems that have been around for a while):** This is too vague and doesn't specifically relate to the topic of the text.



"
Fan la ñaari weti leeraay nekkee di takk?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci kaw asamaan si**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samp nañu ñaari faisceau lumière yuy niit asmaan si su guddi jotee."" This translates to ""Then they directed a beam of light up into the sky, it was very beautiful.""  The question asks *where* they directed the light. The passage clearly states ""asamaan si"" (into the sky).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci biir dëkk bi:**  The passage mentions the shop (""dëkk bi"") but doesn't say the light was directed *at* it.
* **C: Ci tànnéefi sànni bu njëkk bi:** This refers to the first floor, but the passage doesn't mention directing light there.
* **D: Ci diggu memorial park:**  While a park is mentioned as a future addition, the light wasn't directed at it.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan lañu tabax etaas yu maga mag yi ci barab bi?","The correct answer is **B: Bi 8:46 ci suba jotee.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What happened in the text, when did they see the light beams in the sky?""
* **The text states:** ""P: Ci bi 8:46 ci suba joté dëkk bi yepp noppina, di màndargaal waxtu wi roppalaan bu njëkk bi mbëkkée jubbluwayam... Samp nañu ñaari faisceau lumière yuy niit asmaan si su guddi jotee.""  (Translation: ""At 8:46 in the morning the building collapsed, and the first thing we saw was a huge cloud of dust... Then we saw light beams appear in the sky as if from a god."")

The text *specifically* links the appearance of the light beams to the time 8:46 in the morning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci diggu bis bi** (In the second part) -  This is too vague and doesn't answer *when* the beams were seen.
* **C: Ci guddi gi** (From the god) - This describes *how* the beams appeared (as if from a god), not *when*.
* **D: Tabax baa ngi wey** (The dust had gone) - This refers to the dust cloud, not the light beams.



"
Yan xibaar ñooy wone ni The Seven Sisters ay xeer yu mag lañu?,"The correct answer is **B: Rëdd buy xaajale buntu xeer yu mag yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nataal efararuus wonena coppite ci jawwu ji guddi ak bëcëg di wone ay bërë la."" (Natural formations exist as cliffs on the east and south sides.) and then goes on to describe how they were formed, linking them to the ""Seven Sisters.""  This indicates the ""Seven Sisters"" *are* geological formations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Coppitey temperatiir** (Temperature cliffs) - The text doesn't mention temperature.
*   **C: Lanketi géologue yi** (Geologists' studies) - While a geologist is mentioned, the question asks *what* the Seven Sisters are, not about studying them.
*   **D: Nataali xeer yu mag yi ci Suuf si** (Natural geological formations in the South) - This is partially true, but the formations exist on *both* the east *and* south sides, and doesn't fully capture what the Seven Sisters *are*.



"
Nan lañuy saytoo doxaliinu thermal bu Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **D: Gëstub xeer yu mag yi ci Suuf si**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Séni doxalin nirowul ak binék ci suuf biy yamalé tangay bi, waye amna doolé ak kamb yu xoot yi ci suuf si...""  This translates to: ""Thermal imaging detected and revealed anomalies with the hot springs on the south slope...""

This directly refers to thermal imaging (doxaliinu thermal) being used to detect hot springs (xeer yu mag) on the south slope (Suuf si).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nataali infrarouge:** While infrared is related to thermal imaging, the text specifically mentions the *detection* of hot springs, not just infrared radiation.
*   **B: Pax yu xóot ci ëtt bi:** This refers to hot springs in general, but doesn't answer *how* they were detected.
*   **C: Rëddu diggu xeer yu mag yi:** This means ""location of hot springs"", again, not *how* they were found.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban wax bu aju ci ki ñu njort moo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **A: Dafa jëfandikoo ab ndamaar ci jamonoy cong bi**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) discusses someone being falsely accused and suffering due to misunderstandings.**  The speaker is lamenting that people are quickly judging them based on their Uighur background, even though they haven't done anything wrong.  They are being ""judged"" for who they *are* rather than for their actions.
* **Option A (""Dafa jëfandikoo ab ndamaar ci jamonoy cong bi"" - ""People quickly judge and accuse based on societal beliefs"")** directly reflects this theme of hasty judgment and prejudice.  It speaks to the core problem presented in the passage.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B (""Wax nañu ni dafa kalaatel ab bomb"" - ""They say I'm a terrorist"")** - While the passage implies negative perceptions, it doesn't explicitly mention being called a terrorist. It's a leap in interpretation.
    * **C (""Njiit yi xam nañu waaso bimu bokk"" - ""People think I'm not a good person"")** - Too general.  The passage is about *why* they are perceived negatively (their ethnicity) not just that they *are* perceived negatively.
    * **D (""Gaañu ñu ko woon"" - ""They are talking about it"")** - Simply states people are talking, which doesn’t capture the core issue of wrongful accusation and prejudice.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer to the question."
Yan xibaar yu àju ci cong bi la njiit yi firndeel?,"The correct answer is **A: Xibaari raññeekaayi complice yi** (The accomplices are being investigated).

Here's why:

* **P's text describes an investigation.** It talks about someone being looked into (""njorton ni mo kalatélo""), and the potential for severe consequences (""turam ba léegi kilifa yi xamu nu ko"").  The text also alludes to a complex situation involving the Uighur people.
* **Q asks about what is being investigated.** (""Yan xibaar yu àju ci cong bi la njiit yi firndeel?"" - What is being urgently investigated in this case?).
* **Option A** directly addresses this: it states that ""accomplices"" are being investigated. This fits the context of the original text perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waaso ki ñuy tuumal** (It's good that you are speaking) - This doesn't relate to the investigative tone of the passage.
* **C: Li ñu nàmm ci cong bi** (They are naming the case) - While naming a case *could* happen during an investigation, it's not the core focus described in P.
* **D: Tur ak santu ki ñuy tuumal** (Truth and peace are what you are speaking) -  Similar to B, this is a philosophical statement that doesn't fit the context.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and contextually accurate answer."
Ban ekip mooy futbal ci joŋante buñuy amal ca Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Afrique du Sud ak Australie**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...su Springboks di jogante ak Óstraali."" ( ""...Springboks will play against Australia"").  Springboks is the nickname for the South African rugby team, and ""Óstraali"" is Australia.  

The question asks which teams will play football (rugby is the sport being discussed) at Ellis Park. The passage clearly states South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.



"
Fan la waa Springboks di defee seen joŋante bi ci topp?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pàcc mu mujju bi jëm ci mboolem jongante yi dina ñu ko amal ci bërëb Ellis Park ca Johannesburg ayubés bidi ñëw, su Springboks di jogante ak Óstraali."" 

This translates to: ""The next match they lost was at Ellis Park in Johannesburg a few days later, where Springboks played against Australia.""  Therefore, the Springboks' next match (and thus their opportunity to ""defend their honor"") was in Johannesburg against Australia.



"
Ak yan mbir la yi may waaja lim la station spatiale bi amal ay jafe-jafe bimuy def mission bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Weyal digante bu baax bi ak meykati doole yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) talks about docking (doxalinam) and maneuvering in space (liggéey bërëb jawwu).** It mentions needing to correct course (""dem ci jawwu di jex"").
* **Option A (""Weyal digante bu baax bi ak meykati doole yi"" - Good antennas and communication systems)** directly addresses the need for communication and control during these maneuvers – essential for docking and staying on course.
* **The question (Q) asks about what's needed for a space station mission.**  Good communication is fundamental to any space mission.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Teye ab gyroscope (A gyroscope)** - Gyroscopes are *part* of the system, but not the overarching need.  They help with orientation, but you need to *communicate* and *control* to use them effectively.
* **C: Dekkal ab jet (Jets)** - Jets are for propulsion, not for the fundamental need to stay connected and controlled.
* **D: Jotaat ci doxaliin bu jaar yoon (Planning for a year-long docking)** - While planning is important, it doesn't answer the *immediate* need for the mission to function.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and directly related answer based on the information provided in the passage and the question."
"Sunu sukandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo nekkoon jubluwaayu mission wu station spatiale bi?","The correct answer is **A: Seet ab gyroscope bu reer**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) talks about maintaining balance (""baldufa"") and orientation (""liggéey"") during space travel (""jawwu"").** It mentions Sharipov's expertise in maintaining a normal situation (""sitiyasayon bu normaal bi"").
* **Gyroscopes are crucial for maintaining balance and orientation in space.** They are used to control the attitude of spacecraft.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Jege ñuy dooleel tëraliin wi:**  (Something about radio waves) -  While communication is important in space, it doesn't directly address the balance/orientation issue.
    * **C: Def ab génn ci espace bi:** (Walking in space) -  Astronauts do walk in space, but this doesn't relate to *how* they maintain their orientation.
    * **D: Dekkal jet yi:** (Jets) - Jets are used for propulsion and maneuvering, but gyroscopes are the primary system for *stabilizing* and maintaining orientation.

Therefore, the passage strongly suggests the question is about maintaining balance in space, and a gyroscope is the key technology for that.



"
Ban ci yile wax bu àju ci kaa bi mo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **A: Yoon daf ko toppoon ci réew mi nga xamantane AOL mooy nekkoon siège bi** (This happened in the state where AOL was headquartered).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dañoo toppoon mbir mi ci Virginia..."" (The incident happened in Virginia...).  It then connects this to AOL being the provider and the beginning of spam issues.
* **The question asks:** What was the significance of the location where it happened?
* **Option A** directly answers this, stating Virginia was where AOL was based (""siège bi"" means headquarters).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Joxe woon nañu ab daan** (People began to receive emails) - While true, it's a *result* of the event, not the significance of the *location*.
* **C: Jëfandikoo woon nañu ateb yoon ci imelu saay-saay yi ci dosiyee bi** (They started to find responses to these emails in the file) - This is detail *about* the spam, not the location's importance.
* **D: Tuumal nañu AOL** (They blamed AOL) -  Again, a consequence, not the significance of the Virginia location.



"
Ban ci yile wax mooy xamle dosiyee bi bu baax?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL moo tambali topp kaa bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dañoo toppoon mbir mi ci Virginia ndax mooy barab bi ki daan joxe sarwiisi Internet AOL dëkkoon, kër gi tambali tuuma yi.""  This translates to: ""The damage caused by this man in Virginia is the result of using AOL internet service, and the companies are responsible.""  Therefore, AOL *was* responsible for the spam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tuumal nañu AOL ni dafay amal séddale buñu sakku wul:** This means ""They accused AOL of not being able to filter well."" While implied, the passage doesn't explicitly state an *accusation*, it states responsibility.
* **B: Mbir mi mo ngi soxaloon ñaari joxekati sàrwiis internet yu mag:** This means ""This man is being sued for using many internet services."" The passage focuses specifically on AOL.
* **C: Ci atum 2003 lañu tambali woon topp kaa bi:** This means ""They were responsible in 2003."" While 2003 is mentioned, it's about the *start* of the spam problem, not when responsibility was assigned.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban club moo tambaliwul futbal netti pàcc ci ginnaaw?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

Here's why:

The text states Vidal went to Barça (""Vidal te mu am 28-at dem na Barça..."") and then played a game against Seville. The question asks which club is mentioned as playing against another in the passage. Barça is the club Vidal plays for and the one involved in the game with Seville.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Seville** - While Seville is *in* the game, the question asks which club *is* playing.
*   **B: Catalane** - Catalane refers to a language and culture, not a football club.
*   **D: Capital** - ""Capital"" refers to the city (Barcelona) not a club.



"
Ñaata match la Vidal joué ak waa Barça?,"The text states: ""Vidal te mu am 28-at dem na Barça ñetti at ci ginnaaw, jóge Seville."" This translates to ""Vidal played 28 games for Barça before joining Seville.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 49** is not mentioned in the text. The closest option to the number given in the text is **D: 29**, which is the most plausible answer given the options, although it's slightly off from the stated ""28"". However, without more context, we must choose the closest available option.

**Therefore, the answer is D: 29**
"
Ban ekip la doon fubalal ci match bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bologne**.

Here's why:

The text states ""...seen joŋante ak Bolonia ci dimanche ji"" (they will play against Bologna on Sunday) and ""...match buñu wara amal bisu Dibeer seen digante ak Boloña"" (the match will be a preparation for their match against Bologna).  This clearly indicates Bologna is one of the teams playing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jarque** - Jarque is a person (likely a trainer), not a team.
*   **C: Coverciano** - Coverciano is a location (training center in Italy).
*   **D: Italie** - Italie is a country, not a team.



"
Lu tax Jarque nekk ci otel bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Dafa amoon ab ndajem pré-saison**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mingi daloon ci hôtel bi équipe bi dal laata ñuy amal seen joŋante ak Bolonia ci dimanche ji. Mu dëkkoon ci otelu ekip bi laata ab match buñu wara amal bisu Dibeer seen digante ak Boloña.""

This translates to: ""Many players in the team's hotel came to do their training in preparation for their match against Bologna on Sunday. He stayed in the team hotel to prepare for the match but to continue their pre-season training with Bologna.""

This clearly indicates Jarque is at the hotel for *pre-season training* (ndajem pré-saison).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dafa amoon limu daan jéema def:** (He came because many people came) - The text doesn't focus on *why* he came, but *what* he's doing.
*   **C: Dafa amoon match Dibeer:** (He came for the Dibeer match) -  The text says he's there *in addition to* preparing for the Dibeer match, to continue pre-season work.
*   **D: Dafa nekkoon di tàggatu ak Bologne:** (He is there to train with Bologna) - While they train *with* Bologna, the primary purpose is pre-season, not just training with the other team.



"
Lu tax këru géophysique bu Jakarta joxewul ab dankaafu?,"The correct answer is **A: Amul benn fitna wu tsunami**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""bu ñu sukkandikoo ci agence de géophysique bu Jakarta, kenn du amal benn àddu ci tsunami..."" (they announced from the geophysics agency in Jakarta that there is a threat of a tsunami...)
* **The question asks:** What did the Jakarta geophysics agency announce?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngir moytu jaxasoo am ci ñi fa dëkkee:** (To help people in the villages) - While the agency *might* want to help, the passage doesn't state this was the announcement.
* **C: Ngir moytu mu laal kër yi ci dëkk bi:** (To help move houses in the village) - This is also not mentioned in the passage as the announcement.
* **D: Dëppoowul ak càkkutéefi këru magnitude bi ngir yëngu-yëngu suuf yi:** (Reporting and calculating the magnitude for future studies) -  While the agency *does* this work, the passage focuses on the *announcement* made, which was about the tsunami threat.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la yëngu-yëngu suuf si waral?","The correct answer is **B: Ab fitnaalu tsunami**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amul benn àddu buñu def ci tsunami..."" (The alert was given about a tsunami...) and then explains it was triggered by an earthquake.
* **The question asks:** What was the main subject of the alert?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dafa tiitël ñi fa dëkk:** (People leaving their homes) - This is a *result* of the alert, not the alert itself.
* **C: Ab dankaafu buñu joxe:** (A strong earthquake) - The earthquake *caused* the alert, but the alert was *about* the tsunami.
* **D: Ab 6.5 ci eselu magnitude bi:** (6.5 on the magnitude scale) - This describes the earthquake, not the alert.

Therefore, the alert was specifically *about* the potential for a tsunami.



"
Ban ci yile moo mey waral liggéeyu naaj wi ak yeneen biddeew yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Leeraay ak flux wu plasma**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""...Leeraay ak wëndeelu lañu jëfandikoo ngir xam nimero Rossby bu bideew bu nekk, bi nga xam ni moo nekk ci flux bu plasma bi.""  This translates to ""Leeraay and wëndeelu are used to understand the Rossby number of a given fluid, if you know it exists in the plasma flux.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Limu Rossy, wërgël ak dëppandi magnetique:** While Rossby number *is* mentioned, 'wërgël' (energy) and 'dëppandi magnetique' (magnetic dependence) aren't directly linked as key components for understanding it in the text.
* **C: Wërgël ak leeraay:** Energy is not specifically stated as a key component.
* **D: Leeraay, limu Rossby ak wër:** 'Wër' (air) is not mentioned in the passage and isn't relevant to the discussion of plasma and fluid dynamics.



"
Nan lañuy def ngir xam limu Rossby wu benn biddeew?,"The correct answer is **B: Dayoob flux wu plasma**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly states: ""...seeni leeraay, seeni wëndeelu, te du leneen. Leeraay ak wëndeelu lañu jëfandikoo ngir xam nimero Rossby bu bideew bu nekk, **bi nga xam ni moo nekk ci flux bu plasma bi.**""  This translates to ""...their speed, their direction, and their length. Speed and direction are used to understand the Rossby number of a given current, **by knowing that it exists in the plasma flux.**""

Therefore, understanding the plasma flux is key to determining the Rossby number of a current.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Leeraay ak wërgël (Speed and direction):** While speed and direction *help* calculate the Rossby number, they aren't the fundamental thing you need to *know* it exists.
*   **C: Tolluwaay liggéey bi (A specific light wavelength):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Dayoob dêpëndi magnetique (Magnetic dependence):** While the passage mentions magnetic fields (""magnetic melokaan""), it doesn't state that magnetic dependence is what's needed to understand the Rossby number.



"
Ban pursantaasu nit yuñu laaj moo nangu Australie doon ab repubique ci saasi?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 ci téémeer bo jël**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""29 ci téémeer dañu xalaat ni Óstraali warna doon republik ci li gaaw"" which translates to ""On December 29th, it was reported that Australia wanted to become a republic.""  This indicates that 29% of the population wanted Australia to become a republic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 31 ci téemer bo jël** - The text says on December 31st, it was reported Australia *did not* want to become a republic.
*   **C: 8 ci téemer bo jël** - This number isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **D: 34 ci téemer bo jël** - This refers to the number of people who participated in the poll, not the percentage who wanted a republic.



"
"Ci xalaatu Julie Gillard, kañ la Autralie wara doon ab république?","The correct answer is **B: Su nguuru Reine Elisabeth II jeexee** (Because of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Njiitu jëwrin gi fi nekkandi di Julia Gillard waxna ci biir campagne électorale fédérale bu 2010 ni dafa yaakaaroon ni Australie dafa wara nekk ab république ginaaw bi nguuru reine Elizabeth II jeexee.""  This directly translates to: ""Julia Gillard's statement during the 2010 federal election campaign was that Australia was not ready to become a republic because of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Numu gëna gaawee** (No specific reason) - The text *does* give a reason.
*   **C: Mukk** (False) - The text explicitly states a reason.
*   **D: Su palum njiitu federaal bi jeexee** (Because of the previous federal election) - While the statement was *made* during the election, the *reason* given was the Queen's reign, not the election itself.



"
Ban bootaay lañu nekk di amal ab atéb yoon?,"The correct answer is **B: Fondation bu Komen**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Leslie Aun, ku yor kaddu Komen Foundation, neena mbootaay bi dafa teg ab tërëlin bu bees..."" (Leslie Aun, who works for the Komen Foundation, leads the teams...). This directly identifies the Komen Foundation as the organization with teams working on this issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Komité bi yor wallum Enersi ak Jënd ak Jaay bu Kër gi** - While mentioned later in the passage regarding Cliff Stearns, it's not the organization *leading* the teams initially discussed.
*   **C: Mbirum waajur buñu waajal** - This option is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Sous-comité wu saytu ak anket** - This option is also not mentioned in the text.



"
Cliff Stearns moo jiite ban comité?,"The correct answer is **A: The House Energy ak Commerce Committee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mu nekkee njiitu Komite bi suuf Xool bi ak Ceytu gi, mu nekk ci suufu kilifteteef Këru Enersi ak Komite Njaay.""  This directly translates to ""...he served on the Energy and Commerce Committee...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The Komen Foundation:** The text discusses the Komen Foundation's *relationship* to Planned Parenthood, but Stearns didn't serve on it.
* **C: Mbirum waajur buñu waajal:** This doesn't appear in the text and isn't relevant.
* **D: Comité de surveillance ak lanket:** While oversight is involved, the specific committee named in the text is Energy and Commerce.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo amul woon ci doomu Swiss bu jigéen bi?","The correct answer is **C: 5 nit ñoo ko sàkku woon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ni nu tuumaal Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar lanu ko tuddee, Rampron Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar ak Vishnu Kanjar."" This translates to ""There were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar and their associates, Rampron Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.""  This lists five individuals.

The Inspector's statement says they stole things *from* Switzerland, and the question asks how many people were involved in the theft *from* Switzerland. Therefore, the answer is 5.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gis nañu moomeelam yuñu sàccoon** - ""They stole their belongings."" This is too general and doesn't answer the *how many* question.
* **B: Dañ ko reyoon** - ""They were arrested.""  This isn't what the question is asking.
* **D: Dañoo sàccoon telefonam ak ordinatëër portabalam** - ""They stole phones and laptops."" This details *what* was stolen, not *who* did the stealing.



"
Ban kër lañu jox Taiwan Sustainable Award ci atum 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states that ASUS won the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007: ""...buñu saragalee ASUS ci atum 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award bu ko Direktër bi di Yuan bu Réewu Siin jox."" (won the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award by the Director of the Executive Yuan).



"

The text clearly states: ""Waaye marsé buy jëfandikoo ordinaatër portaabal dina wuute bu baax..."" which translates to ""And it was the first portable computer..."" 

Therefore, ASUS Eee PC is a portable computer."
Kan moo waraloon wayndare post yi reeroon?,"The correct answer is **A: Liggéeykati post yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Démb, këru liggéyukaayu post bi dem nañu ci mejaa yi ngir jéggalu askan wi ginaaw bi ñu gisee ni xale bu góor bi dafa nëbboon lu ëpp 600 document yu waa post, muy tolloo ak 429 cartes postaalu ndokkale ci at mu bees mi, yoo xamni seeni booroom jotu ñu ko.""

This translates to: ""Then, several postal workers put them on the tables to process the large amount of mail they saw, including the generous man who was sending over 600 pieces of mail, specifically 429 postcards addressed to me, according to what his superiors told them.""

The question asks *who* was handling the mail. The passage directly identifies **liggéeykati post yi** (postal workers) as the ones handling and processing the mail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ab kuréelu nit yu dëkk Obanazawa:** While the postcards are *going to* people in Obanazawa, the passage doesn't say the people *of* Obanazawa are handling the mail.
*   **C: Ab xale bu góor:** The generous man is *sending* the mail, not handling it.
*   **D: Joxekati xibaar yi:** The passage doesn't mention anyone involved in delivery. It focuses on the processing at the post office.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo demoon jeggali ci li àju ci wayndare yi reer?","The correct answer is **A: Ñi fa dëkk (The shopkeepers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jafe-jafe baa ngi tàmbali bisu 1 janvier bi mu amee ñenn ci **ñi fa dëkk** ñu tàmbali ñaxtu..."" (The problem started on January 1st when someone complained to **the shopkeepers** who usually handle...).  The entire problem stems from complaints *to* the shopkeepers regarding the postcards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xale bu góor bi (The elderly man):** The elderly man is *receiving* the postcards, he isn't the source of the problem or the initial point of contact.
* **C: Mejaa yi (The tables):** The tables are just where the postcards were placed – they're not involved in the initial complaint.
* **D: Biro post bu Obanazawa (The Obanazawa Post Office):** The post office *processes* the postcards, but the initial issue and complaint started with the shopkeepers.



"
Kañ la Del Potro wara wut saafara ci jafe-jafe bi ci mbaggam?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci set bu njëkk bi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Del Porto moo jiitu woon ci ñaareelu set bi, waaye loolu dafa lajoon itam tuuti tollole bimu àggee ci 6-6."" This translates to: ""Del Porto won in the third set, but this was after a difficult tiebreak at 6-6.""

Therefore, Del Porto won the tiebreak *in the first set* (ñaareelu set bi meaning the third set in this context as the match was likely best of 5).  The text doesn't mention tiebreaks in other sets.



"
Lan mo nekoon resultat wu tie break bu njëkk bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Murray moo ko ñakkoon ci set bu njëkk bi** (Murray won the first set).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Murray ñakk na pacc gu njëkk gi..."" which translates to ""Murray won the first set...""
* The rest of the text describes the subsequent sets and a tie-break, but explicitly states Murray won the *first* set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del Potro daf ko ñakkoon bimu gaañoo:** The text doesn't say Del Potro won any sets initially; it mentions a tie-break later.
* **C: Murrary moo jëloon ndam li ci ñaareelu set bi:**  This implies Murray lost in the first set, which contradicts the text.
* **D: Del Pedro moo jëloon ndam li ci ñaareelu set bi:**  This implies Del Potro lost in the first set, which contradicts the text.



"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, kan, ci anam bu xejjiku, moo exposé wu ci ab malaat?","The correct answer is **A: Gornoor bi** (The Governor).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gornoor bi wax na itam, """"Tey, jàng nañu ni yenn lekool yu am ay ndongo yu mag ràññee nañ leen niki dañoo jokkook aji feebar bi."""" "" (The Governor also said, ""Yes, let us ensure that the schools with many problems are given the necessary resources to overcome the current fever."")
* This quote directly indicates the Governor is making a statement about a problem (schools with issues) and a proposed solution (resources). This aligns with the question asking who is exposing a problem related to education/schools.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xale yi** (The students) - The passage doesn't mention students exposing a problem.
* **C: Njiiti Texas yi** (The people of Texas) - While the passage mentions Texas, it doesn't say the people are making an exposé.
* **D: Situwayee yi ci dëkk bi** (The situation in the store) - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban garanti la gornoor bi joxewul bimuy wax ak doomi réewi Texas yi?","The correct answer is **B: Ñoo ngi def luñu mën ngir àar kaarànge askan wi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gornoor bi wax na itam, """"Tey, jàng nañu ni yenn lekool yu am ay ndongo yu mag ràññee nañ leen niki dañoo jokkook aji feebar bi."""" ""  This translates to ""The governor also said, 'Yes, send our schools with many resources so they can succeed in the current competition.'""

This directly indicates the governor is advocating for sending resources to schools to help them compete (and likely improve) within the state of Texas.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sistem bi moo ngi dox bu baax** (The system is working well) - The passage doesn't discuss the overall system working well; it focuses on a need for improvement.
* **C: Am nañu ay jumtukaay yu doy ngir indi ay saafara** (There are opportunities to explore travel) - This is unrelated to the text's content.
* **D: Kaa bi garawul** (The matter is complicated) - While issues can be complicated, the governor's statement points to a specific solution (more resources), not just complexity.



"
Ban costéefu xibaaru parodik la ñaari ndongoy UW sosoon?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The Onion nekk na ampiir bu am solo ci empiiru parodi..."" (The Onion became a solo empire in the empire of parody...).  It goes on to describe its success and influence. The other options are mentioned *as being influenced by* the parodies of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, but The Onion is presented as the original, foundational source of that parody.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët wi, ban ci mbir yii mo bokkul ci àmpiir parodik bu The Onion?","The correct answer is **C: ab daluweb**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ak sumb buñu móol, ab daluweb bu xëccoon 5 000 000 gan ci weeru Oktoobar, ay siiwali bopp...""  This translates to ""...and a significant amount, a website with 5,000,000 hits in October, very popular...""

This clearly indicates that a website is a key component of The Onion's empire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ab atlas u addina:** While the passage mentions an ""Atlas buñu jagleel addina bi"", it's presented as *one* thing The Onion does, not the core of its empire.
*   **B: Ab film:** The passage doesn't mention films.
*   **D: Téere buñ imprime:** The passage doesn’t explicitly say they print materials, and focuses on the digital presence (website).



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la poliis bi nekkoon di gardé?","The correct answer is **C: Buntu Downing Street**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fippu gi door ci 11:00 ci Whitehall ci digganté takk dérr yi ak ci buntu Downing Street..."" which translates to ""The protesters arrived at 11:00 on Whitehall, near the entrance and in front of Downing Street..."".  The police were needed to manage the crowd and traffic *around* Downing Street.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Trafalgar Square:** The protesters *passed through* Trafalgar Square, but it wasn't the location the police were guarding.
*   **B: The Spring Forum:** This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Otelu Grand Connaught Rooms:** This is where the Conservatives were meeting, the protesters were *going to* it, but the police were guarding Downing Street.



"
Ci ban waxtu la poliis bi laaj wey-fippu yi ñu dem ngir moytu ab ambuteyaasu dem ak dikk bu bees?,"The correct answer is **D: Bi 11:20 jotee**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bi 11:20 jotee, poliis bi laaj na ñiy ñaxtu ñu dellu ci wetu torotuwaar bi, di xamle ni dañoo soxlawoon peese àqu ñaxtu ak tarafik bi nekkoon di yokk.""  This directly translates to ""At 11:20, the police began to direct the protesters to keep them from disturbing the peace and traffic.""

Therefore, the police intervened with the protesters around 11:20.



"
Lan moo dëggu ci gëstu gi Dr. Ehud Ur def?,"The correct answer is **A: Njuréefi yi mên nañu am njariñ ci malaat yi amee jabet type 1 bu sooga feeñ.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...di waxni geestu yi amugnu solo dara ci nit yi am jabétu Type 1."" This translates to ""...he states that children are significantly better off with Type 1 diabetes.""  This directly supports the idea that research shows benefits for children with Type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yenn jinax yu njëkk yi amatu ñu jabet:**  The text doesn't focus on the first diagnoses of diabetes, but rather the well-being of those *with* it.
* **C: Amna yaakaar ni njuréef yi mën nañu doon ab saafara:** The text doesn’t talk about the future or potential cures.
* **D: Yenn jinax yu amul woon jabet dañoo am jabet léegi:**  This is not mentioned in the text.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci lan la Dr. Ur am ay sikki sakka?","The correct answer is **A: Ndax njuréef yi am nañu solo ci malaat yu am jabet Type 1.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...di waxni geestu yi amugnu solo dara ci nit yi am jabétu Type 1.""  This directly translates to ""he says that the studies show a connection with people with Type 1 diabetes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Su ab paj mënee nekk:** The passage doesn't discuss the cost of research.
* **C: Xalaati yeneen aji-xarañ yi ci li àju ci am paj:** The passage doesn't focus on the experiences of family members.
* **D: Sudee jinax yu amul jabet dañuy wey ci anam boobu:** The passage doesn't talk about the future of diabetes treatment.

Ban ci yile wax moo dul xamle ci anam gu leer aksidaŋu Roplaanu CG4684?,"The correct answer is **A: Roplaan bi mënul woon wàcc ndax anamu jawwu ji**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Démb Twin Otter jéem na wàcci ci Kokoda doon vol biñ tudee Airlines PNG Flight CG4684, waaye njëkkoon na jota moy.""  This translates to ""The Twin Otter plane took off from Kokoda on a flight by Airlines PNG Flight CG4684, but didn't return."" This directly implies the plane is missing and everyone is worried.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roplaan bi dafa daanu ci barab bu sori lool:** (The plane is currently moving slowly on the ground) - The passage describes a crash, not a slow movement.
* **C: Roplaan bi jéem na wàcc ñetti yoon laata muy daanu:** (The plane took off successfully and is moving quickly) -  The passage explicitly states it *didn't* return.
* **D: Seetug barab bi aksidaŋ bi amee anami jawwu ji ñoo ko tere antu:** (The site of the crash is causing a lot of anxiety for people to get there) - While there *is* anxiety, the primary fact is the plane is missing.



"
Lan moo waral Roplan CG4684 fomm wàccam?,"The correct answer is **A: Mënu ñu woon àgg ci barabu wàccukaay bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Barabu aksidaŋ bi xam nañ ko tey te dafa jafe àgg ba da ñu yónnee ay alkati ci àll bi ngir ñu mëna dem ci barab yi te seet ndax am na ñu ciy dundu ba tey.""  This translates to: ""The accident was serious and caused damage, but they managed to get passengers out to the ground to move to other places and continue their journey because there were people to help them.""

This directly indicates that passengers were evacuated *because of* the accident, and are now being moved to other transport. This aligns with option A (""They are now safe in the evacuation area"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dafa amoon yeneen roplaan yu bari ci kanamu CG4684:** The passage doesn't mention other planes arriving.
* **C: Dañoo soppi woon yoonu roplaan bi ngir mu dem Kokoda:** The passage states the plane *crashed* - it won’t be continuing to Kokoda.
* **D: Anami jawwu ji baaxu ñu woon:** The passage does not mention how many people were on board.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Benn ci tëjukaaayu palanteer yi mujj naa toj nu daldi tàmbali di genn ci palanteer.”  This translates to ""Among the features of the palanteer, it can show you things happening *in* the palanteer.""
* **This means** Kowal is saying the palanteer can show you what's going on *within* itself, not just outside through the windows.  He's pointing out a capability of seeing things *on* the palanteer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mujj na dajji palanteer bi:** (It can have the palanteer) - This isn't what the passage says.
* **B: Mujj gi jotul woon am gaañu-gaañu:** (It's full of secrets) - While implied, the passage specifically highlights *how* it reveals things, not that it's simply full of secrets.
* **C: Dafa dalmm ab siis bi muy jéema génn:** (It can show you things happening outside) - The passage specifically contrasts seeing through the windows with seeing *on* the palanteer itself.



"
Lu tax xayma li tempête tropicale Danielle mëna waral doon lu jafe?,"The correct answer is **A: Da ñoo sentu woon tempête bi soppeeku doon ab ouragan.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Scientifique yiy liggéey ci National Hurricane Center wax nañu ni Danielle dina sopeku ngelaane bu mag fileek àllarba.""  This translates to ""Scientists at the National Hurricane Center say Danielle has the potential to become a hurricane.""  This directly answers the question about what the storm *could* become.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't mention people being affected by the winds.
* **C:** The passage doesn't say the storm is moving quickly.
* **D:** The passage says the storm is 3,000 miles from Miami, not *near* Miami.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax ci Tempête Tropical Danielle moo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **B: Ci Océan Atlantik lañ ko defaree** (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""forméwu na ci penku Ocean Atlantik"" (formed in the central Atlantic Ocean). This is a direct statement from the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xamu ñu limu mêna waral ci Caraîbes yi** (They are hoping it moves towards the Caribbean) - The passage says it *won't* likely hit the Caribbean.
* **C: Mën na doon ab ouragan** (It might become a hurricane) - While possible, the passage only says scientists don't expect it to strengthen significantly.
* **D: Dafa jege wàccukaay bi** (It's moving very fast) - The passage says it has winds of 40 mph, but doesn't emphasize its speed as a key detail.

Jar na ragal ni malaat yi mêna wey di wàll ay nit yu bari soo toppee yi ngay faral di def bis bu nekk su màndarga girip yi weyee di woyof."" This translates to ""It is a serious matter. There is concern that illnesses can spread rapidly among many people, especially due to the spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus. ""  The passage highlights the worry about the *spread* of the virus, implying that measures are being taken to *combat* that spread (woyof - to fight/combat).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dafa wara doon ludul rey lu bari:** (They are trying to do a lot of things) - While true in a general sense, the passage doesn't focus on *what* they're doing, but the *reason* for concern.
* **C: Dañoo wara wàll nit yu bari:** (They are trying to protect many people) - This is a consequence of fighting the spread, not the main point of the text.
* **D: Xale yi war nañu am ay mandarga:** (Patients have problems) - The passage is about preventing the problem from worsening, not just acknowledging existing cases.



Therefore, **B** best reflects the core concern expressed in the passage – the need to fight against the spread of the bird flu."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban digante la soriwaayu Fuji tolloon ak Typhon?","The correct answer is **A: 9 kilomeetar**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...bëtu Morakot mu tolloot ci juróom ñaari kilomeetar ci diganteem ak province bu Chinois bu Fujian."" This translates to ""...Morakot is located 9 kilometers from the coast of the Chinese province of Fujian.""

The question asks for the distance between the coast and the typhoon (Fuji).  Since Morakot *is* the typhoon (referred to as ""Typhon"" in the question), the distance is 9 kilometers. The 11km/h is the speed of the typhoon, not a distance.



"
Kan mo niyu woon George W. Bush bimu dalaloon ci réewum Asie?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ak Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that George W. Bush met with and had a lengthy discussion with Lee Hsien Loong, and also mentions meeting with other officials including Wong Kan Seng.  The question asks *who* Bush met with in Asia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Njiitu Jariñ bu mag bi:** This is too vague – it just says ""the prime minister,"" but doesn't give specific names.
* **B: Ab mboloo:** This means ""none,"" which is incorrect as the passage clearly states he met people.
* **D: Ki topp ci njiitu jariñ bu mag bi:**  This means ""with the prime minister,"" again too vague and doesn't specify *which* prime minister beyond the general term.



"
Kañ la njiitu réew mi wax ci wasaaré jënd ak jaay bu Asie?,"The correct answer is **D: Ci tourné wam buy def benn ayu-bis ci Asie**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Teewalkat Jëwriñu bu jiitu bu Singapoor mo ko doon nuyu ak waxtaan ci njënd ak njaay ak jafe jafe ci mboolo yuuy ye fitna ak Lee Hsien Loong Njiitu Jëwriñ ci Singapoor...Bush wax ay nit lu jëm ci yokkute jënd ak jaay ci Asi."" This translates to: ""The Singaporean journalist wanted to discuss and understand the issues and challenges during the meeting with Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore...Bush spoke to many people about the future and challenges in Asia.""  This clearly indicates his visit was part of a broader Asian tour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bimu aksee ci Singapore:** While he *was* in Singapore, the passage indicates it was part of a larger trip.
* **B: Ak Wong Kan Seng:** The passage doesn't mention Wong Kan Seng. It specifically mentions Lee Hsien Loong.
* **C: Bimu ñakkee ci palum xaaju mandat wam:**  This isn't supported by the information in the passage.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët, ban ci yile mooy jubluwaayu mbooleem nguur gi?","The correct answer is **C: Am yeneen 1 300 sareet**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeneen 300 dina indi lépp ci 1300 wagon yuñu wara am ngir indi ay saafara ci askan wi nimuy yokkee."" (300 days it took to fill 1300 wagons which were used to transport the materials needed for the journey).
* **The question asks:** How many trips were made in total?
* The 1300 wagons represent the total number of trips made to gather the necessary materials.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Financé ay sareet yu bari fi ak Mars ci at mii:** This refers to financing and is not about the number of trips.
* **B: Am lu toll ci 300 sareet:** This only mentions the 300 days, not the total number of trips.
* **D: Waññi feesaayu sareet yi:** This is too vague and doesn't give a specific number.



"
Lan la nguur gi xamle?,"The correct answer is **C: Dañuy waajal financé yeneen 1 300 sareet**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yeneen 300 dina indi lépp ci 1300 wagon yuñu wara am ngir indi ay saafara ci askan wi nimuy yokkee.""  This translates to ""300 days passed and 1300 wagons were ready to transport goods on the newly built road.""  The context is about a financing project completing the infrastructure to allow transport of goods.
* **Option C** accurately reflects this: ""Dañuy waajal financé yeneen 1 300 sareet"" translates to ""A financed project of 1300 wagons.""  It directly links to the completed number of wagons ready for transport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañuy waajal financé 300 sareet:**  300 refers to *days*, not the project scale.
* **B: Doggu nañu ngir wàññi jafe-jafey feesaayu sareet yi:** This means ""They are preparing to clean the goods wagons"", which isn't the main point of the passage.
* **D: Di nañu indi ay saafara ci jafe-jafe feesaay bi ci weer Màrs:** This means ""They are transporting goods in the month of March"", while true, isn't the central information about the project's completion.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, yan xibaar lañu xam?","The correct answer is **B: Amatul benn fitna**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** translates to something like: ""What I know is this: 'Amul, a certain person, is looking for someone to do something for them.  Maybe the person who understands this message will find a way to help them.'""
* **Q (the question)** asks: ""What is being sought in this message, what does the person want?""
* The passage directly states someone (""Amul"") is looking for someone to do something - essentially, they are seeking help or a service.  ""Amatul benn fitna"" (Amul is looking for help/a need) is the closest and most direct answer to what's being sought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañoo waññi dayoob fitna bi:** ""They don't want to reveal the need."" - This is the *opposite* of what the message is doing; it *is* revealing a need.
* **C: Ñoo ngi xaarandi ab cong:** ""You will understand this matter."" - This refers to understanding the message itself, not *what* the message is about.
* **D: Service de renseignement yi weral nañu ni cong bi dina metti:** ""Intelligence services are aware of this matter."" -  This is an assumption and not stated in the passage.



"
Ban ci yile wax yu àju ci ñaxtu gi mo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **A: Commision wu njiitu réew mi ab tontu la woon ci ñaxtu yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Komisiyoŋ bi mu ngi woon ca tontug Martelly ngir wasaare ñàxtu yu àndul ak nguur gi yu tambaliwoon ci Oktoobar.""  This translates to ""The commission was tasked by Martelly to organize the elections and the results that followed in October."" This directly links the commission to handling the elections and therefore, the results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Palum njiit yu yeex yi ñoo waraloon ñaxtu yi** - The passage doesn't mention the candidates contesting the results.
* **C: Wey-fippu yi ñoo ngi doon sàkku CEP bu yagg bi tekki ndombol tankam** - The passage doesn't mention observers wanting to dismiss the CEP.
* **D: Wey-fippu yi dañu daan nekk ñu voilent yenn saay** - The passage doesn't mention violence.



"
Kan moo digle woon CEP bu yagg bi tekki ndombol takkam?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Martelly waat na ci Palum Konsey nëgandiku (Provisional Electoral Council CEP) bu bees bu juróom ñenti way-bokk demb."" This translates to ""Martelly appointed members to the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) who were not jurists.""  The passage then discusses issues with the CEP appointed *by* Martelly. Therefore, Martelly is the one who initially appointed the problematic members.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wey-fippu yi** (The oppositions) - The text doesn't state the opposition appointed anyone.
*   **C: Commission wu njiitu réew mi** (The national electoral commission) - This is a general term for the CEP, not the specific actor who made the initial appointments.
*   **D: Ñi bokk ci CEP yi ñoo ko digël seen bopp** (Those within the CEP who were displeased with their peers) - The text focuses on the appointment process, not internal conflicts within the CEP.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci wax jii, lan la Gymnastic bu USA jiitewul bi Nassar teggee athlètes yi jëf yu ñaaw?","The correct answer is **C: Coppite yu am solo ci biir mbootaay bi** (Solo compensation funds).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...tax dina ñu indi bépp coppite gu war ngir loolu baña amati."" This translates to ""...they established a special compensation fund for this to happen.""  This directly refers to establishing funds to compensate the athletes harmed by Larry Nassar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Décertification:** While there were consequences for USA Gymnastics, the passage focuses on *compensation*, not decertification.
*   **B: Sos ab diiwaan buñu dooleel:** (Some kind of special assistance) - The passage mentions help, but it’s specifically about a fund for compensation.
*   **D: Ab gëstu gu moom boppam:** (Some kind of management change) - While changes likely happened within the organizations, the passage highlights the financial response (the fund).



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci wax ji, lan mooy jubluwaay bu ëpp solo ci USA Gymnastic ak United States Olympic Committee yuy jëm kanam?","The correct answer is **A: Leeral ci saaga yu Larry Nassa** (Issues with the Larry Nassar saga).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that USA Gymnastics and the USOC are facing issues *because* of the abuse cases connected to Larry Nassar (""fit gi ñi jota mucc ci Larry Nassar""). The entire problem stems from the handling of those cases, the cover-ups, and the resulting damage to athletes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Weyal décertification** (Decertification issues) - While decertification *could* be a consequence, the passage doesn't directly state it's the core issue.
* **C: Weyal ab lanket bu piriwé** (Issues with privacy) -  Privacy is a concern, but not the central problem discussed.
* **D: Dooleel ab barab bu wóor ngir athlètes yi** (Issues with support for athletes) -  Lack of support is *a result* of the mismanagement, but not the initial cause of the problems.



"
Fan la bato bi nekkoon di dem bi mbir mi amee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""gaal gi dafa doon dem Puerto Princesa ci Palawan."" This translates to ""the boat departed from Puerto Princesa in Palawan.""  Therefore, the boat departed from Palawan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Etats-unis (United States):** While the boat is American, it didn't *depart* from the US.
*   **B: Porto Rico (Puerto Rico):** The text mentions Puerto Princesa, which is in Palawan, not Puerto Rico.
*   **D: Japon (Japan):** The US fleet is *stationed* in Japan (Sasebo, Nagasaki), but the boat departed from Palawan.



"
Ban ci yile jëf yu àju ci bato buñu lim ci xët bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Palawan la nekk**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""gaal gi dafa doon dem Puerto Princesa ci Palawan."" (The ship departed from Puerto Princesa in Palawan.)  The question asks *where* the ship is located. Palawan is the location mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moo ngi woon ci yoonam jëm Puerto Princesa:** While the ship *was* in Puerto Princesa, the question asks for its current location based on the text – the text doesn’t state that is *still* there.
* **C: Ab bato la buñuy jëfandikoo ngir xeex miin yi:** This translates to ""The ships are equipped to deal with mine threats,"" which is a capability, not a location.
* **D: Juróom ñaareelu flotte bu marine américaine lañ ko jagleel:** This translates to ""The seventh fleet of the American Navy oversees it,"" which refers to oversight, not the ship's physical location.



"
Kan moo wax dekalaare bu àju ci troupes américaines yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lu yeex ci Gaaawu, njiitu réewu Amerig **Donald Trump**, ci ab wax bu mu wax jaaree ko ci sekereteeru tasskatu xibaar bi, yëgle na takk deru waa Amerig yi dinanu genn Syrie...""  This translates to: ""Yesterday, the President of the United States, **Donald Trump**, issued an order to his defense secretary, announcing the withdrawal of American troops from Syria...""

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one making the declaration about the American troops.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci wax jii, ban réew moo nango yore xeexkat yuñu japp?","The correct answer is **D: Turquie**.

Here's why:

The text states that Turkey is holding onto ISIS soldiers, and the conversation between Trump and Erdogan was about this issue. The question asks which country is being discussed in relation to holding these soldiers. Therefore, the answer is Turquie (Turkey).

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Syrie:** While the text mentions Syria, it's the *location* where the soldiers were found, not the country holding them.
*   **B: Orop (Europe):** Europe is mentioned as being concerned, but not as the country holding the soldiers.
*   **C: Etats-Unis (United States):** The US is involved through Trump, but isn't the country holding the ISIS soldiers.



"
Lan lañu jàpp ni mo waral roplaan bi daanu?,"The correct answer is **A: Suuf su bon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...té geem nagnu ni mongi bayyéko ci ak safara."" This translates to ""...and they went with the desert.""  The question asks what they went *with* the plan.  ""Suuf su bon"" means ""the good desert,"" directly relating to the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lakk yu tar** - ""Dark clouds"" - Not mentioned in the context of going *with* the plan.
* **C: Barab yu bari ay montaañ** - ""Big mountains"" - Also not directly related to accompanying the plan.
* **D: Jawwu ju bon** - ""Good weather"" - While potentially related to travel, it's not what the passage specifically states they went *with*.



"
Ci ban xeetu barab la roplaan bi daanoo?,"The correct answer is **C: Coalition**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kowalisiyon ak Turupi Afganistaan..."" (The coalition with Turkey in Afghanistan...) This directly indicates that the ""barab"" (group/force) being discussed is a coalition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hostile:** While the coalition might *face* hostility, it *is not* a hostile force itself according to the text.
* **B: Dëgër (Difficult/Hard):** The passage mentions difficulty (""suuf su dêgër""), but that describes the *situation* not the group itself.
* **D: Bari montaañ (High mountains):** The passage mentions mountains (""asmaan su neexul"") as part of the environment, but not as the group itself.



"
Lan la njiit yi yaakaar bi mbënd mi amee?,"The correct answer is **A: Defaraat baŋu suuf yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""njiit yi yaakaar nanu ne dina doy ngir deloosi bangu suuf yu yàkku yu nekk ci fi ndox mi d wàccee.""  This translates to ""the individuals considered that it was for delivering precious goods and livestock.""

Therefore, the individuals considered the purpose of the event to be delivering precious goods (bangu suuf).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sos ay tefes:** The passage mentions *tefes* but not as the *purpose* identified by the individuals.
*   **C: Limu chevesnes à bosse yu bari:** This option doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
*   **D: Yeneeni dëkkuwaayi njanaaw yi:** While the passage mentions *dëkkuwaayi* (difficulties), it's not what the individuals *thought* the event was *for*.



"
Yan ci yile la tabaxum baraas bi laal ci anam guy sax?,"The correct answer is **C: Dëkkuwaayu njanaaw yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) talks about the difficulties faced by those who participated in the 1963 protest.** It mentions the hardships (""bangu suuf ak ak tefes"") and the lasting emotional scars (""dëkuway mala yi"").  It also discusses the repression they faced.
* **""Dëkkuwaayu njanaaw yi"" translates to ""the scars of yesterday""**. This directly relates to the lasting emotional and societal wounds caused by the events described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baaru suuf yi (""the good things"")** - The passage focuses on the *difficulties* and *consequences*, not positive outcomes.
* **B: Chevesnes à bosse (""Chevesnes the boss"")** - This is irrelevant and doesn't appear in the context.
* **D: Wasaare sediment yi (""sediment layers"")** - While metaphorical, it's not the *direct* consequence being discussed; the passage focuses on the *human* impact.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mo jox Etats-Unis ay xibaar ci ay cong yu bari?","The correct answer is **A: Extrémistes yu Somali**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the US ambassador in Nairobi warned about ""attacks by Somali extremists"" and mentions their potential targeting of monuments in Kenya and Ethiopia.  The passage links the threat directly to Somali extremists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ambasaatu Ecopi:** The ambassador is from the US, not Ethiopia.
* **C: Ab ccostéef buñu nëbb:** This doesn't relate to the content of the text.
* **D: Ab costéef ci Kenya:** While Kenya is mentioned as a potential target, the source of the threat isn't Kenyan extremists.



"
Ban ci yile wax mooy xamle bu baax congum extrémistes yuñu njort?,"The correct answer is **C: Kalaatel ay bomb ca ay barab yuñu tànn ci ñaari réew** (They bombed places that were attacked in foreign countries).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The US ambassador mentioned ""attacks by extremist Somalis"" and that the US received information about planned ""kamikaze"" attacks targeting ""monuments"" in Ethiopia and Kenya.
* **This clearly indicates:** Attacks were planned *in* Ethiopia and Kenya (foreign countries), targeting specific locations (places).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kalaatel ay bomb ci ay barab yuñu tànn ci ab réew** (They bombed places that were attacked in their own country) - The attacks were planned *in other countries*, not their own.
* **B: Kalaatel ay bomb ci ñaari réew** (They bombed foreign countries) - This is too broad. The passage specifically mentions attacks *on* locations *in* those countries.
* **D: Kalaatel ay bomb ci benn réew** (They bombed one country) - The passage mentions two countries: Ethiopia and Kenya.



"
Ban ci yile nit ñoo nekkul ab awokaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Petros Mantouvalos danu ko wàcce ndax ku bokk ci buroom dafa dug ci jot xaalis gu lewul ak ger."" This translates to ""Petros Mantouvalos is being pursued because he is involved in a serious and ongoing case.""  This indicates he is the one being investigated/pursued (awokaa).

The other options are mentioned as people *involved* in the case, but not as the one being actively pursued.



"
Ban gurubu nit lañu limul niki lu bokk ci eskandal bi ci biir askanu yoonu Gerek?,"The correct answer is **B: Atekat yi** (The criminals).

Here's why:

The passage discusses a scandal involving Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos who were arrested in connection with a case in Athens. It then talks about other individuals involved in criminal activities like Evangelos Kalousis and Makis Triantafylopoulo. The entire text revolves around *criminal* acts and those committing them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Awokaa yi** (The lawyers) - While lawyers might be involved in such cases, the passage doesn't center around them.
*   **C: Taskati xibaar yi** (The TV reporters) - Makis Triantafylopoulo is a TV reporter, but the question asks about *those involved in the scandal itself*, not just reporting on it.
*   **D: Porokirër yi** (The prosecutors) - Similar to lawyers, prosecutors might be involved, but are not the primary focus of who is *in* the scandal.



"
Ñaata guichets la Ind ñakk?,"The correct answer is **C: 2**.

The text states: ""...2 juróom benn."" which translates to ""...2 sixes.""  The question asks how many sixes India hit. Therefore, the answer is 2."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo nekkoon poñ bi gëna mag ci manches yi?","The correct answer is **A: 70 rawante**.

The passage states: ""Robin Uthappa défna ndam bi gëna mag, **70 runs** ci 41 balls..."" (Robin Uthappa played well, **70 runs** off 41 balls...).  The question asks about how many runs he scored."
Ban ci yile moo nekkul li waral ñaxtuy Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **B: Dindi fentu Pays de Galles**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Moom [Pays de Galles] ci ndoorte la lañu tàmbali di nax."""" This translates to ""He [Pays de Galles] is in court because they accused him of theft.""  Therefore, Adam Cuerden is being accused of theft *in* Wales (Pays de Galles).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sàrtu dal bu bees àju ci këmbu awra** - While the text mentions a financial aspect, it doesn't directly state this is the core issue.
*   **C: Pays de Galles bañ leen degglu** - The text doesn't say Wales isn't allowing something. It says Cuerden is *in court* in Wales.
*   **D: Ay fen ci li waral ñu dindi fent gi** - This is too vague and doesn't directly address the core issue of *where* the problem is happening.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañu dindi ci dal bi?","The correct answer is **C: Ab porose polotik**.

Here's why:

The text discusses a situation involving Adam Cuerden, a political issue (""polotik bu mengook""), and a significant amount of money (""miliyoŋi mejaa ci daganal bu ubbeeku""). It describes a scandal (""Merug askan"") relating to this.  Therefore, the core subject matter is a political process/problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Art:** The text doesn't mention anything about art.
* **B: Këmbu awra:** While money (""awra"") is mentioned, the *focus* isn't on wealth itself, but on a scandal involving it.
* **D: Tasukaayu xibaar bu jambur moom:** This translates to ""information about this country's population,"" which isn't the primary topic.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la Amir Khan jiitewul?","The correct answer is **C: Xalaati jigeen ñi** (The fame of the wrestlers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amir Khan mi jël medaayu xaalis bi ci olimpik yu 2004 yi neena,” Gëm naa ne jigéen ñi waru ñu xeex. Mooy sama xalaat.”  This translates to ""Amir Khan won a silver medal at the 2004 Olympics, making the wrestlers very famous. It was a great fame.""

The question asks what the passage highlights about Amir Khan's win. The passage directly connects his win to increasing the fame of the wrestlers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dugal xeexkat yu jigéen yi ci Jeux Olympiques yi** (The wrestling matches at the Olympic Games) - The passage doesn't focus on the matches themselves.
* **B: Diirante kati mbagg yu Angalteer** (During the England team's competition) - This is too broad; the passage specifically focuses on Amir Khan.
* **D: Londres mi nekk di dalal Jeux Olympiques yi** (London which hosted the Olympic Games) - While London is mentioned later, it's not the central point of the first part of the text.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la Amir Khan di jiite donte daf ci am xalaatu boppam?","The correct answer is **C: Jeux Olympiques yu 2012**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Donte àddu woon na ci neena dina jàppale konkiran wu Angalteer yi ci Olympik yuñuy amal ci Londres."" This translates to ""Donte was added to the team to compete for England in the latest Olympics in London.""
* **London hosted the Olympics in 2012.**  The passage clearly refers to a recent Olympics in London.
* **The passage also mentions the 2004 Olympics**, but that's in the context of Amir Khan *already* having competed then.  The question asks about when Donte was added to a team.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xeexkat yu jigéen yi (Stories of athletes):** This is too broad. The passage focuses on a specific event.
* **B: Ay xariti kujewam ci Jeux Olympiques yu 2004 (Some information about the 2004 Olympics):** This is about a past event, not the one Donte is joining.
* **D: Yeneen medaayi xaalis (Winning medals):**  The passage doesn't focus on winning medals, only on being *on* a team.



"
Kan la Peter Lenz faatu?,"The correct answer is **B: Bi weloom daanoo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...faatu na bimu bokkee ci ab laksidaŋ ca Indianapolis Motor Speedway...Xavier Zayat mu nekkoon ci beneen welo."" This directly translates to ""He died in an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway... Xavier Zayat was with him at the time.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ci tuuru tangal bi** (On the racing track) - While the accident *happened* on the track, it doesn't state *where* he died.
*   **C: Ca lopitaal ba** (At the hospital) - The text says he was *taken* to the hospital, but not that he died there.
*   **D: Bimu nekkee ak waa kër doktoor ci piste bi** (With someone from the doctor's team on the track) - This is not mentioned in the text.



"
Kan mooy Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **A: Ab ndawal kër doktoor bu nekk ci yoon bu baax bi** (He is a doctor who is in good condition).

Here's why:

The text states ""moroomam Xavier Zayat mu nekkoon ci beneen welo"" which translates to ""driver Xavier Zayat was also injured"". It then says ""Doktoor yi jàppale woon nañ ko ci saasi ba noppi ñu toxal ko ci beneen lopitaal"" meaning ""Doctors treated him on the scene before transporting him to the hospital.""  This clearly indicates Xavier Zayat is a doctor and survived the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Beneen rawantekat** (A racer) - The text doesn't say Zayat is a racer, only that he was with Peter Lenz.
*   **C: ab doktoor** (a doctor) - While true, it's not the *complete* information. The text adds that he's in good condition.
*   **D: Ab fans** (A fan) - The text doesn't indicate he's a fan, he was involved in the accident as a driver/passenger.



"
Ci ban anam la ab dawalkatu roplaan bu mér di am interêt xam ni roplaan di doxee?,"The correct answer is **B: Sudee seen bañug roplaan mu ngi bawoo ci ragalug luñu xamul.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the importance of planning and foresight, particularly for young people.** It highlights needing to think about the consequences of actions and avoid rushing into things without understanding.  It emphasizes careful consideration (""tukki ci roplaan"") and avoiding being swept away by temporary desires (""ay xew-xew yu jaxase seen xel"").
* **The question (Q) asks about the benefit of thoughtful planning.**
* **Option B directly addresses this.**  It states that people benefit from planning because it allows them to carefully consider things before acting. ""Bañug roplaan mu ngi bawoo ci ragalug luñu xamul"" translates to ""planning allows you to think carefully before acting.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Su ab kiliyaan rusee ci tapetam** (Some people only realize their mistakes after it's too late) – This is a *consequence* of *not* planning, not a benefit of planning.
* **C: Sudee kiliyaan bi du am lu ko neex bépp xeeti dem ak dikk** (Some people do things they later regret, resulting in problems and difficulties) –  Similar to A, this describes a negative outcome.
* **D: Sudee seen tiitange dafay bawoo ci ay xew-xew yu ragalu ci vol bi** (Some experiences lead people to be swayed by fleeting desires) – This describes a vulnerability, not a benefit of planning.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that directly and accurately reflects the main point of the passage regarding the advantages of careful planning."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la ab wey-tukki buy xalaat wara mujjee def?","The correct answer is **A: Seet leen offre yu këri wey tukki yu bari.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Yenn saay benn wol bi mën naa am ay njëg yu wuute ci ay agregateur yu bari te li ci gën mooy méngale njuréefi gëstu yi te xool itam daluwebu compañi ayeriyen bi ci bopp laata ngay def sa reservation.""  This translates to ""They often have good deals on aggregator sites and it's often cheaper to book through travel companies directly on their websites.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is recommended in the text to find cheap flights?
* **Option A** (""Offer them good cheap flight deals"") directly reflects the information about finding better prices through aggregators and direct bookings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  While dealing with prices is relevant, the passage doesn't specifically mention *places* to compare prices or a ""top"" hotel.
* **C:** The passage mentions *using* travel companies, not *being* a travel company.
* **D:** While the passage mentions online travel companies, it doesn't recommend *being* an online travel company.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la wey-tukki yi wara njëkka def ngir àar njëgi tiketu tiket yi gëna yomb?","The correct answer is **A: Xoolal dalu webu compagnie aérienne bi** (Contact the airline's website directly).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yenn saay benn wol bi mën naa am ay njëg yu wuute ci ay agregateur yu bari te li ci gën mooy méngale njuréefi gëstu yi te xool itam daluwebu compañi ayeriyen bi ci bopp laata ngay def sa reservation.""  This translates to: ""Often it's better to have direct contact with the airline's website and especially to manage your reservation.""

The question asks what to do to *change* a flight. The passage explicitly recommends going directly to the airline's website for this purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mengalel njëg yi digante ay aggrégateurs yu bari** (Contacting third-party aggregators) - The passage actually suggests avoiding aggregators for managing reservations.
* **C: Jàpp leen palaas ci saasi ci këru njaayum tiketu tukki bi** (Call them directly regarding the flight ticket price) - The passage doesn't mention price; it's about *changing* a reservation.
* **D: Jàppal palaas ci saasi ab këru tukki** (Call them directly regarding the flight) - Similar to C, this is about a general call, not specifically managing a change.



"
Kañ lañuy sakku ci ab kër mu guŋgee ab livraison?,"The correct answer is **A: Suñu yonnee ay mbir ci ab fret**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Sunu yónnee ay mbir ci ngélaw li, ci yenn yoon yi mën na jël ay fan yu bari ngir jàll ci yebbi gi ak waa duwaan.""  This translates to: ""Some deliveries are made at the door, in some cases, they find big advantages to deliver to the house and with people."" This directly relates to the question about deliveries to the house.
* **""ab fret""** likely refers to the doorstep/outside the house.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Su kër gi nekkee di jëfandikoo ay roplaan:**  This translates to ""The house needs to adjust to the plans."" This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C: Suñuy yónnee ay mbir niki ay bagaas yuñu enregistré:** This translates to ""Some deliveries are made with registered packages."" While possible, the passage doesn't specifically focus on *registered* packages.
* **D: Su ab kër bu gëna mag nekkee di toppatoo livraison bi:** This translates to ""The house with a large gate needs to accept the delivery."" The passage doesn't mention gate size.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, sooy tànn ak kêru jaay tiket Frequent Flye ci ab alliance, ban ci yile lañu wara gëna jox gëdd?","The correct answer is **B: Këru njaayum tiket ci alliance bu gëna mag**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement** is about a problem with a Frequent Flyer program – points aren't being credited correctly.  It mentions the problem exists with ""roppalaan bilay yobb lu ëpp"" (partners/airlines in the alliance).
* **Q's question** asks *how* to get a Frequent Flyer ticket with the alliance, specifically asking if it's possible to earn points while traveling.
* **Option B** directly addresses this. ""Këru njaayum tiket ci alliance bu gëna mag"" translates to ""You can earn tickets in the alliance that earn points."" This answers the question of whether points can be earned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""You can earn tickets by buying expensive fares"" - Doesn't address the alliance or earning points specifically.
* **C:** ""You can earn tickets for future use"" - Doesn't address the alliance or earning points specifically.
* **D:** ""The company is trying to improve things"" - Doesn't answer the question about *how* to earn tickets.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo wara joxe ay poñi tukki yu gëna bari?","The passage (P) discusses a frequent flyer program where points are earned and can be used for travel. It mentions that points can be redeemed for flights, and that some flights are more expensive in points than others. The question (Q) asks what someone needs to do to find cheaper award flights.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Ab këru njaayum tiket bu wuute ci ab allliance bu wuute** (You need to search for cheap tickets on a specific alliance.) - This is a possibility, but doesn't fully capture the nuance of finding *award* flights.
* **B: Sa këru njaayum tiket bi ngay gëna dem ci kaadaru mennum alliance bi** (You need to search for flights that go through a certain number of alliances.) - This doesn't make logical sense in the context of finding cheaper award flights.
* **C: Sa këru njaayum tiket bi ngay gëna dem ci alliance bu wuute** (You need to search for flights that go through a specific alliance.) - This is the **most likely answer.**  Different alliances have different award charts and availability.  Flexibility with which alliance you fly can lead to cheaper award redemptions.
* **D: Ab këru tukki bu wuute ci benn alliance bi** (You need to search for cheap tickets on another alliance.) - Similar to A, but less specific.

Considering the context of frequent flyer programs and award travel, **C** is the best answer.  Finding award flights often involves being flexible with your airline choices (and therefore, the alliance they belong to).

Therefore, the answer is **C**.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci yëg-yëg wuute yi, ban ci yile lañu mëna dankaafu ci ab jëfandikoo sangara bu ëpp?","The correct answer is **A: Dégg**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation of apples being sold in the market.** It talks about their quality, price, and how they are displayed.
* **""Dégg"" means ""market"" in Wolof.** This directly relates to the context of the passage.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Gis-gis:** Means ""school"" - irrelevant to the passage.
    * **C: Cafka:** Means ""money"" - while money *is* involved in a market, it's not the *place* being discussed.
    * **D: Xet:** Means ""road"" - also irrelevant.

The question (Q) asks for the place where the described situation happens. Since the passage is about apples being sold, the answer is the market (""dégg"").



"
"Niñ ko waxee ci xët bi, lan moo wara mëna wàññi mbir yiy gaañe ci sangara?","The correct answer is **A: Jëfandikoo sangara bu am methanol**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes dangerous counterfeit palm wine (sangara).** It mentions people getting sick and even dying after drinking it.
* **The passage specifically points to the addition of something harmful to the sangara.**  It states ""...daŋkaafu bi dafay gêna yokk sooy jëfandikoo sangara buñu defar ci lu tegguwul ci yoon."" (The substance they add to make the counterfeit sangara is often mixed with a dangerous substance in the liquid).
* **Methanol is a common and extremely dangerous substance used in counterfeit alcohol.**  It causes blindness and death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Naan ay sangara yuñu defareewul ci anam bu yoon nanguwul:** This just says some sangara is made in unsanitary conditions – while bad, it doesn’t explain the *poisoning* described.
* **C: Jëfandikoo sangara ci anam gu andak dal:** This means counterfeit sangara is made in remote areas, which doesn't explain the illnesses.
* **D: Naan ak ay nit yu bari:** This means there are many people involved, but doesn’t explain *what* is making people sick.



Therefore, the passage strongly suggests the problem is the *presence of methanol* in the counterfeit sangara, making **A** the only logical answer."
Fan la njëgi dëkkuwaay yi gëna seer ci Amsterdan?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal District**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly describes the ""Goxu kanaal yi (ci lakku Olàndé: Grachtengordel)"" as being in Amsterdam.**  The passage then explains it's a significant area. ""Grachtengordel"" translates to ""Canal District"" in English.
* The passage highlights its historical and cultural importance, making it a famous area of Amsterdam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci bépp barab buñu tànn niki ab Barab bu UNESCO def moomeelam** - While true it's a UNESCO site, this is a *description* of it, not the *name* of the area.
* **C: Barab yuñu génnee ci Binnenstad** - This is too general.  It says the area is *in* Binnenstad, but doesn't name the specific district.
* **D: Barab yu am njëgi dembam** - This doesn't connect to the information in the passage.



"
Lu tax ñu tànn Canal District niki ab Barabu Ndonol UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **C: Barabam bu wër Binnenstad**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Goxu kanaal yi (ci lakku Olàndé: Grachtengordel) moo gox bu siiw bi ci jamonoy XVIIe siyeekal bi wër Binnenstad bu Amsterdam."" This translates to ""The canal district (in Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a series of canals from the 17th century in the heart of Amsterdam's Binnenstad.""
* **The question asks:** Why was the Canal District added to the UNESCO World Heritage list?
* **Option C** directly refers to the Binnenstad (the heart of Amsterdam) mentioned in the passage as the location of the canals, aligning with the reason for its UNESCO recognition as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Solos dembam ak cosaanam (beautiful landscapes and structures):** While true, the passage doesn't *specifically* state this as the reason for UNESCO recognition.
* **B: Ay moomeelam yu benne (important monuments):** Again, true, but not the specific focus of the passage's explanation.
* **D: Moomeelam bu am solo (monuments with a soul):** This is too poetic and not based on the information in the text.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci yile wax, ban moo ci tax Phnom Krom nekk lu jara dem wisit?","The correct answer is **A: Gisiin ci Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jawwu ji ñuul na ci bërëb jamukaay bi ak gissin ci déex Tonle Sap tax na yegg cikaw montañ jar ko.""  This translates to ""It is known for its beautiful scenery and especially for seeing the sunset over Tonle Sap lake.""  The question asks *why* people visit Phnom Krom, and the text directly links it to seeing the sunset on Tonle Sap.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tukki ci biir Angkor Pass:** While the text mentions the Angkor Pass, it's related to visiting Angkor generally, not *specifically* Phnom Krom.
*   **C: Gis Siem Reap:** Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but the text doesn't say people visit it *to* see Siem Reap.
*   **D: Tukkib bato ci jaare ko ci déeg bi:** This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañu soxla ci visiteur yi ngir ñu mën dem Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Am Angkor Pass**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fàww nga am cole d'Angkor ngir mëna dugg ci barabu jaamukaay bi, kon bu leen fàtte yor seen passeport su ngeen bëggee dem Tonlé Sap.""  This translates to: ""You need to have an Angkor Pass to be able to enter the temple area, and those who don't have a passport can't go to Tonle Sap.""

While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap (B) and has a temple (A, D), the *requirement* for visiting, according to the text, is the Angkor Pass.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy mëna tere ab touriste mu dem Antarctique?","The correct answer is **C: Ab waxtu liggéey bu tax nga mën tukki ci Desambar ak Samwiyee** (The best time to go is between November and February).

Here's why:

The text states: ""été rek la mëna am dalee ko novembre ba février"" which translates to ""you can only go during the summer, from November to February."" This directly addresses the best time for tourists to visit Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ab budget tukki bu am solo** (A solo budget is important) - The text doesn't mention budget specifically.
*   **B: Benn interé wu dem ci Ross Sea** (Interest in going to the Ross Sea) - While the Ross Sea is mentioned, it's a location, not a reason *to* go.
*   **D: Mëna dem ak dikk bu yem** (You need to go with a guided tour) - The text implies guided tours are common (""ay alpinism wala agg ci Pole bi, bi am baaz bu mag""), but doesn't state it's *required*.



"
Ab touriste bu bëgg yégg ci ay montaañ fan la wara dem ci Antarctique?,"The correct answer is **C: Péninsule bi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Touriste yiy ñëw siyaar doon na lu seer, te bari coono, laaj nga wér, te été rek la mëna am dalee ko novembre ba février te du faral di yam ci ile bi ak ci géeju Ross."" This translates to: ""Tourists who now travel often come to see, and many go there, especially during the summer, from November to February, and travel by ship to the island and to the Ross Sea.""

However, the text *also* states: ""Ay ñu toll ci limu junni liggéeykat ñoo fiy dund ci jamono tàngaay ci ñent ci fukki bërëb ak ñaar lu ëpp ci diwaan yooyu; tuuti ñooy des ba jamonoy seddaay."" This translates to: ""They often talk about the beautiful landscapes they found in the tangential regions of the continent and closer to the outer islands; usually these are the ten most visited areas."" This implies there are regions *besides* the Ross Sea that are popular, specifically those with mountains for climbing.

Later, the text describes people going ""ngir defi ay alpinism wala agg ci Pole bi, bi am baaz bu mag."" meaning they go ""for mountaineering or climbing to the Pole, with a large base"". This base would be located on the Antarctic **Peninsula**, a region known for its mountains and accessibility.

Therefore, the **Péninsule bi (Antarctic Peninsula)** is the most logical answer as it is a region conducive to mountaineering and climbing for tourists.



"
Fan la ab saytu bu bokkagul ci yu bees yi moo nekkul lu yomb xam fimu nekk?,"The correct answer is **D: Ci ab Campus université**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...daño faral di nekk si dëk yi walla si campus yi, moo gena yomb jot kë tabax yuy am legi.""  This translates to ""...damage occurs in schools or on campuses, it often leads to a lot of wasted time.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** Where is the problem most often found among the schools mentioned?
* **Option D (Campus université - University campus) directly relates to the passage's mention of ""campus yi"" (campuses).**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci ab barab bu yomba dem (In schools that are far away)** - The passage doesn't mention distance.
* **B: Ci ab diggu dêkk (In damaged schools)** - While damage is mentioned, the question is *where* it happens, not *that* it happens.
* **C: Ci ab barab bu sori (In quiet schools)** - The passage doesn't discuss the noise level of the schools.



"
Fan lañu wara heberger ab telescope gëstu bu bees?,"The correct answer is **A: Ci ab musée**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""Polution bu ndaw ci jamono bu nex bi du xeetu galankor bimu am tey, daño faral di nekk si dëk yi walla si campus yi, moo gena yomb jot kë tabax yuy am legi. Lu eeppee ci saytu telescopes yu béés yi ay mbiir yu reey té nééxa toxal ci beereeb lagnu ak ay mbiiru aalam yu ci wééru.""

This translates to: ""Pollution is now a major issue in developed countries, and it's often found in cities or university campuses, making it difficult for people to sleep at night.  People often go to large telescope sites in remote areas to escape the light and noise of cities.""  The passage implies telescopes are found in places *away* from cities and campuses, specifically mentioning ""remote areas,"" which aligns with museums or observatories built for that purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci ab campus université (On a university campus):** The passage specifically states pollution makes campuses *difficult* for telescope viewing.
* **C: Ci ab barabu jangukaay (In a busy neighborhood):**  Busy neighborhoods are the opposite of the remote locations needed for clear telescope viewing.
* **D: Ci ab barabu liggéeykaay bu mag (In a large shopping center):** Shopping centers have a lot of light pollution and noise.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban barab moo wara doon fi gën ngir dem ci tefes bi?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tefesi Tamaki Drive ñoo ngi nekk ci Waitemata Harbour, ci ci goxi Mission Bay ak **St Heliers** yu seer yi ca Diggu Auckland."" (Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, near Mission Bay and **St Heliers** which are beautiful in Auckland.)

The question asks for places *near* the beaches mentioned. St Heliers is explicitly stated as being near the beaches on Tamaki Drive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mission Bay** - Also near, but St Heliers is the direct answer to the question of a place *near* the beaches.
*   **C: The North Harbor District** - This is a larger geographical area where the beaches are located, but not specifically *near* them in the same way as St Heliers or Mission Bay.
*   **D: Waitemata Harbor** - This is the body of water the beaches are *in*, not a place near them.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan moo gëna woor ngir dem sangu fa?","The correct answer is **D: Long Bay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ñoom ñoo dem ba ci Long Bay ci bëj gànnaaru ba Devonport ci bëj saalum."" This translates to ""They go to Long Bay in the evening and Devonport in the morning.""  The question asks where people go to watch the sunset (""dem sangu fa""). Since Long Bay is mentioned as a destination *in the evening*, it's the logical place for sunset viewing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Devonport:** Mentioned as a morning destination.
*   **B: North Harbor District:** This is a general area, not a specific sunset viewing spot.
*   **C: Central Auckland:**  While Mission Bay and St Heliers are *in* Auckland, the passage specifically highlights Long Bay and Devonport as the places people visit.



"
"Sooy dem ci barab buñu xamle ci xët bi, ban ci mbir yii ñoo andul ak loolu?","The correct answer is **B: Bayyi ab mandarga fenn ci barab bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) is discussing vandalism and disrespect towards memorials/sacred places.** It talks about defacing them with graffiti, and compares it to the Holocaust and Nazis – highlighting the extreme disrespect shown.
* **The question (Q) asks what people *do* in these acts of disrespect.**
* **Option B (""Bayyi ab mandarga fenn ci barab bi"" - They intentionally damage things in the area) directly relates to the act of vandalism and defacement described in the passage.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jëfee ci anam bu jekk (Looking at a single thing):** This is too vague and doesn't address the active disrespect described.
* **C: Wax / def ay mbir yu reelu (To steal/destroy real objects):** While destruction *could* be involved, the passage specifically mentions graffiti which is more about defacement than total destruction.
* **D: Xoos ab banqaas (To just go and sit):** This is the opposite of the disrespectful action being discussed.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and relevant answer to the question based on the information provided in the passage."
Ban ci yile mooy xamle luy lakku lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **A: Luñu sos**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Làkk yuñ ci dolli are làkk yu artifisiyel lañu yuñu sos ci ndorteel bi ngir yombal waxtaan...""  This translates to ""These languages, including artificial languages, are languages *created* for the purpose of facilitating communication...""
* **""Luñu sos""** means ""created languages"" or ""artificial languages"".  This directly aligns with the passage's description of *lingua francas* often being artificial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lu natirelul** - Means ""natural languages."" The passage contrasts artificial languages *with* natural languages.
* **C: Luñu tabax** - Means ""simple languages."" While some lingua francas *might* be simple, this isn't the defining characteristic mentioned in the text.
* **D: Luy dundu** - Means ""old languages.""  This doesn't relate to the passage's explanation of lingua francas.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) discusses the limitations of artificial languages.** It states they lack the natural evolution and organic growth of human languages, and often struggle to convey nuanced meaning.  It mentions the difficulty in fully understanding them, even for those who study them.
* **Q (the question) asks about the challenges people face when learning artificial languages.**
* **Option A** directly addresses this. It states that artificial languages are difficult to learn *because* they lack the natural development that helps humans understand and use language. It connects directly to the passage's core argument.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  While true that artificial languages *are* often not natural, it doesn't explain *why* they're hard to learn.
* **C:** This simply restates a feature of artificial languages (they're designed for communication) without addressing the learning difficulty.
* **D:**  This is vague and doesn't address the specific problem of understanding the nuances of artificial languages.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la kiliyaan wara xool sudee seen croisière ci été bi laè koy amal?","The correct answer is **B: Càkkutéefi visa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses needing a visa.** The text states ""Ñiy def ay kuriwasiyeer laaju ñu leen ñu joxe wisa (xool leen sàrt yi)."" This translates to ""Many tourists need a visa (their entry papers).""
* **The question asks about requirements for a cruise.** A cruise, especially one starting in Saint-Petersbourg, would likely require a visa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Barab bi cabin bi nekk:**  The passage mentions cabins, but the problem isn't *about* the cabin itself, it's about what you need *to get on* the cruise.
* **C: Diir yi:**  ""Diir yi"" refers to the doors (of the shop) – irrelevant to cruise requirements.
* **D: Dayoob waxtu yuñuy def ci dëkk bi:** This refers to when tourists arrive at the shop, not the requirements for the cruise itself.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, su ab kiliyaan defee ab croisière ci été bi, lan lañu wara mëna moytu?","The correct answer is **A: Diir buñuy nekk ci dëkk bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ñiy def ay kuriwasiyeer laaju ñu leen ñu joxe wisa (xool leen sàrt yi)."" This translates to ""Many tourists go there to get visas (they need them).""
* **The question asks:** What is needed in the text, if someone wants to take a cruise in the summer?
* **Diir buñuy nekk ci dëkk bi** translates to ""Visa is needed in the shop/office"", which directly relates to needing a visa for travel as mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dem ci galaas gi** (Asking about the glass) - irrelevant to the question.
* **C: Càkkutéefu Visa** (Visa application) - The passage doesn't discuss the *application* process, only the *need* for a visa.
* **D: Saint Petersburg** - While Saint Petersburg is mentioned, it's where the visas are obtained *from*, not the thing needed for the cruise itself.



"
Lu tax ñuy jëfandikoo lakku Catalan lu bari ngir ay mandarga ak ay yëgle ci Barcelone?,"The correct answer is **A: Moom lañu gëna nand kë Español**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage:** The passage states that while many in Barcelona *understand* Catalan, they often *respond* in Spanish (""te ku nekk ci yoon degg na español"").  It emphasizes Spanish is widely used and understood, making it the more common language for communication with outsiders.
* **Why other options are wrong:**
    * **B: Mooy lakk bi gëna officielle ci dëkk bi** - While Catalan *is* an official language, the passage highlights that Spanish is more readily used in interactions.
    * **C: Mooy lakk buñu taamu ci Barcelone** - The passage doesn't say Catalan isn't spoken, just that Spanish is often preferred for wider communication.
    * **D: Métro bi ak yeneeni jumtukaay yuñu jagleel askan wi ñooy yu ñi fa dëkk tey lakk Catalan di gën dem** - This option is about signage and doesn't address the language people use when *speaking* to visitors.



Therefore, the passage indicates that if you want to be understood in Barcelona, using Spanish is a good bet, as many will respond in that language even if they understand Catalan."
Ban ci lakk yii lañuy sistemu Barcelone di gëna jëfandikoo ngir ay yëgle yu bari?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Kàllama gu nu ndangu bu Barsaln mooy Katalan ak Esapañol.**"" which translates to ""The languages spoken in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.""  It further emphasizes Catalan as being strongly tied to the region (""**mooy làkku liggéey ci réew mi**"" - it's the language of the country/region). The question asks about the language system *of* Barcelona used for official communication. While Spanish is also spoken, Catalan is presented as the more intrinsic and local language.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile jumtukaay la ab néegu bu ñuy joxe ndekki lañu warul jox gëdd?","The correct answer is **B: Ay meuble yu yagg te benne** (Beautiful and comfortable furniture).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes B&Bs offering ""wallu lal ak ndekki"" (comfort and rest).** It then goes on to detail comfortable beds (""fekkay bu rafet lu melni""), good food (""saaku lal bu nu defaree loxo wala benn lal bu yàgg""), and a welcoming atmosphere.  This strongly points towards the quality of the furnishings being a key selling point.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ay yëfi njëlu spécialité (Any special dishes):** While the passage mentions good food, it's not the *primary* focus of what makes the B&Bs appealing.
    * **C: Ay barabi biti yuñu toppatoo bu baax (Any well-decorated rooms):** ""Decoration"" is too specific. The passage talks about *comfort* and *restfulness* more broadly, which encompasses furniture.
    * **D: WiFi bu gaaw (Good WiFi):**  WiFi isn't mentioned *at all* in the passage.

* **The question (Q) asks what makes these B&Bs stand out and attract customers who are looking for rest and relaxation.** Comfortable furniture directly addresses that need.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and relevant answer based on the provided text."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile moo nekkul benn ci poñi dirrante mbag ci digante BB de luxe yi?","The correct answer is **B: Ay lim ndekki yuñuy joxe ay jamono**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) specifically mentions ""ndekki li mën na ànd ak togg yiy xew ci jamono ji ci gox bi wala mu nekk togg bu ñu jagleel gan ñi.""** This translates to something like ""The rooms are equipped with modern furniture, whether they are in a luxurious style or a more simple, traditional style.""  This directly relates to rooms having different furnishings and styles to cater to different tastes (jamono).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dekorasioŋ bu yàgg (Luxurious decoration):** While the passage mentions luxury (""rafetal""), it doesn't state *all* the B&Bs have luxurious decoration. It says there's variety.
* **C: Ay lal yu am maana (Rooms with meaning):** This is too abstract and not supported by the text.
* **D: Lekk ak naan yuñu togg ci barab bi (Smoothness and comfort in the room):** While comfort is implied, the passage focuses on the *variety* of furnishings, not just general comfort.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la Pékin dul toppatoo ci atum 2022?","The correct answer is **A: Ceremonie ubbite yi** (The opening ceremonies).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Goxu Beijing ca Siin moy dalal Powum Olympique Córón ci atum 2022, mooy tax mu doon gox bu njëk ci dalal powu Olympique nawet ak córón."" which translates to ""Beijing in China hosted the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, it was the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympic Games.""  This directly refers to the opening ceremonies as the start of the games.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ay xew-xewi barabu Taizicheng ski** (The ski competitions at Taizicheng): While the text *mentions* ski competitions at Taizicheng, it's not the main point about what Beijing hosted.
*   **C: Ay ceremonies de clôture** (The closing ceremonies): The text doesn't specifically focus on the closing ceremonies.
*   **D: Ay xew-xew ci galaas ci biir** (Competitions on ice in the hall):  While ice sports were held, this isn't the overarching thing Beijing hosted.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la Pékin di jiite ci atum 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Jeux Olympiques yu hiver** (Winter Olympic Games).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Goxu Beijing ca Siin moy dalal Powum Olympique Córón ci atum 2022..."" (Beijing hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 2022...) and mentions ""dalal itam jongaante indoor ice"" (also indoor ice competitions).  This clearly indicates a *winter* games focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jeux olympiques yu été** (Summer Olympic Games) - The text focuses on ice and snow sports, not typical summer games.
* **B: Xew-xewi galaas yuy am ci biir barab yi** (New glass roofs on the bars) - This is a detail *within* the games, not the games themselves.
* **D: Cérémonies de clôture yi** (Closing ceremonies) - This is a part of the games, but not what the games *are*.



"
Kan moo gëna yomba am feebaru grippe aviaire?,"The correct answer is **A: Ñiy yar njanaaw yi** (They affect birds).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) clearly states:** ""Girip awiyeer, wala ñu gën ko xamee ci avian influenza (girip awiyeer), mën naa wàll picc yi ak mamifeer yi."" This translates to ""Bird flu, or what is known as avian influenza (bird flu), affects birds and not mammals.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""Kan moo gëna yomba am feebaru grippe aviaire?"" which means ""Who is affected by bird flu?"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nit yuy liggéey ak mammifères yi** (People and mammals) - The passage explicitly states it *doesn't* affect mammals.
* **C: Ñiy liggéey ci njanaw yi** (They affect animals) - While technically true (birds *are* animals), the passage specifically focuses on *birds*.
* **D: Nit yuñu wàlloon bu yàgg** (People who are very worried) - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax mooy xamle bu baax luy grippe aviaire?","The correct answer is **A: Ñiy liggéey ci njanaaw yi kese ñoo am grippe bi** (They are spreading among birds that can catch the flu).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Girip awiyeer, wala ñu gën ko xamee ci avian influenza (girip awiyeer), mën naa wàll picc yi ak mamifeer yi."" This translates to ""Bird flu, or what they call avian influenza (bird flu), spreads among birds and mammals.""  The passage then mentions concern about how it impacts livestock.
* **Option A** directly reflects this spreading among birds capable of getting the flu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay kaa yu bari lañu gis ci nit ñi ak ci njanaaw yi** (They are very concerned about it affecting people and birds) - While concern *is* mentioned, the primary focus in the passage is *how* it spreads.
* **C: Ñiy toppatoo njanaaw yi ñoo ngi ci risku am feebar bi** (They are protecting birds that are at risk of getting sick) - The passage doesn't mention protective measures.
* **D: Kaa yuñu xamle ci nit ñi yépp dañuy rayaate** (They are knowledgeable about people who have already been affected) - The passage doesn't focus on already affected individuals.



"
Lan la kanaalu White Sea–Baltic Canal di boole?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic Ocean ak Baltic Sea**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""White Sea-Baltic Canal dafay lëkkale Arctic Ocean ak Baltic Sea..."" which translates to ""White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Black Sea ak Caspian Sea** - The text mentions Vikings traveling *to* these seas, not that the canal connects to them.
*   **B: Lake Onega ak River Volga** - While the canal passes near Lake Onega and the Volga River is mentioned in relation to the Caspian Sea, these aren't the *ends* of the canal.
*   **D: Southern Ocean ak Red Sea** - These bodies of water are not mentioned in the text.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban xeetu ndamaar lañu wara jëlee ay passport ngir baña teye kiliyaan yi?","The correct answer is **A: Roplaan yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Beereebu saytu gniy tukki ngay njeekkee gis bo waccé ci ropalaan, gaal, wala bénn daamar.""  This translates to ""People often need to travel by plane, train, or boat.""  The passage then connects this travel to needing passports.
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What is commonly used for people to obtain passports for traveling to other countries?""
* **Roplaan (planes)** are a common mode of transport *requiring* passports for international travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Otoraayi guddi yi (Large authorities):** While authorities *issue* passports, they aren't what people *use* to travel.
* **C: Bato yi (Boats):**  While boats are mentioned as a means of travel, the passage doesn't specifically link them to needing passports as strongly as planes.
* **D: Otoraay yuy jeggi foroñceer (Foreign exchange authorities):** This is completely unrelated to obtaining passports.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lañuy saytuwaat sa dantite ci yenn otoraay yuy jeggi foroñceer?","The correct answer is **A: So wàccee ci otoraay bi**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses difficulties traveling (""gis bo waccé ci ropalaan"") and needing passports (""paaspoor yi"") to prove identity (""dantite""). It highlights the problems people face when moving from place to place.
* **Q (the question)** asks what causes difficulties with proving identity when traveling.
* **A (So wàccee ci otoraay bi - It's difficult to travel)** directly addresses the central theme of the passage - the *difficulty of travel* is what makes proving identity challenging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B (Ci jamono bi ngay nelaw - Because of the country I come from)** - While nationality *can* sometimes be a factor, the passage doesn't specifically focus on that. It talks about the general difficulties of travel *regardless* of origin.
* **C (Duñ ko saytu - He/She doesn't know the route)** -  The passage doesn't mention anything about knowing routes.
* **D (Su otoraay bi nekkee di daw - The journey is long)** - While a long journey might add to the inconvenience, it's not the *cause* of the identity verification problems.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Ban ci yile jafe-jafe moo gëna yomba am so nekkee ci barabi tropique yu Singapore?,"The passage (P) describes Singapore's hot and humid climate, close to the equator, with high temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. It mentions ""mbir yi geenee kawe"" (literally ""forests that never die"") implying lush vegetation.  The question (Q) asks about what thrives in Singapore's tropical environment.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Suñ la agressé (Snakes are aggressive)** - While snakes might *be* present, the passage doesn't focus on their thriving or being a key feature of the environment.
* **B: ñakka mëna jot ci bitik yi (People farm in the gardens)** -  Farming isn't the primary takeaway from the description.
* **C: Dundu coono yu ab taboor waral (Dense forests that are very abundant)** - This directly aligns with the description of the climate supporting lush, evergreen forests (""mbir yi geenee kawe"").
* **D: Reer (Cows)** - Cows are not typically associated with a tropical rainforest environment.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Dundu coono yu ab taboor waral (Dense forests that are very abundant)**.  The passage strongly suggests a flourishing, dense forest environment due to the hot, wet climate.



"
Kan moo wara bëgg a moytu lekk ay patisserie wu Almaañ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kenn ku taamu deseer yu gëna riche** (Places that have rich desserts).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a pâtisserie (pastry shop) in Germany (specifically Bavaria) and Austria.** It details a variety of rich, flavorful pastries – apple pastries, cherry and plum pastries, those with whipped cream, and various types of filled doughnuts/pastries (Berliner, Pfannkuchen, Krapfen).  The focus is on the *abundance* and richness of the desserts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kenn ku am alersi yu garaaw ci xoox yi (Places that have rare allergies in food):** The passage doesn’t mention allergies.
* **C: Kenn ku bañ sokola (Places that have chocolate):** While chocolate *could* be an ingredient, it’s not the primary focus or defining characteristic of these pastries as described.
* **D: Kenn ku taamu ay xet yi neek ci kaw cafka yu neex yi (Places that have nice seats in comfortable coffee shops):** The passage mentions having coffee *with* the pastries, but the emphasis is on the pastries themselves, not the cafe atmosphere.



"
Ban ingrédient lañu jàppee ni ab mbir buñuy jëfandikoo ci patisserie Almandes yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Prunes yi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""patisserie at mi yépp ak ay cerise ak ay prune yi nga xam ni ci été bi lañuy feeñ"" (pastries with cherries and plums that are especially good in the summer). This directly links prunes (prune yi) to ingredients used in German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Pom yi (Apples):** While apples are mentioned (""pomme yuñ togg""), they're described as being *with* the pastries, not necessarily *in* them as a core ingredient.
*   **B: Noisettes yi (Hazelnuts):** Hazelnuts aren't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Amande yi (Almonds):** Almonds aren't mentioned in the passage.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile moo warul doon luñuy digle ngir tukki ci ab budget?","The correct answer is **A: Wut ay liggéey yu ndaw yooy def sooy tukki** (Some expenses are necessary to maintain a certain standard of living).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses balancing needs vs. wants.** It talks about distinguishing between essential expenses (""jamono ji ngay tukki"" - things needed to live) and discretionary spending (""ngay jéema yemale depense yi"" - things we choose to spend on).  It emphasizes careful consideration of expenses to stay within a budget.
* **Option A directly reflects this idea.** It acknowledges that some spending is *required* to maintain a baseline quality of life.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Nekk ku feex ak sa dayoob confort (I prefer my comfort):**  This represents prioritizing wants over needs, which the passage suggests *careful* consideration of, not outright preference.
    * **C: Laaj nit ñi xaalis (The needs of those who sell):** The passage doesn't focus on the sellers, but on the *buyer's* spending habits.
    * **D: Waññi xaalis bi ngay def ci lu melni lekk wala dëkkuwaay (Things we buy are often unnecessary or extravagant):** While the passage hints at avoiding extravagance, it's not its primary focus. It's about understanding *all* expenses and making informed choices.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo wara am jafe-jafey tukki ak budget bu ndaw?","The correct answer is **D: Kenn ku bëgg di topp ab yoon**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on the difficulties of managing money and expenses.** It talks about the struggle between wants and needs (""liggéey ci jamono ji ngay tukki, wala ngay jéema yemale depense yi""), and the importance of being careful with spending (""xolala gafa gi geenee tuti ngir tukki""). It describes people making bad financial choices (""dañu xelal tukkikat yi ñu baña sàcc"").
* **The question (Q) asks about managing expenses and a budget.**
* **Option D (""Kenn ku bëgg di topp ab yoon"") directly addresses this.**  ""Bëgg di topp"" means to be careful, and ""ab yoon"" relates to money/finances. It speaks to the need for prudence and careful handling of resources, which is the central theme of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kenn kuy nangu jaŋkoonteeg ab jafe-jafe:**  This refers to counting quickly, which isn't the main point.
* **B: Kenn ku amul ay waxtu yu ko tëŋk:** This relates to time management, not finances.
* **C: Kenn kuy xalaata liggéey à distance suy tukki:** This relates to communication at a distance, which is irrelevant to the passage.



"
Ban ci yile wax moo du xamle ci anam bu leer digante bi nekk Point Marion ak Fairmont ?,"The correct answer is **A: Am na ay yoon yu guddu yu ay àll yu sori**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the route between Point Marion and Fairmont is ""da ñuy faral di jaar ci ay mbédd yu sori"" which translates to ""is known for its beautiful scenery."" This directly implies the presence of beautiful roads with interesting sights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yoon yi dañoo sew** - While the passage mentions the roads are well-maintained (""yoon yu sew""), it doesn't focus on that as a main characteristic.
* **C: Lu neew lañuy nangoo topp yemale gaawaay yi** - The passage states the charging stations are a *problem* (slow/few) not a benefit.
* **D: Sàrwiisi telefon portaabal yi waru ñu nekk ab jafe-jafe** - The passage says cell service is *poor* (""ñoo gëna am doole fii kë yeneen pacc yoon wi"") not good.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Liñu ci jaaxal, sàrwiisi telefon portaabal yi ñoo gëna am doole fii kë yeneen pacc yuñu weesu ak yu jiitu..."" (In places, portable phone service is not available to cover the areas that are remote and populated...).  This directly points to limited or poor cell service being a challenge on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Caŋ ci ambuteyaas yu bu metti** (Many existing amenities) - The text mentions tolls, and the need for slower speeds due to potentially seeing wildlife, implying amenities *aren't* plentiful.
* **C: Jël ab wiraas bu seere ci lu gaaw lool** (Great views of beautiful scenery) - While the route passes through areas like Pennsylvania Wilds, the focus isn't on the beauty, but the challenges of traveling through it.
* **D: Dajeek ay liggéeyi tali yu bari** (Several expensive tolls) - While tolls are mentioned, the text doesn't emphasize them as a major drawback.



"
Ban ci yile lañu soxlawul ngir tambali ab canyoning ?,"The correct answer is **A: Man-manu feey bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Canyoning... dafa boole ay pàcc ci féey, yéeg te tëb- wante laaj na tuuti tàggatu wala nekkin bu baax ci yaram ngir tàmbali...""  This translates to ""Canyoning... is often done in water, and sometimes requires special equipment or a good physical condition for practice...""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What skills are needed to practice canyoning?""
* **Option A (""Man-manu feey bi"" - many water skills) directly aligns** with the passage's description of canyoning being done *in water*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Anami yaram yu ñoŋ (Strong physical conditions):** While the passage mentions a good physical condition *sometimes* being needed, it's not the primary skill.
* **C: Man-mani tëb (Many techniques):** The passage doesn't specifically emphasize many techniques as a core requirement.
* **D: Ab dayoob tàggat bu ndaw (Some short equipment):**  The passage mentions *special* equipment, not just *short* equipment, and skills are more fundamental than just having gear.



"
Ban ci yile lañuy soxla ngir am ab génnug canyoning bu am ndam?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab sartifikaa ci canyoning**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the physical and potentially dangerous nature of canyoning.** It mentions needing to be in good physical condition and compares it to activities like scuba diving or skiing, which require training.
* **The question (Q) asks what you need to do to safely practice canyoning.**  A certification (sartifikaa) directly addresses the need for training and preparation for a challenging activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Man-mani athlètes yu sori:**  While being athletic is helpful, it doesn't guarantee the specific skills and knowledge needed for canyoning.
* **B: Jaar-jaar ci yu yagg ci plongée wu sous-marin:**  Experience in scuba diving is *related* to dealing with water, but canyoning involves very different techniques and environments.
* **D: Man-manu feey:** Simply being numerous doesn't prepare someone for canyoning.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy am solo ci kenn mu xalaata camper ci ab ndamaaram?","The correct answer is **A: Ab nandite gu mag ci yemaley sa ndamaar.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses needing a vehicle for a ""camp"" (camping trip).** It lists different types of vehicles - minivan, SUV, Sedan, Station Wagon - and emphasizes needing something spacious.
* **The question (Q) asks about suitability for a camper.** A camper needs space.
* **Option A (""Ab nandite gu mag ci yemaley sa ndamaar"" - ""It is quite suitable for carrying your belongings"")** directly addresses the need for space to carry things for camping, making it the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ab ndamaar buy mey siis bi tëdd (""It carries only a few things"")** - This contradicts the need for a spacious vehicle.
* **C: Ab tant (""It is short"")** -  Being short isn't relevant to carrying camping gear.
* **D: Ab moomeel bu jamburé ngir camper (""It is a special vehicle for a camper"")** - The passage doesn't state it's a *specialized* camper vehicle, just a suitable vehicle *for* camping.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la ñiy camper ci woto yi bëgg a moytu suñuy jéema nekk ci suuf radar bi?","The correct answer is **A: Dawal ab ndamar bu gëna mag, mel ni ab fourgonnette**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses choosing a vehicle for camping.** It mentions minivans, SUVs, Sedans, and Station Wagons. It's clearly about finding a suitable car for travel and camping.
* **The question (Q) asks about vehicles commonly used for camping.**
* **Option A** translates to ""Cars are often large, even vans,"" which directly relates to the discussion of vehicles suitable for camping.  Vans (fourgonnette) are very common camper vehicles.
* **Option B** (""Def ab woyaas bu gëna yagg"") doesn't make sense in the context of camping.
* **Option C** (""Defar ab tant ci dëkk vi wala ab moomeel bu jamburé"") refers to buying in a store or a safari, which isn't the focus.
* **Option D** (""Ñakka miin ndamaar bi ñuy jëfandikoo"") is a general statement about people and doesn't answer the question specifically about camper vehicles.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and relevant answer based on the passage.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët, kan tabaxaat Casablanca ci ñaareelu yoon bi?","The correct answer is **A: Portugais yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Purtugees yi ño ko yàkk ba pare defaraat ko ci turu Casaa Branca..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese took it and renamed it Casa Branca...""  Casa Branca is the original name given by the Portuguese.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jaaykat yi ci Espagne:** While the Spanish later attempted to rebuild the city, they didn't *first* rename it.
*   **C: Mérénides yi:** The Mérénides were mentioned as one of the groups who had influence in the city's history, but didn't rename it.
*   **D: Sultan bu Maroc:** The Sultan of Morocco later rebuilt the city, but didn't give it its first new name.



"
Kan moo daw génn ci gëkku Casablanca bi ab musiba baba kumba amee?,"The correct answer is **D: Phoeniciens yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...di Casablanca la ay nappkat sos ci 10ème siècle balaa JC te ñi ko njëkoon na yor doon ay **Phénicien**, ay Romain ak Mérénide yi..."" (Casablanca's history dates back to the 10th century BC, and it was settled by the **Phoenicians**, Romans and Merinides...).

Therefore, the Phoenicians were among the first to settle in Casablanca.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan la Sintra def ba waa bitim-réew raññee ko?","The correct answer is **A: Cabo da Roca**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bisu Scotturb 403 dafay dem saa su nekk ci Sintra, **di taxaw ci Cabo da Roca.**"" This directly translates to ""They traveled from Sintra **to Cabo da Roca**.""  The question asks what Sintra leads to, and the text clearly states it leads to Cabo da Roca.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Feeñug Marie (Shrine of Mary):** While they visited Notre-Dame de Fatima (a shrine of Mary), the text doesn't say Sintra *leads* to it.
*   **C: Addu yu baax yu Lord Byron (The works of Lord Byron):** The text mentions Lord Byron as someone who stayed in Sintra, but it doesn't say Sintra leads to his works.
*   **D: Jaar-jaaram ci wallum mbëgeel (A visit to a sandy beach):** The text doesn't mention beaches.



"
Lan la Armenie nangu wul?,"The correct answer is **A: Diiwaanu Nagorno-Karabakh bi** (The region of Nagorno-Karabakh).

Here's why:

The passage states that Armenia ""amna beneen réew bu bees buñu taxawal"" (claimed a self-governed region) and that this region was ""diwaanu xeetu waa Armeni Nagorno-Karabakh bu Azerbaijan"" (the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which was part of Azerbaijan).  Therefore, Nagorno-Karabakh is what Armenia claimed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xeex bimu amal ak waa Azeris** (Conflicts with Azerbaijanis) - This describes *what happened* in the region, not what Armenia claimed.
* **C: Waxi diplomatik yu Azerbaijan** (Azerbaijan's diplomatic efforts) - This is about Azerbaijan's actions, not Armenia's claims.
* **D: Repiblik bu bees bi** (A self-governed republic) - While Armenia *created* a self-governed republic in the region, the question asks what Armenia *claimed*, which was the territory itself.



"
Lan moo wey di indi ay lorange ci lëkkëloo yi am digante Azerbaijan ak Arménie?,"The correct answer is **D: Diiwaanu Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ci atum 1994, diwaanu xeetu waa Armeni Nagorno-Karabakh bu Azerbaijan no dem xare ak waa Azeris."" This means the conflict centered around the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  The passage then explains how this led to ongoing tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doomi Amerig i dëgg Azerbaijan:** The passage doesn't mention the US's support of Azerbaijan.
* **B: Geeru 1994:** While 1994 is mentioned, it's as a *time* of a situation, not the *cause* of the conflict.
* **C: Waxi diplomat yi:** The passage doesn't specifically mention diplomatic efforts as the source of the ongoing issues.



"
"Sooy jël ab taxi ci Charlotte, lan mooy mêna waral nga feyaat leneen?","The correct answer is **D: Bëgg njabóot** (Expensive transportation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taksi njabooti Charlotte bariwul li nu kay jëfandikoo..."" which translates to ""Taxis in Charlotte are expensive, which is why we often don't find them.""
* The question asks about the *reason* taxis are hard to find. The passage directly links the high cost to their scarcity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dëkk ci beneen barab** (Difficult to find in general) - While implied, the passage specifically points to *cost* as the issue, not just general difficulty.
* **B: Am ñetti kiliyaan** (They have many kilometers) - This is mentioned but isn't the reason they are hard to find. It's a detail about the distances.
* **C: Dem ci biir dëkk bu mag bi** (They go to big shopping areas) - This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan nañu mëna jàppee niki lu neexul ci dëkk Charlotte ak ay xale?","The correct answer is **A: Njëgu dëkkuwaay yi** (The shopkeepers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ñeneen ñi bawoo ci yeneen gox yi dañuy wax ni dëkkaale gu neex gi moo leen fi neex, neena ñu dëkk bu neex la soo àndee ak ay xale.""  This translates to: ""Some of those who live in the shops often talk about the good deals they have, and they sell well with people.""  This clearly indicates the shopkeepers are the ones benefiting from the good deals and interacting with customers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jël ab taxi (Taxi ride):** While taxis are mentioned, the passage doesn't say they *benefit* from the good deals.
* **C: Ñi dëkkee ci yeneeni barab (Those who live in the neighborhoods):** The passage focuses on those *in the shops*, not the general neighborhood.
* **D: Jéema dundu lu neex ci dëkk bi (Good things in the shop):**  The passage doesn't identify *things* as benefiting, but *people* (the shopkeepers).



"
"Laata Espagnol yi di aksi, kan moo jiite woon xaaj bi feete kaw ci Chili?","The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...boobë nittu Araucanians (Mapuche) dëkkon ci diggu ak bëj-saalumu Ciili."" This translates to ""...the strong Araucanians (Mapuche) who lived in the south and center of Chile.""  It further explains they fiercely resisted the Spanish and played a key role in preventing complete Spanish dominance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Doomi amerig yi** (Indigenous Americans) - Too broad. While the Mapuche *are* Indigenous Americans, the question asks specifically who resisted the Spanish.
*   **C: Araucaniens yi** -  While historically used, ""Araucaniens"" is an older, sometimes problematic term for the Mapuche. The text itself clarifies that Mapuche *are* the Araucanians.  The question asks for the group, and Mapuche is the self-identified name.
*   **D: Incas yi** - The Incas were further north and their empire had already fallen by the time of the significant Spanish conflict in Chile.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile moo xewul woon ci atum 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chili moo jël ndam li ci kaw Espagne** (Chile began to fight for independence from Spain).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Donté Chile moomonna boppam ci atum 1810 ( ci xééxi Napoleon yi yaxxon Spain ba amul woon njiit ci gnaari at)..."" This translates to ""Therefore, Chile began its independence in 1810 (during the time Napoleon invaded Spain and weakened its control)...""  This clearly indicates the start of a struggle for independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nguur gu mag gi teewul woon:** (Something big happened) - Too vague, the text specifies *what* happened.
* **C: Geeru Napoléon lañu doon amal:** (Napoleon's defeat caused it) - While Napoleon's invasion of Spain *created the opportunity* for Chilean independence, the text says Chile *began* its fight in 1810, during the invasion, not after Napoleon's defeat.
* **D: Chili dafa laajoon indépendance:** (Chile achieved independence) - The text says independence was *declared* in 1818, not 1810. 1810 was the *beginning* of the process.



"
Nan la nit ñi mënaa àgg ci wilaas yu sori ci diiwaanu Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci woto wala ci otoraay**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yoon yi, otoraay ak bato yi dañuy boole wilaas yi, te kaar yi mënu ñu àgg foofu sunu jaaree ci biti.""  This translates to ""People, authorities and boats use the coastal villages, and cars can only access them with limitations.""

Therefore, people access the villages by foot (woto) or by boat (otoraay). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci woto wala ci gaal:**  ""Gaal"" means outside. The text doesn't mention accessing the villages from *outside*.
* **C: Ci otoraay wala ci gaal:**  Again, ""gaal"" is irrelevant.
* **D: Ci roplaan wala ci otoraay:** ""Roplaan"" means plane. There's no mention of accessing the villages by plane.



"
Lan la baatu Italien bii di ‘Cinque Terre’ di tekki?,"The correct answer is **A: Juróomi wilaas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""moo boole juróomi wilaas yu ndaw yi ci kotu Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza ak Monterosso..."" which translates to ""...beautiful coastal villages located in the towns of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso...""
* The question asks what ""Cinque Terre"" is known for. The passage directly identifies it as being known for its coastal villages (""juróomi wilaas"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Juróomi mbédd (forest villages):** The passage doesn't mention forests or forest villages.
* **C: Juróomi falaise (cliff villages):** While the villages *are* built on cliffs, the passage emphasizes they are *coastal* villages first.
* **D: Juróomi géej (beach villages):**  The passage doesn't focus on beaches, but rather on the villages themselves and their setting.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xêt bi, ban xeeti dàll bot moo baax ci anami séddaay yuy tarxiisal?","The correct answer is **C: Dàll bot yu am ay talon yu kawe**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Yenn dàll yi am nañu ay karampon te de nu ci dolli ay jumtukaayu karampong ngir anami tarxiiis, baax ci dàll wala bott yu bari, ngir taloon yi. Talon yi dañoo wara gàtt te yaatu.""  This translates to ""Some of the balls have hooks and are placed in strong containers for easier handling, especially large balls or barrels, for the claws. The claws are made strong and durable.""  This directly refers to balls having claws (talon yu kawe).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dàll bot yu am talon yu sew:** The text says the claws are strong and durable (""wara gàtt te yaatu""), not necessarily ""sew"" (smooth).
* **B: Dàll bot yu am ay jumtukaay yuñu def ak weñ:** While the text mentions containers (""jumtukaay""), it doesn't connect them specifically to making handling easier.
* **D: Dàll bot yu amul 1/5 de pouce ci xootaay:**  The text mentions 5mm (1/5 inch) as the *motif's* size, not the balls themselves.



"
Ban ci yile moo dul tax ñu mën amal ay yeesal ci xêcc ci tali yi ci jamonoy séddaay?,"The correct answer is **A: Xorom**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Suuf si, Garawaa yi wala xorom si (Kloriiru Kalsiyoom) dañuy faral di tasaaroo ci tali yi wala ci yoon wi ngir yombal xëcc gi.""  This directly translates to ""Lastly, chlorine (Calcium Chloride) is often used to de-ice roads or surfaces.""

Therefore, *Xorom* (chlorine) is used to treat ice on roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Grawaay:** This isn't mentioned in the context of treating ice.
*   **C: Suuf:** While *suuf* is mentioned, it's a transition word (""Lastly"") and doesn't relate to ice treatment.
*   **D: Ndox:** This isn't mentioned in the passage in relation to ice treatment.



"
Ban ci yile mooy luy niro bu baax ak Hawaii ak Duunu yu Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ñoo bokk waxtu** (They share time zones).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Moom ak Hawaï ñoo bokk fuseau horaire, yenn saay ñu leen di woowe """"Hawaii bi ci suuf"""".""  This directly translates to ""They and Hawaii share a time zone, and people often say 'Hawaii is to the east'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñoom ñaar ñéppa ay otel yu mag** (They both have many large hotels) - While the passage mentions hotels in the Cook Islands, it doesn't say Hawaii *also* has many large hotels as a point of comparison.
* **B: Ñoom ñaar ñépp amu statut Etat** (They both have state status) - The passage doesn't mention the political status of either place.
* **D: Ñoom ñaar ñépp amu ñu ay dëkk** (They both have many shops) - The passage doesn't talk about shops in either location.



"
Ban ci yile moo dul xamle Duuni Cook ci anam gu leer?,"The correct answer is **C: Dëkk yi ci gëna mag ñooy Rarotonga ak Aitutaki** (The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yiñ ci gëna ràññee ñooy Rarotonga ak Aitutaki."" which translates to ""The most important islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moo gëna tuuti Hawaii** (They are close to Hawaii) - While the passage mentions a relationship with Hawaii's time zone and tourism, it doesn't state they are *close* geographically.
* **B: Ñoom ñaar ñépp ay archipel lañu** (They are just another archipelago) - This is too general and doesn't represent a specific detail from the passage.
* **D: Réewu duun yi ñoo bokk benn waxtu ak Hawaii** (These countries share a time zone with Hawaii) - The passage mentions a similar time zone, but focuses on Cook Islands' time zone *being like* Hawaii’s, not necessarily sharing it directly.



"
Ban ci yile post garde forestier mooy joxe ñaari xeeti tànnéefi dëkkuwaay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena mooy benn bërëb ranger bi lay jox foy fanan ak lékk gu tàng."" This translates to ""Sirena is a main ranger station with access to trails and a challenging hike."" This directly indicates Sirena is a ranger station.

The other options are described as places *with* trails, but not as ranger stations themselves.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, fan nga mëna jàppee ab permis garaas so bëggee jëfandikoo xaalis bu teew bu bokkul ak keredi?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

The text states: ""CafeNet El Sol joxe na am sàrwiisu jàpp palaas ci njëggu US$30, wama $10 ngir paasu benn bis; mën nga gis leeral yi ci seen xëtu Corcivado."" This directly translates to ""CafeNet El Sol has a computer service for $30, or $10 for printing, so you can get your permits on their computer in Corcovado.""

The question asks where you can *get* permits, and CafeNet El Sol is the only place mentioned that specifically offers a service to help you *obtain* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sirena:** Sirena is a ranger station and mentioned as needing a ticket to enter, but doesn't *provide* the permit service.
*   **B: Puerto Jiménez:** Puerto Jiménez is where the Ranger Station is, and you need a bank card to get a permit *there*, but the text doesn't say you get the permit *at* Puerto Jiménez, just the station within it.
*   **D: La Leona:** La Leona is just a location within the park, not a place to get permits.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu skiing lañu def ci barab bu am ay eskaliyee?","The correct answer is **A: Ski de randonnée**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes skiing that involves going up mountains ( ""mu laaj ski ak dallu bot yu gëna dëggër"") and then skiing down (""bi mujj bi danu ko def ci bayaal bu tooy"").** This is the core characteristic of *ski de randonnée* (also known as ski touring or backcountry skiing).  It's about exploring beyond prepared slopes.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ski buñu dul def ci piste:** This describes downhill skiing on prepared slopes – the passage specifically mentions going *up* mountains.
    * **C: Istilu yéeg:** This refers to ice skating, not skiing.
    * **D: Randonnée à ski:** While *randonnée* means hiking/trekking, ""Randonnée à ski"" is a bit redundant as *ski de randonnée* directly means ""ski for touring.""  The passage focuses on the *skiing* aspect as a combination of ascent and descent.

* **The question (Q) asks about skiing that involves climbing with escaliers (likely meaning using skins or other methods for uphill travel).**  *Ski de randonnée* is the only type of skiing that inherently involves climbing.



"
"Sunu sukandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy mëna jàppale ñiy def ski de randonnée yu bëgg àgg ci gaawaay bu gëna kawe?","The correct answer is **B: Sac à dos bu diis**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly mentions:** ""...mu laaj ski ak dallu bot yu gëna dëggër"" which translates to ""...he carries skis with a large backpack.""  Later it says ""...ay gaawaayu ski de fond bu andul ak sak bu diis buñuy boot ci yoon yuñu rëdd"" which translates to ""...ski touring equipment including a suitable backpack for long journeys.""
* **The question (Q) asks** about equipment used for ski de randonnée (ski touring).  A backpack is essential for carrying everything needed for a ski touring trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bot yu gëna dëggër (Large boots):** While boots are important, the question is specifically about *carrying* equipment.
* **C: Anam yu baax (Good conditions):**  This refers to weather conditions, not equipment.
* **D: Piste yuñu rëdd (Prepared slopes):** Ski touring typically happens *off* prepared slopes.



"
Wey-tukki yuy ab chogu dugg dañuy am jafe-jafe ngir def lan?,"The correct answer is **C: Tukki bitim-réew**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the difficulties and challenges of moving to a new country (tukki bitim-réew - changing countries) after a honeymoon.** It highlights the contrast between the initial joy and the subsequent hardships. The passage focuses on the struggles of adapting and the longing for the past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Miin cosaanu barab bu bees:** (A beautiful life is valuable) - While the initial life *was* beautiful, the passage focuses on its *loss* and the difficulties following.
* **B: Nekk ku teey te andak dal:** (I am content and peaceful) -  The passage describes the *opposite* – discontent and struggle.
* **D: Jotaat ci seeni cosaanu bopp:** (Problems in your beautiful life) - This is too general. The core issue isn't just *problems*, but the specific upheaval of moving to a new country.



Therefore, **Tukki bitim-réew (changing countries)** directly relates to the central theme of the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, chogu dugg dina mëna nekk lu jafe lool ci ban xeeti wey-tukki?","The correct answer is **C: Wey-tukki yu nekk ci lune de miel ba tey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""lune de miel bi"" (the honeymoon)** and describes the couple's travels *after* their honeymoon. The entire passage focuses on the journey *following* that initial period.
* The question asks about the most significant/memorable travels. The honeymoon (lune de miel) is presented as a key starting point for all subsequent travels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wey-tukki chogu cosaan yu bon lool (Travels to very beautiful places):** While the travels are likely beautiful, the passage doesn't emphasize beauty as the *defining* characteristic. It focuses on the journey's context relative to the honeymoon.
* **B: Wey-tukki yuy miin ci lu gaaw suñu dëkkee bitim-réew (Travels that are few in number and hard to find in foreign lands):** The passage doesn't suggest the travels are rare or difficult to find.
* **D: Wey-tukki yu andul ak dàl (Travels that are long and tiring):** The passage mentions difficulties and challenges, but doesn't characterize the travels specifically as long and tiring.



"
Ban ci yile la nit ñi waral mooytu di def ak nagu àll?,"The correct answer is **B: Jege ko bu baax**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) talks about a moose being beautiful and majestic.** It describes its size and grace. The line ""wayé dinagnu aar sén bopp bugnulén songé"" translates to ""it is beautiful in its grandeur and majesty.""  The passage emphasizes the moose's impressive qualities.
* **Option B (""Jege ko bu baax"" - It is very beautiful)** directly reflects this sentiment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñakka bayyi xel ci seen tewaay (Some people are sad about its fate):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the moose's fate or anyone being sad.
* **C: Neewal seen dayoo fitna buñu mëna waral (Its shape is strange and not beautiful):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
* **D: Di leen xool fu sori (It causes trouble for people):**  The passage doesn't indicate the moose causes any problems.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that accurately captures the main idea of the passage regarding the moose's appearance."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, Ban ci yile kàddu ci nangu àll yi mo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **A: Ay mala yu soxor lañu naturellement**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) talks about moose being shy and preferring to stay hidden.**  It says they don't like being seen (""soxorugnu lool"") and prefer to be in places where they won't be disturbed.
* **Q (the question) asks about animals that naturally avoid humans.**
* **Option A (""Ay mala yu soxor lañu naturellement"" - ""These animals are naturally shy"")** directly addresses this.  It aligns with the description of moose in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Duñ leen faral di jàppee niki ñu mêna waral ay fitna (""They only approach if they need something from people"")** - The passage doesn't indicate moose *approach* people. It states they *avoid* them.
* **C: Nit yu nekk seen wet mën nañ leen yëngël (""People who live near them find them friendly"")** - This contradicts the passage, which describes them as shy.
* **D: Dina ñu àar seen bopp su ko jaree (""They only care about their young and ignore everything else"")** - While parental care is important, the passage focuses on their shyness, not their sole focus on offspring.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy doon bi ci gëna ñakka dangereux ngir ab wey-tukki ci desert bi?","The correct answer is **B: Gis ab mirage buy def lu melni ndox**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation of being lost in the desert (tukki), seeing something that *appears* to be water (melni ndox), and realizing it's an illusion.**  The entire text revolves around this deceptive mirage.
* **Option B** directly addresses this – it states that the phenomenon is a mirage that deceives you into thinking there's water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ñakkum yere yu tang ci guddi gu sédd:** While people can get lost in the desert, this doesn't explain the *illusion* of water.
* **C: Yaqum enersi sooy topp mirage bi:**  This says energy causes the mirage, but the passage focuses on the *experience* of seeing it, not its cause.
* **D: Yaqum ndox sooy topp mirage bi:** This says water causes the mirage, which is the opposite of what the passage implies.  The mirage *looks* like water, but isn't water.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the context of the passage."
Ban ci yile lañu xamle ni ab fitna buñu njort ngir wey-tukki yi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mirages**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation of extreme heat and thirst in the desert.**  It talks about a ""long journey,"" seeing water (""luy mélni ndox"") that isn't real, and feeling exhaustion. This strongly points to the experience of mirages - optical illusions caused by heat that make it appear as though water is present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Deñc ndox (Dreams of water):** While the *feeling* of wanting water might be dream-like, the passage describes *seeing* something, implying a visual hallucination rather than a dream.
* **C: Hypothermie (Hypothermia):** Hypothermia is dangerously low body temperature. The passage describes intense heat, the opposite of hypothermia.
* **D: Weeru ci naaj (Madness from the sun):** While sun exposure can contribute to mental distress, the specific description of *seeing* water that isn't there is a classic symptom of a mirage, not just general sun-induced madness.



"
"Sunu sukkadndikoo ci xët bi, ban kuréelu askan lañu indil ay lorange yu metti bi exploreurs yi aksee?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sunu sukkandikoo ci Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias) digante 1492 ak 1498 conquereur yu Españ nañu lu toll ci 100,000 Taínos.""  This directly translates to ""This suffering mentioned by Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies) between 1492 and 1498, Spanish conquerors caused the death of 100,000 Taínos.""

Therefore, the passage is talking about the suffering *of* the Taínos.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban lakk la Caraïbes yi di lakk?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Làkk wi Caribe yi daan làkk mooy arawakan, dalee ko lu jiitu 10 000 lu jiitu JC.""  This directly translates to ""The original language of the Caribbean people was Arawakan, dating back to 10,000 BC.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haïtien:** While Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, the text doesn't say Haitian was the *original* language.
*   **B: Espagniol (Spanish):** Spanish came *after* the original inhabitants and through colonization.
*   **C: Anglais (English):** English is not mentioned as a language of the original Caribbean people in this text.



"
Kan lañu wara nangul ni mooy ki siiwal ski niki ab po bu joxe mbekte?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bums**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ski dafa nekk powum tukki gu am solo boole ci dey beggal xol, ñu xam ko yen saay ci “ski bums”...""  This translates to: ""Ski has a group of people who live only for it all winter, they are known as “ski bums”...""

Therefore, the text directly identifies ""ski bums"" as those who dedicate their lives to skiing.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lu jege ban jamono lañu njëkka nangu ski niki ab tàggat-yaram?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 LAATA YEESU**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xalaatu def ski lu yàgg a am la – amna peinture représentant des skieurs remontent à 5000 avant JC!""  This translates to: ""The history of skiing goes back a long way - a painting depicting skiers dates back to 5000 BC!""

Therefore, the earliest evidence of skiing, according to the text, is from 5000 years ago.



"
Ban ci yile lañuy mengale li ci ëpp ak duunu Côte Est bu Afrique?,"The correct answer is **C: All bi** (All of the above).

Here's why:

* **Influence bu Orop (European Influence):** The passage explicitly mentions European colonization starting in the 15th century with the Portuguese and their impact on trade routes.  It also notes France's colonial presence and influence.
* **Diiney lislaam (Islamic Religion):** The passage states ""Arabs yi tamit indi nagnu Islam ci suuf si..."" meaning Arabs introduced Islam to the region, influencing Comoros and Mayotte.
* **All bi (All of the above):** Because both European influence *and* Islam are mentioned as significant factors shaping the East African coast, ""All bi"" is the most comprehensive and accurate answer.



"
Lan moo ekkul lu gëna ndaw ci luñuy mengale ak duuni Côte Ouest bu Afrique? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ab lëkkaloo ak Farans**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...te nu gën leen xam ci tefes yu bàkkane. Arabs yi tamit indi nagnu Islam ci suuf si, té jeelna lu yagg ci Comoros ak Mayotte. Doole waa Ërop gi ak koloñalism door na ci 15eelu xarnu bi...""  This translates to ""...and we showed them the trades. The Arabs brought Islam with them to the south, and we went to Comoros and Mayotte. European trade and colonialism began in the 15th century...""

The question asks about connections to the West African coast. The passage clearly indicates interaction (trades, colonization) with Europeans, specifically mentioning France through the context of influence and potential control. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay resort deluxe yu bari** - The passage doesn't mention resorts.
* **C: Luñu xam ci all bi** - While the passage mentions knowing things, it's not the primary connection to the West African coast.
* **D: Moomeel ci yeneeni réew** -  The passage focuses on interactions *with* other places, not simply existing within a country.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan la yenn nit yu xarañ ci jangu yu yàgg yi?","The correct answer is **A: Amal ay ñaan ngir ñu mêna jur**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses preparations for Easter.** It mentions cleaning the church, preparing for services, and the importance of the religious season.  The phrase ""jant wi suy jóg"" refers to Easter.
* **The question (Q) asks what is being prepared for in the text, particularly relating to people preparing.**
* **Option A (""Amal ay ñaan ngir ñu mêna jur"" - There is food prepared for those who will fast) directly relates to the preparations for Easter and the fasting often associated with it.**  Preparing food *is* a part of preparing for a religious observance like Easter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nos ab veillée wu gaawu ci guddi (We had a vigil in the church) -** While vigils *might* happen during Easter, the passage doesn't specifically mention one being prepared for.
* **C: Nos ab feetu jamonoy sédd ngir mbootaay bi (We prepared a gift for the community) -** The passage doesn't mention any gifts being prepared.
* **D: Seetaan wàccu naaj wi (The students came to visit) -**  The passage doesn't mention students or visits.



Therefore, **A** is the most directly supported answer based on the provided text."
"Ngir moytu yenn càkkutéef yi sooy dugg Equateur, ab doomu Cuba lan la wara am?","The correct answer is **B: Ab bataaxal invitation buñu legalisé** (A legalized invitation letter).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Waa Kuba yi yor Kàrt bu wert bu Amerig war nanu dem konsulaa bu ekuwatër ngir am ab keyt buy may nu dem ci boobule càkuteef."" This translates to ""Cubans living in North America need to go to the Ecuadorian consulate to get a permit to enter Ecuador as tourists.""  The text then mentions needing a passport, but *specifically* links the permit to the need for an invitation letter.
* **The text continues:** ""...Sa paspor warna baax ci lumu bon bon juróom benni weer ci bési say tukki."" (Their passport should be in good condition with at least six months of validity). This reinforces the passport requirement, but the invitation is the key to *getting* the permit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ab passport bu baax bu 6 weer yu ëpp bisu tukki yi:** While a valid passport is needed, the text focuses on the *additional* requirement for Cubans.
* **C: Ab tiket dem ak dikk ngir firndéel yaggaayu dëkk bi:** A ticket is likely needed, but not the primary requirement for *permission to enter* as highlighted in the text.
* **D: Ab Carte grise bu Amerig:** A ""Carte grise"" is a vehicle registration document and irrelevant to tourist entry.



"
Ngir ban sabab lañu defarul waréefi tukki yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Weyal limu wey-tukki yi ci dayoo bu gëna ndaw** (They want to renew their passports because they are nearing their expiration date).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Sa paspor warna baax ci lumu bon bon juróom benni weer ci bési say tukki."" This translates to ""Their passports are close to their expiration date and need to be renewed before their trips.""
* This directly explains the reason for wanting to renew – the passports are expiring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Weyal ab lawaayu dem ak dikk buñu nos** (They want to travel with different names than theirs) - The text doesn't mention anything about name changes.
* **C: Firndeel ab diirub dëkk** (They want to open a store) - This is unrelated to the passage.
* **D: Garanti baaxaayu passports yi** (To guarantee the validity of their passports) - While renewing *guarantees* validity, the *reason* for renewing is the approaching expiration date, not just a general desire for validity.



"
Ban ci yile mooy mëna gêna seer bitim-réew ba raw fi ngeen dëkk?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaadar yi am maana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Kaadar yi am màndarga yu mag te jàppandi ci bërëb yooyule mënes nañoo am ñaari jafe jafe..."" which translates to ""Drivers with large means and who participate in the expenses of many families have very good benefits...""  This clearly refers to drivers who have financial resources (""maana"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cambarug bët (Good tires):** While important, the passage doesn't focus on tires.
* **C: Asiransu bët (Good insurance):** Insurance is mentioned, but it's not the *primary* benefit described for this group of drivers.
* **D: Kaadar yu amul marque (Drivers with branded cars):** The passage discusses financial means, not the type of car.

**Therefore, the passage's core point regarding benefits for these drivers is tied to their financial capability (Kaadar yi am maana).**



"
Lan mooy wara doon risku jënd ay kaadar yu am maana ci bitim-réew?,"The correct answer is **A: Mën nañ la laaj nga def beneen cambaru bët**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the risks faced by people migrating/traveling, specifically mentioning the dangers of the journey itself (""bitim réew"") and the challenges of integrating into new countries.** It highlights the hardships, exploitation, and potential for things to go wrong.
* **Option A (""Mën nañ la laaj nga def beneen cambaru bët"" - ""There is a risk of meeting bad/difficult things on the journey"") directly reflects this idea of facing hardship and danger during the migration process.**  ""Cambaru bët"" refers to challenging or difficult situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ordinaas bi mëna baña baax ci yenn kaadar yi (""Ordinances which help people with their cases"")** - The passage doesn't focus on legal assistance, but rather the *problems* people encounter.
* **C: Mën nañu doon yu faux (""There are false doors/opportunities"")** - While exploitation could be considered a ""false opportunity,"" the passage speaks to broader, more immediate risks beyond just deception.
* **D: Asisrans mën na baña nangu jël njëg li (""Insurance doesn't help much with anything"")** - The passage *mentions* insurance (""su asurãns bi aare""), but doesn't make a general statement about its ineffectiveness. It's presented as one element people consider, but not a solution to all risks.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer, capturing the central theme of the risks associated with migration as described in the passage."
"Lu àju ci jëfandikoo xaalis ci Falklands, yan ci yile kaddu ñooy dëgg?","The correct answer is **D: Suñ ci gennee livre bu Falkland, livre sterling mooy faral di nekk xaalis buñu nangu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Xaalisu Falklands bu nu dëggal mooy poun bu Flakland (FKP) nga xam nenjëgam danu ko def mu tolloog pound bu Angalteer (GBP)."" This directly translates to ""The Falklands currency is not legal tender, it is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).""  It further explains that British Pounds (livre sterling) are widely accepted.
* The passage also mentions that while dollars are accepted in some places, the primary and most reliable currency for transactions is the British Pound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While credit cards and sterling are accepted, this isn't the *most* important thing to know about the currency situation.
* **B:** Stanley accepting dollars is a minor point, not a key feature of the financial system.
* **C:**  The Falkland Pound itself isn't widely used *outside* the islands; the British Pound is what's commonly accepted for transactions.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, sooy tukki bawoo Falklands ci Etats-Unis, fan la ab anamu pay bu wuuteek kartu keredi doonee lu am solo?","The correct answer is **A: Ci butiku FIC WEST**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Xaalis mënees na ko weccee ci benn bànk bi amm ci dun yeup, bànk bangi fetée ci biir Stanley ca butiku FIC WEST.""  This translates to ""Money can be exchanged at banks in the city, a bank located in Stanley at the FIC WEST shop.""

The question asks where you can exchange Falklands currency in the US (implied, because it asks about using credit cards). While the text doesn't *directly* say it's in the US, it identifies FIC WEST as the place to exchange currency related to the Falklands, and it's reasonable to assume that's where someone from the US would go to exchange/use currency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci biir duuni bi yépp** - The text mentions ""biir duuni"" (city bank) but doesn't specify it's where exchanges are done.
* **C: Ci duuni yi ko wër** - The text doesn't mention any general shops or places.
* **D: Ci biir Stanley** -  While FIC WEST is *in* Stanley, the answer is more specific - it's at the FIC WEST shop *within* Stanley.



"
Ban xew-xew lañu mengalewul ak buñu feeté temple bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Xew-xew yu mag yuy am jeexital ci temple bi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Festival yu temple Kerala yi daño jara seetaan, ak ñay yuñu dekoore faral di romb, orchestre bu temple ak yeneen xew-xew."" This translates to ""The temple festivals of Kerala are very famous, and people decorate with colorful clothes, temple orchestras and *various new things*.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Juddug ab ñay:** (Just people) - The passage mentions more than just people.
* **B: Bisu juddu temple bi:** (Only the temple people) - The passage implies participation from the general public too.
* **C: Bisu juddu ab yalla:** (Only the people of God) - This is too specific and not supported by the text.



Therefore, option D is the most encompassing and accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Fan lañu mêna gisee ay ñay yuñu dekooré?,"The correct answer is **D: Ci mbeddi Kerala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Festival yu temple Kerala yi daño jara seetaan, ak ñay yuñu dekoore faral di romb, orchestre bu temple ak yeneen xew-xew.""  This directly translates to ""The temple festivals of Kerala are very numerous, and people decorate brightly with flowers, temple orchestras and new things.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage mentions November to May as a *time period*, not where the decoration happens.
* **B:** While the decorations are *at* temples, it doesn't say that's where the people *are* decorating.
* **C:** This is about the *purpose* of the decorations, not *where* they take place.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy anam buñu gëna yaakaar ngir sakkanal xaalis ci première classe wala ci classe affaires?","The correct answer is **B: Jàpp palaas yu gëna seer bayyi classe affaires**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yoon bi gënna leer ngir jël business class mooy nga genne xaalis bu bare ngir lu rey loolu..."" (Someone wanting to travel business class often finds the price too high).  It then goes on to describe people finding ways to get cheaper fares, particularly those willing to take connecting flights.
* **Option B** directly reflects this – people are *looking for* (gëna seer) ways to get business class (classe affaires) at a better price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Teg ko ci ndoddu këru-liggéeyukaay bi** (It depends on the airline's rules) - While airline rules play a part, the passage focuses on *people's actions* to find cheaper fares, not just the rules.
* **C: Jàpp ab vol bu direktul ci première classe** (People fly directly in first class) - The passage is about *finding ways to afford* higher classes, not people simply flying first class.
* **D: Wut ab waññi ci njëg li** (People prefer to wait for a discount) - The passage doesn't mention waiting for discounts specifically, but rather proactively seeking cheaper routes.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy doon yaq sa temps di wut sooy jàpp palaas ci yenn classes u njëg yi?","The correct answer is **B: Classe affaires yi** (Business Class).

Here's why:

The passage focuses heavily on the advantages of Business Class (""business class mooy nga genne xaalis bu bare..."") and contrasts it with economy class. The question asks about what is being discussed in the text, and the core of the text revolves around Business Class and its benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vol direct yi** (Direct flights) - While mentioned as a possible benefit, it's not the central topic.
*   **C: Wàññi yi** (Discounts) - Discounts are mentioned in relation to booking, but aren't the main subject.
*   **D: Première classe** (First Class) - First Class isn't mentioned in the text at all.

Lan lañuy soxlawul yokk suñuy méngale ab mbooleem njëg jëm Afrique ak ab njëgu tour du monde?,"The correct answer is **A: Njëgu visas yuñu dolli ngir barab yu nekkul Afrique** (Difficulties obtaining visas for travel in Africa).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Bulen fate yokk si njëg luy dem ci visa yi, juuti yuñuy dolli ci depaar yi..."" This translates to ""Difficulties exist in obtaining visas, travel is often difficult due to departures...""
* This directly addresses the question of what makes travel *within* Africa and connecting to global travel challenging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Njêgi juuti wu tukki yi ci Afrique** (Difficulties with flights in Africa) - The passage mentions connection issues but doesn't primarily focus on the flights themselves being difficult.
* **C: Njëgu visa wu Africain** (African visas) - The passage focuses on the *difficulty* of getting visas, not the visas themselves.
* **D: Jëgu dem ak dikk ngir barab yu nekk ci biti Afrique** (Travel and accommodation for people in Africa) - This is too broad. The passage is specifically about the barriers *to* travel, not the experience *of* travel once someone is already there.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci lan la supermarchés yi di tambalee jaay ab tànneef bu gëna bari ay mbir?","The correct answer is **A: Ñam buñu togg ba noppi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ci lu gëna bari supermarsé yi dañoo nekk di am tànnéefu lekk buñu togg ba noppi bu wuute lool.""  This translates to: ""In many supermarkets, you can find ready-to-eat food (specifically 'ñam buñu togg ba noppi') which is very convenient.""

The question asks what is commonly found in supermarkets to help with quick meals.  Ready-to-eat food fits this description perfectly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Four u Micro-onde (Oven or Microwave):** While supermarkets *sell* these, they aren't what the passage highlights as being readily available *in* the supermarket to make meals easier.
* **C: Restoran yi ci dëkk bi (Restaurants in the store):**  The passage doesn't mention restaurants within supermarkets.
* **D: Njëg yu yomb (Fruits and Vegetables):**  While supermarkets sell these, the passage specifically focuses on *prepared* food for convenience, not raw ingredients.

Yan jumtukaay yu yenn supermarchés yi di joxe ñooy mêna xëcc ab kiliyaan buy jënd ay ñam yuñu togg ba noppi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ab tànnéef bu wuutewul noonu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ci lu gëna bari supermarsé yi dañoo nekk di am tànnéefu lekk buñu togg ba noppi bu wuute lool.""  This translates to: ""Often in big supermarkets, they have ready-to-eat food that is very tasty.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What do supermarkets often have to quickly eat?
* **Option B (""Ab tànnéef bu wuutewul noonu"" - Ready-to-eat food) directly answers this question.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Restaurant yi fa nekk (Restaurants are there):** The passage doesn't focus on restaurants.
* **C: ñam bu ñorul (Normal food):**  This is too general. The question asks about *quick* options.
* **D: Ab four u Micro-onde (Ovens and Microwaves):** These are appliances, not food *in* the supermarket.

Ban ci yile lañu warul al Belge ak Swiss yuy lakk français lañu mëna baña dégg?,"The correct answer is **A: Sistermu joxe ay nimero bu français standard bi** (The use of a different numbering system in French standard).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Rawatina, anam wi waa Belgique biy làkk francais ak ci waa Suisse di defee seeni nimero xawna wuute ak ni ko ñiy làkk francais bu réewum France di defee, waxiinu yenn baat yi xaw nañu wuute tuuti.""  This translates to: ""However, while people in Belgium and Switzerland speak French and don't have the same numbering system as the French in France, this causes some difficulties in understanding.""
* **The passage then continues to explain** that Belgian and Swiss French speakers learn standard French in school, but still use their own numbering systems, leading to confusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baati français yu xejjiku (Different French words):** While there *might* be some regional vocabulary differences, the passage focuses specifically on *numbers*.
* **C: Yenn anam yuñuy waxee ay baat ci français (People who speak different things in French):** This is too vague. The issue isn't just *what* they say, but *how* they say numbers.
* **D: Français buñuy gëna lakk ci France (French that is only spoken in France):**  The passage highlights that Belgian and Swiss French are *different* from French spoken in France, not that French from France is exclusive.



"
Ban ci yile moo bokkul ak bi am France niki ci Belgique wala Swiss?,"The correct answer is **C: Français standard buñuy jangale ci lekool yi** (They learn French standard in schools).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Teewul, Belge yi ak Suisse francophone yépp ñu ngi jàngee français standard ci daara yi..."" (Indeed, Belgians and French-speaking Swiss learn French standard in schools...). This directly addresses the question of what they do with the French language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Niñuy waxee baat yépp** (They speak the same things) - The passage discusses differences in numbering systems, indicating they *don't* speak exactly the same things.
* **B: Anam buñuy joxe nimero yi** (They don't like the numbers) - This isn't stated in the passage. The passage focuses on the *different* numbering systems.
* **D: Ni ñuy benn-bennalee baatu Français yi** (If they are all like the French) - The passage emphasizes that Belgians and Swiss have their own variations *different* from France.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kër yu yëngu xi wàllum biyee roplaan yi leen di digle ñoy Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa ngir wol yuy bawoo ci Etaa-Sini wala Kanadaa ak WestJet.""  This translates to ""The companies are looking for people to help customers book flights with Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for travel to the United States or Canada, and WestJet.""
* **The passage also states:** ""Ak lu meenti xéw, danga wara jap palas ci ropalaan bi ak téléfon."" This translates to ""And often, they need people to help with booking via phone.""
* **Option B** accurately reflects this - it talks about helping people find tickets and using customer service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sooy tukki ak WestJet:** The passage mentions WestJet, but doesn't suggest the *job* is specifically *flying* with WestJet.
* **C: Sooy tukki ak Lufthansa bawoo Paris ngir dem Etats-Unis:** This is a specific flight detail not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Sooy tukki ci Delta:**  Similar to A, it focuses on flying *with* Delta, not *helping others* book flights.



"
Lan moo dëggu ci njëgi déj yi?,"The correct answer is **D: Dañ leen wara japp ci kër guy jaay tiketu roplaan ci telefon.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ak lu meenti xéw, danga wara jap palas ci ropalaan bi ak téléfon."" This translates to ""And if you prefer, you can call to make your flight reservations by telephone.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dañuy fey njëgu tukki déj bi:** This translates to ""They don't have breakfast on the flights."" This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Dañoo wara jàpp palaas ci saasi ci ab daluwebu kër guy jaay ay tiketu tukki:** This translates to ""You can't book flights online or through a travel agency.""  The text mentions booking with airlines (Air Canada, Delta, etc.) and doesn't say online booking is impossible.
*   **C: Dañuy fay jêggu tukki yu jamp yi:** This translates to ""They don't have large flights."" This isn't mentioned in the text.

Kañ la jëfandikoo ab jëfandaayu GPS bu moom-boppam nara doon lu gëna neexa jëfandikoo ab jëfekaayu xuus ci GPS?,"The correct answer is **B: Sula wooré ni am nga connexion de données** (You need to have a data connection).

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) describes problems with GPS on a phone.** It mentions issues with finding a location, and the question (Q) asks about what's needed for GPS to work.
* **GPS relies on a data connection (either cellular data or Wi-Fi) to download map data and pinpoint your location.** Without a data connection, the GPS receiver can *receive* signals from satellites, but it can't translate those signals into a usable location on a map.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sooy jéema sakkanal xaalis (You need a SIM card):** While a SIM card is often *used* with phones that have GPS, it's the data connection associated with the SIM (or Wi-Fi) that's crucial, not the SIM card itself.
* **C: So nekke fuñ ladul mena jot (It's because the phone is old):**  An old phone *could* have a less accurate GPS, but a data connection is still required.
* **D: Soo bëgg luwe ab jëfandaay (You need to buy a GPS app):** Many GPS functions are built into the phone's operating system. While some apps offer more features, a basic GPS doesn't necessarily require a separate app purchase.



"
Lan moo nekkul luy waral ñuy jëfandikoo ab jëfekaayu GPS te wuutek ab jumtukaay bu moom-boppam?,"The correct answer is **A: Baña lu la jaaxal ci connexion de données** (It depends on having a data connection).

Here's why:

* **The original text (P) describes a problem with GPS not working on a phone.** The user is asking about whether a SIM card with data, a GPS module, or a car's built-in GPS is the solution.
* **GPS relies on data to function.** While the phone has a GPS *receiver*, it needs a data connection (either through a SIM card with data, or Wi-Fi) to download map data and accurately pinpoint location. Without that data connection, the GPS receiver can't provide useful information.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Sakkanal xaalis (SIM card is sufficient)** - A SIM card *with data* is important, but simply having a SIM card isn't enough.
    * **C: Moytu luwaas yi (Different models)** -  The model of the phone isn't the primary issue. The problem is the lack of data.
    * **D: Baña soxla jaay ay kart yu bees (It needs a specific SIM card)** - It's not about a *specific* SIM card, but about a SIM card *with data*.

Therefore, the most accurate response to the question (Q) is that the functionality of GPS depends on having a data connection.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan nga mënee garanti ni dañ la seexal ak bato bu baax?","The correct answer is **B: Jàpp palaas ci jamonoy basse saison**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nit yu bari dañuy jàpp seen palaas bu yagg (ndax bato yi dañuy faral di fees ci sezon bu mag bi).""  This translates to ""The birds often go looking for food (because the insects are plentiful in the rainy season).""  

Therefore, the passage indicates the birds actively search for food *during* the rainy season (basse saison - low season).  The other options aren't directly supported by the text:

* **A:** Talks about expensive kilometers - not mentioned.
* **C:** Mentions houses, which aren't relevant to the birds' foraging behavior.
* **D:** Talks about booking in advance, which isn't discussed.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xêt bi, ban ci yile lañu dul jëfandikoo niki ab tactique ngir fexe ba kiliyaan jouer?","The correct answer is **D: Ñakkum montar**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly mentions ""Palanteer ak montar du fa am...""** (Palanteer and Montar are doing it...).  This directly links Montar to the actions described - assisting casinos with understanding and manipulating player behavior.
* The passage describes casinos using data to predict and influence players (""ngir bégal seeni kliyaan ngir ñu baña dem feneen"" - to guide their clients to make them lose money). This is a manipulative tactic.
* The question (Q) asks about *tactics* used to manipulate players.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bariwaayu leeraay bu natirel (Natural language processing):** While potentially *used* in the overall process, it's not the core tactic being described.
* **B: Ay neexal yu mel ni ay tiketu concert yuñuy maye (Good ideas and ticket concerts):**  Completely irrelevant to the passage.
* **C: Ay naan yodul fay (Some useful days):**  Irrelevant and doesn't address the manipulative aspect.



Therefore, **Ñakkum montar (Montar's tactics)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la joueur bu muus wala moytu?","The correct answer is **A: Naan sangara bu bari**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes casinos as places where people lose money (""danuy def lunu mën ngir yokk waxtu ak xaalis bi"").**  It talks about the difficulties people face trying to win and how casinos benefit from these losses.
* **""Naan sangara bu bari"" translates to ""Big financial difficulties.""** This directly aligns with the theme of losing money and facing hardship within casinos.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nangu ay neexal (Some things are strange)** - While the passage hints at the manipulative nature of casinos, it doesn't primarily focus on strangeness.
* **C: Xool ay montaru saal ak ay montaru loxo (Schools of successful and unsuccessful strategies)** - The passage focuses on *losing* rather than strategy.
* **D: Amal ay laaj ci gennukaay bu gëna jege (Actions taken in a winning game)** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes; it speaks to success while the passage details failure.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xaaju wax lañu def ay araf yu mag ci diggu baatal bi?","The correct answer is **A: Werb**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) explicitly states: ""Lii yoon bu am solo la ngir **rañélé verbs yi ak objects yi**."" This translates to ""This is a tool to help identify verbs and objects.""  

The question (Q) asks what is being discussed in the text in relation to large numbers. The passage centers around identifying *verbs* (werb) and objects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tur:**  ""Tur"" means ""all"" or ""everything"" and isn't the focus of identifying things.
* **C: Melal:**  ""Melal"" means ""meaning"" and while important, isn't what the tool is *for*.
* **D: Adwerb:** ""Adwerb"" is a borrowing from the French ""adverbe"" (adverb) and is not discussed in the passage.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bii, lan la def afarab bu mag ci tur bi gëna jafe?","The correct answer is **B: Raññaatle ci werb yi** (Understanding verbs).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** explicitly states: ""Lii yoon bu am solo la ngir **rañélé verbs yi ak objects yi**."" This translates to ""This is a good exercise for **understanding verbs and objects**.""
* The passage describes a process of learning and practice relating to verbs and how they function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jang:**  ""Jang"" means ""error"" or ""mistake."" The passage isn't *about* making errors, but learning.
* **C: Bind:** ""Bind"" doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
* **D: Raññaatle ci yëf yi:** ""Understanding nouns"" - while nouns are important in language, the passage *specifically* focuses on verbs.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that directly reflects the main point of the passage."
"Ci dëkku àll yu Malaisie, ban geste mooy tekki “kaay”?","The correct answer is **A: Lem baaraamu joxoñukaay bi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ci Malaisie, manaam ci Malais yi dëkke ci dëkki àll yi, loolu mooy tekki « kaay », **mooy nuroo ak baaraamu joxoñ buñ lem mu jublu ci yaram wi**...""

This directly translates to: ""...in Malaysia, when Malays greet each other, they say 'kaay', **which is a form of respectful greeting that is common in their culture**...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Talal loxo:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Def High-five:** While the passage mentions similarities to other greetings, it doesn't equate ""kaay"" to a high-five.
*   **D: yëkëti baaram bu gàtt bi ci kaw:** This doesn't align with the description of ""kaay"" as a respectful greeting.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban geste moo wara tekki “dellusil”?","The correct answer is **A: Yëngal diggu loxo bi turne ko mu jëm ci biir**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a Malaysian custom called ""kaay"" which involves offering food (specifically, leftovers) to spirits. The phrase ""nanga def"" refers to spirits.  The text states this is done to appease the spirits so they don't bother people.  ""Yëngal diggu loxo bi turne ko mu jëm ci biir"" translates to ""Offerings of leftover food are given to them to eat,"" directly relating to the practice of feeding spirits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Baŋk ab baaraam:** This means ""bank and wealth"" and is unrelated to the passage's content.
*   **C: Yëngal sa diggu loxo turné ko mu jëm ginaaw:** ""Ginaaw"" means ""ground"" - offering food *on the ground* isn’t specifically described in the passage.
*   **D: Yëngal bopp:** ""Yëngal bopp"" means ""offerings in general"" and is too broad; the passage focuses on *what* is offered (leftovers) and *to whom* (spirits).



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo waral ay dagg-dagg ci yaram?","The correct answer is **B: Defukaay galaas yu teeyul** (Melting of glaciers).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly discusses glaciers melting.** It describes the noise of the ice breaking (""Galaas gi taxawul""), the resulting cracks and crevasses (""ay xarxar, ay kamb""), and the water flowing from the melting ice (""daanu ci suuf té xeeyna teeb wala beereegu ci wét gi"").  The passage emphasizes the *effect* of the melting - the changes to the landscape and the amount of water.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pont wu neige (Snowfall):** The passage focuses on *melting* ice, not new snowfall.
* **C: Daanug ay jali galaas (Flooding of icy areas):** While melting glaciers *can* contribute to flooding, the passage doesn't primarily focus on the flooding itself, but on the *process* of melting.
* **D: Bolok yu yaatu (Falling rocks):** The passage mentions cracks in the ice, but doesn't focus on falling rocks.

**The question (Q) asks for what is happening in the text.**  The text is clearly about the melting of glaciers.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile la pont wu neige yi mëna nëbb?","The correct answer is **A: Ay xar-xar**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Li day indi ay xarxar, ay kamb, yunu mënul gis ndax pongu niis yi.""  This translates to ""It contains sands, clays, and various minerals because of the numerous rocks.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What is found in it, which causes the snow to melt faster?
* The passage directly links the *xar-xar* (sands) to the melting of the glaciers and the changing environment.  The sands darken the surface, absorbing more heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay jali galaas** (Galaas stones) - While galaas is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically say they cause faster melting.
* **C: Ay miir** (Lakes) - Lakes are a *result* of the melting, not the cause.
* **D: Téere yu yaatu** (Tall trees) - Trees are not mentioned in the passage and are irrelevant to the context of glacial melt.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, wey-tukki yi dañoo wara waajal seen bopp laata ñuy dem ci ban barab?","The correct answer is **B: Barab yi wër Goma** (The cities around Goma).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Goma doon na barab bu wóor te am kaaraange, waaye bépp boo bëgga dem te bokkul ci Goma dañu ko wara saytu ngir xam ndax xeex bi ci Nord-Kivu amna fa a déet."" This translates to ""Goma has important cities and infrastructure, but many people fled and came to Goma to find safety because the situation in North-Kivu is dangerous.""

This directly indicates that people from surrounding cities came *to* Goma due to the dangerous situation, making ""cities around Goma"" the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Volcan bu Nyiragongo (Nyiragongo Volcano):** While the volcano is mentioned as a cause of past issues, the text focuses on people fleeing *from* cities, not the volcano itself.
*   **C: Kapitaal bi (The Capital):** The text doesn't discuss the capital city of the DRC.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is mentioned as a neighboring country, but the text doesn't say people are fleeing *from* Rwanda.



"
Ban ci yile moo warul doon ab tektak bu baax ngir ab turist ci Goma?,"The correct answer is **C: Taxis -moto yi anam yu baax lañu ngir dem ak dikk**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions ""boda-boda (Motorcycle taksi)"" as a good way to get around Goma.** It even gives a price example (""doxontu bu jadu si dëkk bi mingi xawa tollu ci 500 fr bu kongo"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xeey yi ci North Kivu dañoo neex:** While the passage mentions instability in North Kivu, it doesn't present this *as* a benefit for tourists. It's a reason people might be hesitant to visit.
* **B: Barab bu baax la ngir xool ay Gorille wu montaañ:** The passage mentions gorilla trekking, but doesn't say it's easily accessible or a major draw *within Goma itself*. It's a separate activity nearby.
* **D: Suufu volcan Nyiragongo mu ngi feete ci biir dëkk bi:** The passage mentions the volcano, but states it *destroyed* part of the city in 2002.  It's a point of interest, but not a positive aspect of being *in* Goma.



"
Kañ la ab permis ginaaw reew ngir ab bisu tambali ci Ut di jàppandi?,"The correct answer is **C: 1 fan ci Mé (1st of May)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Benn nangul réew ngir bénn bésu ndoortéle ci May yémbna ci 1 Jan.""  This translates to ""The deadline to apply for permits for camping is May 1st.""

Therefore, the answer is May 1st."
Ban polotik lañu teg ngir àar canyon bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ab sistemu permis njëkka ñëw njëkka am**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Permi yi am bariwul te nu denc leen ngir laaj yu amul rendez vous jàppandi ngir ku njëkka ñëw njëkka am.""  This translates to ""Permits are required and we need them for future trips planned for a first-come, first-served basis."" This directly refers to a single permit system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Permis yi 1 fan ci Samwiyee lañuy jàppandi:** The passage doesn't mention a specific day (Samwiyee/Saturday) for obtaining permits.
* **C: Ci ay càkkutéef yu soxlawul rendez-vous lañu mêna amee permis:** While rendezvous points are mentioned, the passage doesn't say they *grant* permits.  They are places to *use* permits you've already obtained.
* **D: Limu permis yu yemamaay:** The passage states permits *are* required, not that they are limited or unavailable.



"
Ban ci mbir yii mooy buñu gaawul mëna gis ci xeetu otel buñu xamle ci xët bi?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeneen gan yuñu xam bu baax wala ñu yomba raññee** (Elegant guests who are well-known or very rich).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a luxurious hotel (""yenn hôtel yii ngi deñc ba tay ndono jamono ju neex ja"") during its ""golden age.""**  It caters to a discerning clientele (""bato saxaar"").
* **It mentions the hotel hosting notable figures (""coliin bu yàgg yi, ñàkkum neexal yu mujj yi"").**  These are people of importance and likely wealth.
* **The mention of airplanes bringing guests (""neexee jël avion dem fu ko neex ci àdduna bi"") suggests travel and a clientele able to afford it.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ab baaru cocktail** - While a hotel might *have* a cocktail bar, it doesn't define the *type* of clientele.
* **B: Ab restoran gourment ci barab bi** -  A gourmet restaurant is a feature, not the core description of the guests.
* **D: Néeg yuñu yeesal bu yagul dara ak ay yeesal yu bees** - This translates to ""people who are very beautiful with many servants,"" which isn't the primary focus of the description.  The passage emphasizes status and prominence, not just beauty.



Therefore, option C best captures the essence of the clientele described in the passage – elegant, wealthy, and likely famous guests."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xibar yuñu joxe ci xët bi, ban ci yile neexal la otel bi di gëna ñakka wara jox priorité?","The correct answer is **A: Meuble yu yàgg ci barab bi yépp** (Luxurious furniture in all the rooms).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Otel yii ñoo ngi woon fi ñi am alal yi te siiw yi wara nekk, te difa reeree tek ci difa paase seeni guddi."" This translates to ""This hotel was known for its elegant and comfortable rooms, and attention was paid to the decoration of each room.""  This directly points to the quality and luxury of the furniture as a key characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ab restora bu am togkat bu aay** (A restaurant with high-quality service) - While a good restaurant is desirable, the text doesn't emphasize it as a *priority* or defining feature.
* **C: Ab salon buy def ay animations ci guddi** (A lounge offering entertainment daily) -  The text doesn't mention entertainment.
* **D: Ay njëgi néeg yu yomb** (Welcoming staff) - While good service is implied, the text focuses on the *physical* aspects of the hotel's appeal (elegance, comfort, decoration).

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la wey-tukki yu bëgga dem Greenland wara moytu?","The correct answer is **B: Indi ay yere yu diis ndax climat bi dafay faral du tang ci at mi yépp.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Soo demee Greenland ci jamono seddaay bi (di bàyyi xel ni loo gëna dem ci bët gannaar, mu gëna sedd), dafa am solo nga yóbb yere yu diis.""  This translates to: ""Recently, Greenland has been experiencing solo and many strange weather events (which are difficult to understand, they are changing), and there are many unusual weather events.""
* **The passage also mentions:**  The melting of Greenland due to warming temperatures (""Greenland dafa lonku bu baax ci 93 ci téemeer boo jël ci askan wi mëna jot ci internet.""). This directly links to climate change and its effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yenn barab yuñu xamee ci dayoob reyaate gu bari:** While the passage touches on the history of naming, it doesn't present this as a major reason people are moving to Greenland.
* **C: Yaakaar liggéey foofu, ndax connexion internet bi mën ñakka yem:** The passage *mentions* internet access is poor, but it doesn't say this is the primary reason for movement.
* **D: Royu ci ab doomu réewy Greenland niki ab “Eskimo”:**  The passage discusses the problematic term ""Eskimo"" but not as a driver of people moving *to* Greenland.



"
"Sunu sukkandiko ci xët bi, ban cu yile moo wara nekk luy waral ay jafe-jafe ngir wey-tukki yuy dem Greeland?","The correct answer is **A: Ay yoo yu Nordique**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci beer gi, meeytul tamit yoo wu Nordic yi."" which translates to ""In the past, people came from the Nordic countries.""  This directly links the origins of people in Greenland to the Nordic countries, and therefore their language/culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kirim:** The text doesn't mention Kirim (Crimea).
*   **C: Jawwu:** The text doesn't mention Jawwu.
*   **D: Waa foofu:** The text doesn't mention ""Waa foofu"" or any equivalent.



"
Ban ci yile lañuy jëfandikoo léegi ci plaza central?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Léegi dafay dox niki santaral plaza..."" which translates to ""It is located next to the central plaza..."" and then immediately identifies ""Jardín de la Unión"" as the place being discussed.  The question asks what is located *in* the central plaza, and the text directly links the Jardín de la Unión to being next to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: The Alley of the Kiss (Callejon del Beso):** While mentioned, it's described as a *part* of the Jardín de la Unión, not something *in* the central plaza itself.
*   **C: Templo de San Diego:** The text states it's near the plaza (""tabax benn bi ci des"") but doesn't say it *is* in the plaza.
*   **D: Callejon del Beso:** Same as B - it's a feature *within* the Jardín de la Unión.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yule moo amul ci Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Ab pavillon central ak ay concerts**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...ay konseer yu amul fay bi joge ci santaraal Gazebo."" (there are concerts held in the central Gazebo) and mentions a ""santral plaza"" which implies a central pavilion or area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Këru jaar-jaar bu yagg:** While the text mentions a narrow street (""Callejon del Beso"") known for its closeness, it doesn't specifically describe it as ""narrow streets"".
* **C: Ay Restoran yu nekk ci wetu sardeŋ bi:** The text mentions restaurants (""Amna ay restoran..."") but doesn't specify they are *around the sardine side* (wetu sardeŋ bi) - this is a misinterpretation.
* **D: Ab tabax bu yagg bu teggu ci ay sàrt:** The text describes a beautiful building, but doesn't mention it being *tall buildings on the sides* (tabax bu yagg bu teggu ci ay sàrt).



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban cu yile wax yu ci ab randonnée benn bis lañu mêna jàppee niki lu jubadi?","The correct answer is **A: Tuuti waajal lañu soxla ngir ay randonnée ci ay sentiers yu yomb.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Doxantu benn bés ci ab yoon bu yomb tuuti waajtaay la laaj..."" (The guide offers a long walk on beautiful paths). This directly links the guide to offering walks/hikes (randonnée) on scenic trails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Soriwaay yi dañuy wuute, waaye dañ leen wara muur ci benn fan:**  This translates to ""Some people are tired, but they don't want to rest on a bench.""  The passage doesn't mention tiredness or benches.
* **C: Nit yu am ab forme physique bu yemamaay dañuy faral di mëna def activité bii:** This means ""People with good physical condition can easily do the activity.""  While potentially true for hiking, it's not a direct statement *from* the passage.
* **D: Randonnée bis nekkul ab activité buñu wara def ci diggu bis bëcëg ak ay liir:** This translates to ""Hiking is a good activity to do with friends and family."" Again, potentially true, but not directly stated in the provided text.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that directly reflects information given in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la ab randonnée wu bis di laajee waajal bu yemamaay?","The correct answer is **B: Su nekkee ab sentier bu yomb**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Doxantu benn bés ci ab yoon bu yomb tuuti waajtaay la laaj..."" which translates to ""The hiker went on a long, winding path.""  ""Ab sentier bu yomb"" means a winding path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Su kiy def randonnée bi amee forme physique bu baax** (It requires good physical condition to hike) - While likely true, the passage doesn't focus on the *requirement* of physical fitness.
* **C: Su xale yi nekkee di dem defi am randonnée** (People like to challenge themselves with hiking) -  The passage doesn’t mention challenges or people’s motivations.
* **D: Sudee randonnée bi dafa nekk ci barab bu gëna natirel** (The hike is located in a beautiful natural area) - The passage implies beauty (""gëna tuuti""), but doesn't specifically state *where* it is.



"
Ci nan la plateaux yu nekk Rogaland wala Agder wuutee ak li ds ci Norvège?,"The correct answer is **A: Dañoo am ay garab** (There are mountains).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P)** explicitly states that in Rogaland and Agder, people greet each other with ""hei"" (hi) *because of the high mountains*. It mentions ""b suuf su aaml garab tee yenn saay ay kawu xët wër ko"" - which translates to ""on the high mountains that hide the sun for a long time."" This directly links the region to mountains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amul ay fjord:** While Norway *is* known for fjords, the passage focuses specifically on the mountainous regions of Rogaland and Agder.  It doesn't emphasize fjords in those areas.
* **C: Plateaux dañu tolloo li ci ëpp:** The text doesn't talk about plateaus being particularly high.
* **D: Ay bruyère ñoo leen di faral di muur:** The passage doesn't mention heather (bruyère) or moorland (muur).



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the text."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, yan ci yii ñoo dul nekk bawoo Norvège?","The correct answer is **A: Ay suuf yu yaatu te ubbeeku** (Tall and steep mountains).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Mandaargay Norwees mooy dafa am fjords ak dex yu bari doj yiy jékki rekk joxé ci ay suuf yu kawé."" which translates to ""Norwegian landscapes are characterized by fjords and large areas mostly located on tall mountains.""
* It also mentions mountains in the context of greetings (""vidde"" and ""hei""), further emphasizing their presence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay plateaux wu àll (High plateaus):** The passage doesn't focus on plateaus.
* **C: Ay fjords yuñu rëdd (Deep fjords):** While fjords *are* mentioned, the passage emphasizes they are *on* the mountains, not the main feature being described.  The question asks about the landscape *in general*.
* **D: Ay landes (Heathlands):** The passage doesn't mention heathlands.



Therefore, the best answer, based on the information provided in the passage, is **A**."
Kañ la touriste yu bëgg ski wara dem ci station montaañ yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci jamonoy été wu indien**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...gën gaa bari dañuy dem ba été indien."" ( ...they often go there during Indian summer.) and ""...baax c wergu yaram te d joxe ay jëf jëf yu melni ski ak snowboard."" (...it's a good place to enjoy skiing and snowboarding). 

Therefore, tourists who like to ski go to the mountain resorts during Indian summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci jamonoy séddaay (During the rainy season):** The passage mentions the rainy season as a time when it's not good for tourism.
* **B: Ci jamonoy haute saison (During the high season):** The passage doesn't specifically mention a high season, but focuses on Indian summer.
* **D: Ci jamonoy printemps (During the spring):** The passage doesn't mention spring.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la tourist yi di gëna bari ci station montaañ yi?","The correct answer is **A: Ci jamonoy neige yu bari yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...am nanu xeeti rafetaay yu bokkul ci jamono seddaay gi..."" (they have many lifts on the snowy slopes...) and ""...ay jëf jëf yu melni ski ak snowboard"" (many people practice ski and snowboard). This clearly indicates the tourists are going to ski resorts with snow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci jampnoy neige bi yépp:** While it mentions snow, it's too vague (""the other snowy slopes""). The passage focuses on *these* slopes.
* **C: Ci jamonoy été bu Ind:** ""Été indien"" (Indian summer) refers to a warm, late-season period, not a snowy one. The passage contrasts the warm Indian summer with the snowy slopes.
* **D: Ci weeri jamonoy sédd yépp:** This translates to ""the other quiet slopes"" which isn't mentioned in the text.



"
Lan nga wara moytu def so yaakaare gis ab bato buy sakku ndimbal?,"The correct answer is **B: Xaritoo ak capitaine yi** (Sailors and captains).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes people who work at sea - sailors and captains.** It talks about those who ""live on the sea,"" who ""guide their ships,"" who ""fish,"" and who ""deal with the hardships of the sea.""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Yeeg ak wàcc ci quais yi (Traders and those working on the docks):** While docks are *related* to the sea, the passage focuses on those *on* the sea, not those on land facilitating trade.
    * **C: Siiwal say sàrwiis (Civil/Public Service):** This has no connection to the passage.
    * **D: Baña bayyi xel ci ñiy def auto-stop (People who hitchhike):** This is completely unrelated to the description of seafaring life.

**The question (Q) asks what kind of people the passage is about.**  The passage clearly describes sailors and captains. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.



"
Lan nga wara def ci manines ci sooy set ab bato bu soxla ndimbal?,"The correct answer is **A: Jokkoo ak feeykat yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes people who are very rich and powerful.** They have many servants, large houses, and luxurious lifestyles. They are also described as exploiting others.
* **Option A, ""Jokkoo ak feeykat yi"" (Wealth and possessions)** directly reflects this description of the people in the passage.  The passage focuses on *what* these people *have*.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Nekk ci suuf radaar bi (Being on a radar screen)** - This doesn't connect to the description in the text.
    * **C: Jefe nit ñu kese suñuy nettoyer seen yacht (Bosses who have people clean their yacht)** - While this *could* be a detail of their lives, it's too specific and doesn't encompass the broader picture of wealth and power.
    * **D: Moytu yeneen auto-stoppeurs (Picking up hitchhikers)** - This is completely unrelated to the passage.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because it represents the central theme of the passage - the lives of the wealthy and privileged."
Ban barab la ab touriste wara bëgg ci jaar-jaaru colonial bu duuni bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Pooru Victoria**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""Pooru Victoria feeñal"" (Victoria Harbour) as a prominent feature and a place tourists frequently visit. It's described as offering a beautiful view and being a key part of the Hong Kong experience. The passage also links it to the history of Hong Kong and its colonial past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tefesu bëj-ganaar:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Front de mer bu Kowloon:** While Kowloon is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically highlight its waterfront as a key tourist attraction tied to colonial history.
*   **C: Biir ville bu Hong Kong:** This is too general. The passage focuses on a specific landmark.



"
Ban barab mooy nara neexab touriste buy jiitël gis yu raget yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Duunu Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Duni Hong Kong yi ñoo jox bërëbu Hong Kong turam te nekk bërëb bui tukkikat yu bari taamu."" This translates to ""Hong Kong's scenery is known for its beautiful harbor and many islands.""  The passage then goes on to describe the Victoria Harbour and Kowloon waterfront.
* **The question asks:** ""What is a major attraction for tourists and a beautiful scenery?""
* **Duunu Hong Kong (Hong Kong's scenery/landscape)** directly addresses this, as the passage establishes it as a key feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pooru Victoria (Victoria Harbour):** While important, it's *part* of the scenery, not the overall scenery itself.
* **B: Hong Kong ci boppam (Hong Kong in general):** Too broad. The question asks for a *specific* attraction.
* **D: Front de mer bu Kowloon (Kowloon waterfront):** Again, a specific part of the scenery, not the overarching attraction.



"
Lan la yenn selle yi am ngir jappale ci waññi risku tanki kiy war fas bi keppu ci ab étrier?,"The correct answer is **B: Baaru kaarànge yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...rawatina selles yu Angale yi, dañoo am ay baaru kaarànge yuy tax etriyee daanu ci selle bi suko ab warkat buy xëccee ci ginnaaw.""  This translates to ""...they have English saddles, which have bars that are very effective for reducing risk in the stirrups.""

The question asks what the saddles have to help with risk in the stirrups. The passage *directly* states the ""baaru kaarànge"" (bars) are for that purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Semelles yu sew (Sew soles):** The passage mentions sew soles, but not in relation to reducing stirrup risk.
*   **C: Etrier yuñu defaree ak der (Stirrups that are different and leather):**  The passage mentions stirrups, but focuses on what *helps* with them, not the stirrups themselves.
*   **D: Dal bu gëna bari (A heavy cloth):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Ban xeetu botu dawalukaay fas mooy jàppale ci yokk kaaràngey dawalkatu fas bi biñuy jëfandikoo ab étrier?,"The correct answer is **A: Ab semelle bu dëgër te sew**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes issues with shoe soles (""dawalkat"").** It talks about them wearing out quickly, being unstable, and needing to be replaced.
* **It specifically mentions ""rawatina selles yu Angale yi"" (English soles) being better quality and lasting longer.**  This implies the current soles are *not* good quality.
* **""Ab semelle bu dëgër te sew"" translates to ""a sole that is weak and quickly wears out.""** This directly reflects the problems described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Der:** Just means ""yes"" and isn't related to the question.
* **C: Ab talon:** Refers to the heel of a shoe, not the entire sole.
* **D: Semelle bu yaatu:** Means ""a durable sole,"" the opposite of the problem described in the text.



"
Lan lañuy jox ñiy tukki ci réseau joxante teranga yi?,"The correct answer is **D: Lëkkaloo ak yeneen wey-tukki yuy dem ci benn barab bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soo bëggee bokk ci réseau bu ni mel, dangay joxe leeral yi war ci formulaire bi ci net bi; waaye nak yeneen reseau yi dañu laay laaj yeneen xeetu saytu ci ki nga doon."" This translates to ""So many people use online networks, they easily find offers on forms online; but these networks don't always offer the experience people want."" This implies people are looking for connections and experiences *with* locals, not just tours or guides.
* **The passage then introduces Couchsurfing:** a platform built on the idea of connecting travelers with locals for lodging and cultural exchange (""Limum njaatige yu jàppandi yi joxe nanu ko ci ab keyt wal ci lëndd gi te yeneen tukkikat yi xoolaat nanu leen."").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jiox leen ay dëkkuwaay ci ay dalalkat yi ci dëkk bi** (Finding accommodations in different locations in the city) - While finding accommodation is *part* of the experience, the passage emphasizes the connection with people.
* **B: vol yu yomb** (Cheap flights) - The passage doesn't mention flights at all.
* **C: Tours yu guide yi ci dëkk bi di joxe** (Guided tours in the city) - Guided tours are a more formal, less personal experience than what the passage describes.



Therefore, **D** best captures the idea of connecting with locals for a more authentic experience, which is the core message of the text regarding online networks and platforms like Couchsurfing."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax yu aju ci reseau joxante terangayi mo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **B: Yenn reseau mën nañ laaj ñu amal yeneeni saytu ci wey-tukki yi** (Some networks don't allow you to share your site on them).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Soo bëggee bokk ci réseau bu ni mel, dangay joxe leeral yi war ci formulaire bi ci net bi; waaye nak yeneen reseau yi dañu laay laaj yeneen xeetu saytu ci ki nga doon.""  This directly translates to: ""Many are active on social networks, easily sharing links on online forms; but some networks don't allow you to share any sites on them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the text mentions difficulty sharing links, it doesn't focus on *why* people travel.
* **C:** The text says individuals *can* find accommodation, but doesn't state they specifically *use* way-tukki for that purpose.  It's about the broader problem of sharing links.
* **D:** The text doesn't suggest difficulties in *finding* accommodation through way-tukki, but in *promoting* it on certain networks.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci bi, ban xeetu gan moo wara ci ab xeetu néeg buñu bokk?","The correct answer is **A: Ab gan bi ñuy sooga dugg ci fukki at yi.**

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) discusses a hotel (otel) that is full (tonuna) and doesn't have enough rooms (seen) to accommodate guests.** It mentions people being turned away (wanté mënno gis tukkikat) because of a lack of space.
* **Q (the question) asks about the reason people are being turned away.**
* **Option A (""This reason is often found in hotels"") directly addresses the issue of hotels being full and unable to take more guests.** The passage explicitly describes this situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ab gan buy tukki moom kese** - This translates to ""This reason is that it's expensive,"" which isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Ab gan buy tukki ak ay xale yu ndaw** - This translates to ""This reason is that there are few rooms,"" but the passage focuses on *fullness* rather than simply a small number of rooms.
* **D: Ab gan bu nekk ci ay fauweeri atam** - This translates to ""This reason is that it's in a bad location,"" which isn't mentioned.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo wara dëkk ci ab otel?","The correct answer is **B: Ñetti ndaw yu am 22 at ak ñaar yu and di tukki**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) describes a hotel with many rooms (ñi-gàan bu set moo ngi ci seeni ñaar fukki).** It mentions families staying there (""ñaar yu and di tukki"").  It also implies a significant number of rooms (""22 at"" - roughly translating to ""22 and more"") could be a reasonable estimate given the description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jëkër ak jabar yuy tukki ak ab liir buy sooga juddu** - This translates to ""Individuals and couples stay with a little money to spend.""  While possible, the passage doesn't *focus* on the clientele's financial status.
* **C: Jëkër ak jabar yu toll ci seen 70 at** -  ""Individuals and couples total around 70.""  This doesn't align with the passage's description of *rooms*, not people.
* **D: Ñaari famille yuy tukki ak seni doom** - ""Many families stay with two people.""  The passage mentions families, but doesn't specify the number of people per family.



Therefore, option B is the most direct answer to the question, based on the information provided in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax mooy leeral bu baax ndortelu boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Dina dellusi sa loxo sa su nekk so sannee bu baax**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""So bëggee jàng nuñuy sànnee ab boomerang buy dellu ci sa loxo, fexel ba am ab boomrang bu baax ngir mu delli."" This translates to: ""They sell many boomerangs to tourists, especially good ones for throwing.""  This directly relates to the idea of good quality boomerangs being available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moo gëna siiw ci ñi fa dëkk kë touriste yu ci dëkk bi** -  While the passage mentions tourists, it doesn't say anything about *finding* tourists in the shop.
* **C: Amul ay boomerangs yu bari yu jàppandi ci Australie** - The passage mentions boomerangs originate in Australia, but doesn't say they are *many* large, beautiful ones.
* **D: Yenn boomerangs yi kese ñoo mëna ñëwaat** - The passage doesn't discuss how long boomerangs last, just that they are good for throwing.



"
Ban ci yile lañuy faral di jëfandikoo ci waññu javanaise yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Suukëru koko**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically mentions ""**suukar (rawatina suukaru koko Javanese)**"" as a food item enjoyed by the Javanese.  ""Suukëru koko"" is a direct reference to this Javanese sugar/sweet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Suukër su weex:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Suukër su mokk:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: SuukPer suñuy seggul:** This isn't mentioned in the passage and seems like a nonsensical combination.

The question (Q) asks about a food item used by the Javanese, and the passage directly identifies *suukëru koko*.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan la feebar buy wàllé di lawee?","The correct answer is **B: Doomu jangoro yi** (Microorganisms).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fébar buy wallaaté mooy bu bénn pathogen indi, bu mélni ddoomu jangoro, bacterium, fungus wala yénééni xéét.""  This translates to: ""Febrile illness is often caused by a pathogen, mainly microorganisms, bacteria, fungi or viruses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nit yuñu wàll** (People who are sick) - People *have* the fever, they don't *cause* it.
* **C: Bakteri** (Bacteria) - Bacteria are *a type* of microorganism that can cause fever, but not the only one. The passage lists bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
* **D: Ñàkku yi** (Illnesses) - This is too general. Fever is a symptom of illness, not the cause.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, la lañu xamul nit dafay waral feebar buy wàllé?","The correct answer is **A: Ñàkku yi (Insects)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Féebar buy wallaaté mooy bu bénn pathogen indi, bu mélni **ddoomu jangoro**, bacterium, fungus wala yénééni xéét.""  This translates to: ""Febrile illnesses are often caused by a pathogen, most commonly **insects**, bacteria, fungi or viruses.""

Therefore, insects are listed as a common cause of febrile illnesses (feebar buy wallaaté) in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Doomu jangoro yi (Insects)** - While insects *are* mentioned, the question asks for what causes the fever, not just a category.
*   **C: Bakteri yi (Bacteria)** - Bacteria are *a* cause, but not the *most common* according to the text.
*   **D: Champignon (Fungi)** - Fungi are *a* cause, but not the *most common* according to the text.



"
Ci ban anam la tànn ab proxy Web ci kaw ab VPN personnel di doy ngir jëfandikukat bi?,"The correct answer is **B: Jëfandikukaat bi dafay xalaata moytu numu ko mëna censure wala espionage** (The benefit is that it helps to avoid censorship or espionage).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states the VPN is for avoiding political and commercial IP tracking.** This is directly related to avoiding censorship (political) and potentially corporate spying/tracking (commercial).
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Jëfandikukat dafay bëgg a jubalewaat jaabante yépp** (The benefit is that it improves speed) - The passage mentions traffic *slows down* when using a VPN, not improves.
    * **C: Jëfandikukaat bi dafay jubalewaat jaabante http ci njëlbéen** (The benefit is that it improves http traffic specifically) -  The passage doesn't focus on HTTP traffic specifically; it's a broader concern about all internet traffic.
    * **D: Liggéeyu jëfandikukat bi dafay laaj ab dayoo bande passante bu yem ba ci bu kawe** (Usually the benefit is a wider bandwidth than the standard) - The passage suggests the opposite - a potential slowdown.



Therefore, option B best reflects the primary benefit described in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax ci li àju ci VPN yi ak proxy web yi moo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **A: VPN yi dañuy faral di joxe bande passante bu gëna kawe proxy web yi** (VPNs generally offer a more secure and wider bandwidth than web proxies).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Joxekati VPN (réseau virtuel privé) yi anam yu baax lañu moytu séggu way-polotik yi ak séggu IP commercial yi. (VPNs are good for political and commercial IP security). This implies a stronger security feature.
* **The passage also states:**  Proxy web yi ci sabab yu bari: dañuy jàllewaat tarafiku internet yépp, yemu ñu ci http kese. (Web proxies have limitations: they only redirect internet traffic, often just for http).  This shows proxies are more basic and limited.
* **Bandwidth:** VPNs encrypt *all* your traffic, offering a more comprehensive and often faster (wider bandwidth) connection.  Proxies often have limitations on the types of traffic they handle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Proxy web yi mënu ñu jubalewaat jaabante web yi yépp (Web proxies don't usually block web content) - The passage doesn't specifically state this, and proxies *can* be used for content filtering.
* **C:** Proxy web yi baaxaayu sàrwiis bu neew lañu am suñ leen mengalee ak VPN yi (Web proxies are a better service because they have advantages over VPNs) -  The passage actually implies the opposite – VPNs are better for security.
* **D:** VPN yi jaabante http yi kese lañuy mëna jubalewaat (VPNs only redirect http traffic) - The passage states proxies are often limited to http.  VPNs encrypt *all* traffic.

The passage states the problem is about finding a way to make phone calls *using the internet* ( ""Liñuy jàllale woote yi jaare ko ci internet...""). The whole context revolves around alternatives to traditional phone lines because of difficulties with them.  The question asks what helps overcome the problem of making phone calls from remote areas. Internet-based calls are presented as the solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbooleem nimero telefon yi (All phone numbers):** Phone numbers are *part* of the problem, not the solution. The passage discusses the difficulty of getting and using phone numbers in remote areas.
* **C: Satellite yi (Satellites):** Satellites are mentioned as one technology used (in Alaska), but the overarching theme is using the internet as a broader solution.
* **D: Telefonu PSTN yi (PSTN phones):** PSTN phones are the *existing* system that is failing in these areas – they are the problem, not the solution.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañu wara def ngir jot ci yenn woote yi?","The correct answer is **A: Jënd ab nimero buñuy mëna woote fépp ci adduna** (They found a number that works everywhere in the world).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The person was looking for a number that could connect them to family, even with challenges like satellite connections in remote areas (Alaska, Arizona).  The ultimate goal was a number that *just works* regardless of location.
* **Option A** directly reflects this - a number that works *everywhere*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jëfandikoo ab nimero telefonu këru liggéeyukaay** (They found a phone number that is easy to remember) - The passage doesn't mention memorability.
* **C: Am ab nimero ci sa askan** (They have a number in their account) - This is too specific and not the main point.
* **D: Jënd ab telefonu PSTN** (They found a PSTN telephone) - While the passage mentions PSTN as a contrast, the goal wasn't *finding* a PSTN phone, but finding a number that works *instead of* relying solely on PSTN.

Ban ci yile moo dul xamle bu baax niñuy waxee baat yi ci Italien?,"The correct answer is **A: Niñ waxee double r dafa wuuteek niñuy waxe benn r**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the double ""r"" sound in Italian.** It explains how Italians pronounce ""r"" and specifically highlights the difference between a single ""r"" and a double ""rr"" (caro vs. carro).  The passage states ""Na nga fexe tamit wax r ak rr ci anam yu wute : caro mooy tekki , nanga wax bu btamitaax r mu outé ak rr: caro mooy tekki soppe, wante carro saret lay tekki."" This directly relates to the difficulty non-native speakers have with the double ""r"" sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baat yu bari dañ leen di waxee niñ leen bindee** - While the passage mentions difficulty with pronunciation, it doesn't focus *specifically* on long words.
* **C: Baat yu am arafu c ak g mën nañu doon lu jafe** - The passage *uses* words with ""c"" and ""g,"" but doesn't make that the central point of the discussion. It's about the ""r"" sound.
* **D: Ni ñuy waxee yenn baat yi dafay wuute ci yile voyelle** - The passage does mention vowels, but as it relates to *how* the ""r"" sound is pronounced (near the top of the mouth, affecting vowels), not as the main focus.



"
Ban ci yile melokaanu Izmir moo juddoo ci jamono yu bees yi?,"The correct answer is **A: Yoon yu yaatu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""**Yoon yu yaatu, batimaa yu bari ay ak ay centre commersio yu modern yuñ xaddee tuile yu xonk ni tabaxu cosaan...**"" which translates to ""Beautiful cities, with many modern shopping centers and luxurious hotels..."" This directly answers the question about what Izmir is known for in terms of tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tabax yu am verre ci seen kanam** - The text mentions hotels (""tabaxu cosaan"") but doesn't specifically highlight those *with sea views*.
*   **C: Barabi jëndukaay yu mag yi** - While the passage says it has beautiful streets, it doesn't focus on *large* streets.
*   **D: Mbaar yu am tuile yu xonq** - While it mentions tiled buildings, that isn't the primary focus of what Izmir is known for.



"
Ban ci yile moo nekkul ab melokaanu Izmir?,"The correct answer is **D: Moo am èaareelu port bi gëna mag ci Turkey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nekkoon ab dëkk bu yàgg bu Smyrna...am yokkute te bar idem ak ñëw, nu def ko mu wër peggu ndoox bu rëy te ay montaañ wër ko."" This translates to ""It was once the city of Smyrna...it has a port that is important for trade and mountains surround it.""  This directly points to Izmir being a major port city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dêkk bi dafay wër baie bu yaatu (The city is on a beautiful bay):** While likely true, the passage doesn't *emphasize* this as a defining characteristic.
* **B: Atmosphère dafay nirook Turque bu yagg ba (The atmosphere is very Turkish):**  The passage mentions history and a Mediterranean feel, but doesn't specifically focus on the *Turkishness* of the atmosphere.
* **C: Mën nga gis ab bitik yu bees ak ay jangu yu yagg (There are many shops and beautiful gardens):** The passage mentions commerce and historical buildings, but doesn't single out shops and gardens as key features.

Baatu hanami xoolandi wu lan lay juñju?,"The correct answer is **B: Aristokarasi bu Japon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ca Sapoŋ, feetu sëriis yu njëkk yi ci tóor-tóor ay ampërër ñoo leen di nos ngir seen bopp kese ak yeneen nit yu bokk ci nguur gi ci li wër imperiyaal bi.""  This translates to something like: ""Originally, the first cherry blossom viewers were powerful people who used them to show their status and with the people who lived in the imperial court.""

This directly links the *hanami* practice (cherry blossom viewing) to the Japanese aristocracy and the imperial court.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay tóor-tóoru sëriis** - This simply means ""cherry blossoms"" and doesn't explain *who* was initially involved in *hanami*.
*   **C: Ay tóor-tóori prunier** - The passage mentions plum blossoms in relation to China, but *hanami* is specifically about cherry blossoms in Japan.
*   **D: Li wër imperiyaal bi** - While the imperial court *was* involved, they weren't the sole initiators; it started with the powerful aristocracy as well.



"
Kan moo jitewoon soirée yu njëkk yuñu jagleloon saytu yenn tóorr-tóori sëriis yi?,"The correct answer is **B: Aristokrat yu Japon** (Japanese Aristocrats).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ca Sapoŋ, feetu sëriis yu njëkk yi ci tóor-tóor ay ampërër ñoo leen di nos ngir seen bopp kese ak yeneen nit yu bokk ci nguur gi ci li wër imperiyaal bi.""  This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewings were by powerful people who organized them for their well-being and the people who lived near the imperial court.""

This clearly indicates that *aristocrats* (powerful people near the court) in Japan were the first to enjoy cherry blossom viewing (hanami).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Empereur bu Chine (Emperor of China):** The passage mentions China briefly in relation to plum blossoms, but the focus of the hanami tradition is in Japan.
* **C: Empereur bu Japon (Emperor of Japan):** While the imperial court is mentioned, the passage specifically states it was *powerful people* organizing it, not solely the emperor.
* **D: Aristikarasi bu Chine (Aristocrats of China):** The passage doesn't connect Chinese aristocrats to the Japanese hanami tradition.

"Suu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mbiri Jerusalem mooy bi warul mëna xëcc touriste yi?","The correct answer is **D: Barabi istuwaar yu mag** (Many historical landmarks).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jerusalem mooy barab buuu turist gën ñëw ci Israel."" (Jerusalem is a major tourist attraction in Israel.) and further elaborates on its historical sites, religious significance, and vibrant city life (cafes, shops, etc.).  This directly points to the abundance of landmarks and attractions as the reason for its popularity with tourists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Solos diiney dëkk bi** (The city's only religion) - The passage explicitly states it's important to *multiple* religions, not just one.
* **B: Statut bumu am niki ak capitaal** (Its status is not clear as a capital) - While the passage mentions dispute over its capital status, this isn't the *reason* tourists visit.
* **C: Yimuy joxe ci wàllu cosaan** (It is situated in all kinds of things) - This is too vague and doesn't relate to tourism.



"
Ban ci yile lañu waxul ci xët bii niki luñu xamee Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **C: Li diine di tekki** (The religious significance).

Here's why:

* **The passage heavily emphasizes Jerusalem's importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.** It states it's holy to all three religions and a place of pilgrimage. This is the central theme regarding *why* Jerusalem is significant.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ituwaar bu doywaar (Detailed history):** While the passage mentions history, it doesn't focus *on* the detailed history as the core reason for its importance.
* **B: Influence polotik (Political influence):** The passage notes the political claim of Israel, but that's a *result* of the city's importance, not the reason *why* it's important to so many.
* **D: Barabi cosaan yi (Tourist attractions):** While tourism is mentioned, it's presented as a consequence of the city's other qualities, not the main point.

The text states: ""Mën na nekk tamit lu am njëriñ ngir kenn jënd ab Wild Card, buy joxe ay dug ngir yeneen tànneefu park ci Afrig du Sud wala Park nasyonal yi nekk ci Afrig du sud yepp.""  This translates to: ""It has a system to get a Wild Card, allowing access to many parks in South Africa or national parks in South Africa.""

This directly implies the Wild Card provides access to *multiple* parks, including Kruger National Park. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While SANParks manages Kruger, the Wild Card isn't *just* for SANParks - it's for a broader range of parks.
* **B:**  This is too limited. The Wild Card's benefit is access to *more than just* Kruger.
* **C:** The text doesn't mention budget; it focuses on access.



"
Ban wax moo dul xamle bu baax Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Mooy bi gëna tuuti ci Park National yu Afrique du Sud** (It is one of the most important parks in the National Parks of South Africa).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Benn la ci barab yi dàq ci Afrik di Sid te moom lañuy jappee niki darapo bu Park Nasiyonaal bu Afrik di Sid (SANParks).""  This translates to ""It is one of the most important parks in South Africa and is managed by South African National Parks (SANParks).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While it *is* in South Africa, the text focuses on its importance *within* the South African park system, not just its location.
* **B:** The text mentions ecozones, but doesn't state it's known *for* them. It highlights its diversity, but not specifically as a feature of ecozones.
* **D:**  The Wild Card is a way to *access* the park, not a defining characteristic *of* the park itself.



"
Ban ci yile moo gëna mëna wooradi ngir yéeg ci xaaj yu gëna ëpp askaliyee ci montaañ bi?,"The correct answer is **A: Anam yu tooy**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Amna bénn kamb gu xat ci kaw boxam mëna fa jaar, dafa ndaw lool té dancaloo."" which translates to ""...Some people brought a small box with them every year, they were very numerous and danced.""  This clearly refers to people (anam) who came (tooy) to participate in the activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eskaliyee wu xeer:** The passage mentions ""escaliers"" (stairs) but doesn't state they are special or important to the people coming.
* **C: Xeer yu ndaw:** While the passage says they were numerous, ""xeer yu ndaw"" (many things) doesn't specifically refer to *people*.
* **D: Ay fiilu asiyee:** The passage doesn't specifically mention ""fiilu asiyee"" (old stories/legends).

This translates to: ""They spoke about this for a while, they told them about their experiences and the difficulties of the journey, preparing them for what they would face, because the road is very difficult.""
* **""Xaaj yi gëna tàcc""** means ""the difficulties of the journey"" or ""the challenges along the way.""
* **""dañuy wooradi suñu tooyee""** means ""are very difficult to face.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeegkat yu sawar yi sax di nañu sonn:** This translates to ""The beautiful sights are what they remember."" While Machu Picchu *is* beautiful, the passage focuses on the *difficulty* of getting there.
* **B: Amul benn mains courantes ci xaaj yi gëna tàcc:** This translates to ""There are many springs along the way.""  The passage doesn't mention springs.
* **C: Da nga wara jeggi ab xeer ci kaw:** This translates to ""You can't just walk easily on it."" While true, it's not the *main* point the passage makes about the journey.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mo nekkul ab lekk bu Majorquain di gëna jëfandikoo ci seen togg?","The correct answer is **A: Yàpp**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Lekku Mayork, melni diwaan yi nekk ci Mediterane... ak yàpp (rawatina maam)..."" which translates to ""Majorcan cuisine, a diet located in the Mediterranean... and fruit (especially figs)...""
* **The question (Q) asks** about a key ingredient in Majorcan cuisine that's known for being plentiful.
* The passage emphasizes *yàpp* (fruit, specifically figs) as a prominent component.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mburu:** While mentioned, it's presented *with* the fruit, not as the defining plentiful ingredient.
* **C: Cereale:**  Cereals aren't highlighted in the passage.
* **D: Lejum:** (Vegetables) Also mentioned, but not as specifically highlighted as *yàpp*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Liy tàngal foos bi mën na bawoo ci ñaari mbir, mën na nekk xeeri daay yu tàng wala gox bi nekk barab yu am tàngooru geotermik."" This translates to: ""Some foods are cooked with stones, or with steam from areas with geothermal heat."" This directly relates to using geothermal areas for cooking, and the ""hangi géometrique"" (geothermal hangi) utilizes this.  It also mentions a search for suitable sites for this type of cooking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Wellington is mentioned as having hangi, the passage doesn't say anything about *finding* sites *in* Wellington.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention roti or people specifically togging (cooking) with them.
* **D:** The passage mentions Rotorua *has* hangi, but not that people are *searching for* geothermal hangi *in* Rotorua.



"
Ban ci yile lañu limul niki anam buñu gëna xam ci tangal ab teen?,"The correct answer is **B: Xeer yu tang** (Thermal waters).

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses ""dañuy togg Ñamu Hangi ci teen bu tàng ci suuf si"" which translates to ""hot water from Ñamu Hangi is used for cooking.""**  It then goes on to describe geothermal areas and *xeer* (waters) used for heating and cooking.
* The passage specifically mentions Rotorua being known for its *hangi sewotermik* (geothermal cooking) and describes waters used for geothermal energy.
* The question asks about what is used for cooking, and the passage clearly links the hot water/geothermal activity to cooking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gaz (Gas)** - While geothermal activity *can* produce gas, the passage focuses on the water itself.
* **C: Tangaayu géométrique (Geometric shapes)** - This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Xeer yu tang (Thermal waters)** - This is a duplicate of B and is also the correct answer.



"
Lan mooy mëna waral ab xamee bu xejjiku ci moine wala ab nonne?,"The correct answer is **C: Ab musoor ci monastère bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a scene within a monastery.** The text repeatedly refers to ""monasteer bi"" (the monastery) and details the lives and activities of people *within* that monastery (the jigéen, the way they dress, their routines).
* **The question asks about the general setting.**  It asks if the story takes place in a monastery or elsewhere.
* **Options A, B, and D are too specific or incorrect.**
    * A focuses on a specific detail (melo) not the overall setting.
    * B mentions ""muur mbagg"" (people and goods) which is *within* the setting but doesn't define it.
    * D is a generalized statement about people and doesn't pinpoint the location.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer, directly reflecting the context of the passage.



"
Ban ci yile yere mo jàppandiwul ngir ñu àbb ko ci monastère bi? ,"The correct answer is **C: Pantalon**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""goor yi denio war di solou pantalong bu mur om yii."" This translates to ""the children were all wearing dark colored pants.""  The question asks what the children were wearing when they arrived at the monastery. Therefore, the answer is pants (pantalon).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sipp:** This refers to a type of traditional Wolof hat, not clothing worn on the lower body.
*   **B: Kilot:** While *kilot* can mean shorts, the passage specifically mentions *pantalon* (pants).
*   **D: Musoor:** This refers to slippers or sandals, worn on the feet, not the main clothing item described.



"
Kan la ab visiteyr am sansu xool ay biddew suy de visité barabi Antarctique yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci weeru jamonoy sédd yi** (During the long dark winters).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Loolu dina doon mbir mu baax ci ñi bëgga gis li ñuy woowe aurores boréale..."" (This is most beautiful for those who go to see the Northern Lights...).  The Northern Lights (aurores boréale) are best seen in dark skies.
* **The passage also implies:** The passage discusses the polar regions and the conditions needed to see them, linking it to the darkness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci weeri été yi** (During the summers) - Summers have long daylight hours, making it impossible to see the auroras.
* **B: Su barab bi bariwul nit** (Because the ice is melting) - While climate change is mentioned, it doesn't directly relate to *when* to visit to see the lights.
* **D: Su dayoo polution leeraay bi waññeeko** (Because air pollution is decreasing) - Pollution affecting visibility isn't the primary factor for viewing the auroras.  Darkness is.



"
Kan la ñu mënul remplacer ab telefon satellite ak ab telefon portaabal?,"The correct answer is **A: Sudee dañoo wara nëbb liiñ yuñuy jëmale ci sattelite bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mën nañu ni ab téléphone satellite mënul wuutu ab téléphone portable, ndax fàww nga nekk ci biti, fu làquwul ci satellite ngir nga mën ci woote téléphone."" (It is true that satellite phones can replace mobile phones, because you need to be in a place with network coverage to use a mobile phone, but you only need to be looking at the satellite to use a satellite phone.) This directly addresses the question of whether satellite phones can replace mobile phones, highlighting their advantage in areas without network coverage.
* **Option A** translates to ""Indeed, they are currently working on improving signal quality with satellites."" This aligns with the idea that satellite technology is being developed to offer a viable alternative, especially where mobile networks are unavailable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sudee bari dafa sori lool:** (""Indeed, they are currently coming out a lot"") - This is too general and doesn't address the *replacement* aspect.
* **C: Sudee dañ koy jëfandikoo ci biti:** (""Indeed, they can find coverage in a place"") - This only restates part of the passage’s explanation *why* satellite phones can be used, not if they replace mobile phones.
* **D: Sudee ab expédition dafay laaj yenn données yuñu soxla:** (""Indeed, expeditions are sending a lot of useful data"") - This is about data transmission, not the replacement of phones.



"
Kañ la lañuy mëna tànn ab telefon sattelite bayyi fi ab telefon portaabal?,"The correct answer is **C: Sudee soxla wuñu ay données yu sori** (It requires sending a lot of data).

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that satellite phones need to connect to satellites.** This connection requires sending data *to* the satellite and receiving it back.  The passage contrasts this with mobile phones which connect to nearby towers.
* **The passage states satellite phones are useful where there's no mobile network.** This implies a need for a different, more complex connection (sending data to a satellite).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sooy dem wakans ci ab dëkk** (It needs to be woken up in a shop) - The passage doesn't mention anything about activation in a shop.
* **B: Sooy tukki ci bato** (It needs batteries) -  While all phones need power, this isn't the *key* difference highlighted in the passage.
* **D: Sooy melni kuy am couverture telefon portaabal bu baax** (It needs a very good mobile phone network) - This is the *opposite* of why you'd use a satellite phone - you use them where there *isn't* good mobile coverage.



"
Ab ñakka deggoo bi nga xamantane bii dafay waral ñu sos ab Republic transltionnel?,"The correct answer is **A: Koom**.

Here's why:

This translates to ""In 1994, an armed conflict began with the breakaway republic of Transnistria in Moldova, which has its own government and economic system, essentially a state within a state.""

The question asks *what* caused the conflict regarding the Transnistrian Republic. The passage clearly indicates it was a desire for **koom** (independence/breakaway status).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Waaso** (large/vast) - While Moldova is described as a relatively small country, this isn't the *cause* of the conflict.
*   **C: Lakk** (city) - Chișinău is the capital, but it doesn't explain the conflict with Transnistria.
*   **D: Diine** (religion) - Religion is mentioned as a characteristic of Moldova, but not the root cause of the conflict.



"
Ban ci yile da République bu Transnistria am bu wuuteek li des ci Moldavie?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Xaalis (Politics)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ci atum 1994, xare bile mujj na ci sàkkuteefu boppam bu Repubilik bu Transnistria ci Moldovie bu ci penku, mu am nguuram ak xaalisu boppam wante benn dëkk bu bkk ci mbootaayu xeet yi àndu ci.""  This translates to: ""In 1994, conflict arose regarding the proclamation of the Transnistrian Republic in Moldova, it has issues and political problems that remain a hot topic in international relations.""

Therefore, the issue between the Transnistrian Republic and Moldova is primarily **political** in nature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lakk (Language)** - While language is a factor in Moldova, it's not the core of the Transnistria issue.
*   **B: Diine (Religion)** - Religion (Christian Orthodoxy) is mentioned as prevalent in Moldova, but isn’t the central issue with Transnistria.
*   **C: Reconnaissance bu NU (UN Recognition)** -  The passage doesn't specifically mention UN recognition, although it implies a lack of full international acceptance due to the ongoing conflict. It’s a *result* of the political issue, not the issue itself."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la ab wey-tukki wara jot ab wisitu Montevideo su yaakaaare moytu ngelaw yi?","The correct answer is **C: Ci jamonoy weeri été yu Hemisphère Nord**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes Montevideo's seasons in relation to the Northern Hemisphere's summer.** It states that when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere (temperatures above +30°C), it's winter in Montevideo.  It then explains that Montevideo's winter, while sometimes cold (even near zero), isn't as harsh as in other places.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ci jamonoy sédd yu weeri Hemisphère Nord:** This is too broad. The text focuses specifically on *été* (summer) in the Northern Hemisphere.
    * **B: Ci jamonoy tangaay:**  The text doesn't generally talk about the length of the seasons, only the *relationship* between them.
    * **D: Ci weeri séddaay yu Montevideo:** This is too specific. The question asks about what causes the seasons, not just a description of Montevideo's seasons themselves.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la ab wey-tukki wara dem Montevideo sudee dañoo and ci climat bu sédd?","The correct answer is **A: Su été bi jotee ci Montevideo**.

* This directly indicates that summer *is* happening in Montevideo at the time described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Su été bi jotee ci Hemisphère Nord** - The text doesn't specify the Northern Hemisphere. It talks about Montevideo's location in the *southern* tropics.
* **C: Su nekkee ci jamonoy taw ci Montevideo** - The text focuses on the summer season, not the autumn.
* **D: Su jamonoy sédd jotee ci Hemisphère Nord** - Similar to B, the text doesn't mention the Northern Hemisphere or autumn.

* **The passage states:** ""...ay xale yuy yàkk moomeel gu ñëpp bokk ak bu kenn moom di jëfandikoo pentuur bu nuy pomp...ay etiket yuñu mënul jang.""  This directly translates to ""...some tags that are often associated with and linked to the spreading of vibrant paint...labels that are easily recognizable.""  ""Balises"" means tags/labels, and ""yuñu mënul jang"" means easily recognizable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xew-xewi Graffiti:** While the passage mentions ""xew-xewi graffiti,"" it's *an example* of graffiti, not the overall subject of what's being described as easily recognizable.
* **B: Jaxase:** This doesn't relate to the context of the passage.
* **C: Peinture ci miir yuñu jagleel askan wi:** This translates to ""paint on walls that are very visible."" While graffiti *is* often on visible walls, the passage focuses on the identifying *marks* (the tags) themselves, not just the location.



"
Yan xeeti festivalu misig la yenn nit yuy teew di jappee ni lu manta ñakk ci seen jaar-jaar?,"The correct answer is **B: Def camping ci barab bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Way-fekkee yu ci ëpp dañ koy jàppee xaaj bu am solo ci luñuy dundu."" This translates to ""People in groups decided to camp on the side.""  This directly relates to finding a camping spot.
* **The question asks:** About someone wanting to camp at the festival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indi say doom:** (Having a good time) - While the festival *is* enjoyable, the question is specifically about camping.
* **C: Teg misig ci guddi gi:** (Listening to music in the crowd) - This is an activity *at* the festival, not related to camping.
* **D: Teela aksi:** (Asking for help) - The passage doesn't mention needing help, it focuses on the decision *to* camp.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan kuy dem ci fesval gëna jox gëdd su bëggee compé ci wetu misig bi?","The correct answer is **C: Campé ci biti dal bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""li ëpp ci way-fekkee yi ci festiwaalu misik yi dañuy decidé campé ci si bi..."" (those who come to the music festival decided to camp there...) and ""...so bëggee jege jëf ji dina laaj nga teela jog ngir am ab camping bi ngay dàl bu jegge misig bi."" (they really wanted to get a camping spot near the music.)

This directly indicates that people are going to the festival to camp near the music.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dem ci guddi gi (Go to the crowd):** While people will likely *go* to the crowd to listen to music, the passage focuses on the *preparation* for camping.
* **B: Nekk ci barab buñu jagleel njabóot gi (Sit in a fancy decorated booth):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Teela aksi (Ask questions):** While someone might ask questions, it's not the primary reason people are going.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, fan visiteur yi wara moytu suñuy wut dundu guddi ci bëj-saalumu Nouveau Mexique?","The correct answer is **A: Pueblos**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soo leen bayyee xel ci limu pueblos yi..."" (They have a lot of knowledge about the pueblos) and goes on to describe them as places people travel to, choosing between Albuquerque and Santa Fe to visit.
* The passage also mentions casinos and shops, but frames them as *within* the pueblos or as reasons people visit the area *because* of the pueblos.  The primary focus is on the pueblos themselves as the destination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baaru dëkk bu ndaw (Shops in town):** While mentioned, they aren't the main draw.
* **C: Sàntar komersio yi (Shopping centers):** Not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Casinos yi (Casinos):** Casinos are a *part* of the attraction, but not the primary reason people come.



"
Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi fan la ab visiteur gênee mëna gis ay po yuñu xam bu baax ci bëj-saalumu Nouveau Mexique?,"The correct answer is **D: Ci ab dëkk bu ndaw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bayyil xel: baar yu nekk ci gox yu ndàw yi duñuy faral di baax ngir ñiy wisit ci bitim réew ngir dem fa."" This translates to: ""The idea is: shops in the downtown areas are very useful for visitors to the country to shop.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A & C (Casinos):** While the passage mentions casinos, it says they are often far from the cities and not ideal for first-time visitors looking to explore.
* **B (Pueblo):** The passage mentions pueblos, but doesn't specifically recommend visiting them as a priority for newcomers.  It focuses on the convenience of downtown shops.



"
Way-tukki yuy xalaat seen budget war nañu bëgg a moytu ban xeetu naan?,"The correct answer is **A: Vin bu Australie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Australians yi danu jap ni xalaatuk ‘flat white’ kafé lu gnu jagaani la."" This translates to ""Australians like to drink 'flat white' coffee with their meals.""  The question asks what you might order if you want something to drink and are on a budget.  While juice (D) is also a drink, the text specifically highlights Australians and their preference for 'flat white' coffee.  'Flat white' is a type of coffee, and ordering a coffee would be a common, relatively affordable option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndox yuñu def ci biteel:** This refers to bottles of water, which isn't explicitly linked to being budget-friendly in the text.
* **C: Biyeeru dëkk bi:** This means shopping at the store, not something you *drink*.
* **D: Jus de fruits:** While juice is a drink, the text doesn't focus on it like it does with Australian coffee preferences.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci barab buñu xamle ci xët bi, ban ci yile naan lañu mëna jaawatle ak seveur?","The correct answer is **B: Ab Nimero Un** (Number One).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sàngaara bu nu gëna jëfandikoo gi mooy ‘Number One’, nekkul sàngara bu nàkkari, wante neex te sedd.""  This translates to: ""The wine we like most is ‘Number One’, a very good wine, very nice to drink.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nuwaar bu gatt:** The text doesn't mention this specific type of wine.
*   **C: Ab Sauvignon bu Weex bu New Zealand:** While New Zealand wines *are* mentioned as being good, this specific wine isn't highlighted as the favorite.
*   **D: Ab weex bu tàcc:**  The text doesn't mention this type of wine.



"
"Ci diirup ñetti siyeekal, diiru kolonisasioŋ bi ban kuréel moo ko tambali woon?","The correct answer is **D: The Spaniards**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Spaniards yi dooronnagnu diirruk nootél bi nékkon ci gnetti xarnu."" This translates to ""The Spaniards strongly desired the land that existed at that time.""  This directly indicates the Spaniards were the driving force behind the colonization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: The Payaguá:** The passage mentions the Payaguá as an indigenous group *affected* by colonization, not as colonizers themselves.
*   **B: The Guaycurú:** Similar to the Payaguá, the Guaycurú were indigenous and impacted by colonization.
*   **C: The Guaraní:** The Guaraní are described as the original inhabitants of the land, and while their land was taken, they weren't the colonizers.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy anam bi gën ngir fexe ba ab parisien tangal sa yaram?","The correct answer is **A: Jéema toppandoo ni parisien di doxalee**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...anam bi gëna baax ngir deggoo ca Paris mooy ba tey ci sa doxaliin bi gën, di jëfee niki nit ku yaru lool.""  This translates to ""...the reason people like to come to Paris is often because of its generous lifestyle, and it easily attracts many people who are very generous.""  This describes Parisians as being generous (doxal).

* **The question (Q) asks:** What is suggested in the text, that people come to Paris because of the Parisians'...?

* **Option A (""Jéema toppandoo ni parisien di doxalee"")** translates to ""Generosity of Parisians.""  This directly reflects the passage's statement about Parisians' generous lifestyle being a draw for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wone koolute:** (They are cool) - The passage doesn't focus on ""coolness.""
* **C: Nekk ku yaru:** (They are generous) - While true, it doesn't explain *why* people come to Paris, as the question asks. It's a characteristic *of* the Parisians, not the reason for attraction.
* **D: Wone ab doxaliin extraverti:** (They are extroverted) - The passage doesn't mention extroversion.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile lañu jàppewul ni ab baaxaay buy toppandoo waa paris?","The correct answer is **A: Yaraduku**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes Paris as a place that attracts many people, even those who are poor (""nit ku yaru lool"").** It emphasizes the allure and the dream associated with living in Paris.
* **""Yaraduku"" (attraction/magnetism) best captures this idea.** Paris *attracts* people.
* Let's look at why the other options are wrong:
    * **B: Reewande (wealth/abundance)** - While Paris has wealth, the passage focuses on the *pull* it has on people, not just its riches.
    * **C: Caaxaan (history)** - Paris has a rich history, but that's not the central theme of this excerpt.
    * **D: Tembere (work)** - While people go to Paris for work, the passage highlights a broader sense of hope and aspiration.

**Therefore, ""Yaraduku"" (attraction) is the most fitting answer to the question about what draws people to Paris according to the text.**



"
Lan mooy awantaasu Première Classe ci MétroRail bu Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **A: Tàggatkat bi ci ginnaaw raay bi lay nekk**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Autocar MetroPlus yi ñooy nekk saa yu nekk ci catu train bi gëna jege Cap Town."" This translates to ""MetroPlus buses are located at stations along the train line that goes to Cape Town.""  This implies a higher class/better service (MetroPlus) exists *along* the regular train line.
* **""Première Classe"" (First Class)** aligns with a higher-level service like MetroPlus.  The passage describes MetroPlus as a better option, making it the equivalent of First Class.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **B: Nit ci tolloo wuñu (People in the shadows)** - irrelevant to the passage.
    * **C: Moo gëna yomb tieketu Troisième Classe (Have a Third Class ticket)** - MetroPlus is *better* than the regular train, not worse.
    * **D: Benn njëg la ak bu tiketu Métro (Just get on with a Metro ticket)** - This doesn't acknowledge the upgraded MetroPlus service.

Therefore, the passage suggests MetroPlus is the equivalent of First Class travel on the Cape Town train system."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo nekk ci otoraay banlieu bu nekk?","The correct answer is **A: Ab métro bu bariwul nit**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Dañuy joxe ker MetroPlus moo gëna neex te bariwul nit wante dafa xawaa seer..."" (This refers to MetroPlus being used by many people to travel).  This directly links MetroPlus to being a way for people to travel.
* **The question asks:** ""...lan moo nekk ci otoraay banlieu bu nekk?"" (Which means, ""What is this about, regarding a public transport system?"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Benn njëgu tiket ngir ñaari classes yi** (Tickets for different classes) - The text doesn't focus on ticket prices or classes.
* **C: Ñetti classes yu wuute** (Specific classes) - The text doesn't detail specific classes.
* **D: Métro wu Première classe ak Troisième classe** (First and Third class metro) - While the text mentions metro classes, it's not the *main* point being made.  The primary focus is the use of MetroPlus by many people.



"
Ban ci yile jëf la ab mala bu am feebar warul mêna def?,"The correct answer is **C: Wasaare ab infection** (Meaning: Cause of infection).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""Feebar yuy wàllé ci seen bopp, wala mala yu soxor yi mëna saaga wala rey ay nit ci doole, duñ leen di faral di jàppee ni ay pest."" (Fevers often occur in children, or sometimes in adults, they can be a sign of illness or infection, and can lead to problems with pests.)  This clearly links fever to potential infection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Joxe ay picc** (Meaning: Small insects) - While pests are mentioned, the *cause* of the fever isn't insects themselves.
* **B: Waral ay alersi** (Meaning: Food allergies) - The passage doesn't discuss allergies.
* **D: Waral ay gaañu yu metti** (Meaning: Lack of good nutrition) - While nutrition is important for health, the passage specifically links fever to illness/infection.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Fan lañuy mëna jëndee ak kartu telefon yuñu fay ba noppi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci bitiku koñ bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Bëpp rukk ci bitik bi da fess ak alluwa yu jaxasso ak kaart telefon buñu faay bapare yuñu mëna jëfandikoo ci telefonu mbeed wala telefonu loxo.""  This translates to: ""People used to go to shops to buy and use phone cards to make calls from fixed or mobile phones.""

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""Where did people usually make calls with phone cards?""

* **Option C (""Ci bitiku koñ bi"" - In the shops)** directly answers the question based on the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci réew yuñu tànn (In the countries they lived in):** Too broad and doesn't specify *where* within those countries.
* **B: Ab arrêt wu otoraay (At the bus station):**  Not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Ci kabin telefon yi (In phone booths):** While phone booths *could* have been used, the passage specifically mentions shops (bitiku).



"
Nan lañuy jotee ci njëgi woote yu gëna yomb ci yenn kart yi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ci bitiku koñ bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Bëpp rukk ci bitik bi da fess ak alluwa yu jaxasso ak kaart telefon..."" (Bëpp deals with shops that accept phone cards...). This directly links the service to shops.
* **The question (Q) asks:** Where can you use these cards?
* **Options A, B, and D** are not supported by the text. The text doesn't mention specific countries (A), specific phone numbers (B), or a general ability to use on any phones (D).

Therefore, the most logical and textually supported answer is **C: Ci bitiku koñ bi** (In certain shops).



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile garab moo gëna ñakka siiw ci park national bu Plitvice Lakes?","The passage (P) describes the Plitvice Lakes National Park and mentions various trees: beech (beeri), fir (tolu), spruce (siiru), moose (muusu), and others. It specifically mentions beech trees as being beautiful and common.

The question (Q) asks which tree is commonly found in the Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Looking at the options:

*   **A: Hêtre** - This is the French word for **Beech**.
*   **B: Chêne** - This is the French word for **Oak**.
*   **C: Sapin** - This is the French word for **Fir**.
*   **D: Épicéa** - This is the French word for **Spruce**.

Since the passage highlights *beeri* (beech) trees, the correct answer is **A: Hêtre**.



"
Ban ci yi àlli mala lañu mëna gis ci park national bu Plitvice Lakes?,"The passage describes various animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park, including bears, wolves, lynx, deer, and various birds. It specifically mentions a ""mala yu jafeee gis yu melni urs bu sokoolaa bu Ëropë"" which translates to a brown bear (urs bu sokoolaa) of Europe.

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: Koppin** - This doesn't appear to be a known animal.
*   **B: Blaireau de miel (Honey Badger)** - While a fascinating animal, it's not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Casoar (Cassowary)** - This is an Australian bird, not found in Europe or Croatia.
*   **D: grand tétras (Western Capercaillie)** - This is a type of grouse, and birds are mentioned in the passage as being present, but the passage *specifically* highlights the bear.

Considering the detailed description of the bear in the passage, the most accurate answer is none of the provided options fully capture the content of the passage. However, **D: grand tétras** is the closest as it is a bird mentioned to be in the park.

**However, the passage focuses heavily on the bear, and none of the options are a bear. This suggests there may be an issue with the question or the provided options.**



"
Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi; lan la kotu diiwaan yi di jariñ?,"The correct answer is **D: Sotti bu jaarul yoon**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) states: ""...koti diiwaan yi amu ñu lenn luñuy def ci **sotti yu jaarul yoon**; sotti wu tuuti-tuuti ci ab disk dina dox bu baax ci bépp jumtukaay bu orosinaal bi mëna doxee.""  This directly translates to ""...the authors often rely on **stories of the past**; stories that are densely packed with valuable information about original cultural practices.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sotti ay disk:** While disks are mentioned, they are *containing* the stories, not the stories themselves.
*   **B: Saytu marsé bi:** The ""marsé"" (market) site is mentioned as a place where the stories are found, but not the stories themselves.
*   **C: Artu ci pirat yi:** This option is not mentioned in the text.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy ab fen ci ni kotu diiwaan yu ay këri-liggéeyukaay yuy yëngu ci tass xibaar siiwal?","The correct answer is **B: Dañuy tax ñu mêna moytu sotti yu jaarul yoon** (They often seek more detailed information).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ci kaw loolu, koti diiwaan yi amu ñu lenn luñuy def ci sotti yu jaarul yoon"" -  ""In this regard, readers often want to find more detailed information."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Da ñoo am solo ngir am yeneeni saytug marsé** (There is nothing to help with market research) - The passage mentions market research (""saytug marsé"") but doesn't say there's *nothing* to help with it.  It talks about the *need* for detail.
* **C: Dañoo am solo ngir def xaalis di dem ak ñëw** (There is nothing to help with opening a new path) - This is unrelated to the passage's focus on detailed information.
* **D: Dañuy jappale ci lu neew ci artu ci pirat yi** (They rely on what is new in piracy) - This is completely off-topic and has no connection to the text.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that accurately reflects a point made in the passage."
"Soo aksee ci sa réewum cosaan, ban doxaliin mooy faral di nekk lu informel?","The correct answer is **A: Ay saytug imigarasioŋ** (Immigration officials).

Here's why:

* **P's text describes a situation at a border crossing.** People are being checked (""bi saytu amulé ci tukki gi"") and asked questions (""saytuk takk dér yi ak xulloo lay doon""). This strongly suggests an immigration or border control scenario.
* **Q's question asks about who deals with people coming into a country (""soo aksee ci sa réewum cosaan"").**  This is directly the responsibility of immigration officials.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xamle ay mbir (Customs officers):** While customs officers might be present at a border, the description in P focuses on *people* being checked, not *goods*.
* **C: Yemaley bu teggu ci yoon bu mbir yi (People working on border security):** This is too broad. It *includes* immigration officials, but isn't the specific profession being asked about.
* **D: Saytug douane (Customs officers):** Same reasoning as B.  Focus is on people, not goods.



"
Yan ci yile nga wara xam laata nga aksi ci sa réewum cosaan?,"The correct answer is **A: Su naree am ab barabu saytug imigarasioŋ** (I don't have the required immigration papers).

Here's why:

* **P's text describes someone being stopped at a checkpoint (tukki) and questioned about their papers.** They are worried about not having the correct documents.  The phrase ""saytug takk dér yi ak xulloo lay doon"" strongly suggests document issues.
* **Q asks if the person knows why they are being questioned in their country.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: So waree xamle mbir yi ci yemaley yoon** (I don't know the laws of this country) - While possible, the context points to a *specific* document issue rather than general legal ignorance.
* **C: Su naree am ay saytug douane** (I don't have any customs papers) - Customs papers are relevant for *goods*, not generally for being stopped at a checkpoint.
* **D: Ndax amul lenn ci li ngay indaale lu ñuy tere** (Because there's something wrong with what I'm carrying) - This is too vague. The passage implies the issue is with *who they are* (their documentation) rather than *what they have*.



Therefore, lacking the necessary immigration papers is the most logical reason for being stopped and questioned as described in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, bariwaayu lu tax yeegkat yi gis lu bari ay yoon yu ees ci biir Cochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **A: Ay gisiin**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""mu bari lool ay mur ak xeer yu mag"" which translates to ""it has many walls and beautiful cliffs.""
* **""Gisiin""** means ""cliffs"" or ""rock faces"" in Wolof. This directly corresponds to the description of the valley having many walls and cliffs, making it a prime location for climbing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Ay cat (Cats):**  The passage doesn't mention animals.
* **Ay pic (Picks):** While climbers *use* picks, the passage isn't *about* the equipment.
* **Ay miir (Mirrors):** This has no relevance to the description of the valley.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xibaar yuñu joxe ci xët bi, kan mooy jiite jeggi yu gëna mag ci Hemisphère Nord?","The correct answer is **A: SkyTeam**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amul benn compagnie aérienne buy boole ñatti jëmuwaay yooyu di jeggi océanique ci hémisphère sud (te SkyTeam bokkul ci benn ci jéggi yooyu).""  This translates to: ""Some airline companies want to develop routes for oceanic flights in the southern hemisphere (or SkyTeam is already among those developing these routes).""

The question asks about airlines that are *not* heavily present in the Southern Hemisphere, implying a stronger presence in the Northern Hemisphere.  Since SkyTeam is mentioned as being involved in the Southern Hemisphere, it logically follows they are more established elsewhere – namely the Northern Hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Star Alliance:** The text specifically states Star Alliance *is* developing routes in the South Pacific.
*   **C: Pacifique Sud:** This is a location, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld:**  LATAM Oneworld is also mentioned as being present in the South Pacific.



"
Ban alliance tukkib asamaan mo am ay jeggi yu gëna neew ci ocean bi ci Hemisphère Sud?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Alliance dina naaw fépp bamu des ci Pacifique Sud-Est, bu Santiago bu Chili ba ci Tahiti..."" This directly translates to ""Star Alliance now has flights in the South-East Pacific, from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti...""

Therefore, Star Alliance is the alliance with flights covering a significant area of the Southern Hemisphere oceans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pacifique Sud (South Pacific)** - This is a *location*, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld** - The text says LATAM *also* has flights, but it doesn't imply they have more extensive coverage than Star Alliance.
*   **D: SkyTeam** - The text states SkyTeam *doesn't* have many flights in the Southern Hemisphere.



"
Ban nosug tukki moo wuuti Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kiy wuutu ci **Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours** amalna ay fukk ak ñaar yu beeri ñuy amal saytu ci ñénti kembaar yi.""  This directly identifies Go Running Tours as being associated with Global Running Tours.

The other options are mentioned as *examples* of running tours *within* the Global Running Tours network, but Go Running Tours is presented as a direct partner/associate.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, Go Running Tours dafay tax ñu mêna lëkkale ay nosukaayi sightrunning yu bari?","The correct answer is **A: Ñeent (No)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Go Running Tours and similar companies *offer* guided running tours. It doesn't say they *only* offer that, or that they're limited to a specific number of tours. The question asks if they *only* offer sightrunning tours, and the text doesn't support that claim.  They offer tours *including* sightrunning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 200** - This refers to the distance of 200 meters, not the number of tours.
* **C: Ay douzaine (A dozen)** - The text doesn't mention any specific number like a dozen.
* **D: Ñett (Yes)** -  The text doesn't state they *only* offer sightrunning tours.



"
Lan la ab tourist wara def su yaakaare gis ci anam bu gëna leer ab guépard?,"The correct answer is **B: Dem doxantu ci àll bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Doxu safari (ñu gën ko xam ci ab “doxu àll”, “ doxantu safari, wala dem”cukki cukki”) dafa aju ci doxantu, doonte ay waxtu yu tuuti wala ay bés yu bare."" This directly translates to ""Walking safari (they also call it 'walking in the bush', 'doxantu safari, or dem') is done on foot, without specific times or expensive equipment.""
* **The question asks:** Where can a tourist go to see cheetahs?
* **The passage then says:** ""Ay gayndé, cheetahs ak ay ségg yénn say dagniy tooy, bugnu nékké gnaar ngalén di geenee gis."" - meaning cheetahs and lions are often seen during walking safaris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dem ci ay safari yéeg:**  The passage doesn't specifically mention cheetahs being easily seen on all safaris, just *doxantu* safaris.
* **C: Jëfandikoo ay xoolukaay:** While safaris *do* involve observing animals, this isn't the specific answer to *where* you'd find cheetahs.
* **D: Jël ab woto te jëfandikoo jumtukaay yu baaxoo yi:**  This is too general and doesn't focus on cheetahs specifically.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu mala ab visiteur buñu mëna taseel sooy dem sorti wu safari ci ab ndamar?","The correct answer is **A: Gayndé yi** (Lions).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ay gayndé, cheetahs ak ay ségg yénn say dagniy tooy, bugnu nékké gnaar ngalén di geenee gis.""  This translates to: ""Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often seen, frequently appearing near water sources.""

The question asks what animals a visitor might specifically hope to see during a safari. While cheetahs and leopards are mentioned, lions (""gayndé"") are presented as a prominent sighting. Therefore, lions are the most likely answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ñamala yi** (Elephants) - Elephants are mentioned as being *seen* but not specifically *hoped for* as a main attraction.
*   **C: Ségg yi** (Leopards) - Like cheetahs, leopards are mentioned but not highlighted as a key safari experience.
*   **D: Guépard yi** (Cheetahs) - Same as leopards - mentioned, but not the primary focus.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy mëna waññi njëgu ab wisit?","The correct answer is **D: Wut kuréel bu am juróomi nit wala luko ëpp**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses the negative impact of tourism on local culture and the exploitation of people for profit (""feesal wt yi""). It mentions people being used (""kuréllu gnént japp juroom bénn ngir xayma nit bu geen"") and the problems arising from this (""buy puus nit ñi ñu yaakaar nañoo fay lu ëpp"").  Essentially, it's talking about a problematic, exploitative tourism.

* **Q (the question)** asks about the main concern raised in the text.

* **Option D (""Wut kuréel bu am juróomi nit wala luko ëpp"" - Exploitation of people or lack of respect)** directly addresses the core issue described in the passage. The text focuses on how tourism leads to the exploitation and disrespect of local people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Demal sa bopp (Loss of traditions)** - While the passage *implies* a loss of traditions, it's a consequence of the exploitation, not the main concern itself.
* **B: Wut kuréel bu am ñeenti ni (Problems with numbers/quantity)** - The text isn't about the *amount* of tourism, but the *way* it's conducted.
* **C: Dem ak beneen nit (Connection with people)** -  The passage describes a *disconnection* and exploitative relationship, not a positive connection.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan moo wara mën àar jëgi wisit yi?","The correct answer is **A: Touristes yu bëgg a jaxase woto yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Loolu waru la jaaxaal ndaxte turist yi danuleen d jaxase yen say ngir feesal wt yi.""  This translates to ""This is important because tourists come and want to visit these places to appreciate the heritage.""
* **Option A** directly reflects this idea – ""Tourists who come to visit places.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ab kuréelu ñett:** (Only bad things) - The passage doesn't focus solely on negative aspects.
* **C: Ñaari xarit yuy ànd di tukki:** (People who cut trees) - The passage mentions cutting trees, but it's not the main point of the question.
* **D: Ab kuréel bu am juróomi nit:** (Bad things that cause people to move) - While the passage hints at issues, the question asks what the passage *specifically* emphasizes.

San Francisco moy tamit barab bu gëna ci réew mi yen togg wa Asi :korean, thai, indian, ak saponné.""  This translates to: ""San Francisco has many great places to attract tourists with hotels, restaurants, and many modern shops. San Francisco is famous for having many places from Asian countries: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions culture (music, film, literature), it doesn't specifically say people are drawn *because of* art galleries and shops.
* **B:** The passage mentions shops but doesn't say they are for conventions/congresses.
* **C:**  ""Wuute gi am ci koom bi"" doesn't relate to why people visit San Francisco.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax yu àju ci San Francisco mo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **D: Mbooleen koom gi mu ngi àju ci tourisme** (Its economy is very important for tourism).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes San Francisco's reliance on tourism.** It states it attracts many tourists, has numerous hotels, restaurants, and bars catering to them, and benefits economically from their presence.  The passage directly links the city's success to tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dañ ko doon teg lu bari ci fimu yi ak di ko bind ci téere yi** (It's very strong in movies and binding threads) - While the passage mentions film and literature, it doesn't say these are strengths of *the city itself* or key to its success.
* **B: Toggu Asie moo nekkoon gan bu mag bi** (Asian food is very prevalent) - This is true *as a result* of the tourism and diverse population, but it's not the core point about the city's overall significance.
* **C: Amna ay otel ak ay barabi defukaayu congrés yu bari** (It has many hotels and large congress halls) - This is a *feature* of the city supporting tourism, but not the central idea of *why* it's important.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu tukkikat moo warul jariñoo ci jëfandikoo ay sàrwiisi tukkikat?","The correct answer is **D: Ab tukkikat bu taamu japplu ay forfaits**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses travel agents helping people find hotels and potentially camping options (packages).**  The phrase ""Agent de voyage yi dañooy faral di am ab déggoo ak yenn otel yuñu tànn"" directly states this.  It also mentions different travel styles (luxury hotels vs. camping).
* **""Forfaits"" translates to ""packages"" in English.** This aligns perfectly with the services travel agents provide – putting together travel arrangements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ab tukkikat bu mënul jël dogal (Travel agents who simply provide information):** While agents *provide* information, the text focuses on *arranging* travel, not just giving advice.
* **B: Ab tukkikat bu bëgg lu jamp (Travel agents who beg to travel):** This is nonsensical and doesn't relate to the passage.
* **C: Ab tukkikat bu jëlagul visa wam (Travel agents who help with visas):**  Visas are *a part* of travel, but the passage doesn’t specifically mention visa assistance as a primary service. The focus is on lodging and travel styles.



"
Yan ci yile lañu limul ci xët bi niki ab njuréef jàpp palaas ci ab ndawal këru tukki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ay forfait yu boole lépp**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses packages (forfaits) that include transportation and accommodation.** It mentions agents helping with hotels and camping, and describes options like organized tours (tukki) with included meals and activities. ""Forfaits"" directly translates to packages.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ay wayndare tukki yuñu gaawal:** While the passage mentions tours, it doesn't focus on *only* the tours themselves, but the complete package.
    * **B: Ay jaayum otel:** Hotels are *part* of the packages, but not the core of what the passage is about.
    * **D: Yore ab reservation:** Reservations are a *result* of booking a package, not the package itself.

**Translation of the relevant part of the passage:**

""Agent de voyage yi dañooy faral di am ab déggoo ak yenn otel yuñu tànn... niki ay barabi camping, ci ab agent de voyage. Gniy yeengu ci tukki yénn say dagnuy mayé ndékki, ak yombalalla lula yobb/indi ci aydapor bi wala ay tukki ci ay roppalan ak ay keereuk dallu kaay.""

This translates to: ""Travel agents are often helpful in finding accommodations and hotels... including camping, through travel agents.  They offer tours with included meals, and sometimes lodging/food included in the price or tours with excursions and other activities.""  This clearly indicates packages/forfaits.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan la jëfekaayu tekki lakki ci lu gaaw la lañu mënul def?","The correct answer is **A: Tekki ay mandarga ci lakki bitim-réew** (Information about language learning for international travelers).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Yenn ci joxe ci kategori biile mën na sax tekki ay bind ci kàllaama yeneen réew cii ay màndarga..."" This translates to ""It includes access to categories with advice for travelers in foreign countries...""
* **The passage focuses on:** Applications that help with communication when traveling, dealing with different languages, and understanding cultural differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tekki mbooleem pàcci jukki (Information about generally useful tricks):** While the apps might *have* some general tricks, the primary focus is language and travel.
* **C: Tekki ay jukki ci ay yëf jaare ko ci smartphone (Tricks for making phones work better):**  The passage mentions phones as the *platform* for these apps, not the apps themselves being about phone functionality.
* **D: Tekki bu baax 100% ci temps bi (Perfect information about time):** This is not mentioned in the text at all.



"
Lan mooy tax ñu mëna def ay tekki fu amul net?,"The correct answer is **B: Smartphones**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes applications (apps) that allow you to translate languages, particularly for communication.** It mentions using them to understand texts or speak with people from different countries.
* **Smartphones are the devices on which these translation applications are used.** The passage even mentions using them with phones (""joxañee telefonam ci mbir yooyule"").
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Jumtukaayi tekki yuñu yeesal** (Difficult languages to learn) - The passage is about *translating* languages, not the difficulty of learning them.
    * **C: Yebbi ay données wu lakk** (Having language data) - This is a component *within* the apps, not the device itself.
    * **D: Ay jëfekaayi xi wàllu tekki ci lu gaaw** (Tools that don't need translation) - This contradicts the entire point of the passage.



"
Ban ci yile moo nekkul luy dekkal ay avalanche?,"The correct answer is **A: Neige bu kolé** (Heavy snow).

Here's why, based on the Wolof text (P):

* **The text describes a situation with heavy snow.** Phrases like ""mabb dulu jaarul yoon"" (much snow fell yesterday) and references to snow causing difficulties (""tuuti galas suy wàcc mën na yóbbaale yi des"" - many cars got stuck because of the snow) clearly indicate a heavy snowfall event.
* **The question (Q) asks about what causes avalanches.** Heavy snow is a primary cause of avalanches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nit ñi (People)** - People don't cause avalanches directly.
* **C: Fentug naaj (Strong wind)** - Wind *can* contribute to avalanche risk, but isn't the primary cause.
* **D: Yeneen waccug neige (Old snow)** - While old snow layers can contribute to avalanche instability, it's the addition of *new*, heavy snow that often triggers them.



Therefore, **Neige bu kolé (Heavy snow)** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text and question."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mooy wàcc niki ay avanlanche?","The correct answer is **C: Bariwaay neige ci pente yu jub yi**.

Here's why, based on the Wolof text (P):

* **The text describes a dangerous situation with snow:** ""Mabb dulu jaarul yoon; mbartal mi mën na yééx..."" (It was a snowy year; the snow was heavy...)  It goes on to talk about avalanches and the danger they pose to livestock and people.
* **The text mentions slopes (""pente yu jub yi""):** ""...tuuti galas suy wàcc mën na yóbbaale yi des"" (many animals died on the slopes).
* **The text directly relates snow to danger on slopes.** The whole passage is *about* avalanches happening *because* of snow accumulating on slopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Neige buy kolé buñu dekkalul (Snow simply falls and is beautiful):** This is the *opposite* of the text's tone. The text highlights the *danger* of the snow.
* **B: Ay pente yu jub yu amul neige (Some slopes are full of snow):** While true according to the text, this isn't the *core* problem described. It's the danger *caused* by the snow on the slopes.
* **D: Neige bu nit ñi laalul (Snow that people look at):** This is irrelevant to the text's central theme of danger and avalanches.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the main idea of the passage – the danger of snow accumulating on slopes, leading to avalanches."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, curry ci ay ingrédient la jogé?","The correct answer is **B: Ñax ak épices** (Meat and spices).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Curry ak gnamla bugnu défaré ay gnax ak ay kaani, ak ndawal wala ay léjum."" This translates to ""Curry with various preparations uses meat and vegetables, as well as rice or legumes.""  It also mentions spices being important for the flavor (""danuy faral di jëfandikoo soow ci kari yi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yawuur ak ndox (Milk and meat):** While meat is mentioned, milk isn't.
* **C: Meewu koko ak yàpp (Cocoa butter and oil):** These aren't mentioned in the passage as key ingredients.
* **D: Lejum ak meew (Legumes and fish):** Legumes are mentioned *as an option*, but not as a core ingredient like meat and spices. Fish isn't mentioned at all.



"
"Ci yenn diiwaan yi, meewu koko luñuy j¨fandikoo la ci barabu ban ingrédient ci ab curry?","The correct answer is **D: Epices**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly discusses curry and its ingredients.** It mentions that the flavor of curry comes from spices (""épices"" in French, which is the language of the passage). It specifically highlights how different regions (India and Pakistan) use spices differently.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Yàpp:** This doesn't relate to curry ingredients.
    * **B: Lejum:** While ""léjum"" is mentioned in the passage, it's stated as *one of the things curry is NOT*, not an ingredient.
    * **C: Yawuur:** This doesn't relate to curry ingredients.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that **épices (spices)** are the key ingredients used to flavor curry.



"
Lu tax ñuy wara wër Montaañu Transantarctique yi ngir àgg ci plateaux yu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tracteur yu xarañ yi nooyi wuñu** (The powerful tractors help them).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mën nan ci tukki jëfandikoo ay taaktër rekk, di yóbbu ay sarsi petorol ak marsandiis."" (They only had a few vehicles, to carry petrol and merchandise.)  This implies the vehicles, specifically tractors, are crucial for traversing the difficult terrain.
* **The question asks:** What helps them cross the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateaus?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Station bu McMurdo Station dafay faral di tej** (McMurdo Station is a base for rest) -  McMurdo Station is a *starting point* or a place to return *to*, not what helps them *cross* the mountains.
* **B: Neige bu jàpp bi dafa wóoradi** (The heavy snow is hindering) - Snow is an *obstacle*, not a help.
* **D: Moo gën yomb tukki jëm Mer Rose** (There is a path through the Ross Sea) - The passage describes traveling *over* land, not *through* the sea.



"
"Ci jeggikaayu Pôle Sud, lan lañu mandargaal ay drapeau?","The correct answer is **D: Ay jàddukaay yu wóoradi ci montaañ yi**.

Here's why:

* **P's text states:** ""...yoon wi dafay am wiiri ci montaañ buy lëkkële antarktik di ñëw ci asset bi.""  This translates to ""...they often have flags on the high Antarctic mountains to mark the route."" This directly answers the question about flags being used near the South Pole.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sentier station bu McMurdo:** The text mentions McMurdo station, but not flags *at* the station itself.
* **B: Tracteur yuy yobbu esans:** This refers to tractors carrying fuel, a logistical detail, not flags.
* **C: Crevasse yu fees dell ak neigne:**  Crevasses are dangerous cracks in the ice; the text mentions them as a hazard, not something marked with flags.



"
Lan lañu bindul ci xët bi niki lu touriste yi wara xam suñuy dem ci xaaj bi féete Afrique du Sud?,"The correct answer is **A: Réew yu bari dañoo am ay càkkutéefi Visas yu wuute** (Many countries require visas).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Li nga wara fay ngir am visa mingi aju ci réew mi nga joge, benn réew bokkul ak moroom ma."" This directly translates to ""It is often necessary to obtain a visa before traveling to the country you are going to, especially countries that are difficult and expensive.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions well-trodden paths (""sentier battus""), it doesn't say this is how tourists should visit. It's simply a characteristic of some areas.
* **C:** The passage implies the opposite – that neighboring countries *do* have issues.  ""Li nga wara fay ngir am visa mingi aju ci réew mi nga joge, benn réew bokkul ak moroom ma."" indicates difficulties with neighboring countries.
* **D:** The passage mentions 4x4 vehicles as helpful for challenging terrain, but doesn't suggest they *solve* the problem of accessing the country; visas are still needed.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañuy wara jàppee niki ab tektal bu bon ngir touriste yuy jéema dem Afrique du Sud ak woto?","The correct answer is **B: Donte ab digle wuñu ab 4x4, mën nañu dem ci barab yu bari ci ab ndamar bu jaadu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ab 4x4 lañu digle bu baax te barab yu bari ndaamaru 4x4 bu am ay pono yu mag lañ fa mëna duggee."" (4x4 vehicles are very useful to them and large roads require 4x4 with good tires to navigate). This directly supports the idea that having a 4x4 is important for navigating the roads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While safaris are a part of tourism, the passage focuses on the *challenges* of road travel, not specifically safaris.
* **C:** The passage suggests some roads are *difficult* to travel, not easy.
* **D:** The passage actually mentions visa difficulties and the fact that countries don't always welcome tourists easily.



"
Ban ci yile lañu limul ci xët bi niki ab mbir mu wóoradi nga teg say bagaas to xoolu lo leen?,"The correct answer is **A: Mën nañ leen sàcc**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lii dafay boole xaar ci rang bi, ab xaj by xentu dorog mëneees nan ko jëfandikoo saa su nekk te kenn du tàggoo.""  This translates to ""This is a serious problem, and unfortunately, many young people are involved in it and no one is helping them.""  The phrase ""Mën nañ leen sàcc"" (meaning ""We have their suffering"") directly reflects this sentiment of acknowledging and feeling the pain and hardship these young people are going through.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mën nga doon kuy yore dorog te do ko xam:** (We will try to help them and understand it) - While a potential solution, the passage focuses on the *current* state of suffering, not a promise of future help.
* **C: Mën nañ leen jawale ak bosu keneen:** (We feel for them and have compassion for them) - While compassion is implied, ""sàcc"" is a more direct and powerful expression of shared suffering.
* **D: Njiit yi mên nañ leen jappee nit ab dankaafu bomb:** (The youth feel the hardship of people and the weight of problems) - This is about *their* feeling, not *our* feeling *for* them, which is what the passage implies.



"
Lan lañu limul ci xët bi ci wàllu yore dorog?,"The correct answer is **C: Mën nañu jëfandikoo ay xaj yuy xeeñcu dorog te duñ la ko yëgël.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states:** ""xaj by xentu dorog mëneees nan ko jëfandikoo saa su nekk te kenn du tàggoo.""  This translates to ""people often finance drugs to get rid of them and nobody cares."" This aligns perfectly with option C, which says people finance things related to drugs and then try to hide them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the passage mentions initial steps in a country, it doesn't focus on *how* they start their journeys.
* **B:** This option talks about good mental health and leaving the country, which isn't the central theme of the passage. The passage focuses on the problems *within* the country.
* **D:**  This focuses on people offering drugs, not financing them to disappear, and doesn't match the nuanced meaning of the passage.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it directly reflects a key point made in the passage."
Ban xeetu naan lañu limul niki luñu wara jéema def ci kër gi ci jamono ji ngay fay nekk?,"The correct answer is **B: Kafé**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) starts by mentioning ""Feesalal sa kër ak kafe ci suba..."" which translates to ""Feesalal at home with coffee in the morning..."".  This immediately establishes coffee as a key element discussed in the text. The question (Q) asks what is commonly drunk at home in the mornings.  Therefore, coffee (Kafé) is the most logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jus (Juice)** - Juice isn't specifically mentioned as a morning drink in the passage.
*   **C: Biyeer (Tea)** - While *ataaya* (chamomile tea) is mentioned, the primary focus starts with coffee.
*   **D: Ataaya (Chamomile Tea)** - While mentioned, it's presented *after* coffee and isn't the central morning beverage described.



"
Ban ci yile nga wara dem ci jamono ji nga fay nekk sudee dañoo xamee dëkk bi ci cosaanu naan?,"The correct answer is **C: Pub yi nga dul faral di dem**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""...demal ci barabi naanukaay yi ak pub yi nekk ci koñ bi nga daanul faral di dem."" This directly translates to ""go to bars and pubs to have a good time.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** Where can you go to have fun and relax in the evening?

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bitiku kafe yi ci biti barab yi bi nga dëkk:** This refers to cafes and small bars near where you live, but isn't the main focus of the passage's advice for a fun evening.
* **B: Mangasinu jus wala kereem:** This refers to juice or cream, which isn't related to going out for fun.
* **D: Restaurant yuy defar ay ataaya camomille:** While the passage mentions chamomile tea, it doesn't suggest going *to* restaurants specifically for it. It's more about the general atmosphere of going out.



"
Fan la picc yuñuy sculpté yi nekk?,"The correct answer is **B: Ci jangu bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ci ëttu jàngu bi, am na ay yàttu naat yu nu defar ak marbre yu am solo yu nekk ci kaw ay sëg.""  This translates to: ""In the old cemetery, there are many graves carved in stone and marble which are located in a beautiful place.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""Fan la picc yuñuy sculpté yi nekk?"" - ""Where are the sculpted pictures located?""
* Therefore, the answer is **""Ci jangu bi""** - ""In the cemetery.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Benn waxtu ak genwall ci diganteem ak wilaas bi:** This doesn't directly answer where the sculptures are.
* **C: Ci duunu Eysturoy:** While the cemetery *is* on Eysturoy, the passage specifically pinpoints the location *within* Eysturoy as the cemetery.
* **D: Ci biir jangu bi:** This means ""near the cemetery"" which isn't as precise as the passage being *in* the cemetery.



"
Ban xeetu visa ñooy wara laaj nga firndeel ni am nga xaalis bu doy bu lay mëna yor?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ndongo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wisa ndongo yi dañuy faral di wuuteel ay càkkutéef ak doxaliinu bindu ak bu turist wala bu liggéey."" This translates to ""Student visas are often required for educational and research purposes as a tourist or resident.""  The passage is discussing visas needed for *students* (ndongo) attending universities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Visa liggéey (Resident Visa):** While mentioned in relation to student visas, the passage is specifically about the visa *needed* to be a student.
*   **B: Visa touriste (Tourist Visa):** The passage contrasts student visas with tourist visas, indicating they are different.
*   **C: Visa bu negandiku (Work Visa):** The passage doesn't mention work visas at all.



"
Kan moo mo wara soxla visa bu yàgg?,"The correct answer is **D: Ab voyageur d’affaires**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...nekk di dem foofu niki ndongo iniwersité dafay faral di laaj ay séjour yu gëna yagg dem fa niki ab turist bu normal kese.""  This means people coming for university (likely for work/research) are staying longer than normal tourists.  Later it says ""...wisa ndongo yi dañuy faral di wuuteel ay càkkutéef ak doxaliinu bindu ak bu turist wala bu liggéey."" This suggests needing documentation *beyond* a typical tourist or visitor visa.
* **""Voyageur d’affaires"" (business traveler)** best fits this description.  Someone traveling for university purposes (research, conferences, etc.) falls under business travel.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Ab tpuriste buy ñëw lu bari:** (A simple tourist) – The passage distinguishes these travelers from those needing extra documentation.
    * **B: Ab tukkikat bu miin:** (A student) - While related, the passage doesn't *directly* state they are students, but rather people connected to universities.
    * **C: Ab ndongo buy jangee bitim-réew:** (A person coming to settle in a country) – This implies permanent relocation, which isn't described in the passage.



"
Kañ nga wara bayyi xel bu baax ci yoo yi?,"The correct answer is **D: Sooy dawal**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) talks about a new journey, and mentions subtropical climates and walking/traveling.** It describes a preference for warm weather (""Sooy dawal"" means warm weather).  The passage highlights enjoying this warm weather for walks and exploring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci weeri été yi (During summer)** - While the climate is warm, the passage doesn't *specifically* focus on summer. It's more generally about warm, subtropical conditions.
* **B: Ci randonnée yi (During hikes)** - While walking is mentioned, the passage doesn't say the *purpose* of the journey is specifically hiking.
* **C: Ci àllu tropical bi (In the tropical climate)** - The passage says *subtropical*, not tropical.  There's a difference!



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan nga wara baña def ngir moytu yoo yi sooy dawal ci àllu tropical bi?","The correct answer is **C: Dawal ci barabi sub-tropical yi** (They grow in subtropical regions).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) states:** ""Donté sax dangay dawal ci subtropical àll bi di taw..."" (These trees grow in subtropical regions...) This directly links the trees to subtropical areas.
* **Q (the question) asks:** Where do these trees grow in relation to tropical regions?
* **Option C** directly answers this question based on the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bayyi ndamar bi mu ubbeku lu yàgg:** (The trees are very tall) - While the passage mentions height, it doesn't answer *where* they grow.
* **B: Dawal ci jamonoy été:** (They grow in the rainy season) -  The passage doesn't discuss seasonality.
* **D: Ñakka bayyi xel ci ndamar bi sooy def randonnée:** (Some people are clever at hiking in these trees) - This is irrelevant to the question about location.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile wax yu àju ci Sundarbans moo nekkul dëgg?","The correct answer is **C: Mooy ceinture u mangrove bi gëna mag ci adduna bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Sundarbans yi mooy waaxi mangrove yi geenee makk ci adduna bi..."" which translates to ""Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dafay wone yenn ci àll yu neew yu ci des:** (It has many new animals in the desert) - The passage doesn't mention deserts or primarily focus on new animals.
* **B: Xaaj ci mbooleem barabam dafa am ay dex:** (It's important because many parks have resources) - While Sundarbans *is* important and a park, this isn't the primary defining characteristic described in the text.
* **D: Dafay dalall ay cerf yu taq yu ëpp ay seggi Bengal:** (It houses many deer, including Bengal tigers) - While the passage *mentions* Bengal tigers and deer, it doesn't say it's primarily known for housing them. It highlights its size and mangrove ecosystem.



"
Ban xaaj ci àll bi moo nekk ci diiwaanu Ind?,"The correct answer is **A: Park National yu Sundarbans**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Wàllu àll bi bokk ci réewum Inde lañuy woowe park national bu Sundarbans yi."" This directly translates to ""Many animals in India have a national park called Sundarbans.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ab santuaire la ngir rabbu àll yi:** While Sundarbans *is* a sanctuary for animals, the text specifically mentions a *national park*.
* **C: Situ patrimoine mondial:** The text mentions Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage site, but this isn't what the animals *are* – it's a designation *of* the area.
* **D: Plaine bu Gange:** The text does not mention the Ganges plain.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kan mooy wara nekk ku am gën gaa neew ab ñakk deggub lakkum angale bu doy?","The correct answer is **A: Nit yuy lakk gën gaa neew yeneen ñaari lakk** (People who speak English well and have a lot of money).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on people who are wealthy (""5 000 làkk amna ci àdduna bi, ci lim boobu amna 20 làkk yu am 50 miliyoŋ"") and who speak English (""dégg Angale bu baax"").** It describes how these people often move to places like Toronto and maintain their distinct accents and cultures.
* **Option B (Nit yu seen at tuuti - People with good manners)** is not mentioned in the text.
* **Option C (Nit yuy tukki ci Toronto - People who live in Toronto)** is too specific. While Toronto is mentioned, the passage is about a broader group of wealthy English speakers *who choose* to live there.
* **Option D (Nit yu magget yi - Rich people)** is incomplete. It doesn't mention the important aspect of English fluency.

The passage clearly points to a group defined by *both* wealth and English language proficiency. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo mën nekk lu jafe wax?","The correct answer is **A: Baat yu am ay accent yu wuute**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bàat yu ñu mbind moo gëna yomba ndànd yenn saay ne bàat yi ñuy wax, tamit. Lii mooy dëggu wax, mu nekk yen saay lu jafee wax wax bu leer."" which translates to ""The things they discuss often resemble what they say, somewhat. This is a good thing, it shows that what they say is true to life.""  Later, it talks about people from different places (Mancunian, Bostonian, etc.) keeping their accents even when living in Toronto. This directly connects to the idea of people speaking with *different accents*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ay dëkkuwaay (Mistakes):** The passage doesn't focus on mistakes.
* **C: Baat yuñu bind (Things they hide):** The passage suggests openness in speech, not hiding things.
* **D: Lakku mbedd mi (My bad habit):** This is not related to the context of the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...rawatina yooyule di dem ci penku ak Jakar/Bumthang dem ci diggante 06:30 ak 07:30."" and ""...Ndéem daamar yiy daw ci dëkk yi dañuy fees, li gën mooy nga jàpp paas ay bés laata."" This means buses leave from Penku around 6:30-7:30 and you should arrive early to get a seat on the first buses.  Option D directly reflects this information, stating the tukki (bus) leaves from Penku and arrives at the stop early (6:20).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While buses go to Jakar, the passage doesn't specifically say the *tukki* starts *from* Jakar.
*   **B:**  The passage states buses *arrive* in Bumthang, not depart from it, and doesn't mention a specific time like ""7i waxtu"".
*   **C:** The passage mentions Paro as a taxi destination with a price, not a bus departure point.



"
Lan moo wara doon ak tektal bu baax ngir ab touriste buy jéema tukki jëm penku bawoo ci arrêt kaar bu nekk ci biir gox bi?,"The correct answer is **D: Taxi buñu bokk mën na doon jumtukaay bi gën ngir tukki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taxis yignu bokk dagnoo gaaw té am noflaay ci tukki bu soriwul, Paro buni mel (Nu 150) ak Punakha (Nu 200).""  This directly translates to taxis are available and affordable for short trips, with prices mentioned for Paro and Punakha.
* **The question asks:** About the best and most convenient option for a tourist to get a short trip to a bus stop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaar yi su 8:30 weeso kese lañuy jël depaar:** This refers to the departure times of buses, not a convenient option *to get to* a bus stop.
* **B: Jënd ab tiket ci njëlbéen:** This is about buying tickets, not the transport itself.
* **C: Kaar yu bari dañuy depaar ci bis bi yépp:** This speaks about buses departing early, not helping a tourist reach a bus stop.



"
Ban ci yile mo nekkul luy tax ñu xam Tombouctou?,"The correct answer is **A: Moo ëppale influence Arab li des ci réew mi** (It has a strong Arab influence that stands out in the country).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dëkk bii wuutena lool ay yeneen dëkk yi ci réew, ndax dëkku arab la gëna nuru dëkku Afrique."" (The city is very different from other cities in the country, as it's an Arab city among African cities.) This directly supports the idea of a strong Arab influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Neew doole la (It's newly built):** The passage says it *used* to be new, but that's not its defining characteristic now.
* **C: Roplaan mënu fa dem (Many people come to visit):** While the passage mentions tourism, it's not the primary thing that makes Tombouctou notable.
* **D: Dafay wey di xëcc touriste yi (It has a lot of help from tourists):** The passage says tourists contribute to its economy, but doesn't imply it *relies* on them.



"
Ban ci yile jëf ci li àju ci Tombouctou mooy dëgg?,"The correct answer is **B: Moo gëna exotik kë luñu neewal doole**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tey, Timbuktu ab gox bu neew doole la, donte niñ ko xàmee mooy tax mu doon luy xëcc turist yi, te dafa am aydapoor."" This translates to ""Indeed, Timbuktu is a very rare jewel, the reason people come to see it is its unique character that attracts tourists, and it has a distinct atmosphere.""  This directly speaks to its exotic and unique nature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mën nañu dem ci dëkk bi ak roplaan:** (People come to the city with plans) - While people *do* come with plans, the passage doesn't emphasize this as the main characteristic.
* **C: Amul flair bu bari suñ ko mengalee ay dëkk yi ko wër:** (It has a strong flair that makes it resemble other cities) - The passage emphasizes its *uniqueness* not its similarity to other cities.
* **D: Dëkk mënatul xëcc ay touriste:** (The city is meant to welcome tourists) - While it attracts tourists, the passage doesn't say the city *exists* solely to welcome them.  It has a deeper history and character.



"
Kañ lañu njëkka waajal Jeux Olympiques yu été bi? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ut 2021**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Powu way laago yi dina am ci 24 Ut ba ci 5 Septumbar 2021."" This translates to ""The games took place from July 24th to September 5th, 2021.""  Therefore, the Olympics happened in July 2021.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mars 2020** - The text mentions March 2020 as when political issues arose *due to* the coronavirus, delaying the games, but not when they took place.
*   **C: Sàttumbar 2021** -  While the games *ended* in September, they began in July.
*   **D: Sulet 2020** - The text explicitly says the games were originally *scheduled* for 2020 but were delayed."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban jamono la ab seggukaay di doon ab tornade?","The correct answer is **A: Su ngalaw àggee ci lu jefe 100 mile ci waxtu wu nekk**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dañuy defa ngelaw yu ab doole(yen saay 100-200 miles/waxtu wu nekk)..."" which translates to ""These are strong winds (around 100-200 miles/hour)..."" This directly links strong winds to the formation of tornadoes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sunu kolonu ngelaw yi tambalee turné:** (What color are the winds when they turn) - The passage doesn't mention wind color.
* **C: Soo wàccee ci nuage yu orage bi:** (What is seen in storm clouds) - While tornadoes are *associated* with storm clouds, the passage focuses on wind speed as a key factor.
* **D: So laalee suuf si ba noppi:** (What is seen when it is quiet) - This is unrelated to tornado formation.



"
Ban ci yile mooy ab melokaanu tornage bu jub?,"The correct answer is **A: Dañuy sos ay ngelawi 100 ba 200 miles ci waxtu wu nekk** (They travel 100 to 200 miles in a day).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dañuy defa ngelaw yu ab doole(yen saay 100-200 miles/waxtu wu nekk)..."" This directly translates to ""They travel the tornados that are many (around 100-200 miles/per day)...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dañuy faral di dem ak ay yëf yu diis** (They are connected with strong winds) - While strong winds are *associated* with tornadoes, the passage doesn't state this is *how much* they travel.
* **C: Dañuy doon ay seggukaay laata ñuy laal suuf si** (They are seeking cool air) - The passage mentions they go toward the land, but not specifically for cool air.
* **D: Ay kolon yuy wër lañuy yuy puus ngelaw li ci biti** (Some colors are brighter when near a tornado) - This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci fan la ab tukkikat wara amee tektal ci li aju ci anamu polotik ci gox buñu jëm?","The correct answer is **B: Bawoo ci gisiin yu nekk ci xalaatu tukkikat yi** (Focus on the issues related to the problems of migrants).

Here's why:

* **The passage primarily discusses the challenges faced by migrants (tukkikat):** It talks about healthcare access, discrimination, and the difficulties of integrating into a new country.  The author highlights issues like healthcare coverage, cultural differences, and the political implications of migration.
* **The question asks about the core focus of the text.** The text isn't about general national sentiment (A & D) or simply who lives in the country (C). It's specifically about the *problems* migrants face.
* **""Xalaatu tukkikat yi""** directly translates to ""problems of migrants"" and captures the essence of the passage.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bawoo ci nguuru réew mi di nañ la seetsi (Focus on the national sentiment of the country):**  While the passage touches on political implications, it doesn't center on overall national feeling.
* **C: Bawoo ci ñi dëkk ci réew mi ñuy dem (Focus on those who live in the country who have arrived):** This is too broad. The text is about *the issues they face* not just their existence.
* **D: Ci seen nguuru bopp (On all national issues):** The passage is very specifically focused on one set of issues - those impacting migrants.



"
"Su amee ab tektalu tukki, lan la ab doomu réew warul dundu?","The correct answer is **B: Tëŋk buñu yombal anamu polotiku réew mi** (It's mostly about the country's political policies).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wax sa xalaat yi ab tëngk la rekk ci nekkinu politik bu ab réew."" This translates to ""These situations are mostly linked to the country's political policies.""  The entire paragraph discusses how access to healthcare (and thus, the need for health insurance or social security) is heavily influenced by where someone is *from* and the political climate of those countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Asiransu fomm buñu konselé** (Social security insurance is mostly counseling) - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Asiransu wergu-yaram buñu laal** (Health insurance is mostly important) - While healthcare *is* important, the passage focuses on *access* determined by political factors.
* **D: Ay xibaar yu leer yu àju ci anamu polotiku réew mi** (These issues are complex and related to the country's political policies) - While true, option B is more direct and captures the *main* point the author is making.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu tukki moo warul laaj ndimbalu jàpp ci ab tukkikat?","The correct answer is **A: Ab tukki jëm ci ab ndajem liggéey ci ab gox bi nga xamne tukkikat bi demoon na fa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the difficulty of finding good accommodations (tukki) that fit a budget.** It mentions agencies not having the best options (""yeneen agence yuy yëngu ci yenn xeeti tukki yi, njëgg yi wala jëmuwaay yi"") and the need to search extensively (""Mën na gënna baax nga gis ab aseng bu tàmm di jàppalaate tukki yi niroog seen bos."").
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Accommodations are found with difficulty based on the quality you are looking for"" perfectly reflects the challenge described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ab tukkib ñaari ayu-bis ci ab budget bu xejjiku lool** (Accommodations are often expensive based on a small budget) - While budget is mentioned, the core issue isn't *just* expensiveness, it's the *difficulty finding* something suitable.
* **C: Ab tukki buy feeñ ci ab bariyeeru lakk** (Accommodations are quickly taken in popular locations) -  While this might be true, the passage doesn't focus on speed of booking, but on finding *quality* options.
* **D: Tukkib ab tukkikat bu njëkk ci bitim-réew** (Accommodations are often different in foreign countries) - This is a general statement and doesn't relate to the specific problem described in the text.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes difficulties finding suitable lodging (tukki) – specifically, a good quality one (xarnu bi) that isn't too expensive.** The author mentions issues with agencies not having the right options (""tukki yi, njëgg yi wala jëmuwaay yi"") and needing to search extensively (""gis ab aseng bu tàmm di jàppalaate tukki yi"").
* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Su tukkikat bi nekkee ci japp volu dem ak dikk gir dem seen dëkku cosaan"" translates to ""Finding lodging is difficult and takes a lot of effort to find something within your means.""  This perfectly reflects the problem outlined in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** Focuses on a ""good place to stay"" which isn't the core issue - it's *finding* a good place.
* **C:** Mentions countries which isn't the central topic.
* **D:** Talks about being in a bad neighborhood, which is not discussed in the passage.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mo wara tax ab tukkikat mëna moytu suy dem ci ay barab yu bees?","The correct answer is **A: Xaar ay baxoo yu ni mel niki fuñu bawoo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a situation where someone is preparing a shop (dëkk) for opening.** They are stocking it with various goods – fabrics, salt, sugar, etc.  The overall goal is to *prepare* the shop for customers.
* **Question (Q) asks about what someone might do to attract customers to a newly opened shop.**
* **Option A (""Xaar ay baxoo yu ni mel niki fuñu bawoo"" - ""To offer good prices that attract people"") directly addresses this by suggesting offering good prices to draw in customers.** This aligns with the preparation described in the passage and the goal of making the shop successful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bëgg-bëggu ñam ay lekk yuñu tamul (""Begging for people to buy sugar"")** - This is illogical and not a sustainable business strategy.
* **C: Dugg ci yenn yoon yu mel ni fi ñu bawoo (""To lie about good things so they buy"")** -  Dishonesty is not a good way to build a customer base.
* **D: Moytu ay gëstug njëlbéen ci dalaukaay bi (""To make gestures of welcome at the doorway"")** - While welcoming is good, it's not the primary driver of business; price and quality are more important.



Therefore, **A** is the most logical and relevant answer to the question, given the context of the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban xeetu nit moo wara dundu mbeteel suy tukki ci barab bumu xamul?","The correct answer is **B: Kenn ku bëgg coppite**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** describes a situation where someone is trying to understand why things aren't going well in their business (the ""dëkk"" - shop). They list various problems: lack of sales, difficult customers, problems with supplies, etc. They are seeking a solution to improve things.
* **The Question (Q)** asks what kind of help people often seek when their business is struggling.
* **""Coppite""** in Wolof refers to a marabout or spiritual healer.  People often turn to marabouts for blessings, advice, and solutions when facing business difficulties, believing spiritual factors might be at play.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kenn ku bëgg ay ñam yu bawoo fu sori:** This means ""someone who asks for good advice,"" while good advice is helpful, it doesn't specifically address the context of business problems that might be perceived as having a spiritual component.
* **C: Kenn ku bëgg xalaatam tëju:** This means ""someone who seeks a fair judge."" While legal issues *could* affect a business, it's not the first recourse people generally take for everyday business troubles.
* **D: Kenn ku bëgg jang:** This means ""someone who seeks war."" This is completely irrelevant to the context of trying to improve a business.



Therefore, **B: Kenn ku bëgg coppite** is the most logical answer, reflecting a common practice in the described cultural context."
Ban ci yile tektal lañu digëlul tukkikat yi ngir ñu dem ci réew mu am koom ci yoon bu njëkk?,"The correct answer is **A: Xam allu mala bi ci dëkk bi laata ngay tëdd ci suuf.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sudee dangeen nekk ci dëkk bu ngeen xamul lu bari ci àllam, moytu leen tëdd ci matelas wala coussin ci suuf.""  This translates to: ""Sometimes they find themselves in a cheap hotel, they put them to sleep on mattresses or cushions on the floor."" This directly addresses the question of where they sleep when they arrive in a new country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moytu def ay yëfi dof ci lekk bi ci say bis yu jëkk:** This talks about offering hot drinks in expensive hotels, which isn't mentioned in the passage as a common practice for these travelers.
* **C: Ab lalu liir lañuy digle sooy def camping ci biti:** This refers to camping, which isn't the primary accommodation described.
* **D: Dugal sa loxo ci ab otel bu baax sooy njëkka aksi:** This talks about spending money in good hotels, which contradicts the description of ""cheap hotels"" (dëkk bu ngeen).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...xalaatal ngay joxe xaalis bu bari ci feem wu Sowu ak **otel yu baax yi**, lekk, ak farata yi...""  This directly translates to ""...often find good accommodations in the form of Sowu and **good hotels**, beds, and facilities...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lekk yu bawoo soowu** (Beds made of straw) - While beds are mentioned, they are not the main focus of the comfortable accommodations.
*   **B: Baaxaayu sàrwiis yi** (Good services) - Services are implied with hotels, but the hotels themselves are the direct answer.
*   **C: Ab matla wala ab cousing ngir dem camping** (Mats or cushions for camping) - This refers to a simpler, less luxurious option mentioned for those wanting a very basic experience, not the comfortable accommodations being discussed.

"Yan ci yile tànnéef ñooy doon li gën ci ñi yore sàrt te bëgg ab sotti bu virtuel bu seen polotik, te baña mëna jot ci internet?","The correct answer is **C: Teye ab sotti buñu deñc ci seen memuwaaru prdinatëër portaabal** (They should save a copy on their portable computer memory).

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) explicitly states:** ""Su fekkee dangay tukki ak ordinatër wala tablet, dncal ab kopi c dnckaayam wal disk( nga mën c jot te nekkoo ci lënd gi)."" This translates to ""You should save it on your computer or tablet, also save a copy on a USB drive (which you can write and take with you on the land).""  This directly relates to saving a copy on a portable computer's memory (like a USB drive or the computer itself).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Joxe ab soti wu këru tukki bi:** (They should shout that they have taken it) - Completely irrelevant to the passage.
* **B: Yonnanté ci seen biir ay imel:** (They should send it by email) - While the passage mentions email as an option for submitting, it doesn’t suggest this is *how* to save the copy.
* **D: Deñc ab sotti ci “niir” bi:** (They should save it on “the cloud”) - The passage mentions the “cloud” as a possible submission method, but again, doesn’t say to *save* the copy there.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the advice given in passage P."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile lañu warul wone ci sàrt bi?","The correct answer is **A: Nimero telefon yi ci bitim-réew ngir def ay càkkutéef** (Phone numbers of local contacts for making claims).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""ak nimero telefon bitim réew ngir digal/sañ-sañ ak laaj yelleef.""  This translates to ""and local phone numbers for claims/assistance and benefits.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** What should be included in the document, particularly useful when traveling?  Local phone numbers for claims are the most relevant for that scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adares imelu asirekat bi** (Private email address) - While an email is mentioned, it's for sending copies, not the primary thing being *included* for easy access during travel.
* **C: Ay nimero telefon internationaux ngir nangu yi** (International phone numbers for help) - The passage focuses on *local* numbers for claims.
* **D: Aderess imelu kiy jël asirans bi** (Insurance company's email address) - Again, the passage emphasizes numbers for *direct contact* in case of need, not contacting the insurance company directly.

"Sunu sukandikoo ci xët bi, ban dayoo bu bo moo mengook tëggiinu filmu buñuy jëfandikoo lu gëna bari?","The correct answer is **A: 6 x 6 cm negatif**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amna yenn aparey foto argentik yuy jël formaa bu yam ci 6 x 6 cm, ci gàttal négatif yu 56 x 56 mm."" This directly indicates that a 6 x 6 cm negative format was used by some silver (argentik) cameras.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 56 x 56 mm negatif:** While mentioned, this is *within* the 6x6 format, not the overall format itself.
*   **C: 35 mm negatif:** The text describes 35mm as the *standard* but focuses on another format being used.
*   **D: 36 x 24 mm negatif:** This is a specific size *within* the 35mm format, not a different format altogether.



"
Yan ci yile tëgginu filmu ñooy joxe ab tëraliin bu nirook ab DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Filmu 35 mm**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Formaa film yi bari nañu lool waaye bi ci nit ñi gëna yàgga jëfandikoo mooy bu yam bu 35 mm..."" (The most common film format used by most photographers is the standard 35 mm...).
* **The question asks:** Which film is most often used with DSLR cameras?
* **DSLRs historically used 35mm film:** While digital, DSLRs evolved *from* 35mm film cameras.  They share the same frame size and lens mount compatibility (often).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Filmu tëggiin bu yem:** This is too vague. ""Tëggiin bu yem"" means ""small film"" and doesn't specify a size.
* **C: Filmu 56 x 56 mm:**  This is the negative size for the 6x6 format, not the film itself generally used with DSLRs.
* **D: Filmu 6 x 6 cm:**  This is a medium format film, less commonly associated with the historical development/compatibility of DSLRs.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** discusses the desire to create a blog that is easy to use and accessible to people, especially those who aren't tech-savvy. It wants to help people share their thoughts online.
* **Q (the question)** asks what's a good solution for making online content accessible to a wider audience, particularly those with limited tech skills.
* **Option B** directly addresses this: ""Provide easy tools for anyone to create their own blog easily.""  This aligns perfectly with the goal of making blogging accessible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Def tëggiinu web (Improve the web):**  Too broad. While a nice goal, it doesn't directly address the accessibility issue.
* **C: Defar sa daluwebu bopp (Improve existing websites):**  Focuses on *existing* websites, not enabling *new* content creators.
* **D: Ñawal sa xarañtéef ci wàllu bind (Learn to code):**  This is the opposite of what the passage wants! The passage aims to help people *without* needing to code.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and relevant answer."
"Sooy tambali ab këru bind tukku, yan man-man nga wara njëkka ñoŋal?","The correct answer is **A: Def blogging**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** describes someone wanting to create a website/blog to share their thoughts and ideas. It talks about reaching people online and making their voice heard.
* **Q (the question)** asks what this activity is called – creating and maintaining an online platform to share content.
* **Def blogging** (meaning ""to blog"" in Wolof) directly corresponds to the description in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tëggum Web** (Web Development) – While building a website *is* involved, the passage focuses on the *content creation* and *sharing* aspect, not the technical building.
* **C: Soppi** (Shopping) –  Irrelevant to the passage's content.
* **D: Sos daluweb** (Web Search) –  About *finding* information online, not *creating* and *sharing* it.



"
Ci ban xeetu climat lañuy gis ay jafe-jafe ci wàllu buit?,"The correct answer is **C: Kilimaa yu tang** (Tropical climates).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ne jafe-jafe noyyi ci kilimaa yu sedd yi, jafe-jafe biir ci kilimaa yu tàng yi tamit barina te ci kaa yu bare dañoo sonnalaate wante nekkul lu mëna loraate.""  This translates to: ""If illnesses are common in cool climates, illnesses are more frequent in tropical climates, especially in hot and humid areas where sanitation is poor.""

Therefore, tropical climates are linked to a higher incidence of these illnesses (jafe-jafe).



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ab exposition buy sax mën na waral immunité wu lan?","The correct answer is **C: Ay jafe-jafey nooyi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses ""jafe-jafe nooyi"" (new illnesses)** and how exposure to them can build immunity.  It states that encountering these illnesses, even if unpleasant, can lead to lasting protection (""...ci kaa yu bare dañoo sonnalaate wante nekkul lu mëna loraate"" - even bad experiences can lead to future protection).
* **A: Jafe-jafey butit (old illnesses)** - The text contrasts new illnesses with the familiar ones, implying immunity to the old ones is already present.
* **B: Ay germe yu ci dëkk bi (germs in the market)** - This is too specific and doesn't represent the overall point about building immunity.
* **D: Biiru Delhi (Delhi Belly)** -  Delhi Belly is an *example* of an illness, not the thing that builds immunity.



"
Ban ci yile mooy ab awantaasu tukki ci barabu Schengen ?,"The correct answer is **A: Moytu bindu ci ay wisa yu bari** (They can travel with valid visas).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...tukki ci ay réew yu bari mën naa doon wara dem wuti ji ay wisa ak paspoor ay yoon yu bari.""  This translates to ""...in certain countries, you need a visa and a valid passport to travel.""
* **The question asks:** What advantage is there to being in the Schengen area?
* The Schengen area allows travel *with* the proper documentation (visas and passports).  It doesn't *give* you a visa, but simplifies travel *if* you have one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sakkanal xaalis (Paying taxes):**  The passage doesn't mention taxes.
* **C: Moytu ay saytug passpoor yu bari (Having valid passports):** While having a valid passport is necessary, it's not the *advantage* of being in Schengen – a visa is also often needed.
* **D: Soxawul benn passpoor (Having one passport):**  The passage doesn't relate to the number of passports someone has.



"
Lan lañu mënatul gis ci bameelu Toutankhamon?,"The correct answer is **B: Boppu momie bi** (The contents of the mummy's coffin).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Képp ku bëggoon a gis firnde yàqu yàqu bu am ci momi bi, ba ñu kay jeemma genne ci kees gi seen yaakaar dina tass ndax bopp bi ak mbagg yi rekk ñoo doon feeñ."" This translates to: ""They found a lot of beautiful things inside the mummy, and they carefully removed them to study them because only the coffin and the bandages were left.""

This directly refers to what was found *inside* the mummy's coffin - the contents.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay dekorasioŋ (Decorations):** While the tomb *had* decorations, the question asks what was found *inside* the mummy's burial.
*   **C: Mbaggi momie bi (The mummy's bandages):** The text specifically states the bandages were *left* behind, so they weren't what was being discovered.
*   **D: Borom alal yi (Important people):** The text is about objects found with the mummy, not people.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci jëmuwaayu Vancouver mooy doon bul xëcc lu bari ngir tukkikat yuy xalaat njëg yi? ","The correct answer is **C: Duunu Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes Bowen Island as a place to go for a weekend: ""Bowen Island bisu tukki la wala dem wikenu..."". It details activities available there like kayaking, hiking, restaurants, and getting there by ferry or water taxi. The question asks about a destination near Vancouver for a weekend getaway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duunu Granville:** Granville Island is *in* Vancouver, not a getaway *from* Vancouver.  The passage mentions it as a place *in* Vancouver.
* **B: Kuluwaaru Géej jëm Asamaan:** This refers to a trail in Cypress Mountain, a hiking spot, but isn't presented as a comprehensive weekend destination.
* **D: Siflekat:**  This isn't mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, Bowen Island (Duunu Bowen) is the most appropriate answer based on the text.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bowen Island bisu tukki la wala dem wikenu bu siiw bi ngay mëna defee ay kayak, yeek ci montaañ, jënd, dem ci ay restoran ak yeneen."" This translates to ""Bowen Island is a great place to go on weekends for those who like kayaking, hiking, eating, and relaxing.""  The passage then describes it as a nearby escape from Vancouver.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mbiip:** This term doesn't appear in the passage.
* **C: Downtown Vancouver:** While the passage mentions Vancouver, it presents Bowen Island *as an alternative* to being *in* downtown Vancouver.
* **D: Duunu Granville:** Granville Island is mentioned, but as a place *within* Vancouver, not a weekend getaway.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, kañ la tukkikat yi wara dem ci Chutes yi suñuy wut ay vues yu sori?","The correct answer is **A: Nowambar ba Màrs**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ci jamonoy nawet (nowàmbre ba màrs), ndox mi dafay gêna yokk suko defee wall gi di gëna mëna lore.""  This translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the spray from the falls is at its highest and most spectacular.""  This directly answers the question about when the views are the most impressive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci saison wu touriste yi (During the tourist season):** While it's likely a tourist season, the text focuses on the *rainy season* and its impact on the views, not the tourist season itself.
* **C: Su dayoob ndox mi baree (When the falls are widest):** The text doesn't mention the width of the falls, only the spray.
* **D: Suñu génnée ci saison taw yi (When it is generated in the dry season):** The text specifically says the best views are during the *rainy* season, not the dry season.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan mooy awantaasu dem ci Chutes yu Victoria digante Nowambar ak Màrs?","The correct answer is **D: Moytu saison wu taw** (The rainy season).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ci jamonoy nawet (nowàmbre ba màrs), ndox mi dafay gêna yokk suko defee wall gi di gëna mëna lore."" This translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water is very abundant, almost filling the entire gorge.""

Therefore, the question ""What happens at Victoria Falls between November and March?"" is best answered by stating it's the rainy season, leading to high water levels.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vues yuñu mënul jël ci Chutes yi** (Views that are rarely seen at the Falls) - The text doesn't say the views are rare, just that the water is high.
*   **B: Touriste yu neew** (New tourists) - The text mentions tourists, but doesn't focus on new ones.
*   **C: Vue yu doywaar ci Chutes yi** (Views that are different at the Falls) - While the view *is* different, the key aspect described is the *reason* for the difference – the rainy season.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile lañu diglewul suñuy jefandikoo ab drône ngir filmé?","The correct answer is **D: Filme ci ay barab yu bari nit kese fuñu dul mëna raññee drône yi** (Film in areas where people are not present or where drone flight is permitted).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes safety and respecting others.** It mentions the need to be careful with drones, avoiding populated areas, and being mindful of potential disturbances.  The passage highlights the importance of not disturbing people with drone filming.
* **Options A, B, and C are too narrow.** While needing a good reason to film (A) or potentially needing licenses/permits (B & C) might be true in some contexts, the *primary* concern expressed in the text is where you film – avoiding causing problems for others.

Therefore, option D best reflects the core message of the passage regarding responsible drone use for filming.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, yan barab ñoo gën barab ngir filmé sooy jëfandikoo ab drône?","The correct answer is **D: Ci barab yi nga amee permi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Di nawal bénn drone ci wétu aydapor wala ci kaw ay nit xalaat bu bon la daanaka, donté téréwugnuko ci sad eek.""  This translates to ""...It's forbidden to fly drones in populated areas or near people who could be disturbed, therefore it's necessary to have permission for that.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ci wetu mbooloo yu teewaayu drône yi dul dérangé:** (In places where drones often bother people) - While true, the passage doesn't say *this* is the reason for needing permission.
* **B: Ci barab yi nga xamantane dañuy nangu ñu jël fa ay foto yu bari:** (In places where people want to take beautiful photos) - Irrelevant to the passage's focus on regulations.
* **C: Ci barab yu fees yi nga xamantane drône duñu yomba gis:** (In open spaces where drones can easily register) - Doesn't address the need for permission due to potential disturbance.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban wax bu àju ci bindug càkkutéef ngir defar visa mooy dëgg?","The correct answer is **A: So dalee ci ay barabi dëkkuwaayi touriste, mën nga baña soxla bindu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ci yeneeni kaa, ñooñu di dés ci fi turist yi di dal ñoo soxla bindu."" (In many cases, they allow tourists to easily obtain visas.) This directly answers the question of what is commonly done to get a visa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Réew yépp dañuy laaj bindu ci nguur yi ci dëkk bi:**  The passage doesn't say all countries make it easy to get a visa in their cities.
* **C: Mën nañu la laaj nga dem ci biro imigrasioŋ yi:** While the passage mentions going to immigration offices, it doesn't say it's *easy* – just that it's a place to apply.
* **D: Ci yenn barab yi, otel yi ci dëkk bi di nañu mëna toppatoo bindu gi:** This refers to hotels helping with visa support (specifically for business travelers), not the general process of getting a visa.



"
Ban ci yile moo nekkul ab barab bu ab touriste wara dem ngir toppatoo bindu wam?,"The correct answer is **B: Otel buñu dal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Ci réew yu bari yu am yoon buni mel, otel yu nekk ci barab bi dina ñu toppatoo bindu gi (fexel ba laaj).""  This translates to: ""In countries with a visa requirement, hotels in the area often handle the visa application (especially for tourists).""

The question (Q) asks where tourists can go to apply for a visa. The passage directly identifies hotels as a place where this can be done.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ab poliis bu nekk ci dëkk bi (The police station in the city):** The passage doesn't mention police stations handling visas.
* **C: Ab biro post bu nekk ci dëkk bii (The post office in the city):** The passage doesn't mention post offices handling visas.
* **D: Biroimigrasioŋ yi (Immigration offices):** While immigration offices *do* handle visas, the passage specifically highlights hotels as a common place for tourists to *begin* the process.



"
Kan moodul jariñoo ci vonlontariat suy tukki?,"The correct answer is **A: Kenn ku yaakaar mêna am ay xarit bitim-réew** (People who want to help and have resources for countries in need).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes a desire to help people, particularly those in need (""nit yu bees,"" ""sa bopp"").** It mentions wanting to understand problems and offer support.
* **Option A** directly reflects this desire to help countries in need (""ay xarit bitim-réew"") and implies having the means to do so (""yaakaar mêna"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kenn kuy wut ab payoor bu am solo** (People who are rich and have individual means) - While resources are helpful, the passage focuses on *helping others*, not just being wealthy.  The passage isn't about individual wealth, but collective support.
* **C: Kenn ku yaakaara am xarañtéef bu bees** (People who want to have a lot of influence) - The passage doesn't mention a desire for influence or power. It's about compassion and aid.
* **D: Kenn ku néeg ak bitim-réew soxal** (People who are connected to and sociable with countries in need) - Connection isn't the primary motivation described in the passage. It's the *desire to help* that drives the speaker.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate reflection of the passage's central theme of wanting to engage in helping those less fortunate."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, nan la volontariat so nekkee bitim-réew amee njariñ ci tukkikat yu seen budget bariwul?","The correct answer is **A: Dañuy joxe ab saleer mën ñu wax saa su nekk** (They often say that this is what happens).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) discusses the downsides of development and aid.** It talks about how aid can sometimes worsen situations (""jàppale googu warul yam ci joxe kese"" - aid often makes things worse), create dependence, and not truly address the root problems. It highlights the negative consequences for the people receiving aid.
* **The question (Q) asks about the problems with volunteering and aid budgets.** It's asking about a negative outcome related to aid.
* **Option A directly reflects the sentiment of the passage.** It acknowledges the often-unspoken truth that aid doesn't always work as intended and can sometimes be harmful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dafay tax li ci ëpp nga am ay wërsëgi liggéey** (It's often the case that there are problems with the rules) - This is too general and doesn't specifically address the issues with aid *effectiveness* as highlighted in the passage.
* **C: Yenn saay dañuy joxe néeg ak sangokaay** (Often people talk about problems and solutions) -  Also too general. The passage focuses on *specific* negative consequences, not just talk about problems.
* **D: Mën na la jàppale nga am mëna am beneen gis-gis** (We have aid that has little impact on the truly needy) - While the passage *implies* this, option A is a more direct response to the question about the *problems* with aid.  Option D states an outcome, A discusses the underlying issue.



Therefore, **A** is the best answer because it aligns most closely with the critical view of aid presented in the passage."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan lañuy jappee lu atypique ci tukki bu yemaay ci Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **A: Def ab ayu-bis di xuus ci biir park yi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tukki “bunimél” lajna dém ci aydaporu Orlando, dém ci bénn keeruk noppalu kaayu Disney, déffa bénn sémén té doo génn foofu, té déllu sa keer."" This translates to ""The 'special' package includes travel to Orlando, staying in Disney's very nice hotels, with meals and drinks included, and transportation.""  This specifically mentions *hotels* and *meals* within the Disney parks – essentially, all-inclusive aspects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nekk ci ab otel bu nekkul ci site bi:** While the package *includes* a hotel, it doesn't say it's specifically *outside* the site. It's Disney's hotels *within* the Disney area.
* **C: Nekk ci moomeelu Disney ci tukki bi yépp:** The text mentions Disney experiences, but doesn't highlight that as a *unique* feature of the package.
* **D: Jël ab kaar bawoo ci aydapoor bi dem ci otel bi:**  The text discusses transportation *to* the hotel/parks, not specifically moving around within Orlando once you’re there.



"
Ban ci yile kàddu yu àju ci Walt Disney World moo nekkul dëgg?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiketi tukki yu bari yi mën nañ leen gis li ci ëpp ci daluwebi vente aux enchères yi** (Tickets for trips are often found on online auction websites).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Billet yu bari yuñ jaay ci site en ligne yiy def anchere lu ci melni eBay wala Craigslist yooyu ay billet parc-hopper yu xawa yàgg lañu te xaw nañu leen jëfandikoo.""  This translates to ""Trip tickets are often found on online sites with auctions like eBay or Craigslist, especially park-hopper tickets which can be found cheaper.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While park-hopper tickets *are* mentioned, the passage doesn't say they are the main difficulty. It says they are *found* on auction sites, implying that's how to get them cheaper.
* **B:** The passage doesn't discuss general travel difficulties.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention any transportation services for trips.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile mbir lañu dul toppatoo ci ab kalaasu taggatu ngir am liggéey wala ci ay siiwal?","The correct answer is **C: Waajal barabu geer bi** (Dealing with dangerous behavior).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a course on dealing with a ""hostile environment.""** It specifically mentions preparing for situations where someone might experience harassment or aggression (""ay jaar-jaar yu andak jëf"").
* **The passage emphasizes recognizing and responding to problematic behavior** (""benn lesoŋ war na mëna ŋàŋk jafe-jafe yuñu waxtaanee fii ci ay leeral yu gëna ma"").
* **The course aims to equip people with the skills to navigate difficult and potentially dangerous interactions.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dundu ci barabu sauvage (Living in a wild environment):** While the environment *could* be described as hostile, the focus is on *people's* behavior, not survival in the wilderness.
* **B: Waajal secours yu njëkk yi (First aid techniques):**  First aid is helpful, but not the primary focus of a course on a hostile environment.  The passage is about *preventing* escalation and handling *behavior*.
* **D: Jouer benn rôle (Playing a role):**  This doesn't relate to the content of the passage at all.



"
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban ci yile tomb lañu gëna mëna def ci ab kalaasu tàggatu ngir am liggéey?","The correct answer is **D: Barab yu hostile yi** (Hostile environments).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions a ""Hostile environment course""** and discusses creating a safe and respectful work environment.  The whole point is addressing issues related to hostile behaviors and ensuring people feel safe.
* The passage describes negative behaviors (""jafe-jafe yuñu waxtaanee"") and the need to address them, which directly relates to a hostile work environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Secours yu njëkk (First aid)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Barabu geer bi (Workplace)** - While the passage *takes place* in a workplace, the focus isn't simply on work, but on making it *safe* from hostility.
* **C: Dundaat ci barab bu sowaas (Good workplace practices)** -  This is related, but the passage specifically focuses on *preventing* negative, hostile environments, not just general good practices.



"
"Sunu sukkandiko ci xët bi, lan mooy tànnéef bi gën ngir moytu ndox mu ñu jàpp ni dafa am doomu jangoro?","The correct answer is **A: Baxal ndox ay simili**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage)** talks about the *challenges* and *difficulties* (ndox) that people face in life. It mentions both current hardships and past ones, and the importance of learning from those experiences to navigate future ones. It emphasizes that struggles (""ndox"") are common to everyone (""yenn galaangkoor yi"").  The passage also talks about overcoming hardships and finding strength.
* **Q (the question)** asks about the *main idea* of the text regarding hardship. It specifically asks about *why* people suffer.
* **A (Baxal ndox ay simili)** translates to ""Hardships are similar."" This perfectly captures the core message of the passage: that everyone experiences difficulties, and those difficulties are a common part of the human experience.  The passage illustrates this by saying hardships are common to all people (""yenn galaangkoor yi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jënd ndox yuñuy def ci biteel:**  This translates to ""Hardships often arise from mistakes."" While mistakes *can* cause hardship, the passage doesn't focus on the *source* of the hardship, but rather the *experience* of it.
* **C: Baxal ndox diiru benn simili:** This translates to ""Hardships last for a short time."" The passage doesn't say hardships are short-lived. It acknowledges both past and present difficulties.
* **D: Xayma ndox mi ngir ay fitna yu xejjiku:** This translates to ""Hardships are opportunities for dangerous trials."" While hardship can *lead* to trials, the passage doesn't present them *as* opportunities, and doesn't mention danger.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate reflection of the passage's main idea."
"Suniu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, lan moo wara nekk lu xawa mëna nekk ba ci feeykat yu gëna xarañ?","The correct answer is **D: Feey ci wetu vagues yi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) heavily discusses waves (""vague"").** It talks about their shape, how they break, and the dangers they pose. The passage describes a situation where someone is caught in waves and struggling.
* **The question (Q) asks where the situation described in the text is likely happening.** Given the focus on waves, the most logical place would be *in the waves*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Feey ci wetu récifs yi (In the reefs):**  While reefs can *create* waves, the passage doesn't focus on reefs themselves, but the waves' action.
* **B: Feey ci ndo mu xóot (In deep water):** The passage mentions ""ndox yu xóot"" (deep waters) as a *characteristic* of where the waves form, but the immediate danger is being *in* the waves.
* **C: Feey jakkarlook courant yi (In strong currents):** Currents are mentioned as a potential consequence of the situation, but the primary focus remains on the waves.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and directly supported by the text."
Lan nga wara def su la courant jàppee?,"The correct answer is **C: Feey ci beneen jubluwaay bi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states:** ""Jeema dem ci bërëb bi nga xamanteni duun lafa jaapat wala, ci say mëneef la aju ak su fekke xame nañula, da nga bëgga xaar ngir rëcc.""  This translates to ""People go to the shore, sometimes to swim or just to cool off and relax, and sometimes to fish.""
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""What do people usually do in the current?"" (referring to the sea current)
* **Option C (""Feey ci beneen jubluwaay bi"" - ""They swim in the current"")** directly aligns with the passage's description of people going to the shore *to swim*.  The passage implies the current is where people swim.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jéema génn ci courant bi di jël beneen jubluwaay, te feey ci tefes bu baax bi (""People go into the current to watch the swimmers, and swim in the good waves."")** - The passage doesn't mention watching swimmers, it focuses on people *being* the swimmers.
* **B: Feey ci lu gaaw jakaarlook courant bi (""They swim in the salty water of the current."")** - Salinity isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Feey ci kaw surface bi (""They swim on the surface."")** - While people likely swim *on* the surface, this isn't what the passage highlights; it emphasizes swimming *in* the current as the activity.

"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban barab la wisitu ab chateau mênee doon ab génnug wakans bu am solo?","The correct answer is **D: Ci wetu ab yoonu xuus ci ndox mi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""P: Yoon yu bato yi aak gaal yi mën a jaar mën nañu doon tem bu baax ngir tëral ci ay wakaans."" (Traveling by boat is a great way to discover places.) and then lists examples like Loire Valley, Rhine Valley, Danube River, and Erie Canal.  It further says ""Dañoo teg ay yoon ngir doxantu gu siiw ak dawalukaayu welo."" (There are many opportunities for quiet contemplation and leisurely travel).
* **The question (Q) asks:** ""Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ci ban barab la wisitu ab chateau mênee doon ab génnug wakans bu am solo?"" (What is suggested in the text, for people who want to visit chateaus and have a unique experience?)
* **Option D** directly reflects the idea of finding unique experiences and contemplation mentioned in the text by saying ""Ci wetu ab yoonu xuus ci ndox mi"" (In the search for unusual experiences).  The passage *implies* this is a good way to find such experiences through boat travel and visiting places like chateaus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ab dëkk biir Danube:** The Danube is *mentioned* but doesn't specifically relate to the unique experience aspect.
* **B: Ci wetu Erie Canal:** Same as A - it's a place mentioned but doesn't address the ""unique experience"" part of the question.
* **C: Ci Vallée du Rhin:** Same as A and B - a location, but not the core idea of the question.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes people who are very concerned with appearances and social standing.** They care about how others perceive them (""wute ci wàllum cosaan mën naa waral liñuy mëna jàppee"") and meticulously present themselves (""ñu teye ko ci loxo, ak yeneen"").
* **Option B directly addresses this preoccupation with social image and the desire to be seen as respectable (""ab doxaliin bu metti bu bawoo"").** It connects this to their behavior and how they present themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baña waxtaane ay etat civil (They are only concerned with civil status):** While social status is important, the passage goes beyond just marital status. It's about overall social perception.
* **C: Moytu sol ay takkaay yuy takk (They only tell stories):** Storytelling isn't the central theme of the passage; it's the *presentation* of self.
* **D: Wone dëgër su ko laajee (They want to make it easier):** This doesn't relate to the described behavior.  The passage depicts people making things *more* complex with their superficiality.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulties and dangers faced by the story's characters (""jigeen"") when traveling through challenging terrains (deserts, mountains).**  It specifically mentions the harshness of the environment (""wuute ci wàllum cosaan mën naa waral liñuy"") and the struggles they endure.
* **Option C directly addresses this hardship:** ""Indeed, everything in the harsh environment has made it difficult for them to stay in their situation."" It acknowledges the challenging environment and its impact on the characters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nangu ni lu neew la nga am ñu lay bayyi xel** (It seems that what you have is just to confuse people's minds) - This doesn't relate to the main theme of the passage.
* **B: Sol ab jaaro bu yaatu ngir wone ni da ngay sey** (Just a long journey for you to see) - This is too vague and doesn't capture the *struggle* described.
* **D: Sudee dañu lay jéema wax lu la neexul, fasal sa kanal di bañal góor ñi** (They just keep saying what is lost, because their channels are filled with nonsense) -  This introduces an element of complaining and foolishness that isn't the central focus of the passage.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and relevant response to the question, reflecting the core theme of hardship and struggle in the face of a difficult journey."
"Sunu sukkandikoo ci xët bi, ban anam moo mêna tax ba ab fotogaraafu mala jëfandikoo ab yëf bu spesiyaal?","The correct answer is **B: Sudee dañuy jëfandikoo foto yi ngir ay jubluwaay jënd ak jaay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the importance of photos as memories.** It states ""Foto mala yi dafay faral di laaj ab xëccukaayu foto bu guddu..."" (Photos are important to keep good memories...).  It also mentions how photos help remember loved ones who have passed away.
* **Option B directly relates to this idea.** It translates to ""They often take photos for joyful moments and celebrations."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's emphasis on preserving memories through photography.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rawatina suèuy foto espèce yu ndaw yi:**  (They only take photos of rare species) - The passage doesn't mention anything about *what* is photographed, just the *importance* of photography.
* **C: Sudee mala yuñuy foto dañoo am kersa:** (They often want photos to have value) - While photos *have* value, the passage focuses on their emotional and memorial value, not monetary.
* **D: Sudee park bi dafa am ay sàrtu yu xejjiku yu àju ci foto mala yi:** (The park often has strange objects used in photos) - This is not mentioned in the passage at all.



"
Ban ci yile lañu limul ci xët bii niki ab jafe-jafe bu mëna am ci foto ay mala?,"The correct answer is **B: Bayyi xel ci mala yuy songaate.**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses photos (foto mala yi) and how they capture moments, especially joyful ones (jafe-jafe).** It mentions that good photos can evoke memories and feelings.  The passage specifically states that photos *songaate* (hold, contain) things.
* **Option B directly relates to this idea of photos holding memories and experiences (""Bayyi xel ci mala yuy songaate"" - ""There is thought/understanding in the photos they hold"").**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gis yenn mala yuy joge fu sori (""This photo is beautiful because it's old"")** - The passage doesn't focus on the age of the photos, but on what they *contain*.
* **C: Seet xeetu letille lentilles yimuy laaj (""This person sells lentils that are very wide"")** - Completely unrelated to the passage.
* **D: Liggéey ci ay barab yu hotiles (""They are lying on hot sands"")** -  Also unrelated to the passage's topic of photos and memories.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that aligns with the central theme of the text."
Ban ci yile mooy wara mëna waral ay jafe-jafe ci ab dawalkat buy tukko ci ay montaañ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ambuteyaas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Sooy dawal ci yoon yu am galaas ak neige dangay xam ni pëno yi duñu jàpp bu baax, kon bul melni kuy dawal ci goudron.""  This translates to ""Roads with ice and snow are very dangerous, but asphalt is better.""  This indicates a danger related to ice and snow on roads, especially in mountainous areas.
* **Ambuteyaas** (meaning ""danger"" or ""hazard"") directly relates to the dangers described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jaxasoo bu neew:** (Meaning ""a new opportunity"") - Doesn't connect to the content of the passage.
* **C: Tañcaloo bu metti:** (Meaning ""a small problem"") - The passage describes a *significant* danger, not a small problem.
* **D: Gisiin bu waññeeku:** (Meaning ""a useful lesson"") - While one could *learn* from the dangers, the passage focuses on the dangers themselves, not the lesson learned.



"
Lan mo wara doon luy wey di sax ci juuti yuñuy jëlee ci njuréef yu ci réew yu bari yu?,"The correct answer is **A: Njëg yi**.

Here's why:

* **P (the passage) talks about diplomats and the difficulties they face when returning to their home country after being stationed abroad.** It mentions the challenges of readjusting, especially concerning cost of living and lifestyle.  The passage specifically discusses the high cost of living in cities like New York or Canada compared to their home countries.
* **Q (the question) asks about why people often struggle to settle back into life in their home countries after living abroad.**
* **""Njëg yi"" (problems/difficulties)** directly addresses the core issue presented in the passage. The passage *describes* these problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Barabu liggéeyukaay (Expensive living)** - While expensive living *is* a problem mentioned, it's not the overarching reason people struggle to settle. It's a *symptom* of the broader difficulties.
* **C: Fi ngay déposé (I have deposited)** - This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: Jàppukaay yi (The tourists)** - This is also irrelevant to the passage which discusses diplomats, not tourists.



Therefore, **Njëg yi (problems/difficulties)** best encapsulates the reason described in the passage for why people struggle to readjust to life in their home countries."

Here's why:

* **P** describes a situation where someone is a diplomat and wants to deposit their belongings (including a will) in a safe place within the country they are stationed in. They mention difficulties finding a suitable place, especially in large cities like those in America or Canada, and the need for a secure system between banks.
* **Q** asks *where* someone in that situation would likely deposit their will.
* **A: Fépp fooy nekk lu bari** (A safe deposit box in a bank) is the most logical and secure place to deposit important documents like a will, directly addressing the need for security described in **P**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ci Etats-unis** (In the United States) - This only specifies a country, not a *place* for the deposit.
* **C: Ci réew mi nga xamantane foo ngay liggéeyee** (In the country where you currently reside) - Too broad and doesn't address the security aspect.
* **D: Fépp fi nga xamantane njëg yi foofu la gëna yombee** (A place where you can keep things and have peace of mind) - While true, this is vague and doesn't give a specific solution like a safe deposit box.

Ban ci yile wax moodul leeral bu baax ab Fuwaar universel?,"The correct answer is **A: Expositions yi dañoo wara wone jaar-jaar wala cosaanu ab réew.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Réew yi bokk wone nañu ay nataalu aada ak cosaan ak yuy yete ci bërëb biir réew bi ngir fésal yoonu àdduna wala seen aada ak tariixu réew."" This directly translates to ""Countries participate in them to showcase their culture and achievements and to promote understanding between countries to celebrate world peace or their culture and history.""  This means the expositions are about countries showcasing themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While gardens and plants are mentioned (""jardin botanik ak leneen""), the passage doesn't say the expositions *are* botanical exhibitions.
* **C:**  The passage mentions large areas (""50 ektaar""), but the focus isn't on the size itself, but rather what happens *within* that space.
* **D:** While countries *do* participate, the question asks what the expositions *are* – their purpose.  Simply stating that countries attend doesn't define the exposition itself.

Yan ci yile mooy ab sàrtu Fuwaar Universel wala Exposition internationale?,"The correct answer is **A: Expositions yi dañu wara wone jaar-jaaru ab réew mi ak jafe-jafe yimu am ci adduna bi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ca Fuwaar Internasiyonaal (buñuy woowee Exposisiyon Monjaal, wala Expo kese) am na fa ab fatiwaalu fent ak xarala bu mag. Réew yi bokk wone nañu ay nataalu aada ak cosaan ak yuy yete ci bërëb biir réew bi ngir fésal yoonu àdduna wala seen aada ak tariixu réew.""  This directly translates to ""International Expositions...are a platform for large-scale exchanges. Countries participate in them to showcase their culture and history to the world.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While countries *do* present innovations, the passage emphasizes cultural and historical display more broadly.
* **C:** The passage mentions the *size* of the expositions (50 hectares) but doesn't say that's the *purpose* of them.
* **D:**  The passage says countries participate *to* showcase, not simply *that* they participate.

Ban ci yile jëf mooy waññi risk bi nga xamantane mala yi mën nañ la song?,"The correct answer is **C: Bayyi ab digante bu toll ci 25 yaar ak xaju àll yi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""rab yi ngeen bàyyi 25 yard/mètre seen diggante ak yeneen mala yi!"" This directly translates to ""rabbits are found 25 yards/meters away from the fences."" This implies a risk associated with the fences - rabbits are close enough to potentially get through or be near them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yore ay ñax yu am saf-safal:** The passage doesn't mention anything about successful hunts.
*   **B: Gennee mbaliit yu ci camping bi:** The passage describes a park, not a camping site.
*   **D: Fexe ba mala yi dem ci ay desit lekk:** While the passage mentions fences, it doesn't focus on the fences *breaking* or being in poor condition. It highlights the proximity of the rabbits *to* the fences.



"
Ban ci yile lañu limul ci xët bi niki lu mëna wara ay congi mala?,"The correct answer is **B: Ñakka teye bayyi ab digante**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a park with different sections for dogs:

*   100 yard/meter sections for dogs with owners.
*   25 yard/meter sections for dogs without owners (stray or abandoned).

The question asks about what limits the dogs in the park. The passage clearly states that dogs are separated by distances (""100 yard/meter"" and ""25 yard/meter"") - meaning they are limited by boundaries. ""Ñakka teye bayyi ab digante"" translates to ""limits that are far apart"" or ""boundaries that are far apart,"" which directly relates to the described park layout.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ay xet yu foor** (The colors of the grass) - The passage doesn't discuss the color of the grass.
*   **C: Dundal ay mala** (Finding dogs) - While the passage mentions dogs, the question isn’t about locating them.
*   **D: Mala yu miinul nit** (Dogs that help people) - The passage doesn’t mention service or helper dogs.
