在工廠事故發生後，以下何者不是給當地居民的安全建議之一？,"The correct answer is **C: 避免吸入白色煙霧 (Avoid inhaling white smoke)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the following safety recommendations:

*   **待在室內 (Stay indoors)**
*   **關閉冷氣空調 (Close windows and air conditioning)** - This is equivalent to ""Avoid using air conditioning.""
*   **勿飲用自來水 (Do not drink tap water)**

The passage *does not* mention any advice about avoiding inhaling the white smoke. While it's a reasonable precaution, it wasn't part of the official guidance given to residents as reported in the text."
根據摩爾醫師的說法，極具抗藥性的結核病最令人擔憂的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 它的高致死率**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""新的變異株「有極高的致死率，因此非常令人不安和恐慌」"" which directly translates to ""the new variant 'has a very high mortality rate, therefore it is very worrying and frightening'."" This is the primary concern Dr. Moll expresses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 變異株在醫院中感染的情況 (The situation of the variant infecting people in hospitals)** - While he notes this *happens*, it's not the *most* concerning aspect.
*   **B: 變異株對藥物的抵抗力 (The variant's resistance to drugs)** - This is inherent in it being XDR-TB (Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis), but the *result* of that resistance - the high death rate - is what he emphasizes.
*   **C: 感染者可能感染的人數 (The number of people an infected person might infect)** - This is a concern for spread, but again, the *severity* of the infection (high death rate) is the main issue.



"
在確定感染這種新變異株的患者中，有多少人證實是醫護人員？,"The correct answer is **B: 2 人**.

The passage states: ""莫爾醫生認為有些病人可能是在醫院中感染上病菌，且至少有兩個病例為醫護人員。"" (Dr. Moll believes some patients may have been infected in hospital, and at least two cases were healthcare workers.)
"
NextGen 系統使用哪種技術？,"The correct answer is **A: 衛星技術**.

The passage explicitly states: ""It uses **satellite-based** technology..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 精確技術** - While NextGen *results* in more precise positioning, ""precise technology"" isn't the *type* of technology it uses.
* **C: 地面雷達的技術** - The passage specifically contrasts NextGen with ""ground-based radar"" and states it uses something *different*.
* **D: 碳排放技術** - NextGen *reduces* carbon emissions, but doesn't *use* technology related to them.



"
NextGen 如何直接幫助空中交通管制員？,"The correct answer is **B: 更精確的飛機位置**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It [NextGen] uses satellite-based technology... to allow air traffic controllers to **more precisely locate aircraft**..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 更短的飛行路線** - While NextGen *results* in shorter routes, that's a consequence of the more precise positioning, not how it directly helps controllers.
*   **C: 減少碳排放** - This is a *benefit* of NextGen, not how it directly aids controllers.
*   **D: 使用較少的燃料** - Similar to C, this is a result, not a direct help to controllers.

Therefore, NextGen directly helps controllers by giving them a more accurate picture of where the planes are."
根據文章，歷史學家沒有批評 FBI 集中在哪一點？,"The correct answer is **C: 高度關注色情案件**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states historians *criticized* the FBI for focusing on easy cases (like car thefts) to boost statistics.**  This means options A, B, and D are things historians did criticize.
* **The passage mentions the FBI being *required* to dedicate resources to pornography cases starting in 2005, but it doesn't say historians criticized this focus.** It simply states it *happened*.

Therefore, the historians did *not* criticize the FBI's focus on pornography.
"
猥褻防治措施迫使 FBI 做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 指派探員投入色情案件**.

Here's why:

The passage states directly that Congress ""required the FBI to assign ten agents to adult pornography cases"" starting in 2005 with funding for obscenity prevention measures. This is a clear directive and action taken *because* of the obscenity prevention funding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 分配更多資源於汽車失竊案** - The passage actually describes a *past* criticism of the FBI focusing *on* easily solved cases like car theft. This isn't related to the new obscenity prevention measures.
*   **B: 提高該機構的成功率** - While the past focus on easy cases aimed to *increase* success rates, the passage doesn't state that the obscenity prevention measures were intended for this purpose.
*   **C: 專注於應該容易解決的犯罪案件** - Again, this describes a *previous* FBI practice, not a result of the new funding.



"
對 JAS 39C 獅鷲戰鬥機墜機事件作出反應的消防車發生了什麼事？ ,"The correct answer is **B: It overturned**.

The passage states: ""當地媒體報導一輛機場消防車在出勤時翻覆。"" (Local media reported that an airport fire truck overturned while responding.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: It crashed** - The *plane* crashed, not the fire truck.
*   **C: It exploded** - The *plane* exploded, not the fire truck.
*   **D: It ran out of gas** - There is no mention of this in the text.



"
發生 JAS 39C 獅鷲戰鬥機墜機事件後，機場對什麼關閉了？,"The correct answer is **A: 商業航班**.

The text states the crash ""led to the suspension of commercial flights' takeoffs and landings at the airport."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 消防車** - While a fire truck *crashed*, the airport didn't close due to the fire truck.
* **C: 當地媒體** - The media *reported* on the event, they weren't closed.
* **D: 空軍少校** - The pilot was identified, but wasn't something the airport closed.



"
布里辛斯基在伊朗革命期間指點了誰？,"The correct answer is **C: 卡特**.

The passage states: ""As a member of the US National Security Bureau, he assisted Carter in handling world affairs diplomatically, such as the Iranian Revolution of 1979."" This directly indicates that Brzezinski advised Carter during the Iranian Revolution."
誰一直擔任國家安全顧問直到 1977 年？,"The correct answer is **B: 季辛吉 (Kissinger)**.

The passage states that Zbigniew Brzezinski *succeeded* Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor in 1977. This means Kissinger held the position until 1977.
"
以下何者並未正確反映波貝克在貝爾格萊德游擊隊的職業生涯？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在為球隊效力期間踢進超過 468 個進球**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states he scored 403 points (goals), not over 468.** He played 468 *games*, but did not *score* over 468 points.
* The other options are all directly supported by the text:
    * **B:** ""他在球隊中的出場數與進球數居冠"" (He topped the team in both appearances and goals).
    * **C:** ""1995 年，他獲選為游擊隊足球俱樂部的史上最佳球員"" (In 1995, he was selected as the best player in Partizan football club history).
    * **D:** ""他在該隊期間，共計出賽 468 次"" (He played a total of 468 games during his time with the team).
"
有關波貝克在貝爾格萊德游擊隊歷史，哪項陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **A: He started playing for Belgrade Partizan in 1945.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""He joined the team in 1945 and stayed until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: In Zagreb he played before joining Belgrade Partizan:** The passage states he was *born* in Zagreb, not that he *played* for a team there.
* **C: He played for Belgrade Partizan until 1995:** The passage says he left in 1958, and was *awarded* the best player in 1995.
* **D: He became famous after being selected as Partizan's best player:** The passage says he *became famous while playing* for Partizan, and the award came much later.



"
根據文章，哪個特徵讓伊氏西爪龍有別於迅猛龍？,"The correct answer is **B: 牠第二隻爪比較大**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""牠的第二隻爪比較大，使牠獲得西爪龍的封號，意指「西方之爪」"" (Its second claw is larger, giving it the name *Ieunator*, meaning ""western claw"").  This directly identifies the larger second claw as a distinguishing feature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 牠有兩條腿** - The passage doesn't say this is a *difference* between *Ieunator* and *Velociraptor*; it implies both walked on two legs.
*   **C: 牠全身長滿羽毛** - The passage states *Ieunator* was covered in feathers, but also says *Velociraptor* was likely feathered too, so it's not a distinguishing feature.
*   **D: 牠是溫血動物** -  Similar to feathers, the passage indicates both *Ieunator* and *Velociraptor* were likely warm-blooded, so it's not a difference between them.



"
「西爪龍」的含義源自該物種的什麼身體特徵？,"The correct answer is **A: 爪子**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the name ""Velociraptor"" (which translates to ""western claw"") comes from its **second claw being comparatively large**. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 全身覆蓋羽毛 (Covered in feathers):** While the passage mentions it was covered in feathers, this isn't the origin of the name ""western claw.""
*   **C: 腿 (Legs):** The passage mentions it *could* walk upright on its legs, but this isn't the source of its name.
*   **D: 喙 (Beak):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a beak.



"
關於槍擊事件的陳述，下列何者為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 槍擊事件發生在水牛城 (The shooting happened in Buffalo)**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the husband was killed in a shooting *in Buffalo* and that they celebrated their wedding *in Buffalo*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 丈夫和妻子都來自德克薩斯州 (Both husband and wife are from Texas)** - The text states the couple got married in Texas, but only states the *husband* was *born* in Buffalo.
*   **B: 有五個受害者 (There were five victims)** - The text states four people were killed.
*   **C: 這對夫婦一年前在水牛城結婚 (The couple got married in Buffalo a year ago)** - The text states the couple got married *in Texas* a year ago, and went to Buffalo to celebrate.



"
關於槍擊事件的陳述，下列何者是正確的？,"The correct answer is **A: 發生在水牛城的一個週年慶祝派對上**.

Here's why:

* The text states the husband was killed at a party while celebrating their anniversary *in Buffalo* (水牛城).
* It explicitly mentions they originally celebrated their wedding in Buffalo a year ago, and were back there for this anniversary celebration.
* The text contrasts this party with a *planned* formal anniversary event ""several days later.""
* It does not say the shooting occurred in Texas or at the wedding itself.

Therefore, option A is the only statement supported by the provided text.
"
根據文章，主管人員對魯諾號最初的擔憂是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 燃油洩漏 (Fuel Leak)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""…主管人員原本害怕它會灑出許多 (it would spill a lot)."" and earlier mentions the ship had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel.  This clearly indicates the concern was about a fuel spill.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 缺乏肥料貨物 (Lack of fertilizer cargo):** The passage says the ship *was* going to carry fertilizer, not that there was a lack of it.
* **B: 海浪和強風 (Waves and strong winds):** While the waves and wind *caused* the grounding, the passage focuses on the fear of what the ship might release *because* of the incident.
* **D: 船員可能會受傷 (Crew members might be injured):** While one crew member *was* injured, the passage specifically notes the *主管人員 (officials)* were worried about the spill.



"
根據文章，關於魯諾號的故障，以下哪一個敘述不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 發生故障時，船上有 100 立方公尺的燃料**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship had **120 to 160 cubic meters** of fuel when it broke down, not 100.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: 故障發生在裝載貨物之前** - The passage says the ship was *on its way to carry a shipment of fertilizer* which implies it hadn't loaded it yet.
*   **C: 在十二名船員中，有一人受傷** - The passage states *twelve crew members were rescued, one with a broken nose*.
*   **D: 船被推到防波堤上** - The passage states *the gale and waves pushed it against a breakwater*.



"
阿爾及利亞在哪個年代獲得獨立？,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 年代**. 

The passage states ""He returned to newly independent Algeria in the 1960s to teach film direction."" This directly indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
哪些地方的葬禮儀式沒有設置電視螢幕？,"The correct answer is **D: 在聖伯多祿廣場 (In St. Peter's Square)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that large screens were set up *because* not everyone could fit *into* St. Peter's Square. This implies that there were no screens *within* St. Peter's Square itself; people inside the square could view the ceremony directly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 整個羅馬 (The entire city of Rome):** The text clearly states screens were set up *throughout* Rome.
*   **B: 在義大利的各個城市 (In various cities in Italy):** Screens were set up in other Italian cities.
*   **C: 波蘭的某些地方 (Certain places in Poland):** Screens were set up in Poland as well."
葬禮在哪裡舉行？,"The correct answer is **C: 在聖伯多祿廣場 (In St. Peter's Square)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""不是每個人都能進入聖伯多祿廣場參加葬禮 (not everyone could get into St. Peter's Square to attend the funeral)."" This clearly identifies St. Peter's Square as the *primary* location of the funeral.
* While the funeral was *viewed* in many places (Rome, other Italian cities, Poland, etc.) via screens, the actual ceremony took place in St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在整個羅馬的不同地點 (In different locations throughout Rome):**  While screens were *set up* around Rome, the funeral itself wasn't happening in multiple locations.
* **B: 在波蘭 (In Poland):** Poland had screens to *view* the funeral, but it wasn't where the funeral *was* held.
* **D: 首先在羅馬，然後在另一個義大利城市 (First in Rome, then in another Italian city):** The passage doesn't mention the funeral moving to another city."
爆炸發生後，誰因重傷接受治療？,"The correct answer is **B: 沒有人 (No one)**.

The passage states ""無任何重大傷亡匯報 (No major injuries were reported)."" While five people were treated for shock, shock isn't considered a major injury. Therefore, no one was treated for *serious* injuries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 至少五個人 (At least five people):** They were treated for shock, not serious injuries.
*   **C: 瓦斯公司主管 (The gas company supervisor):** The passage doesn't mention the supervisor being injured.
*   **D: 一個鄰居 (A neighbor):** The passage only says the neighbor reported the leak, not that they were injured.



"
是誰通報了瓦斯洩漏？,"The correct answer is **A: 大樓裡的一個鄰居**.

The passage states: ""In neighboring residents called to report a gas leak..."" This directly indicates a neighbor reported the leak.
"
根據文章，有多少人在攻擊中喪生？,"The correct answer is **B: 2 人**.

The passage states: ""死者為 25 歲的尼可拉斯．阿爾登 (Nicholas Alden) 和 21 歲的札克利．庫德巴克 Zachary Cuddeback."" This directly translates to ""The deceased are 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback,"" meaning two people died.
"
在攻擊期間，誰的武器在某個時刻失靈了？,"The correct answer is **B: 烏卡**. 

The text states: ""烏卡瞄準第五個人的頭部時槍枝失靈."" (Uka's weapon malfunctioned when aiming for the fifth person's head.)
"
以下哪項運動在奧運項目投票表決中落選？,"The correct answer is **A: 壁球**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""壁球、空手道和滑輪溜冰就像棒球與壘球，都試圖躋身奧運項目，但在 2005 年的投票表決中紛紛落選。"" This directly indicates that squash (壁球) was among the sports that failed to be included in the Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 橄欖球** - The passage states rugby *was* chosen for the Olympics (specifically, seven-a-side rugby).
*   **C: 棒球** - The passage mentions baseball as *having* been previously rejected.
*   **D: 空手道** - While karate was rejected, the question specifically asks which sport fell in the vote, and 壁球 is the first sport mentioned that fell in the vote.



"
國際奧委會投票決定將以下哪些運動納入比賽項目？,"The correct answer is **C: 英式橄欖球 (Rugby)**.

The passage states: ""英式橄欖球，精確來說是七人制橄欖球，以及高爾夫球，勝過其他五項運動，被列為奧運項目。"" (Rugby, specifically seven-a-side rugby, and golf were chosen as Olympic sports.)

The other options are incorrect because the passage states they *tried* to be included but were not selected:

*   滑輪溜冰 (Roller skating) - fell short in the 2005 vote.
*   棒球 (Baseball) - mentioned as having tried and failed.
*   壘球 (Softball) - mentioned as having tried and failed."
亞瑟·健力士最初租用聖詹姆士門釀酒廠多少年？,"The correct answer is **D: 9000 年**.

The passage explicitly states Arthur Guinness signed a lease for the St. James's Gate brewery for **nine thousand years**. The 250 years mentioned refers to how long the company has been growing into a global business, *after* the initial lease was signed.
"
健力士每年大約帶來幾十億美元的收入？,"The correct answer is **C: 140 億**.

Here's why:

The passage states Guinness has annual revenue *over* 100 billion euros, which is *approximately* 147 billion US dollars.  Of the choices given, 140 billion is the closest.

*   **A: 90 億** is too low.
*   **B: 2500 億** is far too high.
*   **D: 100 億** is also too low - the passage says *over* 100 billion euros/147 billion dollars."
歐盟有多少個國家曾經發現過 H5N1 病毒？,"The correct answer is **C: 七個 (Seven)**.

The passage states that France is the *seventh* EU country to be affected by the virus, after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy. 

Therefore, seven countries have confirmed cases."
最近的一例 H5N1 病毒感染案例是在哪裡發現的？,"The correct answer is **A: 法國**.

The passage states: ""…已證實感染了一隻於週一在法國東部里昂附近沼澤地中發現的死野鴨。"" (…it has been confirmed that a dead wild duck found on Monday in a marsh near Lyon, eastern France, was infected.)
"
在維和部隊引發傳播前，海地最後一次遇到該疾病是在何時？,"The correct answer is **A: In the 18th century**.

The text specifically states: ""Before the troops arrived, Haiti had not experienced problems related to cholera for centuries, dating back to the 18th century.""
"
哪個地點的廢棄物導致了該疾病的傳播？,"The correct answer is **B: 聯合國營地**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the disease originated near the UN peacekeeping force's camps, and that **waste from the UN camps** was improperly disposed of, contaminating a tributary of the Artibonite River. While the Artibonite River *was* affected (option A), the source of the contamination was the UN camp waste.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: 2010 年地震遺址:** The earthquake created the conditions, but didn't directly spread the disease. The disease came *after* the earthquake with the arrival of the peacekeeping forces.
*   **D: 海地正義與民主組織:** This is an organization referencing research; it didn't *cause* the spread.



"
愛爾蘭政府計劃做什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 提出毒品犯罪者的判決 (Challenge sentences of drug offenders)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Minister for Health expressed concern about ""sentences in drug-related cases"" following the constitutional change.** This indicates the government is focused on reviewing and potentially challenging existing judgments related to drug offenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 引入更嚴格的毒品容許度法律 (Introduce stricter drug tolerance laws)** - The passage speaks to *concerns* about people taking advantage of temporary legality, suggesting they want to *restrict* it, not make it stricter.
* **C: 放寬毒品容許度法律 (Loosen drug tolerance laws)** - The passage specifically highlights the need to *correct* the current situation, implying the current temporary legality is problematic.
* **D: 將毒品除罪化 (Decriminalise drugs)** - The passage doesn't suggest decriminalization; it focuses on the need for legislative changes to address the legality of substances and the impact on criminal justice.



"
在愛爾蘭，什麼是暫時合法的？,"The correct answer is **D: 毒品**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions concerns about individuals taking advantage of the ""temporary legality of the substances"" and the impact on drug-related crime. This directly indicates that certain drugs are temporarily legal in Ireland.

The other options (burglary, fraud, and assault) are not mentioned in the passage and are unrelated to the issue being discussed.



"
嫌疑犯正以什麼罪名接受調查？,"The correct answer is **A: 非法侵入 (Trespassing)**.

The text explicitly states: ""該名男性嫌疑犯正以非法侵入罪名接受調查，而非破壞公物."" (The male suspect is being investigated for trespassing, not vandalism.)
"
在修改標誌時，嫌疑犯沒有做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 損壞它的實體 (Damage it physically)**.

The passage specifically states: ""標誌沒有遭到實際損壞 (The sign was not actually damaged)..."".  The other options are things the suspect *did* do.

* **A: 更改其中一個字母 (Change one of the letters)** - They changed the ""O"" to an ""e"".
* **B: 用和平符號裝飾它 (Decorate it with a peace symbol)** - The passage says it was decorated with peace and heart symbols.
* **D: 使用防水布對其進行修改 (Modify it using tarpaulin)** - They used black tarpaulin to alter the sign.
"
根據文章，英語教師范浩揚並未被指控以下哪項罪名？,"The correct answer is **B: 與學生交往 (Having relationships with students)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 侵犯版權 (Copyright infringement):** The passage states he ""was previously accused of copyright infringement, but not prosecuted.""
* **C: 刊登未授權的廣告 (Publishing unauthorized advertisements):**  The passage states ""Modern Education accused him of falsely claiming to be the chief English teacher of the company and publishing large advertisements on buses without authorization.""
* **D: 在課堂上使用髒話 (Using profanity in class):** The passage states ""it is said he also uses foul language in class.""

However, the article only states he was close to his students (""亦師亦友"" - like a friend and teacher) and taught them dating tips. It **does not** accuse him of *having relationships* with them. Therefore, B is the only option he wasn't directly accused of.



"
根據文章，誰沒有被羅蘭多·蒙多薩扣為人質？,"正確答案是 **B: 警察**。

文章中說明羅蘭多·蒙多薩劫持的是**香港觀光客**，並把他們當作人質。 雖然攝影師被釋放，但一開始他們也是被扣為人質。 孩子們也被釋放，但他們確實是人質。 警察則是被派去處理事件，而非人質。
"
根據文章，哪些人質沒有確認提前獲釋？,"The correct answer is **A: 觀光客**.

Here's why:

* The text states six tourists were initially released, including children and the elderly. It also mentions two photographers and an elderly woman were released *in exchange* for others. This implies that the remaining tourists were not confirmed as being released early.
* **B: 老年人** are specifically mentioned as being among those released.
* **C: 攝影師** are also specifically mentioned as being released.
* **D: 孩子們** are also specifically mentioned as being among those released.

Therefore, the only group not explicitly stated as being released upfront is the general group of **觀光客** (tourists).
"
根據文章，誰正在收集支持巴西同性婚姻合法化的連署簽名？,"The correct answer is **A: 示威者**.

The passage states: ""示威者希望能夠收集一百二十萬個連署簽名，在十一月提交給國會。"" (Demonstrators hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to submit to Congress in November.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 羅伯托·傑弗遜 (Roberto Jefferson):** He is handling the revised bill, not collecting signatures.
* **C: 羅馬天主教會 (The Roman Catholic Church):** The passage states the church *opposes* same-sex marriage legalization.
* **D: 瑪爾塔·蘇普利希 (Marta Suplicy):** She drafted the original bill, but isn't currently collecting signatures.



"
示威者將把他們的請願書提交給誰？,"The correct answer is **C: 巴西國會 (Brazilian Congress)**.

The passage states: ""示威者希望能夠收集一百二十萬個連署簽名，在十一月提交給國會 (Congress)."" 

Therefore, they will submit their petition to the Brazilian Congress.



"
根據阿曼·維薩切的說法，在人群開始對天氣作出反應之前發生了什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 有大風 (There was strong wind)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""表演剛開演五分鐘就突然捲起一陣狂風，大約一分鐘後風速就已高達每小時 70 公里…"" (The performance had only been going for five minutes when a strong wind suddenly arose, reaching 70 kilometers per hour after about a minute...). This happened *before* the rain, hail, panic, and people getting lost or trampled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 開始下冰雹 (It started to hail):** Hail came *after* the wind and rain.
*   **B: 表演延遲五分鐘 (The performance was delayed for five minutes):** The performance *started* and then the wind came, it wasn't delayed.
*   **D: 他失去與一名家庭成員的聯繫 (He lost contact with a family member):** He lost his sister *during* the chaos, not before the weather began to affect people.



"
根據維薩切的說法，最強的風是什麼時候開始的？,"The correct answer is **A: 表演開始後數分鐘**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""表演剛開演五分鐘就突然捲起一陣狂風，大約一分鐘後風速就已高達每小時 70 公里…"" This directly indicates the strong winds began shortly after the performance started (within the first five minutes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 下雨後** - The winds came *before* the heavy rain.
*   **C: 他失去他妹妹之後** - Losing his sister was a consequence of the chaos, not the cause of the wind.
*   **D: 下冰雹之前** - The winds and rain preceded the hail.



"
在弗雷德之前，在 35°W 以東記錄了多少個重大颶風？,"The correct answer is **C: 二個 (Two)**.

The text states: ""弗雷德是有衛星影像以來，大西洋東南方記錄上威力最強的熱帶颶風，卻還只是 35°W 以東記錄上第三大颶風。"" This directly implies that there were two other major hurricanes recorded east of 35°W before Fred.
"
當弗雷德位於維德角島附近時，它往哪個方向移動？,"The correct answer is **A: 西方**.

The text states: ""弗雷德 (Fred) 目前風速為每小時 105 英里（165 公里／小時）並往西北方前進。""  ""西北方"" means moving towards the northwest, which has a westward component. Therefore, when Fred was near Cape Verde (維德角島), it was moving westward.
"
以下何者的速度比其前代更快？,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""802.11n 的速度比過去的設備都要快非常多"" (802.11n is much faster than previous devices). 

The other options were older standards that 802.11n superseded.
"
802.11n 與 802.11b 兼容需要什麼條件？,"The correct answer is **D: 雙射頻 (Dual-band)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""If the base station has dual-band, this will make it downward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g."" This directly links dual-band capability to compatibility with older standards like 802.11b.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 明顯更快的速度 (Clearly faster speeds)** - While 802.11n *is* faster, speed alone doesn't guarantee compatibility.
*   **B: 讓 802.11b 能在 5.0Ghz 上運作的能力 (The ability to allow 802.11b to operate on 5.0Ghz)** - 802.11b doesn't operate on 5.0Ghz.  It uses 2.4Ghz.
*   **C: 600Mbit/s 的傳輸量 (600Mbit/s transmission rate)** - This is a feature *of* 802.11n, not a requirement for compatibility with 802.11b.



"
這位奧運金牌選手原本要在大英國協運動會參加幾場游泳比賽？,"The correct answer is **A: 五場**.

The passage states the athlete was planning to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle *and* three relay races. 2 + 3 = 5.
"
為什麼奧運金牌選手沒有服用藥物來止痛？,"The correct answer is **C: He worried about negative effects on his condition.**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states he **cannot** take medication because it's **banned by the Olympics**. It then links this to concerns about his ""condition"" and implies the medication might worsen it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He isn't in pain** - The passage says his ""symptoms"" are raising concerns, implying he *is* experiencing something that causes discomfort.
* **B: The medication makes him uncomfortable** - The passage doesn't mention discomfort with the medication itself, only the rules against it.
* **D: The Commonwealth Games don't allow this medication** - The passage states the *Olympics* ban the medication, not the Commonwealth Games.



"
根據文章，什麼可能會導致有關地震活動的混淆？,"The correct answer is **A: 烏雲的存在**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""山腳下出現與任何火山活動皆無關的烏雲據。眼前所見的雲可能造成混淆，不確定是否真的發生火山爆發。""  This directly links the clouds to potential confusion about volcanic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 冰島氣象局的報告** - The report *clarifies* there's no recent activity, it doesn't cause confusion.
*   **C: 國際地震地圖** - The map also *clarifies* a lack of recent activity.
*   **D: 其他冰島地區的活動報告** - The text doesn't mention activity in other regions causing confusion.



"
根據文章，什麼時候發生了狀態改變？,"The correct answer is **C: 三月十日 (March 10th)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""引發狀態改變的明顯地震活動發生於 3 月 10 日..."" (Significant seismic activity that triggered a change in state occurred on March 10th...).

Therefore, the change in state was triggered *on* March 10th. Let's look at why the other answers are incorrect:

*   **A: 三月十日之前 (Before March 10th)** - The change in state *happened* on March 10th, not before.
*   **B: 過去 48 小時內 (Within the last 48 hours)** - The text specifically says there's been no activity in the last 48 hours *after* the change was triggered.
*   **D: 前一周 (Last week)** - The text mentions last week to state there were no earthquakes, but the triggering event was on March 10th."
有關月船 1 號的月球探測器，以下哪個陳述不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: 發射探測器的軌道飛行器配有機組人員 (The orbital spacecraft that launched the probe was crewed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the probe (MIP) was *deployed* from the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter.  The use of the word ""無人"" (unmanned) when referring to the orbiter indicates it did *not* have a crew.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **B: 探測器包含重要儀器 (The probe contains important instruments)** - The passage states it carried three significant scientific instruments.
* **C: 探測器彈出成功 (The probe was successfully deployed)** - The passage explicitly says the MIP was successfully released.
* **D: 探測器各面有彩繪 (The probe has paintings on all sides)** - The passage states the probe had images including the Indian flag painted on its sides.



"
關於月球探測器，以下哪個描述正確？,"The correct answer is **B: It made a successful hard landing.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...successfully made a hard landing near the lunar south pole.""  ""Hard landing"" means it wasn't a soft, controlled landing, but it *did* land successfully.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: It landed near the lunar north pole:** The passage specifically states it landed near the *south* pole.
* **C: It was ejected from a manned orbital spacecraft:** The passage says it was deployed from ""Chang'e 1"", an *unmanned* orbital probe.
* **D: It carried two important instruments:** The passage states it carried *three* important instruments.



"
根據文章，哪項防範疾病的措施最後才會實施？,"The correct answer is **C: 腦炎疫苗**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government *promised* to produce millions of Japanese encephalitis vaccines to prepare for *next year's* outbreak. However, the plan to deliver the vaccines to the worst-affected areas was *delayed* this year due to lack of funds and lower priority. This clearly indicates the vaccine implementation is happening last and won't be fully effective until the next outbreak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 使用殺蟲劑 (Using Insecticides):** The passage says insecticides were sprayed, implying this was done *alongside* other measures.
*   **B: 捕豬隊 (Pig-catching teams):** The passage states pig-catching teams were *deployed* in affected areas.
*   **D: 蚊帳 (Mosquito nets):** Mosquito nets were *distributed*.

Therefore, the production and delivery of the vaccine are the measures that are delayed and will only be fully implemented in the future."
這種疾病是如何傳染給人類的？,"The correct answer is **A: 蚊子 (Mosquitoes)**.

The passage states: ""這種疾病存在於豬身上，然後透過蚊子傳播給人類。"" (This disease exists in pigs, and then is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 使用殺蟲劑 (Using pesticides):** Pesticides are used to *control* the spread, not how it's transmitted.
* **C: 豬 (Pigs):** Pigs *carry* the disease, but don't directly transmit it to humans.
* **D: 捕豬隊 (Pig catching teams):** Pig catching teams are a response to the outbreak, not the method of transmission.



"
第二條文宣判失敗可能會導致什麼結果？,"The correct answer is **B: 未來有權進行同性民事結合 (Future right to same-sex civil unions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""禁止同性民事結合的提議經第二次宣判失敗，有可能開啟未來同性民事結合之門 (The proposal to ban same-sex civil unions failed for the second time, potentially opening the door to future same-sex civil unions).""  This directly links the failure of the ban to the possibility of allowing same-sex civil unions in the future.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 眾議院聯合決議 3 立即重新審查 (House Joint Resolution 3 immediately re-examined)** - While Resolution 3 *will* be re-examined, the passage states this will happen in 2015/2016, not immediately.
* **C: 緊急立法會議 (Emergency legislative session)** - The passage doesn't mention an emergency session.
* **D: 禁止同性民事結合 (Ban on same-sex civil unions)** - The *failure* of the proposal to ban them means this won't happen.



"
根據文章，第二條文是什麼時候被刪除的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在立法會議期間 (During the legislative session)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""本立法會期對該修正案進行修正，先經眾議院刪除第二條文..."" which translates to ""This legislative session, the amendment was revised, first with the House of Representatives deleting the second clause...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2011 年 (2011)** - The amendment was *proposed* in 2011, but the second clause wasn't deleted then.
* **C: 在星期一 (On Monday)** - The Senate passed a similar version on Monday, but the deletion of the second clause happened *before* that.
* **D: 2015 年 (2015)** - The amendment will be reviewed again in 2015 or 2016, not when the clause was deleted.



"
「巴拿馬文件」洩露給誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 新聞媒體 (News media)**.

The passage states: ""巴拿馬文件 ...外洩給媒體的文件"" which translates to ""the Panama Papers... documents leaked **to the media**"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 莫薩克·馮賽卡事務所 (Mossack Fonseca firm)** - The firm *owned* the documents, they didn't receive the leak.
*   **C: 德意志銀行 (Deutsche Bank)** - Deutsche Bank was mentioned as a client involved in the papers, not the recipient of the leak.
*   **D: 冰島政府領導人 (Icelandic government leaders)** - They were impacted *by* the leak, they didn't receive it.



"
根據文章，英國媒體聲稱誰在管理許多用於藏匿財富的公司？,"The correct answer is **C: 德意志銀行**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""英國報紙《衛報》暗指，用於實現此目的的 1,200 間空殼公司裡，德意志銀行控制了大約三分之一。"" (The British newspaper *The Guardian* hinted that Deutsche Bank controlled about a third of the 1,200 shell companies used to achieve this purpose.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 各大銀行的富有客戶 (Rich clients of major banks)** - While the documents *involved* rich clients, the question asks who was managing the companies, and the passage points to Deutsche Bank.
*   **B: 巴拿馬律師事務所 (Panama law firm)** - The law firm *leaked* the documents, but didn't control the shell companies.
*   **D: 巴基斯坦政府 (Pakistani government)** - The passage states the prime minister of Pakistan resigned *because* of the scandal, not that they were managing the companies.



"
以下哪一次航空事故造成的死亡人數最多？,"The correct answer is **A: 從伊朗飛往亞美尼亞的班機失事**.

Here's why:

The text states that the flight to Armenia had **168 people die** in the crash, which is described as the worst air disaster in years for Iran. The other options have significantly lower death tolls:

*   **B: 警用直升機墜毀** - 3 deaths
*   **C: 從亞美尼亞飛往伊朗的班機失事** - The text does not mention this event.
*   **D: 在馬什哈德發生的飛機失事** - 17 deaths"
以下哪一項不是伊朗發生多起航空事故的原因之一？,"The correct answer is **B: 沒有預算購買新飛機**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states international sanctions prevent buying new planes, not a lack of budget.** While a lack of budget could *contribute* to the problem, the explicit cause given is the sanctions.
* **A: 老舊的民用和軍用飛機機隊** - This is directly stated in the first sentence.
* **C: 制裁禁止購買新飛機** -  This is also directly stated in the first sentence.
* **D: 飛機機隊維護不良** - The phrase ""年久失修"" (nian jiu shi xiu) directly translates to ""dilapidated due to disrepair"" meaning maintenance is lacking.

Therefore, the passage doesn't mention a lack of budget as a cause, only sanctions."
以下哪一項不包括在伊拉克研究小組的報告中？,"The correct answer is **B: 聲明透過某些改變就能避免伊拉克的暴力局勢加劇**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states the report *warns that no one can guarantee* any course of action will prevent sectarian war, growing violence, or chaos.** This directly contradicts option B, which suggests the report believes changes *will* prevent these things.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and found within the passage:

* **A: 批評現行政策** - The passage explicitly says the report ""大力抨擊了行政機構現行對伊拉克政策的幾乎所有面向."" (strongly criticized almost all aspects of the administration’s current Iraq policy)
* **C: 保護伊拉克邊境的建議** - The passage states the first of 78 recommendations is to ""應在今年年底前採行新的外交措施，以保護伊拉克的邊境."" (take new diplomatic initiatives by the end of the year to secure Iraq’s borders)
* **D: 呼籲美國達成共識** - The report ""開頭先請求美國針對中東政策進行公開辯論並形成共識."" (began by requesting an open debate and consensus on U.S. Middle East policy)



"
伊拉克研究小組的報告中未敦促以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **A: 宣布保證阻止持續成長的暴力事件**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the report *warns* that no one can *guarantee* action will stop the violence.**  It specifically says they can't promise to prevent it. Options B, C, and D are all things the report *does* advocate for:
    * **B: 立即改變政策方向** - The report ""strongly urges an immediate change in direction.""
    * **C: 使用公開辯論** - The report *begins* by requesting a public debate on Middle East policy.
    * **D: 建立新的外交措施** - The first of 78 recommendations is to implement new diplomatic initiatives.

Therefore, the report does **not** urge a guarantee that violence will be stopped."
根據警方，誰被認為是普羅文察諾的左右手？,"The correct answer is **B: 洛·皮科洛**.

The passage states: ""警方說，洛·皮科洛之所以佔了上風是因為他在巴勒莫曾擔任普羅文察諾的左右手..."" This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 喬凡尼·法爾康** - He was a victim of the Mafia, not Provenzano's right-hand man.
*   **C: 安莎通訊社 (Ansa)** - This is the news agency reporting the information, not a person within the Mafia.
*   **D: 保羅·波賽里尼** - He was also a victim of the Mafia, not Provenzano's right-hand man.



"
根據文章提供的資訊，喬凡尼·法爾康的死因是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: He was killed in the war initiated by Riina**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...when Riina ended the conflict against the state in 1992, which took the lives of anti-mafia fighters Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino."" This directly links Falcone's death to the conflict started by Riina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: He was killed by the police** - The passage doesn't mention police involvement in his death.
*   **C: Lo Piccolo was ordered to kill him** - The passage doesn't say Lo Piccolo was involved in Falcone's murder.
*   **D: He was killed by anti-mafia fighter Paolo Borsellino** - Borsellino was also a victim of the conflict and not the perpetrator.



"
以下何者不是齊藤仁的榮譽之一？,"正確答案是 **D: 柔道專家**。

文章中提到齊藤仁是：

*   兩屆奧運金牌得主
*   前奧運會和世界冠軍
*   全日本柔道連盟培訓委員會的主席

雖然齊藤仁毫無疑問是柔道專家，但文章並沒有明確列出這是一個他的榮譽或頭銜。 其他選項都在文章中被明確指出。"
岩崎想辦法避開在哪裡立下誓約？,"The correct answer is **B: 尼泊爾**.

The passage states that 岩崎圭一 ""escaped from a marriage in Nepal"". This directly answers the question of where he tried to avoid a commitment (a marriage vow).
"
誰攻擊了岩崎？,"The correct answer is **C: 一隻狗**.

The passage states: ""他在西藏被一隻患有狂犬病的狗攻擊"" (He was attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet).
"
阿隆索在何時結束了他的比賽？,"The correct answer is **A: 在舒馬克損壞前輪後 (After Schumacher damaged his front wheel)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""費爾南多·阿隆索在大部分的賽程都領先，但一離開維修站，他的賽事也跟著告終，大概是因為右前輪沒裝好。"" (Fernando Alonso led for most of the race, but his race ended as soon as he left the pits, probably due to a poorly fitted front right wheel.)

Then, it says: ""麥可・舒馬克在阿隆索出局後不久，也因為在比賽中多次與對手競速，造成懸吊系統損壞而結束了比賽。"" (Michael Schumacher ended his race shortly after Alonso was out, due to suspension damage caused by racing with opponents.)

This clearly indicates Alonso's race ended *before* Schumacher's, and specifically, Schumacher's accident happened *shortly after* Alonso's. Therefore, the best answer is A, as it states Alonso's race ended before Schumacher damaged his wheel.
"
是什麼原因導致舒馬克提前結束比賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 汽車懸吊系統損壞 (Automobile suspension damage)**.

The passage specifically states: ""麥可・舒馬克在阿隆索出局後不久，也因為在比賽中多次與對手競速，造成懸吊系統損壞而結束了比賽。"" (Michael Schumacher ended his race shortly after Alonso's exit, due to damage to the suspension system caused by repeatedly racing with opponents during the race.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 他無法控制車輛 (He couldn't control the vehicle)** - This happened to Sancarlo Fisichella, not Schumacher.
*   **B: 與阿隆索發生碰撞 (Collision with Alonso)** - The passage doesn't mention a collision between Schumacher and Alonso.
*   **C: 費希切拉造成的車輪損壞 (Wheel damage caused by Fisichella)** - Fisichella's issue was losing control of the car, not causing damage to Schumacher's car.



"
根據文章，誰負責為被捕人士決定保釋金？,"The correct answer is **D: 法院臨時法官 (Court assistant judge)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""If approved, **the court assistant judge** will determine the bail amount and formally process the charges presented by the arresting officer."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 逮捕警員 (Arresting officer):** The text says they *present* the charges, but not decide bail.
*   **B: 葛林法官 (Judge Greene):** Judge Greene issued the restraining order, but doesn't determine bail.
*   **C: 中央懲處中心 (Central Detention Center):** The center released the people, but doesn't set bail.



"
根據文中提到的臨時禁制令，被捕人士必須達到什麼條件才能被拘留超過 24 小時？,"The correct answer is **C: 由葛林法官發布的正式指控 (Formal charges issued by Judge Green)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the temporary injunction *requires* release of those held for over 24 hours **without court notification of a preliminary hearing**. This implies that to be legally held beyond 24 hours, there needs to be formal charges filed and a hearing scheduled - essentially a notification from the court.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 保釋金 (Bail)**: The passage mentions bail is *determined* at the hearing, not a requirement *for* continued detention.
*   **B: 與逮捕警員會面 (Meeting with the arresting officer)**: This is not mentioned as a requirement.
*   **D: 聽證會 (Hearing)**: The hearing happens *after* the 24-hour period if someone is still detained; it’s not a prerequisite for detention.



"
根據這段文字，沒有使用以下哪個原因來解釋取消決選？,"The correct answer is **B: 與憲法牴觸 (Violates the constitution)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""外交人員說他們已在阿富汗憲法中找到足夠的歧義，因此決定沒有必要進行決選投票。 這與之前的報告互相矛盾，後者曾表示取消第二輪選舉將違反憲法。"" (Diplomats say they have found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to decide a runoff vote is not necessary. This contradicts earlier reports which said cancelling the second round would violate the constitution.)

This explicitly says that *previous* reports claimed cancellation *would* violate the constitution, but the current decision is based on finding ambiguity *around* that issue.  They are *using* the constitution (or its lack of clarity) as justification, not stating it's a violation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, and therefore *not* the answer:

* **A: 安全風險 (Security risks):** The text directly states ""並避免再次選舉產生的安全風險"" (and avoid security risks from another election).
* **C: 高昂的開支 (High costs):** The text directly states ""以為阿富汗節省經費"" (to save Afghanistan money).
* **D: 憲法的不明確性 (Ambiguity in the constitution):** The text directly states ""在阿富汗憲法中找到足夠的歧義"" (found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution).



"
為什麼外交官最終認為決選投票是沒有必要的？,"The correct answer is **C: 憲法存在不明確的地方 (The constitution has ambiguities)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""外交人員說他們已在阿富汗憲法中找到足夠的歧義，因此決定沒有必要進行決選投票 (Diplomats said they found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to determine a runoff was not necessary).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 這違反了憲法 (This violates the constitution):** The passage actually says the decision was made *because* of interpretations of the constitution, and initially it was reported that cancelling the election *would* violate it.
* **B: 有安全風險 (There are security risks):** While security risks were a reason given for wanting to cancel the election, it wasn't the reason diplomats decided it wasn't *necessary*.
* **D: 選舉花費太昂貴 (The election is too expensive):**  Cost was a factor in the official decision, but the diplomats based their reasoning on constitutional interpretation.



"
誰為聯邦直轄部落地區提供司法服務？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治代理人 (Political Agents)**.

The passage explicitly states that political agents, appointed by the President, were responsible for *governing and providing judicial services* to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 巴基斯坦政府 (Pakistan Government)** - While the political agents were appointed by the President (part of the government), the agents themselves directly provided the services.
*   **C: 巴基斯坦總統 (Pakistan President)** - The President *appointed* the political agents, but didn't directly provide judicial services.
*   **D: 英國政府 (British Government)** - Pakistan gained independence from British rule in 1947, so the British government would not be providing services post-independence.



"
關於聯邦直轄部落地區「政治代理人」的敘述，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **C: They abide by the Pakistan Constitution**.

Here's why:

The passage states that political agents had *almost complete autonomy* and were responsible for governance and judicial services. However, it **doesn't** say they operate *under* or are bound *by* the Pakistani Constitution. In fact, the historical context (and further knowledge beyond the text) indicates that the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) operated under a separate legal framework rooted in British colonial-era laws, not directly subject to the full force of the Pakistani Constitution.  The system was largely designed to be independent, though accountable to the President.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

*   **A: They are responsible for providing judicial services:** The text explicitly states this (""responsible for governance *and providing judicial services*"").
*   **B: They are selected by the President of Pakistan:** The text states they are ""appointed by the President.""
*   **D: They have almost complete control over specific areas:** The text says they have ""almost complete autonomy"" in these regions.



"
請問艾瑪·史東被提名哪個獎項？,"The correct answer is **C: 最佳女演員 (Best Actress)**.

The passage states: ""雷恩‧葛斯林和艾瑪‧史東分別獲提名為最佳男主角和最佳女主角"" which translates to ""Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively.""
"
該電影沒有被提名哪個獎項？,"The correct answer is **B: 最佳視覺效果**.

Here's why:

The passage lists all the awards the movie *was* nominated for.  ""最佳視覺效果"" (Best Visual Effects) is **not** on that list. The other options (最佳影片, 最佳混音, 最佳原創歌曲) are all mentioned as nominations in the text.
"
地震後，哪些設施繼續運作？,"The correct answer is **D: 新潟的一座發電廠 (A power plant in Niigata)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states ""位於新潟縣的柏崎刈羽核能發電廠當時運作正常 (the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture was operating normally at the time)"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 北陸電力公司志賀核電廠所有的反應爐 (All reactors at Hokuriku Electric Power's Shiga Nuclear Power Plant)** - The text says reactors 1 and 2 were *shut down*.
*   **B: 石川縣的機場 (The airport in Ishikawa Prefecture)** - The text states the airport *remains closed*.
*   **C: 所有的鐵路服務 (All railway services)** - The text states railway services were *disrupted*.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者因地震受損？,"The correct answer is **A: 部分民宅 (Some homes)**, **C: 部分道路 (Some roads)** and **D: 能登機場 (Noto Airport)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 部分民宅 (Some homes):** The text explicitly states ""在此地區約有 9400 戶民宅斷水，100 戶民宅斷電"" (Approximately 9400 homes have no water, and 100 homes have no electricity). This indicates damage to homes.
* **C: 部分道路 (Some roads):** The text says ""部分道路已受損"" (Some roads are damaged).
* **D: 能登機場 (Noto Airport):** The text states ""而石川縣的能登機場依舊關閉"" (Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture remains closed).  Closure implies damage or safety concerns resulting from the earthquake.

* **B: 兩座北陸電力公司志賀核電廠反應爐 (Two reactors at the Shiga Nuclear Power Plant of Hokuriku Electric Power Company):** The text says the reactors are *closed* (""志賀核能發電廠的一號和二號反應爐也關閉了""), but not *damaged*. They were shut down as a precaution.



"
根據這段文字，文件中沒有包含以下哪個問題？,"The correct answer is **B: 1967 年戰爭的原因**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the document mentions:**
    *   The border dispute based on the 1967 borders (D)
    *   The future of Jerusalem (A)
    *   The issue of the Jordan Valley and troop presence (C)

*   **The passage does *not* discuss:**
    *   The *causes* of the 1967 war. It only mentions the war as a reference point for the borders.

Therefore, option B is the topic not included in the document according to the provided text."
下列何者並非巴勒斯坦的要求？,"The correct answer is **B: 繼續在約旦河谷駐軍**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that *Israel* requests to continue military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, and the Palestinian Authority *agrees* to five years.**  Therefore, continuing a military presence in the Jordan Valley is not a Palestinian request, but something they are negotiating on *in response to* an Israeli request.
* **A: 以戰前邊界為基礎 (Based on pre-war borders)** - The passage explicitly states Palestinians want this.
* **C: 有關耶路撒冷的未來的答案 (Answers regarding the future of Jerusalem)** - The passage mentions this is a topic in the documents.
* **D: 在約旦河谷持續五年的駐軍 (Five years of continued military presence in the Jordan Valley)** - The passage states Palestinians *agree* to this, so it's part of their negotiation position.

"
馬英九在哪個國家學法律？,"The correct answer is **A: 美國**.

The text states 馬英九 (Ma Ying-jeou) studied at 哈佛法學院 (Harvard Law School) and 紐約大學 (New York University), both of which are in the United States. Therefore, he studied law in the US.
"
根據這段文字，馬英九因擁護哪個國家所助得以勝選？,"The correct answer is **D: 中國**.

Here's why:

The text states that 馬英九 (Ma Ying-jeou) won ""by easily advocating for policies to form closer ties with mainland China."" This directly indicates that his pro-China stance contributed to his victory.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 美國 (United States)** - While the text mentions his education and past residency in the US, it doesn't say this helped him win. In fact, the accusations suggest it could have been used *against* him.
*   **B: 香港 (Hong Kong)** - His birthplace is mentioned, but not as a factor in his success.
*   **C: 英國 (United Kingdom)** - The text does not mention the UK.



"
在文章中提到，Carolyn Wilson 離開小鎮前為誰工作？,"The correct answer is **C: 奧克蘭房屋委員會**.

The passage states: ""...奧克蘭房屋委員會的 Carolyn Wilson 偷走他們的保證金並已捲款潛逃。"" ( ""...Carolyn Wilson of the Oakland Housing Authority stole their deposits and fled."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 東灣社區法律中心** - The East Bay Community Law Center *held* the hearing, but Carolyn Wilson didn't work there.
* **B: 奧克蘭警方** - The Oakland police are *investigating* the fraud, but Carolyn Wilson didn't work for them.
* **D: 洛克伍德花園** - Lockwood Gardens is where the tenants live; Carolyn Wilson didn't work *for* the complex itself.



"
在賽季仍剩四場賽事的情況下，誰在車手錦標賽排名第四？,"The correct answer is **C: 史都華**.

Here's how we can deduce that from the passage:

*   The passage states that after the race, Kesselovsky is first, Johnson is second, Hamlin is third, and then lists Kahn and Chukus as fifth and sixth respectively.
*   It then states that **Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth, and Harvick** occupy positions 7 through 10.
*   Since Hamlin is third, and the passage states Stewart is *among* those in positions 7-10, and that they occupy the Top 10, we know the fourth position must be filled by one of the names listed in the following sentence, namely, **Stewart**.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
文中提到比賽結束後，卡恩在車手錦標賽中獲得多少分？,"The correct answer is **A: 2220 分**.

The text states: ""卡恩和小楚克斯分別以 2220 分和 2207 分位居第五和第六名."" which translates to ""Kahn and Chucks scored 2220 and 2207 points respectively, ranking fifth and sixth.""

Therefore, Kahn scored 2220 points.

根據這段文字，人類看到掉落的隕石，後來證實是來自火星的情況有幾次？,"The correct answer is **B: 5 次**.

The passage states: ""據信這是史上第五次人類發現並經由化學方式證明有火星物質掉落到地球上。"" (It is believed to be the fifth time in history that humans have discovered and chemically proven Martian material has fallen to Earth.)
"
如文中所提，關於已發現是來自火星的岩石，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 共有 34 個 (There are 34 of them)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""地球上將近兩萬四千顆已知的隕石中，只有 34 顆確定來自火星。"" (Out of nearly 24,000 known meteorites on Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to be from Mars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 全都是在七月的流星雨期間發現的 (All were discovered during the July meteor shower):** The passage states *fifteen* rocks came from the July meteor shower, not all 34.
* **B: 共有 24000 個 (There are 24,000 of them):** 24,000 is the *total* number of known meteorites, not just Martian ones.
* **C: 其價值比黃金還要高出 $11000 美元 (Their value is $11,000 more than gold):** The passage states the price is 10 *times* the price of gold, not $11,000 more. While the price per ounce is between $11,000 and $22,500, that doesn't mean the difference between Martian rock and gold is a flat $11,000.



"
舒馬克是何時退休的？,"The correct answer is **B: 在他第七次贏得冠軍之後**.

The passage states: ""曾七度贏得一級方程式冠軍，已於 2006 年退休的舒馬克..."" (Having won the Formula One championship seven times, Schumacher retired in 2006...) 

While the passage *also* mentions Massa's accident and Schumacher potentially replacing him, it doesn't say Schumacher retired *because* of Massa's accident. It clearly states he retired in 2006 after his seventh championship.
"
馬薩是何時受傷的？,"The correct answer is **A: 參加大獎賽途中 (during a Grand Prix)**.

The text states: ""馬薩在 2009 年匈牙利大獎賽中遭遇車禍 (Massa was involved in an accident during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix)."" This means he was injured while participating in a race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 贏得一級方程式冠軍後 (after winning a Formula One championship)** - The text doesn't mention this.
* **C: 舒馬克退休前 (before Schumacher retired)** - The accident happened in 2009, after Schumacher retired in 2006.
* **D: 2009 年賽季前 (before the 2009 season)** - The accident happened *during* the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, which is part of the 2009 season.
"
根據這段文字，這個安排會如何影響 AOL？,"The correct answer is **C: 雅虎和微軟客戶加總將可匹敵 AOL 的客戶數量**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""雅虎和微軟服務的使用者人數加總，將可匹敵 AOL 的客戶數量"" (The combined number of Yahoo and Microsoft users will be able to rival AOL's customer base).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL 的客戶數量可能會增加 (AOL's customer base may increase):** The passage doesn't suggest AOL's *own* customer base will increase, only that its dominance will be challenged.
* **B: AOL 將是唯一開發即時通訊市場的公司 (AOL will be the only company developing the instant messaging market):** The passage clearly indicates competition from Yahoo and Microsoft.
* **D: AOL 將不再在美國使用 (AOL will no longer be used in the US):** The passage talks about a change in AOL's *position* in the market, not its complete removal from the US.



"
以下何者可能會於新安排後結束？,"The correct answer is **C: AOL 自主發展市場的自由 (AOL's freedom to develop the market at its own pace)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Under such an arrangement, this freedom might come to an end.""  ""This freedom"" refers to AOL's ability to develop the instant messaging market ""at its own pace"" due to its large user base in the US.
* **The passage explains:** Yahoo and Microsoft together will have a user base comparable to AOL, meaning AOL will no longer have a dominant position allowing it to dictate the market's direction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 美國普遍的網路發展 (Widespread internet development in the US):** The passage doesn't suggest anything about the overall growth of the internet being affected.
* **B: 即時通訊市場的使用 (The use of instant messaging):**  The passage focuses on *who* controls the market, not whether people will *use* instant messaging.
* **D: 雅虎和微軟的合作夥伴關係 (Yahoo and Microsoft's partnership):** The passage *describes* a new arrangement involving Yahoo and Microsoft, but doesn't imply their partnership will end.



"
在攻擊中喪生的人有多少個不是警察？,"The correct answer is **C: 0 人**.

Here's why:

* The text states two police officers died.
* It also states 19 of the injured were police officers.
* It doesn't mention any civilians (non-police) dying. Therefore, zero people who were not police officers lost their lives in the attack."
是誰舉報攻擊事件的嫌疑犯？,"The correct answer is **A: 警方 (Police)**.

The text states: ""警方說，他們懷疑這起攻擊是由達伊沙（伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯蘭國）的好戰嫌疑犯所為。"" (Police said they suspect the attack was carried out by militants of ISIS.) This directly indicates the police are the ones reporting the suspicion regarding the perpetrators.
"
由於佛羅里達州是一個贏者全拿的州，米特·羅姆尼贏得了什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 該州的所有代表**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""作為贏者全拿的州，佛羅里達州的五十名代表全數歸予羅姆尼"". This directly answers the question. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 名州代表** - This is the percentage Newt Gingrich received, not what Romney won.
*   **B: 共和黨提名** - The passage states Romney became the *leading* contender for the nomination, not that he *won* it.
*   **D: 46% 的選票** - This is the percentage of votes Romney received, but the question asks what he *won* due to the winner-take-all system.



"
根據這段文字，金瑞契在初選中獲得了多少百分比的選票？,"The correct answer is **B: 0.32**

The text states: ""Newt Gingrich received 32% of the vote, finishing second."" 

Therefore, the answer is 0.32."
根據這段文字，在公布預選會議結果之後，誰沒有繼續競選？,"The correct answer is **B: 巴克曼 (Bachmann)**.

The text states: ""巴赫曼在八月份的埃姆斯民意調查中獲勝，並決定終止競選。"" (Bachmann won the Ames straw poll in August and decided to end her campaign.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 金瑞契 (Gingrich)** - He congratulated Santorum and criticized Romney, but continued his campaign.
*   **C: 裴利 (Perry)** - He initially considered dropping out but ultimately decided to continue.
*   **D: 羅姆尼 (Romney)** - He was criticized by Gingrich, but the text does not state he dropped out of the race.



"
根據這段文字，在公布預選會議結果之後，誰對另一位候選人給予了高度評價？,"The correct answer is **B: 金瑞契 (Gingrich)**.

The text states: ""金瑞契恭賀桑托榮 (Gingrich congratulated Santorum)."" This means Gingrich gave a positive assessment (congratulated) another candidate after the results were announced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 巴克曼 (Bachmann)** - She *ended* her campaign, not offered praise.
*   **C: 羅姆尼 (Romney)** - Gingrich criticized Romney, not praised him.
*   **D: 裴利 (Perry)** - Perry was assessing his chances and later decided to continue, but didn't offer praise to another candidate.



"
在 2015 年之前，唯一播出該節目的地方在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet 網路電台**.

The text states: ""早期，這個節目只有在一個經營許久的網路電台 TogiNet 上播出..."" (Early on, the show only aired on a long-running internet radio station, TogiNet...). 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 東德州** - The text mentions actors *from* East Texas, but not that the show aired *in* East Texas.
* **C: AstroNet 電台** - AstroNet was created *in* late 2015, meaning it wasn't around *before* 2015.
* **D: 當地廣播電台** - The show aired on an *internet* radio station, not a local broadcast radio station.



"
該電台描述節目具有什麼樣的反轉？,"The correct answer is **B: 古怪 (quirky)**.

The radio station's website describes the show as having ""extremely quirky twists."" The other options are descriptive of *other* aspects of the show, but not the twists themselves:

*   **業餘 (amateur)** describes the voice actors.
*   **老派 (old-fashioned)** describes the overall style of the show (""old-timey radio drama"").
*   **本土 (local)** describes the origin of the voice actors.



"
大衛·韓德利收集了什麼，最終促成激進組織的攻擊行動？,"The correct answer is **A: 資訊**.

The passage specifically states: ""David Headley’s reconnaissance and information gathering led to the attacks..."" This means he collected information that enabled the attacks to happen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 手榴彈 (Hand grenades):** The passage states the attackers *carried* hand grenades, but doesn’t say Headley collected them.
* **C: 槍手 (Gunmen):** Headley didn't gather the gunmen, he gathered information *about* the targets for them.
* **D: 自動武器 (Automatic weapons):** Similar to hand grenades, Headley didn’t collect the weapons.



"
激進組織搭乘哪種交通工具前往孟買？,"The correct answer is **C: 船**.

The passage explicitly states: ""孟買恐攻者在 2008 年 11 月 26 日**搭船抵達**..."" (The Mumbai attackers arrived by **boat** on November 26, 2008...).
"
關於文中提到的納達爾與拉奧尼奇在布里斯本公開賽，哪一種敘述能正確表達出他們交手的結果？,"The correct answer is **A: 拉奧尼奇擊敗納達爾 (Raonic defeated Nadal)**.

The text states: ""He recently lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open."" This directly indicates that Raonic won the match against Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 拉奧尼奇拿下了 88% 的網前分 (Raonic won 88% of net points)** - The text says Nadal won 88% of net points, not Raonic.
*   **C: 納達爾擊敗拉奧尼奇 (Nadal defeated Raonic)** - This is the opposite of what the text states.
*   **D: 拉奧尼奇贏得 76 分 (Raonic won 76 points)** - The text states Nadal won 76 points on his serve, not Raonic overall."
根據這段文字，納達爾和拉奧尼奇在比賽首發後的戰績如何？,"The correct answer is **D: 拉奧尼奇擊敗納達爾 (Raonic defeated Nadal)**.

The text states: ""He recently lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open."" This directly indicates Raonic won the match against Nadal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 拉奧尼奇拿下了 88% 的網前分 (Raonic won 88% of net points)** - The text says Nadal won 88% of net points, not Raonic.
*   **B: 納達爾贏得 76 分 (Nadal won 76 points)** - While true, this doesn't answer the question about the *outcome* of the match.
*   **C: 比分是 7-2 (The score is 7-2)** - This refers to Nadal's overall record *against a Canadian player*, not against Raonic specifically.



"
裸體新聞的三個新廣播節目中，不包括哪種語言的節目？,"The correct answer is **C: 日語**.

The passage states that Nude News *already* has English and Japanese reporting. It is *adding* Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is not one of the *new* programs.
"
根據這段文字，哪裡不會播出裸體新聞的新廣播節目？,"The correct answer is **C: 劇院**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the new programs will be launched on **television, the web, and mobile devices**. It doesn't mention theaters. 

Therefore, theaters are the only option *not* listed as a platform for the new broadcasts.
"
有多少參賽者沒有完成大迴轉賽？,"The question asks for the number of participants who did not finish the giant slalom. The text states that 45 participants did not receive a ranking in the giant slalom out of 117 skiers. This means 45 skiers did not complete the giant slalom.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: 45 人**.
"
以下哪項陳述正確表達了錦標賽賽事的結果？,"Let's analyze each option based on the given text:

* **A: 在第二場比賽中，卡潘內多在匈牙利滑雪者之前完成比賽** (In the second competition, Carpanedo finished before the Hungarian skier).  The text says Carpanedo was 1:09.02 *slower* than Gyöngyi Dani (the Hungarian skier), meaning Dani finished *before* Carpanedo. So this is **incorrect**.

* **B: 在大迴轉賽中，有 45 名滑雪者沒有完成比賽** (In the giant slalom, 45 skiers did not finish). The text states ""In the giant slalom of 117 skiers, 45 did not rank.""  Not ranking directly implies not finishing the race. So this is **correct**.

* **C: 完成大迴轉賽的滑雪者人數多於小迴轉賽** (The number of skiers who finished the giant slalom is more than the slalom).  The text says 116 skiers started the slalom, and 36 had the same result as Carpanedo (DNF). This implies many did *not* finish.  The giant slalom had 117 starters and 45 did not rank. We don't have exact finish numbers for either, but it's unlikely the slalom had more finishers given the number of DNFs.  It's plausible, but we can't definitively say it's true.

* **D: 卡潘內多在小迴轉賽中獲得第十名** (Carpanedo finished tenth in the slalom). The text clearly states she did *not* finish (DNF) the slalom. So this is **incorrect**.

Therefore, the best answer is **B**.
"
美國國家籃球協會 (NBA) 決定暫停以下何者的活動？,"The correct answer is **A: 籃球賽季 (basketball season)**.

The passage explicitly states the NBA ""announced the suspension of its professional basketball season."" The other options are related to the situation, but not what was *suspended*.
"
根據這段文字，是什麼引發了美國國家籃球協會對病毒的擔憂？,"The correct answer is **D: 一名猶他爵士隊球員確診新冠病毒**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""一名猶他爵士隊球員確診新冠病毒之後，NBA 做出此決定。"" (After a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19, the NBA made this decision.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 美國國家籃球協會成員確診新冠病毒** - While true, it's not specific enough. The passage highlights *which* member triggered the concern.
* **B: 幾名球員在猶他爵士隊的比賽中確診新冠病毒** - The passage only mentions *one* player.
* **C: 一名猶他爵士隊的球員在確診新冠病毒後表現不佳** - The passage doesn't mention the player's performance.  It focuses on the positive test itself.



"
在對陣亞特蘭大鶇鳥的比賽中，誰為華盛頓首都隊射進了致勝球？,"The correct answer is **A: 尼可拉斯·巴克斯卓**.

The passage states: ""Ovechkin’s first assist of the night came on a game-winning goal by rookie **Nikolas Backstrom**;"" 

Therefore, Nikolas Backstrom scored the game-winning goal for the Washington Capitals."
在首都隊對陣亞特蘭大鶇鳥的比賽中，誰射進了他本賽季的第 60 個進球？,"The correct answer is **C: 亞歷克斯·歐維契金**.

The passage states: ""His second goal of the night was his 60th of the season, making him the first player to score 60 or more goals in a single season since 1995-96."" This clearly indicates that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 馬里奧·拉謬** and **B: 亞羅米爾·佳格** were players who reached the 60-goal milestone *in* 1995-96, but didn't score in the game described.
*   **D: 尼可拉斯·巴克斯卓** scored the winning goal with an assist from Ovechkin, but didn't score Ovechkin's 60th goal.



"
北岩銀行何時需要政府支援？,"The correct answer is **D: 房貸危機期間**.

Here's why:

The text states ""North Rock requested assistance after being affected by the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis."" This directly links the need for support to the crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 銀行國有化後** - The bank *received* support *leading up to* nationalization, not after.
*   **B: 銀行從資產管理公司分離出來之時** - This happened *after* the initial crisis and government support.
*   **C: 維珍集團收購銀行後** - Virgin Group did *not* acquire the bank; their offer was rejected.



"
根據這段文字，關於維珍集團與北岩銀行的交易，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 維珍集團在銀行國有化後收購了該銀行** (Virgin Group acquired the bank after it was nationalized).

Here's why:

* The text states that Virgin Group made an offer *before* the bank was nationalized, but it was rejected.
* It then states that Virgin Group *did* purchase the ""good bank"" portion *after* it was nationalized and separated from ""North Rock (Asset Management)"" (the ""bad bank"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The text explicitly says Virgin Group *did not* buy the asset management company.
* **C:** While Richard Branson's Virgin Group *attempted* to buy the bank, the text doesn't say they provided emergency support. They made an offer to *purchase* it.
* **D:** Virgin Group's initial bid was *before* nationalization, not after.



"
如文中所述，哪個國家受到《京都氣候協定》簽署的影響？,"The correct answer is **A: 美國 (United States)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Kevin Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol ""will leave the United States isolated"" and that the US will be ""the only developed nation not to have ratified the agreement."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 印度 (India):** The passage states India *wasn't* bound by emissions targets.
*   **C: 澳洲 (Australia):** The passage states Australia's *previous* conservative government *rejected* ratification, but now *has* signed it.
*   **D: 中國 (China):**  The passage states China *wasn't* bound by emissions targets.



"
澳洲前政府認為批准《京都氣候協定》會對什麼造成傷害？,"The correct answer is **B: 該國的經濟**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""澳洲前保守派政府拒絕批准《京都議定書》，聲稱其會對高度依賴煤炭出口的經濟造成損害..."" This directly links the previous government's refusal to the potential harm to the *economy*. While coal exports are mentioned, they are presented as *why* the economy would be harmed, not the harm itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 美國** - The passage focuses on Australia's decision and its effect on the US's isolation, not harm *to* the US.
*   **C: 煤炭出口** - Coal exports are the *reason* for the potential harm, not the harm itself.
*   **D: 該國的碳排放指標** - The passage doesn't mention concerns about Australia's carbon emission targets.



"
控制補強試驗的狩獵者是為哪個計畫招募的？,"The correct answer is **D: 射擊運動協會的狩獵計劃**.

The passage states: ""NPWS 與澳洲射擊運動協會 (NSW) 合作，在射擊運動協會的狩獵計畫下招攬了符合資格的志工."" This directly states the hunters were recruited under the shooting association's hunting program.
"
哪種說法不能正確表達害蟲控制試驗？,"The correct answer is **A: 由於此為該計劃的首次試驗，因此未進行評估**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...related agencies need to monitor and evaluate the performance of the trial."" This directly contradicts option A, indicating that evaluation *is* happening.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and supported by the text:

* **B: 狩獵者受過訓練指導:**  The passage states, ""The four shooters selected for the first shoot have received thorough safety and training instruction.""
* **C: 狩獵者受國家公園管理員監督:** The passage states, ""Hunters participating in the harmful animal control reinforcement trial will be closely supervised by National Parks staff...""
* **D: 有四名狩獵者被選中:** The passage states, ""The four shooters selected...""



"
根據這段文字，裂谷是在哪裡發現的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在東非大裂谷 (In the East African Rift Valley)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions ""Ethiopian 'Rift Valley Research Service',"" and ""裂谷 (rift valley)"" directly. This refers to the East African Rift Valley, a well-known geological feature in East Africa where many important hominid fossils have been found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 在化石上 (On the fossil):** The rift valley is where the fossil was *found*, not *on* the fossil itself.
*   **C: 在分子證據中 (In molecular evidence):** Molecular evidence is a separate type of data used in evolutionary studies, not a location.
*   **D: 在衣索比亞 (In Ethiopia):** While the research service is *based* in Ethiopia, the rift valley extends beyond just Ethiopia - it is the *East African* Rift Valley. While it's true the rift valley goes through Ethiopia, option A is the more complete and accurate answer.



"
根據這段文字，什麼事情發生的時間比預料的更早？,"The correct answer is **A: 化石的發現 (The discovery of the fossil)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""According to this fossil, that means the evolutionary split is much earlier than predicted by molecular evidence."" 
* This directly indicates that the *fossil* discovery (and therefore, what it represents - the evolutionary split) is happening earlier than expected based on previous *molecular evidence*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 裂谷 (Rift Valley)**: The Rift Valley is the *location* of the discovery, not something whose timing is being discussed.
* **C: 分子證據分析 (Molecular evidence analysis)**: The passage states that the evolutionary split is *earlier than* the molecular evidence suggests, not that the analysis itself is early.
* **D: 東非大裂谷的研究 (Research on the East African Great Rift Valley)**: This is a general area of study, not a specific event with a timing.



"
玩家要做什麼才能在電子遊戲中控制動作？,"The correct answer is **D: 在空中揮動控制器 (In the air swing the controller)**.

The passage states: ""This will let players control actions and movement in video games by **swinging the device through the air**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 確保控制器的感測器位於遊戲機附近 (Ensure the controller's sensor is near the game console)** - The sensors are near the *TV*, not the console.
* **B: 以三角測量方式測量其位置 (Measure its position by triangulation)** - Triangulation is *how* the system works, but not what the player *does*.
* **C: 將感測器放置在電視附近 (Place the sensor near the TV)** - This is something Nintendo does, not the player.



"
什麼事物被設計成像電視遙控器的模樣？,"The correct answer is **B: 任天堂 Revolution 控制器 (Nintendo Revolution controller)**.

The passage specifically states: ""控制器類似電視遙控器"" (The controller is similar to a TV remote). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 控制器的兩個感測器 (The two sensors of the controller):** The sensors are *used with* the controller, but aren't designed to *look* like a remote.
* **C: 主題演講 (Keynote speech):** The speech announced the controller, but wasn't designed like a remote.
* **D: 任天堂 Revolution 遊戲機 (Nintendo Revolution game console):** The console itself isn't described as looking like a TV remote, it's the *controller* that is.



"
新華社的最新報導中沒有說明什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 飛機降落在烏魯木齊** (The plane landed in Urumqi).

Here's why:

The passage states the initial report said the plane *requested* an emergency landing in Urumqi and was *denied*. The later reports clarify it returned to Afghanistan.  The new reports *don't* say the plane actually landed in Urumqi, only that it was refused.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 飛機收到炸彈威脅** (The plane received a bomb threat) - This *is* mentioned in the later reports.
*   **C: 飛機遭轉回阿富汗** (The plane was diverted back to Afghanistan) - This *is* mentioned in the later reports.
*   **D: 飛機降落在坎大哈** (The plane landed in Kandahar) - This *is* mentioned in the later reports."
新華社最初的報導中沒有說明什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 飛機遭劫持 (The plane was hijacked)**.

The passage states the initial report from Xinhua news agency said the plane was hijacked. Later reports clarified the situation was a bomb threat and the plane was diverted. Therefore, the initial report *didn't* mention the bomb threat, the refusal of landing, or the return to Afghanistan – only the hijacking.
"
莎拉·戴紐斯在廣播節目中公布了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 將不再嘗試聯繫巴布·迪倫 (Will no longer attempt to contact Bob Dylan)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Sarah Danius announced the committee has ""given up trying"" to contact Bob Dylan to arrange for him to receive the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 諾貝爾文學獎得獎者 (Nobel Prize in Literature winners)** - While the passage *mentions* the Nobel Prize, it doesn't announce a new winner.
*   **B: 委員會未收到合作夥伴的回復 (The committee did not receive a reply from collaborators)** - The passage states they *did* receive friendly replies.
*   **C: 2016 年諾貝爾文學獎提名者 (2016 Nobel Prize in Literature nominees)** - The passage doesn't discuss nominees, only the winner (Bob Dylan) and the difficulty in contacting him.



"
戴紐斯無法聯繫到誰？,"The correct answer is **D: 巴布·迪倫 (Bob Dylan)**.

The passage explicitly states the committee was unable to contact Bob Dylan directly to arrange for him to receive the award. While they *did* contact his close associates, the core issue was their inability to reach Dylan himself.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** They *were* able to contact his close collaborators.
*   **B:** Sarah Danius is the one doing the contacting.
*   **C:** The Swedish Academy is the body trying to make contact, not the one being contacted.



"
是誰評論此一承諾是為「一大步」？,"The correct answer is **C: 戈登·喬翰羅 (Gordon Johndroe)**.

The text specifically states that Gordon Johndroe, Bush's spokesperson, called the North Korean commitment ""a significant step"" toward achieving the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
"
斯拉尼亞為多國製作了多少枚郵票？,"The correct answer is **D: 超過 1000 枚 (Over 1000)**.

The passage states he made ""over a thousand stamps"" for Sweden and 28 other countries. Option B (1000) is too specific and doesn't reflect the ""over"" aspect. Options A and C are incorrect as the text doesn't specify numbers that high.
"
根據這段文字，油槽排氣孔持續漏油的可能原因是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 熱膨脹**.

The text states: ""截至週三下午，油槽排氣孔仍在漏油，可能是油槽內部的熱膨脹所致。"" (As of Wednesday afternoon, the tank's vent was still leaking, likely due to thermal expansion inside the tank.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 第二攔油區正在填滿 (The second containment area is filling up)** - The text says the second containment area is *not* yet full.
* **B: 火災指揮系統例行測試 (Routine fire suppression system testing)** - The testing *caused* the initial leak, but isn't the reason the vent continues to leak.
* **D: 格里利堡其中一個泵站發生火災 (A fire at one of the pump stations in Greeley)** - The text mentions a fire *system test*, not an actual fire.



"
為什麼放洩閥會打開？,"The correct answer is **B: 系統測試後發生斷電**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""斷電之後，隨之而來的是常規的火災指揮系統測試，導致放洩閥開啟..."". This clearly establishes a causal link between the power outage, the subsequent system test, and the opening of the relief valve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 油槽內部的熱膨脹** - The passage mentions heat expansion *as a possible reason the leaking continues from the tank vent*, not why the valve initially opened.
*   **C: 油槽已全滿** - The oil tank overflowed *because* the valve opened, not the other way around.
*   **D: 第二攔油區無法容納足夠的桶量** - The passage states the second containment area hasn't *filled* yet, meaning it has capacity, not that it's full.



"
目前第九區的水位有多高？,"The correct answer is **C: 水深及腰 (waist-deep)**.

The passage specifically states: ""目前水深及腰，附近的堤防沒入水中 (Currently the water is waist-deep, nearby levees are submerged).""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 20 英尺 (20 feet)** - This was the height during Hurricane Katrina, not the *current* water level.
*   **B: 6 英吋 (6 inches)** - This is the rainfall amount that could cause further damage, not the current water level.
*   **D: 100 英尺 (100 feet)** - This is the width of the overflow, not the water depth.



"
卡崔娜颶風來襲期間，第九區發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **C: 洪水高達 20 英尺 (flooding reached as high as twenty feet)**.

The passage specifically states: ""卡崔娜颶風來襲時曾水淹高達二十英尺的第九區"" which translates to ""During Hurricane Katrina, the Ninth Ward was flooded to as high as twenty feet.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 洪水寬 100 英尺 (flooding was 100 feet wide)** - While the passage mentions the overflow being 100 feet wide, it doesn't describe *what happened* during Katrina.
*   **B: 及腰的水深淹沒了堤壩 (water was waist-deep, submerging the levees)** - This describes the *current* situation, not what happened *during* Katrina.
*   **D: 6 英吋的降雨量沖毀了受損堤壩 (6 inches of rain destroyed the damaged levees)** - This is a prediction about potential future damage, not what occurred during Katrina.



"
漢密爾頓並未證實以下何者？,"正確答案是 **B: 其他患者感染病毒的可能性**

理由如下：

*   **P 段落** 說的是醫院已經採取措施 *避免* 其他人感染病毒，也就是說，他們還沒有排除其他患者感染的可能性，只是正在努力防止傳播。漢彌爾頓證實了他們正在採取預防措施，而不是證實沒有其他患者感染。

以下解釋為什麼其他選項是錯誤的：

*   **A: 病人曾去過的地方** - P 段落明確指出病人去過奈及利亞。
*   **C: 是否已遵行感染控制的規定** - P 段落明確表示醫院已經遵行感染控制的規定。
*   **D: 患者目前的狀況** - P 段落表明患者病情穩定。

因此，漢彌爾頓證實了 A、C 和 D 的內容，但沒有證實其他患者感染病毒的可能性。"
科學家想瞭解的事情是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 地球是如何形成的 (How Earth was formed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""科學家希望瞭解星球形成的過程，尤其是地球，因為彗星在很久以前曾與地球相撞。"" (Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially Earth, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.)

This directly indicates the scientists' primary interest is in understanding *how Earth formed*, and the cometary impacts are relevant to that understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 彗星何時與地球相撞 (When comets collided with Earth)** - While the passage mentions collisions, the *timing* of those collisions isn't the main focus.
*   **B: 蛋白質是如何形成的 (How proteins are formed)** -  Protein formation is mentioned as a *result* of organic matter, but not the core question the scientists are trying to answer.
*   **C: 什麼是有機物質 (What organic matter is)** - Organic matter is presented as a component brought by comets, but the understanding of what it *is* isn't the primary research goal.



"
根據這段文字，當地警方在關閉隧道中扮演了什麼角色？,"The correct answer is **C: They directed drivers to alternate routes.**

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""...and with the assistance of 80 officers, directed drivers to alternate routes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: They persuaded the FBI to close the tunnel.** The text states the *FBI* persuaded the Maryland Transportation Authority, not the police.
* **B: They decided to close the tunnel.** The Maryland Transportation Authority made the decision.
* **D: They reported severe congestion on alternate routes.** The text says alternate routes did *not* have severe congestion.



"
隧道入口在關閉期間發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: They were blocked off.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Dump trucks were used to block all entrances to the tunnels...**""  This directly answers the question of what happened at the tunnel entrances during the closure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: They were used as alternative routes:** The alternative route was the beltway, not the tunnel entrances themselves.
* **C: They were open to drivers:** The tunnels were *closed*, meaning the entrances weren't open to drivers.
* **D: There was severe congestion ahead:** The beltway, the alternative route, did *not* experience severe congestion.



"
根據這段文字，攝影師被車撞到前沒有發生什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 攝影師被公路巡警命令回到車道對面**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""…促使加州公路巡警的警官兩次執行交通攔停，命令他回到車道對面。"" This directly describes an event happening *before* the photographer was hit by a car.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 攝影師將車停在塞普爾韋達大道上** - While true, this happened *before* the police interaction.
*   **C: 攝影師拍攝了警察攔停點的照片** - He *tried* to, but the text indicates this led to the police stopping him.
*   **D: 攝影師得以拍到了小賈斯汀的照片** - The text doesn't mention anything about the photographer taking pictures of Justin Bieber.



"
攝影師在被車撞到前試圖做什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 拍攝警察攔停點的照片**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""TMZ learned the photographer pulled over on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard, attempting to photograph the police checkpoint before crossing the street and continuing on."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 將車停在塞普爾韋達大道** - While he *did* pull over, that wasn't his goal, it was a step *towards* taking the photo.
*   **C: 穿過繁忙的高速公路** - He was *attempting* to cross, but the photo was the initial action.
*   **D: 說服員警讓他繼續拍攝** - The text doesn't mention any attempt to persuade the officers.



"
關於總理在確診病毒後的狀況，哪種說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: He feels unwell**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""besides fever and sore throat, I feel healthy and in good condition..."" This directly contradicts the statement that he feels unwell.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: He has a sore throat:** The passage explicitly says ""...sore throat...""
*   **C: His condition is stable:** The passage states ""The president is currently in stable condition...""
*   **D: He has a fever:** The passage states ""...besides fever and sore throat..."""
根據這段文字，以下關於總理的說法中，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **C: He feels well and can work remotely.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Besides a fever and sore throat, I feel healthy, in good general condition and can continue working remotely.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He has no fever:** The text specifically mentions he *has* a fever.
* **B: He will stay home for weeks:** The text says he'll isolate ""for a few days,"" not weeks.
* **D: He has severe symptoms:** The text describes ""mild symptoms.""



"
根據這段文字，熱帶氣旋古努預計何時會持續減弱？,"The correct answer is **B: 當風速降至每小時約 83 公里時**.

The text explicitly states: ""風速約每小時 83 公里，且預期會持續減弱."" This means the weakening is *already* expected to continue from that point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 到達馬爾地夫之前** - The text doesn't mention anything about weakening *before* reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: 在達到巔峰期之前** - The text describes the weakening *after* it has already reached its peak (240 km/h).
*   **D: 在達到每小時 149 英里的風速之前** - The text describes the weakening *after* it has already reached 149 mph (240 km/h).



"
熱帶氣旋古努巔峰期的風速有多快？,"The correct answer is **A: 每小時 149 公里**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the highest sustained wind speed was 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).
* Option A accurately reflects the wind speed in kilometers per hour.
* Option C is a repetition of option A, which is also correct. However, since the prompt asks for the windspeed in kilometers per hour, option A is the most appropriate.
* Option B is incorrect as it gives the speed in miles per hour, while the question asks for it in kilometers per hour.
* Option D represents the *earlier* wind speed, not the peak."
以下何者並不被視為腰鞭毛藻的特徵？,"正確答案是 **C: 它是多細胞生物**。

根據文章，腰鞭毛藻是一種**單細胞**海洋微生物。 因此，它是多細胞生物的說法是錯誤的。

以下是其他選項正確的原因：

* **A: 它是一種藻類** - 文章明確指出腰鞭毛藻是一種藻類。
* **B: 它可以癱瘓人類的神經** - 文章表明腰鞭毛藻會產生神經毒素，癱瘓人類的神經。
* **D: 它是天然生成的** - 文章指出腰鞭毛藻是天然生成的。
"
以下何者是腰鞭毛藻無法做到的事情？,"正確答案是 **B: 處於任何條件皆能急速增加數量**。

理由如下：

* **原文指出：** 「自然因素可以交互作用產生理想的環境，讓這種藻類的數量急速增加。」這表示腰鞭毛藻的增長需要特定的環境條件，並非在任何條件下都能快速增加。
* **A: 癱瘓魚類的神經** - 原文明確表示腰鞭毛藻會產生神經毒素，癱瘓魚類的神經。
* **C: 影響水質** - 紅潮本身就是一種水質變化，而腰鞭毛藻濃度高時會導致紅潮，因此會影響水質。
* **D: 產生神經毒素** - 原文也明確說明腰鞭毛藻會產生神經毒素。

因此，只有選項 B 與原文的資訊相矛盾。腰鞭毛藻的增長並非在任何條件下都能發生，需要特定的自然環境因素。
"
根據這段文字，以下何者並非颶風費莉希亞所導致的？,"The correct answer is **D: 街道洪水泛濫 (Street flooding)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""迄今為止，還沒有災害或洪水的報導"" which translates to ""so far, there have been no reports of disaster or flooding"". 
*   Options A, B, and C are all explicitly mentioned as effects of Felicia's remnants:
    *   **A: 有益的降雨 (Beneficial rainfall)** - ""歐胡島的降水量經估量已來到 6.34 英寸，可說是「很有幫助」"" (""The rainfall on Oahu has been estimated at 6.34 inches, which is considered 'very helpful'."")
    *   **B: 伴隨著雷鳴的降雨 (Rain accompanied by thunder)** - ""有時降雨會伴隨著雷鳴"" (""Sometimes the rain was accompanied by thunder."")
    *   **C: 反覆打電 (Frequent lightning)** - ""與經常性的閃電"" (""and frequent lightning."")

Therefore, street flooding is the *only* option not mentioned or implied as an effect of the hurricane."
關於颶風費莉希亞的哪種說法有誤？,"The correct answer is **B: 在變成第四級颶風前，它原本被歸類為熱帶低氣壓**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Felicia *weakened* **to** a tropical depression (which is different from a low-pressure system) *from* a Category 4 hurricane. It did not start as a tropical depression and *then* become a Category 4. It went the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: 其產生的降雨使歐胡島受益** - The passage directly states the rainfall on Oahu was ""helpful.""
*   **C: 大部分島嶼都有降雨** - The passage states the remaining effects brought rain to ""most islands.""
*   **D: 部分降雨伴隨著閃電** - The passage states rain was ""sometimes accompanied by thunder and frequent lightning.""



"
哪一種說法正確表達了 2009 年匈牙利大獎賽後的結果？,"The correct answer is **C: 小畢奇賽後遭到解僱**.

The passage states: ""小畢奇在 2009 年匈牙利大獎賽後失去賽車手的身分"" which directly translates to ""小畢奇 lost his driver position after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" This means he was fired/let go.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 費爾南多·阿隆索捲入一場撞車事故 (Fernando Alonso was involved in a crash):** The text mentions Alonso being involved in an incident in 2008, not 2009.
*   **B: 小畢奇奪冠 (小畢奇 won the championship):** The text does not mention anything about 小畢奇 winning.
*   **D: 安全車發生撞車事故 (The safety car was involved in a crash):** The text states a crash *caused* the safety car to be deployed, not that the safety car itself crashed.



"
撞車事故發生於何時？,"The correct answer is **A: 阿隆索一停車就發生了**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""小畢奇在費爾南多·阿隆索短暫停車檢修不久後，就發生撞車事故"".  This directly translates to ""Sutil crashed soon after Fernando Alonso made a brief pit stop.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 其他汽車加油時** - While other cars *did* pit under the safety car, the crash happened *after* Alonso's pit stop, not during others' refueling.
* **C: 安全車出來之前** - The passage explicitly states the crash *led to* the safety car coming out.
* **D: 小畢奇進去加油後** - The passage doesn't mention Sutil pitting. It states he crashed *after* Alonso pitted.



"
根據這段文字，以下哪一項花費的時間比研究人員最初認為的要少？,"The correct answer is **A: 物種的形成 (Species formation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""儘管過去人們認為新物種的演化過程歷時更久，但...這個新物種在短短兩個世代內就演化出來了..."" This directly indicates that the time taken for species formation was *less* than previously believed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 關於物種的報告 (Reporting on species):** The passage doesn't mention anything about how long it takes to *report* on species. It focuses on the time it takes for species to *form*.
* **C: 不同物種之間的繁殖 (Reproduction between different species):** While the new species arose from hybridization (reproduction between two species), the question asks what took *less time than expected* – that's the entire formation process, not just the act of breeding.
* **D: 物種的演化 (Species evolution):** Although related to species formation, the passage specifically highlights the surprise of how *quickly a new species* (formation) occurred, not necessarily the broader process of evolution in general.



"
研究人員沒有報導以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **C: 新物種的名稱 (New species name)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 新物種形成的地方 (Location of new species formation)** - The passage explicitly states the new species is forming in the Galapagos Islands.
* **B: 演化歷時長短 (Length of evolution)** - The passage highlights the surprisingly short timeframe of *two generations* for this new species to evolve.
* **D: 涉及混種的鳥類 (Birds involved in hybridization)** - The passage specifically names both the Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the cactus finch (Geospiza fortes) as the species involved in the hybridization.

The passage *does not* provide a name for this new species. It only describes it as a hybrid of the two mentioned finches.
"
奔牛藝術節將在哪裡舉行？,"The correct answer is **B: 在布加勒斯特市 (In Bucharest)**.

The passage states: ""該城市將成為東南歐首座主辦奔牛藝術節城市"" (The city will be the first in Southeast Europe to host the Cows Parade festival). This clearly indicates Bucharest is the location.
"
關於奔牛藝術節的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 這是世界上最大的公共藝術活動 (This is the largest public art festival in the world)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""奔牛藝術節是世界上最盛大的公共藝術活動 (The Cows Parade is one of the largest public art events in the world).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say it *only* happens in creative cities, but that Bucharest is *becoming* a creative city to host it.
* **B:** The passage says Bucharest's city hall is hosting an *event* that *includes* the Cows Parade, not that they created the Cows Parade itself.
* **C:** The festival is being held *in* Southeast Europe (specifically Bucharest), not *throughout* the region. It also has a specific timeframe (June-August).



"
是什麼原因導致俄羅斯停飛伊爾-76 ？,"The correct answer is **B: 一起事故**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""事故發生後，俄羅斯短暫停飛了 Il-76."" (After the accident, Russia briefly grounded the Il-76.)  This directly links the grounding to an accident (specifically an engine falling off).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 內衛部隊 (Internal Troops):** The internal troops were *scheduled to fly* the plane, but didn't cause the grounding.
*   **C: 蘇聯軍隊 (Soviet Army):**  While the Il-76 has been important to the Soviet and Russian military, the Soviet Army didn't cause the grounding.
*   **D: 尚未完成的調查 (Unfinished investigation):** The investigation was *formed* because of the accident, but the grounding happened *after* the accident itself."
什麼是伊爾-76？,"The correct answer is **C: 一架飛機 (a plane)**.

The text states: ""伊爾-76 自 1970 年代起即為俄羅斯及蘇聯軍事重要的一部分，..."" and references an incident involving its engine. This clearly indicates Il-76 is a type of aircraft.
"
誰聘請了《辛普森家庭》的編劇團隊？,"The correct answer is **B: 西蒙 (Simon)**.

The passage states: ""1989 年，他與布魯克斯和格寧一起合作，協助創作出《辛普森家庭》，並負責為該劇雇用第一個編劇團隊。""  ""他"" refers to Simon.
"
根據弗路克所言，是誰給了她正向的留言與鼓勵？,"The correct answer is **D: 男性和女性皆有** (Both men and women).

The passage explicitly states that Fluke received positive messages and encouragement from ""many women and men.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 醫生** (Doctors) - The passage doesn't mention doctors specifically.
*   **B: 婦女健康社會運動家** (Women's health activists) - While some may have been activists, the passage states it was a broader group.
*   **C: 男性** (Men) - The passage states both men *and* women provided encouragement."
根據這段文字，為什麼有人不想讓女性公開發表意見？,"The correct answer is **C: 婦女健康 (Women's Health)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states people are trying to ""cover up actions advocating for women's health.""** This directly implies there's resistance to openly discussing or supporting women's health issues. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 男性個別人士 (Individual men):** While the passage mentions support *from* men, it doesn't say men are actively trying to suppress the conversation.
* **B: 醫療費用 (Medical costs):**  The passage mentions contraceptives being considered a medical *necessity*, but doesn't say cost is the reason for wanting to silence discussion.
* **D: 意外 (Accidents):** Accidents (like unintended pregnancies) are a *result* potentially linked to women's health access, but not the reason someone would try to suppress the discussion itself.



"
根據這段文字，哪個天體最有活力？,"The correct answer is **A: Earth**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...only one celestial body is more active than Titan, and that’s Earth."" Therefore, Earth is identified as the most active celestial body."
在哪個天體上發現了由透明液體組成的河流和湖泊？,"The correct answer is **B: 泰坦星 (Titan)**.

The passage explicitly states that the liquid with water-like properties is found on Titan: ""它的特性就跟水一樣...因此，若你站在岸邊，你將能往下看到底部的鵝卵石或泥濘等東西."" This refers to rivers and lakes on Titan.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 木星 (Jupiter)** - Jupiter is a gas giant, not known for liquid rivers or lakes on its surface.
* **C: 太陽 (Sun)** - The Sun is a star, made of plasma, not liquid.
* **D: 土星 (Saturn)** - While Saturn is Titan's host planet, the passage specifically discusses the liquid being *on* Titan, not Saturn itself.



"
在這些發現中，何者並非發現羽毛的結果？,"The correct answer is **D: 確認大多數恐龍都有羽毛**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...this proves a widely held theory that *at least some* dinosaurs had feathers..."" This means the discovery confirms feathers in *some* dinosaurs, not *most*.
*   **The passage explicitly states:**
    *   **A: 動物羽毛的顏色:** ""The outer layer of this animal’s feathers was chestnut brown, while the inner layer was a faded white or carrot colour.""
    *   **B: 瞭解羽毛並不用來飛行:** ""These feathers’ structure suggests they were for thermoregulation or display, not flight.""
    *   **C: 對羽毛的演變有深入的見解:** ""The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of bird feathers.""

Therefore, only option D isn't a direct finding from the feather discovery described in the passage."
恐龍的羽毛不具備什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽軸 (Feathershaft)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""恐龍的羽毛缺乏發展健全的軸，所謂羽軸 (The dinosaur's feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, the rachis).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 小羽枝 (Barbs):** The passage states the dinosaur feathers *did* have barbs and barbules (羽枝與羽小枝).
*   **C: 成熟羽毛 (Mature Feathers):** The passage explicitly says the feathers were mature, not juvenile down.
*   **D: 顏色泛白的內層 (Whitish-colored inner layer):** The passage describes the feathers as having a whitish or carrot-colored inner layer.

Therefore, the only feature the dinosaur feathers lacked, according to the passage, is a fully developed rachis (羽軸)."
以下關於 ZMapp 的敘述中，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: It can treat existing infections, but cannot prevent death.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states ZMapp *didn't* meet expectations for preventing death.** It was hoped to be effective, but studies showed it didn't significantly reduce mortality. It doesn't say it *can* treat infections. The passage simply says it was an early hope, now shown to be less effective than initially thought.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **A: It is made of antibodies:** The passage specifically calls ZMapp an ""antibody cocktail.""
* **C: It served as a control group in the PALM trial:** The passage states ZMapp was used as a baseline for comparison in the PALM trial.
* **D: Studies showed its effects were less than expected:** The passage explicitly says ""its effects were not as dramatic as hoped.""



"
關於 PALM 試驗的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: ZMapp 被用作為試驗基準 (ZMapp was used as a trial standard)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ZMapp…was used as the control group, representing the benchmark against which the other three treatments were compared."" This means it served as the standard for comparison in the PALM trial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 研究表明，它的效果可能比預期的要好 (Research shows its effect may be better than expected):** The passage states the opposite - its effects didn't meet expectations.
* **B: 將管制藥品與其他三種治療方法進行了對照，其中一種是 ZMapp (A placebo was used in comparison with three other treatments, one of which was ZMapp):** The passage doesn't mention a placebo. ZMapp *was* one of the treatments being *compared* to.
* **D: 試驗證明它可有效治療現有病況 (The trial proved it could effectively treat existing conditions):** The passage says the trial showed it *didn't* meet expectations in preventing death.



"
研究人員認為新芯片對哪裡的意義最大？,"The correct answer is **A: 低收入國家 (Low-income countries)**.

The passage explicitly states the researchers believe this invention ""could allow early diagnosis of conditions like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV and malaria in low-income countries."" It even highlights the disparity in survival rates for diseases like breast cancer between these countries and wealthier ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 較富裕國家 (Wealthier countries):** The passage focuses on the *benefit* to countries that currently have lower survival rates.
* **C: 美國 (United States):**  While the research came from Stanford (in the US), the primary focus is on global impact, not just the US.
* **D: 史丹佛大學 (Stanford University):** Stanford is where the research was conducted, but the impact is intended to be much broader.



"
診斷工具將會透過何種方式製作？,"The correct answer is **B: 標準噴墨印表機 (Standard ink-jet printer)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這是一種細小的可列印芯片，使用標準噴墨印表機就能印出..."" (This is a small printable chip that can be printed using a standard ink-jet printer...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 每個成本一美分 (Each cost one dollar):** This states the *cost* of the chip, not *how* it's made.
*   **C: 可列印芯片 (Printable chip):** This describes *what* the tool is, not the method of production.
*   **D: 其他診斷工具 (Other diagnostic tools):** The question is about this *specific* tool, not others."
根據這段文字，關於瓣狀陡坡的說法，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 在月球表面發現的陡坡並不多 (There aren't many slopes found on the lunar surface)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states: ""月球上到處都是這種陡坡 (These slopes are everywhere on the moon).""** This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **A: 創造陡坡的事件可能最近才發生 (The events creating the slopes may have happened recently):** The passage says the slopes are ""風化程度很小 (little weathered),"" suggesting they formed ""不久之前 (not long ago).""
* **B: 它們的存在表示月球並不缺乏地質活動 (Their existence indicates the moon isn't lacking geological activity):** The passage states the theory ""與月球完全沒有地質活動的說法相違悖 (contradicts the claim that the moon has no geological activity).""
* **C: 它們可能是月球縮小所導致的結果 (They may be a result of the moon shrinking):** The passage explicitly states they are ""顯然是因為月球正極緩慢縮小而形成 (apparently formed because the moon is slowly shrinking).""



"
根據這段文字，關於地形的何種理論表明月球上發生了地質活動？,"The correct answer is **D: 這些地形是最近才形成的**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""…wind erosion is minimal, suggesting the events creating the slopes occurred relatively recently."" This directly supports the idea that the landforms are new in geological terms.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: 月亮正在慢慢縮小 (The moon is slowly shrinking):** While the passage *mentions* the moon shrinking as the *cause* of the slopes, it's not the theory about landforms that implies geological activity.
    * **B: 地形是很久以前形成的 (The landforms formed a long time ago):** The passage explicitly contradicts this, stating minimal erosion indicates recent formation.
    * **C: 月球表面僅具有極少量的地形 (The moon's surface has only a small amount of landforms):** The passage says the slopes are ""all over the moon,"" not limited in quantity.

The question asks which theory about the landforms themselves points to geological activity. The passage demonstrates that the *recent* formation of these slopes proves the moon *has* experienced geological activity, challenging the idea it's geologically inactive."
根據這段文字，起訴之前將不會再有什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 進一步的評論 (Further comment)**.

The text specifically states: ""負責整體檢察事宜的蘇格蘭皇家檢察院向記者表示，至少在起訴前，將不再做出任何評論。"" (The Scottish Crown Office, responsible for all prosecutions, told reporters it would make no further comment, at least until the indictment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 發布照片 (Publishing photos)** - The text discusses concerns *about* photos already published, and implicitly suggests further publishing is problematic, but doesn't state a direct ban from the Crown Office.
* **C: 討論目擊者的證詞 (Discussion of witness testimony)** - The text notes a *risk* of witness testimony being tainted, but doesn't say discussion is prohibited.
* **D: 發布文章 (Publishing articles)** - The text doesn't mention a ban on articles generally, only on comment from the Crown Office.



"
根據這段文字，何者並非海豹目前的問題？,"The correct answer is **D: 融冰 (Melting ice)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the problem is *breaking* ice and the *amount* and *thickness* of ice.** This hinders rescue efforts and is the worst it's been in 15 years according to Pitman.
* **The passage specifically mentions extreme weather conditions as a problem.**
* **Melting ice isn't mentioned as a current problem.**  While climate change and melting ice are the broader context of ice conditions, the immediate issue described is the ice *breaking* and its excessive *amount* and *thickness*.

Therefore, melting ice is the only option *not* presented as a current issue in the text.
"
除了冰，還有什麼因素影響救援工作？,"The correct answer is **B: 天氣狀況 (Weather conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""極端天氣狀況除了會導致冰層破碎，也阻礙了救援工作。"" (Extreme weather conditions not only cause ice to break apart, but also hinder rescue efforts.)

The other options are not mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: 缺乏補給 (Lack of supplies)** - Not mentioned.
*   **C: 缺乏援助 (Lack of assistance)** - Not mentioned.
*   **D: 海豹 (Seals)** - While seals are mentioned in the context of the hunters, they don't affect the rescue work."
羅伯茲迴避驗證哪個信念？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命起始點**.

The passage explicitly states that Roberts ""refused to specify when he believed life begins,"" which means he avoided validating that belief. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 討論案例的道德性** - He *did* address this, stating it was unethical to comment on specific cases.
* **B: 最高法院一致裁決的重要性** - He *emphasized* the importance of unanimous Supreme Court rulings.
* **D: 隱私權** - He *confirmed* his belief in the implied right to privacy.



"
羅伯茲覺得哪個話題太不道德而無法討論？,"The correct answer is **D: 特定可能的具體情況 (specific possible hypotheticals)**.

The passage explicitly states Roberts said it would be ""immoral to comment on specific possible hypotheticals"". He refused to discuss where he believes life begins, which falls under that category.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 最高法院裁決的一致性 (the consistency of the Supreme Court's rulings):** He *emphasized* the importance of consistent rulings, he didn't avoid discussing it.
*   **B: 羅訴韋德案的裁決 (the ruling in Roe v. Wade):** He reaffirmed his prior statements about Roe v. Wade being ""settled law"".
*   **C: 隱含隱私權 (implicit right to privacy):** He affirmed his belief in the implicit right to privacy upon which Roe v. Wade relied.



"
兩道光束照向何處？,"The correct answer is **A: 照向天際 (toward the sky)**.

The passage specifically states: ""整個晚上，兩道光束直直照向天際 (Throughout the night, two beams shone straight toward the sky).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 整座城市 (the whole city):** The passage doesn't say the beams illuminated the entire city.
* **C: 第一架噴射機的目標 (the target of the first jet):** The beams were shining *after* the impact, not *at* the target.
* **D: 紀念公園的中間 (the middle of the memorial park):** The passage mentions a memorial park, but doesn't say the beams were directed at it.



"
根據這段文字，該地點於何時建造新的摩天大樓？,"The correct answer is **D: 正在興建中 (Currently under construction)**.

The text states: ""Currently, five new skyscrapers are being built on the site, with a transit hub and memorial park in between."" This directly answers the question about when the skyscrapers are being built – *currently*, meaning they are *under construction*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 中午 (Noon):** The text doesn't mention any building activity happening at noon.
* **B: 8:46 A.M.:** This is the time of the initial impact, not when construction began.
* **C: 前一天晚上 (The previous night):** The lights shining all night are a separate detail and don't relate to the construction timeline.
"
哪些資訊表明七姐妹是洞穴？,"The correct answer is **A: 溫差 (Temperature difference)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""紅外線影像顯示其日夜溫差，顯現這些地方可能是洞穴"" (Infrared images show their day-night temperature differences, suggesting these places may be caves).  It then elaborates on *how* the temperature differences are cave-like (cooler during the day, warmer at night, and fluctuating like underground caves).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 洞穴入口的直徑 (Diameter of the cave entrances)** - While the size is mentioned, it doesn't *indicate* they are caves; it just describes a characteristic of the openings.  Many things can be large openings.
* **C: 地理調查 (Geological Survey)** - The USGS is *investigating* them, but the survey itself isn't evidence of them being caves. It's who is doing the research.
* **D: 地球上洞穴的影像 (Images of caves on Earth)** - The passage uses Earth caves as a *comparison* to explain the thermal behavior, not as evidence that these are caves themselves.



"
如何觀察七姐妹的熱行為？,"The correct answer is **A: 紅外線影像 (Infrared imagery)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**紅外線影像顯示其日夜溫差，顯現這些地方可能是洞穴**"" (Infrared imagery shows their day-night temperature differences, revealing these places might be caves). This directly answers how the thermal behavior of the ""Seven Sisters"" was observed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 地上的深洞 (Deep holes on the surface):** The passage doesn't mention any physical holes being dug.
*   **C: 洞穴的直徑 (The diameter of the caves):** Diameter is a measurement, not a method of observing thermal behavior.
*   **D: 地球上洞穴的調查 (Investigation of caves on Earth):** While the passage *compares* the thermal behavior to Earth caves, it doesn't state that studying Earth caves *is how* the behavior was observed.



"
根據這段文字，關於嫌犯的哪一種說法為非？,"The correct answer is **D: He was not injured.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""the man suspected of detonating the bomb was detained *after being injured* in the blast.""  This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: He used a vehicle in the attack:** The passage states, ""a man drove a three-wheeled motorcycle fitted with explosives into a crowd.""
*   **B: He is alleged to have detonated a bomb:** The passage states, ""The man suspected of detonating the bomb...""
*   **C: Authorities know his ethnicity:** The passage states, ""...they know he is a member of the Uyghur ethnic group.""



"
有關這次攻擊，當局確認了哪些資訊？,"The correct answer is **B: 嫌犯的種族 (The suspect's ethnicity)**.

The passage states: ""...they know he is a member of the Uyghur community."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 任何共犯的身份 (The identity of any accomplices)** - The passage doesn't mention any accomplices.
*   **C: 攻擊的動機 (The motive for the attack)** - The passage states authorities *don't* know the motive (""有關當局還不知道他的名字，但他們知道他是維吾爾族的一份子。"")
*   **D: 嫌犯的名字與姓氏 (The suspect's name and surname)** - The passage explicitly says authorities *don't* know the suspect's name (""有關當局還不知道他的名字..."")



"
哪些球隊將在艾利斯公園參賽？,"The correct answer is **C: 南非和澳洲**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The final match of the series will be next week when the Springboks play Australia in Johannesburg’s Ellis Park.""  Springboks is the nickname for the South African national rugby team.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 全黑隊和澳洲** - The passage doesn't mention the All Blacks playing in the final match.
*   **B: 紐西蘭和南非** - The passage states South Africa is playing Australia in the final match.
*   **D: Springboks 隊和全黑隊** - The passage states the Springboks are playing Australia, not the All Blacks, in the final match."
Springboks 隊的下一場比賽將在哪裡進行？,"The correct answer is **C: 約翰尼斯堡**.

The passage states: ""The final match of the series will be next week when the Springboks play in Australia, **at Ellis Park in Johannesburg**."" 

Therefore, Springboks' next match is in Johannesburg."
在執行任務期間，太空站遇到了以下哪項問題？,"The correct answer is **C: 噴射口啟動 (Jet activation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""俄羅斯的地面控制中心啟動了噴射口，接著太空站就重新恢復了正常姿態."" (The Russian ground control center activated the jets, after which the space station returned to its normal attitude.) This directly identifies the jet activation as a problem that was *addressed* during the mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 與推進器維持適當距離 (Maintaining an appropriate distance from the thrusters)**: This was a *precaution* taken by the astronauts, not a problem.
* **B: 保留陀螺儀 (Retaining the gyroscopes)**: The passage states a gyroscope was *lost* previously, it wasn’t a problem during *this* mission, only a past issue.
* **D: 恢復正常姿態 (Returning to normal attitude)**: This was the *result* of fixing the problem, not the problem itself.



"
根據這段文字，太空站的任務目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 完成太空漫步 (Complete a spacewalk)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the station *maintained its attitude until the spacewalk was complete*. This indicates the spacewalk was a key objective, and the station's functionality was geared towards enabling it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 找到遺失的陀螺儀 (Find the lost gyroscope):** The text mentions a *lost* gyroscope as a problem, but the mission isn't about *finding* it.
* **B: 靠近調整推進器 (Get close to the adjustment thrusters):** The text specifically says the astronauts *maintained a safe distance* from the thrusters.
* **D: 啟動噴射口 (Activate the jets):** While the jets *were* activated, that was a corrective action, not the mission goal itself.  The Russian ground control initiated it to restore normal attitude after a problem.



"
關於本案的陳述中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: AOL 遭到起訴**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states AOL is the *plaintiff* (the one bringing the charges)**, not the defendant (the one being charged). The *defendant* is the ""suspect"" who was prosecuted.
*   **A: 本案起訴於 AOL 總部所在的州** - The passage explicitly states this is true: ""The suspect was prosecuted in Virginia because that is where the plaintiff, internet service giant AOL, is located.""
*   **B: 本案已定罪** - The passage states ""this is the first conviction under the law"" meaning a guilty verdict has been reached.
*   **C: 本案使用了有關垃圾郵件的法規** - The passage clarifies that the prosecution used a law enacted in 2003 to prevent unsolicited bulk emails (spam).

Therefore, only option D misrepresents the information provided in the passage."
關於本案的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 本案由 AOL 提起訴訟**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""提告者，也就是網路服務供應商龍頭 AOL 的所在地"" - This directly means AOL is the plaintiff (the one bringing the lawsuit).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL 被指控未經許可寄發郵件** - The passage says a *suspect* was prosecuted for sending unsolicited emails, not AOL.
* **B: 本案涉及兩家網路供應商龍頭** - Only AOL is mentioned as being involved.
* **C: 本案於 2003 年起訴** - The passage states the law was enacted in 2003, but the *case* is the first prosecution *under* that law, meaning it happened after 2003.



"
根據這段文字，維達爾三個賽季前開始在哪家俱樂部效力？,"The correct answer is **C: 巴塞隆納**.

The text states Vidal joined Barcelona three seasons ago. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 塞維利亞** - He *left* Sevilla to join Barcelona.
* **B: 加泰隆尼亞** - 加泰隆尼亞 is a region, not a club.
* **D: 首府** - ""首府"" (capital) refers to Barcelona as a city, not a club.



"
維達爾為巴塞隆納俱樂部踢了多少場比賽？,"The correct answer is **A: 49 場**.

The passage states: ""自從搬到加泰隆尼亞的首府後，比達爾已經為球隊踢了 49 場球賽。"" (Since moving to the capital of Catalonia, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.)
"
比賽的對手是哪一支隊伍？,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states ""他在預定週日與 **Bolonia** 的對戰之前..."" (He stayed at the team's hotel before the scheduled Sunday match against **Bolonia**...). 

Therefore, Bolonia is the opposing team.
"
為什麼 Jarque 住在飯店？,"The correct answer is **C: He has a game on Sunday**. 

Here's why:

The passage states Jarque ""stayed at the team's hotel in anticipation of Sunday's match against Bologna."" This directly explains *why* he was at the hotel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He has practice** - While he *did* practice earlier in the day, the passage doesn't say he stayed at the hotel *because* of practice.
*   **B: He has a pre-season meeting** - The passage mentions pre-season training, not a specific meeting.
*   **D: He is training with Bolonia** - He is playing *against* Bologna, not training with them.



"
為什麼雅加達地球物理局不發布警報？,"The correct answer is **D: 震規未達門檻 (The magnitude did not reach the threshold)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""因震規未達 6.5 級門檻，所以不會發布海嘯警報"" which translates to ""because the magnitude did not reach a 6.5 threshold, a tsunami warning will not be issued.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 沒有海嘯威脅 (No tsunami threat):** While true, this is a *result* of the magnitude, not the *reason* the warning wasn't issued.
* **B: 避免居民恐慌 (Avoid residents panicking):** The passage actually *shows* residents panicking despite no warning, so this isn't the reason for not issuing one.
* **C: 避免影響當地企業 (Avoid impacting local businesses):** The passage doesn't mention any consideration of businesses.



"
根據這段文字，地震造成什麼結果？,"The correct answer is **A: 當地人的恐慌 (Local panic)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""儘管那裡沒有海嘯的威脅，居民仍開始恐慌，並開始離開他們的公司和家。"" (Despite there being no tsunami threat, residents began to panic and started leaving their companies and homes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 海嘯威脅 (Tsunami threat):** The text specifically says there was *no* tsunami threat.
* **C: 發布警報 (Alert issued):** The text states *no* tsunami alert was issued.
* **D: 6.5 級震規 (6.5 magnitude threshold):** This is the *reason* no alert was issued, not a result *of* the earthquake itself.



"
下列何者推動了太陽和所有其他恆星的活動？,"The correct answer is **C: 自轉和光度 (Rotation and luminosity)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""系統中所有恆星的活動均受其光度、自轉所推動"" which translates to ""The activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity and rotation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 光度和電漿的流動 (Luminosity and plasma flow):** While plasma flow is *related* to the Ro number, the passage directly states activity is driven by luminosity and rotation.
* **B: 羅士比數、自轉和磁場逆轉 (Ro number, rotation, and magnetic field reversal):** The Ro number *correlates* with activity, and magnetic field reversal is a result of activity, but they aren't the driving forces.
* **D: 光度、羅士比數和自轉 (Luminosity, Ro number, and rotation):**  Again, the Ro number is a factor *related* to activity, not a direct driver of it.



"
如何判斷恆星的羅士比數？,"The correct answer is **A: 光度和自轉 (Luminosity and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""恆星的羅士比數跟電漿的流動有關，必須以光度和自轉來判斷."" (The Rossby number is related to plasma flow and must be judged by luminosity and rotation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 電漿的流動 (Plasma flow):** While the Rossby number *relates* to plasma flow, it's not *how* you determine the number itself.
* **C: 活躍水平 (Activity level):** The passage states the Rossby number *influences* activity, not the other way around.
* **D: 磁場逆轉量 (Magnetic field reversal amount):** The passage states a smaller Rossby number means *less* activity in magnetic field reversals. It doesn't define how to *find* the number.



"
有多少百分比的受訪者支持澳洲立即成為共和國？,"The question asks for the percentage of respondents who support Australia becoming a republic **immediately**. The text states: ""29% of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed Australia should never become a republic.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 29%**.
"
根據茱莉亞·吉拉德的說法，澳洲應何時成為共和國？,"The correct answer is **B: 英國女王伊莉莎白二世統治後**.

The passage states: ""看守總理茱莉亞‧吉拉德在 2010 年聯邦選舉的競選活動期間宣稱，她認為澳洲應該在伊莉莎白二世女王任期卸任時成為共和國。"" This directly answers the question.
"
哪個組織正在接受法律調查？,"The correct answer is **C: 計劃生育聯盟**.

The passage explicitly states that Congressman Cliff Stearns is investigating the Planned Parenthood Federation of America's spending and how it accounts for its expenses. This means **Planned Parenthood** is the organization under legal investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 眾議院能源及貿易委員會** - This committee is *conducting* the investigation, not *being* investigated.
*   **B: 蘇珊科曼乳癌基金會** - The foundation *responded* to the investigation by changing its funding policy, but isn't the target of the investigation itself.
*   **D: 監督和調查小組委員會** - This is a subcommittee *within* the committee doing the investigating; it's not being investigated.



"
克里夫·斯特恩斯是哪個委員會的負責人？,"The correct answer is **D: 監督和調查小組委員會**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""身為美國眾議院能源及貿易委員會的**監督和調查小組委員會**的主席，司坦斯正在調查..."" 

While he *is* part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee (A), the text specifically identifies him as the chair of the *Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee*."
根據這段文字，在瑞士女人身上沒有發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: She had her stolen items recovered.**

Here's why:

* **The text states the police recovered her laptop and phone.** This directly indicates her stolen items were retrieved.
* **The text explicitly states the five arrested are suspects in a *rape* case**, but doesn't confirm if the rape actually occurred. While suspects have been apprehended, the outcome of the case isn't mentioned.
* **The text does *not* mention she was killed.**
* **While the text mentions her phone and laptop were stolen (D), the question asks what *didn't* happen to her, and having them recovered is a positive event, not something bad that happened to her.**

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that her stolen possessions were recovered.



"
哪家公司於 2007 年獲頒臺灣永續獎？,"The correct answer is **C: 華碩 (ASUS)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""但在華碩獲得中華民國行政院所頒發的 2007 年台灣永續獎之後..."" which translates to ""But after ASUS received the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award presented by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China...""

Therefore, ASUS was the company awarded the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007.
"
什麼是華碩 Eee PC？,"The correct answer is **B: 筆電 (Laptop)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""先前在全球推出的華碩 Eee PC 兼顧了精省與功能性等要素，這款電腦已成為 2007 年台北資訊月的熱門話題"" which translates to ""Previously launched globally, the ASUS Eee PC balances frugality and functionality, and this computer has become a hot topic at the 2007 Taipei Information Month.""  The word ""電腦"" means computer, and the context points to it being a type of laptop.
"
誰應對遺失的郵局文件負責？,"The correct answer is **C: 一名男孩 (A boy)**.

The passage explicitly states that the mail was found with a boy after residents complained about missing cards. He is the one who didn't deliver the mail.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 郵局工作人員 (Post office staff):** While the post office apologized, the issue was caused by the boy, not the staff themselves.
* **B: 一群花澤市居民 (A group of Odate City residents):** The residents *received* the bad news, but weren't responsible for the missing mail.
* **D: 媒體 (The media):** The media simply reported on the incident.



"
根據這段文字，誰為遺失的文件公開道歉？,"The correct answer is **D: 花澤市郵局 (Oishizawa City Post Office)**.

The text states: ""昨天，郵局已向市民與媒體公開道歉..."" (Yesterday, the post office publicly apologized to citizens and the media...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 當地居民 (Local residents):** They *complained* about the missing cards, but didn't apologize.
* **B: 男孩 (Boy):** He *caused* the problem by withholding the mail, but the post office apologized.
* **C: 媒體 (Media):** The media *received* the apology, they didn't give it.



"
德爾波特羅何時需要解決他的肩膀問題？,"The correct answer is **C: 第二盤期間 (During the second set)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""波特羅在此時接受了肩部治療，但仍設法回到比賽."" (Potro received shoulder treatment at this time, but managed to return to the match.) This clearly indicates the treatment (and thus the shoulder problem) occurred *during* the second set, specifically when the score was 6-6 and a tie-break was needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 第一盤期間 (During the first set)** - The passage states Murray lost the first set *after* all games were played, implying the shoulder issue wasn't present then.
*   **B: 第一次搶七前 (Before the first tie-break)** - The shoulder treatment occurred *after* the second set reached 6-6, which meant a tie-break was coming up.
*   **D: 第三次搶七後 (After the third tie-break)** - The passage only mentions one tie-break up to this point. Also, the passage mentions the treatment *before* Potro continued playing, not after a third tie-break."
第一次搶七的結果是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 莫瑞輸掉第一盤 (Murray lost the first set)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""莫瑞於搶七局中輸掉了第一盤 (Murray lost the first set in a tie-break)."" 

The other options are incorrect because:

*   B is false - the passage states Del Potro received treatment, but doesn't say he lost *because* of it.
*   C and D relate to the *second* set, which was still being played at the time the passage was written, and the result is not given."
如文中所述，是誰確定接觸過病患？,"The correct answer is **B: 兒童 (Children)**.

The text states: ""今天，我們得知有些學齡兒童確定曾與病患接觸。"" (Today, we learned that some school-aged children have been confirmed to have been in contact with the patient.) 

Therefore, the children are the ones confirmed to have had contact with the patient.
"
根據這段文字，州長對德州居民講話時沒有做出什麼保證？,"The correct answer is **D: 案例並不嚴重**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""這個案子非常嚴重 (This case is very serious).""
* The governor did *not* assure residents the case was *not* serious; he explicitly stated the opposite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 系統運作良好 (The system is working well):** He said, ""可以放心的是，我們的系統運作一如它應有的水準 (Rest assured, our system is working as it should).""
* **B: 已採取措施保護公眾安全 (Measures have been taken to protect public safety):** He ""向德州居民保證已採取措施保護公眾安全 (assured Texas residents that measures have been taken to protect public safety).""
* **C: 他們準備周全，足以面對挑戰 (They are well prepared to face the challenge):** He stated, ""全世界幾乎找不到其他地方比我們準備更周全，足以面對這個案例帶來的挑戰 (Almost nowhere in the world is as well prepared to meet the challenges this case presents as we are).""



"
哪個模仿新聞來源是由兩名前華盛頓大學學生建立的？,"The correct answer is **D: 《洋蔥報》**.

The passage explicitly states: ""早在《每日秀》和《科拜爾報告》之前，1988 年赫克和詹森還是華盛頓大學的學生時，便已設想出一種以諷刺滑稽的方式模仿新聞和新聞報導的刊物。自成立以來，洋蔥報已經成為一個名符其實的惡搞新聞王國...""

Therefore, 《洋蔥報》 is the source founded by the two former University of Washington students.



"
根據這段文字，《洋蔥報》的新聞模仿帝國不包括其中哪一個？,"The correct answer is **B: 一部電影 (A movie)**.

Here's why:

The passage lists the following as part of The Onion's empire:

*   印刷版新聞 (Print newspaper)
*   一個網站 (Website - attracting 5 million unique readers in October alone)
*   個人廣告 (Personal ads)
*   24 小時新聞網 (24-hour news channel)
*   Podcast
*   世界地圖集 (World atlas - ""Our Dumb World"")

A movie is **not** mentioned in the text. Therefore, it's the one thing The Onion's news empire does *not* include."
根據這段文字，警察在駐守什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 唐寧街入口**.

The text specifically states: ""...地點在白廳街，正對著有警察駐守的唐寧街首相官邸入口."" ( ""...located on Whitehall, opposite the entrance to Downing Street, which was guarded by police."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 特拉法加廣場** - The protesters *moved through* Trafalgar Square, but the police weren't guarding it.
* **B: 春季座談會** - The protest was *heading towards* the spring conference, but the police weren't guarding the conference itself.
* **D: 格蘭康納特飯店** -  Similar to B, the conference was held *at* the hotel, but the police weren't guarding the hotel.



"
警方何時要求抗議者移動，以避免交通更加堵塞？,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20**.

The text states: ""警察在 11 點 20 分要求抗議者退回到人行道..."" which directly answers the question.
"
關於埃胡德·烏爾醫師所做的研究何者為真？,"正確答案是 **B: 部分曾經罹患糖尿病老鼠現在沒有糖尿病**。

理由：

*   **文章中明確指出：「我們有 4 個月大曾經罹患糖尿病老鼠現在沒有糖尿病了」**。這是文章中直接給出的訊息。

讓我們看看為什麼其他選項不正確：

*   **A: 結果可能對已患有第一型糖尿病患者有益** - 文章明確說明烏爾醫師認為這些發現與已經患有第一型糖尿病的人無關。
*   **C: 他樂觀地認為這些發現可找到治癒方法** - 文章說烏爾醫師對糖尿病是否可以治癒存疑，因此他不樂觀。
*   **D: 部分不曾罹患糖尿病的老鼠現在患有糖尿病** - 文章中沒有提到過不曾罹患糖尿病的老鼠。"
根據這段文字，烏爾醫師對什麼存疑？,"The correct answer is **B: 是否可以治癒 (Whether diabetes can be cured)**.

The text states: ""...he (Dr. Ur) was skeptical whether diabetes could be cured...""  This directly indicates his doubt about the possibility of a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 研究結果是否與第一型糖尿病患者有關 (Whether the results are relevant to people with type 1 diabetes):** The text *explicitly* states he points out the findings are *not* relevant to those already with type 1 diabetes. He doesn't doubt the relevance, he confirms it's lacking.
* **C: 其他專家對治癒方法的看法 (Other experts’ views on a cure):** The text only mentions he shares the skepticism of *other* experts, not that he doubts their opinions themselves.
* **D: 不曾罹患糖尿病的老鼠可維持這種狀態 (Whether mice who never had diabetes can maintain this state):** The text focuses on mice that *had* diabetes and no longer do, not mice that never had it."
關於 CG4684 航班墜機事件的描述，以下說法何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 飛機在墜毀前已嘗試降落三次**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the plane *failed* once and was attempting a *second* landing when it disappeared. It doesn't mention a third attempt.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: 飛機原本因天氣因素而無法降落** - The passage explicitly states ""惡劣天氣"" (bad weather) was a factor in the initial failed landing and continues to hinder the search.
*   **B: 飛機墜毀在非常偏遠的地方** - The passage states the location is ""difficult to reach"" and requires officers to be ""parachuted into the jungle"" and then walk, indicating remoteness.
*   **D: 搜尋飛機墜機地點的行動受到天氣影響** - The passage directly says ""搜索行動同樣受到導致無法降落的惡劣天氣阻礙."" (The search is also hindered by the bad weather that caused the failed landing.)



"
是什麼導致 CG4684 班機降落失敗？,"The correct answer is **D: 天氣條件很惡劣 (Weather conditions were bad)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""搜索行動同樣受到導致無法降落的惡劣天氣阻礙"" (The search effort is also hampered by the bad weather that caused the failed landing). This directly links the failed landing to the poor weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 無法抵達降落位置 (Unable to reach the landing position):** While true as a *result* of the problem, it doesn't state *why* it couldn't reach the landing position.
*   **B: CG4684 前面還有其他幾架班機 (There were other flights ahead of CG4684):** The passage doesn't mention other flights.
*   **C: 飛機改道至科科達 (The plane was diverted to Kokoda):** The plane was *attempting* to land in Kokoda, not diverted there. It crashed before landing.



"
根據這段文字，關於弗朗西斯克·科瓦爾經歷的敘述中，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: He ultimately went unharmed**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""I was lucky enough to escape unscathed..."" (""我很幸運地毫髮無傷…"") which means he was unharmed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He managed to break a window:** The text says *others* were trying to break the window, and *finally* one broke. He wasn't the one who broke it.
*   **C: He broke a chair while trying to get out:** The text states *people* were using chairs to break the window, but it doesn’t say Kowal broke a chair.
*   **D: He was injured while trying to break the window:** The text explicitly says he was *unharmed*.



"
為什麼很難說得準熱帶風暴丹妮爾可能產生的影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 風暴還要很久才會登陸** (The storm is still a long way from making landfall).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""預計暴風雨還要很久才會登陸，會對美國或加勒比海地區造成多大的影響還很難說"" which directly translates to ""It is difficult to say how much impact the storm will have on the United States or the Caribbean region because the storm is still a long way from making landfall.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 預計風暴將增強為颶風** (The storm is expected to strengthen into a hurricane) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* it's hard to predict the impact. Strengthening is a factor in impact, but not the reason for the uncertainty stated.
*   **B: 科學家們無法確定風暴的持續風速** (Scientists cannot determine the storm's sustained wind speed) - The passage *does* state the current wind speed, so this is incorrect.
*   **D: 風暴距離邁阿密還很遠** (The storm is still far from Miami) - Distance alone doesn't mean impact is uncertain. It's the *lack of an imminent landfall* that causes the uncertainty.



"
根據這段文字，以下關於熱帶風暴丹妮爾的說法中，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: It is about to make landfall.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""It is too early to tell how much of an impact the storm will have on the United States or the Caribbean... and the storm is not expected to make landfall anytime soon."" 

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: It's impact on the Caribbean is still unknown** - The passage explicitly says this: ""how much of an impact the storm will have on... the Caribbean is still hard to say.""
* **B: It formed in the Atlantic** - The passage begins by stating it ""formed in the eastern Atlantic.""
* **C: It may become a hurricane** - The passage states scientists ""predict Tropical Storm Daniel will strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday.""



"
根據這段文字，在引起全球大流行之前，疾病必須先發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 必須變得不那麼致命 (must become less lethal)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He pointed out that some studies believe the disease must first become less lethal before it could cause a global pandemic."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 症狀必須保持輕微 (Symptoms must remain mild):** While the passage mentions mild symptoms are concerning *because* they allow continued spread, it doesn't say mild symptoms are a *requirement* for a pandemic.
* **C: 必須傳染給更多的人 (Must infect more people):** The passage states people are already potentially spreading it through daily life, so this isn't a precondition.
* **D: 兒童必須出現症狀 (Children must show symptoms):** The passage specifically discusses *asymptomatic* (no symptoms) infection in children, making this incorrect.



"
根據這段文字，當時颱風離福建有多遠？,"The correct answer is **C: 70 公里**.

The text explicitly states: ""莫拉克颱風的颱風眼距離中國福建省約有七十公里。"" (Morak typhoon's eye was approximately 70 kilometers from China's Fujian province).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 9 公里** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **B: 11 公里** - This is the *speed* the typhoon is moving, not the distance.
*   **D: 77 公里** - Not mentioned in the text."
喬治·W·布希抵達亞洲時，是誰迎接他？,"The correct answer is **C: 黃根成和李顯龍**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""由新加坡副總理黃根成迎接，並與新加坡總理李顯龍商談..."".  This means both Huang Kun Cheng (the Deputy Prime Minister) and Lee Hsien Loong (the Prime Minister) welcomed President Bush.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 總理 (Prime Minister)** - While Lee Hsien Loong *met* with Bush, he wasn't the sole greeter.
*   **B: 觀眾 (Audience)** - The audience listened to Bush's speech, they didn't greet him upon arrival.
*   **D: 副總理 (Deputy Prime Minister)** - Huang Kun Cheng greeted him, but Lee Hsien Loong also did.



"
總統何時談到亞洲擴大貿易一事？,"The correct answer is **C: 於中期選舉失利後**.

The passage states: ""期中選舉失利的一週後，布希告訴聽眾將於亞洲擴大貿易一事."" This directly links his announcement about expanding trade in Asia to the aftermath of the midterm election loss.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一抵達新加坡之際:** While he *did* mention it upon arriving, the passage specifies the timing was after the election.
*   **B: 與黃根生談話之際:** The passage only mentions discussing trade and terrorism *with* Lee Hsien Loong, not Huang Kun Seong.
*   **D: 於他為期一周的亞洲之旅期間:** This is too broad. While it happened *during* the trip, the key timing is specifically linked to the election result."
根據這段文字，總的來說，以下何者是政府的目標？,"The correct answer is **D: 紓解人潮過度擁擠的車廂 (Relieve overcrowding on trains)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the 1,300 vehicles (resulting from adding 300 carriages) ""can relieve overcrowding.""** This directly indicates the *purpose* of the purchase.
* While options A, B, and C are *actions* the government is taking, they are not the *overall goal*.  They are steps *towards* the goal of relieving overcrowding.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The announcement *continues* a promise made in March – it's not the goal itself.
* **B:** Buying 300 carriages is a part of the plan, but not the ultimate objective.
* **C:** The passage states 1,300 *vehicles* (after the addition), not that they are buying 1,300 *additional* vehicles.



"
政府公告了什麼事項？,"The correct answer is **A: They plan to allocate funds to purchase an additional 300 vehicles.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""today's announcement follows the government’s commitment...to allocate funds to purchase more carriages."" and ""adding 300 carriages to the existing 1,000 vehicles will alleviate overcrowding."" 
* This directly indicates the government's announcement is about funding the purchase of 300 *additional* vehicles (carriages).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: They are committed to resolving the vehicle problem.** While the purchase is *intended* to address a problem, the announcement is specifically about the funding for vehicles, not a general commitment to solve a ""vehicle problem.""
* **C: They plan to allocate funds to purchase an additional 1300 vehicles.** The passage states the total will be 1300 *after* adding 300, not that they're buying 1300.
* **D: The overcrowding problem will be resolved in March.** The passage mentions March as when the initial commitment was made, not as a resolution date."
根據這段文字，我們知道了什麼資訊？,"The correct answer is **A: 威脅程度已降低 (The threat level has been reduced)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states directly:** ""威脅程度降低至『嚴重』"" (The threat level has been reduced to ""Severe"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 不再有任何威脅 (There are no more threats)** - The text specifically says the threat *hasn't* disappeared, even though the level is lower.
* **C: 預計會發生攻擊 (An attack is expected)** - The text says there's ""無情報指出會發生立即性的攻擊"" (""no intelligence indicating an immediate attack""), so no attack is expected *immediately*.
* **D: 情報證實會發生很嚴重的攻擊 (Intelligence confirms a severe attack will happen)** -  The text indicates the *level* of threat is severe, but doesn't confirm an attack *will* happen.  It's a possibility, but not a certainty.



"
關於抗議活動，哪種說法為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 總統委員會是為回應抗議活動所設**.

Here's why:

*   The text states the CEP was established *in response to* the protests. However, it says the **Presidential Committee** suggested the previous CEP resign *as part of measures to move towards new elections*. The Presidential Committee wasn't formed *because* of the protests, it acted *in relation to* them to try and resolve the election issue.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: 逾期選舉引發了抗議活動** - The text directly states the protests started because of delayed elections (some due since 2011).
*   **C: 抗議活動要求前任臨時選舉委員會辭職** - The text says the Presidential Committee suggested the previous CEP resign *as part of moving towards new elections* which was a direct response to the protests.
*   **D: 抗議活動有時會使用暴力** - The text explicitly states the protests ""sometimes involved violence.""



"
誰建議前任臨時選舉委員會辭職？,"The correct answer is **C: 總統委員會** (Presidential Council).

The text states: ""總統委員會在上個月建議前任臨時選舉委員會辭職。"" (The Presidential Council last month recommended the previous temporary electoral council resign.)

Therefore, the Presidential Council is the one who made the recommendation."
根據聲明，在納薩爾虐待運動員之後，美國體操協會不支持什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 取消資格**.

Here's why:

The statement explicitly says: ""我們的選手、團隊和其運動項目的利益，會因為我們組織內具有意義的改革而改善，而非取消資格。"" (Our athletes, teams, and sport’s interests will be better served by meaningful reform within our organization, not by decertification.)

This directly states they do *not* support decertification (取消資格) as a response to the Nassar abuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 建立擁有自主權的環境** - The statement explicitly *supports* creating a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
*   **C: 組織內的必要調整** - The statement *supports* making necessary and appropriate adjustments.
*   **D: 獨立調查** - The statement explicitly *supports* an independent investigation.



"
根據聲明，美國體操協會和美國奧委會改善的主要目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 為運動員推動安全的環境 (To promote a safe environment for athletes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""美國體操協會為美國奧委會的來信背書，並認同奧林匹克大家庭絕對有需要為我們所有的運動員推動安全的環境。"" (The US Gymnastics Association endorses the US Olympic Committee's letter and agrees that the Olympic family absolutely needs to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.)
* **The passage also emphasizes:** making changes within the organization to improve things *for* the athletes and ensuring they can pursue their dreams in a safe and positive environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 揭露賴瑞·納薩爾的虐待行為 (Revealing Larry Nassar's abuse):** While the statement *mentions* the Nassar case and the need to understand why the abuse went undetected, the main goal isn't solely to reveal the abuse (it already has been revealed), but to *prevent* future abuse.
* **B: 實行取消資格 (Implement disqualification):** The passage specifically states they believe improvement comes from *reform*, not disqualification.
* **C: 實行私人調查 (Implement a private investigation):** They support an *independent* investigation, not a private one controlled by the organizations themselves.



"
事件發生時，船要前往哪裡？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 巴拉望**.

The passage states: ""該艦是復仇者級的反水雷艦，當時正前往巴拉望的普林塞薩港。"" (The ship was an Avenger-class minesweeper and was heading to Princessa Port in Palawan.)

"
關於文中提及的船，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: It is located in Palawan**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states the ship was *on its way to* Princessa Port in Palawan**, meaning it wasn't *in* Palawan yet. The ship was aground (stranded), but the text doesn't explicitly say *where* it's currently located, only its destination.
*   **A: It is on its way to Princessa Port** - This *is* stated in the text.
*   **C: It is a minesweeper** - ""Revenge-class anti-mine warfare ship"" confirms it's a minesweeper (反水雷艦).
*   **D: It is assigned to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet** - This is also explicitly stated in the passage.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that is *not* supported by the text."
是誰發表了關於美國軍隊的聲明？,"The correct answer is **A: 唐納·川普 (Donald Trump)**.

The passage states: ""星期日傍晚，美國總統唐納‧川普透過新聞秘書發表聲明，宣布美國軍隊將撤離敘利亞。"" (Sunday evening, US President Donald Trump issued a statement through his press secretary announcing the withdrawal of US troops from Syria.)

While the statement *was delivered* by the press secretary, it was *issued* by Trump. Therefore, Trump is the one who made the statement about the troops.
"
根據聲明，哪個國家承擔了保護受俘戰士的責任？,"The correct answer is **D: 土耳其 (Turkey)**.

The statement specifically says that Turkey will be responsible for guarding captured ISIS members. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 敘利亞 (Syria)** - The statement doesn't mention Syria taking responsibility.
*   **B: 歐洲 (Europe)** - The statement says European countries are *refusing* to take the members back, not taking responsibility for guarding them.
*   **C: 美國 (USA)** - The statement announces the US *withdrawal* and transfer of responsibility, not continued guardianship.



"
據信墜機的原因為何？,"The correct answer is **B: 敵軍開火 (Enemy fire)**.

The passage states: ""據信是敵軍攻擊所致"" which translates to ""believed to be caused by enemy attack."" 

While the passage *also* mentions bad weather and difficult terrain as hindering the search, it doesn't attribute the *cause* of the crash to them. It specifically states the crash is *believed* to be due to enemy fire.
"
墜機發生在何種類型的地形中？,"The correct answer is **D: 多山的 (Mountainous)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""This crash occurred in a **high mountainous area**..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 敵對的 (Hostile)** - While the passage suggests enemy action *caused* the crash, it doesn't describe the *terrain* as hostile.
* **B: 惡劣的 (Adverse/Severe)** - The weather is described as adverse, but not the terrain itself.
* **C: 聯合的 (Joint/United)** - This refers to the coalition forces, not the landscape.



"
政府希望洪水帶來什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 恢復沙洲 (Restore sandbars)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Resultantly, two fish species have gone extinct and another two, including the humpback chub, are endangered. Despite this, the government hopes the few feet of water released will be enough to **restore downstream sandbars** that have been eroding.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 創造海灘 (Create beaches):** While sandbars contribute to beaches, the passage specifically mentions restoring *sandbars* as the primary goal.
* **C: 增加座頭鯨的數量 (Increase the number of humpback whales):** The passage mentions the humpback *chub* (a fish), not whales.
* **D: 更多野生動物的棲息地 (More wildlife habitat):** While restoring sandbars *would* help wildlife habitat, the passage's direct statement is about restoring the sandbars themselves.



"
大壩的建設對以下何者產生永久的影響？,"The correct answer is **D: 沉積物擴散 (Sediment dispersal)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the dam ""stopped the seasonal floods that carried sediment down the entire river.""** This directly addresses sediment dispersal. The dam *permanently* altered this process.
* **A: 沙洲 (Sandbars)** - While sandbars *are* affected, they're a *result* of the altered sediment dispersal, not the primary permanent change *caused* by the dam.
* **B: 座頭鯨 (Whales)** - The passage does not mention whales at all.
* **C: 野生動物棲息地 (Wildlife habitat)** -  Habitat is affected, but again, the *cause* of the habitat loss is the lack of sediment, due to the altered dispersal.  Habitat is a consequence.

The question asks about the *permanent impact* of the dam. Stopping sediment dispersal is the direct and ongoing effect. The other options are outcomes of that primary change.
"
根據這段文字，是誰向美國提供了有關可能會發生攻擊的情報？,"The correct answer is **C: 保密的消息來源 (A confidential source)**.

Here's why:

The text states the US received information ""anonymously"". This means the source is confidential and not publicly known.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 索馬利亞的極端主義者 (Somali extremists)** - The text says the extremists *are planning* attacks, not that they *provided* the information.
*   **B: 衣索比亞大使館 (Ethiopian Embassy)** - The text doesn't mention any involvement from the Ethiopian Embassy.
*   **D: 肯亞的消息來源 (Kenyan source)** - The text doesn't mention a Kenyan source specifically; it just says the warning was issued *from* the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.



"
關於極端主義者聲稱的攻擊計劃，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 在兩個國家的地標引爆炸彈 (In landmarks of two countries)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the threat includes bombing ""landmarks"" in *both* Ethiopia and Kenya.  Therefore, the plan targets landmarks in two countries.

* **A** is incorrect because the threat is against two countries.
* **B** is incorrect because it doesn't specify *where* in the two countries the attacks will occur.
* **D** is incorrect because it's against two countries.



"
以下誰不是律師？,"The correct answer is **D: 麥基斯 (Makis Triantafylopoulos)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are ""known Greek lawyers.""
*   Petros Mantouvalos is described as a ""member of parliament *and* a lawyer.""
*   Makis Triantafylopoulos is identified as a **journalist** (""reporter"").

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one listed who is not a lawyer."
希臘法律界醜聞當中並未提及哪一群人？,"The correct answer is **A: 事務律師**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions:

*   **法官 (Judges):** Evanghelos Kraulis, the chief judge, was imprisoned.
*   **律師 (Lawyers):** Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos were convicted. Petros Mantouvalos (a member of parliament *and* a lawyer) resigned due to corruption involving his office staff.
*   **檢察官 (Prosecutors):** The passage states illegal acts by judges, lawyers, and prosecutors were exposed.
*   **記者 (Reporters):** Makis Triantafylopoulos is specifically named as a reporter who brought the information to light.

While the passage *mentions* ""事務律師 (administrative lawyers)"" as a group whose actions were revealed, it does **not** state that any specific administrative lawyer was implicated or faced consequences. Therefore, they are the group *not* specifically detailed in the scandal."
印度失去了幾個三柱門？,"The correct answer is **B: 7 個**.

The passage states: ""...但是，在失去隊長的三柱門後，印度只獲得 36 分和失去 **7 個三柱門**，球局便結束了。"" ( ""...However, after losing the captain's wicket, India scored only 36 runs and lost **7 wickets**, ending the innings."")
"
根據這段文字，這一局的最高得分是多少？,"The correct answer is **C: 100 分**.

Here's why:

The text states that Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid ""攜手合作之下得分來到了100分"" (worked together to reach a score of 100). While Robin Uthappa scored quickly, and the team ended on 36, the highest *score reached* during the innings was 100.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 70 分** - This is Robin Uthappa's runs, not the highest score of the innings.
*   **B: 36 分** - This is the final score when the innings ended, not the highest score *reached*.
*   **D: 41 分** - This is the number of balls Robin Uthappa faced, not a score."
以下何者非亞當·庫爾登不滿的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 該網站關於性內容的新政策**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the community is *drafting* a policy about sexual content.** This means the policy isn't the *cause* of Adam Kurly's frustration, but rather a *result* of the situation that's making him frustrated.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reasons for his dissatisfaction, based on the passage:

* **B: 威爾斯的作品被刪除 (Wales's work being deleted):** He specifically says ""until his work was deleted.""
* **C: 威爾斯未真心傾聽 (Wales didn't genuinely listen):** He states Wales ""pretended to listen to us.""
* **D: 對作品遭刪除的原因撒謊 (Lying about the reason for the deletions):** He claims Wales ""basically lied to us from the beginning,"" first with legal reasons, then by pretending to listen.

Therefore, the new policy is the outcome of the problem, not a reason for Kurly's complaint."
根據這段文字，什麼東西從網站上被刪除了？,"The correct answer is **A: 作品**.

Here's why:

The text states ""直到他的作品被刪除"" (""until his works were deleted""). This directly indicates that ""works"" were removed from the website.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 性內容** - The text says the community is *drafting* a policy about sexual content, it doesn't say it was deleted.
*   **C: 政策草案** - The policy is being *created*, not deleted.
*   **D: 自有媒體** - The text refers to ""millions of openly licensed media,"" not specifically ""owned media"" and doesn't state they were deleted.



"
根據這段文字，阿米爾·汗不支持以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 包括奧運會中的女鬥士 (including female fighters in the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""阿米爾·汗說：「我深深認為女性不該參與打鬥。」"" (Amir Khan said, ""I deeply believe that women should not participate in fighting."") This directly means he doesn't support women competing in combat sports like boxing, which would include the Olympics.
* **He *does* support British competitors:** The text says he *will* support British participants in the 2012 London Olympics, regardless of his views on female fighters.
* **The text doesn't mention women's opinions or London hosting the Olympics:**  The passage focuses solely on Amir Khan's position on women *participating* in fighting sports.

Therefore, the only option that aligns with Amir Khan's stated opposition is female fighters in the Olympics."
根據這段文字，儘管與阿米爾·汗個人想法相左，他仍會支持以下何者？,"The correct answer is **C: 2012 年奧運會 (2012 Olympic Games)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Despite making that comment, he said he **would support the British competitors at the 2012 London Olympics**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 女鬥士 (Female fighters)** - He specifically said he doesn't believe women *should* fight, so he wouldn't support female fighters.
*   **B: 2004 年奧運會的參賽者 (Competitors at the 2004 Olympics)** - The text doesn't mention his support for the 2004 Olympic competitors.
*   **D: 其他銀牌得主 (Other silver medalists)** - The text only discusses his opinion and support related to the Olympics, not other medalists.



"
彼得·倫茨何時死亡？,"The correct answer is **C: 在醫院**

Here's why:

The text states: ""...he later died at the hospital."" While the accident happened during the warm-up lap and he received immediate medical attention, he *died* at the hospital.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 於熱身圈期間** - This is when the accident happened, not when he died.
*   **B: 從摩托車上摔下來後** - This is also when the accident happened, not the time of death.
*   **D: 賽道現場上的醫護人員在身旁時** - They were providing care, but he died *after* being transported."
賽維爾·扎亞特是誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 另一位選手 (another racer)**.

The passage states: ""蘭茲在熱身圈時摔車，被同為選手的賽維爾‧札亞特撞上。"" This directly translates to ""Lanz crashed during the warm-up lap and was hit by fellow racer Saverio Zayat.""
"
在什麼情況下，瞭解飛機的內部運作可能能夠幫助到焦慮的飛機旅客？,"The correct answer is **B: If their aversion to flying centers on a fear of the unknown.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""認識飛機的運作原理以及飛行中發生的事，這可能有助於他們克服基於未知或不可控因素的恐懼.""  This directly links understanding how a plane works to overcoming fear rooted in not knowing what's happening.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: If passengers feel ashamed of their fear:** While the passage acknowledges fear isn't shameful, understanding the plane's mechanics doesn't address the *shame* itself, but the *fear*.
* **C: If passengers are hostile to all forms of transport:** This is too broad. The passage focuses on fear of *flying* specifically.
* **D: If their anxiety stems from trauma unrelated to flying:** While understanding the plane might be a distraction, the passage suggests it helps with fears based on the flight experience itself (unknown/uncontrollable factors), not unrelated trauma.



"
根據這段文字，一個注重價格的旅客最後會做以下哪件事？,"The correct answer is **D: 查看航空公司的網站 (Check the airline's website)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *after* comparing search results from various aggregator websites, it's worthwhile to ""check the airline's own website before ordering."" This implies a price-conscious traveler would ultimately **view the airline's website** to potentially find a better deal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 搜尋多家旅遊公司的產品 (Search products from multiple travel companies)** - The passage mentions searching aggregator sites, but the final step isn't just searching *more* companies.
*   **B: 直接向航空公司訂機票 (Book directly with the airline)** - The passage doesn't suggest booking directly initially, only *after* comparison.
*   **C: 比較多家旅遊公司之間的價格 (Compare prices between multiple travel companies)** - While price comparison is mentioned, it's not the *final* step according to the text. The final step is checking the airline's website *after* comparing aggregator sites.



"
根據這段文字，旅客首先應該做什麼才能確保最優惠的航班價格？,"The correct answer is **B: 比較不同資料彙集網站之間的價格**.

Here's why:

The passage states that prices can vary greatly *between* different aggregator websites. It then suggests checking the airline's website *after* comparing results. This implies the first step is the comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 查看航空公司的網站** - The passage says to check the airline's website *after* comparing aggregator sites, not first.
*   **C: 直接向航空公司訂機票** - The passage explicitly says people rarely do this without searching/comparing first.
*   **D: 直接向旅行社下單** - The passage doesn't mention travel agencies at all.



"
何時需要人員陪同送貨？,"The correct answer is **A: 透過空運寄送物品時**.

Here's why:

The passage states that air freight can take days to clear customs and unload on certain routes. This implies a need for someone to manage the process, or at least for the process to take a significant amount of time. The passage highlights the speed benefit of sending items *as checked baggage* specifically to avoid the delays of standard air freight. This also means that using the standard air freight method would require personnel to handle the unloading and customs clearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 公司使用自己的飛機時** - The passage doesn't suggest personnel are *required* when a company uses its own planes, just that larger companies *have* planes.
*   **C: 物品作為拖運行李寄送時** - The passage states this is a *way to avoid* needing personnel/speed up delivery, not when personnel are needed.
*   **D: 交付由大公司處理時** - The size of the company doesn't inherently dictate needing personnel to accompany the delivery. The method of delivery (air freight vs. baggage) is the key factor.



"
根據這段文字，在航空聯盟中選擇飛行常客航空公司時，你應該優先考慮以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 提供最多點數的航空公司**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""相同聯盟的不同航空公司給予的飛行常客點數可能會更多"" (different airlines within the same alliance may give more frequent flyer points). It advises against simply choosing the airline you fly most often, and instead suggests considering the benefits (specifically points) offered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 屬於最大航空聯盟的航空公司:** The passage doesn't mention the size of the alliance being important.
*   **C: 你最常搭乘旅行的航空公司:** The passage *specifically* advises against this as your sole consideration.
*   **D: 可能另外增加特別待遇的航空公司:** While perks are nice, the passage focuses on point accumulation as the key factor.



"
根據這段文字，哪家航空公司可能會給予更多的飛行常客點數？,"The correct answer is **D: 相同聯盟中的不同航空公司** (Different airlines within the same alliance).

Here's why:

The passage states ""...相同聯盟的不同航空公司給予的飛行常客點數可能會更多"" which directly translates to ""different airlines within the same alliance may give more frequent flyer points.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 不同聯盟中的不同航空公司** (Different airlines in different alliances) - The passage focuses on differences *within* an alliance, not *between* alliances.
*   **B: 相同聯盟中，您最常搭乘旅行的航空公司** (The airline you travel with most often within the same alliance) - The passage specifically cautions against automatically choosing the airline you fly most, suggesting others *within the same alliance* might be better.
*   **C: 不同聯盟中，您最常搭乘旅行的航空公司** (The airline you travel with most often in different alliances) - Again, the passage is about comparing airlines *within* the same alliance.



"
根據這段文字，以下哪些感官會因過量飲酒而受損？,"The correct answer is **B: 視覺 (Vision)**.

The text explicitly states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to **blindness** as a long-term health problem, and illegal alcohol can contain methanol which can also cause **blindness** even in small amounts. 

The text doesn't mention any impact on hearing, taste, or smell.
"
如文中所述，做什麼事可能可以減輕酒精的有害影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 適量飲酒 (Drink in moderation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""飲用酒精性飲料要適量 (Drinking alcoholic beverages should be in moderation)."" It then goes on to explain the dangers of *over*consumption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 飲用含有甲醇的酒 (Drink alcohol containing methanol):** The passage warns that methanol is *dangerous* and can cause blindness or death.
* **B: 飲用非法生產的烈酒 (Drink illegally produced liquor):** The passage warns that illegal liquor is dangerous due to potential contaminants.
* **D: 與不同的人一起飲酒 (Drink with different people):** The passage doesn't mention anything about who you drink *with*, only *how much* you drink.



"
阿姆斯特丹地產價值最高的地方在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **A: 運河區**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""...其地產價值屬國內最高"" (its property value is the highest in the country) and this refers to the ""運河區（荷蘭語：Grachtengordel）"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 聯合國教科文組織列為世界遺產的地方:** While the *運河區* *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, the question asks for the location with the highest property value, not just a UNESCO site.  Many places are UNESCO sites without being the most expensive.
* **C: 從內城移除的區域:** The passage states the 運河區 *surrounds* the inner city, not that it's removed from it.
* **D: 具有歷史價值的地點:**  Many places have historical value, but the passage specifically points to the 運河區 as having the highest property value.



"
為什麼聯合國教科文組織將運河區指定為世界遺產？,"The correct answer is **A: 它的歷史和文化價值 (Its historical and cultural value)**.

The passage explicitly states that the ""entire area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its unique cultural and historical value."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 它獨特的資產 (Its unique assets)** - While the area *has* unique assets, the passage specifically highlights *historical and cultural* value as the reason for the UNESCO designation.
* **C: 它位於內城周圍 (It is located around the inner city)** - Location is a descriptive fact, not the reason for being a World Heritage site.
* **D: 它的高地產價值 (Its high property value)** - High property value is a *result* of its value, not the reason for UNESCO recognition.



"
根據這段文字，下列豬山寺廟的哪一點值得一訪？,"The correct answer is **A: 洞里薩湖的景色 (The view of Tonle Sap Lake)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""神廟陰鬱的氣氛和洞里薩湖的美景，讓攀登到山頂的這段路程值回票價。"" (The temple's gloomy atmosphere and the beauty of Tonle Sap Lake make the climb worthwhile.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 穿越吳哥窟 (Crossing Angkor Wat)** - The text says you need an Angkor Wat pass to *enter* Phnom Bakheng, but doesn't say you cross Angkor Wat to get there.
* **C: 參觀暹粒市 (Visiting Siem Reap City)** - The text only mentions Phnom Bakheng is *southwest of* Siem Reap, not that visiting the city is a reason to visit the temple.
* **D: 乘船遊湖 (Taking a boat trip on the lake)** - The text says a visit *can be combined* with a boat trip, but the boat trip itself isn't highlighted as a reason to visit Phnom Bakheng.



"
根據這段文字，遊客需要什麼才能進入豬山寺廟？,"The correct answer is **C: 取得吳哥窟通行證** (Obtain an Angkor Pass).

The text specifically states: ""必須持吳哥窟通行證才能進入神廟，所以去洞里薩湖時別忘了帶吳哥窟門票。"" (You must have an Angkor Pass to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your Angkor ticket when you go to Tonle Sap Lake.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 登山行經耶輸跋摩神廟** (Climbing through the Yeasuvarman temple) - While the temple was built during Yeasuvarman's reign, the text doesn't say you *need* to climb through another temple.
* **B: 環遊暹粒市** (Touring Siem Reap) - The location of the temple is mentioned, but not that you need to tour the city.
* **D: 乘船遊洞里薩湖** (Take a boat tour of Tonle Sap Lake) -  A boat tour is *conveniently combined* with a visit, but not *required* for entry.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者能阻止遊客到訪南極洲？,"The correct answer is **A: 高昂的旅行預算**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""遊客來訪的花費頗高"" (visiting is quite expensive). This directly states cost is a barrier to visiting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 僅羅斯海值得探索** - The passage says tourism is limited to the peninsula, islands, and Ross Sea, *not* that only the Ross Sea is worth visiting.
* **C: 能夠在十二月和一月旅行的工作時程** - The passage states travel is *only* possible between November and February, so a work schedule allowing travel in December and January wouldn't *prevent* a visit.
* **D: 受限的身體行動力** - The passage mentions needing physical stamina (""需要體力""), suggesting limited mobility would be a hindrance, but it doesn't state it *prevents* visits. Cost is a more direct barrier mentioned.



"
對登山感興趣的遊客可能會參觀南極洲的哪個部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 內陸地區 (the interior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""專家偶爾會搭機進入南極州內陸登山，或前往位在南極點的大型基地。"" (Experts occasionally fly into the Antarctic interior to climb, or go to the large base at the South Pole.)

This directly links the interior of Antarctica to mountain climbing. The other options are mentioned as areas visitors *generally* go to, but not specifically for mountaineering.
"
前現代天文台最不可能位於何處？,"The correct answer is **C: 偏遠之地**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that *modern* research telescopes are located in remote areas due to atmospheric conditions. It also states that *pre-modern* observatories were typically located in cities or on campuses because light pollution wasn't a problem then and they were *more accessible*.  Therefore, a pre-modern observatory would be *least* likely to be found in a remote location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 交通便利的位置** - The passage states pre-modern observatories were easier to reach.
* **B: 市中心** - The passage states pre-modern observatories were often in cities.
* **D: 大學校園裡** - The passage states pre-modern observatories were often on campuses."
現代研究型望遠鏡可能安置在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **D: 大型設施**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""大大部分現代研究型望遠鏡都是巨大的設施，座落於有大氣條件良好的偏遠地區。"" (Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities, located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 博物館 (Museum):** The passage states *pre-modern* observatories are now museums.
* **B: 大學校園 (University campus):** The passage states pre-modern observatories were *often* located on campuses, but modern ones are not.
* **C: 教育場所 (Educational places):** Similar to B, this describes the *current* use of older observatories, not where modern ones are built.



"
根據這段文字，哪個區域最適合寧靜的海灘日？,"The correct answer is **C: 北港區**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the North Shore beaches (North Harbour) are ""almost all beaches where people can swim safely"" and ""mostly have shade provided by Pohutukawa trees (New Zealand Christmas trees).""** This implies a more relaxed, natural, and generally safer experience.
* The text describes Tamaki Drive beaches (in Waitemata Harbour) as ""often crowded family beaches with rows of shops.""  ""Crowded"" suggests it's *not* a quiet day.
* While Mission Bay is mentioned with Tamaki Drive, the description applies to the whole area - bustling and family-oriented.
* St Heliers is also described as a ""high-end suburb"" along Tamaki Drive, sharing the same characteristics of being busy and commercial.

Therefore, the North Harbour beaches are the most likely to offer a peaceful beach day."
根據這段文字，哪裡的游泳條件可能最為安全？,"The correct answer is **B: 北港區**. 

Here's why:

The text specifically states that beaches in the North Shore (North Harbour) ""are almost all beaches where it is safe to swim"". While other locations are mentioned as having safe swimming, the North Harbour area is presented as *generally* safe.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 德文港:** While Devonport is *within* the North Harbour area and has safe beaches, the question asks for the area itself.
*   **C: 奧克蘭中央區:** The text states the beaches in this area (Tamaki Drive) are safe, but doesn't imply overall safety like the North Harbour area.
*   **D: 長灣:** Long Bay is a specific beach *within* the North Harbour area. The passage refers to the entire North Harbour area as being mostly safe for swimming, not just Long Bay.



"
到訪文中所述的位置時，下列何者會被視為不合時宜的舉動？,"The correct answers are **B, C, and D**. Here's why:

* **B: 在遺址周圍的某處留下標記:** The passage explicitly states ""Please do not mark or deface the buildings."" Leaving any mark is disrespectful.
* **C: 開玩笑:** The passage explicitly states ""Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.""
* **D: 在建築物上塗鴉:** This is specifically forbidden in the passage: ""Do not mark or deface the buildings.""

* **A: 舉止莊重:** The passage *encourages* respectful and solemn behavior. This is the *opposite* of inappropriate.

Therefore, any action that lacks reverence or defaces the site would be inappropriate.



"
以下何者說明了通用語言？,"The correct answer is **D: 是有機的 (Is organic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that auxiliary languages are *artificial* or *constructed*.** It then *contrasts* them with common tongues (通用語).
* **The contrast implies that common tongues are *not* artificial.** Instead, they develop *naturally* through use over time.  ""Organic"" best captures this idea of natural development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 是人工的 (Is artificial):** This describes *auxiliary* languages, not common tongues.
* **B: 是不自然的 (Is unnatural):** While artificial languages can be considered unnatural, this isn't the defining characteristic of a common tongue.
* **C: 是建構而成的 (Is constructed):** This also describes *auxiliary* languages.
"
關於輔助語言的描述，以下說法何者不正確？,"正確答案是 **D: 它們是不同語言使用者之間所創造的具主導地位的語言**。

理由如下：

* **P 段落明確指出**輔助語言是*為了輔助*溝通障礙人士，而不是成為主導地位的語言。主導地位的語言通常指的是通用語 (Lingua Franca)，P 段落明確區分了兩者。

讓我們看看其他選項為何正確：

* **A: 它們是有機語言，用於輔助可能無法互相理解的人之間的溝通** - 正確，輔助語言的確是為了彌補溝通障礙而設計的。
* **B: 它們是自然且建構而成的語言** - 正確，""建構而成""是 P 段落中明確提到的。雖然不是自然產生的，但屬於語言。
* **C: 它們是為改善溝通困難的場景而建構的語言** - 正確，這直接呼應了 P 段落關於輔助溝通的定義。

因此，選項 D 是與 P 段落描述不一致的。
"
根據這段文字，如果乘客是搭乘冬季郵輪，他們應該檢查什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 簽證要求**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""船上乘客無須持有簽證 (檢查相關規定)."" - ""Passengers on the cruise do not need a visa (check the relevant regulations).""  This directly tells passengers to check visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 艙房位置 (Cabin location):** While the text *mentions* cabin location, it's about avoiding noise, not something passengers *should check* before the cruise. It's a concern *if* you are travelling in winter, not a pre-trip check.
* **C: 簽證規定 (Visa regulations):**  The text says to check ""relevant regulations,"" not just the regulations themselves. It's the *requirement* to check that's important.
* **D: 在城裡度過的時間 (Time spent in the city):** The text mentions a city tour, but doesn't indicate passengers need to check how long they'll be there.



"
根據這段文字，如果乘客是搭乘夏季郵輪，他們可能可以避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 穿過浮冰 (Passing through ice floes)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states the loud and frightening noises caused by ice floes during a **winter** crossing of the Baltic Sea.  A summer cruise would avoid the ice.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A: 在城裡的時間 (Time in the city)** - The text states that the St. Petersburg cruise *includes* city sightseeing.
    * **C: 簽證要求 (Visa requirements)** - The text says passengers don't *need* a visa, regardless of the season.
    * **D: 聖彼得堡 (St. Petersburg)** -  The destination is the same for both winter and summer cruises.



"
為什麼巴塞隆納的標誌和廣播經常使用加泰隆尼亞語？,"The correct answer is **B: 它是該市的第一官方語言**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""However, most signs are displayed in Catalan only because it is legally the first official language.""  This directly explains why Catalan is prioritized in signage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 懂它的人比懂西班牙文的人更多 (More people understand it than Spanish):** The text says ""about half the population *prefer* to speak Catalan"", and ""almost everyone understands Spanish."" It doesn't say more understand Catalan.
* **C: 它是巴塞隆納境內偏好的語言 (It is the preferred language within Barcelona):** While preference is mentioned, the *legal* reason is more important for official signage.
* **D: 經常光顧地鐵和其他公共設施者大多是講加泰隆尼亞語的市民 (Those who frequently use the subway and other public facilities are mostly Catalan speakers):** The text doesn't provide information about the language of public transport users.



"
巴塞隆納的地鐵系統使用以下哪種語言進行固定廣播？,"The correct answer is **B: 加泰隆尼亞語**.

The passage states: ""地鐵中的固定廣播只有加泰羅尼亞語"" (The fixed broadcasts in the metro are only in Catalan).
"
根據這段文字，高端市場中的寢具用品和早餐不太可能優先考慮以下哪些設施？,"The correct answer is **D: 快速的無線網路**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically highlights that high-end B&Bs compete on **bedding and breakfast** – luxurious linens and high-quality, often local/homemade breakfasts. It also mentions historical buildings with antique furniture and well-maintained gardens/pools. These all contribute to the *luxury experience* described.

* **A: 特製佳餚菜單 (Specialty menu)** - The text directly states breakfast might include the owner's special dishes.
* **B: 獨特的古董傢俱 (Unique antique furniture)** - The text mentions antique furniture as a feature of these places.
* **C: 維護良好的戶外空間 (Well-maintained outdoor space)** - The text mentions well-manicured gardens and pools.

However, **fast Wi-Fi** isn't mentioned at all. The passage focuses on traditional luxuries and experiences, not modern conveniences. It's reasonable to assume that while high-end B&Bs *might* offer Wi-Fi, it wouldn't be a primary competitive factor like the bedding and breakfast themselves, or the aesthetic and historical aspects of the property.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者不是豪華民宿之間的競爭要點之一？,"The correct answer is **A: 現代裝飾 (Modern decor)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the main competitive areas for high-end B&Bs are:

* **Bedding (high-end, handmade, antique)**
* **Breakfast (local, seasonal, or homemade)**
* **The property itself (historic building, antique furniture, gardens, pool)**

The passage *implies* a focus on classic elegance and history, not modern decor. The examples given lean towards antique and traditional styles.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: 各種季節性早餐 (Seasonal breakfast variety)** - Directly mentioned as a competitive factor.
* **C: 高檔寢具 (High-end bedding)** - Explicitly stated as a major competitive item.
* **D: 當地採購的食物和飲料 (Locally sourced food and drink)** - This falls under the ""local, seasonal"" breakfast described in the text.



"
根據這段文字，2022 年北京不會舉辦以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 太子城滑雪區活動**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that other ski events *will* be held at the Prince City ski area (太子城滑雪區) in Zhangjiakou, not that they *won't*. It says Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice events.  

Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the information given in the text.
"
根據這段文字，2022 年北京會舉辦以下何者？,"The correct answer is **C: 冬季奧運會 (Winter Olympics)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""中國的北京市將主辦 2022 年的冬季奧林匹克運動會 (Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics).""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 夏季奧運會 (Summer Olympics):** The text says Beijing will be the *first city to host both* summer and winter, implying they've hosted a summer Olympics before, but not in 2022.
*   **B: 在室內舉辦的冰上項目 (Indoor ice sports):** While the passage mentions indoor ice sports will be held in Beijing, it doesn't say *only* indoor ice sports will be held.
*   **D: 閉幕式 (Closing ceremony):** The passage states Beijing will host the closing ceremony *along with other events*, but the question asks what Beijing will *host* as a whole."
誰感染禽流感的風險最高？,"The correct answer is **C: 家禽飼養從業人員**.

The passage states: ""大部分的案例都是家禽飼養從業人員，但賞鳥者也會有一些風險。"" (Most cases are poultry farm workers, but birdwatchers are also at some risk.) 

Therefore, poultry farm workers are at the highest risk.
"
根據這段文字，關於禽流感的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 賞鳥者有被感染的風險 (Birdwatchers are at some risk of infection)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""大部分的案例都是家禽飼養從業人員，但賞鳥者也會有一些風險 (Most cases are among poultry workers, but birdwatchers are also at some risk).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 只有家禽飼養從業人員感染過 (Only poultry workers have been infected):**  The text specifically says birdwatchers *also* have some risk.
* **B: 已知在人類身上發生的案例多於鳥類 (More cases are known in humans than in birds):** The text states avian influenza infects both birds *and* mammals, but doesn't compare case numbers between the two.
* **D: 已知在人類身上發生的案例都是致命的 (All known human cases have been fatal):** The text says ""有些是致命的 (some are fatal)"", not all.



"
白海-波羅的海運河連接了什麼地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 北極海和波羅的海**.

The text explicitly states: ""白海-波羅的海運河經過奧涅加湖、拉多加湖和聖彼得堡，主要以河川和湖泊將北極海和波羅的海連在一起。"" (The White Sea-Baltic Canal passes through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, primarily connecting the Arctic Sea and the Baltic Sea with rivers and lakes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 黑海和裏海** - The text mentions Vikings traveling *to* the Black and Caspian Seas, but the White Sea-Baltic Canal doesn't connect them.
* **B: 奧涅加湖和窩瓦河** - While the text states Lake Onega is connected to the Volga River, this isn't the main purpose of the White Sea-Baltic Canal.
* **D: 南極海和紅海** - The text doesn't mention these bodies of water at all.



"
根據這段文字，為了避免打擾乘客，護照可能會在什麼類型的交通工具上被收走？,"The correct answer is **B: 夜間臥鋪火車**.

The text specifically states: ""搭乘夜間臥鋪火車時，列車長可能會將護照收走，這樣就不會打斷你的睡眠。"" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 飛機** - The text mentions入境檢查站 are usually the first stop *after* leaving a plane, but doesn't say passports are collected on planes.
* **C: 船舶** - The text mentions入境檢查站 are usually the first stop *after* leaving a ship, but doesn't say passports are collected on ships.
* **D: 跨境火車** - While the text says you should have ID on these trains, it doesn't mention passports being collected.



"
根據這段文字，在某些跨境火車上，何時可能會查驗你的身分證？,"The correct answer is **D: 火車行進時**.

The text specifically states: ""某些跨越邊境的火車會在行進時進行檢查，因此搭乘這種火車時，你應該攜帶有效的身分證明。"" (Some cross-border trains will be checked while in transit, so you should carry valid identification when riding these trains.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 下車後** - The text mentions immigration is usually the first stop *after* exiting transportation, not during a train ride.
*   **B: 睡覺時** - The text says the conductor might take your passport *during* sleep to avoid disturbance, not to check your ID.
*   **C: 不會查驗身分證** - The text clearly states some trains *do* check ID."
留在新加坡的高熱帶地區時，最有可能出現以下哪種問題？,"The correct answer is **C: 中暑 (Heatstroke)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states Singapore is in a ""high tropical region"" and you'll need to deal with ""high temperatures and scorching sunshine."" This directly relates to the risk of heatstroke (中暑).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 遭搶 (Being robbed):** The passage states Singapore is ""generally very safe.""
*   **B: 無法進入商店 (Unable to enter shops):** The passage says you can ""buy almost anything"" after entering, implying shops are accessible.
*   **D: 迷路 (Getting lost):** The passage mentions convenient transportation, suggesting it's easy to get around.



"
誰可能會不想吃德國糕點？,"The correct answer is **A: 對堅果嚴重過敏的人**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""許多德國的烘焙食品中常含有杏仁、榛果和其他木本堅果"" (Many German baked goods often contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts). Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 喜歡甜點更豐富的人** - The passage doesn't suggest German pastries are *not* rich. It just describes what they *are* like.
* **C: 不喜歡巧克力的人** - Chocolate isn't mentioned in the passage, so this isn't relevant.
* **D: 喜歡甜味而非鹹味的人** - The passage focuses on the ingredients and types of pastries, and doesn't indicate they are not sweet. The fact that they pair well with coffee suggests they have some sweetness.



"
哪種食材屬於德國糕點的季節性元素？,"The correct answer is **C: 李子 (Plums)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""櫻桃與李子則在夏日會出現在餐桌上"" (Cherries and plums appear on the table in summer). This clearly indicates plums are a seasonal element in German pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 蘋果 (Apples)** - Apples are made into pastries ""year-round"".
*   **B: 榛果 (Hazelnuts)** - Hazelnuts (and other nuts) are generally *in* many German baked goods, but not specifically tied to a season.
*   **D: 杏仁 (Almonds)** - Almonds are also generally *in* many German baked goods, not seasonal.



"
根據這段文字，針對預算有限的旅行而言，以下何者並非推薦方法？,"The correct answer is **C: 跟人要錢**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the recommendations *do not* include ""乞討"" (begging) or ""以別的方式剝削他人"" (exploiting others). Asking people for money falls directly into the category of begging.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: 在旅行期間尋找零工 (Working during your travels):** The text states that one way to travel cheaply is to work while traveling, although the article focuses on limiting expenses instead.
*   **B: 彈性調整您的舒適度 (Being flexible with your comfort):** The text says you need to ""犧牲舒適"" (sacrifice comfort) to lower costs.
*   **D: 減少食宿等開銷 (Reducing expenses like food and accommodation):** The text specifically mentions limiting expenses as a primary strategy for budget travel.



"
根據這段文字，誰可能很難以最低預算旅行？,"The correct answer is **D: 喜歡按照預定行程走的人**.

Here's why:

The text states that minimum budget travel requires sacrificing ""comfort, time, and predictability."" People who like to follow a set itinerary value predictability. They want to know what's happening when, and minimum budget travel inherently lacks that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 歡迎挑戰的人** - The text *encourages* those who welcome challenges as they're willing to sacrifice comfort.
*   **B: 沒有嚴格時間限制的人** - The text specifically says time is a sacrifice, making this group potentially suitable for this type of travel.
*   **C: 計劃在旅行時遠端工作的人** - This text focuses on limiting spending, not earning money while travelling. Therefore, it doesn't speak to their ability to do so.



"
關於波恩馬里恩和費爾蒙特之間的車程，以下說法何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 很少人遵守速度限制 (Few people observe the speed limit)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that speed limits are *lower* on this stretch of highway and that it's **even more important to obey them** than on other sections. This implies people *should* and likely *do* adhere to the speed limits because of the difficult driving conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 有長長的偏遠鄉村道路 (There are long stretches of remote country roads)** - The passage directly states this.
* **B: 車道很窄 (The lanes are narrow)** - The passage mentions ""narrow roads"".
* **D: 行動通訊服務應該不是問題 (Cell service should not be an issue)** - The passage says cell service is *better* here than in other areas.



"
根據這段文字，在水牛城─匹茲堡高速公路上行駛的駕駛應該主要關心哪些事項？,"The correct answer is **C: 急彎轉太快**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""陡坡、窄道和急彎占了絕大多數。"" and ""嚴格遵守這些速限甚至比其他路段更重要."" This points to the danger of navigating curves, especially at speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 困在擁擠的車陣中 (Being stuck in congested traffic):** The passage describes the area as ""偏僻的荒涼地區"" (remote and desolate), which doesn't suggest heavy traffic.
* **B: 缺乏足夠的行動通訊服務 (Lack of adequate cell service):** The passage actually says the *opposite* – cell service is *better* in this area than other parts of the highway.
* **D: 遇上頻繁的道路施工 (Encountering frequent road construction):** The passage doesn't mention any road construction.



"
如果要開始溪降，以下哪一點非必要？,"The correct answer is **B: 巔峰體能狀態 (Peak physical condition)**.

The passage states that canyoning has ""relatively low entry requirements in terms of training or physical condition (for example compared to climbing, scuba diving or skiing)"".  This directly contrasts with needing to be in peak physical condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 游泳的能力 (Ability to swim):** The passage states canyoning ""combines elements of swimming..."" so swimming is necessary.
*   **C: 跳躍能力 (Ability to jump):** The passage states canyoning ""combines elements of... jumping..."" so jumping is necessary.
*   **D: 少量訓練 (Some training):** The passage states canyoning requires relatively low training, but *some* training is still needed.



"
以下何者是成功的溪降之旅所不能少的？,"The correct answer is **D: 游泳能力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""溪降結合了游泳、攀爬和跳躍等要素..."" (Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing, and jumping...). This directly indicates swimming is a fundamental part of the activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 進階運動能力 (Advanced athletic ability):** The passage explicitly states that canyoning has *lower* entry requirements for training and physical condition compared to other sports.
* **B: 有水肺潛水經驗 (Scuba diving experience):** The passage contrasts canyoning with scuba diving, suggesting it doesn't *require* that experience.
* **C: 溪降認證 (Canyoning certification):** While certification is likely a good idea and potentially required for certain canyons, the passage doesn't state it's *essential* for a successful trip. It only mentions relatively low entry requirements.



"
根據這段文字，對於打算進行汽車露營的人來說，什麼事情會有所幫助？,"The correct answer is **B: 座椅能放平的車輛**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""如果您有一輛座椅能放平的大型迷你廂型車、休旅車、轎車或是旅行車，便能從事汽車露營。"" This directly links having a vehicle with seats that fold flat to being able to car camp.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 深入了解自身車輛的侷限 (Understanding your vehicle's limitations):** While the text *mentions* knowing your vehicle's limitations, it doesn't say this *helps* with car camping specifically – it's just a general note about driving.
* **C: 一頂帳篷 (A tent):** The text actually implies tents can *draw unwanted attention* making them less ideal for this type of travel.
* **D: 用於露營的私人土地 (Private land for camping):** The text suggests camping on private land *could* attract attention, which is something to avoid.



"
根據這段文字，如果汽車露營者希望保持低調，他們可能想要避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 在城裡或私人土地上搭帳篷** (Setting up a tent in towns or on private land).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""在私人土地或任何大小的城鎮搭起帳棚，都很容易引起不必要的注意。"" (Setting up a tent on private land or in any size town is likely to attract unwanted attention.)  This directly links camping in these locations to *not* being low-profile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 駕駛大型車輛，如休旅車或迷你廂型車** (Driving large vehicles such as SUVs or minivans) - The passage *encourages* using these vehicles *for* car camping.
* **B: 進行更長的公路之旅** (Taking longer road trips) - The length of the trip isn't mentioned as a factor in being low-profile.
* **D: 不熟悉自身使用的車輛** (Not being familiar with the vehicle being used) - The passage highlights the benefit of *knowing* your vehicle's limitations.



"
根據這段文字，是誰二度重建了卡薩布蘭卡？,"The correct answer is **D: 摩洛哥蘇丹 (Moroccan Sultan)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""摩洛哥蘇丹重建了這座城市，取名 「達魯 I 巴迪亞」。"" (The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it ""Dar al-Bayda""). 

While others (Portuguese, Spanish merchants) played roles in the city's history, the Moroccan Sultan is specifically identified as the one who *rebuilt* it after it was abandoned by the Portuguese.
"
在自然災害後，誰拋棄了現代城市卡薩布蘭卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 葡萄牙人**.

The text states: ""葡萄牙人將這座城市夷平重建，並命名為「Casa Branca」（白色房子），在 1755 年發生地震後又遺棄了這個地方。"" (The Portuguese leveled the city and rebuilt it, naming it ""Casa Branca"" (White House), and abandoned the place after the 1755 earthquake.)
"
根據這段文字，辛特拉是如何廣為外國人所知？,"The correct answer is **C: 拜倫男爵的正面評價 (Byron's positive depictions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""辛特拉，這裡對外國人來說非常有名，因為拜倫男爵曾對它的美景進行過鮮明的描繪 (Sintra is very famous for foreigners because Lord Byron vividly depicted its beauty).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 羅卡角 (Roca Cape):** While the bus *stops* at Roca Cape, it doesn't explain *why* Sintra is known to foreigners.
* **B: 聖母顯靈處 (Fatima Sanctuary):** Fatima is a separate location mentioned in the text, not the reason Sintra is famous.
* **D: 它浪漫的歷史 (Its romantic history):** The text mentions Sintra is ""romantic and charming,"" but doesn't state that *history* is the reason for its foreign fame - Byron's descriptions are.



"
亞美尼亞不承認什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 新共和國 (New republic)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...even Armenia did not recognize it."" ""It"" refers to the new republic that was formed with the support of Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 納戈爾諾－卡拉巴赫地區 (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** Armenia *supports* this region, they don't not recognize it.
*   **B: 對亞塞拜然人發動了戰爭 (The war launched against Azerbaijanis):** The passage states the region *launched* the war, not Armenia.
*   **C: 關於亞塞拜然的外交爭論 (Diplomatic disputes regarding Azerbaijan):** The dispute *harms* the relationship, but Armenia doesn't not recognize the dispute itself.



"
何者持續影響亞塞拜然與亞美尼亞之間的關係？,"The correct answer is **C: 外交爭論 (Diplomatic disputes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""關於此地區的外交爭論持續損害亞美尼亞和亞塞拜然之間的關係。"" (The diplomatic disputes concerning this region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 居住在亞塞拜然的亞美尼亞人 (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** While their presence is *part* of the conflict's context, the passage doesn't say they *continue* to damage relations.
*   **B: 1994 年的戰爭 (The 1994 war):** The war *caused* the issues, but it's the ongoing disputes *about* the region, not the war itself, that continuously affects the relationship.
*   **D: 納戈爾諾－卡拉巴赫地區 (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** The region is the *source* of the disputes, but the disputes themselves are what have the continuous effect.



"
在夏洛特搭乘計程車時，何者可能會導致額外費用？,"The correct answer is **B: 有三名乘客**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""超過兩名乘客需支付額外的費用"" (More than two passengers will incur extra fees). This directly relates to incurring additional costs when taking a taxi in Charlotte.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 居住在其他地區** - The passage mentions people *moving* to Charlotte, but not that residency affects taxi fares.
*   **C: 前往上城區** - The passage mentions the growth of kid-friendly activities *in* uptown Charlotte, but doesn't connect it to taxi costs.
*   **D: 家庭友善的態度** - This is a characteristic of Charlotte, not a factor in taxi pricing.



"
根據這段文字，帶著孩子在夏洛特一起生活有什麼缺點？,"The correct answer is **B: 搭乘計程車 (Taking taxis)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that while taxis *can* be convenient in certain situations, they can be more expensive for families because of extra passenger fees. This is presented as a potential drawback.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 房價 (Housing costs):** The passage doesn't mention anything about housing costs.
*   **C: 來自其他地區的居民 (Residents from other areas):** The passage actually says people *move* to Charlotte *because* it's family-friendly.
*   **D: 試圖享受這座城市 (Trying to enjoy the city):** The passage states that it's *easy* to enjoy the city with children.



"
在西班牙人抵達前，是誰控制了智利北部？,"The correct answer is **D: 印加人**.

The passage states: ""在西班牙人於 16 世紀抵達智利前，其北部受印加帝國統治..."" (Before the Spanish arrived in Chile in the 16th century, its north was ruled by the Inca Empire...).

Therefore, the answer is the Inca Empire. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 馬普切人** - The passage states they inhabited the *central and southern* parts of Chile, not the north.
*   **B: 美國人** - This is incorrect as the United States did not exist as a political entity at this time.
*   **C: 阿勞卡尼亞人** - This is synonymous with the Mapuche people; they lived in the center and south, not the north.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者未在 1810 年發生？,"正確答案是 **B: 智利戰勝西班牙**。

根據文章，智利在 1810 年宣布獨立，但直到 1818 年才擊敗西班牙取得決定性的勝利。

以下是其他選項為何錯誤的原因：

*   **A: 沒有中央政府** - 文章明確指出 1810 年西班牙「沒有正常運作的中央政府」。
*   **C: 時值拿破侖戰爭** - 文章指出智利在 1810 年宣布獨立時「正值拿破侖戰爭」。
*   **D: 智利宣布獨立** - 文章直接聲明智利在 1810 年「宣佈獨立」。"
人們如何到達利古里亞地區的偏遠村莊？,"The correct answer is **C: 搭乘火車或船 (Take a train or boat)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""步道、火車與船隻串起了村莊，而汽車卻無法從外頭開進這裡。"" (Trails, trains, and boats connect the villages, while cars cannot enter from outside.)

Therefore, you can reach the villages by train or boat, but *not* by car.
"
義大利文專門名稱「五鄉地」指的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 五座村莊** (Five villages).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states ""五鄉地，意思是五塊土地，由義大利利古里亞地區的五座濱海小村莊組成..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, meaning five lands, consists of five seaside villages..."".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 五條路** (Five roads) - The passage mentions trails, trains, and boats connecting the villages, but *not* roads for cars.
* **C: 五座山崖** (Five cliffs) - While the villages are *on* cliffs, ""Cinque Terre"" refers to the villages themselves.
* **D: 五大海** (Five seas) - The villages overlook the sea, but aren't seas themselves.
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的靴子適合冬季可能會有的濕滑狀況？,"The correct answer is **B: 具有鞋釘配備的靴子** (Boots equipped with studs).

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""有些靴子帶有鞋釘 (Some boots have studs)..."" and that these are helpful for slippery conditions.
* **The text also mentions:** removable studs that can be added to shoes and boots for better grip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 細跟靴 (High-heeled boots):** The text explicitly recommends *low* and *wide* heels.
* **C: 高跟靴 (High-heeled boots):** Same reasoning as A - high heels are dangerous on slippery surfaces.
* **D: 不具有 1/5 英寸鞋底紋路的靴子 (Boots without a 1/5 inch tread):** The text states that a tread depth of *at least* 5mm (1/5 inch) is necessary.



"
何者無助於改善冬季結冰路面的摩擦力？,"The correct answer is **D: Water**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that sand, gravel, and salt (calcium chloride) are *used to increase friction* on slippery surfaces. Water, on the other hand, *causes* the slippery conditions (ice and slush). 

Therefore, water doesn't help improve friction; it reduces it."
關於夏威夷和庫克群島之間的相似之處，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它們共用相同的時區**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""因為群島跟夏威夷同時區，所以有時又被稱為「南半球夏威夷」"" (Because the archipelago is in the same time zone as Hawaii, it is sometimes called ""Hawaii of the Southern Hemisphere"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它們都有很多大型飯店** - The passage suggests Cook Islands *lacks* the large hotels Hawaii has (""想起尚未成為美國一州、大型觀光飯店與其他開發案還沒進駐的夏威夷"" - remembers Hawaii before it became a US state, before large hotels and other developments moved in).
* **B: 它們都沒有獨立的國家地位** - The passage states the Cook Islands is a self-governing island country in free association with New Zealand. Hawaii *is* a US state.
* **D: 它們都沒有都市** - The passage says Cook Islands has no cities, but doesn't mention whether Hawaii has cities (it does).
"
關於庫克群島的描述，以下何者不正確？,"正確答案是 **C: 主要城市是拉羅湯加島及艾圖塔基島**。

原因：

文章中明確指出庫克群島**沒有任何城市**，而主要島嶼是拉羅湯加島及艾圖塔基島。 因此，說這些島嶼是主要城市是不正確的。

其他選項都是正確的：

*   **A: 它比夏威夷小** - 文章中提到庫克群島面積較小，讓人想起未開發的夏威夷。
*   **B: 它是群島** - 文章中明確說明庫克群島是由15個島嶼組成的群島。
*   **D: 這個島國與夏威夷共用相同時區** - 文章中指出庫克群島跟夏威夷同時區，因此又被稱為「南半球夏威夷」。
"
以下哪個林區管理站提供兩種類型的住宿選項？,"The correct answer is **A: 西雷納**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""只有西雷納林區管理站提供露營地以外的合宿房與熱食。"" (Only the Sirena ranger station offers lodging and hot food in addition to campsites.)

The other options only offer campsites and no food.
"
根據這段文字，如果你想付現而非使用信用卡付款，你可以在哪裡預訂公園通行證？,"The correct answer is **B: 希門尼斯港**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""You may be able to book permits directly from the park office in **Jimenez Port**, but they do not accept credit cards.""

This directly answers the question – you can pay cash at the park office in Jimenez Port.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 西雷納** - The text mentions you *need* a permit to stay in Sirena, but doesn't say you can book *permits* there.
*   **C: El Sol 網咖** - El Sol charges a fee for booking ($30 or $10) and doesn't specify whether they accept cash.
*   **D: 拉萊歐那** - La Leona only offers campsites, not permit booking."
根據這段文字，哪種滑雪是在更陡峭的地形上進行？,"The correct answer is **C: 阿爾卑斯式**.

Here's why:

The text states that *“此活動與阿爾卑斯式登山滑雪類似，但通常不涉及高山滑雪與登山，這兩種活動在陡峭地形中進行...”*  This directly links 阿爾卑斯式 (Alpine) skiing with steeper terrain, specifically mentioning it involves high alpine and mountaineering in those conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 滑雪登山 (Ski Mountaineering):** The text says this is *similar* to Alpine skiing, but doesn't define it as being specifically on steeper terrain.
*   **B: 山岳滑雪 (Mountaineering Skiing):** This is *mentioned* as being done in steep terrain *along with* alpine skiing, but isn’t the type of skiing itself.
*   **D: 滑雪背包客 (Ski Touring/Backcountry Skiing):** The text says this is like hiking, and doesn't emphasize steepness. It contrasts it with the more extreme alpine/mountaineering styles.



"
根據這段文字，對於追求更高速度的山岳滑雪者，什麼東西會有幫助？,"The correct answer is **D: 淨空的雪道**.

Here's why:

The text states that ski tourers (滑雪背包客) ""rarely achieve the speeds of unladen backcountry skiing on groomed runs."" This directly implies that **淨空的雪道 (groomed runs)** are what allow for higher speeds in skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 更堅固的雪靴 (More sturdy ski boots):** The text contrasts ski touring with high-alpine skiing which *requires* more robust boots, meaning they're *not* helpful for the type of skiing described in the passage.
*   **B: 沉重的背包 (Heavy backpack):** The passage describes this activity as being similar to hiking, implying the pack is a part of it, not something that enhances speed.
*   **C: 良好的狀況 (Good condition):** While good conditions are helpful, the text says distance can be slightly *longer* in good conditions, not that speed increases. It's about endurance, not velocity.



"
經歷逆向文化衝擊的旅客很難做到什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 重新適應國內文化 (re-adapt to their domestic culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that reverse culture shock makes it *particularly difficult* to readjust to one's own native culture. The entire passage focuses on the challenges faced when returning home after being accustomed to a different culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 適應新地方的文化 (adapt to a new place's culture)** - Reverse culture shock is about the difficulty of returning *home*, not adapting to a new place.
* **B: 保持耐心和諒解 (maintain patience and understanding)** - The passage says others may *lack* patience and understanding with returnees, but the difficulty isn't with the traveler's ability to be patient.
* **C: 出國旅行 (travel abroad)** -  The passage discusses what happens *after* traveling abroad, not the act of traveling itself.



"
根據這段文字，逆向文化衝擊對於哪種遊客而言可能特別困難？,"The correct answer is **B: 在國外生活時迅速適應的遊客 (Tourists who adapted quickly to the new culture while abroad)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""對於容易適應新文化的遊客來說，有時重新調整融入自身的本土文化反而特別難 (For tourists who are easily adaptable to new cultures, readjusting to their own native culture can sometimes be particularly difficult).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention that *experiencing* a difficult cultural shock makes reverse culture shock harder, only that quick adaptation does.
*   **C:** The passage contrasts reverse culture shock *with* the honeymoon phase, implying those still *in* the honeymoon phase wouldn't experience it.
*   **D:**  While the passage notes that others may be less patient with returnees, the *experience* of reverse culture shock isn't determined by the patience of others, but by the individual's adaptation.



"
人們應該避免對駝鹿做以下哪種事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 將牠們的潛在威脅程度降至最低**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** People might get too close because they *think* moose aren't dangerous. This implies a mistake in judging their potential threat.
* **Option C directly addresses this:** Minimizing their potential threat (thinking they aren't dangerous) leads to getting too close and being at risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 忽略牠們的存在 (Ignoring their presence):** The passage doesn't suggest ignoring moose, just not underestimating them.
* **B: 過度緩慢地靠近 (Approaching them too slowly):** The passage focuses on getting *too close*, not *how* you get close.
* **D: 從遠處觀察牠們 (Observing them from a distance):** This is actually a *safe* behavior and the opposite of what the passage warns against.



"
根據這段文字，關於駝鹿的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 牠們是天生就具有攻擊性的動物 (They are naturally aggressive animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""駝鹿（常稱為麋鹿）並非天生就具有攻擊性 (Moose are *not* naturally aggressive).""  Therefore, statement A contradicts the given information.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **B: 有時人們認為牠們不太可能造成危險 (Sometimes people think they are unlikely to be dangerous)** - The passage says ""如果人們認為駝鹿不太可能造成危險 (If people think moose are unlikely to be dangerous)...""
* **C: 牠們可能會因人們靠得太近而發動攻擊 (They may attack if people get too close)** -  ""...就可能會靠得太近而身處風險之中 (they may get too close and be at risk).""  This implies an attack is possible.
* **D: 如有必要，牠們會保護自己 (They will defend themselves if necessary)** - The passage states ""遭受威脅時會保護自己 (they will defend themselves when threatened).""



"
根據這段文字，以下何者對沙漠旅客來說最不危險？,"The correct answer is **B: 看見海市蜃樓造成的水的影像**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states seeing a mirage *is* dangerous because it leads to wasted energy and water.** Options C and D are directly stated as dangerous.
* **The passage explicitly warns about the danger of getting hypothermia on cold nights without warm clothes.** Option A is clearly dangerous.
* **Simply *seeing* the mirage itself isn't the danger, it's the reaction to it.**  The text doesn't say seeing a mirage is harmful; it says pursuing it is.

Therefore, just *seeing* a mirage is the least dangerous of the options provided.
"
以下何者未被提及為沙漠旅客的潛在威脅？,"The correct answer is **D: 曬傷**.

Here's why:

* **A: 缺水 (Dehydration)** - While not explicitly stated, the passage mentions wasting precious water chasing mirages, implying water scarcity is a serious concern.
* **B: 海市蜃樓 (Mirages)** - The passage directly warns about the danger of mirages leading travelers astray.
* **C: 失溫 (Hypothermia)** - The passage specifically states that deserts get extremely cold at night and warns about the risk of hypothermia without warm clothing.
* **D: 曬傷 (Sunburn)** - The passage discusses extreme heat, but *doesn't* mention sunburn as a threat.

Therefore, sunburn is the only option not mentioned in the passage.
"
根據這段文字，探險家抵達後，哪個群體的人口受到了很大的影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 泰諾人 (Taino people)**.

The text specifically states: ""在歐洲探險家抵達後的短短幾年內，塔伊諾城的人口遭到西班牙征服者大幅地削減。"" (Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, the population of Taino towns was drastically reduced by Spanish conquerors.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 海地人 (Haitians):** The text mentions Haiti as being on the same island, but doesn't discuss the impact on Haitians specifically.
*   **B: 加勒比人 (Caribs):** While the text mentions the Caribs were original inhabitants, it focuses on the impact on the Taino people after the explorers arrived.
*   **D: 西班牙人 (Spanish):** The text describes the Spanish *causing* the reduction in population, not being affected by it.



"
根據這段文字，加勒比人說的是哪種語言？,"The correct answer is **D: 阿拉瓦語**.

The text explicitly states: ""加勒比人說的是阿拉瓦語系..."" (The Caribbean people spoke the Arawak language family...).
"
將滑雪當成娛樂活動推廣一事應歸功於何人？,"The correct answer is **B: 挪威人**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia."" This directly links the promotion of skiing as a recreational activity to Norwegians.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 滑雪迷 (Ski enthusiasts):** Ski enthusiasts *enjoy* skiing, they didn't *promote* it as an activity.
*   **C: 穴居人 (Cave dwellers):** Cave paintings depict skiing, but they don't show promotion of the activity. It's evidence of the *existence* of skiing, not its promotion.
*   **D: 澳洲人 (Australians):** Australians are mentioned as the location *where* the first recreational ski club was opened, not *who* opened it.



"
根據這段文字，滑雪大約在何時首次被視為一項運動？,"The correct answer is **D: 17 世紀**.

Here's why:

The text states that mountain skiing *can be traced back to at least* the 17th century. This means it was happening as a practice (and likely evolving into a sport) around that time. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 18 世紀** - The text specifically mentions 17th century, not 18th.
*   **B: 西元前 5000 年** - This refers to depictions of skiing-like activities in cave paintings, not the start of skiing *as a sport*.
*   **C: 1861 年** - This is when the first recreational ski club was founded, but it doesn't mean skiing began as a sport *then*. It signifies a formalization of the activity, not its origin.



"
以下何者通常與東非沿岸最大的島嶼有關？,"The correct answer is **C: 野生動植物**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""馬達加斯加是其中最大的一座島，野生動植物豐富，使該島本身自成一塊大陸."" (Madagascar is the largest of these islands, with rich wildlife, making the island a continent unto itself).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 歐洲影響力:** While the passage mentions European influence, it doesn't specifically tie it to Madagascar.
*   **B: 伊斯蘭教:** Islam is mentioned in connection with Comoros and Mayotte, not Madagascar.
*   **D: 豪華度假村:** Luxury resorts are mentioned as a characteristic of the *smaller* islands, not Madagascar.



"
何者並非較小的東非群島屬性？ ,"正確答案是 **C: 以野生動植物聞名**。

以下是原因：

* **P段落說明**馬達加斯加以其豐富的野生動植物聞名，但這指的是*馬達加斯加*，而不是*較小*的島嶼。
* **P段落明確指出**較小的島嶼以其與法國的關係（A）和豪華度假村（B）聞名。
* **P段落也說明**大多數較小的島嶼是獨立國家（D）。

因此，以野生動植物聞名並不是描述較小島嶼的屬性，而是馬達加斯加的屬性。
"
根據這段文字，某些特別傳統的教堂會如何慶祝復活節？,"The correct answer is **B: 在週六晚上舉辦復活節守夜祈禱會** (holding an Easter Vigil service on Saturday night).

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""較傳統的教堂通常會在復活節週末的週六夜晚舉辦一場復活節守夜祈禱會，午夜到來時，參與的信眾會一齊慶祝耶穌的復活。"" (More traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil service on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, and the congregation celebrates Jesus' resurrection together as midnight arrives.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 舉行豐收儀式** (holding a harvest ritual) - The text *suggests* the tradition *may* originate from harvest rituals, but doesn't say churches *hold* them.
* **C: 為信眾會舉辦春季派對** (holding a spring party for the congregation) - The text doesn't mention spring parties.
* **D: 看日出** (watching the sunrise) - While watching the sunrise is mentioned as a tradition, it's not specifically linked to the *churches* described as being more traditional. It's a more general practice.



"
為了避免入境厄瓜多時的某些要求，古巴公民必須先擁有什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 美國綠卡**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""持有美國綠卡的古巴公民應前往厄瓜多領事館，獲得這些條件的豁免權."" This means holding a US green card allows Cuban citizens to be exempt from the invitation letter requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 自旅行日期起，具有 6 個月以上有效期限的護照** - While a passport with 6 months validity is *required*, it doesn't *avoid* requirements, it *meets* a requirement.
*   **B: 公證過的邀請函** - The passage states an invitation letter is generally *required*, not that having one avoids other issues.
*   **C: 證明停留時間的往返機票** - Like the passport, this is a *requirement*, not a way to avoid other requirements.



"
何者並非厄瓜多旅行要求的規劃目的？,"The correct answer is **A: 將旅客人數降至最低 (Minimize the number of travelers)**.

Here's why:

* **B: 讓遷徙活動更井然有序 (To make migration activities more orderly)** - This is explicitly stated in the passage: ""These requirements are to make migration activities between the two countries more orderly.""
* **C: 確認旅客的停留時間 (To confirm the length of stay of travelers)** - The requirement for return/onward tickets directly demonstrates the intention to confirm the length of stay.
* **D: 確保護照的有效期限 (To ensure passport validity)** - The passage clearly states a 6-month passport validity requirement.

The passage doesn't mention *reducing* the number of travelers. The goal is to *manage* the flow of travelers, not to prevent them from coming. Therefore, option A is the one that is *not* a planning purpose of the Ecuador travel requirements.



"
以下何者的花費國外比國內更高？,"The correct answer is **B: 高級眼鏡框**.

Here's why:

The passage states that genuine imported designer frames might be *more expensive* than they are in the country of origin.  The passage warns of the possibility of counterfeit designer frames, but even authentic ones can be pricier abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 眼科檢查 (Eye exams)**: The passage suggests getting an eye exam *before* traveling to get a prescription, implying it's cheaper to do it at home.
*   **C: 視力保險 (Vision insurance)**: The passage specifically recommends this if your insurance covers it.
*   **D: 非名牌眼鏡框 (Non-designer frames)**: The passage states that glasses are generally cheaper in countries with lower labor costs, and doesn't mention non-designer frames being an exception.



"
在國外購買高級眼鏡框可能會有什麼風險？,"The correct answer is **C: 眼鏡框可能是仿冒品**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""有些可能是仿冒品 (some may be counterfeit)."" This directly addresses the risk of buying branded frames abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 可能需要另外的眼科檢查 (May require an additional eye exam)** - The passage suggests getting an exam *before* traveling, not that you'll need one *in* the foreign country.
*   **B: 處方可能無法用於某些眼鏡框 (Prescription may not work for certain frames)** - The passage doesn't mention this as a risk.
*   **D: 保險可能不給付 (Insurance may not cover it)** - While the passage mentions insurance *coverage* is a benefit if available, it doesn't state it's a *risk* of buying abroad.



"
關於福克蘭群島的貨幣使用，以下哪種說法為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 除了福克蘭群島鎊 ，英鎊通常是接受度最高的貨幣**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""群島上各處一般可以接受英鎊"" (英鎊在群島上普遍被接受), making this the most accurate statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 外島僅接受信用卡和英鎊** - The passage says credit cards *may not* be accepted on outer islands, and suggests asking merchants what they accept.
*   **B: 史坦利是唯一接受美金的地方** - The passage states dollars are *often* accepted *within* Stanley.
*   **C: 福克蘭群島鎊應在離島後兌換** - The passage specifically says it is *almost impossible* to exchange FKP outside the Falkland Islands and to exchange before leaving.



"
根據這段文字，從美國到福克蘭群島旅行時，除了信用卡，其他付款方式在哪裡可能特別有用？,"The correct answer is **C: 外島**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""外島地區也許可以使用英美貨幣，但應該無法使用信用卡"". This means US dollars might be useful on the outer islands where credit cards are not accepted. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 福克蘭群島公司西店** - This is where you *exchange* currency, not where USD is necessarily useful for payments.
*   **B: 遍及所有島嶼** - The text doesn't say USD is widely accepted across all islands, only that it's *often* accepted in Stanley.
*   **D: 整個史坦利** - While USD is *sometimes* accepted in Stanley, the text specifically highlights its potential usefulness in the outer islands where other options are limited.



"
哪個事件與廟宇慶典的慶祝活動無關？,"正確答案是 **A: 大象的誕生**。

根據文章，廟宇慶典的目的是為了慶祝：

*   寺廟週年紀念日
*   主祀神祉的生日
*   與該廟宇相關的重要活動

文章提到大象會在慶典中遊行，但沒有提到大象的誕生是慶典的慶祝原因。因此，大象的誕生與廟宇慶典的慶祝活動無關。"
哪裡可以看到佩戴裝飾的大象？,"The correct answer is **D: 在喀拉拉邦的街道上**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""去喀拉拉邦看寺廟慶典挺有意思的，他們定期會有佩戴裝飾的大象遊行..."".  This directly implies you'll see decorated elephants in the streets of Kerala during temple festivals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 從十一月底到五月中旬到處可見** - This is the timeframe for the festivals, not *where* you see the elephants.
* **B: 在寺廟裡** - The text mentions elephants in *parades*, not specifically inside the temples.
* **C: 寺廟的遊行** - While correct that they're in parades, this doesn't specify the *location* of those parades. The parades happen *on the streets*.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者是購買商務艙或頭等艙機票最可能的省錢方式？,"The correct answer is **A: 經由您的公司支出 (Having your company pay)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""還有更好的方式，那就是讓公司出錢 (a better way is to have your company pay).""  This is presented as a viable alternative to paying out of pocket.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 預訂頭等艙而非商務艙 (Booking first class instead of business class)** - The passage states first class is *eleven* times the price of economy, making it more expensive, not a way to save money.
* **C: 預訂頭等艙非直飛航班 (Booking first class on a non-direct flight)** - The passage focuses on *direct* flights and doesn't mention anything about non-direct flights being cheaper.
* **D: 尋找優惠 (Looking for deals)** - The passage states that trying to find deals on business or first class is ""徒勞無益 (futile).""



"
根據這段文字，在預訂特定票價的艙等時，搜尋什麼會浪費時間？,"The correct answer is **C: 優惠**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""一般來說從甲地到乙地的直飛航班，試圖尋找商務艙或頭等艙座位優惠只是徒勞無益"" (Generally speaking, trying to find discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from point A to point B is futile).

This directly means searching for *discounts/offers* on those higher class seats is a waste of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 直飛航班 (Direct flights)** - The text mentions direct flights as the *context* where finding deals is futile, not as something to stop searching for.
*   **B: 商務艙 (Business class)** - The text doesn't say searching for business class is a waste of time, just that finding *deals* on it is.
*   **D: 頭等艙 (First class)** -  Similar to business class, the text doesn't say searching for first class is a waste of time, only finding *deals* on it.



"
在比較非洲的總票價與環球票價時，不需要加上什麼額外費用？,"The correct answer is **B: 非洲離境稅的費用**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""In places outside of Africa, don't forget to add extra costs such as additional visas, **departure taxes**, and ground transportation.""  The question asks what costs *don't* need to be added when comparing African fares to round-the-world fares. Since departure taxes (離境稅) are specifically mentioned as being relevant to places *outside* Africa, they are not extra costs you need to consider *when comparing African fares*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 非洲以外的地方所需的額外簽證費用** - The passage explicitly states to add extra visa costs for places outside of Africa.
*   **C: 非洲簽證的費用** - While not directly mentioned in the comparison, visa costs for Africa would be relevant when traveling *to* Africa.
*   **D: 非洲以外的地方所需的地面交通費用** - The passage states to include ground transportation costs outside of Africa."
根據這段文字，超市開始提供什麼更多樣化的選擇？,"The correct answer is **A: 即食品 (Ready-to-eat foods)**.

The text specifically states: ""越來越多超市開始提供更多樣化的**即食品**..."" (More and more supermarkets are starting to offer a more diverse selection of **ready-to-eat foods**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 微波爐 (Microwaves):** While the text mentions some supermarkets *provide* microwaves, it's not what they are diversifying.
* **C: 附設餐廳 (Attached restaurants):** The text says some have restaurants, but this isn't the *increasing diversification* it's referring to.
* **D: 實惠的價格 (Affordable prices):** The text mentions affordability of restaurants, not as a diversification of the supermarket itself.



"
部分超市提供的哪些便利設施可能會吸引購買即食品的顧客？,"The correct answer is **D: 微波爐**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""越來越多超市開始提供更多樣化的即食品，部分超市甚至提供微波爐或其他設備以食物加熱。"" This directly links microwaves to attracting customers who buy ready-made food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 附設餐廳** - While the passage mentions attached restaurants, it doesn't say they attract *ready-made food* customers specifically, but rather offer an alternative eating option within the store.
* **B: 較少變化的選擇** - The passage actually states supermarkets are offering *more* variety, making this incorrect.
* **C: 生食** - Ready-made foods are *cooked*, not raw. The passage contrasts them with buying ingredients and cooking yourself.



"
講法語的比利時人和瑞士人可能聽不懂以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 標準的法文記數系統 (Standard French counting system)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Belgians and Swiss *learn* the standard French counting system in school *so that* others can understand them. This implies that their native counting systems are different and potentially confusing to standard French speakers, but they can *understand* the standard system when it's used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 奇特的法文單字 (Peculiar French words):** The passage mentions that some words have slight differences in pronunciation, suggesting Belgians and Swiss would likely understand peculiar words.
* **C: 法文單字的某些發音 (Some pronunciations of French words):**  The passage directly states there are minor pronunciation differences, but still enough similarity for understanding.
* **D: 法國最常說的法文 (Most commonly spoken French in France):** The passage says Belgians and Swiss can understand standard French and therefore, the most common French spoken in France.



"
以下何者在法國與在比利時或瑞士不同？,"The correct answer is **B: 記數系統 (Counting systems)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""比利時法語區與瑞士的計數系統有些奇特，與法國所說的法語不同..."" (The counting systems in the French-speaking regions of Belgium and Switzerland are somewhat peculiar, different from the French spoken in France...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 所有單字的發音 (All word pronunciations)** - The passage says there are *slight* differences in pronunciation, not that all pronunciations are different.
* **C: 學校教授的標準法語 (Standard French taught in schools)** -  The passage states that everyone in Belgium and Switzerland *learns* standard French in school, meaning it's the same standard.
* **D: 某些法語單字的拼寫 (The spelling of certain French words)** - The passage does *not* mention any differences in spelling.



"
哪種情況您不太可能得到喪親票價？,"正確答案是 **C: 如果您從巴黎搭乘漢莎航空飛往美國**。

理由：

文章中明確指出漢莎航空的喪親票價僅適用於**從美國或加拿大出發的航班**。從巴黎出發不在適用範圍內。

其他選項不正確的原因：

*   **A: 如果您搭乘的是西捷航空** - 西捷航空是提供喪親票價的航空公司之一。
*   **B: 如果您嘗試直接透過航空公司而非第三方服務訂票** - 文章明確指出必須直接跟航空公司訂位。
*   **D: 如果您搭乘的是達美航空** - 達美航空是提供喪親票價的航空公司之一。"
關於喪親票價，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 必須直接打電話向航空公司預訂**.

The passage explicitly states: ""不論任何情況，都必須打電話直接跟航空公司訂位。"" (Regardless of the situation, you must call the airline directly to book.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 票價包含支付葬禮旅行的費用** - The passage says the fare provides a *slight discount* for travel to a funeral, not that it covers funeral costs.
*   **B: 必須直接在航空公司的網站上預訂** - The passage states you must *call* the airline, not book online.
*   **C: 票價包含了最後限時機票的旅費** - The passage does not mention anything about last-minute tickets."
何時使用獨立的 GPS 設備比 GPS 導航應用程式更方便？,"The correct answer is **C: 超出連線範圍時 (When out of network coverage)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""如果你的手機沒有數據連線，或者已經超出連線範圍，GPS 導航的表現可能會受到限制或無法使用。"" (If your phone doesn't have a data connection, or is already out of range, GPS navigation performance may be limited or unusable.) This directly implies that a standalone GPS device would be *more* convenient in that situation because it doesn't rely on a data connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 想省錢時 (When wanting to save money):** The passage states using a phone app is *cheaper* than buying maps or renting from a rental company.
*   **B: 確定會有數據連線時 (When there's guaranteed data connection):** The app works best *with* a data connection, so this isn't a situation where a standalone device would be preferable.
*   **D: 不想租用 GPS 設備時 (When not wanting to rent a GPS device):** This is a reason to *use* the app, not a reason a standalone device is better.



"
與獨立設備相比，何者並非使用 GPS 導航應用程式的好理由？,"The correct answer is **A: 無需擔心數據連線**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically states* that GPS navigation apps are **limited or unusable** without a data connection or outside of coverage.  Therefore, not needing to worry about data connection is *not* a benefit.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits, according to the passage:

* **B: 省錢 (Saving money)** - The passage states it's cheaper than buying new maps or renting from a car company.
* **C: 避免租賃 (Avoiding rentals)** -  As above, the passage says it avoids the need to rent maps.
* **D: 無需購買新地圖 (No need to buy new maps)** - The passage directly compares it favorably to buying new maps.
"
根據這段文字，您如何保證您配到一艘適合的船？,"The correct answer is **C: 與身為加拉巴哥群島旅行專家的旅行社預訂**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""確保幫您預訂的旅行社是加拉巴哥群島的專家，並擁有對各種船隻的廣泛知識。 這將確保您的特定興趣和/或限制會與最適合它們的船隻相符。""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text doesn't mention booking with a group of similar interests.
*   **B:** While booking in the off-season might be easier, it doesn't guarantee a suitable boat for *your* interests.
*   **D:** Booking early is recommended, but it doesn't guarantee the boat will be a good fit – you need expert advice.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者並非用來讓賓客不斷賭博的策略？,"The correct answer is **A: 充足的自然光線 (Abundant natural light)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states casinos *avoid* things like windows (and therefore natural light) and clocks to disorient guests and keep them gambling.  The passage *does* mention:

* **B: 免費音樂會門票等鼓勵措施 (Free concert tickets and other incentives):** Casinos provide entertainment.
* **C: 免費飲料 (Free drinks):** Casinos often offer free alcoholic beverages.
* **D: 沒有時鐘 (No clocks):** Casinos lack clocks to distort guests' sense of time.

Therefore, *providing* ample natural light would work *against* the casino's strategy of keeping people gambling longer."
根據這段文字，聰明的賭徒應該避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 飲酒過量**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states, ""喝醉酒可是會削減判斷力，好的賭徒都很清楚保持清醒的重要性。"" (Drinking too much impairs judgment, and good gamblers are very aware of the importance of staying sober.) This directly links avoiding excessive alcohol consumption to being a smart gambler.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 接受任何鼓勵措施:** While casinos offer perks, the text doesn't say smart gamblers should avoid them, just that casinos *use* them to keep people playing.
*   **C: 檢查時鐘或手錶:** The text mentions casinos don't have clocks, but doesn't say a smart gambler should avoid trying to find the time.
*   **D: 詢問最近的出口:** The text notes exits are hard to find, but doesn't suggest a smart gambler shouldn't *try* to locate them.



"
根據這段文字，句子中哪個詞性會大寫？,"The correct answer is **B: 名詞**.

The text explicitly states: ""所有名詞以及 Sie （意思為'您'）一詞，即使在句子中間出現，仍然會以大寫字母開頭。"" (All nouns and the word 'Sie' (meaning 'you') are capitalized, even when they appear in the middle of a sentence.)

The text also mentions the difficulty in distinguishing between verbs and adjectives *because* nouns are capitalized, implying those aren't routinely capitalized.
"
根據這段文字，名詞大寫會讓什麼事更困難？,"The correct answer is **C: 寫作**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...but due to the need to confirm whether a verb or adjective should be used in the nominalized form, **writing becomes a bit complex**."" 

The passage directly says that the capitalization of nouns *makes writing* more difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 閱讀 (Reading)** - The passage suggests capitalization *might* make reading *easier*, not harder.
* **B: 區分動詞 (Distinguishing verbs)** - The passage mentions distinguishing verbs is important, but doesn't say capitalization makes it *harder* to do so.
* **D: 區分受詞 (Distinguishing objects)** - Similar to verbs, the passage highlights the importance of distinguishing objects, but doesn't say capitalization makes it harder.



"
在馬來西亞鄉下地區，哪個手勢代表「過來」？,"The correct answer is **B: 揮手**.

Here's why: The passage states that in Malaysia, or at least among rural Malays, waving a hand represents ""come here,"" similar to beckoning with a bent index finger in some Western countries. Therefore, waving is the hand gesture for ""come here"" in that context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 彎食指 (bent index finger)** - The passage says waving is *similar* to this gesture, but the waving *is* the gesture for ""come here"".
*   **C: 擊掌 (high-five)** - The passage does not mention high-fives.
*   **D: 豎起大拇指 (thumbs up)** - The passage does not mention thumbs up."
根據這段文字，哪個手勢可能代表「回來」？,"The correct answer is **A: 手掌朝內的揮手**.

Here's why:

The text states that in Spain, British travelers might *interpret* a hand gesture with the palm facing the wavier as meaning ""come back."" This is because it's different from the usual way of waving goodbye.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 彎食指** - The text mentions this as being similar to ""come here"" in some Western countries, not ""come back"".
* **C: 手掌朝外的揮手** - This is the standard ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" wave, not the one potentially meaning ""come back"".
* **D: 點頭** - Nodding isn't mentioned in the text at all.



"
根據這段文字，什麼狀況會導致隙縫發生？,"The correct answer is **B: 不穩定的冰河 (Unstable glaciers)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""冰河並不穩定，而是會順著山脈流下。這種狀況會導致冰體斷裂或有隙縫...""  This directly links unstable glaciers to the formation of crevasses (隙縫).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 雪橋 (Snow bridges):** While snow bridges *cover* crevasses, they don't *cause* them.
* **C: 坍塌的冰穴 (Collapsing ice caves):** Ice cave collapses are a hazard *within* a glacier, but don't necessarily create the initial crevasses.
* **D: 鬆動的冰塊 (Loose ice blocks):** Loose ice blocks fall *from* the glacier edge, but aren't the primary cause of crevasses forming within the ice mass.



"
根據這段文字，哪些東西會被雪橋遮蓋？,"The correct answer is **A: 隙縫**.

The text specifically states: ""...但可能會被雪橋掩蓋 (but may be covered by snow bridges)."" and refers to ""隙縫 (fissures)"" immediately before.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 冰穴 (Ice caves):** The text mentions ice caves might *collapse*, not be covered.
* **C: 冰壁 (Ice walls):** The text mentions ice walls of ice caves might *collapse*, not be covered.
* **D: 巨大的冰塊 (Huge ice blocks):** The text says these *fall* and *bounce/roll*, not that they are covered.



"
根據這段文字，旅客到訪哪個地點之前應採取額外的預防措施？,"The correct answer is **B: 戈馬周邊地區**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""While Goma is relatively safe, travel outside of Goma requires research into the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province."" This directly indicates that extra precautions are needed when traveling *outside* of Goma, into the surrounding areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 尼拉貢戈火山** - The text mentions it's a base for climbing the volcano, but doesn't suggest extra precautions *for the volcano itself*.
*   **C: 市中心** - The text says the city center was destroyed by lava, but doesn't imply current danger or the need for extra precautions.
*   **D: 盧安達** - The text only states Goma is *near* Rwanda, not that visiting Rwanda requires extra precautions.



"
對戈馬的遊客來說，以下何者並非好意見？,"The correct answer is **A: 北基伍省的戰亂很好玩**. 

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you need to ""do your homework and understand the ongoing unrest in North Kivu province"" before traveling *outside* of Goma. This implies the unrest is *not* something to be taken lightly or considered enjoyable.  In fact, it's a serious safety concern.

Let's look at why the other options are good advice based on the text:

*   **B:** The text mentions Goma is a place for ""some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.""
*   **C:** The text says you can use ""Boda-boda (motorbike taxis)"" to get around Goma.
*   **D:** The text states Goma is ""a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.""



"
8 月 1 日的野地許可證何時可用？,"The correct answer is **B: 4 月 1 日**.

Here's why:

The text states you can apply for permits four months in advance. To camp on August 1st, you need a permit for August. Four months prior to August is April. Therefore, the permits become available on April 1st.
"
為了保護峽谷而實行了什麼政策？,"The correct answer is **D: 許可證的數量有限 (Permit numbers are limited)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""為了保護峽谷，許可證的數量有限 (To protect the canyon, the number of permits is limited)."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 先到先得的許可證制度 (First-come, first-served permit system)** - While there *are* some first-come, first-served options for walk-up permits, the main system isn't entirely based on this. It's about limited availability and applying in advance.
* **B: 許可證僅在 1 月 1 日可申請 (Permits are only available for application on January 1st)** - The passage states permits are available on the 1st of each month, *for trips four months later*.
* **C: 許可證僅能現場登記取得 (Permits can only be obtained by on-site registration)** - The passage says on-site registration is *limited* and first-come, first-served, but doesn't say it's the *only* way to get a permit.



"
在文中所述的飯店類型中，最不可能找到以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 近期經過現代升級翻修的客房 (Recently modernized rooms)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that these hotels are characterized by their *age* and *lack of modern amenities*.** They retain ""outdated hardware"" and don't have ""new appliances.""  Modern renovations would directly contradict this core characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are likely *found* in these hotels:

* **A: 雞尾酒吧 (Cocktail bars):** The passage mentions ""high-end dining and nightlife,"" and cocktail bars were a common feature of luxury hotels during the eras described.
* **B: 飯店附設的美食餐廳 (Gourmet restaurants):** Again, ""high-end dining"" is specifically mentioned.
* **C: 知名或一眼就能認出的其他客人 (Notable or recognizable fellow guests):** The passage states these hotels historically hosted ""wealthy elites"" and sometimes ""visiting heads of state.""  It's very plausible that guests would be people of note.



"
根據段落所提供的資訊，飯店客人最不可能優先考慮以下哪些設施？,"The correct answer is **D: 實惠的房價 (Affordable pricing)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that these hotels catered to the wealthy.** They were frequented by ""富豪名流 (wealthy elites)"" and are now often considered destinations for ""手頭闊綽的旅客 (well-heeled travelers).""
* **The passage highlights luxury and history, not budget-friendliness.** It mentions ""高級的餐點和夜生活 (high-end dining and nightlife)"" and ""特有的優雅年代感 (a unique sense of bygone elegance).""
* **Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as features of these hotels:**
    * **A: 遍布飯店的古董傢俱 (Antique furniture throughout the hotel)** - This is implied by the hotels retaining ""遺跡 (relics)"" and having an ""優雅年代感 (elegant feel of a bygone era).""
    * **B: 擁有傑出廚師的餐廳 (Restaurants with outstanding chefs)** - The passage explicitly states ""高級的餐點 (high-end dining).""
    * **C: 提供夜間娛樂的酒吧 (Bars offering nighttime entertainment)** - The passage explicitly states ""夜生活 (nightlife).""

Therefore, it's *least* likely that guests staying at these hotels would prioritize affordability. They are described as places for the wealthy to indulge in luxury.
"
根據這段文字，前往格陵蘭島的旅客應該避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 將格陵蘭島原住民稱為「愛斯基摩人」**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""雖然美國仍可接受「愛斯基摩人」一詞，但許多非美裔的北極地區人民，尤其是加拿大人，卻視之為貶義...外國人應該避免使用。""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 以高犯罪率而聞名的特定地區:** The text says crime is *unheard of* and there are no ""dangerous areas.""
* **B: 帶上厚重的衣服，因為氣候全年溫暖:** The text specifically warns travelers to bring warm clothes, especially during colder seasons.
* **C: 以為能在那裡工作，因為網路連線可能不穩定:** The text states that internet access is *very developed* in Greenland with 93% of the population having access.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者最有可能對毫無準備就到訪格陵蘭島的旅客造成問題？,"The correct answer is **C: 天氣 (Weather)**.

The text specifically states: ""The only real danger an unprepared person is likely to encounter is the cold weather."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 北歐蚊子 (Northern European mosquitoes):** While annoying, the text says they ""do not transmit any diseases.""
* **B: 犯罪 (Crime):** The text states that crime is ""virtually unheard of"" in Greenland.
* **D: 當地人 (Locals):** The text explicitly states that hostility towards foreigners is rare.



"
以下何者現在當作中央廣場使用？,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""如今此空間被當作中央廣場，不論日夜都十分熱鬧。"" and ""此空間"" refers to Jardín de la Unión.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 親吻小巷 (Callejon del Beso)** - It's described as the origin of a love story, not a plaza.
* **C: 聖地牙哥聖殿 (Templo de San Diego)** - It's a surviving building *within* the area, but not the plaza itself.
* **D: Callejon del Beso（親吻小巷）** - Same as B, it's a specific location, not the central square.
"
根據這段文字，在 Jardín de la Unión 中找不到以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 古老的修道院建築 (Ancient monastery building)**.

Here's why:

*   **The text states:** ""聖地牙哥聖殿 (Templo de san Diego) 是該修道院碩果僅存的建築"" (Templo de San Diego is the *only surviving* building of the monastery). This means the *rest* of the monastery is gone.
*   The text *does* mention:
    *   **A: 有音樂會的中央涼亭 (Central gazebo with concerts):** ""下午和晚上通常在中央涼亭有免費演奏會""
    *   **B: 古老愛情故事的故鄉 (Birthplace of an old love story):** ""Callejon del Beso（親吻小巷）。古老愛情傳說的發源地""
    *   **C: 面對花園的餐廳 (Restaurants facing the garden):** ""花園周圍有幾間餐廳""

Therefore, the text doesn't indicate that you can find an *entire* ancient monastery building within Jardín de la Unión, only a single temple remaining from it."
根據這段文字，關於單日健行的說法中，以下何者會被認為不正確？,"正確答案是 **D: 單日健行這樣的戶外活動不適合有嬰兒的家庭**。

理由：

文章明確指出：「帶著幼兒的家庭可能需要更多準備，不過就算是帶著嬰兒或是學齡前兒童，戶外一日遊也可以簡單達成。」這直接反駁了選項D的說法。

其他選項皆正確，因為：

*   **A**：文章中提到「輕鬆小徑的一日健行，不必做太多準備」。
*   **B**：文章中定義單日健行為「一英里以下或更長距離的單日行程」。
*   **C**：文章中提到「任何體能適中的人都能享受這樣的健行」。"
根據這段文字，單日健行何時需要最低程度的準備？,"The correct answer is **B: 涉及更輕鬆的步道時**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""輕鬆小徑的一日健行，不必做太多準備，任何體能適中的人都能享受這樣的健行。"" This directly connects easy trails with requiring less preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 健行人士體有足夠的體能時:** While fitness helps *enjoy* a hike, the text doesn't say it reduces preparation *needed*.
*   **C: 孩子們去健行時:** The text specifically says families with young children may need *more* preparation.
*   **D: 在更自然的環境中健行時:** The text doesn't mention the environment impacting the level of preparation needed. It focuses on the trail difficulty.



"
與挪威其他地區相比，羅加蘭或阿格德爾的高原有何不同？,"The correct answer is **D: 它們通常佈滿石南花 (They are often covered in heather)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that in Rogaland and Agder, ""vidde"" (highlands) are often called ""hei"" which *means* areas often covered in heather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它們有樹 (They have trees)** - The passage explicitly states ""vidde"" are treeless spaces.
* **B: 沒有峽灣 (No fjords)** - The passage describes fjords as being *adjacent* to the highlands, not absent.
* **C: 高原大多很平坦 (The highlands are mostly flat)** - While the passage says the highlands are relatively flat compared to the steep fjords, it doesn't say they are *mostly* flat. It describes them as ""wide open spaces.""



"
根據這段文字，對挪威來說，以下何者並非典型的風景？,"The correct answer is **B: 森林茂密的高原**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""vidde"" (plateaus) are ""wide open spaces without trees"" and ""hei"" are ""treeless wildernesses"". This directly contradicts the idea of *forest-covered* highlands being typical Norwegian scenery. The passage *does* mention steep fjords (C) and open land/wilderness (A & D) as typical features.

Therefore, B is the only option that doesn't align with the description in the text.
"
對滑雪有興趣的遊客應何時到訪山間小鎮？,"The correct answer is **A: 冬季期間**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mountain towns get significant snowfall *in the winter* and offer skiing and snowboarding activities *then*.  The question asks when someone interested in skiing should visit, so winter is the logical answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 旺季期間:** While winter *is* peak season for these towns, the question is specifically about skiing.
* **C: 印度的夏季期間:** The passage says these towns are popular *during* India's summer, as a place to escape the heat, but doesn't mention skiing.
* **D: 春季期間:** Spring is mentioned as not being the time for snow activities.



"
根據這段文字，山間小鎮通常何時遊客最多？,"The correct answer is **C: 印度的夏季期間 (During the Indian summer)**.

The text states: ""避暑勝地的旅遊季節，通常在印度的夏季期間達到頂峰。"" (The tourist season in hill stations usually peaks during the Indian summer.)

While the text *also* mentions winter activities, it specifically states the *peak* season is during the summer.
"
如果希望找到尋求幫助的船，應該避免做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 在碼頭走來走去 (Walking around the dock)**.

The passage *explicitly states* you **should** walk around the dock as part of the process of finding work.  Therefore, avoiding that is something you shouldn't do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 與船長交朋友 (Making friends with captains):** The passage encourages you to talk to yacht owners (which includes captains) and boat crews.
* **C: 宣傳您的服務 (Advertising your services):** The passage advises you to ""post notices offering help,"" which is advertising your services.
* **D: 忽略其他搭便船的人 (Ignoring other hitchhikers):**  The passage states you'll ""meet other hitchhikers"" who will share information.



"
在尋找需要幫助的船時，應該在碼頭周圍做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 與船員攀談 (Talk to crew members)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""try to strike up conversations with the sailors in the bars."" It also emphasizes generally talking to *as many people as possible* - sailors, yacht owners, and even other hitchhikers. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 保持低調 (Keep a low profile)** - The passage advises the opposite - being proactive and making yourself known.
* **C: 僅在人們洗遊艇時接近他們 (Only approach people when they are washing their yachts)** - While approaching yacht owners is mentioned, it's not the *only* thing to do, and the passage encourages a broader range of interactions.
* **D: 避免其他搭便船的人 (Avoid other hitchhikers)** - The passage specifically says you'll *meet* other hitchhikers and they will *share information* with you.



"
何處會吸引對島上殖民歷史感興趣的遊客？,"The correct answer is **A: 北部沿岸 (Northern coastline)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""英國殖民者把這裡據為已有，因此如果想在這片土地上尋找殖民歷史的證據，這裡是個不錯的起點。"" and ""香港島的都市發展絕大部份都集中在北部沿岸的海埔新生地上。""  This clearly indicates the northern coastline of Hong Kong Island is where evidence of colonial history can be found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 九龍海濱 (Kowloon waterfront):** The passage mentions this as a good spot to *view* Hong Kong, not for colonial history.
*   **C: 香港市中心 (Hong Kong city center):** The passage doesn't specifically link the city center to colonial history.
*   **D: 維多利亞港 (Victoria Harbour):**  The passage describes it as a scenic backdrop, but not a place to find historical evidence."
何處會吸引優先考慮壯麗景色的遊客？,"The correct answer is **D: 九龍海濱**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""若要欣賞香港最好的景色，你可以離開香港島並前往對岸的九龍海濱。"" (If you want to appreciate the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and go to the Kowloon waterfront.)

While the passage mentions Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbour, it specifically highlights the Kowloon waterfront as the place to go for *the best* views.
"
有些馬鞍具備什麼東西，有助減少騎士的腳被馬鐙卡住的風險？,"The correct answer is **B: 安全手把 (Safety handles)**.

The passage specifically states: ""有些馬鞍 (尤其英式馬鞍) 具備安全手把，騎乘者墜馬時往後拉，就可讓馬蹬上的皮帶從馬鞍上脫落。"" (Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that, when pulled back on during a fall, can release the straps from the stirrups.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 狹窄的鞋底 (Narrow soles):** While the passage mentions narrow soles on boots, this is about *helping* a rider stay in the stirrup, not preventing being *trapped*.
* **C: 馬蹬上的皮帶 (Stirrup straps):** The safety handle *releases* the straps, it doesn't help reduce the risk directly.
* **D: 更高的穩定性 (Greater stability):** The passage states stirrups *provide* more stability, but doesn't say this reduces the risk of getting caught. In fact, it highlights the opposite – increased stability can lead to a more dangerous drag if a foot *is* caught.



"
使用馬鐙時，馬靴的哪些功能有助於提高騎士的安全性？,"The correct answer is **C: 鞋跟**.

Here's why:

The passage states that most riders wear boots ""with heels and smooth, narrow soles."" It specifically mentions the heel as a feature of the boots. While the narrow sole is also mentioned, the passage doesn't directly link it to safety *in the same way* as the heel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 粗糙狹窄的鞋底 (Rough narrow soles):** The passage mentions *smooth* not rough soles.
*   **B: 皮帶 (Stirrups):** Stirrups themselves are the safety concern, not a safety feature of the boot.
*   **D: 寬大的鞋底 (Wide soles):** The passage states the soles are *narrow* not wide.



"
住宿交換網站能為旅客提供什麼服務？,"The correct answer is **A: 與當地房東的住宿 (Accommodation with local hosts)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""住宿交換網站是一個能將遊客和他們欲前往的城市當地人連結起來的組織"" (Accommodation exchange websites are organizations that connect travelers with locals in the cities they want to visit.) This directly describes providing accommodation through local hosts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 廉價班機 (Cheap flights):** The passage mentions Casey Fenton *found* a cheap flight, but the website itself doesn't *provide* them.
* **C: 當地導遊提供的旅遊 (Tours provided by local guides):** The passage doesn't mention tours.
* **D: 與目的地相同的其他旅客一起轉機 (Connecting with other travelers heading to the same destination):** The focus is on connecting with *locals*, not other travelers.



"
根據這段文字，關於住宿交換網站的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 總會提供旅客當地房東的參考資料 (Always provides travelers with references for local hosts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that host lists are provided, and *occasionally* include recommendations and reviews from other travelers. It doesn't say that references are *always* provided. It's possible some listings might not have any references.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: 某些網站可能會要求旅客進行額外驗證 (Some websites may require travelers to undergo additional verification)** - The text explicitly states ""although some networks offer or require additional verification.""
*   **C: 會提供旅客目的地城市可供選擇的房東列表 (Provides travelers with a list of hosts to choose from in their destination city)** - The passage says ""A list of available hosts is provided either in print or online...""
*   **D: 有時會提供旅客當地房東的評價 (Sometimes provides travelers with reviews of local hosts)** - The text says ""...occasionally with recommendations and reviews from other travelers.""



"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的房客最不可能在青年旅館宿舍房中找到？,"The correct answer is **C: 帶小孩旅行的房客 (Families with children)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""帶著小孩的家庭極為少見 (families with children are very rare)"" in hostels. While some hostels *might* allow them in private rooms, they are not common. The passage implies that dorm rooms are not suited for families with children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 二十出頭的房客 (Guests in their 20s):** The passage states that this is the *typical* hostel guest.
*   **B: 獨自旅行的房客 (Solo travelers):** The passage doesn't say anything about solo travelers being uncommon. In fact, hostels are popular with solo travelers.
*   **D: 三十多歲的房客 (Guests in their 30s):** The passage says older travelers *are* often seen at hostels, implying people in their 30s are not unusual.



"
根據這段文字，誰最有可能住在青年旅館？,"The correct answer is **B: Three 22-year-olds traveling together.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""青年旅社的主要客群是年輕人，典型房客是 20 來歲的年輕人..."" (Youth hostels primarily cater to young people, with typical guests being in their 20s).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: A couple traveling with a newborn:** The text specifically says families with children are *rare* at youth hostels.
* **C: A couple in their 70s:** While the text says *older* travelers are sometimes seen, the primary demographic is much younger.
* **D: Two families traveling with children:** Again, the text explicitly states families with children are uncommon.
"
根據這段文字，關於迴力鏢投擲的描述，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 只有部分迴力鏢能夠飛回來 (Only some boomerangs can return)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""大部分澳洲的迴力鏢其實是不會飛回來的 (Most Australian boomerangs actually do not return)."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 如果正確投擲，它一定會回到你的手中 (If thrown correctly, it will definitely return to your hand):** The text says you need a *suitable* boomerang to return, and even then doesn't guarantee a return with every throw (especially in wind).
* **B: 比起遊客，它在當地人之間更熱門 (It is more popular among locals than tourists):** The text doesn't mention the popularity among locals.
* **C: 澳洲能買迴力鏢的地方並不多 (There aren't many places to buy boomerangs in Australia):** The text doesn't discuss the availability of boomerangs for purchase.



"
爪哇美食主要使用以下哪一種調味料？,"The correct answer is **C: 椰子糖**.

The text specifically states that ""糖（尤其是爪哇椰子糖）"" is a commonly used seasoning in Javanese cuisine. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 白糖** - While sugar is mentioned generally, coconut sugar is highlighted as *especially* common.
*   **B: 糖粉** - The text doesn't mention powdered sugar.
*   **D: 黑糖** - While related to coconut sugar, the text specifically mentions *爪哇椰子糖*.



"
根據這段文字，傳染病是如何傳播的？,"The correct answer is **A: 受感染者 (Infected individuals)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""傳染病是人在受感染者附近便容易被傳播的疾病"" which translates to ""Contagious diseases are diseases that are easily spread when people are near those who are infected.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 病原體 (Pathogens)** - While pathogens *cause* infectious diseases, the text specifically says contagious diseases spread *from* infected individuals.
* **C: 細菌 (Bacteria)** - Bacteria are a *type* of pathogen, but not the method of transmission for contagious diseases in general.
* **D: 疫苗 (Vaccines)** - Vaccines *prevent* diseases; they don't *spread* them.



"
根據這段文字，何者並非導致傳染病的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 疫苗**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""傳染性疾病是由病毒、細菌、真菌或其他寄生蟲等病原體造成的疾病."" (Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasites).
* The passage also mentions vaccines are *used to prevent* diseases, not *cause* them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 病毒 (Viruses):** Explicitly mentioned as a cause of infectious diseases.
* **C: 細菌 (Bacteria):** Explicitly mentioned as a cause of infectious diseases.
* **D: 真菌 (Fungi):** Explicitly mentioned as a cause of infectious diseases.



"
在哪種情況下，對使用者來說，選擇網路代理伺服器而非個人 VPN 供應商就足夠了？,"The correct answer is **C: 使用者主要重新路由 HTTP 流量**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that VPNs handle *all* network traffic, while proxies only handle HTTP traffic.**  This is the key distinction. If someone *only* needs to redirect web browsing (HTTP traffic), a proxy server is sufficient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 使用者想要重新路由所有流量:** The passage says VPNs are better for this, not proxies.
* **B: 使用者考慮盡可能避免審查和間諜活動:** The passage states VPNs are better for this due to their encryption and ability to handle all traffic.
* **D: 使用者的活動需要中等到高水平的頻寬:** The passage says VPNs *usually* offer higher bandwidth. Proxies are not generally known for high bandwidth.



"
根據這段文字，關於 VPN 和網路代理伺服器的說法中，以下何者為非？,"正確答案是 **D: VPN 只能重新路由 HTTP 流量**。

原因如下：

*   這段文字明確指出 VPN 能重新導向**所有**網路流量，而非僅限 HTTP 流量。因此，選項 D 是與文字內容相悖的。

其他選項都是文字中提到的正確資訊：

*   **A:** 文字提到 VPN 通常提供更高的頻寬。
*   **B:** 文字說明 VPN 重新導向所有流量，而代理伺服器僅重新導向 HTTP 流量。
*   **C:** 文字暗示 VPN 的服務品質通常優於網路代理伺服器。"
何者讓人們可以使用所在地區以外的電話公司？,"The correct answer is **A: 透過網際網路傳訊的通話**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""由於通話是透過網際網路傳訊的，不需要用到住處或到訪處的電話公司."" This directly answers the question. Internet-based messaging allows you to bypass traditional phone companies tied to your location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 國際電話號碼:** While mentioned in the passage, international phone numbers are *needed* when you *can't* use internet messaging and still want to receive PSTN calls. They don't *enable* you to use a phone company outside your region, they are a workaround.
* **C: 衛星:** Satellite internet allows connectivity *anywhere*, but it's the *internet messaging* aspect that lets you choose a different phone number/location.
* **D: PSTN 電話:** PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone system – it *requires* a local phone company and number and is exactly what the passage is saying you *avoid* with internet messaging.



"
根據這段文字，某些電話可能需要做什麼事情才可以接聽？,"The correct answer is **A: 購買國際電話號碼**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""常見的情況是必須購買不同的國際電話號碼，才能接到 PSTN 電話."" This directly answers the question of what some phones might need to do in order to receive calls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 使用本地電話公司** - The passage explicitly says this *isn't* necessary with internet-based communication.
*   **C: 擁有當地社區的電話號碼** -  The passage explains you *don't* need a local number.
*   **D: 購買 PSTN 手機** - The passage discusses needing a number *to receive* calls on a PSTN line, not needing a special phone."
關於義大利文單字發音的描述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 大多數單字的發音會根據其後的母音而定**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *most* words have a one-to-one spelling/pronunciation correspondence. It then specifically points out that letters *c* and *g* change pronunciation *based on the following vowel*, not that most words' pronunciation changes based on the following vowel. This is a subtle but important distinction. The passage highlights specific exceptions, not a general rule.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

*   **A: 雙 r 發音與單 r 發音不同** - The passage explicitly states this with the example of *care* vs. *carro*.
*   **B: 大多數單字的拼法與讀音一模一樣** - This is the first sentence of the passage.
*   **C: 有字母 c 和 g 的單字可能會很難** - The passage says to ""pay attention to the letters c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel."" This implies they can be difficult.



"
以下哪些伊茲密爾的特色源於現代之前？,"The correct answer is **D: 紅瓦屋頂 (Red tile roofs)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Traditional red tile roofs...are interspersed with broad boulevards, glass-curtained buildings, and modern shopping centers."" This clearly indicates the red tile roofs are a *traditional* feature, existing before the modern development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 寬闊的林蔭大道 (Broad boulevards)** - These are described as existing *alongside* traditional features, suggesting they are more recent.
*   **B: 玻璃帷幕大樓 (Glass-curtained buildings)** -  Explicitly described as part of the modern development.
*   **C: 購物中心 (Shopping centers)** - Also described as a modern feature.



"
關於伊茲密爾的特色，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 能反映傳統土耳其的氛圍 (Reflects a traditional Turkish atmosphere)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Izmir has a ""more Mediterranean European atmosphere"" *compared to* traditional Turkey. This means it doesn't strongly represent traditional Turkish culture.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: 城市環繞著一個大海灣 (The city is surrounded by a large bay):** The passage states Izmir is ""located on a vast bay.""
*   **C: 您可以找到現代購物中心和古老的教堂 (You can find modern shopping centers and ancient churches):** The passage mentions both ""modern shopping centers"" and ""ancient mosques and churches.""
*   **D: 它擁有土耳其第二大港口 (It has Turkey's second-largest port):** The passage states Izmir is ""the second-largest port after Istanbul."""
「花見」這個詞指的是觀賞什麼事物？,"The correct answer is **A: 櫻花**.

The passage states that ""花見"" (hanami) is another name for cherry blossom viewing (""賞櫻""). Therefore, ""花見"" refers to cherry blossoms (櫻花).
"
是誰舉辦了第一次專門賞櫻的派對？,"The correct answer is **C: 日本天皇 (Japanese Emperor)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom festivals were held by the Emperor for himself and other nobles around the Imperial Court.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 中國皇帝 (Chinese Emperor)** - The passage says the *idea* of flower viewing came from China, but it was *plum blossoms* they viewed, not cherry blossoms, and the first cherry blossom festivals were in Japan.
*   **B: 日本貴族 (Japanese Nobles)** - While nobles *attended* the earliest festivals, the Emperor *held* them.
*   **D: 中國貴族 (Chinese Nobles)** - Similar to A, this focuses on China where they admired plum blossoms, not cherry blossoms."
根據這段文字，耶路撒冷的以下哪個方面最不可能有觀光吸引力？,"The correct answer is **B: It as Israel's capital**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Jerusalem is Israel's capital and largest city, *although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as such*."" The text focuses on the *controversy* surrounding its capital status, not its appeal to tourists.
* **The passage *highlights* the other options as tourist attractions:**
    * **A: This city's religious significance:** The text directly says this is a major draw (""holy to three monotheistic religions... spiritual, religious and cultural center"").
    * **C: Its cultural products:** The passage mentions ""vibrant and bustling shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.""
    * **D: Numerous historical sites:** The text emphasizes its ""rich history"" and many ""historical, archaeological and cultural sites.""

Therefore, the fact that it's claimed as Israel's capital – something not universally recognized and potentially a sensitive topic – is the least likely aspect to be presented as a simple tourist attraction. It's more a point of political contention.



"
文中沒有提到以下何者為耶路撒冷聞名遐邇的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治影響**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **迷人的歷史 (A: Captivating history):** ""...擁有長達數千年的迷人歷史 (has a captivating history spanning thousands of years).""
    * **宗教意義 (C: Religious significance):** ""...是三種一神教──猶太教、基督教和伊斯蘭教的聖地 (is holy to the three monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).""
    * **文化遺址 (D: Cultural sites):** ""...擁有許多歷史、考古和文化景點 (has many historical, archaeological, and cultural sites).""

* **The passage *implies* political issues** (the dispute over its capital status), but it doesn't state that **政治影響 (political influence)** is a *reason Jerusalem is famous*. The passage focuses on history, religion, and culture as reasons for its renown.



"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅客不會因購買 Wild Card 而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 只參觀克魯格國家公園的旅客**.

Here's why:

The text states that a Wild Card is beneficial if you plan to visit *multiple* parks, either a selection or *all* of South Africa's national parks. If you only plan to visit Kruger National Park, the regular entry fee might be cheaper than purchasing the Wild Card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 打算盡可能多參訪幾處南非國家公園的旅客** - The text explicitly states the Wild Card is good for those visiting multiple parks.
*   **C: 擔心公園費用的窮遊旅客** - While the Wild Card has an upfront cost, it can *save* money on park fees overall, potentially benefiting budget travelers who visit several parks.
*   **D: 打算參觀克魯格國家公園和至少一個其他公園的旅客** - This scenario directly benefits from the Wild Card.



"
關於克魯格國家公園的描述，哪種說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是南非最小的國家公園**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Kruger National Park covers 19,000 square kilometers. This is a large area, and the text doesn't imply it's the smallest park.  In fact, its size is a notable feature.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: It is considered a major attraction in South Africa** - The passage explicitly states this.
* **B: The wildlife in the many eco-zones of the park varies** - The passage says it is ""divided into fourteen eco-zones, home to different plants and animals.""
* **D: Visitors can visit by purchasing a Wild Card** - The passage mentions the Wild Card as a potentially cost-effective option for park access.



"
對登山者來說，在整個山坡陡峭部分中，以下何者最有可能造成危險？,"The correct answer is **A: 潮濕情況**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...especially when wet, as this can quickly make things dangerous."" This directly links wet conditions to increased risk on the steeper parts of the trail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 石階 (Stone steps):** While steep, the steps are described as a feature of the trail, not a hazard in themselves.
* **C: 小洞穴 (Small cave):** The passage mentions it's *difficult* to get through, but not necessarily *dangerous* like a slippery slope.
* **D: 鋼纜 (Steel cables):** These are *provided* as a safety feature (handrails) to help with the steep sections.



"
以下哪種說法不能正確表達文中所述的馬丘比丘山的攀登？,"The correct answer is **B: 整個陡峭路段沒有扶手**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""大部分的步道都鋪設石階，地勢陡峭的路段則裝上鋼纜作為扶手"" (Most of the trail is paved with stone steps, and steel cables are installed as handrails on the steep sections.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 即使是健康的登山者也可能喘不過氣** (Even healthy climbers may gasp for breath) - The passage says ""要有喘不過氣的心理準備"" (Be prepared to gasp for breath).
* **C: 頂端有個必須穿越的小洞穴** (There's a small cave to crawl through at the top) - The passage states ""接近頂端的地方有個必須穿越的小洞穴"" (Near the top, there's a small cave to crawl through).
* **D: 較陡峭的部分在潮濕時會變得危險** (The steeper sections become dangerous when wet) -  The passage warns ""特別小心較陡的部份，尤其是潮濕的時候，因為這可能迅速使情況變得危險"" (Be especially careful of the steeper sections, especially when wet, as this can quickly make the situation dangerous).



"
根據這段文字，何者並非馬略卡島飲食的主食？,"正確答案是 **C: 穀物**。

這段文字明確指出馬略卡島飲食的主食是麵包、蔬菜和肉類（特別是豬肉），且普遍使用橄欖油。 雖然麵包是以穀物製成的，但文章中並未提及「穀物」本身是飲食的主食，而是強調「麵包」。

因此：

*   **A: 肉類** - 提到是主食之一。
*   **B: 麵包** - 提到是主食之一。
*   **D: 蔬菜** - 提到是主食之一。
*   **C: 穀物** - 雖然麵包是穀物製成的，但文章並未將穀物列為主食。"
根據文中資訊，關於地熱土窯美食的說法，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 在威靈頓也能吃到使用滾燙石頭的地熱土窯料理**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""在基督城、威靈頓和其他地方也能品嚐到其他土窯料理"" (In Christchurch, Wellington and other places you can also taste other *hangi* dishes).  It *doesn't* specify that Wellington has the traditional method using heated stones, just that they have *hangi* available.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A:** ""毛利杭吉美食是在地下的熱坑中烹煮。他們會用火燒過的滾燙石頭加熱坑洞"" (Maori *hangi* food is cooked in underground hot pits. They heat the pits with fire-burnt hot stones.)
* **C:** ""土窯常用於烹煮傳統烘烤式的晚餐"" (Earth ovens are often used to cook traditional roast meals.)
* **D:** ""在羅托魯瓦的幾個地方可以吃到地熱土窯料理"" (In several places in Rotorua you can eat geothermal *hangi* cuisine.)



"
典型的地熱土窯加熱方法中並未提及以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 天然氣 (Natural gas)**.

The passage explicitly mentions:

* **滾燙石頭 (Hot stones):** ""They heat the pits with fire-heated stones...""
* **地熱 (Geothermal activity):** ""...some places have geothermal activity, making the ground scalding hot.""

It doesn't mention the use of natural gas to heat the pits.

The option D: 滾燙石頭 is a duplicate of B, so it can't be the answer.
"
什麼可能會引起僧侶或尼姑的特別認可？,"The correct answer is **A: 穿著色彩鮮豔的裹巾**.

The passage specifically states: ""...if you have your own (especially a brightly colored one), the monks or nuns at the entrance will give you a smile."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 遮住你的肩膀** - This is a requirement, not something that earns special recognition.
* **C: 跟修道院借用裹巾** - Borrowing a wrap is offered as an option for those unprepared, but doesn't result in a smile. The passage even notes the borrowed wraps might be uncomfortable.
* **D: 穿著剪裁不及膝的裙子** - This is *against* the rules, not something that would be recognized positively."
從寺院不太可能借用以下哪件衣服？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 短褲**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states men must wear **long pants** that cover their knees, and women must wear **skirts** that go past the knee.
* It mentions skirts and wraps (shawls) are available to borrow.
* It *doesn't* mention short pants being available or acceptable. In fact, the rules clearly require knee coverage.

Therefore, it's unlikely you could borrow short pants from the monastery."
造訪南極地區時，遊客何時有機會看到星星？,"The correct answer is **C: 冬季 (Winter)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, meaning the sun does not rise above the horizon...you can also enjoy stargazing.""  Therefore, the opportunity to see stars is specifically linked to visiting during the *winter* when there's polar night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 夏季 (Summer):** The passage focuses on winter conditions.
*   **B: 人口稀少時 (When the population is sparse):** While true that sparse population reduces light pollution, this isn't *when* you have the opportunity, but *why* you have a better view.
*   **D: 光害程度較低時 (When the light pollution is lower):**  Similar to B, this explains *why* you see stars, not *when*.



"
衛星電話何時作為手機的替代品是行不通的？,"The correct answer is **A: If the line of sight to the satellite may be obstructed.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""You must be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call."" This means an obstructed view (like being indoors or surrounded by tall buildings/trees) will prevent the satellite phone from working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: If the location is too remote:** The passage *says* satellite phones are *used* in remote locations where cell service is unavailable.
* **C: If it is to be used outdoors:** The passage states you *must* be outdoors, but that's a requirement for use, not a reason it's not a substitute.
* **D: If the adventure requires certain data needs:** While the passage mentions adventures with data needs using satellite phones, it doesn't say it's a reason they *can't* be used as a substitute – it just implies they might need the service.



"
何時衛星電話比手機更妥當？,"The correct answer is **B: 在划船旅行期間 (During a boating trip)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""船舶（包括遊樂船和有遠端資料與音訊需求的探險船）時常使用這項服務"" (Ships, including recreational boats and expedition ships with remote data and audio needs, frequently use this service). This directly links satellite phones to boating situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在城市度假時 (During a city vacation):**  The passage states satellite phones are needed where *mobile signals aren't available*, which isn't typically the case in a city.
* **C: 不需要遠端資料時 (When remote data isn't needed):** The passage mentions expedition ships *with* remote data needs use satellite phones.
* **D: 您可能有合乎需要的手機訊號時 (When you might have a usable mobile signal):**  The entire point is satellite phones are for when mobile signals *aren't* available.



"
以下哪一項衝突促成了聶斯特河沿岸共和國的成立？,"The correct answer is **B: 種族**.

The passage explicitly states: ""摩爾多瓦是一個多種族的共和國，飽受種族衝突問題之苦。1994 年，這場衝突導致摩爾多瓦東部出現了一個自稱為聶斯特河沿岸共和國的國家。"" This directly links the formation of the breakaway region to ethnic conflict.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 經濟 (Economic):** While economic links have *re-established*, the passage doesn't say economic issues *caused* the conflict.
*   **C: 語言 (Language):** The passage mentions language differences (Romanian & Russian) but doesn't state this *caused* the conflict.
*   **D: 宗教 (Religion):** The passage mentions the dominant religion (Orthodox Christianity) but doesn't link it to the conflict."
聶斯特河沿岸共和國擁有以下何者與摩爾多瓦其他地區不同？  ,"The correct answer is **C: 聯合國的承認**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""聶斯特河沿岸共和國擁有自己的政府和貨幣，但並未獲得任何聯合國成員國的承認。"" (Transnistria has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member states.) This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 語言 (Language):** The passage mentions Moldavia uses both Romanian and Russian. It doesn't specify a different language situation in Transnistria.
* **B: 宗教 (Religion):** The passage states the main religion in Moldavia is Orthodox Christianity; it doesn't mention any religious differences in Transnistria.
* **D: 貨幣 (Currency):** The passage states Transnistria *has* its own currency, meaning it's different in that respect, but the question asks what Transnistria has that's *different* from the rest of Moldavia. Having a currency isn't unique to Transnistria in the context of the passage, the key difference is the *lack of recognition.*



"
根據這段文字，如果旅客希望避免大風的情況，他們應該何時到訪蒙特維多？,"The correct answer is **D: 蒙特維多的冬季**.

Here's why:

The text states that Montevideo's winters can be deceivingly cold *because of the wind*. The question asks about avoiding *wind*. Therefore, visiting during the winter (when the wind is a problem) is the opposite of what someone wanting to avoid wind would do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 北半球的冬季月份:** This is when it's *summer* in Montevideo, and the text focuses on wind being an issue in winter.
*   **B: 蒙特維多的旱季:** The text states there is no distinct dry season.
*   **C: 北半球的夏季月份:** This is when it's *winter* in Montevideo, and the text mentions the wind being an issue then.



"
根據這段文字，如果旅客偏愛涼爽的氣候，他們應該何時到訪蒙特維多？,"The correct answer is **D: 北半球的冬季**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""由於蒙特維多位於赤道以南，因此當北半球冬季時，那裡是夏季，反之亦然。"" (Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa).
* **The question asks:** When should a traveler visit if they *prefer a cool climate*?
* Therefore, they should visit when it's winter *in Montevideo*, which is during the **Northern Hemisphere's winter**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 蒙特維多的夏季 (Montevideo's summer):** The passage states summers are often over 30 degrees Celsius - too hot for someone wanting a cool climate.
* **B: 北半球的夏季 (Northern Hemisphere's summer):** This would be winter in Montevideo, and therefore not a cool climate.
* **C: 蒙特維多的雨季 (Montevideo's rainy season):** The passage says there isn't a specific rainy season, and even if there were, it doesn't necessarily correlate with cooler temperatures.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者與知名的塗鴉藝術家有關，而不是蓄意破壞？,"The correct answer is **A: 塗鴉活動 (Graffiti events)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""現今已有很多知名的塗鴉藝術家、塗鴉活動和「合法」塗鴉牆."" This directly links graffiti events with well-known artists and implies they are a more positive, artistic aspect of graffiti.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: 潦草字跡 (Scribbles)** - The passage contrasts these with the work of known artists.
    * **C: 擅自在公共財產上加上的壁畫 (Unauthorized murals on public property)** - The passage initially describes graffiti *as* vandalism, which is the opposite of what the question asks for.
    * **D: 難以辨別的標誌 (Indistinguishable markings)** -  The passage specifically states that the work of known artists is *not* like these markings.

Therefore, graffiti events are the only option that's explicitly connected to respected graffiti artists and a move away from destructive behavior.
"
部分參加音樂節的遊客認為音樂節哪些方面是體驗的重要環節？,"The correct answer is **B: 現場露營 (Camping on-site)**.

The passage states: ""參加音樂節的大部分遊客都會選擇在現場露營，而且他們大多認為這是體驗的重要環節。"" (Most visitors to music festivals choose to camp on-site, and they mostly consider this an important part of the experience.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 帶上幼童 (Bringing young children):** The passage *mentions* family camping areas, but doesn't say bringing children is a core part of the experience for *most* visitors.
*   **C: 持續到深夜的音樂表演 (Music performances that continue late into the night):** While the passage notes performances go late, it doesn't frame this as a central aspect of the experience for *most* attendees.
*   **D: 提早進場 (Entering early):** The passage says you need to enter early for a good camping spot, but early entry isn't the core experience itself; it's a means to an end (getting a good camping location).



"
根據這段文字，如果參加音樂節的遊客想在音樂附近露營，他們應該優先考慮什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 提早進場 (Arrive early)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""If you want to view the activities up close, you must go in early and find a camping spot near the music performance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 深夜前往 (Go late at night):** The text suggests the opposite – you need to arrive *early* to get a good spot.
*   **B: 住在家庭專屬的露營區 (Stay in the family-only camping area):** While the text mentions family areas, it doesn't say this is the priority for those wanting to be near the music.
*   **C: 場外露營 (Camp outside the venue):** The text focuses on camping *at* the venue, specifically near the music."
根據這段文字，在新墨西哥州北部尋找夜生活時，遊客應該避開哪裡？,"The correct answer is **B: 小鎮酒吧**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""提醒您：這兒的小鎮酒吧並非總適合外州來的遊客閒逛."" It then explains *why* they aren't suitable (due to drunk driving risks).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 小鎮:** While the text implies night life is limited in small towns, it doesn't say to *avoid* them entirely.
*   **C: 商場:** The text doesn't mention shopping malls at all.
*   **D: 賭場:** The text actually suggests casinos *are* a good place to find nightlife (drinks and entertainment).



"
根據這段文字，在新墨西哥州北部，遊客最有可能在哪裡找到知名娛樂場所？,"The correct answer is **C: 聖塔菲附近的賭場**.

Here's why:

The text states ""其中的幾個賭場亦會請來知名的娛樂表演（主要是阿爾伯克基和聖塔菲周遭鄰近的較大賭場）"". This directly indicates that larger casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe are where you'll find well-known entertainment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 距離阿布奎基兩小時車程的賭場:** While some casinos might be two hours from Albuquerque, the text specifically highlights casinos *near* both Albuquerque *and* Santa Fe.
*   **B: 一個偏遠小鎮:** The text explicitly states that most Indian villages (which are likely remote small towns) don't have much nightlife.
*   **D: 小鎮酒吧:** The text warns that small-town bars aren't always suitable for out-of-state visitors and also mentions the danger of drunk driving in those areas.



"
精打細算的旅客可能想避開哪種類型的飲料？,"The correct answer is **D: 果汁**.

The passage states: ""果汁很貴，但非常好喝。"" (Juice is expensive, but very good.)

This implies that juice is not a good option for budget-conscious travellers. The other options are either relatively affordable (local beer, tap water) or a matter of preference (Australian wine - the passage only says they travel well, not that they're expensive).
"
根據文中所述的區域，服務生可能會弄混以下哪張飲料訂單？,"The correct answer is **D: 白咖啡**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""白咖啡"" (white coffee) is a foreign concept to people in the region (specifically Australians). This implies that a local server might not be familiar with it and could easily mistake the order for something else.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: 濃縮咖啡 (Espresso):** The passage states ""濃縮咖啡是「espresso」"", meaning it's a well-understood term.
*   **B: 第一 (First):** This is described as the main local beer, so a server would definitely know what it is.
*   **C: 紐西蘭的白蘇維濃 (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc):** New Zealand wine is mentioned as being able to withstand travel, suggesting it's available and likely known to servers.

"
長達三個世紀的殖民時期是由哪個群體開始的？,"The correct answer is **D: 西班牙人**.

The text states: ""西班牙人開始了長達三個世紀的殖民時期."" (Spaniards began a three-century period of colonization.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 帕亞瓜原住民** - The text says they lived in the Chaco region and subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing, but doesn't mention them starting colonization.
*   **B: 瓜庫魯原住民** - Similar to the Payagua, they were inhabitants of the Chaco region, not colonizers.
*   **C: 瓜拉尼人** - The text states they were the most important indigenous people in eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle, but doesn't say they started colonization."
根據這段文字，讓巴黎人對你感興趣的最佳方式是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 舉止有禮貌 (Behave politely)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that demonstrating ""basic politeness"" will cause the ""apparent rudeness"" of Parisians to quickly disappear. It highlights the importance of appearing ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered) to get along well in Paris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 試圖模仿巴黎人的態度 (Try to imitate Parisian attitudes):** The passage *challenges* the negative stereotypes about Parisians, suggesting imitation isn't the solution.
*   **B: 散發自信 (Exude confidence):** While confidence can be helpful, the passage focuses specifically on politeness.
*   **D: 展現外向行為 (Display outgoing behavior):** The passage doesn't mention outgoing behavior as a key to interacting successfully with Parisians.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者不被認為是巴黎人的刻板印象？,"The correct answer is **C: 俏皮 (playful)**.

The passage explicitly states that Parisians have a reputation for being ""self-centered, rude, and arrogant."" ""Rude"" is also described as ""brusque"" (唐突) which is option D.  The passage *doesn't* mention anything about Parisians being considered playful.

Therefore, **俏皮 (playful)** is the characteristic *not* presented as a stereotype of Parisians in the text."
開普敦 MetroRail 通勤鐵路頭等艙有什麼好處？,"The correct answer is **B: 人沒有那麼多**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that MetroPlus (first class) is ""more comfortable and less crowded.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 車廂在列車的前端** - The passage specifically states MetroPlus cars are at the *rear* of the train, closest to Cape Town.
*   **C: 比三等艙票價便宜** - The passage states MetroPlus is ""slightly more expensive.""
*   **D: 與三等艙票價相同** - The passage states MetroPlus is ""slightly more expensive."""
根據這段文字，開普敦的每班通勤列車都有什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 頭等艙和三等艙車廂**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""All trains have both MetroPlus and Metro carriages.""  MetroPlus is referred to as first class and Metro as third class.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 較不擁擠的三等艙車廂** - The text states MetroPlus (first class) is less crowded, not Metro (third class).
*   **B: 兩種艙等的票價相同** - The text says MetroPlus is *slightly more expensive*.
*   **C: 不同的三種艙等** - The text only mentions two classes: MetroPlus and Metro."
動物害蟲不太可能做到以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 造成藉力傷害**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""傳染病本身，或藉力傷害或殺害人的危險動物，通常不屬於害蟲。"" (Diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that harm or kill people, are generally not considered pests.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 造成皮疹 (Cause a rash):** The passage states pests can cause discomfort, and rashes are a form of discomfort/allergic reaction.
*   **B: 刺激過敏反應 (Trigger an allergic reaction):** The passage explicitly mentions pests can cause allergic reactions.
*   **C: 傳播傳染病 (Spread infectious diseases):** The passage explicitly mentions pests can spread infectious diseases.

Therefore, causing *intentional* harm (藉力傷害) is something pests are *not* likely to do, as that puts them into the category of dangerous animals, which are excluded from the definition of ""pest"" in the passage."
哪裡可以購買預付電話卡？,"The correct answer is **C: 雜貨店 (Grocery stores)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""每一間雜貨店都有販售預付電話卡"" (Every grocery store sells prepaid phone cards).

The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
如何取得通話費率更優惠的某些預付卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過撥打免付費電話**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""通常可以透過撥打一支免付費電話號碼來取得這些服務..."" This directly answers the question of how to get the better rates offered by some prepaid cards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它們只能在特定國家取得 (They are only available in certain countries)** - The passage doesn't say the *cards* are only available in certain countries, only that some offer cheaper rates *to* certain countries.
* **C: 雜貨店 (Grocery stores)** - While you *buy* the cards at grocery stores, that doesn't explain how to get the better rates.
* **D: 使用公用電話並支付額外費用 (Using a payphone and paying extra)** - The passage doesn't mention payphones.



"
根據這段文字，在十六湖國家公園不太常見到以下哪棵樹？,"The correct answer is **B: 橡樹**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the park is primarily characterized by **beech (山毛櫸), spruce (雲杉), and fir (樅樹)** trees. It doesn't mention oak trees at all. The text emphasizes the *absence* of a wide variety of trees, specifically naming the dominant ones. Therefore, oak trees would be the least common.
"
以下哪些稀有動物可以在十六湖國家公園找到？,"The correct answer is **D: 松雞**.

The text specifically mentions ""松雞 (capercaillie)"" as a rare animal found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. 

The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
根據這段文字，區域碼實際上能幫助什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 掌控市場**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the *actual* purpose of region codes is to allow companies to ""better control their markets"" and that ""it's all about making money.""  The passage directly contradicts the claim that region codes prevent piracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 光碟複製 (Disc copying):** The passage says bit-for-bit copies work perfectly, so region codes don't *help* copying.
* **C: 防止盜版 (Preventing Piracy):** The passage directly states region codes *do not* prevent piracy.
* **D: 非法複製 (Illegal copying):** Similar to A, the passage states copies work as well as originals, so region codes aren't helpful in preventing this.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者是媒體公司以區域碼繼續編造的謊言？,"The correct answer is **B: 區域碼有助於避免非法複製**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""媒體公司經常的在此舉的目的上說謊，聲稱這是為了「防止盜版」."" and then immediately counters that claim with ""實際上，區域碼完全無法防止盜版"". This means the *lie* they are telling is that region codes *help* to prevent piracy/illegal copying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 區域碼是更能掌控他們市場的必要措施** - The passage states this *is* the actual purpose, not a lie.
*   **C: 區域碼對吸金很有用** - The passage states this is the actual purpose (""一切都是為了賺錢""), not a lie.
*   **D: 區域碼對防止盜版幾乎沒有幫助** - The passage states this is the truth, not a lie being told by the companies.



"
回國時，何者通常是非正規程序？,"The correct answer is **A: 移民署檢查**.

Here's why:

The passage states that you *might not* go through immigration checks, or it might be a formality. This implies it's not always a standard, necessary step.  The passage *emphasizes* the importance of understanding and complying with customs regulations (海關控管), suggesting that's a routine and potentially strict part of returning home.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 申報物品 (Declaring items)** - The passage explicitly states you *must* declare items if you exceed limits, making it a standard procedure.
* **C: 物品的法律規定 (Legal regulations of items)** - These regulations exist regardless of whether you're checked, so they are not a question of being a ""non-standard"" procedure.
* **D: 海關管制 (Customs control)** - The passage points to this as potentially being a very thorough and even ""troublesome"" part of the process, indicating it's a standard procedure, not a non-standard one.



"
回國時，您應該瞭解以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 是否需要申報超出法律規定的物品 (Whether you need to declare items exceeding legal limits)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""一定要要知道可攜帶及不可攜帶的物品種類，若攜帶超出規定數量必須詳實申報。"" (You must know what you can and cannot bring, and if you carry more than the allowed quantity, you must truthfully declare it.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 是否有移民署檢查站 (Whether there is an immigration checkpoint):** The passage says immigration checks *might* be minimal or non-existent, so knowing if there *is* one isn't the primary takeaway.
* **C: 是否有海關管制 (Whether there is customs control):** While the passage mentions customs control being potentially strict, the *focus* is on knowing *what* you can bring and declaring anything over the limit.  Knowing there *is* control isn't as important as knowing the rules.
* **D: 是否攜帶任何違禁品 (Whether you are carrying any prohibited items):**  Knowing not to carry prohibited items is implied, but the passage specifically emphasizes *quantity limits* and *declaration* rather than simply avoiding prohibited items (which should be common sense).

Therefore, understanding the rules for declaration is the most important thing the passage highlights."
根據這段文字，科查莫谷具備豐富的什麼東西讓登山者不斷探索其內部的新路線？,"The correct answer is **D: 岩壁 (Rock walls)**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""...擁有各式各樣的大片花崗岩壁和峭壁 (has a variety of large granite walls and cliffs)...世界各地的攀岩者持續在**潛力無窮的岩壁**上開創新的路線 (climbers around the world continue to pioneer new routes on the **promising rock walls**).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 美景 (Beautiful scenery)** – While the text mentions breathtaking views *from* the summits, it's the rock formations themselves that attract climbers and encourage exploration.
* **B: 頂峰 (Peaks/Summits)** – The summits offer views, but it's the climbing *to* those summits that is highlighted, and that's done on the rock walls.
* **C: 山頂 (Mountain tops)** – Similar to ""頂峰"", this refers to the destination, not the feature enabling exploration.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，誰涵蓋了南半球最多的越洋航線？,"The correct answer is **B: 星空聯盟**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""星空聯盟涵蓋了所有航線，除了南太平洋東部從智利聖地牙哥到大溪地的航線以外..."" This means Star Alliance covers the most routes across the Southern Hemisphere's oceans, with only one exception operated by a different alliance (Oneworld).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 天合聯盟 (SkyTeam):** The text specifically states that SkyTeam doesn't cross any ocean in the Southern Hemisphere.
*   **C: 南太平洋 (South Pacific):** This is a geographic location, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: 寰宇一家 (Oneworld):** Oneworld only operates *one* specific route (Santiago to Tahiti) in the Southern Hemisphere, and is not the most comprehensive."
哪個航空聯盟涵蓋最少的南半球越洋航線？,"The correct answer is **D: 天合聯盟**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""天合聯盟未橫跨任一海洋"" (Star Alliance does not cross any ocean). This means they cover the fewest South Hemisphere oceanic routes. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 星空聯盟:** The passage says they cover *all* routes except one, making them quite comprehensive.
*   **B: 南太平洋:** This is a geographical location, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: 寰宇一家:** The passage states that they operate the one route Star Alliance doesn't, indicating they have significant coverage.



"
哪個旅遊組織接續了全球跑步之旅？,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The text explicitly states: ""Go Running Tours 接續 Global Running Tours..."" which translates to ""Go Running Tours followed Global Running Tours..."".

The other options are all individual running tour locations *within* the network built by Go Running Tours, not the organization that followed Global Running Tours.
"
根據這段文字，Go Running Tours 協助串連了多少個不同的觀光路跑供應商？,"The correct answer is **C: 數十個 (dozens)**.

The text states: ""Go Running Tours 接續 Global Running Tours 成立，在四大洲串連了**數十個**觀光路跑供應商。"" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 四個 (four)** - While the text mentions Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague, it also says ""數十個"" (dozens) were connected, indicating more than just three.
* **B: 200 個 (200)** - The text states there are *nearly 200* running tour organizations *in general*, not that Go Running Tours connected 200 suppliers.
* **D: 三個 (three)** - Again, only mentions three specific locations, but states “數十個” were connected.



"
如果遊客希望盡可能清楚地看到獵豹，該怎麼做？,"The correct answer is **C: 使用雙筒望遠鏡 (Use binoculars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""獅子、獵豹和花豹有時會害怕人靠近，比較適合用雙筒望遠鏡來觀察。"" (Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes afraid of people and are best observed with binoculars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 去野生健行 (Go on a wildlife walk)** - The passage implies cheetahs would be *more* scared during a walk.
*   **B: 去叢林漫步 (Go on a jungle walk)** -  Same reason as A.
*   **D: 搭車並使用標準裝備 (Ride in a car and use standard equipment)** - Standard equipment is good for elephants and giraffes, which *approach* vehicles. Cheetahs are described as being scared of people.



"
根據這段文字，遊客在坐車遊覽野生動物園時可能會遇到哪種動物？,"The correct answer is **B: 長頸鹿 (Giraffe)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""大象和長頸鹿這些動物往往會接近車子，因此標準裝備能讓你看得更清楚。"" (Elephants and giraffes often approach vehicles, so standard equipment will allow you to see them more clearly.)

The text specifically mentions giraffes as animals that *will* approach the vehicle. While lions, leopards, and cheetahs are mentioned, they are described as being *afraid* of people and better viewed with binoculars, implying they *won't* be approaching the vehicle.
"
根據這段文字，什麼事情會降低旅遊成本？,"The correct answer is **B: 尋找四人團 (Finding a group of four)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""越多人的旅行團價格越便宜…可以與其他人結伴組成四到六人的團體，以降低個人單價。"" (The more people in a tour group, the cheaper the price...you can join with others to form a group of four to six people to lower the individual cost.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 單獨旅遊 (Traveling alone):** The passage implies this would be *more* expensive, not less.
* **C: 和另一個人一起去 (Going with another person):** While better than solo travel, it doesn't reach the optimal cost savings of a 4-6 person group.
* **D: 尋找六人或六人以上的團體 (Finding a group of six or more):** While larger groups are cheaper, the passage specifically highlights forming a group of *four to six* as a good strategy.



"
根據這段文字，誰有可能獲得最棒的旅遊價格？,"The correct answer is **A: 四處詢問以加入旅行團的遊客**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""越多人的旅行團價格越便宜...通常都會有許多旅客四處詢問加入旅行團。"" This directly implies that those actively seeking to join groups will benefit from the lower prices offered to larger groups.
* **Other options are less ideal:**
    * **B: 三人團** - While better than two, it's not the *most* beneficial.
    * **C: 兩個朋友一起旅行** - The passage suggests this will be *more* expensive than joining a larger group.
    * **D: 五人團** - While a good size, the passage focuses on *finding* these groups, not necessarily forming them.  The benefit comes from leveraging existing groups.

The passage even hints at a potential ""scam"" where individuals are led to believe they must pay more, further emphasizing the advantage of finding and joining existing larger groups.
"
根據這段文字，是什麼讓舊金山得以聞名全球？,"The correct answer is **A: 經常出現在各種形式的藝術和媒體中**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""音樂、電影、文學和流行文化中的頻繁描述使這座城市及其地標變得舉世聞名。"" This directly explains that the city's fame comes from its depiction in art and media.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 一流的會議設施** - While mentioned, this is a *result* of the tourism and doesn't explain *why* the city is globally known.
* **C: 多元的經濟活動** - The passage states the economy is diverse, but doesn't say this is what makes it famous.
* **D: 嶄露頭角的亞洲美食界** - This is just one aspect of the city and doesn't explain its overall global recognition.



"
根據這段文字，關於舊金山的說法中，以下何者為非？,"正確答案是 **D: 經濟完全仰仗旅遊業**。

這段文字明確指出，舊金山的經濟*雖然*與觀光息息相關，但實際上經濟活動非常*多元*。 就業人口最多的領域並非只有觀光業，還包括專業服務、公家機關、金融和貿易等。

其他選項：

*   **A: 它經常出現在電影和書籍中** - 文本確實提到這點，說舊金山因在音樂、電影、文學等領域的頻繁描述而聞名。
*   **B: 亞洲美食很普遍** - 文本也提到舊金山是品嘗亞洲料理的好去處。
*   **C: 有許多飯店和會議中心** - 文本指出舊金山發展了大規模的觀光基礎建設，包括飯店和一流的會議設施。

"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅客不太可能因使用旅行社服務而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 傾向於隨興安排的旅客**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the benefits of pre-booking and having things arranged in advance.** This includes knowing you have accommodation upon arrival, pre-arranged transportation, and the ability to hold reservations while gathering documents.
* **Travel agencies provide structure and planning.** Someone who prefers to be spontaneous and doesn't like pre-arranged plans wouldn't benefit from this. They'd likely prefer to book things as they go.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 優柔寡斷的旅客 (Indecisive travelers):** The passage states travel agencies can *hold* reservations while you consider options. This is helpful for indecisive travelers.
* **C: 還未確定拿到簽證的旅客 (Travelers who haven't secured a visa yet):**  The passage specifically mentions travel agencies can hold reservations while you gather documents like visas.
* **D: 喜歡預訂套裝行程的旅客 (Travelers who like package deals):** The passage highlights that travel agencies *offer* package deals, making them a good fit for these travelers.



"
文中沒有提到以下何者為經由旅行社預訂的好處？,"The correct answer is **A: 旅行證件急件處理 (Expedited travel documents)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **飯店優惠 (Hotel discounts):** It states travel agencies often work with specific hotels.
    * **全包套裝行程 (All-inclusive packages):** It explicitly says packages often include breakfast, airport transfers, and flights/hotels.
    * **保留預訂 (Holding reservations):** It states they can hold reservations while you consider or gather documents.

* **The passage *does not* mention:**
    * **旅行證件急件處理 (Expedited travel documents):** While they mention helping with documents like visas, they don't offer to *expedite* them.

Therefore, A is the only option not discussed in the text."
根據這段文字，即時文本翻譯應用程式不能做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 每次都 100% 正確翻譯**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...translation results can still be completely wrong, so should be treated with some caution."" This means the apps *don't* always translate correctly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 將標誌翻譯成外語** - The text states these apps *can* translate text on signs.
*   **B: 翻譯整段文本** - The text defines these apps as translating ""whole paragraphs of text"".
*   **C: 透過智慧型手機翻譯物件上的文本** - The text explicitly mentions translating text on objects by pointing a smartphone at them.

Therefore, the only thing the app *cannot* guarantee is 100% accuracy.
"
何者讓翻譯可以離線進行？,"The correct answer is **C: 下載語言資料 (Downloading language data)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Google 翻譯，它可以在**下載所需的語言資料後**，進行離線翻譯.""  This directly links the ability to translate offline to downloading the necessary language files.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 改進的翻譯引擎 (Improved translation engine):** While a better engine provides more *accurate* translations, it doesn't enable offline translation on its own.
*   **B: 智慧型手機 (Smartphone):** A smartphone is the device used, but it doesn't *allow* offline translation.
*   **D: 即時翻譯類別的應用程式 (Instant translation category of applications):** This is a general description of the app type, not the specific mechanism for offline use.



"
以下何者並非觸發雪崩的因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 有黏性的雪 (Sticky snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that snow *has* viscosity (stickiness) and that this viscosity is *why* a trigger is needed for an avalanche to occur.  Sticky snow is a condition that *prevents* avalanches until something else happens, it doesn't *cause* them.

The passage lists the following as triggers:

*   Sunlight (太陽使雪升溫)
*   More snow (下了更多雪)
*   Other natural events (其它自然事件)
*   Humans (人為)

Therefore, sticky snow is the only option that isn't a trigger."
根據這段文字，以下何者掉下會形成雪崩？,"The correct answer is **C: 陡坡上多餘的積雪**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""陡峭斜坡能累積的雪量有限，多餘的積雪會掉下形成雪崩。"" This directly links excess snow on steep slopes to avalanches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 未觸發的有黏性的雪 (Untriggered sticky snow)** - The text explains that snow *needs* a trigger to slide, so untriggered snow won't cause an avalanche on its own. The stickiness is what *prevents* it from sliding easily.
* **B: 沒有雪的陡峭斜坡 (Steep slope with no snow)** -  No snow means no avalanche.
* **D: 人類沒碰過的雪 (Snow untouched by humans)** - While the text mentions humans *can* trigger avalanches, it also says natural events can. So, snow that hasn't been touched by humans isn't necessarily safe from avalanches. The key is the *excess* snow and a trigger, not whether a human was involved.



"
根據這段文字，咖哩以哪些食材為底？,"The correct answer is **B: 藥草和香料 (herbs and spices)**.

The text explicitly states: ""咖哩是以**藥草和香料**為底，加上肉類或蔬菜的菜餚。"" (Curry is based on **herbs and spices**, plus meat or vegetables.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 優格和水 (yogurt and water)** - Yogurt is *used in some* curries, but isn't the base. Water isn't specifically mentioned as a base.
*   **C: 椰奶和肉類 (coconut milk and meat)** - Coconut milk is used in *some* curries, and meat is an addition, not the base.
*   **D: 蔬菜和牛奶 (vegetables and milk)** - Vegetables are an addition, and milk isn't mentioned as a base ingredient."
在某些地區，有時咖哩中的哪種食材會使用椰奶代替？,"The correct answer is **C: 優格**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""南印度和印度次大陸的其他沿海地區則常改用椰奶"" (South India and other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent often use coconut milk instead)... and previously mentions that ""巴基斯坦和北印度內陸區的咖哩料理中常用到優格"" (Yogurt is commonly used in Pakistani and inland North Indian curries). This indicates that coconut milk is often used *instead of* yogurt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 肉類 (Meat)** - The passage doesn't say meat is ever replaced with coconut milk.
*   **B: 蔬菜 (Vegetables)** - The passage doesn't say vegetables are ever replaced with coconut milk.
*   **D: 香料 (Spices)** - The passage states spices are a *base* of curry, not something that is replaced."
為什麼沿著橫貫南極山脈繞彎路才能抵達高原上方？,"The correct answer is **C: 專用拖拉機不靈活**.

The passage specifically states: ""它們不太靈活，所以路徑必須沿著橫貫南極山脈繞著長長的彎路才能抵達高原上方。"" This directly links the inflexibility of the tractors to the need to go around the mountains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 麥克默多站經常關閉** - The passage doesn't mention the closure of McMurdo Station.
* **B: 壓實的雪地很危險** - While Antarctica is dangerous, the passage highlights the road is *made* of compacted snow and crevasses are *filled*, making it traversable.
* **D: 這樣比穿越羅斯海更容易** - The passage doesn’t compare routes and focuses on the necessity of the winding path due to the vehicle’s limitations.



"
在南極橫貫公路上，什麼東西用旗幟作記號了？,"The correct answer is **C: 用雪填補過的裂縫**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""...有旗幟作為記號"" directly after mentioning that the road has had cracks filled in (""裂縫也經過填補""). This strongly implies the flags mark the filled-in cracks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 麥克默多站的小徑 (The path from McMurdo Station)** - The passage talks about the road *to* McMurdo Station, not a path *from* it.
*   **B: 運輸燃油的拖拉機 (The tractors transporting fuel)** - The tractors *use* the road, they aren't marked by flags.
*   **D: 危險的繞山彎路 (Dangerous winding paths)** - While the road winds, the passage doesn't say flags mark the bends themselves.



"
文中沒有提到遊客在探索南非時應該注意什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 幾乎所有南非鄰國都很穩定**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""規劃時請牢記在心，南非雖然安定，但並非所有鄰國都如此。"" (Keep in mind when planning that while South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 簽證要求因國家而異** - The passage *does* mention visa requirements vary.
* **B: 開車探索是參觀人跡罕至之地的好方法** - The passage *does* state that driving allows access to less-traveled areas.
* **D: 如果開車旅行，建議使用四輪傳動車** - The passage *does* strongly recommend a 4x4 vehicle.

Therefore, the only thing the passage *doesn't* say is that South Africa's neighbors are all stable. It explicitly points out the opposite.
"
根據這段文字，對於希望駕車探索南非的遊客來說，何者會被視為不好的建議？,"The correct answer is **B: 雖然建議使用四輪傳動車，但大多數地點都可以用普通車輛到達.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while a regular car *can* be used with careful planning, a 4x4 is *strongly recommended* and many places are only accessible with a high-clearance 4x4. This contradicts the statement that most places can be reached with a regular car.

Let's look at why the other options are good advice, according to the text:

*   **A: 應法律要求，可能會需要在車內放置某些緊急物品:** The text says each country has laws requiring certain emergency items in the car.
*   **C: 開車旅行非常適合那些希望偏離典型旅遊路線的旅客:** The passage starts by saying driving allows you to see sights off the beaten path.
*   **D: 並非所有南非鄰國都是理想的旅遊目的地:** The text warns that South Africa is stable, but not all its neighbors are.



"
文中沒有提到以下何者為行李無人看管的潛在危險？,"The correct answer is **C: 可能會與別人的行李混淆 (May be confused with someone else's luggage)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:**
    *   行李無人看管會成為竊賊的目標 (Luggage left unattended is a target for thieves). - This matches option A.
    *   您可能會在不知不覺中成為攜帶毒品者 (You could unknowingly become a drug mule). - This matches option B.
    *   可能引起提防炸彈威脅的相關單位注意 (May attract the attention of authorities concerned about bomb threats). - This matches option D.

*   **The passage does NOT mention** anything about luggage being confused with someone else's. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
關於攜帶毒品，文中沒有提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 即使沒有攜帶毒品，當局也可能會沒收您的行李.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the danger of unknowingly becoming a drug mule and the importance of keeping your luggage in sight to avoid that.** It warns about potential consequences if drugs are found in your luggage, even if you didn't put them there.
* **Option A** is directly stated in the text (""有些國家就算對初犯也有嚴重的刑罰，包含 ... 死刑"").
* **Option B** is a central theme - the passage is *all* about extra precautions during international travel.
* **Option C** is also directly stated (""緝毒犬可以在不另行通知的情況下，隨時查驗"").
* **Option D** is *not* mentioned. The passage talks about luggage being searched for drugs or stolen, but not about being confiscated simply without cause.

Therefore, the passage does not mention the possibility of authorities confiscating luggage even without finding drugs.
"
居家度假時，文中沒有提到哪種飲料可以嘗試在家製作？,"The correct answer is **C: 啤酒 (Beer)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **Coffee:** ""早晨讓家裡充盈濃郁的咖啡香"" (Fill your home with the rich aroma of coffee in the morning)
    * **洋甘菊茶 (Chamomile tea):** ""夜間則來點放鬆身心的洋甘菊茶"" (Enjoy relaxing chamomile tea in the evening)
    * **果汁/果昔 (Juice/Smoothies):** ""把握機會榨果汁或打一些果昔"" (Take the opportunity to juice or make smoothies)
* **The passage mentions exploring bars/pubs** with various drinking cultures, implying alcohol, but does *not* suggest making beer at home.

Therefore, beer is the only option not explicitly mentioned as something to try making at home."
如果你的城市以飲酒文化聞名，你應該於居家度假期間到訪以下何者？,"The correct answer is **C: 你通常不常光顧的酒吧**.

The passage specifically states: ""If you live in a city with a vibrant drinking culture, you should visit bars or pubs you don’t usually go to.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 鄰近的咖啡店** - The passage mentions coffee for mornings, but not as a destination during a staycation in a city known for drinking culture.
* **B: 果汁或冰沙店** - The passage suggests making juice/smoothies *at home* if you're adventurous, not going to a store.
* **D: 沖泡洋甘菊茶的餐廳** - The passage suggests drinking chamomile tea for relaxation *at home*, not going to a restaurant for it.



"
鴿子雕像在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **B: 墓地裡 (in the graveyard)**.

The text states: ""In the churchyard, some gravestones have interesting marble sculptures of pigeons.""  A churchyard is another word for a graveyard or cemetery.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 距離村莊半小時的路程 (Half an hour from the village)** - The text says spending *time in* the village is worthwhile, not that the sculptures are a half-hour *away*.
* **C: 在東島上 (On East Island)** - The text mentions East Island as a view *from* the village, not where the sculptures are.
* **D: 教堂內 (Inside the church)** - The text specifically states they are in the *churchyard* (outside), on the gravestones.
"
哪種類型的簽證可能需要某人提供足夠的財力證明？,"The correct answer is **D: 學生簽證**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...學生簽證的要求和申請程序通常與一般觀光或商務簽證不同...在大部分的國家/地區，您都要提供...至少能支持您完成第一年課程的財力證明."" 

This directly links the need for financial proof to student visas. The other options (business, tourist, short-term) are not mentioned as requiring this in the passage.



"
誰最有可能需要延長簽證？,"The correct answer is **C: 國際學生 (International students)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""學生簽證的要求和申請程序通常與一般觀光或商務簽證不同...學生簽證的要求...通常比觀光客更長。"" This directly links the need for visas and potentially extensions to international students due to their longer stays.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 觀光常客 (Frequent tourists):** The passage says short stays for tourism *may not* require visas.
* **B: 經驗豐富的旅客 (Experienced travelers):** Experience doesn't change the visa requirements based on the length of stay.
* **D: 商務旅客 (Business travelers):** The passage mentions business visas, but doesn't suggest they are more likely to need extensions than students.



"
何時應該特別注意蚊子？,"The best answer is **C: 熱帶雨林中**. 

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states mosquitoes are a concern ""if you decide to hike through a rainforest"" and ""even when driving through a subtropical rainforest.""**  It emphasizes the risk is present *in the rainforest environment* regardless of how you're traveling.
* **A: 夏季 (Summer)** is mentioned, but it's presented as a time when the problem is *worse*, not the primary location of the problem.
* **B: 徒步旅行時 (When hiking)** is one specific situation mentioned, but the passage also includes driving.
* **D: 開車時 (When driving)** is also a specific situation, and the passage clarifies the danger isn't *during* driving, but when entering/exiting the vehicle in the rainforest.

Therefore, the overarching location where you should be particularly aware of mosquitoes is **熱帶雨林中 (in the rainforest)**."
根據這段文字，開車穿越熱帶雨林時，為了避開蚊子，你不應該做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 讓車門打開的時間過長 (Let the car door stay open for too long)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that even a few seconds with the car door open is enough for mosquitoes to enter. This directly implies you should minimize the time the door is open.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 夏季開車穿越熱帶雨林 (Driving through a tropical rainforest in the summer):** The passage acknowledges mosquitoes are particularly bad in summer, but doesn't say you *shouldn't* drive then, just that you need to be careful.
* **C: 駕車穿越亞熱帶地區 (Driving through a subtropical area):** The passage mentions *亞熱帶* rain forests specifically, so driving through them isn't the problem, it's the mosquitoes.
* **D: 徒步旅行時無人看管車輛 (Leaving the car unattended while hiking):**  While leaving a car unattended could be risky for other reasons, the passage focuses on the immediate risk *when entering* the vehicle.



"
根據這段文字，關於蘇達班的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 其總面積的一半為沼澤所覆蓋**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that about **one-third** of the Sundarbans' 3,850 square kilometer area is water or swamp. This means one-third, *not* one-half, is covered in swamps.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

*   **A: 它的特色就是坐擁罕見的巨大叢林** - The text says the forest includes parts of ""huge forests that once spread across the Ganges plain"".
*   **C: 它是世界上最大的紅樹林帶** - The first sentence explicitly states this: ""The Sundarbans is the world’s largest mangrove forest"".
*   **D: 居住在此的梅花鹿比孟加拉虎更多** - The text states there are approximately 30,000 deer and 400 tigers, meaning there are far more deer.



"
哪一部分的森林位於印度境內？,"The correct answer is **A: 巽達班斯國家公園**.

The text specifically states: ""位於印度境內的區域稱為巽達班斯國家公園"" (The area located within India is called Sundarbans National Park).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 野生動物保護區** - While the Sundarbans *is* a wildlife sanctuary, the text doesn't say *which part* is within India, only that it's been protected since 1966.
* **C: 世界遺產** - The entire Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage site, not just the part in India.
* **D: 恆河平原** - The text states the forest *used to* extend across the Ganges plain, but doesn't specify where the remaining parts are located.



"
根據這段文字，誰最有可能至少稍微理解英文？,"The correct answer is **B: 年紀較小的人 (Younger people)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""…more countries have at least some understanding of English, particularly among their younger people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 至少會說兩種其他語言的人 (People who speak at least two other languages)** - While multilingualism *might* correlate with English understanding, the passage doesn't make this connection.
*   **C: 前往多倫多旅行的人 (People traveling to Toronto)** - Travel doesn't guarantee English understanding.
*   **D: 年齡較大的人 (Older people)** - The passage explicitly states that understanding of English is *more* common amongst *younger* people.



"
根據這段文字，什麼東西很難發音？,"The correct answer is **B: 地址**.

The text explicitly states: ""addresses are often difficult to pronounce clearly.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 不同口音的單字 (Different accents of words)** - While the text *mentions* different accents, it doesn't say they are difficult to pronounce, only that they are unique.
* **C: 書面字詞 (Written words)** - The text actually says written words are *easier* to understand than spoken words.
* **D: 當地行話 (Local slang)** - The text mentions local slang, but doesn't state it's difficult to pronounce.



"
根據這段文字，對於打算從區間巴士站搭巴士的旅客來說，何者是理想情況？,"The correct answer is **A: 旅客要前往賈卡爾，並已經先買好了車票**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""especially those going to the east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30"" and ""it is advisable to book your tickets a few days in advance as the interval buses are often full.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While buses *to* Bumthang leave around 7:30, the passage doesn't say the traveler *needs* to leave by 7am.
* **C:** The passage recommends shared taxis for quick trips to Paro, not buses, and doesn't mention a time requirement.
* **D:**  While buses to the East leave around 6:30, the passage doesn't say the traveler needs to *arrive* at the station by 6:20. It just states when the buses depart.



"
對於希望從區間巴士站往東方旅行的遊客來說，何者是好秘訣？,"The correct answer is **B: 購買預售票 (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""由於區間巴士經常客滿，建議您提前幾天購買車票 (Because interval buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance)."" This directly addresses the best tip for traveling from the interval bus station, especially to destinations like the east.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 巴士僅在 8：30 後出發 (Buses only depart after 8:30):** The passage says most buses leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
*   **C: 許多巴士全天候發車 (Many buses depart throughout the day):** The passage states buses depart *all day*, but highlights a rush *between* 06:30 and 07:30.
*   **D: 共乘計程車可能是最明智的旅遊方式 (Shared taxis may be the wisest way to travel):** While shared taxis are *an* option mentioned, the passage doesn't suggest they're specifically better for traveling *east* from the interval bus station - it mentions them as a good option for nearby places like Paro and Punakha.



"
關於廷布克圖的描述，以下何者不正確？,"正確答案是 **C: 搭飛機無法抵達這座城鎮**。

文章中明確提到：「且有一座機場」，這表示廷布克圖是可以搭飛機抵達的。

其他選項都與文章內容相符：

*   **A: 它比該國其他地區更受阿拉伯所影響** - 文章提到「該城市與國內的其它城市有明顯差異，因為它偏向擁有阿拉伯而不是非洲風格。」
*   **B: 它很貧困** - 文章提到「現今的廷巴克圖是一座貧困的城鎮」。
*   **D: 它對充滿好奇心的遊客仍具有吸引力** - 文章提到「過往名聲讓其成為旅遊景點」。"
關於廷布克圖的事實，以下何者為真？,"The correct answer is **A: 搭飛機可以到達這座城鎮**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""且有一座機場."" This directly supports the statement that the city is accessible by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 比起貧窮，它更具有異國情調:** The passage states it *is* a poor town currently, but its *past* reputation gives it an exotic appeal. It doesn't say the exotic appeal outweighs the poverty.
*   **C: 與周邊城市相比，它較不具有非洲風情:** The passage says it ""偏向擁有阿拉伯而不是非洲風格"", which means it *is* different in African style compared to other cities. It doesn't say it has *less* African style, just a different one.
*   **D: 這座城市不再吸引遊客:** The passage says its past reputation makes it a ""旅遊景點,"" implying it still attracts tourists.



"
夏季奧運會原定何時舉行？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 2020 年 7 月**.

The passage states: ""原定舉辦奧運的日期"" (the originally scheduled date for the Olympics) was July 2020. 

While the Paralympics *were* held in August/September 2021, the question asks about the *original* date for the Olympics."
根據這段文字，何時漏斗會變成龍捲風？,"The correct answer is **D: 接觸地面時 (When it touches the ground)**.

The passage states: ""It begins as a funnel descending from a storm cloud and *becomes a ‘tornado’ when it touches the ground*."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Wind speed is mentioned as *typically* 100-200 mph, but this doesn't define when the funnel *becomes* a tornado.
* **B:** While the air column rotating is part of the process, it's not the defining moment of becoming a tornado.
* **C:** The funnel descending is the *beginning* of the process, not when it *becomes* a tornado.



"
關於龍捲風的特徵，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 經常帶著重物移動**.

Here's why:

* **P explicitly states:** ""它們可以將重物抬舉至空中，並隨著龍捲風移動.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While 100-200 mph is *typical*, the passage doesn't say it's *certain*.
* **C:** The passage states the opposite – it *starts* as a funnel descending from the cloud and *becomes* a tornado *upon* reaching the ground.
* **D:** The passage clearly states tornadoes pull air *inward* and *upward*, not outward.



"
根據這段文字，旅客應該自何處取得有關目的地城市政局的建議？,"The correct answer is **D: 他們自己的政府**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""不過他們的建議是為其公民而設計的。"" This means you should consult *your own* government for advice, as their recommendations are tailored to *your* citizenship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 他們將到訪的國家之政府** - The text says government advice is geared towards *their own* citizens, not visitors.
*   **B: 根據旅行公告提出的觀點** - The text critiques government advice as being potentially too broad and simplified.
*   **C: 他們將到訪的國家之公民** - The text doesn't suggest consulting citizens of the country you are visiting.



"
如果有旅遊公告，外國公民不太可能經歷什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 關於該國政局的詳情**.

Here's why:

The passage states that government travel advice is often ""coarse, generalized, and oversimplified"" and doesn't provide ""detailed information"" compared to what might be available elsewhere.  Therefore, if there's a travel advisory, a foreign citizen is *unlikely* to receive detailed information about the country's political situation *from that advisory*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 受影響的行程取消保險** - The passage states travel insurance *might* be affected, meaning it's a likely outcome, not something unlikely.
*   **B: 過度簡化該國政局的概況** - The passage *specifically* says the advice *is* an oversimplified overview - it's what you *will* get, not what you won't.
*   **C: 受影響的健康保險** - Similar to A, the passage says health insurance *might* be affected."
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅行最不可能需要旅行社的預訂協助？,"The correct answer is **A: 出差前去旅客曾去過的城市參加工作會議 (Business trip to a city the traveler has visited before)**.

Here's why:

The passage states travel agencies are *especially* helpful when:

*   The destination is culturally or naturally different from the traveler's experience.
*   The destination is a lower-income country.
*   There are language barriers.
*   It's a type of trip the agency specializes in.

Option A describes a trip to a familiar city for a business purpose. This scenario doesn't meet any of the criteria where a travel agency is particularly beneficial. The traveler has likely been there before, understands the context, and doesn't need help with cultural differences or language.

Let's look at why the other options *would* likely need a travel agency:

*   **B:** A two-week trip with a specific budget benefits from an agency's expertise in finding deals and planning within constraints.
*   **C:** Language barriers are explicitly mentioned as a reason to use a travel agency.
*   **D:** A first-time international trip suggests the traveler might need help with all aspects of planning, making a travel agency valuable.

Therefore, A is the trip that least requires the assistance of a travel agency."
根據這段文字，在哪種情況下，旅客最能因旅行社的協助而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 旅客第一次有興趣預訂特色短途旅行時**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agencies are a good choice ""if the travel destination’s natural environment, culture, or language is beyond the traveler’s experience."" A ""特色短途旅行"" (special short trip) likely implies an unfamiliar destination, culture, or language, especially for someone doing it for the first time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 旅客預訂往返航班到訪家鄉時 (Travelers booking round-trip flights to their hometown):** The passage suggests travel agencies are helpful when destinations are *unfamiliar*, not when going home.
*   **C: 旅客能流利使用度假目的地的母語時 (Travelers fluent in the destination's native language):**  The passage says agencies are helpful when there *is* a language barrier.
*   **D: 旅客到訪他們熟悉文化差異的地方時 (Travelers visiting places where they are familiar with the cultural differences):**  The passage suggests agencies are helpful when there *are* cultural differences beyond the traveler's experience.



"
根據這段文字，何者可以協助旅客在到訪新地方時不會失望？,"The correct answer is **B: 願意嘗試不熟悉的食物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""無論禮節、法律、食物、交通、住宿、行為準則和語言等等，多少都會和你居住的地方有點差異。"" (Regardless of etiquette, laws, food, transportation, accommodation, codes of conduct, and language, etc., there will be some differences from where you live.)  It then says remembering this will prevent disappointment or dislike of local ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 期望當地標準與居住地相似 (Expecting local standards to be the same as where you live):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests. Expecting things to be the same *will* lead to disappointment.
* **C: 遵守與居住地相同的法律 (Following the same laws as where you live):** This is incorrect and potentially dangerous. You need to follow *local* laws.
* **D: 避免事先研究住宿 (Avoiding researching accommodation beforehand):**  While not directly addressed, the passage focuses on being prepared for differences in general. Researching accommodation would likely *help* you avoid disappointment, not cause it.



"
根據文中的資訊，什麼樣的人在去他鄉旅行時可能會感到失望？,"The correct answer is **C: 思想封閉的人**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""This is something you need to keep in mind so you don't get disappointed, or even disgusted with the way things are done locally."" It implies that disappointment arises from *not* accepting that things will be different.
* **""思想封閉"" (closed-minded)** means unwilling to consider new ideas or ways of doing things. This directly leads to disappointment when encountering differences in culture, customs, etc.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 喜歡異國食物的人 (People who like foreign food):**  The passage mentions food as something *different*, but doesn't suggest that liking foreign food would lead to disappointment.
* **B: 在變化中茁壯成長的人 (People who thrive in change):** These people would likely *enjoy* the differences a new place offers.
* **D: 喜歡學習的人 (People who like to learn):**  Similar to B, learners would be open to new experiences and wouldn't be disappointed by differences.

對於首次到訪發展中國家的旅客，不推薦以下哪項建議？,"The correct answer is **B: 避免在前幾天亂買食物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage recommends:**
    * Understanding local animal systems before sleeping on the ground (A).
    * Using a cot or hammock when camping (C).
    * Spending more money on Western-style accommodations, food, and services initially to help adjust (D).

* **The passage does *not* mention avoiding buying food.** While food safety is important in any travel, the passage focuses on cultural adjustment and physical safety from animals.  Avoiding all food purchases isn't a strategy for cultural adjustment.

Therefore, option B is the one suggestion *not* found in the provided text."
在適應發展中國家時，沒有提到在以下哪一項東西上揮霍金錢？,"The correct answer is **C: 露營用床墊或墊子**.

The passage specifically suggests *spending more* money on Western-style hotels, dining, and services to help with the adjustment. It also suggests bringing your *own* folding bed or hammock for outdoor camping to avoid potential dangers. It doesn't mention spending extra money on camping mats or pads specifically – the focus is on bringing something *off the ground* altogether. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 西餐 (Western dining)** - The passage explicitly says to consider spending more on Western-style dining.
*   **B: 優質服務 (Quality services)** - The passage explicitly says to consider spending more on quality services.
*   **D: 優質飯店 (Quality hotels)** - The passage explicitly says to consider spending more on Western-style hotels.



"
以下何者最適合想要保單虛擬副本但可能無法存取網路的投保人？,"The correct answer is **C: 將副本儲存在筆電的記憶體中 (Store a copy on your laptop's memory)**.

Here's why:

* **The question specifically asks for a virtual copy accessible *without* internet access.**
* **Option A (給旅伴一份副本 - Give a copy to a travel companion):**  This provides a physical copy to someone else, not a virtual copy for the insured person themselves.
* **Option B (透過電子郵件向自己傳送副本 - Email a copy to yourself):** Requires internet access to retrieve the email.
* **Option D (將副本儲存在「雲端」 - Store a copy in ""the cloud""):**  *Requires* internet access to access the cloud storage.
* **Option C (將副本儲存在筆電的記憶體中 - Store a copy on your laptop's memory):**  Allows access to the copy even *without* an internet connection, as it's stored directly on the device.  The text specifically recommends this for situations ""when there is no internet.""



"
根據這段文字，以下何者不需要顯示在保單上？,"The correct answer is **D: 投保人的電子郵件地址**.

The text specifically states the need for the insurance company's email address and international phone number for consultation/authorization and claims. It doesn't mention needing the *policyholder's* email address on the policy itself or the copies you carry.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 用於申請理賠的國際電話號碼 (International phone number for claims)** - The text explicitly states you need this.
*   **B: 保險公司的電子郵件地址 (Insurance company's email address)** - The text explicitly states you need this.
*   **C: 用於授權的國際電話號碼 (International phone number for authorization)** - The text explicitly states you need this.



"
根據這段文字，哪種負片尺寸反映了最常用的底片格式？,"The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 毫米負片**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""standard 35mm film (a 36x24mm negative) is the most common."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 6 x 6 釐米負片:** While mentioned, the text says this is used by *some* medium format cameras, not that it's the most common.
*   **B: 56 x 56 毫米負片:** This is a more precise measurement of the medium format negative, but still not the most common format.
*   **C: 35 毫米負片:** While related, the text specifies the actual negative size is 36x24mm.



"
以下哪種底片格式提供近似於數位單眼相機的解析度？,"The correct answer is **A: 35 毫米底片**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""標準的 35 公釐底片 (36×24 公釐負片) ... 解析度堪可比擬現代的數位單眼相機.""  This directly answers the question.

While medium format (6cm x 6cm or 56mm x 56mm) has *higher* resolution than 35mm, the question asks for the format that is *comparable* to digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, and that's 35mm according to the text.
"
根據這段文字，何者將是進入遊記寫作產業的最後一步？,"The correct answer is **C: 建立自己的網站**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *simplest* way to get into travel writing is to practice on established blogs, *then* potentially create your own website. This indicates building your own website is the logical next step *after* gaining experience on existing platforms. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 練習在網路上編排格式** - This is a skill you develop *before* building a site, not the final step.
*   **B: 為信譽良好的旅遊部落格撰寫幾篇文章** - This is the *first* step described in the passage.
*   **D: 磨練編輯技巧** - Like formatting, this is a skill built *before* creating your own platform.



"
進入遊記寫作產業時，應該首先完善以下哪些能力？,"The correct answer is **A: 寫部落格 (Writing blogs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *simplest* way to enter the travel writing industry is to **practice your skills on established travel blogs**. This directly implies that the initial focus should be on *writing* for blogs.

While options B and C (formatting and editing) are mentioned as things you'll become familiar with *through* blogging, they aren't the primary skill to develop first. Option D (building a website) is presented as a *later* step – something you do *after* you're comfortable with the online format.

Therefore, the foundational skill to develop when starting out is **writing blogs**.
"
腸道問題在什麼類型的氣候下很常見？,"The correct answer is **C: 炎熱的氣候**.

The passage explicitly states: ""就像寒冷氣候常見的呼吸系統問題，腸道問題在炎熱氣候也相當普遍..."" 

Therefore, the passage directly links intestinal problems to warm climates."
根據這段文字，經常接觸什麼東西會對它產生免疫力？,"The correct answer is **B: 在地細菌 (local bacteria)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""由於在家持續接觸在地細菌，您很有可能已經對它們免疫了。"" (Because you are continuously exposed to local bacteria at home, you are very likely to have become immune to them.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 腸道問題 (intestinal problems)** - The passage states intestinal problems are *common* in warm climates, but doesn't say you become immune to them through exposure.
*   **C: 呼吸系統問題 (respiratory problems)** - The passage uses respiratory problems as a comparison to intestinal problems, not as something you gain immunity to.
*   **D: 德里肚 (Delhi belly)** - Delhi belly is a *type* of intestinal problem caused by new bacteria, not something you become immune to.



"
以下何者是在申根區內旅行的優點？,"The correct answer is **A: 避免多次申請簽證 (Avoid multiple visa applications)** and **C: 避免多次護照檢查 (Avoid multiple passport checks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""如持有申根簽證，你就不需要分別申請每個申根會員國的簽證，從而節省了時間、金錢和文書作業。"" (If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state, saving time, money and paperwork.)
* **The passage also states:** ""只要您待在此區域，一般而言，不必再次通過護照控制檢查站，即可出入邊境。"" (As long as you stay in this area, generally, you do not need to go through passport control checkpoints again to enter or exit borders.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 省錢 (Save money)** - While mentioned as a *result* of not needing multiple visas, it's not the primary benefit *of travelling within* the Schengen area itself.
* **D: 無護照要求 (No passport requirement)** - The passage states you *generally* don't need to go through passport control *again*, not that you don't need a passport at all.  You still need a passport to enter the Schengen area initially.

Therefore, both A and C are correct answers, directly supported by the text."
圖坦卡門墓中再也找不到什麼東西？,"The correct answer is **D: 財富** (wealth).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The magnificent riches within the tomb are no longer in the tomb, but have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo."" This directly indicates that the wealth/riches are no longer found in the tomb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一些裝飾 (Some decorations):** The passage doesn't state that decorations are missing, only that the riches are gone.
*   **B: 木乃伊的頭 (The mummy's head):** The passage says you *can* see the mummy's head.
*   **C: 木乃伊的肩膀 (The mummy's shoulders):** The passage says you *can* see the mummy's shoulders.



"
根據這段文字，溫哥華哪個目的地對注重價格的旅客最沒有吸引力？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 惠斯勒**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Whistler is ""expensive and famous"". This directly implies it's not a budget-friendly option. The other options aren't described as being particularly expensive:

*   **固蘭湖島 (Granville Island)** is mentioned as the departure point for the Bowen Island ferry – it doesn't indicate pricing.
*   **海天走廊 (Sea to Sky Corridor)** is described as a place to *go* (for hiking), but there’s no mention of cost.
*   **寶雲島 (Bowen Island)** is presented as a popular day/weekend trip with activities like kayaking, hiking, shopping, and dining, but again, no information about pricing is given to suggest it is expensive.

Therefore, **惠斯勒** is the only destination explicitly identified as being expensive."
根據這段文字，哪個目的地最有可能賦予旅客真實的溫哥華體驗？,"The correct answer is **A: 寶雲島**.

Here's why:

The text specifically describes 寶雲島 as a ""道地社區"" (authentic community). This directly implies it offers a more genuine, local experience of the Vancouver area. 

* **惠斯勒** is described as ""貴又出名"" and caters heavily to tourism, making it less likely to be considered ""authentic"".
* **溫哥華市中心** is simply the starting point for getting to 寶雲島.
* **固蘭湖島** is only mentioned as the departure location for the water taxi.

Therefore, 寶雲島 is the only option presented as offering a truly local and ""authentic"" Vancouver experience.



"
根據這段文字，如果追求一覽無遺的景色，旅客應該何時到訪瀑布？,"The correct answer is **D: 除雨季之外** (Except during the rainy season).

Here's why:

The passage states that during the rainy season (November to March) the waterfall is more spectacular *but* the view of the waterfall itself is obscured by the large amount of water. Therefore, to have an unobstructed view, you should visit *outside* of the rainy season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 十一月至三月 (November to March)** - This is the rainy season, which the text says *hides* the view.
*   **B: 旅遊旺季 (Peak season)** - The text doesn't correlate peak season with the best viewing conditions.
*   **C: 當水量多時 (When the water volume is high)** -  High water volume obscures the view, according to the passage.



"
根據這段文字，在十一月至三月期間參觀維多利亞瀑布有什麼優點？,"The correct answer is **C: 壯麗的瀑布景觀 (Spectacular views of the waterfall)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""雨季（十一月至三月）水量會高出許多，瀑布會更加壯觀 (During the rainy season - November to March - the water volume is much higher and the falls are more spectacular).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一覽無遺的瀑布景觀 (Unobstructed views of the waterfall)** - The passage actually says the large volume of water *obscures* the view of the falls.
*   **B: 寥寥無幾的遊客 (Few tourists)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the number of tourists. It states it is a popular destination.
*   **D: 避開雨季 (Avoiding the rainy season)** - The question asks about the *benefits* of visiting *during* the rainy season.



"
根據這段文字，使用無人機拍攝時，不建議使用以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 僅在無人機不會引起注意的人群擁擠區拍攝**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...將無人機開到...飛過人群上方，就算不違反所在地法律，此舉幾乎都是壞主意。"" (Flying a drone over crowds, even if not illegal, is almost always a bad idea.) Option D describes doing exactly that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 提前檢查可以拍攝的內容 (Check what you can film in advance):** The text directly recommends this: ""若要使用無人機，請事先仔細確認可以拍攝什麼..."" (If you want to use a drone, carefully check beforehand what you can film...)
* **B: 取得額外授權 (Obtain extra authorization):** The text also recommends this: ""...是否需要什麼許可或額外授權."" ( ...whether you need any permits or extra authorization.)
* **C: 研究許可證 (Research permits):** This aligns with the idea of checking what's allowed and needing authorization.



"
根據這段文字，使用無人機拍攝的最佳地點在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **D: 事先取得許可的地區 (Areas with prior permission)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""若要使用無人機，請事先仔細確認可以拍攝什麼以及是否需要什麼許可或額外授權。"" (If you want to use a drone, carefully confirm in advance what you can film and whether any permits or additional authorization are required.) This highlights the importance of getting permission.
* **The text also warns against:** flying near airports or over crowds, even if legally permissible. This indicates that ideal locations are *not* near people or restricted areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 靠近不介意無人機存在的人群 (Near crowds who don't mind drones):** The text specifically advises *against* flying over people.
* **B: 不允許一般攝影的區域 (Areas where general photography is not allowed):** The passage states filming has *more* restrictions than photography, so areas restricted for photography would definitely be restricted for filming.
* **C: 在無人機不太明顯的繁忙之地 (A busy place where the drone is not noticeable):**  While trying to be discreet might seem appealing, it doesn't address the legal or safety concerns raised in the text. The text is about knowing the rules and obtaining permission.



"
根據這段文字，關於簽證程序的註冊要求，哪種說法為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 所有國家/地區都要求向當地政府機關登記註冊**.

Here's why:

* The passage states registration is an *additional requirement in **some** countries* (not all). It doesn't claim it's universal.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

* **A: 如果您住在遊客住宿處，您可能不需要登記** - The text says ""In other cases, only those *not* staying in visitor accommodations need to register."" This implies you might *not* need to register if you stay in visitor accommodations.
* **C: 可能需要走一趟移民局** - The passage explicitly states ""...may need to visit the immigration office.""
* **D: 在某些地方，當地飯店可以處理登記註冊** - The passage states ""...local hotels will handle the registration for you (be sure to ask).""



"
以下何者不是遊客可能去辦理登記註冊的地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 當地郵局 (Local post office)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**
    * ""可能須至當地警局填寫表單"" (You may need to go to the local police station to fill out forms)
    * ""走一趟移民局"" (Go to the immigration office)
    * ""當地飯店將處理登記事宜"" (Local hotels will handle the registration)

* **The passage does NOT mention** needing to register at a local post office.

Therefore, the local post office is the only option that isn't a potential registration location according to the text.
"
誰不會因旅行時參加志願活動而受益？,"正確答案是 **B: 追求豐厚薪水的人**。

理由如下：

*   **P段落中明確指出**許多志願工作提供食宿，甚至 *少數* 工作會支付 *微薄* 薪水。這意味著志願活動並非賺錢的好方法。
*   選項A、C、D都符合段落中描述的志願活動的好處：結交朋友、獲得技能、享受食宿。

因此，追求豐厚薪水的人，從旅行時參加志願活動 *不會* 受益，反而可能覺得不符合需求。"
根據這段文字，在國外做志工對預算有限的旅客有什麼好處？,"The correct answer is **C: 有時會提供食宿 (Sometimes provides food and lodging)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""由於許多志願性的工作均提供食宿，而少數工作還支付微薄薪水，這也不失為放寬預算，以便在某個地方停留更久的好方法."" (Because many volunteer jobs provide food and lodging, and a few even pay a small salary, it's also a good way to stretch your budget and stay in a place longer).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 幾乎都有給薪 (Almost always paid):** The passage says *a few* offer a small salary, not almost all.
* **B: 通常會帶來工作機會 (Usually leads to job opportunities):** The passage doesn't mention job opportunities. It focuses on personal growth and budget benefits.
* **D: 可以幫助取得看事情的某種角度 (Can help gain a perspective on things):** While true, this is a benefit *in addition* to the financial one, and isn't the specific benefit for budget travelers.



"
根據這段文字，何者可能被認為是一般前往迪士尼世界旅行的非典型行程？,"The correct answer is **B: 住在園區外的飯店**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the ""typical"" trip as including staying at a Disney hotel.  Anything *different* from that would be non-typical.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在迪士尼園區玩上一週** (Spending a week in the Disney parks) - This is specifically mentioned as part of the *typical* trip.
* **C: 在迪士尼園區度過整個旅程** (Spending the entire trip in the Disney parks) - This implies spending the whole time *in* the parks, which aligns with the typical week-long visit. It's not stated whether time is spent elsewhere.
* **D: 從機場坐巴士到飯店** (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel) - This is also described as part of the standard, ""typical"" journey.



"
關於迪士尼世界的陳述中，以下何者為非？,"正確答案是 **A: 跨園門票可轉讓給其他旅客**。

文章中明確指出迪士尼禁止門票轉讓，即使在 eBay 或 Craigslist 上找到的是已使用一部分的門票，迪士尼仍然認為這是不合法的。

其他選項都與文章內容相符：

*   **B:** 文章提到「搭巴士前往迪士尼飯店」，表示園區內提供住宿。
*   **C:** 文章提到「搭巴士前往迪士尼飯店」，表示有巴士從機場載送旅客到住宿。
*   **D:** 文章提到「許多在 eBay 或 Craigslist 等拍賣網站上賣出的票券...」，說明可以在拍賣網站上找到多日聯票。

"
根據這段文字，在專業培訓課程或出版物中最有可能沒有涵蓋以下哪個問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 荒野求生 (Wilderness Survival)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""荒野求生的書籍和雜誌很常見 (Publications on wilderness survival are common)..."" This indicates that wilderness survival is *already* widely covered and readily available elsewhere.  The text emphasizes the *lack* of resources regarding war zones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 急救準備 (First Aid Preparation):** The passage explicitly mentions ""大量的急救訓練 (extensive first aid training)"" as part of the courses.
* **C: 戰區戰備 (War Zone Preparedness):** The entire point of the ""敵意環境課程 (hostile environment courses)"" is to prepare people for war zones.
* **D: 角色扮演 (Role-Playing):**  The passage specifically states that role-playing is a component of the training courses.

Therefore, wilderness survival is the one topic *least* likely to be a focus of specialized training for war zones, as it's already a well-documented subject.



"
根據這段文字，專業培訓課程最有可能涵蓋以下哪些科目？,"The correct answer is **A: 急救**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the courses involve ""大量的急救訓練"" (a lot of first aid training). While the courses relate to war zones (B) and hostile environments (D), and might *incorporate* elements of wilderness survival (C), **急救** is the one explicitly mentioned as a core component of the training. 

Therefore, option A is the most directly supported by the text.



"
根據這段文字，避開潛在污水的最佳選擇是什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 購買瓶裝水**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""...if you have any concerns, it is advisable to purchase bottled water from a reputable company."" This directly suggests bottled water as the *best* option when unsure about water safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 將水燒開幾分鐘 (Boiling water for several minutes)** - While boiling is mentioned, the passage highlights that the *required* boiling time varies. It's not presented as the *best* solution overall.
* **C: 將水燒開一分鐘 (Boiling water for one minute)** - The passage specifies this is only sufficient *in some areas*, not universally.
* **D: 評估水中的特定威脅 (Evaluating specific threats in the water)** - The passage doesn't suggest this as a solution for *avoiding* contaminated water; it's the reason why you might *need* a more reliable solution like bottled water.



"
根據這段文字，什麼事情是連熟練的游泳者也幾乎不可能做到的？,"The correct answer is **C: 逆著海流游回去**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""大部分致死原因都是在嘗試逆著海流游回去時用盡體力，此舉成功率可能非常渺茫。"" (Most fatalities are caused by exhausting themselves trying to swim back against the current, an attempt that is likely futile.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在珊瑚礁附近游泳 (Swimming near a coral reef):** The text mentions reefs as places where rip currents *occur*, but doesn't say swimming near them is impossible.
*   **B: 在深水中游泳 (Swimming in deep water):** The text mentions rip currents flow *towards* deep water, but doesn't say swimming in deep water itself is impossible.
*   **D: 在海浪中游泳 (Swimming in the waves):** The text explains how rip currents *form from* waves, but doesn't suggest swimming in waves is impossible.



"
如果困在海流中，該怎麼辦？,"The correct answer is **A: 試著改變方向來脫離水流，然後正常游回岸邊**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Once you are out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than usual."" and ""Try to swim to a place where you won’t get caught in the current again."" This directly supports trying to swim *out* of the current, not against it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 逆流游得更快:** The passage explicitly says this is a *major* cause of death, as it quickly exhausts you.
* **C: 往相反方向游泳:** This is the same as trying to swim against the current - it will exhaust you.
* **D: 在水面下游泳:** This is not mentioned in the text and wouldn't help escape a rip current.  Staying afloat and conserving energy are more important.



"
根據這段文字，在哪個地方參觀城堡可能會是一趟值得的假期遊覽？,"The correct answer is **C: 萊茵河谷**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""例如參觀羅亞爾河谷及**萊茵河谷**的城堡"" (For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley and the **Rhine Valley**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 多瑙河沿岸的城市:** The passage mentions visiting ""intriguing cities"" along the Danube, but *not* castles.
* **B: 伊利運河旁邊:** The passage mentions canoeing along the Illy Canal, but doesn't mention castles there.
* **D: 近任何內陸水道之處:** While true in a general sense, the question asks about where you can visit castles *according to the passage*, and the Rhine Valley is the specific example given.



"
根據這段文字，以下哪個方法不推薦給在該地區旅行的女性？,"The correct answer is **A: 避免討論婚姻狀況**.

Here's why:

The text *specifically recommends* that women travelers **claim to be married**, regardless of their actual marital status, and even suggests wearing a ring.  Therefore, *avoiding* discussing marital status is the opposite of the advice given.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: 注意文化差異可能會導致當地人出現強硬行為** - The text explicitly warns about cultural differences leading to behaviors like harassment and being followed.
* **C: 避免佩戴顯眼的珠寶** - The text advises against wearing rings that look ""too expensive.""
* **D: 必要時應態度強硬** - The text states ""be firm when refusing men, and don’t be afraid to stand your ground.""



"
根據文中所述區域，什麼小常識對女性旅客有幫助？,"The correct answer is **A: 認知到遭人跟蹤並非常事 (Recognizing that being followed is common)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""文化差異可能會導致某些她們視為騷擾的情況，被人跟蹤、手臂被人抓住等狀況並不少見。"" (Cultural differences may lead to situations they consider harassment, such as being followed, arms being grabbed, etc., are not uncommon.) This means women should *expect* the possibility of being followed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 戴大戒指表示婚姻狀況 (Wearing a large ring indicates marital status):** The text specifically advises *against* wearing expensive-looking rings.
* **C: 瞭解文化差異間接表明您避免堅持自己的立場 (Understanding cultural differences implies avoiding sticking to your own position):** The text actually encourages women to *firmly* assert themselves and not be afraid to stand their ground, *despite* cultural differences.
* **D: 不願接受男性示好，即堅決拒絕 (Unwilling to accept male advances, i.e., firmly refuse):** While the text does advise firm refusal, simply stating ""firmly refuse"" doesn't capture the important context of understanding how common unwanted attention is in this region. Recognizing it's common is the helpful piece of knowledge.



"
根據這段文字，哪種情況可能需要野生動物攝影師使用專業鏡頭？,"The correct answer is **A: If they are shooting particularly small creatures.**

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""拍攝一群鳥類或一隻小型動物則需要其他鏡頭"" (shooting a flock of birds or a small animal requires other lenses). This directly links the need for different lenses to the size of the subject.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: If it's commercial shooting:** The text mentions restrictions on *commercial* shooting, but doesn't say this necessitates specific lenses.
* **C: If the animals are shy:** While shyness is a challenge, the text doesn't link it to needing different lenses. It mentions animals being fearful generally.
* **D: If the park has special regulations for wildlife photography:** Regulations are mentioned, but again, not linked to lens requirements.



"
文中沒有提到以下何者對野生動物攝影師來說是一個潛在的挑戰？,"The correct answer is **C: 採購所需的鏡頭類型 (Purchasing the necessary types of lenses)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...野生動物攝影通常需要使用長焦鏡頭，而拍攝一群鳥類或一隻小型動物則需要其他鏡頭."" This implies that knowing *which* lenses are needed is part of the skill/experience, not a *challenge* in itself.  It's a requirement, not an obstacle.

Let's look at why the other options are challenges mentioned in the text:

* **A: 尋找特定的珍稀動物 (Finding specific rare animals)** - The passage says: ""許多珍稀的動物很難發現"" (Many rare animals are difficult to find).
* **B: 面對具攻擊性的動物 (Facing aggressive animals)** - The passage says: ""野生動物可能很怕生或很有攻擊性"" (Wildlife may be shy or aggressive).
* **D: 在潛在的敵對環境中工作 (Working in potentially hostile environments)** - The passage says: ""...生存環境可能很冷、很熱或很不友善"" (Survival environments can be cold, hot, or unfriendly).

Therefore, purchasing lenses isn't presented as a challenge, but as a necessary part of the job."
以下何者可能最不會對途經山口的司機造成問題？,"正確答案是 **A: 塞車**。

**理由:**

文章重點強調高海拔或山路上因天氣因素造成的行車困難，像是：

*   **低摩擦力:** 結冰和積雪路面導致。
*   **可見度降低:** 雪、暴風雪、冷凝作用、結冰都可能造成。

文章雖然提到冰雪氣候常見，交通通常暢通，但塞車本身與天氣因素無直接關聯，與文章重點不符。塞車可能因為其他原因發生，但不是高海拔或山路駕駛的 *固有* 問題。

因此，塞車是最不可能對途經山口的司機造成問題的選項。"
關於各國的所得稅，何者可能保持一致？,"The correct answer is **C: 申報所得稅的地方**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""除非你是外交官，否則在海外工作通常表示你必須在所在國家申報所得稅.""  This directly indicates that regardless of the country, you generally declare taxes *in the country where you are working*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 稅率 (Tax rates):** The passage explicitly says tax rates ""vary greatly"" between countries.
* **B: 所得稅結構 (Tax structure):** The passage states ""所得稅結構各不相同"" (tax structures are different).
* **D: 等級差異 (Differences in levels/brackets):**  The passage states ""各國的稅率及等級差異也相當大"" (tax rates and levels differ greatly).

Therefore, the only consistent element across countries, according to the passage, is *where* you file your taxes (in the country of employment)."
根據這段文字，如果你在海外工作，但居住在他處，你可能會在哪裡申報所得稅？,"The correct answer is **C: 目前工作的國家**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means you have to file income tax in the country where you are working."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 居住國家 (Country of Residence):** While residence is *a* factor in taxation generally, the passage specifically focuses on the country *where you work* as the place for filing taxes.
* **B: 美國 (United States):** The passage only mentions the US as an example of a country with both federal and local taxes. It doesn't say you *must* file there if working abroad.
* **D: 所得稅最低的地方 (Place with the Lowest Income Tax):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about choosing a location based on tax rates. It states you generally file in the country where you *work*.



"
關於世界博覽會的敘述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 植物展覽品與藝術及教育展覽品一起陳列**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that World Expos (世博會) focus on art and science, while World Horticultural Expos (世界園藝博覽會) *specifically* focus on plants.** They are different types of events.  The passage doesn't say they happen *together* or that plant exhibits are part of a general World Expo.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 展覽品可能會展示一個國家/地區的歷史或文化** - The passage states that countries showcase their culture and history in their pavilions.
* **C: 活動可持續長達六個月** - The passage says these events usually last 3-6 months.
* **D: 國家/地區非強迫參與** -  The passage implies participation is voluntary since it says countries ""參與"" (participate) and doesn't mention any requirement to do so.



"
以下哪項是世界博覽會或國際博覽會的規則？,"The correct answer is **B: 同一國家不能每年舉辦活動**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...儘管理論上可以年年舉辦（只要辦在不同國家/地區就好了），實際上則不然.""  This directly translates to ""Although theoretically it could be held every year (as long as it's in a different country/region), it's not actually the case."" This implies a rule against the same country hosting consecutively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 展覽品必須同時展示一個國家的歷史和世界議題** - The text says exhibits *can* showcase these things, not that they *must*.
* **C: 活動必須持續長達六個月** - The text states the event typically lasts *3 to 6 months*, not necessarily a full six months.
* **D: 為了舉辦博覽會，所有國家/地區都必須參加** - The text doesn't mention any requirement for universal participation. It states ""參與國"" (participating countries), indicating it's not mandatory for everyone.



"
採取以下哪一項措施可以降低動物攻擊的可能性？,"The correct answer is **B: 清除野營地的垃圾 (Clear camping areas of garbage)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""此外，要注意氣味會吸引熊和其他野生動物，因此請避免攜帶或烹煮氣味濃重的食物，並維持營地乾淨 (Moreover, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly-scented foods and keep campsites clean).""  Removing garbage reduces odors that attract animals, lowering the chance of an encounter and potential attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 攜帶有香氣的草藥 (Carry fragrant herbs):** The passage advises *avoiding* strong smells, not attracting animals with them.
* **C: 與狼保持 25 碼的距離 (Keep a distance of 25 yards from wolves):** The passage states to keep *100 yards* from bears and wolves, and *25 yards* from *other* wildlife. While keeping a distance is good, this isn't the action directly linked to reducing attraction.
* **D: 用食物殘渣阻撓動物 (Distract animals with food scraps):** The passage clearly warns *against* feeding animals.  This would increase the risk of an attack, not decrease it.



"
文中未提到以下何者為野生動物襲擊的可能原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 不熟悉人類的動物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:**
    * **B: 未能保持距離** - ""每年有數十名遊客因為未保持適當距離而受傷.""
    * **C: 餵養野生動物** - ""野生動物畢竟是野生的，因此不應餵食或打擾它們.""
    * **A: 強烈的氣味** - ""要注意氣味會吸引熊和其他野生動物...""

* **The passage does *not* mention** that animals being unfamiliar with humans is a cause of attacks. It focuses on respecting their wild nature and maintaining a safe distance *regardless* of how accustomed they seem to people.

Therefore, option D is the only one *not* discussed as a cause of wildlife attacks in the provided text.



"
根據文章，以下哪個不會被認為是順利演奏手風琴的正確建議？,"The correct answer is **A: 要增大音量，請增加敲擊按鍵的力度**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""請記住，不需要像彈鋼琴一樣用力敲擊琴鍵來增加音量."" (Remember, you don't need to hit the keys as hard as when playing the piano to increase the volume). 

Options B, C, and D are all directly supported by the text. Option A contradicts the text's advice.
"
當演奏手風琴時，以下哪個有助於增加音量？,"The correct answer is **B: 加大力道 (Apply more force)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""若要增大音量，可更用力或更快速擠壓風箱 (To increase volume, you can press the bellows harder or faster).""  While speed is also mentioned, force (大力道) is a direct answer to how to increase volume.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 加快速度 (Increase speed):** While speed *can* contribute to volume, the passage prioritizes force.
*   **C: 減少施力 (Reduce force):** This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
*   **D: 減少手指移動 (Reduce finger movement):** This focuses on efficiency and reducing fatigue, not increasing volume.



"
電視上的影像為什麼要裁剪邊框？,"The correct answer is **B: 讓影像填滿整個螢幕**.

The passage explicitly states that cropping the edges of the image (""over-scanning"") is done ""to ensure the image covers the entire screen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 為了容納字幕** - The passage actually says that *because* of overscanning, subtitles can get cut off.
*   **C: 為了方便轉換成其他格式** - The passage discusses the problems during DVD conversion *resulting from* TV overscan, not overscan being done for format conversion.
*   **D: 為了避免字幕太靠近底部** - This is the opposite of what the passage states - overscan can cause subtitles near the bottom to be cut off."
根據文章，將電影轉換為 DVD 格式可能會遇到以下哪些問題？,"The correct answer is **B: 部分字幕會被裁減 (Some subtitles will be cut off)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that when converting to DVD, the edges of the film might be cut off, and this can lead to subtitles at the bottom of the screen being incomplete.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 影像未填滿整個螢幕 (Image doesn't fill the entire screen):** The passage explains that television broadcasts *overscan* to *fill* the screen, not the other way around.
* **C: 影像填滿整個螢幕 (Image fills the entire screen):** This is the effect of overscan on televisions, not a problem encountered when making DVDs.
* **D: 裁剪邊框 (Cropping the borders):** While cropping happens, the *problem* isn't the cropping itself, but the consequences of cropping (like losing subtitles).
"
英國駐軍在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **C: 博登敦鎮**.

The passage states: ""約翰·卡德瓦爾德 (John Cadwalder) 將軍將對在**博登敦 (Bordentown)** 的英國駐軍發動牽制攻擊..."" This directly answers the question of where the British troops are stationed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 阿遜平克溪** - James Ewing is sent to *occupy the bridge* over Assunpink Creek, not where the British are stationed.
* **B: 特倫頓** - The main force attacks *towards* Trenton, but it's not where the British are initially located.
* **D: 普林斯頓** - Princeton is not mentioned in the text.



"
手寫草案上出現了誰的簽名？,"The correct answer is **D: 查爾斯·湯姆森 (Charles Thomson)**.

The passage states the draft was signed by **John Hancock and Charles Thomson**. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 約翰·當列普 (John Dunlap)** - He *printed* the document, he didn't sign the draft.
*   **B: 喬治·華盛頓 (George Washington)** - He *received* and read a copy, but didn't sign the draft.
*   **C: 約翰·尼克森 (John Nixon)** - He *read* the document publicly, but didn't sign the draft.



"
在以下地點中，哪個地方最後收到當列普單面印刷版？,"The correct answer is **C: 倫敦**.

Here's why:

* **倫敦**在8月10日收到副本，這是文中提到的最後一個收到文件的地點。
* **當列普印刷坊**在7月4日印刷了文件，是最早收到文件的地方之一。
* **紐約**在7月9日收到，早於倫敦。
* **費城獨立紀念館**是文件公開宣讀的地點，但不是收到文件的地點。"
史塔克上校的的部隊位於哪裡？,"The correct answer is **A: 北端柵欄沿線的位置**.

The text states: ""史塔克的人馬佔領了殖民軍據點北端柵欄沿線的位置."" (Stark's men occupied positions along the north end of the colonial fort's fence line.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 在河流末端的沙灘上** - They *built* stone walls extending *to* the beach, but didn't occupy it initially.
* **C: 沿著半島東北部** - The text specifies the *north* end, not northeast.
* **D: 在柵欄前** - They built a stake *in front* of the fence, but were positioned *along* the fence.



"
根據文章，史塔克的手下什麼時候擴展了他們的柵欄？,"The correct answer is **C: 退潮時**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""沿著半島西北部流動的神秘河，在退潮時打開了一個缺口，他們利用這個時機迅速建造小石牆，將圍牆延伸到北方河流末端的小沙灘上。""

This directly links the extension of the fence to the timing of the low tide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 當殖民者號召增援的時候** - While reinforcements arrived, the text doesn't say the fence was extended *because* of them.
*   **B: 當正規軍通過木樁後** - The instructions were *not* to fire until the regulars passed the stake; the fence was extended *before* this point.
*   **D: 當部隊佔據前沿陣地時** - The fence extension happened *after* occupying the initial position, specifically during the low tide.



"
根據文章，以下哪個是中國最動盪的時期之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 三國時期**.

The passage specifically states: ""其中最著名的就是漢朝和晉朝之間 60 年的三國時代。在這些時期中，許多貴族之間為了爭奪王位，進行了激烈的戰爭。三國是中國古代歷史上最血腥的時代之一..."" (Among the most famous is the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties. During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for the throne. The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 晉朝** - While mentioned in relation to the Three Kingdoms, the passage doesn't identify the Jin dynasty *as* a particularly turbulent period itself.
*   **B: 西安時期** - The passage mentions the ""西安宏偉皇宮"" (Xi'an grand palace) as a place people fought *for* the throne, but doesn't say the period of Xi'an itself was turbulent.
*   **C: 漢朝** - The Han dynasty is mentioned as *preceding* the turbulent Three Kingdoms period, but isn't identified as turbulent itself.



"
根據文章，關於螞蟻大軍群體進入游獵階段，以下敘述何者為真？,"The correct answer is **B: 牠們糧食供應不足**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the colony enters the nomadic phase ""when food supplies diminish."" The hunting phase *precedes* the nomadic phase, therefore, the reason for entering the nomadic phase (and thus the state of the colony before it) is a lack of food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 牠們在夜間築巢** - The passage states they *camp* during the day in the hunting phase, not build nests at night.
*   **C: 他們築巢的週期為 17 天** - The 17-day period applies to the nomadic phase (migration), not the hunting phase.
*   **D: 牠們在白天行進** - The passage states they move during the *night* in the hunting phase.



"
根據文章，以下哪種說法正確反映了螞蟻大軍在遊牧階段的築巢習性？,"The correct answer is **C: 牠們每天更換巢穴**.

Here's why:

The passage states that during the nomadic phase, the colony ""builds temporary shelters and changes them daily."" This directly supports the idea that they change nests every day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 牠們在夜間築巢** - The passage says they are active at night during the *hunting* phase, not the nomadic phase.
*   **B: 牠們能行進 17 天期間不築巢** - The passage explicitly states they build *temporary* shelters.
*   **D: 牠們在整個階段中使用相同的巢穴** - This is the opposite of what the passage says about daily changes.



"
儘管出現外在信號，以下何者會繼續運行？,"The correct answer is **C: 生理時鐘 (Physiological clock)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""生理時鐘是自我維持的振盪器，即使沒有外部信號，也會持續自主運行的週期。"" (Physiological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate periodically even without external signals.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 內生性週期 (Endogenous cycles):** While related to the physiological clock, the passage says the clock *produces* these cycles, it doesn't say the cycles themselves continue without signals.
* **B: 週期性節奏 (Periodic rhythms):** The passage says these can respond to external cues.
* **D: 觀察到的節奏 (Observed rhythms):**  These are what scholars *see* and are influenced by both internal and external factors.

Therefore, the physiological clock is the only element specifically described as continuing to run even *despite* external signals."
哪個術語描述了呈現特定表徵多種差異的個體？,"The correct answer is **D: 多態性 (Polymorphism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""如果個體某項特徵呈現多種差異，即稱為多態性。"" (If individuals exhibit multiple differences in a characteristic, it is called polymorphism.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 單型性 (Monomorphism):** The passage defines this as *consistency* in characteristics, the *opposite* of what the question asks for.
* **B: 生物 (Organism):** This is a very broad term, referring to any living thing. It doesn't describe variation *within* a group.
* **C: 物種 (Species):** This refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed, but doesn't specifically address differences in characteristics *within* that species.



"
關於佔據特定區域的生物，以下何者為正確術語？,"The correct answer is **B: 族群 (Population)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""族群指的是在特定地理區域中活動的單一特定物種生物個體組成的群體."" This directly defines a population as the group of individuals of a *single species* in a *specific area*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 單型性 (Uniformity):** This describes a characteristic *within* a population, not the population itself. It means all individuals are the same in a specific trait.
* **C: 物種 (Species):**  A species is a broader category – all organisms capable of interbreeding. A population is a group *within* a species.
* **D: 多態性 (Polymorphism):**  This also describes a characteristic *within* a population – variation in traits. It's the opposite of uniformity.



"
以下哪種不是以自然為主題的旅遊活動範例？,"The correct answer is **C: 參觀科學博物館 (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically lists activities enjoyed *in nature* as examples of nature-themed tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems. It even gives the example of visiting Borneo to see orangutans.

*   **A: 健行到瀑布 (Hiking to a waterfall)** is an activity directly *in* nature.
*   **B: 拍攝野花 (Photographing wildflowers)** is also an activity done *in* nature.
*   **D: 釣魚 (Fishing)** is explicitly mentioned as an example in the passage.
*   **C: 參觀科學博物館 (Visiting a science museum)**, while it *might* have exhibits *about* nature, is not an activity *in* nature itself. It's an indoor, built environment activity.

Therefore, visiting a science museum is the one that doesn't fit the description of a nature-themed tourism activity provided in the text."
根據文章，以下哪個是交通系統的基礎？,"The correct answer is **B: 私家車 (Private cars)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...this traffic system is based on private cars..."" ( ""...這個以私家車為基礎的交通系統..."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 工作目的地 (Work destinations)** - While work destinations are *involved* in the system, they aren't the *foundation* of it.
* **C: 穩定的生物圈 (Stable biosphere)** - The passage states the system is *harming* the biosphere, not that the biosphere is its foundation.
* **D: 人類演進 (Human evolution)** - Human evolution is mentioned as something the previous state of the biosphere supported, but it doesn't form the basis of the traffic system itself.



"
環繞原子核的粒子具有哪種電荷？,"The correct answer is **C: 負電荷**.

The text states: ""電子則具有負電荷"" (electrons have a negative charge).  The question asks about the charge of particles *orbiting* the nucleus, which are electrons."
原子核由哪些粒子組成？,"The correct answer is **A: 質子和中子**.

The passage explicitly states: ""原子核由中子和質子兩種粒子組成."" (The nucleus is composed of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.)
"
根據文章，下列哪個是五位元二進制的例子？,"The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states a bit can only be 0 or 1.**
* **""Five-bit binary"" means a sequence of five digits, each of which is either a 0 or a 1.**

Let's look at each option:

*   **A: 1010** - This is only four bits long.
*   **B: 12001** - This includes the number '2', which is not a valid bit.
*   **C: 10010** - This is five digits long, and each digit is either 0 or 1.
*   **D: 110101** - This is six bits long.



"
二進位數也被稱為什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 位元**.

The passage specifically states: ""這些數字被稱為二進位數位，或電腦術語所稱的**位元**。"" (These numbers are called binary digits, or **bits** as they are known in computer terms.)
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為學生寫部落格的主要好處？,"The correct answer is **B: 減少來自同儕的批評 (Reducing peer criticism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the opposite of option B.** It says students *become* more careful with their writing *to avoid* criticism from their readers (who are often their peers).  The existence of readers and the potential for criticism are presented as a *driving force* for improvement, not a reduction of criticism.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: 改善文法與寫作能力 (Improving grammar and writing skills):** The passage directly states blogs help improve writing skills (""students generally change this"" referring to initial carelessness with grammar and spelling).
* **C: 拓展對周圍環境的認識 (Expanding knowledge of the surrounding world):** The passage states blogging ""forces students to learn more about the world around them.""
* **D: 增進持續學習的渴望 (Increasing a desire for continued learning):** The passage says blogging ""inspires students to become more informed and engaged"" and extends learning beyond the classroom.

Therefore, only option B is *not* a benefit mentioned in the text.
"
寫部落格的哪個方面被引用為學生提高寫作能力的動力？,"The correct answer is **B: 避免批評的慾望 (The desire to avoid criticism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""由於學生通常是最挑剔的讀者，因此部落客作者們會開始努力加強寫作以避免被批評。"" (Because students are often the most discerning readers, blogger authors will start to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.) This directly links the desire to avoid criticism as a motivator for improved writing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 頻繁回應網路上的材料 (Frequent response to online materials):** While the passage mentions responding to online materials as a way to enhance analytical skills, it doesn’t frame it as the primary driver for *improving writing*.
*   **C: 維持他們受眾的興趣 (Maintaining their audience's interest):** Maintaining audience interest is mentioned as a reason students become more informed, but not directly as a driver for better writing.
*   **D: 合作的需要 (The need for collaboration):** Collaboration is presented as a benefit of blogging, not as the force that initially pushes students to improve their writing.



"
以下哪一項並非非同步交流對學生的好處？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 隨時面對面與教師接觸 (constant face-to-face contact with teachers)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that asynchronous communication *reduces* the need to wait for the next face-to-face meeting. It doesn't offer *constant* face-to-face contact. Instead, it allows for questions to be submitted and answered within a reasonable timeframe, which is different.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits mentioned in the text:

*   **A: 使用網際網路作為資源 (using the internet as a resource):** The passage explicitly states that the internet allows learners to access information anytime.
*   **C: 靈活的工作時間 (flexible work time):**  The text says asynchronous communication leads to more flexible work hours due to fewer time constraints.
*   **D: 步調控制 (pace control):** The passage highlights that asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace and control the speed of information delivery.



"
根據文章，以下非同步交流的哪個方面對學生並不彈性？,"The correct answer is **D: 網際網路使用 (Internet use)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *availability* of information through the internet is constant (""無時無刻都能取得資訊""). This doesn't mean the *use* of the internet itself is flexible. Students need access to the internet to participate in asynchronous communication – it's a prerequisite, not something that adapts to them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 學習步調 (Learning pace):** The passage explicitly says asynchronous communication *allows* students to learn at their own pace (""按照自己的步調學習"").
*   **B: 工作時間 (Work time):** The passage mentions fewer time constraints leading to more flexible work times (""工作時間可以更加靈活"").
*   **C: 教材 (Materials):** The passage states students can control the speed of information presented, implying flexibility in *how* they encounter the materials.



"
文中沒有提到以下何者為中世紀城堡的相關事物？,"The correct answer is **D: 騎士**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **地牢坑 (Dungeon pits):** ""感受到來自地牢坑裡的恐懼氣息。""
    * **馬上長槍比武 (Jousting):** ""馬上長槍比武、宴會...""
    * **騎士精神 (Chivalry):** ""...亞瑟王時代騎士精神...""

* **騎士 (Knights)** are *implied* through the mention of chivalry and jousting, but the passage doesn't specifically *mention* knights themselves as a feature *of* the castles. The passage talks *about* what castles make you think of – things like knights, not the knights themselves being a part of the castle structure or purpose.

Therefore, **D** is the only option not directly stated as a related thing to medieval castles in the text."
文中沒有提到以下何者為城堡遺址中聞到的味道或聽到的聲音？,"The correct answer is **C: 宴會**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...almost hear the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, feel the chill of fear rising from the dungeon pits."" This confirms the presence of fear and hoof sounds.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""...images of jousting, feasting, and the chivalry of the age of King Arthur."" While feasting/banquets (宴會) are *associated* with castles in imagination, the text doesn't say you'd smell or hear them *at the site itself*.
* **The question asks what isn't mentioned as a sound or smell *at the site*.** Therefore, banquets/feasts is the correct answer.

"
以下哪一項是對柯比莫斯洛城堡的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **B: 國家一直以來都很和平，因此建造城堡時，僅需最低程度的防禦工事**

Here's why:

* The passage states that in the 1480s, when Sir Hastings began building the castle, the country was ""relatively peaceful"" and only needed defense against ""small groups of roaming plunderers."" This directly supports the idea that minimal defenses were sufficient, and therefore built.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 城堡的厚牆是由黑斯廷斯爵士所要求的** - The passage explicitly states the walls were *thin*, not thick.
* **C: 城堡並非當時典型的建築物** - The passage says it *was* typical, describing it as a fortified dwelling, not a true castle.
* **D: 它是為了承受長時間和猛攻所建造的** -  The passage states the opposite – its large windows and thin walls wouldn’t withstand a long siege.



"
就文中所述當時的柯比莫斯洛城堡而言，以下哪項描述為非典型的建築特徵？,"The correct answer is **B: 為承受攻擊所建的地基**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the castle had ""thin walls"" and ""large glass windows""** which wouldn't withstand a prolonged attack. This indicates it *wasn't* built to withstand serious assaults, meaning its foundations wouldn't have been designed for that purpose either.
* The passage explicitly states it was more of a ""defended home"" than a true castle, and built during a relatively peaceful time when only small raids were expected. This further supports that it wouldn't have been built to withstand heavy attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are *typical* according to the passage:

* **A: 大窗戶 (Large windows):**  The passage *specifically* mentions large glass windows.
* **C: 防禦工事比某些城堡要少 (Fewer defenses than some castles):** The passage says it was more of a home with defenses, implying weaker defenses than a true castle.
* **D: 薄牆 (Thin walls):** The passage *specifically* mentions thin walls.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項最有益於準備新賽季的跑者？,"The correct answer is **D: 利用健身房鍛鍊上半身**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""冬天適度的越野長跑，加上強化上身的體操訓練，是為跑季準備的最佳方式.""  This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 夏天練習越野長跑** - The passage specifically mentions *winter* off-season training, not summer.
* **B: 著重於培養速度的訓練** - The passage argues that speed is *less* important with the increased distance; endurance is key.
* **C: 在三分鐘內跑完** - The passage doesn't mention a specific time goal or focus on achieving a certain speed, only the importance of endurance.



"
根據文章，以下哪個對於一流的半英里賽跑者來說最重要？,"The correct answer is **B: 培養耐力勝過速度 (Developing endurance over speed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""由於跑步距離從四分之一英里改為半英里，速度的重要性變得越來越低，耐力變為絕對必要的條件."" (Because the running distance has changed from a quarter mile to half a mile, the importance of speed has decreased, and endurance has become absolutely necessary.)
* It also notes that even fast runners *must* build endurance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在冬季鍛煉越野長跑 (Exercising long-distance cross-country in winter):** While the passage *suggests* this is a good preparation method, it doesn't state it's the *most* important thing.
* **C: 計時兩分鐘內跑完 (Finishing within two minutes):**  The passage uses the two-minute mark as an example of a fast runner's existing speed, but doesn't make it a requirement for success in the half-mile.
* **D: 培養速度勝過耐力 (Developing speed over endurance):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage argues. The passage specifically states endurance is *more* important.



"
對於一位運動員來說，以下哪個不能單靠營養習慣來實現？,"The correct answer is **C: 頂尖成績 (Top performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states explicitly: ""僅攝取適當的營養並無法造就頂尖的成績 (Simply taking adequate nutrition cannot create top performance)."" It acknowledges that nutrition *influences* performance but isn't the sole factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 提高表現 (Improve performance):** The passage says nutrition can *help* improve performance.
*   **B: 增加樂趣 (Increase enjoyment):** The passage directly states nutrition can *enhance* enjoyment.
*   **D: 整體健康 (Overall health):** The passage states nutrition *significantly impacts* overall health.

Therefore, **頂尖成績 (Top performance)** is the only outcome the passage claims nutrition *cannot* achieve on its own."
根據文章，以下哪個不被建議作為年輕運動員在運動中找到更多樂趣的方法？,"The correct answer is **B: 持續造就頂尖成績 (Continuously achieving top performance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""維持健康的能量平衡、遵守真正有效的飲水習慣，並全面了解補充營養品，都能幫助運動員改進運動成績、提升運動樂趣."" (Maintaining a healthy energy balance, adhering to truly effective hydration habits, and fully understanding nutritional supplements can help athletes improve athletic performance *and increase enjoyment*.)
* **The passage also states:** ""僅攝取適當的營養並無法造就頂尖的成績"" (Simply consuming adequate nutrition does not create top performance).  This implies striving for *only* top performance isn't the key to enjoyment, but rather the practices *alongside* nutrition.

Therefore, while good nutrition, hydration, and energy balance contribute to enjoyment, the passage doesn't suggest that *solely* focusing on achieving top performance will increase an athlete's enjoyment. In fact, it subtly suggests the opposite – focusing on the fundamentals of health is what leads to enjoyment, and performance is a *result* of that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 攝取適當的營養 (Consuming adequate nutrition):** Explicitly mentioned as helping with enjoyment.
* **C: 有效的飲水習慣 (Effective hydration habits):** Explicitly mentioned as helping with enjoyment.
* **D: 維持健康的能量平衡 (Maintaining a healthy energy balance):** Explicitly mentioned as helping with enjoyment.

根據文章，為什麼中長跑跑者可能會購買更昂貴的設備？,"The correct answer is **A: 他們的個人喜好 (Their personal preference)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""即使產品無法提供真正的好處，運動員仍偏好使用某產品。"" (Even if products don't offer real benefits, athletes still *prefer* to use a certain product.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 有公認的好處 (Recognized benefits):** The passage explicitly says the benefits are often nonexistent.
* **C: 它將大大影響他們的成績 (It will significantly affect their performance):** The passage says the impact is minimal or nonexistent.
* **D: 對周圍低價設備有誤解 (Misunderstandings about cheaper equipment):** While the passage *mentions* misconceptions, it doesn't say these are the reason for buying expensive equipment, but rather that the expensive equipment doesn't actually perform better. The driving force is preference, not a misunderstanding.



"
根據文章，中長跑跑者需要什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 非常少的設備**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""中長跑是一種相對花費較少的運動項目，用以參加此項競技所需的裝備極少"" (Long-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, requiring very little equipment to participate in it).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 很多裝備 (A lot of equipment):** The passage directly contradicts this, stating equipment needs are *minimal*.
* **B: 知名的運動背景 (A famous sports background):** The passage doesn't mention anything about needing a background.
* **D: 大量的金錢 (A lot of money):** The passage says it's a *relatively inexpensive* sport.



"
誰發現了核磁共振？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 布洛赫和珀塞爾 (Bloch and Purcell)**.

The text explicitly states: ""核磁共振 (NMR) 的物理現象，該現像是由菲利克斯‧布洛赫（史丹佛大學）和愛德華‧珀塞爾（哈佛大學）在 1930 年代發現的。"" (The physical phenomenon called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University)).
"
哪一年授予第一項磁振造影的專利？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Four years after [Damadian's discovery], he was granted a patent, which was the first patent in the field of MRI."" Since the discovery was in 1970, the patent was granted in 1974.
"
根據文章，為了解讀他人的身體動作，人類應對什麼有強大的理解力？,"The correct answer is **B: 意圖 (Intentions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...the ability to understand others' **intentions** is crucial. It allows us to disambiguate the ambiguous meanings of bodily movements.""  The example of breaking a car window directly illustrates how understanding *why* someone is doing something (their intention - stealing vs. unlocking) drastically changes how we interpret their actions and judge them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 渴望 (Desires):** While understanding desires is part of understanding people, the passage focuses specifically on *intentions* as the key to interpreting actions.
* **C: 信仰 (Beliefs):** Beliefs are important, but the passage highlights intention as the driver of action interpretation.
* **D: 感知 (Perceptions):**  Perceptions are what *others* experience, but understanding their intentions is what helps *us* interpret *their* actions.



"
根據文章，理解意圖有助於人類做什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除身體動作背後的不確定性**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""這個能力讓我們得以釐清身體動作可能帶有的含糊意義。"" (This ability allows us to clarify the ambiguous meaning behind physical actions.)  The example of breaking a car window illustrates this – the *intent* (stealing vs. regaining access to one's own car) clarifies the meaning of the action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 預測渴望 (Predicting desires):** While understanding intent *can* inform us about desires, the passage focuses on clarifying actions, not directly predicting desires.
* **C: 無偏見地看待其他人 (Viewing others without bias):** The passage doesn't claim understanding intent eliminates bias, it just helps us understand *what* is happening.  Judgment still comes into play (as the example shows with different consequences).
* **D: 揣摩他人心思 (Reading minds):**  The passage states humans are good at ""揣摩他人心思"" generally, but the specific benefit of understanding intent is about deciphering actions, not general mind-reading.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項是人工智慧主要目的的正確總結？,"The correct answer is **D: 任務自動化**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""人工智慧研究的內容之一，是製造出可自動執行需以智慧行為完成任務的機器。"" (One aspect of AI research is creating machines that can automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.)

While planning, speech recognition, and scheduling are *examples* of what AI can *do*, the overarching purpose is to **automate tasks** that typically require human intelligence.

Therefore, option D best summarizes the main purpose of AI as described in the text.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項經常與人工智慧聯想一起？,"The correct answer is **C: 科幻小說 (Science Fiction)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Although artificial intelligence has strong science fiction connotations..."" This directly links AI with science fiction.

While options A, B, and D are *examples* of what AI does (as listed in the passage), the question asks what is *frequently associated* with AI, and the passage clearly states that's science fiction.
"
根據文章，聚斂性思考模式的人具有以下哪一項優勢？,"The correct answer is **D: 記憶模式**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""這種思考模式的人擅邏輯，他們能記住模式、解決問題、進行科學測試。"" (These thinkers are good at logic, they can **remember patterns**, solve problems, and conduct scientific tests.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 找出問題的多個正確答案** - The passage explicitly states convergent thinking focuses on *one* correct answer.
*   **B: 將新技術應用於問題** - The passage mentions *re-applying existing* techniques, not necessarily new ones.
*   **C: 花時間解決問題** - The passage states convergent thinking is focused on being *quick and logical*.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不被認為是聚斂性思考模式的重點？,"The correct answer is **B: 花時間 (Spending time)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that convergent thinking focuses on being **fast**, logical, and precise. ""Spending time"" implies a more deliberate and exploratory process, which is characteristic of *divergent* thinking, not convergent thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: 了解只有一個正確答案 (Understanding there is only one correct answer)** - The passage directly states ""這種心態最重要的特點就是只有一個正確答案"" (The most important characteristic of this mindset is that there is only one correct answer).
*   **C: 辨認事實 (Identifying facts)** - The passage mentions ""辨別事實"" (identifying facts) as a focus of this thinking style.
*   **D: 收集資訊 (Collecting information)** - The passage includes ""收集資訊"" (collecting information) as part of convergent thinking.

"
根據文章，以下哪一項不被認為是微表情？,"The correct answer is **D: 豎起大拇指 (thumbs up)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *fleeting facial movements* lasting only milliseconds.** These are microexpressions – very brief, involuntary displays of emotion.
* **A: 說話時眼神飄忽 (eyes darting while speaking)** – This *can* be a microexpression indicating discomfort or deception.
* **B: 皺眉 (frowning)** – This is a clear facial expression showing emotion and can be a microexpression.
* **C: 快速眨眼 (rapid blinking)** – Can be a microexpression indicating stress or nervousness.
* **D: 豎起大拇指 (thumbs up)** – This is a deliberate, sustained gesture, not a fleeting, involuntary facial movement. It's a consciously made signal, not a microexpression.

Therefore, thumbs up doesn't fit the description of microexpressions given in the text."
有關微表情解讀的說法，以下哪個敘述不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 除了臉部表情，也可以解讀語言**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses *exclusively* on facial expressions (microexpressions) and how they reveal truthfulness.** It discusses interpreting subtle facial movements, not language.
* **A is correct:** The passage explicitly states ""錄影的運用已為解讀微表情...帶來重大的發現"" (The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting microexpressions).
* **B is correct:** The passage mentions the belief that ""可以透過正確解讀微表情，來偵測一個人是否在說謊"" (one can detect whether a person is lying through correct interpretation of microexpressions).
* **D is correct:** The passage talks about sensing a speaker's ""誠意"" (sincerity), which is directly related to assessing trustworthiness or credibility.

Therefore, the only option not supported by the text is that microexpression interpretation extends to understanding language."
以下哪項文藝復興的成果變得更重要？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 文本回憶 (Text recall)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that pressure shifts *from* individual memories *to* the ability to recall texts. It highlights that the way knowledge is acquired and spread changes, and that remembering *texts* becomes more central.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 個別回憶 (Individual recall):** The passage states this becomes *less* important.
*   **B: 知識傳播 (Knowledge dissemination):** While knowledge dissemination *is* affected by the Renaissance, the passage focuses specifically on *how* knowledge is stored and retrieved *within* an individual, making text recall the core change.
*   **D: 獲得資訊 (Gaining information):** This is a broad concept. The passage doesn't say acquiring information is more important, but rather *how* that information is processed and remembered.



"
以下哪項文藝復興的成果不再受到重視？,"The correct answer is **A: 個別回憶 (Individual recall)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that pressure *no longer* exists on individual memories. Instead, the focus shifts to the ability to recall *texts*. This means individual, rote memorization became less important during the Renaissance as knowledge acquisition methods changed. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 獲得知識 (Gaining knowledge)**: The passage states knowledge acquisition *changed*, not that it became less important.
*   **C: 文本回憶 (Text recall)**: The passage emphasizes that the ability to recall texts *increased* in importance.
*   **D: 資訊散播 (Information dissemination)**: The passage specifically mentions that the ways of learning and *spreading* knowledge changed significantly.



"
以下哪一項不反映使用網際網路維持人際關係的動機？,"The correct answer is **C: 研究旅行**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on motivations related to communication and social connection.** It specifically mentions ""socialization,"" ""personal involvement,"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as reasons people use the internet.
* **A: 商業網絡 (Business networking)** -  This *is* a form of maintaining relationships, albeit professional ones.
* **B: 與家人保持聯繫 (Staying in touch with family)** - This is a direct example of maintaining interpersonal relationships.
* **D: 結識新朋友 (Making new friends)** - This is about forming *new* interpersonal relationships.
* **C: 研究旅行 (Researching travel)** - While you might *share* travel plans with others, the act of researching travel itself isn't fundamentally about maintaining or building relationships. It's about information gathering.

Therefore, researching travel is the only option that doesn't directly align with the passage's focus on the internet as a tool for interpersonal connection.



"
以下哪一項不反映因個人參與而使用網際網路的動機？,"The correct answer is **D: 管理財務**.

Here's why:

* **Personal Engagement** (as defined in the passage through Eighmey & McCord's research) refers to a deeper level of connection and involvement beyond simply *using* the internet for information. It's about building relationships and being actively involved in communities or experiences.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect personal engagement:

* **A: 查閱食譜 (Checking recipes):** While seemingly simple, this could be part of engaging in a hobby, sharing creations, or participating in online food communities.
* **B: 線上討論區發文 (Posting in online forums):** This is *directly* about actively participating and engaging with others.
* **C: 搜尋保健品 (Searching for health supplements):** This could be motivated by actively taking control of one's health, joining health-focused communities, and seeking personalized information – all forms of engagement.

* **D: 管理財務 (Managing finances):** This is a primarily *utilitarian* function. It's about completing a task efficiently, not about building relationships or personal connection. While useful, it's less about *engagement* and more about *functionality*.



Therefore, **managing finances** is the least likely to be motivated by personal engagement, based on the information provided in the passage."
西歐什麼時候停止重度依賴外來影響，並開始發展自己的風格？,"The correct answer is **A: 中世紀末期左右 (Around the late Middle Ages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""中世紀末期，西歐開始發展獨特的風格 (Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own unique style).""  This directly answers the question of when Western Europe moved away from heavy reliance on outside influences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 拜占庭時期 (Byzantine period):** The passage states that *early* Gothic style was *influenced* by Byzantine culture, not that Western Europe stopped being influenced during that time.
*   **C: 中世紀後大約 25 年 (About 25 years after the Middle Ages):** This is not stated in the passage.
*   **D: 11 世紀期間 (During the 11th century):** The passage says that Gothic style reached a peak in the 10th-11th centuries *while still being heavily influenced* by the East. It doesn't indicate a shift to unique Western styles at this time."
使用鈕扣來固定衣服是哪個時期的產物？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 十字軍東征 (Crusades)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states ""當時的一大進展，就是十字軍成員開始用釦子固定衣服"" (A major advancement at the time was that members of the Crusades began to use buttons to fasten their clothes). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 哥德時期 (Gothic period):**  While buttons *became* used during the Gothic period, the passage states the *origin* of their use was with the Crusaders.
* **B: 拜占庭時代 (Byzantine period):** The passage mentions Byzantine culture *influencing* early Gothic clothing, but doesn't say they used buttons.
* **D: 中世紀 (Middle Ages):** Too broad. The passage pinpoints the Crusaders specifically.



"
根據文章，以下哪個被認為是環境問題可行的長期解決方案？,"The correct answer is **C: 確定問題的原因**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while actions like environmental activism (B) and reducing waste (A, implied by ""奢侈生活方式"") are helpful, they are only temporary fixes (""頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳""). The passage emphasizes the need to ""find the root of the problem and solve them thoroughly"" for a lasting solution.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: 抵制的奢侈生活方式 (Resisting a luxurious lifestyle):** While reducing waste is mentioned as part of the problem, the passage doesn't single out resisting luxury as *the* long-term solution.
*   **B: 行動主義 (Activism):** The passage points out that activism is a temporary solution, like treating symptoms.
*   **D: 成為環保運動的盟友 (Becoming an ally of the environmental movement):**  Similar to activism, being an ally doesn't address the fundamental causes.

The passage clearly states that understanding and addressing the *root causes* is crucial for a lasting solution, making **C** the most accurate answer."
根據文章，以下哪個解決方案不被視為環境問題的症狀治療？,"正確答案是 **B: 徹底解決問題的根本原因**。

文章明確指出，參與環保運動、以更環保的方式生活，甚至成為社運人士，都像是「頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳」的**症狀治療**，只能提供暫時性的解決方案。

文章強調，要真正解決問題，必須**找到問題的根源，然後徹底解決它們**，這才是根本之道，而不是治療症狀。

因此，選項 B 是文章中提出的，不被視為症狀治療的解決方案。

其他選項都與文章中描述的「頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳」的症狀治療相符：

*   A: 參與行動主義 - 被視為症狀治療
*   C: 對奢侈生活方式發表意見 - 這是針對問題的表現形式，仍屬於症狀治療
*   D: 以更環保的方式生活 - 也是針對問題的表現形式，屬於症狀治療"
據說歐洲第一場以權力平衡為核心議題而非宗教背景的戰爭發生在哪個國家？,"The correct answer is **D: 西班牙**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""西班牙王位繼承戰爭成為以權力平衡為核心議題的第一場戰爭.""

Therefore, the war centered around the Spanish throne was the first to be driven by power balance concerns, not religious ones.



"
哪場戰爭有時被描述為最後一場「宗教戰爭」？,"The correct answer is **A: 三十年戰爭 (Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...三十年戰爭成為最後一場宗教戰爭."" (Thirty Years' War became the last religious war.)
"
根據文章，以下天主教教會哪個方面未受到詳細審查？,"The correct answer is **B: 是否應修改宗教的主要信條**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on scrutiny of the Catholic Church's *actions* regarding its wealth and power.** It states the church was being examined regarding whether it *followed* its core belief about using wealth to help the poor, and the concentration of power in Rome was questioned.
* **It doesn't mention any debate or examination of whether the *beliefs themselves* (the core tenet about wealth and charity) should be changed.** The issue is about application, not the belief itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 教會內的財富分配是否恰當 (Whether the distribution of wealth within the church was appropriate)** - This is directly addressed – the passage questions if the church was *actually* using its wealth to help the poor as it should.
* **C: 權力集中於教會 (Concentration of power within the church)** - The passage explicitly states the concentration of power in Rome was a point of questioning.
* **D: 是否遵循教會的主要信條 (Whether the church followed its main tenet)** - The entire passage revolves around questioning if the church was adhering to its core belief about helping the poor.



"
根據文章，誰在凡爾賽宮被謀殺？,"The correct answer is **D: 一名衛兵**.

The passage states: ""...一名暴徒成員甚至在驚恐的皇后面前揮舞著王室衛兵的頭顱，該衛兵在在凡爾賽宮被殺."" ( ""...a rioter even waved the head of a royal guard in front of the terrified queen, the guard having been killed at Versailles."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 其中一個市場婦女 (One of the market women)** - The passage says the market women *forced* the move, but doesn't say one was killed.
*   **B: 路易十六 (Louis XVI)** - The passage states Louis XVI was frightened but not killed.
*   **C: 一名暴徒 (A rioter)** - The passage doesn't mention a rioter being killed.



"
暴徒沒有強迫國王和皇后做出以下哪種行為？,"The correct answer is **B: Suddenly leave Versailles**. 

Here's why:

* **The passage states the king and queen were *forced* to move from Versailles to Paris.** This implies it wasn't a sudden decision of their own, but rather a compulsion imposed upon them.
* **A: Open their carriage windows:** The passage explicitly states the mob *forced* them to open the windows.
* **C: Watch the head of a guard:** The passage states a head was waved *in front of* the queen, meaning she was forced to witness it.
* **D: The return trip to Paris:** The passage states they were forced to travel to Paris.

Therefore, the only action not *forced* upon them was the initial decision to leave Versailles. They were compelled to go, but didn't choose it spontaneously.



"
以下哪一項不是英國非傳統海戰的成果？,"正確答案是 **C: 國際法得到了修改**。

以下解釋原因：

* **P段描述英國的海上封鎖雖然違反國際法，但並未導致國際法被修改。** 相反地，英國的行為更像是對國際法的無視，而非修改。
* **A: 德國希望採用類似的戰術** - 正確。 P段明確指出英國的行動讓德國認為他們可以採取同樣的、違反國際法的戰術（無限制潛艇戰）。
* **B: 將無關的船隻置身危險之中** - 正確。 P段提到英國在國際海域佈雷，危害到中立船隻，這表示無關的船隻被置於危險之中。
* **D: 無法獲得關鍵物資** - 正確。 P段說明英國的封鎖策略切斷了德國的軍事及民生物資供應，導致德國無法獲得關鍵物資。

**總結：** P段重點描述英國違反國際法，及其對德國策略的影響，並非國際法本身的修改。
"
以下哪個陳述並未正確描述英國對德國的海上封鎖？,"正確答案是 **D: 它確保中立國的船舶不會受到危害**。

段落中明確指出英國在國際海域佈置水雷，*危害到*中立船隻，因此封鎖並未確保中立國船舶的安全，反而對其造成威脅。

其他選項的描述在段落中都得到了支持：

*   **A: 它違反了國際法** - 段落直接說明封鎖違反了國際法規。
*   **B: 它引發了德國的潛艇戰** - 段落提到德國認為英國的行為沒有招致強烈反彈，所以也採取了無限制潛艇戰。
*   **C: 它中斷了德國的物資流通** - 段落說明封鎖的目的是切斷德國的物資供應。
"
根據文章，哪種人最有可能被診斷出患有多發性硬化症？,"The correct answer is **A: A 32-year-old woman**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states MS is most common in *younger and middle-aged adults*.** 32 falls into this category.
* **The passage specifically states women are *twice as likely* to develop MS compared to men.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A 15-year-old male:** MS is less common in teenagers.
* **C: A 43-year-old male:** While 43 is within the age range, men are less likely to be diagnosed than women.
* **D: A 10-year-old female:** MS is rare in children.



"
根據文章，參與規律活動的人哪方面需要更多協助？,"The correct answer is **A: 負面疼痛感知 (Negative pain perception)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""那些進行規律活動的人在對於疼痛的負面感知即慢性疼痛及一般物理性動作所造成的不適感之間的區別，需要更多的協助。"" This directly translates to ""Those who engage in regular activity need more help with distinguishing between negative perceptions of pain – namely chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical activity.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 下背部 (Lower back):** The passage discusses lower back pain *generally*, but doesn't say participants need more help *with their lower backs*.
* **C: 抑鬱 (Depression):** The passage mentions depression as a mediator, but not as something participants *need help with* if they are regularly active.
* **D: 恐懼 (Fear):** Similar to depression, fear is a mediator, not a specific area needing assistance for active individuals.



"
根據文章，擊劍通常是如何進行的？,"The correct answer is **D: 以決鬥形式進行 (in a duel format)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這種運動主要以決鬥模式進行，由一名擊劍選手對決另一名選手"" (This sport is mainly conducted in a duel mode, with one fencer facing off against another).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 以現代形式 (in a modern form)** - While true, the passage doesn't focus on *how* it's conducted, just that it's modern.
*   **B: 以大學程度 (at a university level)** - The passage mentions university students participate, but it's not *how* the sport is generally conducted.
*   **C: 以奧林匹克級別 (at an Olympic level)** -  Similarly, the passage mentions the Olympics, but doesn't describe it as the typical way the sport is played.



"
根據文章，以下哪一個是體內中毒最強力的指標？,"The correct answer is **D: 一個處方藥藥瓶 (a prescription drug bottle)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""最好判斷體內中毒的跡象，可能是發現有著已打開的藥物或毒性家用化學物的容器。"" (The best way to judge internal poisoning is to find opened medications or toxic household chemicals.)

While nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms *can* be present with poisoning, the passage notes they are too common to be a direct diagnostic indicator. Finding the container itself is the strongest sign mentioned in the text.
"
根據文章，評估傷者時適當的第一步是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 觀察現場**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""檢查傷者之前，你必須先觀察周邊環境，確保自己的安全."" (Before checking the injured person, you must first observe the surrounding environment and ensure your own safety.) This directly corresponds to observing the scene.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 接近傷者:** The passage says to observe *before* approaching.
* **C: 檢查傷者的位置:** While noting the victim's position is mentioned, it's done *after* the initial safety assessment.
* **D: 等待幫助:** The passage is about *taking* action to help, not waiting.



"
以下哪一個陳述未正確反映檢查傷者的過程？,"The correct answer is **A: 不用擔心自己受傷 (Don't worry about getting injured yourself)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage *specifically* states:** ""If you get injured while trying to help, you may only make things worse."" This directly contradicts the idea of not worrying about your own safety.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct, based on the passage:

* **B: 在傷者面前評估現場 (Assess the scene before approaching the injured person):**  The passage begins by saying you must ""observe the surrounding environment to ensure your own safety.""
* **C: 觀察傷者的位置 (Observe the injured person's position):** The passage says to ""pay attention to the injured person's position.""
* **D: 嘗試注意任何警訊 (Try to notice any signals):** The passage states to ""be alert for any signals.""

Therefore, option A is the only statement that doesn't align with the information provided.
"
法國大革命促使哪些變革對勞工階級產生了重大影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 關注重點從階級轉向才幹**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""各種職缺都開放給所有主動求職的男性，讓最有意願和成就者得以接掌…同樣的情形也發生在軍隊裡，因為他們此時已不用階級來區分軍階，而是以才幹為基準."" This directly indicates a shift in focus from class/birthright to merit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 增加國家的支持度:** While the revolution *might* have eventually led to increased support in some areas, the passage doesn't focus on this outcome for the working class.
* **C: 採納了共和意識形態:** The passage mentions the shift from absolutism to republicanism, but doesn't specifically link this as a *direct* impact *on the laboring classes*. It's a broader political shift.
* **D: 新的度量衡系統:**  The passage mentions the adoption of the metric system, but this isn't specifically presented as a change affecting the working class.



"
法國大革命後，要在軍事和其他職業中取得成功，不太可能以什麼為基準？,"The correct answer is **B: 階級 (Class)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that *after* the revolution, positions (both civilian and military) were no longer based on class, but on merit (""the most willing and capable"") and talent (""not by rank, but by talent"").  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 成就 (Achievement):** The passage explicitly mentions achievement as a key factor for success.
* **C: 野心 (Ambition):** While ambition might be present, it's not highlighted as the *basis* for success.
* **D: 才幹 (Talent):** The passage directly states talent was the basis for military rank.

Therefore, the revolution actively moved *away* from using class as a determinant of success."
根據文章，在已開發國家中，據說哪一項公共服務引起了最多不滿？,"The correct answer is **C: 大眾運輸 (Public Transportation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""幾乎每一個人都抱怨運輸系統 (almost everyone complains about the transportation system)."" It contrasts this with the rarity of complaints about water quality and bridge collapses in developed countries.  Therefore, public transportation is the service identified as generating the most dissatisfaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 水質 (Water Quality)** - The passage says complaints about water quality are *rare*.
*   **B: 橋樑建設 (Bridge Construction)** - The passage also states complaints about bridge collapses are *rare*.
*   **D: 教育 (Education)** - The passage doesn't mention education at all."
根據文章，大眾運輸系統有什麼特點？,"The correct answer is **C: 常常被使用者的抱怨**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""almost everyone complains about the transportation system."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 深受使用者的喜愛 (Deeply liked by users)** - The passage states the *opposite* – people complain about it.
*   **B: 不像水質那麼糟糕 (Not as bad as water quality)** - While the passage compares transportation to water and bridge infrastructure, it doesn't say transportation is *better* than water quality. It just points out fewer complaints about those other systems.
*   **D: 在大多數已開發國家中是免費的 (Free in most developed countries)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the cost of transportation.



"
根據文章，由於難以預測司機的行為，因此難以衡量以下哪個項目？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通流量 (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""The problem is, because it is impossible to predict driving habits with 100% certainty, studying **traffic flow** is very difficult."" 

The other options are related to traffic but aren't directly identified as difficult to measure *because* of unpredictable driver behavior:

*   **A: 交通速度 (Traffic speed)** - Speed is *one* of the features used to *understand* traffic flow, but the passage doesn't say it's difficult to measure speed itself.
*   **B: 道路規劃 (Road planning)** - Road planning is an application of understanding traffic flow, not something inherently difficult to measure due to driver behavior.
*   **C: 道路作業 (Road work)** - Road work is an event that *impacts* traffic flow, but isn't the thing being difficult to measure."
以下哪項工具會用於展現交通流量？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通密度 (Traffic Density)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that traffic flow is characterized by three main features: **flow, density, and speed.**  The question asks what *shows* traffic flow, and density is one of the key elements used to define and understand it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 道路作業 (Road Work)** - Road work *affects* traffic flow, but doesn't *show* it.
*   **B: 司機行為 (Driver Behavior)** - Driver behavior is *part* of what makes traffic flow difficult to predict, but it isn't a tool to *show* the flow itself.
*   **C: 道路設計 (Road Design)** - Road design *influences* traffic flow, but is not something that exhibits or demonstrates the flow itself.



"
赫雪和蔡司用什麼來植入他們的 DNA？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 病毒**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hershey and Chase utilized bacteriophages, or viruses, to introduce their DNA into bacteria.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 放射性磷 (Radioactive phosphorus)** - While they *used* radioactive phosphorus, it was to label the DNA, not the method of introduction.
* **B: 遺傳物質 (Genetic material)** - This is what they were *studying*, not what they used to deliver it.
* **C: 放射性硫 (Radioactive sulfur)** -  Similar to radioactive phosphorus, this was used for labeling, not the delivery mechanism.



"
突變是否能夠傳遞給後代，取決於以下哪一個因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 細胞是否為生殖系細胞 (whether the cell is a germline cell)**.

The passage specifically states: ""只有生殖細胞系細胞中的突變會遺傳給子女 (Only mutations in germline cells will be passed on to offspring)"".  This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 基因物質的重要性 (the importance of the genetic material):** While important for the *effect* of a mutation, it doesn't determine *if* it's passed down.
* **C: 突變的類型 (the type of mutation):** The type of mutation impacts the effect, not necessarily inheritance.
* **D: 突變是否會導致細胞死亡 (whether the mutation causes cell death):** Cell death prevents inheritance, but the initial determining factor is where the mutation occurred.  If it's in a non-germline cell, it won't be passed down regardless of whether it causes death.



"
根據文章所提供的資訊，突變的各種不同效果不依賴以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 有多少遺傳物質受到影響**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the effects of a mutation *depend* on:**
    * **The type of mutation (D)** - ""突變的種類""
    * **The importance of the affected genetic material (C)** - ""受影響遺傳物質的重要性""
    * **Whether the affected cells are germline cells (B)** - ""受影響細胞是否為生殖系細胞""

* **The passage does *not* mention how the *amount* of genetic material affected influences the effects.** It focuses on *what* genetic material is affected and *where* (germline vs. somatic).

Therefore, the effects of a mutation, according to the passage, do *not* rely on how much genetic material is affected.
"
以下哪個不是古代文化飼養山羊的原因？,"The correct answer is **C: 提供陪伴 (Provide companionship)**.

The passage states ancient cultures domesticated goats for milk, wool, meat, and hides. It doesn't mention companionship as a reason. 

Here's why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

*   **A: 提供肉品 (Provide meat):** The passage explicitly states goats were raised for meat.
*   **B: 幫助放牧 (Help with grazing):** While not directly stated, the passage mentions goats were grazed on hillsides and pastures, implying they were used for utilizing grazing lands.
*   **D: 提供牛奶 (Provide milk):** The passage specifically mentions goats were raised for milk.



"
高爾夫球是用極少數的什麼達到目標？,"The correct answer is **B: 桿數**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...由以最低桿數，也就是最少揮桿次數進洞的球員贏得比賽."" This directly links winning to having the lowest *桿數* (number of strokes).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 球數** - The number of balls is not the determining factor.
*   **C: 時間** - While speed of play is a consideration, it's not how the winner is decided.
*   **D: 洞數** - All players play the same number of holes (18). It's *how* they play those holes that matters.



"
在高爾夫球場上，哪裡的草修剪得比較短？,"The correct answer is **B: 在果嶺上 (On the green)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""球洞周圍的草割得較短，稱為果嶺 (The grass around the hole is cut shorter, called the green).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在第十八洞 (On the 18th hole):** While the game ends on the 18th hole, the passage doesn't say the grass is specifically shorter there.
* **C: 在第一個洞 (On the first hole):** The passage mentions starting on the first hole, but not about the grass length.
* **D: 在球場前半段 (On the first half of the course):** The passage doesn't indicate any difference in grass length across the course.



"
實驗的典型目的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除一個或多個可能的假設**.

The passage explicitly states: ""實驗是能消除一個或多個假設的測試"".  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 理解世界的運作方式:** This is the *overall* goal of science, but not the specific purpose of an *experiment*.
* **C: 提出問題:** Experiments are often *designed* to answer questions, but they don't primarily *propose* them. Observation and inquiry do that.
* **D: 引領科學研究:**  Experiments *contribute* to guiding research, but aren't the sole driver. The scientific method as a whole guides research.



"
根據文章，以下何者不能幫助引領科學研究？,"The correct answer is **A: 只靠科學方法**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""But experimental method is not the only one, experiments are tests to eliminate one or more hypotheses, asking questions and making observations can also lead scientific research."" This means that scientific research isn't *just* driven by the scientific method itself, but also by observations and questioning. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 進行觀察 (Making observations)** - The passage explicitly states observations *can* lead scientific research.
* **C: 排除可能的假設 (Eliminating possible hypotheses)** - The passage says experiments are ""tests to eliminate one or more hypotheses,"" making this a valid way to conduct research.
* **D: 進行實驗 (Conducting experiments)** - The passage states experiments are a part of the scientific method and can lead research.

Therefore, relying *solely* on the scientific method (without observation or questioning) is not sufficient to lead scientific research, according to the passage."
根據文章，以下哪個對龍捲風的陳述不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 大多數龍捲風持續超過三小時**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""龍捲風之中最猛烈的 2% 能持續超過 3 小時."" (The most intense 2% of tornadoes last more than 3 hours.) This means *only* 2% last that long, not the majority.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 龍捲風能夠摧毀周圍的一切** (Tornadoes can destroy everything in their path) - This is directly stated in the first sentence.
* **B: 龍捲風影響的範圍比其他風暴小** (Tornadoes affect a smaller area than other storms) - This is also stated in the first sentence.
* **D: 有些龍捲風的風速可以達到每小時 300 英里** (Some tornadoes have winds up to 300 miles per hour) - The passage mentions wind speeds up to 480 kilometers per hour (300 miles per hour).



"
根據文章，以下哪個陳述正確描述了大多數龍捲風？,"The correct answer is **D: 它們能夠將樹木從地上拔起**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""龍捲風能將樹連根拔起..."" (Dragon whirlwinds can uproot trees...) This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它們通常持續超過三小時** (They usually last more than three hours) - The passage says *only the most intense 2%* of tornadoes last over 3 hours.
* **B: 它們能夠產生每小時約480英里的風速** (They can produce wind speeds of about 480 miles per hour) - The passage states this is the speed of the *most intense* tornadoes, not most tornadoes.
* **C: 它們影響的範圍比其他風暴大** (Their impact range is greater than other storms) - The passage states the *opposite* - that tornadoes have a *smaller* impact range than other storms.



"
以下哪個是人類在 16 世紀開始做的事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 製造望遠鏡 (Manufacturing telescopes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""But the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 使用透鏡 (Using lenses):** The passage states humans have been doing this for *thousands of years*.
* **B: 放大物體 (Magnifying objects):** Humans have been magnifying objects with lenses for *thousands of years*.
* **C: 製造透鏡 (Manufacturing lenses):**  Similar to A and B, lens manufacturing has been happening for *thousands of years*.

The question asks what humans *began* to do in the 16th century, and the passage clearly identifies that as making telescopes.
"
人類使用透鏡放大物體已經有多久了？,"The correct answer is **C: 數千年 (Several millennia)**.

The passage states ""人類幾千年來一直在製造透鏡，並使用它的放大功能 (Humans have been making lenses and using their magnifying power for millennia)"".  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 一千年 (One thousand years):** While a long time, the passage specifies *several* millennia, meaning more than one thousand.
* **B: 自 16 世紀末開始 (Since the late 16th century):** This is when the *telescope* was invented, not when humans began using lenses for magnification.
* **D: 自 16 世紀初開始 (Since the early 16th century):**  Similar to B, this refers to the telescope, not general lens use.



"
根據文章，關於穆罕默德的靈性修行或價值觀，他的洞穴說明了什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: He valued peace and solitude.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states Muhammad sought isolation:** He regularly went to the cave ""to meditate,"" and it was ""completely cut off from the world."" It was also ""not easy to find"" even if people knew of it.
* **Emphasis on separation:** The text highlights the cave's remoteness and how little of the outside world could be seen or heard within it. This strongly suggests he sought a peaceful, solitary environment for his spiritual practice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 外界嘈雜聲可以幫助冥想 (Outside noise can help with meditation):** The passage emphasizes the *lack* of noise and the isolation as key features of the cave.
* **C: 他需要的獨處時間非常少 (He needed very little alone time):** The passage directly contradicts this – he *regularly* went for extended periods of solitude.
* **D: 他渴望被看到和被聽到 (He desired to be seen and heard):** The cave’s remote and hidden location suggests the opposite; he actively *avoided* being seen and heard.



"
根據文章，鐵最早是用來做什麼的？,"The correct answer is **B: 馬車軌道 (carriage rails)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""漸漸地，人們發現若鋪上鐵條，軌道效率較高。 這成為常見作法，但鐵會使馬車的木輪上出現更多磨損。""  This directly indicates iron was initially used for the *rails* (軌道) themselves, to improve efficiency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 鐵路枕木 (railroad ties/sleepers):** While the passage mentions early use of supports to fix the rails, it doesn't say iron was used for those initially.
*   **C: 車輪 (wheels):** The passage states iron wheels *replaced* wooden wheels, meaning iron wasn't the first application.
*   **D: 鐵軌 (rail tracks):** Although close, ""馬車軌道"" is more accurate as it specifies what the tracks were initially for – carriages. The term ""鐵軌"" is a broader description.



"
根據文章，為什麼木輪被鐵輪取代？,"The correct answer is **D: 木輪受軌道上的鐵條磨損 (Wood wheels were worn down by the iron strips on the track)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""但鐵會使馬車的木輪上出現更多磨損 (But iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts).""  This directly explains why iron wheels were eventually adopted – to solve the problem of the wood wheels being damaged by the iron rails.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 鐵輪能提高馬匹的速度 (Iron wheels increased the speed of the horses)** - The passage doesn't say iron wheels increased speed, only that the original tracks were faster than the roads.
*   **B: 鐵輪被認為更有效率 (Iron wheels were considered more efficient)** - While the move to iron rails *increased* efficiency, the passage doesn't say the *wheels* themselves were considered more efficient.
*   **C: 鐵輪能夠處理更大的負載 (Iron wheels could handle larger loads)** - The passage doesn't mention load capacity as a reason for the change in wheels."
根據文章，是什麼塑造了浪漫主義時期的個體？,"The correct answer is **B: 地理**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: **""在浪漫主義的脈絡中，地理環境塑造了個體...""** (In the context of Romanticism, the geographical environment shaped the individual...). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 法律 (Laws):** The passage actually contrasts laws *against* the influence of geography, stating customs were *better* than arbitrarily imposed laws.
*   **C: 風俗習慣 (Customs):** While customs *resulted* from the geographical influence, they were not the initial shaping force.
*   **D: 文化 (Culture):** Culture is a broad term and, in this context, is a product of the geographical environment and the customs that arise from it. The passage highlights geography as the primary shaper.



"
以下哪個陳述不反映科技決定論的普遍概念？ ,"正確答案是 **A: 科技對社會的影響是社會條件所決定的**。

**原因：**

科技決定論的核心概念，如文章中所述，是科技*影響*社會，而非社會*決定*科技的影響。 科技決定論認為科技發展有其內在邏輯和動力，會塑造社會的發展，而不是由社會條件來決定科技的影響。

讓我們看看其他選項為什麼是錯誤的：

* **B: 科技的發展不受文化的影響** - 這符合科技決定論的觀點，因為科技決定論認為科技發展主要受自身邏輯驅動，而非文化因素。
* **C: 科技對社會具有內在的影響** - 這也是科技決定論的核心，認為科技本身就具有塑造社會的力量。
* **D: 科技發展不基於政治影響力** - 科技決定論傾向於認為科技發展較少受到政治因素干預，強調其自主性。

**總之，選項A直接反駁了科技決定論的中心思想，因此是正確答案。**
"
根據文章，以下哪個選項與拉弓無關？,"The correct answer is **A: 柔和的聲音 (Soft sound)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""上弓記號通常代表的是比較輕柔的聲響 (up bows typically represent a softer sound).""  This means soft sound is associated with *up bows*, not down bows (which are used for pulling the bow).
* **The passage states:** 下弓表示您應該從弓根（您的手握住弓的地方）開始拉弓 (Down bows mean you should start pulling the bow from the frog – where you hold the bow).""
* **The passage states:** 下弓記號則代表比較強烈又比較堅定的聲響 (Down bows typically represent a stronger, more assertive sound).""
* **The passage states:** 下弓標記長得像訂書針 (Down bows look like staples).""

Therefore, a soft sound is linked to an *up bow*, while the question asks about what is *not* related to pulling the bow (down bow).



"
根據文章，以下何者與柔和的聲音有關？,"The correct answer is **C: 像 V 字形的痕標記**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""上弓記號通常代表的是比較輕柔的聲響..."" and ""上弓」標記長得像 V...""  Therefore, the V-shaped mark (上弓) is associated with a softer sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 下弓標記** - The passage states down bows are *stronger* and *firmer*.
*   **B: 拉弓** - While pulling the bow is part of playing, it doesn't specifically indicate a soft sound. The passage describes *where* to pull (from the frog/hand position) for down bows.
*   **D: 從手握住弓的位置開始** - This describes how to perform a down bow, not the resulting sound quality.



"
化石顯示，手最終適應了以下哪方面的主要用途？,"The correct answer is **A: 操作**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""兩百萬到三百萬年前的手骨化石，顯示從運動到操作，手部功能的轉變。"" (Fossil hand bones from two to three million years ago show a shift in hand function from locomotion to manipulation.)

The passage directly links the fossil evidence to a change *towards* manipulation/operation. The other options describe what hands were used for in the past (weight-bearing, locomotion, knuckle-walking) but not the *change* that the fossils show.
"
以下何者正確描述了黑猩猩的指骨？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 用於負重 (Used for weight-bearing)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""黑猩猩手和腳的尺寸與長度相當，反映了牠們的手在握拳行走時承受重量的作用。"" (Chimpanzees' hands and feet are similar in size, reflecting the role of their hands in bearing weight during knuckle-walking.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 比人類的指骨更直 (Straighter than human finger bones):** The passage states human finger bones are straighter.
*   **B: 手腳的指骨大小不同 (Different sizes of finger bones in hands and feet):** The passage explicitly says chimpanzee hand and foot digits are *the same* size.
*   **D: 主要用於操作 (Primarily used for manipulation):** The passage indicates human hands have transitioned *toward* manipulation, but this isn't described as the primary function of chimpanzee hands.



"
天擇從哪個群體中刪除新的基因變異？,"The correct answer is **D: 顯性 (Dominant)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""天擇則會將其從顯性變異庫中移除"" which translates to ""Natural selection removes them from the **dominant** variation pool.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 隱性 (Recessive):** The passage doesn't say natural selection removes recessive variations.
* **B: 重組 (Recombination):** Recombination *creates* variation, it doesn't have variations removed *from* it.
* **C: 分離 (Segregation):** Segregation is a process that contributes to variation, it doesn't have variations removed *from* it.



"
哪個過程負責增加基因變異？,"The correct answer is **C: 突變 (Mutation)**.

The passage specifically states: ""**突變會增加新的基因變異 (Mutations will increase new genetic variation)**"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 分離 (Segregation):** Separation refers to the separation of alleles during gamete formation, it *reshuffles* existing variation, doesn't *create* new variation.
*   **B: 重組 (Recombination):** Recombination also *reshuffles* existing genetic variation, it doesn't create new genes.
*   **D: 顯性 (Dominant):** Dominance is a characteristic of alleles, not a process that creates variation.

Therefore, **突變 (mutation)** is the only process mentioned in the text that directly introduces new genetic variation."
根據文章中的資訊，靈長類動物應該攝取那些食物來解決「蛋白質問題」？,"The correct answer is **C: 蚱蜢**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""動物性食物 (螞蟻、白蟻、蛋) 不僅容易消化，並且提供含有所有必要胺基酸的優質蛋白."" (Animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein containing all the necessary amino acids.)
* **The passage also points out:**  靈長類動物難以從植物中獲取足夠的蛋白質，並指出植物需要烹飪才能消化。
* **蚱蜢 (grasshoppers)** are insects, therefore an animal food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 枯葉 (Dry leaves):** The passage identifies leaves as a source of protein *but* states they are difficult to digest without cooking.
* **B: 生豆 (Raw beans):** Similar to leaves, raw beans are identified as a plant-based protein source that is difficult for primates to digest.
* **D: 花莖 (Flower stems):** The passage doesn't mention flower stems as a relevant protein source.



"
根據文章，以下哪個問題不是因為缺乏必要胺基酸引起的？,"The correct answer is **A: 消化問題**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""amine acid intake deficiency leads to serious consequences: poor growth and malnutrition, eventually leading to death."" This directly links amino acid deficiency to growth problems, malnutrition, and death.
* **However, the passage also says:** ""leaves and legumes offer accessible protein...but are difficult for primates like us to digest *unless cooked*."" This indicates that the **difficulty with digesting** leaves and legumes is due to the *need for cooking*, not a direct result of a lack of amino acids.  The problem isn't the *amino acids* aren't there, it's that they can't be *accessed* due to digestibility issues.

Therefore, digestive problems are presented as a barrier to getting amino acids, not a consequence *of* a lack of them.
"
一個特定的次文化成員經常如何表明他們與該群體的關聯？,"The correct answer is **D: 使用有象徵形式的風格 (Using symbolic forms of style)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""次文化的成員通常透過特殊、有象徵意義的形式彰顯他們的屬於該群體，其中包括穿著打扮、行為舉止及暗語的使用。"" (Members of a subculture typically demonstrate their affiliation with the group through special, symbolic forms, including dress, behavior, and the use of slang).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 試著融入 (Trying to fit in)** - While subcultures offer belonging, the point isn't simply *fitting in* generally, but aligning with a *specific* group and often standing *out* from mainstream society.
* **B: 採納周圍每個人的信念 (Adopting the beliefs of everyone around them)** - Subcultures have their own distinct beliefs, not just adopting everything around them.
* **C: 接受社會規範 (Accepting social norms)** - Subcultures often *reject* or challenge mainstream social norms.



"
根據本文所提出的理論，某少數民族具有從事威脅行為的刻板印象，認同該民族的兒童會發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **B: 孩子將更有可能從事威脅行為 (Children will be more likely to engage in threatening behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that when children identify with a group and learn of negative stereotypes associated with that group (like poor academic performance), they often *conform* to those stereotypes. This is known as **stereotype threat**.  If a stereotype exists about a minority group engaging in ""threatening behavior,"" children identifying with that group may internalize this stereotype and, unfortunately, be more likely to act in ways that confirm it.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: 孩子會盡量避免參與威脅行為 (Children will try to avoid engaging in threatening behavior)** - This would be the opposite of what the passage suggests; the stereotype *leads* to more of the behavior.
*   **C: 孩子在社交場合會退縮 (Children will withdraw in social situations)** - While possible, the passage specifically focuses on performance/behavior directly linked to the stereotype, not just social withdrawal.
*   **D: 孩子會拒絕接觸其他少數種族 (Children will refuse to interact with other minority groups)** - This isn't addressed in the provided text.



"
根據文章，孩子對種族刻板印象的了解可能會影響以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: They their behavior.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""these racial stereotypes can influence their behavior."" It even provides an example of how a stereotype about academic performance can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy in children.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: They their chosen minority identity:** The passage doesn't discuss children *choosing* an identity, but rather how awareness of stereotypes relating to their existing identity can affect them.
* **C: Their relationship with other children:** While stereotypes *could* impact relationships, the passage doesn't directly address this.
* **D: Their definition of race:** The passage focuses on the *impact* of understanding existing stereotypes, not how children *define* race itself.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不太可能與野孩子的教養一致？,"The correct answer is **B: 強大的會話能力 (Strong conversational skills)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that wild children, raised without human interaction, exhibit fear or indifference towards humans.** This strongly implies a *lack* of developed social skills, including conversation. They learn behaviors from the animals raising them, not from human social interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible:

* **A: 獨立生活 (Independent living):**  Being abandoned or living in the wild necessitates independence.
* **C: 隱居傾向 (Tendency to seclusion):**  Fear and indifference towards humans would naturally lead to a desire to avoid social contact.
* **D: 社交焦慮 (Social anxiety):**  A lack of socialization and potentially traumatic experiences would likely result in anxiety in social situations.

Therefore, strong conversational ability is the least likely trait to be found in a wild child, given the information in the passage.



"
根據文章，以下哪項何者正確描述了兒童的野獸行為？,"The correct answer is **B: 野獸行為可能源於缺乏社會化**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that ""野孩子"" (wild children) exhibit behaviors mirroring the animals that raised them *because* they didn't receive the socialization process from adults.**  This directly links lack of socialization to ""wild"" behavior (fear of humans, indifference, mimicking animal behavior).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 大部分的野獸行為是由身體缺陷引起的** - The passage mentions physical defects as a *reason* some children are abandoned, but doesn't state it's the *cause* of wild behavior.
* **C: 野獸行為僅普遍存在於受父母監禁的兒童中** - The passage lists several reasons children become ""wild,"" including abandonment, being raised by animals, and living alone in the wild.  It's not limited to those imprisoned by parents.
* **D: 所有的野獸行為都是由嚴重的智力障礙引起的** -  The passage mentions intellectual disabilities as a reason for abandonment, but doesn't claim it's the sole cause of wild behavior.



"
根據文章，以下哪項做法不符合自給農業？,"The correct answer is **B: 生產食物出售給他人 (Producing food to sell to others)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""自給自足式農業是作物產量只足夠讓農人和其家人溫飽的農業型態 (Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture in which crops are grown primarily for the sustenance of the farmer and their family)."" This directly means the focus is on self-sufficiency, not selling produce.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **A: 以滿足農民家庭需求的產量為重點 (Focusing on yields sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer's family):** This is the *definition* of subsistence agriculture.
* **C: 注重高產量而非先進技術 (Focusing on high yields rather than advanced technology):** The passage mentions using simple techniques like crop rotation to *increase* yield, implying a focus on productivity without needing complex technology.
* **D: 採購當地農民的種子 (Purchasing seeds from local farmers):** The passage states subsistence farmers ""保留並使用當地生態區原生作物的種子 (retain and use seeds from crops native to the local ecosystem),"" which supports sourcing seeds locally.



"
下列何者正確描述了自給農業的作法？,"The correct answer is **D: 部分國家的農民仍在使用這種方法 (Some countries' farmers still use this method)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""歷史上，大部分的農民都從事自給自足農業，且許多開發中國家依舊如此。"" (Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and many developing countries still do.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 是一個完全有機的系統 (Is a completely organic system):** While self-sufficient agriculture *often* employs organic methods, the passage doesn't state it's *always* completely organic.
* **B: 使用獨特的技術來最大化收穫量 (Uses unique technologies to maximize yield):**  The passage describes the techniques as ""relatively simple"" (相對簡單的技術), not ""unique"" and focused on yield.
* **C: 允許農民在他們的地區分享自己的農作物 (Allows farmers to share their crops in their area):** The passage focuses on growing enough for the farmer and their family, not sharing with the wider community. It defines the purpose as self-sufficiency (""溫飽"").



"
參觀博物館屬於哪種旅遊類型？,"The correct answer is **C: 文化旅遊**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""如果造訪特定地點的目的是為了瞭解其歷史及文化，則此類型的旅遊稱為文化之旅。"" (If the purpose of visiting a specific place is to understand its history and culture, this type of tourism is called a cultural tour.) Visiting a museum is directly related to understanding history and culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 商務旅遊 (Business travel):** This involves travel for work purposes.
*   **B: 休閒旅遊 (Leisure travel):** While visiting a museum *can* be part of a leisure trip, the primary *purpose* isn't just relaxation and fun, but learning.
*   **D: 戶外旅遊 (Outdoor travel):** This focuses on outdoor activities in natural environments."
根據文章，下列何者可能是休閒遊客優先考慮的事？,"The correct answer is **B: 離開他們的日常生活休息一下**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""休閒旅遊...就是去一些跟日常生活環境截然不同的地方，放鬆玩樂。"" (Recreational tourism... is going to places very different from everyday life, to relax and have fun.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 沉浸於當地文化中 (Immerse themselves in the local culture):** This describes *cultural tourism*, not recreational tourism.
* **C: 造訪重要的地標 (Visit important landmarks):** While recreational tourists *might* visit landmarks, it's not the primary focus. This is more aligned with cultural tourism.
* **D: 了解一個地方的歷史 (Learn about a place's history):**  Again, this aligns with *cultural tourism*.



"
文中提到什麼可以幫助減輕當地教堂對變革的恐懼？,"The correct answer is **A: 記住創業行為的成功案例 (Remembering past entrepreneurial behaviors and successes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""回想起過去的創業行為及成功經驗，可幫助人們樂於接受當地教會的新改變與新方向。這種成功故事可以減弱對於改變的恐懼，同時讓人更願意接受未來的改變。""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 深入了解影響組織文化的人物 (Deeply understanding individuals who impacted the organization's culture):** While understanding these people is valuable, the passage doesn't directly link it to *reducing fear of change*.
* **C: 發現組織的驅動力 (Discovering the organization's drivers):**  This is a benefit of the process described, but not the specific element that reduces fear.
* **D: 了解組織的歷史 (Understanding the organization's history):** This provides context, but the passage specifically highlights *success stories* as the fear reducer.



"
根據文章，瞭解自己的歷史有什麼幫助？,"The best answer is **A: 減少對變革的恐懼 (Reduce fear of change)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""回想起過去的創業行為及成功經驗，可幫助人們樂於接受當地教會的新改變與新方向。這種成功故事可以減弱對於改變的恐懼，同時讓人更願意接受未來的改變。"" This directly links understanding history to reducing fear of change.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: 強化價值觀 (Strengthen values):** While understanding history *contributes* to understanding values, the passage says it helps *discover* values, not just strengthen existing ones.
* **C: 在組織中找到自己的位置 (Find one's position in the organization):** The passage states understanding history helps understand ""where they are positioned in the organization's history,"" but it's not the primary benefit highlighted.
* **D: 改善創業行為 (Improve entrepreneurial behavior):** The passage uses past entrepreneurial behavior as an *example* of what is remembered, not something that is *improved* by understanding history.



"
下列哪種說法正確描述了後現代學習方法？,"The correct answer is **D: 學習中沒有定則 (Learning has no set rules)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""後現代的學習方法讓人能擺脫定則 (Postmodern learning methods allow one to break free from rules)."" This is a direct answer.
* **The passage emphasizes:** Learning is about the *experience* between the learner and the knowledge, and questions the value of learning things we'll never use. This supports the idea of rejecting rigid rules about what *should* be learned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 某些學習經驗比其他學習經驗更有益 (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others)** - The passage implies the opposite; it critiques learning things that aren't practically applicable.
* **B: 學習應集中於我們相信我們將會經歷的事情 (Learning should focus on things we believe we will experience)** - While the passage points out the disconnect between learning and real-life application, it doesn't explicitly *prescribe* focusing only on what we'll experience.
* **C: 某些學習方式比其他學習方式更好 (Some learning methods are better than others)** - The passage focuses on *what* is learned, not *how* it is learned, and rejects the idea of a single ""better"" way to learn.



"
下列哪種說法並未正確反映後現代學習方法？,"The correct answer is **D: 可能永遠不會應用的知識仍然值得學習.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the opposite of option D.** The author argues that many things shown in instructional TV programs are things people will *never* actually do or use. The author implies that knowledge without practical application is less valuable.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reflected in the passage:

* **A: 有多種學習方式可以學習資訊 (There are multiple ways to learn information):** The passage begins by stating ""學習的良方不只一種 (The remedy for learning is not just one)."" This directly supports multiple learning methods.
* **B: 某些學習經驗應優先考慮於其他學習經驗 (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over others):** The critique of instructional TV implies that experiences relevant to one’s life and interests are more valuable than those that aren't.  The passage suggests we should focus on learning things we'll actually *use*.
* **C: 學習經驗依賴於學習者和提供的知識 (Learning experiences depend on the learner and the knowledge provided):** The passage states, ""學習發生在學習者與所呈現的知識間的經歷之中 (Learning happens in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented)."" This highlights the interaction between learner and knowledge.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the ideas presented in the passage."
在正常睡眠期間刻意喚醒後，下列哪些會干擾睡眠中斷的過程？,"The correct answer is **A: 閱讀一個半小時後再入睡**.

Here's why:

* **Sleep interruption** relies on waking briefly and *quickly* returning to sleep. The goal is to minimize the time awake.

Let's look at why each option is or isn't disruptive:

* **A: 閱讀一個半小時後再入睡** - Reading for 1.5 hours significantly extends the time awake, completely defeating the purpose of a quick sleep interruption. This would make it hard to fall back asleep within the 10-60 minute window.
* **B: 使用浴室後馬上回床上** - Using the bathroom is *suggested* in the passage as a method *for* sleep interruption (the liquid intake!). Returning to bed immediately afterwards doesn’t disrupt the process.
* **C: 關掉床頭的鬧鐘，二十分鐘後再入睡** - This *is* sleep interruption. The passage suggests moving the alarm to force you out of bed, and falling back asleep within 20 minutes fits the timeframe.
* **D: 醒來喝床頭櫃上瓶子裡的水** - While drinking water is a method for triggering sleep interruption, doing so after already waking up doesn't disrupt the *process* itself. It's part of the intended strategy.



"
下列哪個不是關於睡眠中斷的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **D: 喚醒後，目標是在兩個小時內重新入睡**.

Here's why:

The passage states that sleep interruption involves going back to sleep within **10-60 minutes** after waking up. Option D suggests a timeframe of *two hours*, which contradicts the provided information.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: 可以是基於生理週期的** - The text mentions using hydration (drinking a lot of liquids) as a physiologically-based method to interrupt sleep.
*   **B: 目標是不要完全喚醒自己** - The passage states you can achieve it ""by using a relatively quiet alarm to wake you consciously but not fully.""
*   **C: 過程發生在正常睡眠期間** - The definition of sleep interruption starts with ""intentionally waking up during a typical sleep period.""



"
當大腦嘗試更頻繁地做清醒夢時，什麼東西會增加？,"The correct answer is **D: 快速動眼期的間隔時間 (rapid eye movement intervals)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""清醒夢增加了快速動眼期狀態的間隔時間 (lucid dreaming increases the intervals of rapid eye movement state).""  It then explains that this is the core reason why frequent lucid dreaming can lead to fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 快速動眼期的次數 (number of rapid eye movement cycles)** - The passage doesn't say the *number* of REM cycles increases, but rather the *intervals* within them.
* **B: 能量水平 (energy levels)** - The passage states frequent lucid dreaming leads to *fatigue*, the opposite of increased energy.
* **C: 修復階段的長度 (length of the repair stage)** - The passage doesn't mention the length of the repair stage changing, only that reduced REM is a problem.



"
下列哪一項是頻繁做清醒夢可能對身體產生的負面影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 每晚的快速動眼期減少 (Every night, reduced REM sleep)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent lucid dreaming *increases* the intervals of REM sleep, but also implies that if the *number* of REM cycles decreases due to too much lucid dreaming, it causes problems.  It compares it to waking up every 20-30 minutes to watch TV - you don't get enough continuous sleep (and thus REM).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 快速動眼期的間隔時間減少 (Reduced intervals of REM sleep)** - The passage states the *opposite* – intervals *increase*.
* **C: 依賴清醒夢 (Dependence on lucid dreams)** -  The passage doesn't mention dependence, only fatigue from disrupting sleep.
* **D: 每晚的快速動眼期增加 (Increased REM sleep every night)** - While intervals increase, the overall *amount* of REM sleep is reduced if you're constantly interrupting it with lucid dreaming.



"
根據文章，傳統團隊和虛擬團隊有何相似之處？,"The correct answer is **A: 兩個團隊都被期望在同一水準上表現 (Both teams are expected to perform to the same quality standards)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""虛擬團隊必須遵守跟傳統團隊一樣的品質標準 (Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams)...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 兩個團隊在日常工作中都有不同程度的自主權 (Both teams have varying degrees of autonomy in their daily work)** - The passage states *virtual* team members typically have *more* autonomy, implying a difference, not similarity.
*   **C: 兩個團隊都向一個無形的管理團隊報告 (Both teams report to an invisible management team)** - The ""invisible management team"" is specifically described as a unique feature of *virtual* teams, not a commonality with traditional teams.
*   **D: 兩個團隊都在相同時區運作 (Both teams operate in the same time zone)** - The passage mentions virtual teams often work across different time zones, indicating they *don't* necessarily operate in the same time zone.



"
根據文章，關於實體團隊和虛擬團隊，以下哪個說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: 傳統團隊通常被要求的標準更高**.

Here's why:

The passage states that virtual teams must adhere to the *same* quality standards as traditional teams, but with *slight* differences. It doesn't suggest traditional teams have higher standards. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the text:

* **B: 虛擬團隊通常充當傳統團隊的聯絡窗口** - The text explicitly states virtual team members ""are often the point of contact with physical teams.""
* **C: 傳統團隊比虛擬團隊自主權較少** - The passage says virtual team members often have *more* autonomy.
* **D: 不同的時區可以使虛擬團隊受益** - The text implies this by stating that virtual teams often have to accommodate different time zones.



"
以下哪一項不是內容理論所關注的內容？,"The correct answer is **A: 成年後具體化的新慾望 (Newly formed desires after adulthood)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that content theories focus on needs and desires that are *internalized* during the process of becoming an adult. This means they are rooted in earlier development. While people certainly develop new desires as adults, content theories aren't primarily concerned with those *newly formed* wants. They're focused on the deeper, underlying motivations that have been shaped over time.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and align with the passage:

* **B: 一個人的環境如何影響他們的行為 (How a person's environment influences their behavior):** The passage mentions content theories explore what makes people *want to* or *not want to* do things in their environment.
* **C: 內化的需求 (Internalized needs):** This is a core concept of content theories, as the passage directly states people have needs/desires ""internalized"" as they mature.
* **D: 了解人們的喜好 (Understanding people’s preferences):** Finding what makes people ""heart-stirred"" or ""attracted"" is directly linked to understanding their preferences and underlying motivations.



"
以下哪項不是三分法法則的對象？,"The correct answer is **B: 在照片中創造生命和能量 (In photos to create life and energy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Rule of Thirds aims to create *vitality* *while* maintaining order.** It doesn't aim to *create* life and energy, but rather utilizes the arrangement to help exhibit it.
* **A, C, and D** all directly align with the passage's description of the Rule of Thirds:
    * **A** (Establishing baselines for subject placement) - The rule divides the image into thirds.
    * **C** (Keeping the subject in a specific and effective position) - The intersections are deemed the most effective spots.
    * **D** (Establishing order in a photo) - The passage explicitly states the rule helps maintain order.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that isn't a direct function or description of the Rule of Thirds."
以下哪一項並非描述 35 公釐的攝影格式？,"The correct answer is **C: 與許多常見格式具有不同的長寬比**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""許多常見格式（比方 APS 先進攝影系統格式）都等同或接近這個長寬比"" (many common formats are equal to or close to this aspect ratio). This directly contradicts the idea that it has a *different* aspect ratio than common formats.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

*   **A: 仍在生產中** - The passage states ""它至今日仍持續在生產"" (It is still produced today).
*   **B: 是數位相機所採用的格式** - The passage says ""數位相機的感光元件規格沿用了其長寬比"" (the specifications of digital camera sensors adopted its aspect ratio).
*   **D: 是世界上最常見的格式** - The passage begins by stating ""世界上最普遍的靜態圖像攝影格式是 35 釐米"" (the most common static image photography format is 35mm).



"
根據文章，隨著製造商提高鏡頭生產品質，變焦鏡頭得到了哪些改善？,"The correct answer is **C: It們的照片品質與固定焦距的鏡頭相似**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""隨著鏡片製造商的鏡片生產達到更高水準，這已不再成為問題。 這已能使變焦鏡頭拍出與定焦鏡頭不相上下的照片品質。"" This directly translates to zoom lenses achieving similar photo quality to prime (fixed focal length) lenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: It們有更高的鏡頭速度** - The passage states the *opposite* – zoom lenses typically have *lower* maximum apertures (slower lenses).
*   **B: It們在低光源條件下更易於使用** - Again, the passage states the opposite; low-light performance is a weakness of cheaper zoom lenses.
*   **D: It們比定焦鏡頭具有較少的焦點複雜度** - The passage states zoom lenses have *more* complexity.



"
根據文章中的資訊，何時使用變焦鏡頭可能會比定焦鏡頭更好呢？,"The correct answer is **C: 如果不想在較暗的環境中使用閃光燈**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""變焦鏡頭的另一缺點是鏡頭的最大光圈（速度）通常較低。 這就使得平價的變焦鏡頭在低光源、無閃光燈的環境中難以使用。""  This implies that *despite* the drawback of a lower aperture, a zoom lens *can* still be used in low light, just not as easily as a prime lens.  If you want to avoid flash, a zoom is still an option, even if it's not ideal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 如果最大光圈值是優先考慮因素** - The passage explicitly states zoom lenses have *lower* maximum apertures than prime lenses.
* **B: 如果想使用較少的鏡頭元件** - The passage states zoom lenses have *more* lens elements.
* **D: 如果正在尋找更多的焦點複雜度** - While zoom lenses *have* more complexity, this is presented as a drawback, not a benefit.



"
以下哪一項不是神秘主義的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **D: 強調尋求直接的個人體驗與許多其他形式的宗教信仰和崇拜差不多**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that **mysticism *is* distinguished** from other religious beliefs and worship *because* of its emphasis on direct, personal experience of a unique state of consciousness.  Option D claims it's *similar* to other forms of religion, which contradicts the provided definition.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: 強調體驗平和和幸福的意識狀態** - The passage mentions peace, insight, joy, and even ecstasy as characteristics of the altered states sought in mysticism.
*   **B: 神秘主義的追隨者尋求屬靈的真理之意識覺醒** -  This aligns directly with the passage's description of seeking spiritual truths and awakening.
*   **C: 神秘主義的追隨者可能採用有助於培養神性實相洞察力的做法** - The passage states followers seek practices that nurture these experiences.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是神秘主義的重點？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過共享的社群體驗追求洞察力**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that mysticism focuses on *individual* direct experience – ""個人對於一種獨特意識狀態的直接經驗"". It emphasizes a personal connection and inner experience with the divine.  Shared community experiences aren't mentioned as a defining aspect of mysticism in this text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: 追求神性實相的直覺** - The text states believers seek ""對神性實相 / 神或眾神的直接體驗、直觀或洞悉.""
*   **C: 強調喜悅的意識狀態** - The passage explicitly mentions ""平和、洞察、喜悅、甚至是狂喜"" as qualities of the unique state of consciousness.
*   **D: 追求對上帝的意識覺醒** - The definition includes ""意識覺醒"" as part of the pursuit.



"
根據文章，哪個族群可能開創了農業社會？,"The correct answer is **D: 來自大陸的毛利人 (Maori from the mainland)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the original belief was that Maori arrived in New Zealand and *established an agricultural society*. While the understanding of the Maori and Moriori relationship has evolved, the text still links the initial development of agriculture to the first Maori settlers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 來自紐西蘭的莫里奧里人 (Moriori from New Zealand):** The passage explains Moriori *migrated* to the Chatham Islands and developed a *peaceful* culture, not necessarily an agricultural one initially.
*   **B: 來自查特姆群島的莫里奧里人 (Moriori from the Chatham Islands):** These Moriori were the descendants of Maori who had already left the mainland, and the passage doesn't attribute agricultural origins to them.
*   **C: 玻里尼西亞的毛利人 (Maori from Polynesia):** While the Maori originated in Polynesia, the passage specifies they *established* agriculture *after* arriving in New Zealand.



"
根據文章，獵殺恐鳥的群體是哪個地方的第一批居民？,"The correct answer is **B: 紐西蘭**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""For a long period from the nineteenth to twentieth centuries, people believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Māori, who hunted the giant birds known as moa."" 

Therefore, the group that hunted moa (the giant birds) were the first inhabitants of *New Zealand*.
"
在哪種情況下，使用摺紙的淨土法會對折紙者有益？,"The correct answer is **D: 折紙者只在之前試過一兩次 (Folders have only tried it once or twice before)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Pureland origami was developed to *help beginners* and those with *less dexterity*.  Someone who has only tried origami a couple of times would likely fit into one of those categories.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 折紙者喜歡一次多褶 (Folders like multiple folds at once)** - Pureland origami specifically limits you to one fold at a time.
* **B: 折紙者有進階的動作技能 (Folders have advanced motor skills)** - The method is *for* people *without* advanced skills.
* **C: 折紙者正在創作需要反摺的摺紙作品 (Folders are creating origami that requires reverse folds)** - Pureland origami *doesn't allow* reverse folds or complex techniques.



"
以下哪個不是淨土摺紙的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **A: 它是專為有經驗的折紙者設計的 (It is designed for experienced origami artists)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Pureland origami was developed *to help beginners* and those with *less dexterity*. This directly contradicts the idea that it's for experienced folders. The other options (B, C, and D) are all explicitly mentioned as accurate descriptions in the text.
"
根據文章，哪個地點與印度河流域文明無關？,"The correct answer is **A: 哈拉帕**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that some scholars call the civilization the ""Harappan Civilization"" *because* Harappa was the first site excavated.** This means Harappa is *connected* to the civilization, not unrelated.
* **The passage specifically mentions that the civilization covered much of modern-day Pakistan (D).**
* **The passage mentions the Saraswati River (B) as a potential area of the civilization.**
* **The passage explicitly states the civilization included parts of northeastern Afghanistan (C).**

Therefore, Harappa is the only option that doesn't represent a location the passage links to the Indus Valley Civilization.  It's a name associated *with* the civilization, not a place it *didn't* reach."
文中沒有提到以下何者為青銅時代文明可能的名稱？,"The correct answer is **D: 印度河谷文明**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * **印度河流域文明 (Indus Valley Civilization)** as the main name.
    * **印度河-薩拉斯瓦蒂文明 (Indus-Saraswati Civilization)** as a proposed alternative.
    * **哈拉帕文明 (Harappan Civilization)** as a name based on the first discovered site.

* **印度河谷文明 (Indus River Valley Civilization)** is a *slightly* different phrasing than the names explicitly mentioned in the text. While closely related to 印度河流域文明, it isn't specifically listed as a possible name.

Therefore, the question asks for the option *not* mentioned, and 印度河谷文明 fits that criteria.
"
根據文章，以下何者產生了長期效益？,"The correct answer is **A: 與他人合作 (Cooperation)**.

The passage explicitly states that the *long-term* best choice is for people to cooperate with each other. While selfish behavior might offer *short-term* gains, it's cooperation that leads to long-term benefits for the majority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 優先考慮自身利益 (Prioritizing self-interest)** - The passage states this yields *short-term* benefits, not long-term.
* **C: 強調有利於少數人而非多數人的事物 (Emphasizing what benefits a few rather than many)** - The passage implies this is *detrimental* to long-term well-being.
* **D: 認知到貪婪可以是有益的 (Recognizing that greed can be beneficial)** - The passage identifies greed as a negative force to overcome, not something to embrace.



"
根據文章，如果某人著重於眼前的效益，他們可能會優先考慮以下哪項？,"The correct answer is **D: 自私 (Selfishness)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""自私的行為在短期總能得到更多利益"" (selfish behavior always yields more benefits in the short term).  Someone focused on immediate gains would therefore prioritize selfish actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 無私 (Altruism):** This is the *opposite* of prioritizing immediate benefits.
* **B: 協作 (Collaboration):** Collaboration is mentioned as a long-term goal, not something that provides immediate gratification.
* **C: 合作 (Cooperation):** Similar to collaboration, cooperation is a long-term strategy.



"
根據文章，誰支付了很大一部分戰爭費用？,"The correct answer is **D: 菲律賓人民**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""美國帝國主義征戰菲律賓的戰爭支出則由菲律賓人民自身繳納。他們被迫繳稅給美國殖民政權..."" This directly states the Filipino people were forced to pay for the war expenses through taxes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 菲律賓政府:** While the taxes were *collected* through the colonial government, the passage states the *people* were the ones forced to pay.
*   **B: 華爾街銀行:** The banks handled the debt, but didn't pay the initial expenses.
*   **C: 美國殖民政權:** The colonial regime *received* the taxes, but the people were the ones paying."
哪個時期出現在聖殿騎士團時期之前？,"The correct answer is **C: 中世紀初期**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""中世紀中期前承中世紀前期..."" which translates to ""The High Middle Ages came *after* the Early Middle Ages...""  Therefore, the Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages (the period during which the Knights Templar were founded).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 中世紀晚期 (Late Middle Ages)** - This came *after* the High Middle Ages.
*   **B: 12 世紀 (12th Century)** - The 12th century is *within* the High Middle Ages, not before it.
*   **D: 13 世紀 (13th Century)** - The 13th century is also *within* the High Middle Ages."
哪個時期出現在聖殿騎士團時期之後？,"The correct answer is **A: 中世紀晚期**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (聖殿騎士團的時代) is *followed by* the Late Middle Ages (中世紀晚期).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 12 世紀** - The 12th century is *within* the High Middle Ages, not after it.
*   **C: 中世紀盛期** - This *is* the period the Knights Templar existed in, not what came after.
*   **D: 11 世紀** - The 11th century is *before* the High Middle Ages.



"
在羅馬帝國，醫生和外科醫生沒有提到以下哪種醫療或手術？,"The correct answer is **A: 使用各種鎮靜劑治療創傷後壓力症候群 (Using various sedatives to treat post-traumatic stress syndrome)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on *physical* medical interventions.** It details sedatives for pain management, amputations for gangrene, and techniques to control blood flow during surgery.
* **Post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) is a *psychological* condition.** While the Romans used sedatives, the passage doesn't suggest they understood or specifically treated the psychological trauma associated with wounds or warfare.  The concept of PTSD as we understand it today is a modern one.
* **Options B, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned in the text:**
    * **B:**  ""doctors already knew of many sedatives...including opium alkaloids from poppy seeds and hyoscyamine from henbane seeds."" (Hyoscyamine is a component of henbane, and related to scopolamine.)
    * **C:**  ""They were proficient at amputation...saving patients from gangrene and the damage caused by tourniquets and arterial clamps stopping blood flow.""
    * **D:**  ""They were proficient at amputation...saving patients from gangrene.""

Therefore, the passage does *not* mention the treatment of PTSD."
根據文章，以下哪個選項不是羅馬帝國醫療領域進步的原因？,"The correct answer is **C: 建立學習型醫院 (Establishing teaching hospitals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**
    * **A: 醫療團的成立 (Establishment of medical corps):** ""奧古斯都皇帝開始招募醫生，這些醫生甚至成立了第一支用於戰後時期的羅馬醫療隊 (Augustus began recruiting doctors, who even formed the first Roman medical corps for use after battles).""
    * **B: 帝國積極的軍事政策 (Empire's aggressive military policies):**  The entire premise of the passage is that the military nature of the Roman Empire *contributed* to medical advancement.  The need to treat soldiers drove innovation.
    * **D: 皇帝招募醫生 (Emperor's recruitment of doctors):**  As stated above, Augustus directly recruited doctors.

* **The passage *does not* mention:** Anything about the establishment of formal learning hospitals.  While doctors were recruited and medical knowledge was growing, there's no indication that structured teaching hospitals existed.

Therefore, the only option *not* supported by the text is C.



"
視力的能力取決於什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 視覺系統的感覺器官 (the sensory organs of the visual system)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""視力，或視物的能力，來自視覺系統的感覺器官或眼睛。"" (Vision, or the ability to see, comes from the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 生物體的需求 (the needs of organisms):** While the passage mentions needs influence the *complexity* of eye structures, it doesn't state that vision *depends* on the needs themselves.
* **C: 對某些波長的敏感度 (sensitivity to certain wavelengths):**  Sensitivity to wavelengths is a *characteristic* of the visual system, but not what vision fundamentally *depends* on.
* **D: 不同程度的視力 (different degrees of vision):** This describes *variations* in vision, not what vision is based on.



"
生物體之間的眼睛結構變化取決於什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 生物體的要求 (The organism's needs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""各構造的複雜度依其對有機體需求不同而有差別"" (The complexity of each structure differs depending on the organism's needs).  This directly links the variation in eye structures to what the organism *needs* to see.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 波長的敏感度 (Wavelength sensitivity):** While wavelength sensitivity *is* a characteristic of eye structure, the passage doesn't say it's the *reason* for variation between organisms.
* **C: 敏銳度的程度 (Degree of acuity):** Similar to wavelength sensitivity, acuity is a *result* of structure, not the driving force behind its variation.
* **D: 生物體的複雜性 (Complexity of the organism):**  The passage focuses on the needs of the organism, not just its overall complexity. A simple organism might need a highly specialized eye for its specific environment.



"
根據文章，關於錫克教的陳述，何者沒有正確描述該宗教？,"The correct answer is **B: 上師是錫克教特有的基本面向**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""上師是所有印度信仰的基礎..."" (The Guru is the foundation of all Indian faiths...) This directly contradicts the idea that the Guru is *unique* to Sikhism. While central to Sikhism, the concept of a Guru exists in other Indian religions.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 錫克教是印度教傳統中宗派分裂的結果** (Sikhism is the result of a sectarian split from Hindu tradition) - The passage explicitly says this: ""...錫克教是源自印度次大陸的宗教。其起源為 15 世紀旁遮普地區自印度教傳統中分裂出來的派別。""
* **C: 在該宗教創始人古魯那奈克之後，有九位大師跟隨** (There were nine gurus who followed the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak) -  The passage states: ""此宗教是由古魯那奈克（1469–1539）於 15 世紀所創立。在他之後又依序出現了九位大師。""
* **D: 錫克教的某些傳統源自於印度教** (Some traditions of Sikhism originate from Hinduism) - The passage says: ""雖然他們承認來自印度教的根源與傳統，但錫克教徒認為自身的信仰不同於印度教。""



"
根據文章，以下哪一項被認為是錫克教信仰體系的核心面向？,"The correct answer is **A: 上師的概念 (The concept of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""在錫克教裡，上師構成了整個信仰的重要核心。"" (In Sikhism, the Guru constitutes the essential core of the entire faith.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 印度教傳統 (Hindu traditions):** While Sikhism *originated* from a break within Hindu traditions, the text emphasizes Sikhs see their faith as *distinct* from Hinduism.
* **C: 拒絕承認其他印度宗教 (Rejecting other Indian religions):** The text doesn't state rejection, just distinction.  It acknowledges roots in Indian beliefs.
* **D: 講旁遮普語 (Speaking Punjabi):**  While Gurmat is *in* Punjabi, the language itself isn't the core of the belief system.



"
根據文章，注意力缺失症的孩子可能難以專注於哪些事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 學校作業**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""患有注意力缺失症的兒童，很難專注於學校作業之類的事物..."" (Children with ADHD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork...).

The passage also clarifies they *can* focus on things they enjoy, like playing games and watching cartoons, eliminating options B, C, and D.
"
根據文章，為什麼注意力缺失症的孩子傾向於從事危險行為？,"The correct answer is **D: 刺激他們的大腦**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""這些孩子容易惹上很多麻煩，因為他們不能用尋常的方法刺激大腦，要「做出危險的行為、牽扯進打架並挑戰權威」才能刺激大腦。"" (These children easily get into trouble because they cannot stimulate their brains in normal ways, and must ""engage in dangerous behaviors, get involved in fights and challenge authority"" to stimulate their brains.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 減少過動 (Reduce hyperactivity)** - The passage describes hyperactivity *as* a symptom, not something they try to reduce through risky behavior.
*   **B: 幫助他們與同儕建立聯繫 (Help them connect with peers)** - The passage actually states ADHD *hinders* their relationships with peers.
*   **C: 為了得到父母的關注 (To get their parents' attention)** - While attention-seeking *can* be a factor in some cases, the passage specifically links risky behavior to the need for brain stimulation.



"
根據文章中的資訊，以下哪一項不是鷹架式學習的例子？,"The correct answer is **C: 獨立自學課程 (Independent self-study course)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly defines scaffolding as *support* provided to someone learning something new.** It highlights examples like teachers and software help features.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

* **A: 電腦遊戲開始時的教學 (Tutorials at the beginning of a computer game):** This provides step-by-step guidance, helping a player learn the game's mechanics – a clear form of support.
* **B: SAT 輔導老師 (SAT tutor):** A tutor offers instruction, guidance, and feedback to help a student improve their SAT score.
* **D: 小聯盟教練 (Minor league coach):** A coach provides training and direction to help players develop their skills.

* **C: 獨立自學課程 (Independent self-study course):** This lacks the direct *support* component of scaffolding.  While helpful, it's the student relying solely on their own resources, not receiving assistance *during* the learning process.  The passage states scaffolding is about support *while* experiencing a new learning experience.



"
關於鷹架式學習的概念，以下哪一項描述不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: It is also known as project-based learning.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""鷹架式教學並非學習方法，而是一種輔助..."" (Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support...).  It also specifically contrasts it with project-based learning (""以專案為基礎的學習方式"") - saying scaffolding *builds upon* project-based learning, but isn't the same thing.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 鷹架可以是虛擬的 (Scaffolding can be virtual)** -  The passage states: ""虛擬鷹架已內建在軟體中"" (Virtual scaffolding is built into software...).
* **B: 它更像是輔助而非學習方法 (It's more of a support than a learning method)** - This is a direct statement from the passage.
* **D: 鷹架用於在學習經驗開始時提供支援 (Scaffolding is used to provide support at the beginning of a learning experience)** - The passage explains scaffolding ""可為正在經歷新學習體驗的人提供支援"" (provides support for people undergoing new learning experiences).



"
根據文章，以下哪個 MySpace 功能可以幫助閱讀有困難的學生？,"The correct answer is **A: 自訂功能 (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""您可自訂頁面，使之易於閱讀：亦可根據喜好，使用大量或少量顏色。"" (You can customize the page to make it easier to read: you can also use a lot or a little color according to your preferences.) This directly relates to helping students who have difficulty reading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 部落格 (Blogs):** While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn't mention them helping with reading difficulties.
*   **C: 一個網址 (A single web address):** The passage mentions the easy URL is helpful for students with keyboard or spelling difficulties, *not* reading.
*   **D: 5400 萬個人檔案 (54 million profiles):** This is a statistic about MySpace's size and doesn't relate to accessibility for students with reading difficulties.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是赫魯雪夫對工人暴動的回應？,"The correct answer is **C: 增加減薪幅度 (Increase the amount of pay cuts)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The protests were *about* food shortages and pay cuts. It also says Khrushchev made concessions on *economic demands* and agreed to appoint Gomulka.
* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **A: 任命新總理 (Appointing a new prime minister):** ""...agree to appoint Władysław Gomułka as the new prime minister.""
    * **B: 使用坦克恢復秩序 (Using tanks to restore order):** ""...Khrushchev ultimately sent tanks to restore order.""
    * **D: 承認一些經濟要求 (Acknowledging some economic demands):** ""...he did make concessions on some economic demands...""
* **Increasing pay cuts would be the opposite of a response to the protest.** The protests were *against* pay cuts.

Therefore, option C is the only action Khrushchev would *not* have taken in response to the worker's revolt.



"
以下哪一項不是波蘭騷亂的原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 任命瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆爾卡 (Appointment of Władysław Gomułka)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the appointment of Gomułka was a *result* of the unrest, not a cause of it.** The workers protested, and *as a concession*, Khrushchev agreed to appoint Gomułka.

Let's look at why the other options *are* causes:

* **A: 共產主義 (Communism):** The passage states the unrest turned into a ""general protest against communism.""
* **B: 食物短缺 (Food shortages):** The passage explicitly mentions food shortages as a reason for the initial protests.
* **C: 減薪 (Wage cuts):** The passage also explicitly states wage cuts were a reason for the initial protests.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項未影響蘇聯和美國之間的關係？,"The correct answer is **B: 對德國的看法 (Views on Germany)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""德國是二戰時期的共同敵人，促使蘇聯與美國合作."" This means a *shared* view of Germany initially *united* them, it didn't cause a rift.

The passage *does* state that differences in:

* **A: 文化差異 (Cultural differences)**
* **C: 截然不同的做法 (Different practices)**
* **D: 制度糾紛 (Systematic disputes)**

...created tensions and contributed to the Cold War.

Therefore, a shared enemy (Germany) wasn't a divisive factor, making **B** the correct answer.
"
關於發送神經脈衝的目的，以下哪一項描述不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: 減緩血液流動 (Slow down blood flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the nervous system *keeps blood flowing* and *maintains homeostasis*. It doesn't say anything about slowing blood flow down. In fact, it implies the opposite – the nervous system ensures blood flow is maintained.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

*   **B: 管理血液流動 (Manage blood flow):** The passage says the nervous system *keeps blood flowing*, indicating a management role.
*   **C: 維持體內恆定 (Maintain homeostasis):**  The passage explicitly states the nervous system *maintains homeostasis*.
*   **D: 避免身體潛在威脅 (Avoid potential threats to the body):** The passage says nerve impulses *help the body avoid potential threats*.

Therefore, slowing down blood flow is the only option that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
在吉薩高原上可以找到什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 寺廟**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""位於埃及亡者谷的吉薩高原或「吉薩金字塔群」，包含好幾座金字塔、幾座小陵墓、**幾座神廟**和巨大的獅身人面像。"" (The Giza Plateau... contains several pyramids, several smaller tombs, **several temples**, and the Great Sphinx).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 墓穴 (Tombs):** The passage mentions ""smaller tombs,"" but temples are also explicitly listed.
* **C: 所有七大奇蹟 (All seven wonders):** The passage states the Great Pyramid is the *only* remaining wonder, not all of them.
* **D: 大金字塔 (Great Pyramid):** While the Great Pyramid *is* at Giza, the passage lists other structures as well, making ""temples"" a more comprehensive answer to what you can find *at* Giza.



"
大金字塔的建造目的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 榮耀一位法老** (To honor a pharaoh).

The passage explicitly states: ""大金字塔是為了榮耀古夫法老所建造的"" (The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 成為七大奇蹟之一 (To be one of the Seven Wonders)** - While true, this is a *result* of its grandeur, not the *purpose* of its construction.
*   **C: 成為地標 (To be a landmark)** - Again, it *became* a landmark, but that wasn't the initial reason for building it.
*   **D: 存放逝者的墳墓 (To store the tombs of the deceased)** - While it *contained* a tomb, the primary purpose was to honor the pharaoh, not simply to be a burial place. The other structures within the complex housed the tombs of family members.



"
我們會認識燒毀神殿的縱火犯一事是誰該負責？,"The correct answer is **C: 史特拉波 (Strabo)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Ephesians *wanted* Herostratus's name forgotten.
* However, we know his name *because* the Greek historian Strabo mentioned it.  Without Strabo, we wouldn't know who burned the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 以弗所人 (The Ephesians):** They tried to *erase* his name, not make us aware of it.
* **B: 亞歷山大大帝 (Alexander the Great):** He offered to rebuild, he wasn't responsible for making the arsonist known.
* **D: 阿緹密絲 (Artemis):** She was the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not the one who revealed the arsonist.



"
關於重建阿緹密絲神廟的說法，何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 神殿在亞歷山大大帝統治後重建**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""亞歷山大死後，神廟才於公元前 323 年被重建起來。"" (The temple was rebuilt only after Alexander's death in 323 BC.) This clearly indicates the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander's reign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 重建費用由亞歷山大大帝支付 (The reconstruction costs were paid by Alexander the Great):** The passage says Alexander *offered* to pay, but his offer was *rejected*.
* **C: 黑若斯達特斯被命令支付重建費用 (Herostratus was ordered to pay the reconstruction costs):** The passage doesn't mention anything about Herostratus paying for the rebuild. He was condemned to have his name erased from history.
* **D: 神殿於公元前 320 年重建 (The temple was rebuilt in 320 BC):** The passage states it was rebuilt in 323 BC, not 320 BC.



"
根據文章，用兩條腿走路的物種最早出現於何時？,"The correct answer is **A: 七百萬年前**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""查德人猿可能早在七百萬年前就已用雙足行走."" This means the earliest evidence of bipedalism (walking on two legs) mentioned in the text is from the Chad anthropoid around seven million years ago.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 二百萬年前:** This is when *Homo Erectus* started walking upright, but not the earliest instance of bipedalism.
*   **C: 三百九十萬年前 & D: 四百二十萬年前:** These dates relate to *Australopithecus* and are later than the potential date for the Chad anthropoid.



"
這些物種中，哪一個習慣用兩隻腳行走？,"The correct answer is **B: 直立人 (Homo Erectus)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""隨著 Homo Erectus（亦即直立人）的出現，人類在兩百萬年前開始直立行走."" (""With the emergence of Homo Erectus, humans began to walk upright two million years ago."")
*   While the passage mentions *Australopithecus* (南方古猿) showed characteristics of bipedalism, it states they weren't *habitual* walkers like *Homo Erectus*.
*   *Chad Sahar人 (查德人猿)* is mentioned as possibly walking on two feet *even earlier*, but the text doesn't state they were habitual walkers.
*   ""Two-footed animal specialization"" (兩足動物特化) is a description of a trait, not a specific species.



"
德國海軍在二戰期間試圖達成什麼目的？,"The correct answer is **B: 阻止英國接收人員和貨物** (Prevent Britain from receiving personnel and goods).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""德國海軍則試圖阻斷運輸（主要使用 U 型潛艇）"" This directly translates to the German Navy attempting to *block* the transport of goods (and people) to Britain.
* **Option A is incorrect:** While intercepting supplies is *how* they tried to achieve their goal, the goal itself was broader than just intercepting.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The German Navy was trying to *stop* transatlantic shipping, not *conduct* it.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage focuses on Germany trying to stop aid *to Britain*, not preventing the US from receiving anything.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，誰在北大西洋戰役期間的海戰取得了最大的成功？,"The correct answer is **B: 德國**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the German navy attempted to *disrupt* the Allied shipping (using U-boats). While the passage doesn't explicitly state who ""won"", the focus on Germany's efforts to *block* the transfer of goods implies they were having some success in the battle, making them the most successful party in the naval war described. The passage states that if the Allies had lost, Germany would have been able to conquer Britain, further suggesting Germany's success in the war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 英國跟美國:** The passage says the US and Britain were *trying* to send supplies, but it's Germany actively trying to *stop* them.
*   **C: 德國跟英國:** The passage focuses on Germany's disruptive actions, it doesn't indicate that Britain was being successful in the battle.
*   **D: 英國:** The passage doesn't state Britain was more successful than Germany in the battle.

"
亞述人使用騎兵時，哪一樣東西不存在？,"The correct answer is **A: 馬鞍 (Saddle)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""當時尚未發明馬鞍，因此亞述騎兵是騎在毫無裝備的馬背上作戰。"" (At that time, saddles had not yet been invented, so Assyrian cavalry fought on bare horsebacks.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 十字弓 (Crossbow)** - The passage mentions the deadly crossbow being used.
*   **C: 戰車 (Chariot)** - The passage discusses improvements to chariots made by the Assyrians.
*   **D: 盔甲 (Armor)** - The passage states crossbows could penetrate enemy armor, implying armor *did* exist.



"
利用騎兵進行的戰鬥是如何進行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 騎馬 (riding horses)**.

The passage explicitly states that cavalry ""is an army that fights on horseback."" This directly answers the question of how battles using cavalry were conducted.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 步行 (walking)** – Cavalry *doesn't* fight on foot.
*   **B: 沒有盔甲 (no armor)** – While the passage mentions arrows penetrating armor, it doesn’t say the cavalry themselves didn't wear armor.
*   **D: 使用的士兵較少 (using fewer soldiers)** – The passage doesn't mention anything about the number of soldiers used in cavalry battles.



"
根據文章，在哪裡不會找到一個普通的巴比倫市民？,"正確答案是 **D: 在內部聖殿獻祭**。

文章明確指出「內部聖殿只有祭司才能進入」。因此，一位普通的巴比倫市民不可能進入內部聖殿獻祭。

其他選項皆有可能：

*   **A: 帶祭品到神廟中庭內**：人們會準備祭品獻給神，而中庭是公開的區域。
*   **B: 在主要寺廟參加儀式**：文章提到祭司透過儀式與節慶努力滿足神的需求，這表示人們可以參加儀式。
*   **C: 在神廟中庭內的節慶**：文章提到節慶在神廟中庭舉行，因此一般市民可以參與。"
以下哪些是專為祭司而設的？,"The correct answer is **B: 內部聖殿 (Internal Sanctuary)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""每座神廟都有一個開闊的神廟中庭，接著是一間**只有祭司才能進入的內部聖殿**。"" (Every temple had an open temple courtyard, followed by an **internal sanctuary that only priests could enter**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 節慶 (Festivals)** - The text says festivals were used to *satisfy the gods*, not reserved for priests.
*   **C: 儀式 (Rituals)** - Rituals were used to satisfy the gods, performed *by* priests, but not exclusive to them.
*   **D: 塔廟 (Ziggurat)** - Ziggurats were towers *within* temple complexes with a special sanctuary on top for the god, not just for priests.



"
圖坦卡門王在何時受到關注？,"The correct answer is **C: 在發現他的墳墓後 (After his tomb was discovered)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""然而，他的墳墓在 1922 年被發現了，這使他成為名人。"" (However, his tomb was discovered in 1922, which made him famous.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在其墓被盜後 (After his tomb was robbed)** - The passage actually states the tomb was *not* robbed, which is part of what made the discovery so special.
*   **B: 在他在位期間 (During his reign)** - The passage says he wasn't important during his time and wasn't listed with other kings.
*   **D: 在古代國王名單上提到後 (After being mentioned on the lists of ancient kings)** - The passage states he *wasn't* on those lists."
是什麼讓圖坦卡門王成為著名的埃及王？,"The correct answer is **A: 發現他未受打擾的墳墓 (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""However, his tomb was discovered in 1922, which made him famous."" and ""Past many tombs had been robbed, but this tomb remained completely undisturbed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 他在古代國王名單上的地位 (His position on lists of ancient kings)** - The passage says he *wasn't* on most lists of ancient kings.
* **C: 他的墳墓中被盜走了成千上萬的文物 (Thousands of artifacts were stolen from his tomb)** - The passage states the tomb was *not* robbed.
* **D: 他在古埃及時期的重要地位 (His importance during ancient Egypt)** - The passage says he wasn't considered important in ancient times.



"
希臘詩人荷馬無法做什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 看 (See)**.

The passage states Homer was a ""legendary blind poet"". Blindness means he could not see. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 聽 (Hear):** Being blind doesn't affect one's ability to hear.
*   **C: 走 (Walk):** The passage doesn't mention anything about Homer's ability to walk.
*   **D: 說話 (Speak):** He was a *poet*, meaning he spoke or recited his work."
哪個著名的希臘人以文學以外的東西而聞名？,"The correct answer is **C: 畢達哥拉斯 (Pythagoras)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Pythagoras was a mathematician known for the Pythagorean theorem (a concept in geometry, not literature).
*   Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes are all mentioned as playwrights (literature).

Therefore, Pythagoras is the only option known for something *outside* of literature."
猶太家族大部分時間都在哪裡度過？,"The correct answer is **A: 在戶外 (Outdoors)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""猶太家族生活中大多時刻都是在室外度過 (Jewish family life was mostly spent outdoors).""

While cooking happens in the courtyard (C) and shops face the street (B), the overarching statement is they spend *most* of their time outdoors.  D is incorrect as the passage implies houses aren't as important due to the climate.
"
對猶太家族來說，什麼東西不是很重要？,"The correct answer is **C: 他們的家 (their homes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states ""在溫暖氣候中，房子就沒那麼重要了 (in the warm climate, houses weren't so important).""  It then goes on to describe how life revolved around outdoor activities, and homes were simple structures built of stone because wood was expensive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他們的氣候 (their climate)** - The climate is *why* houses weren't as important, not something unimportant itself.
* **B: 他們的商店 (their shops)** - Shops are mentioned, but not described as unimportant.
* **D: 他們的烹飪 (their cooking)** - Cooking is specifically mentioned as an outdoor activity, showing it *was* a part of their lives.



"
以下哪個不是斯堪地納維亞國家之間的區別？,"The correct answer is **B: 土地**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states differences between the Scandinavian countries in **history**, **customs**, and **people**. It highlights the distinct histories and cultures of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, as well as the people who inhabit them.

However, it doesn't mention differences in *land* as a distinguishing factor between these countries. While their landscapes vary, the passage doesn't focus on that as a difference *between* the nations themselves. It speaks more to the land *of* Greenland and its prior inhabitants.

Therefore, **土地 (land)** is the one option that isn't presented as a distinction between the Scandinavian countries in the given text.



"
誰是第一批定居在格陵蘭島的人？,"The correct answer is **A: 愛斯基摩部落 (Eskimo tribes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already inhabited it at that time."" This means the Eskimo tribes were there *before* Erik the Red.
"
哪一群人更喜歡不坐在椅子上用餐？,"The correct answer is **C: 富有的羅馬男性**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""富有的男人則喜歡一同參加宴席，並在席間側臥享用他們的大餐"" (wealthy men preferred to attend banquets and recline while enjoying their meals). This directly indicates they didn't typically sit in chairs while eating.
"
以下哪個不會是古羅馬宴會的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 烤火雞盤**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans *didn't* have turkey (""古羅馬人也沒吃過火雞""). The other options are all mentioned as part of Roman dining habits:

*   **A: 貧窮的客人坐在椅子上用餐** - The passage says poor people ate while sitting on chairs.
*   **B: 蝸牛開胃菜** - The passage lists snails as a food they ate (""蝸牛"").
*   **C: 富有的男性在晚餐期間躺下來** - The passage mentions wealthy men reclining while dining (""富有的男人則喜歡一同參加宴席，並在席間側臥享用他們的大餐"").

"
根據文章，以下哪一項不太可能產生持久的影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 一個小文化**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""規模較小的文化往往不留歷史痕跡便消失殆盡，無法被認定為正統文明."" This directly indicates that small cultures are *less likely* to have a lasting impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一個社會:** The passage *defines* civilization as being shared by a society.
*   **C: 一個城邦:**  The passage mentions city-states (城邦) as predecessors to nations and as a factor in defining the scale of a civilization.
*   **D: 一個文明文化:** The passage states that a civilization involves a continuation of knowledge and cultural footprint through generations - inherently implying lasting impact.



"
根據文章，國家的前身是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 一個城邦**.

The passage explicitly states: ""城邦是國家的前身"". (City-states were the precursors to nations.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 一個文明文化 (A civilization culture)** - While related, the passage says city-states *preceded* nations, not that they *are* a civilization culture.
* **B: 一個單一文化 (A single culture)** - The passage doesn't directly state this.
* **D: 一個小文化 (A small culture)** - The passage actually says small cultures are likely to disappear *without* becoming civilizations.



"
關於杜克耶古堡的說法，哪個敘述不正確？,"正確答案是 **A: 它是為慶祝西藏蒙古軍隊勝利而建造的**。

原文明確指出，杜克耶古堡是為了紀念活佛夏仲阿旺朗傑**對抗**西藏蒙古軍隊的勝利而建造的，而不是慶祝他們的勝利。

其他選項都與原文資訊相符：

*   **B: 它位於不丹** - 原文提到它位於帕羅區。
*   **C: 火災摧毀了許多堡壘遺跡** - 原文提到火災導致大部分文物遺失。
*   **D: 它是由夏仲阿旺朗傑建造的** - 原文明確說明了這一點。"
下列哪個陳述正確描述了杜克耶古堡火災的結果？,"The correct answer is **C: It is still one of Bhutan’s most stunning attractions.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Despite the fire, the fortress survived and is protected, and remains one of Bhutan’s most stunning attractions."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 唯一倖存的遺跡是夏仲阿旺朗傑的畫像 (The only surviving relic is a portrait of Shacha Wangchen)** - The passage says a portrait of *Shaba* Wangchen survived, not Shacha Wangchen. Also, it implies more than just one thing survived (""a portion of the relics"").
* **B: 西藏蒙古軍隊勝利了 (The Tibetan Mongolian army won)** - The passage states the fort was *built to commemorate a victory* against the army, meaning they *didn't* win.
* **D: 它由夏仲阿旺朗傑保存 (It was preserved by Shacha Wangchen)** - Shacha Wangchen *built* the fortress, he didn't preserve it after the fire. The passage says it was *protected* after the fire, but doesn't specify *by whom*.



"
以下關於柬埔寨的陳述，哪個是正確的？,"The correct answer is **D: 泰國人摧毀了金邊 (Thai people destroyed Phnom Penh)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""泰國人在 18 世紀多次侵略柬埔寨，並在 1772 年摧毀金邊 (Thai people invaded Cambodia multiple times in the 18th century, and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 越南人摧毀了金邊 (Vietnamese people destroyed Phnom Penh)** - The passage states the Vietnamese *invaded* Cambodia, not that they destroyed Phnom Penh.
*   **B: 柬埔寨在 1772 年入侵了泰國 (Cambodia invaded Thailand in 1772)** - The passage states the opposite: Thailand invaded Cambodia.
*   **C: 柬埔寨在 18 世紀初遭到越南入侵 (Cambodia was invaded by Vietnam in the early 18th century)** - The passage states the Vietnamese invasion occurred in the *last few years* of the 18th century, not the early part.



"
以下哪項陳述正確描述了柬埔寨的入侵？,"The correct answer is **D: 泰國人多次入侵柬埔寨**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""泰國人在 18 世紀多次侵略柬埔寨..."" (Thai people invaded Cambodia multiple times in the 18th century...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 越南人多次入侵柬埔寨 (Vietnamese people invaded Cambodia multiple times):** The passage states Vietnam *also* invaded in the *last few years* of the 18th century, but doesn't say ""multiple times.""
* **B: 1772 年泰國人和越南人入侵柬埔寨 (Thai and Vietnamese people invaded Cambodia in 1772):** The passage states Thai people destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772, but doesn't mention a Vietnamese invasion *in* 1772. Vietnamese invasions came later in the century.
* **C: 越南人摧毀了金邊 (Vietnamese people destroyed Phnom Penh):** The passage states Thai people destroyed Phnom Penh.



"
荷蘭東印度公司在台灣期間沒有做過下列哪件事？,"The correct answer is **D: 願意割讓台灣的控制權給清朝 (willing to cede control of Taiwan to the Qing Dynasty)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Dutch *were replaced* by the Qing Dynasty through force in 1683.** It doesn't say the Dutch willingly gave up control. They lost control *to* the Qing Dynasty, not *offered* it.
* **A, B, and C are all directly mentioned in the text:**
    * **A:** ""荷蘭東印度公司在臺灣西南部建立一處基地"" (The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan)
    * **B:** ""開啟了原住民穀物生產方式的轉型"" (initiated a transformation of indigenous grain production methods)
    * **C:** ""雇用中國勞工在該公司的水稻及甘蔗田裡工作"" (employed Chinese laborers in the company’s rice and sugarcane fields)

《馬關條約》訂立了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 日本對台灣的管轄權 (Japan's control over Taiwan)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that the Treaty of Maguan (《馬關條約》) was signed *after* China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War and resulted in the *cession of Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan*. This means the treaty established Japan's right to govern Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 日本在第一次甲午戰爭中戰勝 (Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War)** - While true, the treaty *resulted* from the war, it didn't *establish* the war's outcome. The question asks what the treaty *did*.
*   **B: 台灣作為清朝省份的地位 (Taiwan's status as a Qing province)** - The treaty *ended* Taiwan's status as a Qing province.
*   **C: 台灣能夠重新控制其沿海地區 (Taiwan was able to regain control of its coastal regions)** - The treaty did the opposite; it transferred control *away* from China.



"
如何測量化學物質的酸鹼度？,"The correct answer is **C: 化學物質中氫離子數量 (Chemical substance's number of hydrogen ions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions in a chemical substance (the H in pH stands for hydrogen).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 化學物質的酸鹼度 (Chemical substance's acidity/alkalinity):** This is *what* you're measuring, not *how* you measure it.  The question asks about the measurement itself.
* **B: 化學物質中的質子數量 (Chemical substance's number of protons):** While hydrogen ions *are* protons, the passage links pH specifically to the *hydrogen ion* content, not just protons generally.
* **D: 化學物質中的電子數量 (Chemical substance's number of electrons):** The passage mentions electrons in relation to how hydrogen ions are formed (losing an electron), but pH is defined by hydrogen ion concentration, not total electron count.



"
什麼東西從氫離子中被去除了？,"The correct answer is **D: 電子 (electrons)**.

The passage states: ""氫離子是失去電子後的質子 (因為氫原子由一個質子和一個電子組成)."" This directly tells us that an electron is removed from a hydrogen atom to create a hydrogen ion.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 質子 (protons)** - Hydrogen ions *are* protons, but something must be removed *to make* the proton/hydrogen ion.
*   **B: 酸鹼值 (pH)** - pH is a *measure* of hydrogen ion concentration, not something removed from it.
*   **C: 鹼性 (alkalinity)** - Alkalinity is a property of a substance, not something removed from a hydrogen ion."
以下哪項陳述並未正確描述一群獅子？,"The correct answer is **C: 雄性和雌性都是近親**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""雌獅通常彼此為近親，是同一大家族中的姐妹和女兒。"" (Female lions are usually related to each other, being sisters and daughters from the same family.) It *doesn't* say the males are related to the females.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: 牠們的行為類似於狗群** (Their behavior is similar to dog packs) - The passage explicitly states this: ""獅群的行為和狼群或狗群非常相像"" (Lion behavior is very similar to wolf or dog packs).
*   **B: 雌雄比例不均** (The male-to-female ratio is uneven) - The passage says a pride consists of ""一到三隻成年公獅，再加上多達三十隻母獅和幼獅"" (one to three adult male lions, plus up to thirty female lions and cubs), indicating a significant imbalance.
*   **D: 它們既致命又具有社交性** (They are both deadly and social) - The passage states they are ""對牠們的獵物非常狠"" (very fierce towards their prey – deadly) and describes a complex social structure (social).



"
以下哪項陳述並未正確描述獅子的行為？,"The correct answer is **D: 牠們的行為類似於其他大型貓科動物**.

Here's why:

The passage *specifically* states that lions are **unlike** other large cats in their social behavior. It highlights the similarity between lions, wolves and dogs, and explicitly points out this distinction from other big cats.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: 牠們很會社交** - The passage describes lions living in prides, showing they are highly social.
*   **B: 牠們的行為與狼差不多** - The passage states lion behavior is ""very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs.""
*   **C: 雄性和雌性對獵物出手都很致命** - The passage says they are ""very ferocious towards their prey,"" implying deadliness for both sexes.



"
兔子是哪種掠食者的常見獵物？,"The correct answer is **C: 中型貓**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""位於牠們之下的是種類較多的中型貓科動物，主要以兔子、羚羊和鹿等中型獵物為食。"" (Below them is a larger number of medium-sized cats, which mainly feed on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelope, and deer.)

Therefore, rabbits are a common prey for medium-sized cats.
"
體型較小的貓科動物通常狩獵以下哪一種動物？,"The correct answer is **A: 齧齒類動物**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""最後許多小型貓（偶有家貓）也會捕食為數眾多的小型獵物，包括昆蟲、齧齒類動物、蜥蜴和鳥類。""  This directly links small cats to hunting rodents (齧齒類動物).

The other options (rabbits, antelope, deer) are mentioned as prey for *medium-sized* cats, not small cats.
"
以下哪項不是美洲豹貓狩獵方式的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 只狩獵體型較小的動物**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""美洲豹貓的獵物幾乎都比牠們的體型小很多"" (The jaguarundi's prey is almost always much smaller than its own size).  This *describes* what they hunt, it doesn't *how* they hunt.  It's a result of their hunting, not a method of it.

* **The passage *does* describe these as hunting methods:**
    * **A: 隱蔽身形融入周圍環境** (Camouflaging to blend with the surroundings) - ""虎貓狩獵的方式是與周圍環境融為一體，然後再撲向獵物.""
    * **B: 追踪獵物的氣味** (Tracking prey by scent) - ""科學家認為美洲豹貓憑靠嗅覺跟蹤和尋找獵物""
    * **C: 夜間追踪獵物** (Hunting at night) - ""牠們在夜晚擁有良好的夜視能力""



"
以下哪項並未正確描述美洲豹貓？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 牠們的嗅覺很弱 (Their sense of smell is weak)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scientists believe ocelots *rely on their sense of smell* to track and find prey. This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions of ocelots based on the text:

*   **A: 牠們能夠在夜間打獵 (They are able to hunt at night)** - The text says they have good night vision.
*   **B: 牠們悄悄地移動 (They move quietly)** - The text states they can move ""silently.""
*   **D: 牠們更喜歡捕獵小動物 (They prefer to hunt small animals)** - The text says their prey is ""almost always much smaller than themselves."""
以下哪一項不是老虎最厲害的強項？,"The correct answer is **A: 咆哮 (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that tigers can roar, but it also notes that their roar isn't as specialized or strong as a lion's. It describes the tiger's roar as a ""confused, shouted speech"" rather than a powerful roar.

The passage *does* explicitly state tigers are strong at:

* **攀爬 (Climbing)** - ""能攀爬（雖然不太專精）"" (can climb, although not specialized)
* **跳躍 (Leaping)** - ""遠距離跳躍"" (long-distance leaping)
* **拉扯 (Pulling/Strength)** - ""擁有超過一個強壯人類五倍的拉力"" (has a pulling strength more than five times that of a strong human)

Therefore, roaring is the least highlighted skill and the one the passage suggests is not a primary strength of the tiger.
"
根據文章，老虎和獅子的區別是什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 吼叫的聲音 (Roaring sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""老虎的吼嘯不像獅子全然是嗓音的吼嘯，而比較像是一句混亂、喊叫的話語."" (The tiger's roar is not like the lion's, which is a roar purely of the voice, but rather like a confused, shouted utterance.)  This directly contrasts the roars of tigers and lions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 游泳能力 (Swimming ability)** - The passage says tigers *can* swim, but doesn't compare their swimming to lions.
*   **C: 跳躍距離 (Jump distance)** - The passage states tigers can jump long distances but doesn't mention how this compares to lions.
*   **D: 拉力 (Pulling strength)** - The passage says tigers have five times the strength of a strong human, but doesn't compare this to lions.



"
根據文章，羅伯·虎克在其他生物學家之前做了什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 觀察死亡細胞**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""He was the first to observe dead cells."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 使用顯微鏡觀察生物體 (Using a microscope to observe living things)** - While Hooke *used* a microscope, the text says he observed *cork* which consists of *dead* cells. It doesn't say he was the first to observe living things.
* **C: 觀察小正方形 (Observing small squares)** - He observed shapes that *looked like* small squares, but the key is he was the first to observe them *in cells* which were dead.
* **D: 發現生物的最小功能單位 (Discovering the smallest functional unit of living things)** - The passage states cells *are* the smallest unit, but doesn't say Hooke *discovered* this. It was a later understanding.



"
「細胞」一詞的由來是什麼意思？,"The correct answer is **B: 小房間**.

The text states: ""細胞一詞來自拉丁文的 cella，意指小空間。"" (The word 'cell' comes from the Latin cella, meaning small room.) And it adds that Hooke thought the compartments he saw in cork looked like rooms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 小正方形 (Small square)** - While the text mentions cells *look* like small squares, that's not the *meaning* of the word.
* **C: 小結構 (Small structure)** - Too general.  'Small room' is the specific origin of the term.
* **D: 小球 (Small sphere)** - The text mentions cells can look like small spheres, but this isn't the origin of the name.



"
根據文章，大多數動物有哪種能力？,"The correct answer is **B: 移動 (Moving)**.

The passage states: ""多數動物都能移動 (Most animals are able to move).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 飛行 (Flying)** - The passage mentions animals *can* fly, but doesn't say *most* can.
*   **C: 游泳 (Swimming)** - The passage mentions animals *can* swim, but doesn't say *most* can.
*   **D: 挖掘 (Digging)** - The passage mentions animals *can* dig, but doesn't say *most* can.



"
根據文章，有些動物沒有什麼能力？,"The correct answer is **C: 大腦**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""只有動物有大腦（然而甚至不是所有動物都有；例如水母就沒有大腦）。"" This means some animals *lack* a brain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 細胞** - The passage states animals *are made of* cells, not that they lack them.
*   **B: 消化能力** - The passage says animals ""eat and digest food,"" meaning they all have digestive abilities.
*   **D: 進食能力** - The passage states animals ""eat,"" meaning they all have the ability to eat.



"
什麼東西可以幫助植物進行光合作用？,"The correct answer is **D: 陽光 (sunlight)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""植物透過光合作用從陽光中獲取養分。"" (Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 遮蔽 (shelter):** While plants *provide* shelter, they don't need shelter to perform photosynthesis.
*   **B: 動物 (animals):** Animals benefit from plants, but aren't needed *by* plants for photosynthesis.
*   **C: 食物 (food):** Plants *are* food, but they create their own food through photosynthesis, and don't require food from external sources."
植物會吸入人類呼出的什麼氣體？,"The correct answer is **D: 二氧化碳**.

The passage explicitly states: ""植物吸收人類呼出的二氧化碳"" (Plants absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 食物 (Food)** - While plants *provide* food, they don't absorb it from humans.
* **B: 氧氣 (Oxygen)** - Plants *produce* oxygen, they don't absorb it from humans.
* **C: 水 (Water)** - Plants need water, but the passage doesn't mention absorbing it from human breath.



"
根據文章，下列哪個例子會阻礙進化的過程？,"The correct answer is **A: 小群體無法在新環境中生存 (Small groups cannot survive in the new environment)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes speciation as a *result* of a small group adapting to a new environment.** It specifically states that the new population *needs* to change to be competitive. If the small group *cannot* survive, there's no population to adapt, and therefore no possibility of speciation. The process stops before it can begin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 部分族群移居新環境 (Part of the population migrates to a new environment)** - This is the *starting point* of speciation as described in the passage.
* **C: 族群在新環境中調整其適應能力 (The population adjusts its adaptations in the new environment)** - This is the *core* of speciation. Adaptation is what drives the differences between the groups.
* **D: 一個族群最終形成兩個族群 (One population eventually forms two populations)** - This is a *result* of speciation, not something that would stop it.



"
下列哪一個敘述並未正確描述物種形成的過程？ ,"正確答案是 **A: 發生於新族群無法適應環境時**。

**原因：**

段落中明確指出，新族群需要**適應**新環境，並透過改變特質來提升競爭力。如果新族群無法適應環境，他們會滅絕，而不會形成新的物種。種化是關於成功適應新環境並因此分化，而不是無法適應。

其他選項都正確描述了段落中提到的種化過程：

*   **B: 這是進化過程的一個重要部分** - 段落中提到種化是演化過程中「很重要的一環」。
*   **C: 它指的是新物種的形成** - 段落中明確定義種化為「新物種產生」。
*   **D: 無法避免它的發生** - 段落中提到種化是演化過程中「無法避免的後果」。

"
循環系統的哪一部分會將血液引向心臟？,"The correct answer is **D: 靜脈 (Veins)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""血液從稱為動脈的血管中流出心臟，然後經由稱為靜脈的血管流回心臟."" (Blood flows *out* of the heart through arteries, and then returns to the heart through veins.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 動脈 (Arteries):** Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **B: 微血管 (Capillaries):** Capillaries are the smallest vessels and connect arteries and veins; they don't primarily direct blood *to* the heart.
* **C: 器官 (Organs):** Organs are parts *of* the circulatory system that receive blood, they don't direct it.



"
循環系統中，哪些是最細小的血管？,"The correct answer is **A: 微血管 (Capillaries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""最細小的血管稱為微血管"" (The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 動脈 (Arteries):** Arteries carry blood *away* from the heart, they aren't the smallest vessels.
*   **C: 靜脈 (Veins):** Veins carry blood *back* to the heart, they aren't the smallest vessels.
*   **D: 器官 (Organs):** Organs are parts of the body with specific functions, not blood vessels.



"
昆蟲折疊翅膀的能力會增加以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **B: 躲藏空間 (Hiding space)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""這使牠們有更多可鑽入的小地方來躲避捕食者 (This allows them to fit into more small spaces to avoid predators).""  This directly connects the ability to fold wings with increased hiding space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 食物供應 (Food supply)** - The passage mentions finding food *because* of flight, not because of folding wings.
*   **C: 尋找伴侶 (Finding a mate)** - Similar to food, flight aids in finding mates, not wing folding.
*   **D: 飛行速度 (Flight speed)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about wing folding affecting flight speed.



"
文中沒有提到以下何者為受昆蟲飛行能力影響的事物？,"The correct answer is **B: 壽命 (Longevity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states insects' flight ability helps them:**
    * **Find food (採食):** ""...more effectively find food...""
    * **Find mates (繁殖):** ""...more effectively find mates...""
    * **Avoid predators (效率 - implied through easier escape):** ""...more easily evade predators...""

* **The passage does *not* mention anything about how flight affects an insect's lifespan (壽命).**

Therefore, longevity is the only option not influenced by flight according to the text.
"
以下哪一個特徵通常與恐龍無關？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽毛**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that people *don't* associate birds (which are now considered dinosaurs) with dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly. While it's now known that many dinosaurs *did* have feathers, it's a characteristic that historically led people to distinguish them from what they thought dinosaurs were.

The passage also explicitly mentions that dinosaurs and birds share these characteristics:

*   **A: 後腿行走** (walking on two legs) - ""像暴龍一樣用兩隻後腳行走""
*   **C: 下蛋** (laying eggs) - ""會下蛋""
*   **D: 有爪的腳** (clawed feet) - ""腳上有鱗片和爪子""



"
下列哪一項通常不被認為是鳥類和恐龍共同特徵？,"The correct answer is **C: 飛行能力**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people *don't* consider birds to be dinosaurs because of their ability to fly. While some dinosaurs had feathers, and some may have even glided, sustained flight like birds is not a characteristic shared by most (or any) of the non-avian dinosaurs.

The passage *specifically* mentions the following as shared characteristics:

*   **A: 下蛋 (Laying eggs)**
*   **B: 用兩條後腿行走 (Walking on two legs)**
*   **D: 有爪的腳 (Having clawed feet)**

Therefore, flight is the feature that distinguishes birds from the traditional image of dinosaurs."
根據文章，三角龍可能吃蘇鐵屬植物的哪一部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 樹幹**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""三角龍會在食用樹幹之前，用牠強而有力的喙扯下樹葉。"" This directly indicates that the triceratops *ate* the trunk (樹幹) of cycads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 尖銳的葉子 (Sharp leaves):** The passage says the triceratops *removed* the leaves before eating the trunk, but doesn't say they ate the leaves themselves.
*   **C: 根部 (Roots):** The passage mentions the triceratops could handle roots with its teeth, but does not state it ate them.
*   **D: 果實 (Fruit):** The passage does not mention anything about cycads having fruit or the triceratops eating them. It only mentions that other animals like parrots can eat toxic fruits.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項最有可能成為三角龍的食物？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 有堅硬樹枝的植物 (Plants with hard branches)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""三角龍的牙齒不僅能咬碎樹葉，甚至連堅硬的樹枝和樹根也能搞定."" (Triceratops' teeth could not only crush leaves, but also tackle hard branches and roots.) This directly indicates they could eat plants with hard branches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 一隻樹懶 (A sloth):** The passage *mentions* sloths as being able to eat toxic plants, but doesn't suggest Triceratops would eat a sloth.
* **C: 一隻鸚鵡 (A parrot):**  The passage mentions parrots as descendants of dinosaurs that can eat toxic plants, but like sloths, there's no indication Triceratops would eat one.
* **D: 具有毒果實的植物 (Plants with toxic fruits):** The passage presents a debate about whether Triceratops could eat plants *like* cycads (which may be toxic), but doesn't confirm they *did* eat toxic plants. It even states some scientists believe they *couldn't* eat them.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項運動在義大利北部地區很可能廣受歡迎？,"The correct answer is **C: 滑板滑雪 (Skiing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""冬季運動項目在北部地區最受歡迎，這裡的義大利人也會參與相關的國際和奧林匹克賽事。"" Skiing is a classic winter sport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 足球 (Football/Soccer):** While popular in Italy overall, the passage doesn't specify it's *particularly* popular in the north.
*   **B: 排球 (Volleyball):** Listed as a popular sport, but no mention of regional preference.
*   **D: F1 賽車 (F1 Racing):** Listed as a popular sport, but no mention of regional preference.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，以下哪種運動為義大利贏得世界冠軍？,"The correct answer is **A: 足球**.

The text specifically states: ""義大利國家足球隊和德國國家足球隊均是世界第二成功的球隊，他們也是 2006 年國際足球總會世界盃的冠軍。"" (Italy and Germany are the two most successful football teams in the world, and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.) This directly indicates that Italy won a World Championship in football (soccer).
"
在什麼事件後，盧森堡的某些地區成為了比利時的一部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 比利時革命 (Belgian Revolution)**.

The passage states: ""盧森堡的某些地區在過去曾是盧森堡的一部分，但在 1830 年代的比利時革命之後變成比利時。"" (Some parts of present-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.)
"
以下哪種因素影響了盧森堡的中立地位？,"The correct answer is **A: 德國佔領 (German occupation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Luxembourg *tried* to maintain neutrality, but was occupied by Germany in both World Wars. This occupation directly impacted and compromised its neutrality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 加入歐盟 (Joining the EU):** While important for Luxembourg's development, joining the EU didn't *impact* its neutrality - it came *after* periods of neutrality being challenged.
* **C: 比利時革命 (Belgian Revolution):** This led to Luxembourg losing territory to Belgium, but didn't directly affect its attempt at neutrality.
* **D: 成為獨立國家 (Becoming an independent nation):** Independence is a prerequisite for *having* a neutral stance, but doesn't explain what *affected* that stance.



"
土耳其的總面積有多少平方公里在歐洲？,"The correct answer is **D: 23764 平方公里**.

The passage explicitly states: ""23,764 平方公里（9,174 平方英里）在歐洲.""
"
根據文章，土耳其大約有多少英里長？,"The correct answer is **A: 1600 英里**.

The passage states: ""土耳其的領土長 1,600 多公里（1,000 英里）..."" This directly answers the question."
梵蒂岡城將拉丁語用於什麼用途上？,"The correct answer is **A: 宗教儀式**.

The passage states: ""拉丁語則多半在宗教儀式中使用。"" (Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 日常溝通 (Daily communication):** The passage states Italian is used for daily communication.
* **C: 法律 (Laws):** The passage states Italian is used for laws and official documents.
* **D: 官方溝通 (Official communication):** The passage states Italian is used for official documents.
"
在梵蒂岡城，義大利語不用於哪個用途？,"The correct answer is **C: 宗教儀式**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""拉丁語則多半在宗教儀式中使用"" (Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies).  It explicitly says Italian is *not* used for religious ceremonies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 法律 (Laws):** The text says Vatican laws are *written* in Italian.
*   **B: 官方溝通 (Official communication):** The text says Vatican official documents are in Italian.
*   **D: 日常溝通 (Daily communication):** The text says most of the workforce uses Italian in their daily lives.



"
根據文章，以下何者為在精密的電腦上進行混音的好處？,"The correct answer is **A: 音樂**.

The passage specifically states: ""音樂錄製的方式，通常是以精密的電腦處理並進行混音。"" (Music recording is usually processed and mixed with sophisticated computers).

The other options are mentioned in the passage but not as things *benefiting* from computer processing and mixing:

*   **B: 動畫 (Animation)** is created *using* computers, but the passage doesn't say mixing improves animation.
*   **C: 圖片 (Pictures)** and **D: 建築 (Architecture)** aren't mentioned in the context of computer processing or mixing."
根據文章，以下哪個地點的大多數住宅都有沖水廁所？,"The correct answer is **A: 摩亨佐-達羅城**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""哈拉帕城和摩亨佐-達羅城的每座房屋裡幾乎都有抽水馬桶，並與一個精密的污水處理系統相連。"" (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system).

The other options are mentioned as having toilets, but not that *most houses* had them:

*   **波斯 (Persia):** The passage just says toilets *existed* in ancient Persia.
*   **聖托里尼 (Santorini):** The passage mentions drainage systems were *found under houses*, not necessarily that every house had a toilet.
*   **中國 (China):**  Similar to Persia, toilets *existed* in ancient China.

"
在以下哪些地點發現了先進的污水處理系統？,"The correct answer is **A, B, C, and D**. Here's why:

*   **哈拉帕 (Harappa):** The passage explicitly states Harappa had a ""sophisticated sewage system.""
*   **聖托里尼 (Santorini):** The passage mentions ""drainage systems"" were found in Santorini (part of the Minoan civilization).
*   **埃及 (Egypt):** The passage states toilets existed in ""ancient Egypt."" While it doesn't specifically say ""advanced sewage system,"" the presence of toilets suggests some level of waste management.
*   **中國 (China):** The passage states toilets existed in ""ancient China."" Similar to Egypt, this implies some waste management infrastructure.

Therefore, all four options are supported by the provided text."
以下哪個原因會讓滑冰者轉彎？,"The correct answer is **A: 溜冰鞋冰刀底部的輕微弧度 (The slight curvature of the skate blade's bottom)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""由於冰刀底部略有弧度，當冰刀往某側傾斜時，其接觸冰面的邊緣亦呈彎曲。 這會使溜冰者轉向。"" (Because the bottom of the skate blade is slightly curved, when the skate leans to one side, the edge in contact with the ice also becomes curved. This causes the skater to turn.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 溜冰鞋冰刀刀鋒上的雙刃 (The double blade on the skate blade)** - The passage says double blades help *grab* the ice more effectively, but doesn't explain *how* turning happens.
* **C: 滑冰者整體的技術水平 (The skater's overall skill level)** - Skill is important for skating, but the passage focuses on the *mechanism* of turning provided by the skate itself.
* **D: 冰的品質 (The quality of the ice)** - Ice quality affects skating, but it's not the primary reason for turning as described in the passage.



"
根據文章，下列何者正確描述了現代溜冰鞋刀片上的凹陷？,"The correct answer is **C: 凹陷**.

The passage specifically states: ""雙重刀刃即使在傾斜時，也能更有效地抓住冰面。 由於冰刀底部略有弧度，當冰刀往某側傾斜時，其接觸冰面的邊緣亦呈彎曲。 這會使溜冰者轉向... **刀刃間有一處凹陷**.""

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they don't *describe* the concave section itself.

*   **A: 雙重刀刃** describes the overall blade structure, not the indentation.
*   **B: 弧度** describes the curvature of the blade, contributing to turning but not being the indentation.
*   **D: 傾斜** is an action performed *with* the skate, not a feature of the blade itself.



"
根據文章，哪個過程可以讓原子消除光的過剩能量？,"The correct answer is **D: 刺激輻射的排放 (Stimulated emission)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that atoms eliminate excess energy by a process called **""stimulated emission""**, where they emit particles called photons. 
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: 輻射 (Radiation):** While light *is* a form of radiation, the passage specifies *stimulated emission* as the process.
    * **B: 刺激光子的排放 (Stimulated photons emission):** While this is *part* of the process, it doesn't fully describe it. The passage calls it stimulated *emission*, not just photon emission.
    * **C: 光子 (Photons):** Photons are *what* is emitted, not the process *how* the energy is eliminated.

The passage directly connects the removal of excess energy to the process of ""stimulated emission."" Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer."
是什麼導致原子發出光子？,"The correct answer is **A: 釋放過剩的能量 (Releasing excess energy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""若要恢復到之前的能階，它們必須排放從光線中獲得的額外能量。他們透過發出稱為「光子」的微粒子來完成。""  This directly links the emission of photons to getting rid of *extra* energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 明亮光線的刺激 (Stimulation by bright light):** While bright light *triggers* the emission (stimulates it), the light doesn't *cause* the photon to exist. The photon is the result of releasing stored energy.
* **C: 能量水平不穩定 (Unstable energy levels):** The passage describes atoms *returning* to previous levels, implying instability is temporary and the emission is the correction.
* **D: 輻射不良反應 (Poor radiation response):** The passage explains radiation is *part* of the process, not a negative reaction.



"
根據文章，什麼原因最終會讓燈泡壞掉？,"The correct answer is **C: 燈泡裡面的燈絲燒壞了 (The filament inside the bulb burns out)**.

The passage states: ""在通電數百小時之後，燈泡中的鎢絲最終會燒壞，燈泡也不再發亮。"" (After hundreds of hours of being powered on, the tungsten filament in the bulb will eventually burn out, and the bulb will no longer light up.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 燈具未正確關閉 (The fixture is not turned off correctly)** - The passage mentions turning the fixture off for *safety* when replacing the bulb, not as a cause of the bulb failing.
* **B: 燈泡的金屬底部只有部分插進插座 (The metal bottom of the bulb is only partially inserted into the socket)** - This describes a dangerous situation *while replacing* a bulb, not why it fails.
* **D: 流入插座的電流變慢 (The current flowing into the socket slows down)** - The passage doesn't mention the current slowing down; it talks about the danger of current if you touch the socket while live.



"
更換燈泡時，以下哪個可能有觸電危險？,"The correct answer is **C: 燈泡的底座 (The base of the bulb)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that danger of electric shock exists if you touch the socket or *metal base* of the bulb while it's still partially inserted. The passage explains that current can flow through the metal parts and into you.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 燈絲 (Filament):** The filament is inside the glass bulb and doesn't pose a shock hazard when changing the bulb.
*   **B: 電燈開關 (Light switch):** While the switch controls the power, the passage emphasizes the danger even *after* turning off the switch if the bulb is still partially in the socket.
*   **D: 電線 (Wire):** While wires carry electricity, the passage focuses on the direct contact hazard with the socket and bulb base.



"
根據文章，當原子核分裂時會發生什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 釋放能量 (releases energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""再次分裂原子核會接著釋出一部份的該能量"" (splitting the atomic nucleus again releases some of that energy).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 獲得質子 (gains protons)** - The passage doesn't mention protons being *gained* during fission.
*   **C: 原子變得不穩定 (atom becomes unstable)** - The passage states some atoms *are already* unstable and *then* split, not that splitting *causes* instability.
*   **D: 失去中子 (loses neutrons)** - While neutrons *are* involved in the fission process, the passage doesn't state that neutrons are necessarily *lost* as a direct result of the split itself, but rather that the nucleus is made of them.



"
以下哪個會將長途電話反射回地球,"The correct answer is **B: 衛星**.

The passage explicitly states: ""太空中的人造衛星接收到訊號，並在瞬間將訊號反射回地球。"" (Space satellites receive the signal and instantly reflect it back to Earth.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 望遠鏡 (Telescopes)** - The passage says telescopes are used *by* scientists in space to *see* clearly, not to reflect phone signals.
*   **C: 燈光 (Lights)** - Lights don't play a role in reflecting long-distance phone calls.
*   **D: 火箭 (Rockets)** - Rockets *launch* satellites into space, they don't reflect signals."
其中哪些用於將望遠鏡送入太空？,"The correct answer is **B: 火箭 (Rockets)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""人造衛星是用火箭送上太空的 (Satellites are sent into space using rockets)."" Since telescopes are also sent into space (as stated in the passage), rockets are the means of transportation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 光束 (Beams):** Beams are related to signal transmission, not launching objects into space.
* **C: 地球大氣層 (Earth's atmosphere):** The atmosphere *hinders* telescopes, it doesn't help launch them.
* **D: 高於 100 英尺的衛星 (Satellites taller than 100 feet):** The passage mentions the height of the *rockets*, not the satellites, and the satellites are what are being launched.



"
要追蹤時間的流逝，應該注意哪些方面的週期性事件？,"The correct answer is **B: 重複 (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...可透過觀察重複的週期性事件來標記自己的時間流逝。週期性事件指的是定期不斷重複發生的事。"" This directly links tracking time to observing things that *repeat* regularly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 持續時間 (Duration):** While duration is *measured* by time, it's not what we *observe* to track time's passage.
*   **C: 影響 (Influence):** The passage mentions time *influences* things, but doesn't say we track time *by* its influence.
*   **D: 困難 (Difficulty):** The passage acknowledges time is hard to understand, but this isn't how we track it.



"
根據文章，時間用於比較事件的哪個方面？,"The correct answer is **A: 長度**.

The passage states: ""時間也是我們比對事件持續期間（長度）的方式。"" This directly answers the question.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 重複** - While the passage mentions repetitive events *help us mark* time, time isn't *used to compare* repetition itself.
*   **C: 經驗** - The passage talks about how we *perceive* time, but not how we compare experiences using it.
*   **D: 影響** - The passage states time *influences* everything, but doesn't say we compare events based on its influence.



"
根據文章，以下哪個被視為皇位繼承人典型會做的事？,"The correct answer is **B: 放棄大學以從軍 (Abandon university to join the military)**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Traditionally, heirs to the throne would go straight into the military after completing their education."" This means it was *typical* for them to *not* continue with university, but instead go directly to the military. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 獲得二等二級學位 (Achieve a 2:2 degree)** - While Charles *did* get this degree, the passage highlights this as being *untraditional*, not typical.
*   **C: 學習歷史 (Study history)** - Charles studied several subjects, but this isn't presented as a tradition.
*   **D: 先上大學再從軍 (Go to university first then join the military)** - This is what Charles *did*, but the passage emphasizes that this was a departure from tradition.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，查爾斯首先做了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 就讀三一學院 (Attended Trinity College)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""查爾斯卻去劍橋的三一學院，修習人類學和考古學..."" (Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge, studying anthropology and archaeology...). This is the first action mentioned regarding Charles's education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 畢業前從軍 (Joined the military before graduating)** - The passage specifically contrasts Charles *not* joining the military immediately, stating it was the traditional path.
* **B: 研究考古學 (Studied archaeology)** - While he *did* study archaeology, it was *after* going to Trinity College.
* **C: 獲得學位 (Obtained a degree)** - He obtained a degree later in his studies; going to Trinity College was his first step.
"
奧拉夫特里格維松的艦隊來自哪個國家？,"The correct answer is **D: 挪威**.

The passage explicitly states that Olaf Tryggvason was a ""ambitious Norwegian"" and led the fleet *from* Norway, aiming to reclaim his kingdom there.
"
在歷史上的哪個時期，德國對愛沙尼亞產生了強烈的文化影響力？,"The passage states the German influence was around the ""15th century."" 

* 15th century was roughly 600 years ago (2024 - 1400 = 624).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 大約 600 年前**.
"
愛沙尼亞語受什麼影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 德國字母表 (German alphabet)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Estonian writing ""originated from the German alphabet"". While the other options are *related* to the story, they aren't the direct source of influence on the language itself.

*   **A: 字符 Õ/õ (Character Õ/õ)** - This is a *result* of the influence, not the source.
*   **C: 德國僧侶 (German monks)** - They *used* the German alphabet, but weren't the alphabet itself.
*   **D: 上帝 (God)** - This is the *reason* for the monks' actions, not a direct influence on the language.



"
根據文章，以印地語為母語的人數波動取決於哪個因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 是否算入與印地語非常相似的方言**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""持母語者的數量，會根據是否算入近似方言的使用者數量而改變。"" This directly translates to ""The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not users of closely related dialects are included.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 是否算入烏爾都語使用者:** While Hindi and Urdu are similar, the passage doesn't say native speaker counts change based on including Urdu speakers. It says speakers of both can *understand* each other.
*   **C: 是否算入能理解該語言的人:** The passage distinguishes between native speakers and those who can *understand* the language - understanding doesn't affect the native speaker count.
*   **D: 是否算入能閱讀該語言的人:** The passage doesn't mention reading ability as a factor in counting native speakers.



"
以下哪項關於印地語和烏爾都語的陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **B: It們在書寫系統上不同**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Hindi and Urdu are very similar in vocabulary but differ in writing; people who speak both languages usually understand each other in everyday conversation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 兩種語言的使用者通常有隔閡** - The passage says they *understand* each other, not that there's a barrier.
*   **C: 它們在詞彙和書寫系統上相似** - The passage says they're similar in vocabulary *but different* in writing.
*   **D: 它們的詞彙不同** - The passage specifically states they're *very similar* in vocabulary.



"
關於韓文字母，以下事實何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 這個字母表最初的名字是湖南正音**.

Here's why:

The passage states the alphabet was initially named ""**訓民正音**"" (訓民正音), not ""湖南正音"".  All the other statements are directly supported by the text:

*   **A: 是在世宗統治初期發明的** - The text says it was invented during Sejong's reign (1418-1450), specifically 1444.
*   **C: 是由朝鮮王朝的第四代國王發明的** - The text states Sejong the Great, the 4th king of the Joseon Dynasty, invented it.
*   **D: 是特意發明的** - The text directly states Hangul is the only alphabet *deliberately* designed.



"
訓民正音字母表最終改名為什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 諺文**.

The passage states that the original name was ""訓民正音"" but then refers to it as ""諺文"" – implying 諺文 is the eventual name. The other options are either a person's name (世宗), a dynasty (朝鮮), or part of the original name (正音) but not the final name of the alphabet.
"
根據文章，哪些語言受到了梵語的影響？,"The correct answer is **D: 印度語言**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""梵語是一種非常複雜又豐富的語言，也是印度許多種現代語言的來源，好比拉丁語也是法語和西班牙語等歐洲語言之源頭一樣。"" This directly indicates that many modern Indian languages originated from Sanskrit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 拉丁語言 (Latin language):** The passage compares Sanskrit *to* Latin, but doesn't say Latin was influenced by Sanskrit.
*   **B: 歐洲語言 (European languages):** The passage uses European languages (French, Spanish) as an *example* of languages influenced by Latin, not Sanskrit.
*   **C: 古代語言 (Ancient languages):** While Sanskrit is an ancient language, the question asks which languages were *influenced by* it, not just which languages are ancient.



"
根據文章，梵文使用的減少是由於什麼原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 階級制度 (caste system)**.

The passage states: ""梵文因階級制度而逐漸消亡"" which translates to ""Vedic declined due to the caste system.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 複雜性 (complexity):** While the passage mentions Sanskrit is complex, it doesn't say this *caused* its decline.
*   **B: 雅利安人遷徙 (Aryan migration):** The passage states migration was a theory of its *origin*, not its decline.
*   **C: 拉丁語言 (Latin language):** Latin is used as an analogy to explain Sanskrit's influence, but doesn't relate to its decline.



"
根據文章，關於艾奧的重力，以下哪一項陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **D: 地球的重力對你的影響比艾奧的重力大**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""如果您站在艾奧的地面上，您的體重會比您在地球上的體重輕."" This directly implies Earth's gravity has a *greater* effect on you than Io's.
* **The example given:** A 200 lb person on Earth becomes 36 lb on Io, demonstrating a *reduction* in gravitational force.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **B & C:** The passage says you'll be *lighter* on Io because the gravity is *less*.  More gravity would mean more weight.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項陳述正確描述了月球的外層？,"The correct answer is **C: 遠側的月海可能較少**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""地殼在近端厚約七十公里，在遠端厚約一百公里."" (The crust is about seventy kilometers thick on the near side and about one hundred kilometers thick on the far side.)
* **The passage also states:** ""或許在近端因地殼較薄而有更多月海。此處的岩漿較容易浮到表面."" (Perhaps there are more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. The magma is easier to rise to the surface here.)

Therefore, if the far side has a *thicker* crust, it logically follows that it would have *fewer* maria (moon seas) because the magma would have a harder time breaking through.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 近側有更厚的地殼** - Incorrect. The passage states the near side has a *thinner* crust.
* **B: 高原下的地殼更薄** - Incorrect. The passage states the crust is *thicker* under the highlands.
* **D: 高原下的月海可能較少** - Incorrect. The passage doesn't directly link highlands to maria, only that the crust is thicker there.
"
根據文章，月球地殼最厚的地方在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **C: 在高地下 (On the highlands)**.

The passage states: ""It is thicker under the highlands."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在近側 (On the near side)** - The passage says the crust is *thinner* on the near side (around 70km).
* **B: 在月海較多的地方 (Where there are more maria)** - The passage states the crust is *thinner* under the maria.
* **D: 在月海下方 (Under the maria)** - Again, the passage says the crust is *thinner* under the maria.



"
根據文章，有些人相信以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命存在於其他星球上**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""有些則相信外星人或其他形式的生命可能存在於另一顆星球之上"" (Some believe aliens or other forms of life may exist on another planet). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 人類已經到過其他星球 (Humans have already been to other planets)** - The passage talks about *dreaming* of going to other planets, not having already done so.
* **B: 人類無法探索其他世界 (Humans cannot explore other worlds)** - The passage suggests it *might* happen in the future (""Perhaps someday your great-grandchildren..."").
* **D: 恆星之間的距離少於數兆英里 (The distance between stars is less than trillions of miles)** - The passage states the opposite: distances are *trillions* of miles.



"
越是遠離太陽中心，以下哪一項變得越薄？,"The correct answer is **C: 氣體 (gas)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""離太陽中心越遠，氣體就越稀薄。"" (The further away from the sun's center, the thinner the gas becomes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 電漿 (plasma):** While the sun *is* made of plasma, the passage doesn't state its density changes with distance from the center.
*   **B: 火 (fire):**  ""Fire"" is a somewhat imprecise term in this context, but it's not stated to become thinner with distance. It's a general description of the sun's energetic nature.
*   **D: 地殼 (crust):** The passage specifically states the sun *doesn't have* a crust like Earth.



"
根據文章，太陽的哪一部分可以從地球上看到？,"The correct answer is **C: 光球 (photosphere)**.

The passage states: ""We see the outermost layer of the Sun called the 'photosphere', meaning 'light sphere'.""  This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 地殼 (crust)** - The passage specifically states the sun *doesn't* have a crust like Earth.
*   **B: 電漿 (plasma)** - While the sun *is* made of plasma, the passage doesn't say we can *see* the plasma directly.
*   **D: 中心 (center)** - We cannot see the center of the sun. The passage states gas gets thinner further from the center.



"
以下哪一項觀察證實了哥白尼的理論？,"The correct answer is **A: 金星的圓缺變化 (Venus's phases)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""金星盈虧證實了哥白尼的理論──行星繞著太陽旋轉"" which translates to ""Venus's phases confirmed Copernicus's theory - that planets revolve around the sun.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 金星凌日 (Venus transit of the sun)** - While interesting, the passage doesn't say the transit *confirmed* the theory, only that it was *observed*.
* **C: 太陽與金星的相似之處 (Similarities between the sun and Venus)** - The passage doesn't discuss any similarities.
* **D: 太陽與月亮的相似之處 (Similarities between the sun and the moon)** - The passage doesn't discuss any similarities.



"
1610 年，伽利略·伽利萊觀察到了以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **B: 金星的圓缺變化 (Venus' phases)**.

The passage specifically states: ""大約三千年後，1610 年義大利天文學家伽利略·伽利萊使用望遠鏡觀察到金星和月亮一樣有圓缺變化。"" (Approximately three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus, like the moon, had phases.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 月亮面向太陽的一側 (The side of the moon facing the sun)** - While the passage *explains* why Venus (and the moon) have phases - because of the sun's light - it doesn't state that Galileo observed *that side* specifically.
*   **C: 行星繞太陽運轉 (Planets revolving around the sun)** - Galileo's observation *supported* Copernicus' theory, but he didn't directly observe planets revolving around the sun in 1610. He observed phases that provided evidence for that theory.
*   **D: 金星凌日 (Venus transit)** - The passage states that Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus in 1639, *not* Galileo in 1610.



"
根據文章，亞馬遜河從哪裡匯集水？,"The correct answer is **A: 較小的河流**.

The passage states: ""亞馬遜河主流長 6,387 公里（3,980 英里），匯集了來自數千條小型河流的河水。"" (The Amazon River mainstream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 最長的河流 (The longest rivers):** The passage doesn't say the Amazon collects water from *the longest* rivers, just smaller ones.
* **C: 海洋 (The ocean):**  The Amazon *flows into* the ocean, it doesn't collect water from it.
* **D: 第二大河 (The second largest river):** The passage mentions the Amazon's volume is eight times that of the second largest river, but doesn't say it collects water *from* it.



"
何者並非亞馬遜河造就的榮譽？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是最長的河流 (It is the longest river)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Amazon is the *second* longest river, not the longest.
*   The passage explicitly states it is the largest river by water volume.
*   The passage explicitly states it is the widest river.
*   The passage explicitly states it is the second longest river.

Therefore, the only statement that is **not** an honor attributed to the Amazon River in the text is that it's the longest river."
文章提到的哪個行業別雇用的委內瑞拉人最少？,"正確答案是 **C: 石油業**。

文章明確指出「僅管只有百分之一的人口在石油業工作」。其他行業的比例分別是：

*   服務業：三分之二 (約 66%)
*   工業：將近四分之一 (約 25%)
*   農業：五分之一 (20%)

因此，石油業雇用的比例最低。"
根據文章，以下哪個行業雇用的委內瑞拉人最多？,"The correct answer is **A: 服務業**.

The passage states that ""two-thirds of the Venezuelan workforce is employed in the service sector"". This is the largest proportion of the workforce compared to the other options:

*   農業: 1/5 (20%)
*   工業: nearly 1/4 (approximately 25%)
*   石油業: 1%

Therefore, the service sector employs the most Venezuelans."
根據文章，融合可以讓恆星做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 散發光和熱 (emit light and heat)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""星星會發出光和熱，這是因為氫原子會在融合形成質量更重的元素時產生能量。"" (Stars emit light and heat because hydrogen atoms generate energy when they fuse to form heavier elements.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 形成更重的元素 (form heavier elements)** - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the passage states this is *how* stars emit light and heat, not the primary thing fusion allows stars to do.
* **B: 建造融合反應器 (build fusion reactors)** - The passage says scientists are *trying* to build reactors, not that fusion *allows* stars to do so.
* **D: 創造氫原子 (create hydrogen atoms)** - The passage states fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, not creates them.



"
一個有用的融合反應器會創造以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **D: 能量 (Energy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...產生能量 (produces energy)."" It directly links fusion to the creation of energy, just like stars.
* **The question asks:** What a useful fusion reactor would *create*.  The goal of a fusion reactor is to *generate* energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 氫 (Hydrogen):**  Fusion *uses* hydrogen as fuel, it doesn't create it.
* **B: 星星 (Stars):** A reactor is trying to *mimic* stars, but doesn't create stars themselves.
* **C: 原子 (Atoms):** Fusion creates *different* atoms (heavier elements), but that's a result of the process, not the primary thing the reactor is designed to produce.



"
水的化學成份是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 兩個氫原子和一個氧原子**.

The passage explicitly states: ""水是由兩個氫原子和一個氧原子組成的。"" (Water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).
"
當水改變形態時，什麼東西會保持不變？,"The correct answer is **A: 分子結構 (Molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""不論是氣體、液體或固體型態，都有相同的分子結構。(Regardless of whether it is gaseous, liquid, or solid, it has the same molecular structure.)"" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 密度 (Density):** The passage states liquid nitrogen *has* a higher density than gaseous nitrogen, meaning density *changes*.
* **C: 物理狀態 (Physical state):** The passage is *about* changes in physical state, and specifically says that physical state *changes*.
* **D: 液態氮 (Liquid nitrogen):** This is a specific example used in the passage, but not what *remains constant* when water changes form.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是十三個州試圖實施某些法律時的問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 國家當局的嚴格監督**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the central government under the Articles of Confederation was *weak* and lacked power. It did **not** have strict oversight. In fact, it *relied* on state authorities to enforce laws because it had no executive branch.
*   **B: 國會內部缺乏權力** is directly stated in the passage (""Congress lacked the power to tax..."").
*   **C: 要求一致同意的修正案** is also directly stated (""Amendments required unanimous consent of all states..."").
*   **D: 一個不存在的國家行政部門** is mentioned as a deficiency (""...no national executive or judicial branch..."").

Therefore, strict oversight by national authorities was *not* a problem; the opposite was true."
根據文章，以下哪一種陳述正確反映了中央政府在獨立戰爭期間的狀態？,"The correct answer is **C: 州代表缺席**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""their representatives were often absent."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 稅收是由國會和州當局執行的:** The passage states Congress *lacked the power to tax*. It did not share tax authority with states.
* **B: 依賴國會的權威來修正章程:** The passage says amendments required *unanimous consent of all states*, not just the authority of Congress.
* **D: 中央政府由兩個主要組成部分構成:** The passage says Congress was the *only* institution of the central government, not that it was comprised of two parts.



"
獨立宣言背面的文字是如何寫的？,"The correct answer is **C: 上下顛倒 (Upside down)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""文字是以上下顛倒方式寫在底部"" (The text is written upside down at the bottom). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 用大字體 (In large font):** The passage doesn't mention the size of the font.
* **B: 以代碼寫成 (Written in code):** The passage states it's text identifying the document, not a code.
* **D: 用小字體 (In small font):** The passage doesn't mention the size of the font.



"
新加坡因以下哪個方面聞名？,"The correct answer is **A: 城市綠化 (City Greening)**.

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that Singapore was transformed into a ""tropical garden city"" with the help of the Singapore Botanic Gardens' expertise. The selection of a flower as the national flower further reinforces this focus on horticulture and greenery. Therefore, Singapore is best known for its efforts in city greening.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: 徒步旅行 (Hiking)**: While Singapore has some hiking trails, it's not a primary reason for its fame.
*   **C: 冒險運動 (Adventure Sports)**: Singapore is not widely known for adventure sports.
*   **D: 表演藝術 (Performing Arts)**: Singapore has a growing performing arts scene, but it's not its defining characteristic.



"
什麼是卓錦萬代蘭？,"正確答案是 **B: 一種花卉**

理由：

在原文中提到「1981 年，一種蘭花雜交種「卓錦萬代蘭」被獲選為該國國花。」 蘭花是一種花卉，因此卓錦萬代蘭也是一種花卉。

其他選項錯誤的原因：

*   **A: 一個島嶼** - 卓錦萬代蘭是花卉，不是島嶼。
*   **C: 一個植物園** - 新加坡植物園協助將島嶼變成花園城市，但卓錦萬代蘭本身不是植物園。
*   **D: 一個國家紀念碑** - 雖然國花通常具有紀念意義，但原文沒有提及卓錦萬代蘭被指定為國家紀念碑。"
根據文章，吉薩金字塔的哪個特質可能不會讓新王國時期的埃及人感到驚奇？,"The correct answer is **A: It們的年代**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed because the pyramids were *over a thousand years old*.** This implies the age *would* be surprising.
* The passage specifically highlights the **scale (size)** and **exceptional technology** used in the construction of the Giza pyramids as unmatched (""unrivaled in scale and technological prowess""). This means scale and building methods *would* be surprising.
* The use of **stone** was a characteristic of all pyramids throughout the Old Kingdom, so it wouldn't be particularly amazing to the New Kingdom Egyptians - they would know pyramids were built of stone.

Therefore, the *only* characteristic that wouldn't likely cause surprise is their age, as the passage specifically points out the age was the source of wonder.
"
根據文章，草食動物在追求雨水時從哪裡出發？,"The correct answer is **B: 北邊山丘** (Northern hills).

The passage states: ""每年十月左右，都有將近 150 萬隻草食動物為了雨水，會從**北邊的山丘**跨越馬拉河..."" (Every October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores cross the Mara River from the **northern hills** in pursuit of rain...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 西部平原** (Western plains): The animals *migrate to* the southern plains, not from them.
*   **C: 南部平原** (Southern plains): They migrate *to* the southern plains, not from them.
*   **D: 西部山丘** (Western hills): The passage specifically mentions *northern* hills.



"
根據文章，食草動物在四月左右的某個時候離開哪個區域？,"The correct answer is **B: 南部平原 (Southern Plains)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""每年十月左右，都有將近 150 萬隻草食動物為了雨水，會從北邊的山丘跨越馬拉河，遷移至南方的平原。四月左右的雨季後，牠們再次跨過馬拉河，然後經由西部回到北方。""

This directly says the animals leave the *southern plains* around April.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 塞倫蓋蒂區域 (Serengeti Region):**  The Serengeti Region is the overall area where the migration happens, not where they *leave from* in April.
*   **C: 馬拉河 (Mara River):** The Mara River is crossed *during* the migration, not a place they depart from.
*   **D: 馬賽馬拉國家保護區 (Masai Mara National Reserve):**  While part of the Serengeti Region, it's not explicitly stated they leave *from* here in April. They move *towards* it initially.



"
海獅計畫入侵了哪個國家？,"The correct answer is **B: 英國**.

The passage states that Germany began preparing to invade the **British Isles** with ""Operation Sea Lion."" Therefore, the target of the invasion was Britain.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 德國** - Germany was the *attacker*, not the target.
*   **C: 法國** - The passage states the war to conquer France *ended*, meaning France wasn't the target of Operation Sea Lion.
*   **D: 波蘭** - Poland was invaded earlier in WWII, before the events described in this passage.



"
德國把對英國的攻擊稱為什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 海獅計畫** (Sea Lion Plan).

The passage explicitly states: ""德國給那次攻擊取了「海獅計畫」的代號。"" (Germany gave that attack the code name ""Sea Lion Plan."")

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 敦克爾克** (Dunkirk) - Dunkirk was the location of a British evacuation, not the name of the attack.
* **C: 德國海軍** (Kriegsmarine/German Navy) - This is the name of the German navy, not the attack.
* **D: 皇家海軍** (Royal Navy) - This is the British navy, not the attack.



"
哪一項不是義大利佔領非洲國家計劃中的必要步驟？,"The correct answer is **B: 建造額外的船隻**.

Here's why:

The passage states Italy already had four new ships built *just before* the war. It doesn't mention a need to build *additional* ships as part of their plan to invade Africa. The passage explicitly states their ships should *not* be involved in anything other than taking out British forces in Egypt.

The other options *are* listed as necessary steps:

*   **A: 除掉在埃及的船隻** - This is directly stated as a necessary action.
*   **C: 建立軍隊可用的跳板** - This is stated as necessary to allow troops to cross the Mediterranean.
*   **D: 摧毀英國的基地** - This is mentioned alongside taking out ships in Egypt.



"
根據文章，義大利戰爭的主要目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 佔領非洲國家**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""義大利的主要目標是非洲國家 (Italy's main goal is African countries)."" While the other options are mentioned in relation to achieving that goal (removing British ships from Egypt being a *step* towards occupying Africa, and improving their navy being a general background point), they aren't the *main* goal itself."
誰與入侵者建立友好關係？,"The correct answer is **B: 維希法國 (Vichy France)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""these French people [Vichy] in 1940 got along peacefully with the Germans and collaborated with the invaders rather than fighting against them.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 德國人 (Germans)** - The Germans were the invaders, not the ones forming friendly relationships with them.
*   **C: 美國人 (Americans)** - The Americans were *liberating* France, not collaborating with the invaders.
*   **D: 自由法國 (Free French)** - The Free French actively *fought against* the Germans and Vichy government."
哪些盟軍參與了龍騎兵行動？,"The correct answer is **A: 美國和自由法國 (United States and Free France)**.

The text specifically states: ""In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 維希法國和美國 (Vichy France and United States):** The text describes Vichy France as *being liberated* by the Allies, not participating *with* them.
* **C: 德國和法國 (Germany and France):** Germany was the enemy, and Vichy France was collaborating *with* Germany, not fighting alongside them.
* **D: 美國和德國 (United States and Germany):** The US and Germany were opposing forces.



"
哪項技術的發展導致潛水艇開始潛入水中行駛？,"The correct answer is **D: 雷達**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""隨著雷達的研發開始和變得越來越精確後，潛水艇被迫潛入水中以避免被看見。"" This directly links the development of radar to the change in submarine behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U 艇** - U-boats were *driven* into the water, they didn't *cause* the change.
*   **B: 射擊範圍** - Shooting range isn't mentioned as a factor in why submarines began to submerge.
*   **C: 駕駛** - Skillful driving (操控) didn't necessitate submerging; it just allowed them to operate effectively *while* submerged.



"
在最初的使用中，潛艇在哪個區域的航程有限？,"The correct answer is **C: 射擊 (shooting/range)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...early submarines were slow and had **very limited range**.""  ""Range"" in this context refers to how far a submarine could travel *or* how far its weapons (like torpedoes) could reach – its shooting range.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 駕駛 (driving)** - The passage mentions Germans were good at *driving* U-boats, but doesn't say their initial use was limited in driving ability.
*   **B: 移動 (moving)** - While they were slow, ""limited range"" isn't directly about the *act* of moving, but how *far* they could move.
*   **D: 操作 (operation)** - Similar to driving, the passage doesn't state a limitation in the general operation of the submarine, but its capabilities.



"
根據文章，是誰違反了協議？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 蘇聯人 (Soviet people)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""超過 80 萬名蘇聯紅軍違反《里加和約》、《波蘇互不侵犯協定》和其它雙邊與多邊的國際協定入侵波蘭東部..."" This directly indicates the Soviet Union (蘇聯) violated the agreements.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 波蘭人 (Poles)** - The passage describes Poland *being* invaded, not violating agreements.
*   **B: 羅馬尼亞人 (Romanians)** - Romania is mentioned as a location for a potential regrouping, but not as a violator of agreements.
*   **C: 烏克蘭人 (Ukrainians)** - While Ukraine was later occupied, the passage states the *Soviet* army entered Ukraine, and doesn't accuse Ukrainians of breaking agreements.



"
以下哪項不是由紅軍執行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 在橋頭堡進行重組 (Reorganizing at the bridgehead)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Poland was *planning* to reorganize at the bridgehead in Romania, but their plans were ruined by the Soviet invasion.** The passage specifically says the red army *prevented* this from happening.
* **A: 建立烏克蘭戰線 (Establishing the Ukrainian Front)** - The passage directly states the Red Army formed fronts in Ukraine.
* **B: 入侵東部地區 (Invading eastern regions)** - The passage clearly states the Red Army invaded eastern Poland.
* **D: 違反條約 (Violating treaties)** - The passage explicitly mentions the Red Army violated multiple treaties.

Therefore, reorganizing at the bridgehead was a Polish plan, not an action *carried out by* the Red Army.



"
義大利第十軍團的工兵總隊長發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **C: He was captured by the British.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In an ambush east of Bardia, British troops captured the commander of the engineers of the Italian Tenth Army, General Rastuccia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He was captured at Capuzzo.** - While Capuzzo is mentioned, Rastuccia was captured *east of Bardia*, not at Capuzzo.
*   **B: He was killed at Tobruk.** - It was Italo Balbo who died at Tobruk.
*   **D: He was killed by friendly fire.** - It was Italo Balbo who was killed by friendly fire.



"
義大利空軍元帥伊塔洛·巴爾博在哪裡被殺？,"The correct answer is **D: 圖卜魯格**.

The passage states: ""On June 28, the Governor of Libya—clearly a successor to Mussolini, Marshal Italo Balbo, was killed by friendly fire while landing at Tobruk.""
"
根據文章，以下哪種技巧是西藏冥想的重要部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 觀想觀想神佛 (Visualizing deities)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""藏傳佛教的冥想核心是本尊瑜伽。透過觀想神佛，淨化所有的能量通道，啟動脈輪，建立開悟意識。"" (The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing deities, all energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is established.)

While the passage mentions breathing exercises (呼吸運動), mantra recitation (曼特羅禱文), and yoga postures (瑜伽姿勢) as part of Kundalini Yoga *within* Tibetan Buddhism, it specifically identifies **visualizing deities** as the *core* of Tibetan meditation.



"
根據文章，脈輪在西藏冥想「核心」期間是如何被啟動的？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過觀想神佛**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""藏傳佛教的冥想核心是本尊瑜伽。透過觀想神佛，淨化所有的能量通道，啟動脈輪，建立開悟意識。"" This directly links the activation of chakras (脈輪) to visualizing deities (觀想神佛) within the core practice of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 透過各種瑜伽姿勢** - While Kundalini yoga *uses* postures, the passage doesn't state this is how chakras are activated in the *core* of Tibetan meditation (which is Bonzon Yoga).
*   **C: 透過重複曼特羅禱文** - Mantras are mentioned as part of Kundalini yoga, but not specifically for chakra activation in the core meditation practice.
*   **D: 練習呼吸運動** - Breathing exercises are also part of Kundalini yoga, but again, not directly linked to chakra activation in the core meditation described.



"
在節目中，誰獻上了第二首拜讚歌？,"The correct answer is **D: 傑·香卡·喬杜理**.

The text states: ""歌手桑傑‧夏滿揭開了晚場的序幕，隨後登場的是傑‧香卡‧喬杜理。"" This means傑·香卡·喬杜理 performed the second devotional song."
根據文章，誰在供奉食品時演唱了一首拜讚歌？,"The correct answer is **A: 拉卡·辛**.

The text states: ""拉克‧辛格也獻唱了拜讚歌 chhappan bhog。"" and later, ""拉克辛也獻上 56 饗聖歌."" Chhappan bhog refers to the 108 dishes offered to Baba Shyam, so Lakha Singh sang a devotional song while the food was being offered.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 傑·香卡·喬杜理** - He performed, but the text doesn't say he sang while food was being offered.
*   **C: 錫呂·希亞姆** - Shri Shyam is the deity being worshipped, not a performer.
*   **D: 桑傑·夏滿** - He opened the evening but is not linked to the food offering."
晚上的倒數第二場表演是什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 安納托利亞之火**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""在結尾，土耳其舞蹈團體「安納托利亞之火」 表演了「特洛伊」這個戲碼。"" This means ""安納托利亞之火"" performed right before the end of the event, making it the second to last performance.
"
亞歷山大·沙費納是什麼國籍？,"The correct answer is **D: 義大利**.

The text specifically states ""亞歷山大‧沙費納和希臘歌手哈麗絲‧亞力克西烏同臺演出"" and identifies him as an Italian tenor (男高音).
"
根據文章，以下哪個敘述不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: 聖塔克拉拉發生火災 (Santa Clara had a fire)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage mentions high temperatures in Santa Clara, but **no fire** is mentioned.
*   **B** is correct: The passage states people were stuck on a rollercoaster.
*   **C** is correct: The passage says waiting passengers were able to rehydrate (given water).
*   **D** is correct: The passage clearly states it took ""at least an hour"" to rescue the first person.

Therefore, only option A is not supported by the information in the text."
根據文章，誰對於不舒適的熱度發表評論？,"The correct answer is **B: 消防隊長**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""消防隊長史考特·考恩斯說：「那天聖塔克拉拉非常炎熱，氣溫為華氏 90 幾度。」"" This directly shows that the fire captain (消防隊長) Scott Cohens commented on the heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 遊樂設施操作員 (Amusement park operators)** - The passage doesn't mention any comments from them.
*   **C: 乘客們 (Passengers)** - The passage states passengers were rehydrating, but doesn't quote them *commenting* on the heat.
*   **D: 警察局長 (Police Chief)** - The passage doesn't mention a police chief.



"
哪裡因海嘯活動而停電？,"The correct answer is **A: 東加**.

The text states: ""東加並未回報任何重大損壞或傷亡，但據稱暫時的電力中斷妨礙了東加相關單位接收太平洋海嘯警報中心 (PTWC) 發出之海嘯警報。"" This directly links power outages to Tonga.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 紐埃:** The text states there was tsunami *activity recorded* near Niue, but not a power outage.
*   **C: 夏威夷的學校:** Schools in Hawaii were closed as a precaution *after* the warning was lifted, not because of a power outage caused by the tsunami.
*   **D: 帕果帕果:** The text states tsunami activity was *recorded* near Pago Pago, but doesn't mention a power outage there."
根據文章，東加因停電受到了什麼影響？,"The correct answer is **D: 當局無法收到相關警報**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""儘管警告解除了，位於夏威夷海岸線上或附近的十四所學校仍然全數在星期三全日停課。 東加並未回報任何重大損壞或傷亡，但據稱暫時的電力中斷妨礙了東加相關單位接收太平洋海嘯警報中心 (PTWC) 發出之海嘯警報.""  This directly indicates that the power outage prevented Tonga's authorities from receiving the tsunami warnings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 有一些損害報告** - The passage states there were *no* reports of major damage or casualties.
*   **B: 當局沒有收到解除警報的消息** - While related, the specific problem was receiving *any* alerts, not just the all-clear.
*   **C: 海平面讀數受到影響** - The passage mentions sea level readings indicating a tsunami, but this refers to observations *detecting* the tsunami, not being *affected* by Tonga's situation.



"
警方何時能使用雷達槍測量強尼瑞德的駕駛速度？,"The correct answer is **A: 他以 160 公里/小時的速度行駛時**.

The passage specifically states: ""Because the Black Beauty car was too low, New Zealand police were unable to get a speed reading with their speed guns until the car slowed to 160km/h, when police were able to get one reading."" 

This means they could *only* get a reading when the speed was 160 km/h.
"
根據文章，為什麼紐西蘭警方很難測量強尼瑞德的速度？,"The correct answer is **B: 車子的高度非常低 (The car was very low to the ground)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Because the Black Beauty car was too low, New Zealand police were unable to get a speed reading with their speed guns until the car slowed to 160 km/h.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 他的行駛速度低於 160 公里/小時 (His driving speed was below 160 km/h):** The text says they *eventually* measured 160 km/h, meaning he was going faster initially.
*   **C: 他只開車過橋七次 (He only drove over the bridge seven times):** The number of times he drove over the bridge is irrelevant to why police couldn't measure his speed.
*   **D: 奧克蘭海灣大橋非常老舊 (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old):** The age of the bridge isn't mentioned as a factor.



"
與比尤特相關的地震集中在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **B: 向南 40 英里**.

The passage states the epicenter was approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) *south* of Butte.
"
在阿布格萊布監獄的暴亂期間發生了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 監獄火災 (Prison fire)**.

The prompt states that the Abu Ghraib prison ""was ravaged by fire"" during a riot. While the prison is *known* for the abuse that occurred there (A, C), the question specifically asks what *happened during the riot*, and the answer is the fire.
"
伊拉克監獄為何聲名狼藉？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 揭發了虐待囚犯的行為 (Revealed acts of prisoner abuse)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the prison ""became notorious after acts of prisoner abuse by US forces"". While a fire did occur (A), and the US did take over the prison (B), and there were riots (C), the *reason* it's notorious is because of the abuse that was revealed. 

Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer directly supported by the text."
在茂宜島的戰爭紀念館體育場將舉行哪種活動？,"The correct answer is **C: 音樂會 (Concert)**.

The passage states ""樂團取消了在茂宜島戰爭紀念體育場的演出 (The band cancelled their performance at the Maui War Memorial Stadium)"". This clearly indicates a concert was planned.
"
誰最終對活動取消做出了解釋？,"The correct answer is **B: 管理公司**.

Here's why:

The passage states that HK Management Inc. (the band's management company) *initially* didn't give a reason, but *then* explained the cancellation was due to logistical issues.  Therefore, the management company provided the explanation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 樂團** - The band apologized, but the *explanation* came from their management.
*   **C: 戰爭紀念館的所有者** - The passage doesn't mention the owners of the venue giving an explanation.
*   **D: 粉絲們** - The fans received the apology, but didn't provide the explanation.



"
比什凱克的幾位居民認為誰應對搶劫負責？,"The correct answer is **C: 抗議人士**.

The passage states: ""Several Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the south for the looting."" 

Therefore, the residents believe the protesters from the south are responsible.
"
誰將搶劫的責任歸咎於南方的抗議人士？,"The correct answer is **A: 比什凱克居民**.

The text specifically states: ""幾名比斯凱克居民譴責來自南方的抗議人士違法亂紀。"" (Several Bishkek residents condemned protesters from the south for the lawlessness.) This directly links the blame to the residents of Bishkek.
"
鈴響公司何時經歷了銷售成長？,"The correct answer is **A: 在《創業鯊魚幫》節目上露面後**.

The passage specifically states: ""西米諾夫表示當他 2013 年在《創業鯊魚幫》節目上露面後，銷售額提高了..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2013 年獲得資金後** - The passage states the *Shark Tank* judges *rejected* investing.
* **C: 在 QVC 購物頻道上露面後** - While the passage mentions a QVC appearance, it doesn't say sales increased *because* of it.
* **D: 解決了與 ADT 的訴訟後** - The passage only mentions a settlement, not a sales increase related to it.



"
傑米·西米諾夫何時決定創辦鈴響公司的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在意識到自己的門鈴不適用後 (After realizing his doorbell didn't work)**.

The passage states that Jamie Siminoff founded Ring *because* he couldn't hear the doorbell in his garage workshop. This means the decision to found the company stemmed from this realization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the *Shark Tank* appearance increased sales, it didn't *cause* the founding of the company.
* **C:** He was *rejected* for funding on *Shark Tank*, so he didn't found the company after receiving funds.
* **D:** The QVC appearance happened *after* the company was already founded.



"
每一集《彩虹閱讀》都為孩子們提供了什麼建議？,"The correct answer is **D: 書籍 (Books)**.

The passage states: ""Each episode of the program would also offer suggestions for books children should look for when they go to the library.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 電視節目 (Television program):** While the show *is* a television program, it doesn't *suggest* television programs to children.
* **B: 當地圖書館 (Local library):** The show encourages children to *go* to the library, but doesn't offer suggestions *of* the library itself.
* **C: 主題 (Theme):** The show focuses *on* themes, but doesn't suggest themes to children.



"
是什麼導致《彩虹閱讀》系列節目的停播？,"The correct answer is **A: 資金不足**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states, ""包括約翰葛蘭特在內的一些人認為，財政困難及電視教育節目理念的改變，促使此系列畫下句點。"" which translates to ""Including John Grant, some people believe that financial difficulties and a change in the concept of television educational programs led to the end of the series.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 缺乏艾美獎 (Lack of Emmy Awards):** The show actually *won* over 24 Emmy Awards, so this is the opposite of the truth.
*   **C: 約翰·格蘭特的意見 (John Grant's opinion):** While John Grant is quoted, his opinion is presented as *part* of the reason, not the sole cause. The passage highlights financial difficulties as a key factor.
*   **D: 《羅傑斯先生的鄰居》節目的成功 (The success of *Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood*):** The passage notes the show's long run *relative* to these other shows, but doesn't suggest their success caused its cancellation.



"
以下哪一項不是阿姆斯特丹和博物館官員對樹的爭辯之一？,"The correct answer is **B: It should be preserved**.

Here's why:

* **P states the Amsterdam government and Anne Frank House staff wanted to *cut down* the tree** because of the risks it posed (fungus, potential to fall, public safety). This is the opposite of wanting to preserve it.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the dispute:

* **A: It will certainly fall over:** The passage explicitly states the tree is ""likely to fall"".
* **C: It is infected with fungus:** The passage directly states the tree is ""infected with fungus"".
* **D: It poses a threat to public health:** The passage states the tree ""could endanger public health"".

Therefore, the disagreement wasn't *whether* to save the tree, but *whether* it was safe enough to keep standing.
"
根據英國皇家防止虐待動物協會的首席檢查員的說法，以下何者需要進行標準檢查？,"The correct answer is **D: 屠宰場 (Slaughterhouses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the RSPCA is calling for *mandatory CCTV in all Australian slaughterhouses* and that the chief inspector believes in ""universal monitoring *of slaughterhouses* and inspections."" The focus of the call for standard checks is on the places where animals are slaughtered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 閉路電視攝影機 (CCTV cameras)** - While CCTV is *part* of the proposal, they aren't what need to be checked; they are the tool used for checking.
*   **B: 任何養殖工作者 (Any farm workers)** - The passage mentions workers, but the focus isn't on checking *them* directly, but on ensuring their actions toward animals are monitored.
*   **C: 監視設施 (Monitoring facilities)** - This is too vague. The specific facilities needing monitoring are slaughterhouses.



"
根據文章，什麼可以幫助加強澳洲屠宰場工人對動物福利的重視？,"The correct answer is **A: Installing CCTV cameras**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Surveillance would send a strong message to those working in these facilities that animal welfare is a priority."" This directly links CCTV cameras (surveillance) to increasing the importance of animal welfare among slaughterhouse workers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mandatory meetings with the RSPCA:** The passage doesn't mention mandatory meetings.
* **C: Regular inspections of slaughterhouses:** While inspections are mentioned as something the RSPCA wants *along with* monitoring, the quote specifically highlights the impact of *surveillance* (CCTV) on worker behavior.
* **D: Supervision by the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation):** The ABC is only mentioned as the news source reporting on the story, not as a supervisory body.



"
根據文章，被捕的人從事什麼職業？,"The correct answer is **A: 學生 (Student)**.

The passage states the arrested individual is ""a student suspected in the March 21 school shooting."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 明尼蘇達州《明星論壇報》記者 (Minnesota Star Tribune reporter):** The newspaper *reported* on the arrest, but the arrested person wasn't a reporter.
* **C: 部落酋長 (Tribal Chief):** The passage states the arrested person is the *son* of the tribal chief, not the chief himself.
* **D: 紅湖當局 (Red Lake authorities):** The authorities made the arrest, but the arrested person wasn't part of the authorities.



"
根據文章，另一名嫌疑犯被捕的消息傳開時，有多少名受害者的喪禮正在舉行？,"The correct answer is **B: Three**.

The text states: ""...Jeff Weiss and the funerals of three of the nine victims have been postponed..."" This directly answers the question."
作為對抗議活動的回應，哪個國家沒有繼續執行他們簽署的反仿冒貿易協定？,"The correct answer is **B: 波蘭**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""波蘭在上個月簽署了反仿冒貿易協定，並在國內引發大型抗議，導致波蘭政府決定暫不批准該協議."" This directly indicates Poland halted the implementation of the agreement due to protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 德國:** The text mentions protests *in* Germany, but not that Germany stopped implementing the agreement.
* **C: 蘇格蘭:**  Protests occurred in Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow), but the text doesn't state Scotland has any control over the trade agreement.
* **D: 立陶宛:** The text mentions protests *in* Lithuania (Vilnius), but not that Lithuania stopped implementing the agreement.



"
根據文章，以下哪個國家決定推遲加入反仿冒貿易協定的程序？,"The correct answer is **D: 拉脫維亞**.

The text specifically states: ""拉脫維亞及斯洛伐克都推遲加入反仿冒貿易協定的程序。"" (Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the procedures for joining the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 愛沙尼亞** - The article mentions protests in Tallinn (Estonia), but not that Estonia postponed joining the agreement.
*   **B: 立陶宛** - The article mentions protests in Vilnius (Lithuania), but not that Lithuania postponed joining the agreement.
*   **C: 蘇格蘭** - The article mentions protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow (Scotland), but not that Scotland postponed joining the agreement (Scotland is part of the UK, and the agreement is being considered at a national level).



"
有多少人因為 iPod 的過熱事件而受傷？,"The correct answer is **A: 4 人**.

The passage states that 4 people sustained minor burns due to the overheating iPods. The other numbers refer to the number of incidents reported, not the number of people injured."
是誰說過熱事件不是很嚴重？,"The correct answer is **D: 蘋果公司 (Apple)**.

The passage states: ""Apple reported another 34 overheating incidents to them last week, claiming these incidents were ‘not serious’."" 

Therefore, Apple is the one who stated the overheating incidents were not serious.
"
在賈伯斯的演講中，他說蘋果要重塑什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 手機 (Phones)**.

The text explicitly states he said, ""今天蘋果將重新打造電話 (Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone)..."".  While he also claimed they would make history, the *thing* he was reinventing was the phone.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 歷史 (History)** - He said they'd *make* history, not reinvent it.
* **C: 公司 (Company)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about reinventing the company.
* **D: 技術 (Technology)** - While a phone involves technology, he specifically focused on the phone itself.



"
賈伯斯兩小時演講的目的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 推出一款新的手機** (To launch a new mobile phone).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""今天蘋果將重新打造電話，我們會在今天創造歷史"" which translates to ""Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, we are going to create history today."" This clearly indicates the purpose of the speech was to introduce a new phone (the iPhone). The passage also describes him pulling the iPhone *from his pocket*, further solidifying this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 推出一款新的平板電腦** (To launch a new tablet): The passage doesn't mention anything about a tablet.
*   **B: 推出一款新的電腦** (To launch a new computer): The passage specifically focuses on the phone.
*   **D: 宣布他的退休** (To announce his retirement): The passage focuses on a product launch, not a personal announcement."
克莉絲汀娜·費南德茲·德基希納在阿根廷劇院宣布了什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 她的總統候選人資格 (Her presidential candidacy)**.

The passage states she ""announced her intention to run for president"" at the Teatro Argentino. This directly translates to announcing her presidential candidacy.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 她打算競選參議員 (She intends to run for senator)** - The passage states she *is* a senator, not that she's running *for* senator.
* **C: 她布宜諾斯艾利斯省代表團的競選活動 (Her campaign for the Buenos Aires province delegation)** - While the theater was where she started her political journey related to that delegation, she wasn't announcing that *now*.
* **D: 她計劃辭去現任參議員職務 (She plans to resign from her current senatorial position)** - The passage does not mention any plans to resign."
克莉絲汀娜·費南德茲·德基希納在哪裡宣布她要參選？,"The correct answer is **C: 在離布宜諾斯艾利斯 31 英里遠的阿根廷劇院**. 

Here's why:

* The text states she announced her candidacy ""in the Argentina Theatre in La Plata, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrect - it says 31 miles *from* La Plata, not *to* La Plata.
* **B:** Incorrect - it specifically names the ""Argentina Theatre,"" not a ""Buenos Aires theatre.""
* **D:** Incorrect - The theatre is in La Plata, not Buenos Aires.



"
澳洲通訊及媒體局對《老大哥》的調查結果是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 沒有違反審查法 (Did not violate censorship laws)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ACMA found *《老大哥》節目卻沒有違反線上內容審查法 (the Big Brother program did not violate online content censorship laws)*. The reason given is technical – the video wasn't hosted on Big Brother's website.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 發現影片已儲存在《老大哥》的網站上 (Found the video was stored on Big Brother's website)** - The passage says the opposite; it wasn't stored there.
* **C: 違反了審查法 (Violated censorship laws)** - The passage specifically states they *did not* violate the laws.
* **D: 發現內容實體儲存在伺服器上 (Found content physically stored on a server)** - While the passage mentions content needing to be on a server to be regulated, it's stating *why* Big Brother wasn't liable, not what ACMA *found* about the content.



"
影片必須符合哪些決定因素才能看作是網路內容？,"The correct answer is **B: 必須實體儲存在伺服器上 (must be physically stored on a server)**.

The passage specifically states: ""however to be considered internet content, it must physically exist on a server."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 必須在網絡上流傳 (must be circulated on the network)** - While the video *was* circulated, that alone wasn't enough for ACMA to regulate it.
* **C: 不能儲存在網站上 (cannot be stored on a website)** - The passage states the opposite – the video *not* being on the show's website is *why* it wasn't regulated.
* **D: 必須獲得澳洲通訊及媒體局的批准 (must be approved by the Australian Communications and Media Authority)** - The passage doesn't mention needing ACMA approval to be considered internet content.



"
澳洲自由黨的領袖是誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 約翰·霍華德**.

The text states that Peter Costello is the most likely to *replace* John Howard as the leader (chairman) of the Liberal Party. This means John Howard is currently the leader.
"
為什麼澳洲還沒有核能產業？,"The most accurate answer based on the provided text is **A: 缺乏公眾支持 (Lack of public support)**.

Here's why:

The text states Costello says Australia *should* have nuclear power ""once it is commercial,"" and that he doesn't have a ""principled objection"" to it. This implies the barrier isn't cost, danger, or inherent controversy, but rather a waiting period until it's economically viable *and* presumably, acceptable to the public. While not explicitly stated, the fact he needs to frame it as ""once it's commercial"" suggests a pre-existing hesitancy, likely stemming from public opinion.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: 太有爭議 (Too controversial):**  While nuclear power is often debated, Costello's statement suggests he's open to it if economically feasible, implying it's not the core issue.
*   **C: 太危險 (Too dangerous):** The text doesn't mention safety concerns.
*   **D: 太昂貴 (Too expensive):** Costello specifically focuses on *commercial viability*, meaning cost is a factor, but not a fundamental block.  He suggests it's a matter of *when* it becomes affordable, not *if*.



"
哪位滑雪者在引導員的幫助下參加比賽？,"The correct answer is **C: 麥傑·克雷澤**.

The text states: ""波蘭男子視障滑雪選手麥傑·克雷澤和領滑員安娜·奧加辛斯卡在超級大迴轉中獲得第 13 名."" This indicates that Maciej Krajewski is a visually impaired skier who competes *with* a guide (Anna Ogasińska).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 安娜·約赫姆森** - Competed independently in women's standing alpine skiing.
*   **B: 朴宗石** - Competed independently in men's sitting alpine skiing.
*   **D: 安娜·奧加辛斯卡** - She is the *guide* for Maciej Krajewski, not the athlete needing assistance."
哪個國家在女子站姿滑雪超大曲道比賽中排名第十？,"The correct answer is **A: 芬蘭**.

The passage states: ""在昨天的女子站姿滑雪超大曲道比賽中獲得第九名之荷蘭選手安娜‧約赫姆森，以及同一賽事裡第十名的芬蘭選手卡蒂亞·薩利寧。"" (In yesterday's women's standing alpine giant slalom, Dutch athlete Anna Jochumsen finished ninth, and Finnish athlete Katja Salinen finished tenth.)
"
根據文章，關於布雷克的哪個說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: He admitted to the assault.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states he *denied* the assault.** (""The presenter, who was arrested at the scene, denied the assault..."") This directly contradicts option B.
* **A: He was arrested at the scene** is correct, stated in the first sentence.
* **C: He used a stick in the assault** is correct, as he claimed it was for self-defense (""claiming the stick was used to defend himself..."")
* **D: He claimed people threw bottles at him** is correct, (""...as many as 30 people were throwing bottles at him."")

Therefore, option B is the inaccurate statement about Blake according to the provided text.
"
根據文章，以下哪件事沒有發生在布雷克身上？,"The correct answer is **C: He was attacked with a stick.**

Here's why:

* **A: He was convicted of obstructing justice** - The text states ""Blake was also convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice.""
* **B: He was arrested** - The text states ""The presenter was arrested at the scene...""
* **D: He was told he might be imprisoned** - The text states the judge told Blake he ""almost certainly"" would be going to prison.
* **C: He was attacked with a stick** - The text says *he* used a stick for self-defense, claiming *others* were throwing bottles *at him*. It doesn't state he was attacked *with* a stick.

Therefore, the only event that didn't happen *to* Blake according to the text is being attacked with a stick.



"
聯合國的全球暖化經費不會用於什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 將技術帶到發展中國家**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the funds will be used for:**
    * 防洪房屋 (flood-proof housing)
    * 更佳的水資源管理 (better water resource management)
    * 農作物多樣化 (crop diversification)
    * Solving problems *resulting from* global warming.

* **The passage also mentions sharing technology with developing nations as a separate goal**, alongside saving forests.  It *doesn't* state the global warming fund will be used for this.

Therefore, sharing technology with developing nations is the only option *not* directly mentioned as a use for the global warming funds.



"
根據文章，聯合國希望拯救什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 剩餘的雨林 (remaining rainforests)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""峇里島議程中其他主題包括拯救世界上剩餘的森林..."" (Other topics on the Bali agenda included saving the world’s remaining forests...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 透過技術共享來節省資金 (Saving money through technology sharing)** - The passage mentions sharing technology *to help* developing nations, not to save money.
*   **B: 農作物 (Crops)** - While crop diversification is *supported* by the funding, the UN isn't trying to ""save"" crops themselves.
*   **D: 受到不良水資源管理影響的人們 (People affected by poor water resource management)** - Better water resource management is a *result* of the funding, not what the UN is trying to save."
以下哪項不是阿爾伯特·穆昌加認為仍需商定的事項？,"The correct answer is **A: 貝南共和國是否加入非洲大陸自由貿易區協定**.

Here's why:

The passage states Albert Muchanga *announced* Benin's impending joining of the AfCFTA. This means it wasn't something still being negotiated, but rather a done deal he was reporting on.

The passage *explicitly* states that original rules and tariff concessions are yet to be agreed upon. Therefore options C & D are things that still need negotiating.

Option B is incorrect because the passage states a start date for trade (July 1, 2020) has already been established, despite the ongoing negotiations.
"
根據文章，為什麼交易可以在七月開始？,"The correct answer is **B: 已經有足夠的規則和讓步架構**.

Here's why:

The passage states directly: ""But the framework we have put in place is sufficient for us to start trading on 1 July 2020."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage says Nigeria *plans* to join, but doesn't state its joining is *required* for trading to begin.
* **C:** Approval from the Commissioner is mentioned, but it's the framework itself, not just the approval, that allows for trading.
* **D:** The passage explicitly says they have *not* yet agreed on rules of origin and tariff concessions.



"
根據文章，亞特蘭大憲法報指責教育官員做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 沒有針對檢測到的內部問題採取行動**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""此報告顯示測驗分數進步速度之快令人難以置信，並指出學校有進行內部調查，但並未對結果採許行動。"" (This report showed the speed of test score improvement was incredible, and pointed out that the schools conducted internal investigations, but did not take action on the results.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 篡改亞特蘭大憲法報的報告** - The article says the *tests* were potentially tampered with, not the newspaper's report.
* **B: 未能創新城市教育** - The passage states she was *praised* for innovative urban education.
* **D: 報告的測試分數很低** - The issue wasn't low scores, but *rapidly improving* scores that raised suspicions.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，亞特蘭大憲法報的報告中沒有提到什麼？,"正確答案是 **C: 2013 年年度國家教育局長得主**。

理由如下：

*   文章提到她在 2009 年獲頒年度國家教育局長的頭銜，而問題詢問的是亞特蘭大憲法報的報告中 *沒有* 提到什麼。
*   文章明確說明了報告指出測驗分數進步速度之快令人難以置信 (A)，也提到了後來發現試卷經過竄改的證據 (B)。此外，文章也提到了她因創新城市教育而受到肯定 (D)。
*   因此，亞特蘭大憲法報的報告中並沒有提到 2013 年年度國家教育局長的得主，因為這件事發生在獲獎後幾年。

所以，選項 C 是最合適的答案。"
根據文章，哪些資訊在爆炸後得知？,"The correct answer is **D: Official death toll**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Partial reports of the official death toll are eight, official reports confirm as many as 30 injured; but the true number remains unknown."" This directly states information *learned after* the bombing about the number of deaths.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Final injury statistics:** The passage says the true number of injured is *unknown*, so final statistics haven't been learned.
*   **B: Buildings near the bomb blasts:** The passage mentions government buildings, but doesn't state this was learned *after* the explosion – it's part of the initial reporting.
*   **C: Whether additional bombs were detonated:** The passage states there were three *additional* bombs, meaning this information was known initially, not discovered afterward.



"
自 2017 年加入曼徹斯特城足球俱樂部以來，熱蘇斯參加了幾場比賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 53 場**.

The passage states: ""自此之後，這位巴西選手共為該球隊踢了 53 場球賽..."" (Since then, the Brazilian player has played a total of 53 games for the team...)
"
熱蘇斯因加入哪個俱樂部收取 £2700 萬英鎊的報酬？,"The correct answer is **B: 曼徹斯特城**.

The passage states Jesus *joined* Manchester City *for* a fee of £27 million.  The money went *to* Palmeiras (his previous club), but he received the fee *by joining* Manchester City.
"
關於旅館房客的哪個說法是不正確的？,"The correct answer is **D: 大多數房客來自聖城 (Most of the guests were from the holy city)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the guests were *mainly* from the United Arab Emirates (阿拉伯聯合大公國).** This directly contradicts the idea that most were from the holy city of Mecca itself.
* **A is correct:** The passage explicitly says they were visiting for the Hajj (朝覲).
* **B is correct:** Guests from the UAE are not local to Mecca.
* **C is correct:** The passage states they were there ""on the eve of the Hajj"" (朝覲前夕).



"
根據文章，以下哪個陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **C: 房客們在朝覲前夕到達那裡**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states the building housed pilgrims ""visiting the holy city ahead of the hajj"" (朝覲前夕造訪聖城), meaning they arrived before the pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 無人死亡** - The passage clearly states ""at least 15 people have died"" (至少 15 人死亡).
*   **B: 所有房客皆來自阿拉伯聯合大公國** - The passage says the guests were *mainly* from the UAE (主要為阿拉伯聯合大公國人民), not *all* from there.
*   **D: 阿拉伯聯合大公國人民** - This is not a complete statement and doesn't reflect a fact *about* the event; it just identifies a group of people.



"
根據文章，有關碰撞，哪些並非不確定的資訊？,"The correct answer is **D: 殘骸位置**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""美國國防部戰略司令部正在追蹤殘骸."" (The US Strategic Command is tracking the debris.) This means the location of the debris *is* being tracked, and therefore is not uncertain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 碰撞的大小 (The size of the collision):** The passage says ""他們仍在試著判斷撞擊的規模"" (They are still trying to determine the scale of the impact) – clearly uncertain.
* **B: 碰撞的地點 (The location of the collision):** While we know the altitude (491 miles), the specific *location* isn't mentioned as known.
* **C: 碰撞對地球的影響 (The impact on Earth):** The passage says ""他們仍在試著判斷...對地球的影響"" (They are still trying to determine...the impact on Earth) – also uncertain.



"
根據文章，以下關於碰撞的哪些事情有待商榷？,"The correct answer is **D: 碰撞的確切規模 (the exact scale of the collision)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""They are still trying to determine the scale of the impact and its effects on Earth."" This indicates the scale of the collision is *uncertain* and under investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 誰來負責處理殘骸追蹤 (Who is responsible for tracking the debris)** - The passage states the US Department of Defense Strategic Command is tracking the debris, so this isn't uncertain.
*   **B: 碰撞時衛星的行進速度 (The speed of the satellites at the time of the collision)** - The passage states they were traveling at ""around 17,500 miles per hour,"" giving a specific speed.
*   **C: 如何共享繪圖分析結果 (How the chart analysis will be shared)** - The passage says the analysis will be published on a public website, indicating *how* it will be shared.



"
根據文章，巴汀曾在美國人富豪名單上排名第幾？,"The correct answer is **C: 第 190 名**.

The passage states: ""他在 2008 年美國前四百大富豪排行榜上名列第 190 位。"" (He ranked 190th on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2008.)
"
巴汀曾向以下哪個機構捐款？,"The correct answer is **B: 維吉尼亞大學 (University of Virginia)**.

The passage states: ""He generously funded the college."" and specifically mentions ""the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia."" This directly links Batten to donating to the University of Virginia.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 美國富豪排行榜 (Forbes 400 list)** - The passage mentions his ranking *on* the list, not donating *to* it.
*   **C: 大量機構 (Numerous institutions)** - While possible, the passage only specifically mentions the University of Virginia.
*   **D: 藝術和科學的專門學院 (Dedicated colleges of arts and sciences)** - While correct that he funded the arts and science college, the question is *where* he donated, and the answer is the University of Virginia."
阿諾·史瓦辛格州長簽署的法案中不包含哪一部份？,"The correct answer is **C: 禁止在加州以外的地方向未成年人出售或租借暴力電動遊戲 (Prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors outside of California)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states the law applies to sales *within* California.** It doesn't mention any restrictions on sales in other states.
* **A, B, and D are all directly mentioned in the passage:**
    * **A:** The law *does* effectively prohibit sales to minors.
    * **B:** A $1,000 fine is mentioned for violations.
    * **D:** The requirement for an ""18"" sticker is stated.

Therefore, option C is the only element *not* included in the described law.
"
根據文章，誰錯過了別人正在說的事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 米勒**.

Here's why:

The text states ""米勒被要求發表評論時，他表示：「麥克在聽證會上說了很多……我那時正在做準備，所以其實沒聽到他說了什麼。」"" 

This directly indicates that Miller missed what Mike was saying because he was preparing for something else.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 杜瓦爾的孩子們** - The text doesn't mention the children's listening habits.
*   **B: 麥克** - Mike *was* speaking, so he wasn't missing anything.
*   **D: 杜瓦爾** - The text doesn't say anything about Duval missing what Mike said."
根據文章，以下哪項米勒在聽證會上的經歷是正確的？,"The correct answer is **B: He was preparing something so he didn't pay attention.**

Here's why:

* The text directly states: ""I was preparing something at the time, so I didn't actually hear what he said."" This means Miller was occupied with preparation and didn't listen to Duval.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Duval left a strong impression on Miller** - The text says Duval did *not* impress Miller.
* **C: Duval's two children spoke a lot during the hearing** - The text doesn't mention Duval's children at all.
* **D: He listened attentively to Duval's story** - The text explicitly states he *didn't* hear what Duval said.



"
是誰建議對《空氣潔淨法》進行修訂？,"The correct answer is **C: 傑克·林頓 (Jack Layton)**.

The text states: ""雷頓在與總理的會面中，請求修改保守黨的環境法案，要求「全面徹底改寫」保守黨所提的環境法案。"" This directly translates to Layton requesting amendments to the Clean Air Act.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 約翰·霍華德 (John Howard)** - He's discussing hospital funding, not the Clean Air Act.
*   **B: 保守黨 (Conservative Party)** - The text states Layton wants *changes* to the Conservative's bill, not that the Conservatives themselves suggested revisions.
*   **D: 史蒂芬·哈珀 (Stephen Harper)** - Harper *agreed* to a review, but Layton was the one who requested the changes.



"
是誰駁斥《空氣潔淨法》被當作選舉前的噱頭？,"The correct answer is **B: 一位總理** (A Prime Minister).

Here's why:

The passage states that Prime Minister John Howard refuted the claim that funding for the Mercy Hospital (not the Clean Air Act) was a pre-election stunt. While the question asks about the *Clean Air Act*, the only person explicitly refuting something being a political gimmick is Prime Minister Howard. It's a bit of a trick question that tests understanding of who is responding to what claim within the text.
"
當三聚氰酸和三聚氰胺在貓尿中相互反應時，會形成什麼化合物？,"The correct answer is **C: 結晶 (Crystals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""兩種化合物會互相反應，產生阻礙腎功能的結晶"" (These two compounds react with each other to produce crystals that obstruct kidney function).  It then goes on to describe researchers observing the formation of these crystals when adding melamine and cyanuric acid to cat urine.  The FTIR analysis confirms these lab-created crystals *are the same* as those found in the affected pets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 腎臟 (Kidney):** While the crystals *affect* the kidneys, they are not the compound formed.
*   **B: 寵物食品 (Pet food):** The melamine and cyanuric acid were *in* the pet food, but the reaction happens in the urine.
*   **D: 紅外線光譜學 (Infrared spectroscopy):** This is a method used to *analyze* the crystals, not the crystals themselves.



"
研究人員使用紅外光譜觀察了什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 寵物尿液中的結晶成份**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""透過紅外光譜術 (FTIR) 進行比較時顯示，這些晶體的組成與受害寵物的尿液中發現的晶體相符。"" This directly indicates they used FTIR to examine the *composition of the crystals* found in the pet urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 腎臟功能:** While the passage mentions the compounds impede kidney function, the *FTIR was not used to observe kidney function itself*, but rather to analyze the crystals that cause the problem.
* **C: 受影響的寵物:** The research observed crystals, not the pets directly, with FTIR.
* **D: 受污染的寵物食品:**  The FTIR was used to analyze the crystals from the *urine*, not the food itself."
誰稱露娜為「極限女王」？,"The correct answer is **D: 湯米·卓門**.

The text states: ""湯米·卓門曾說：「露娜是第一位極限女王。」"" (Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first Extreme Queen."")

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who called Luna the ""Extreme Queen""."
誰指稱露娜很「怪異」？,"The correct answer is **B: 達斯汀·讓尼爾斯 (Dustin Runnels)**.

The text specifically states: “知名摔角手「金粉」達斯汀·讓尼爾斯 (Dustin Runnels) 評論說：「盧納和我一樣怪異…或許甚至比我還要怪異…」” 

Therefore, Dustin Runnels is the one who called Luna “weird”."
撞車事故中的司機沒有發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: He suffered head injuries.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""The driver sustained serious head injuries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He didn't injure anyone inside the house:** While true, the question asks *what happened to the driver*, not what he *didn't* do.
* **C: He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to one in Great Yarmouth:** The passage states the *opposite* – he was transferred *from* Great Yarmouth *to* Cambridge.
* **D: Paramedics rescued him from the car:** While true, this describes a *rescue action*, not what happened *to the driver* as a result of the accident.



"
在橄欖球賽期間，何者並非南非隊比賽突出的地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 在比賽開始時表現出色 (performing well at the start of the match)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Although they were a bit rusty compared to their southern sisters at the beginning of the match, South Africa steadily improved as the game went on."" This directly contradicts the idea that they performed well at the *start* of the match. They were rusty initially.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 令人印象深刻的團隊合作 (Impressive teamwork):** The passage states they excelled with ""excellent team coordination.""
* **B: 控球能力 (Ball control):** The passage specifically mentions ""ball control skills.""
* **D: 防守技巧 (Defensive skills):** The passage highlights their ""disciplined defense.""

Therefore, only option C is *not* a point of strength mentioned for the South African team in the passage.
"
根據文章，南非隊的比賽是什麼時候開始進步的？,"The correct answer is **D: 隨著比賽的進行** (As the game progressed).

Here's why:

The text states: ""雖然在比賽中與南方姊妹們相比確實生疏了些，但隨著比賽的進行，南非隊很穩定地在進步。"" This directly translates to ""Although they were initially unfamiliar compared to their southern sisters, South Africa steadily improved **as the game progressed**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 大約在上午 10:00 (Around 10:00 AM)** - This is when the game *started*, not when they started improving.
*   **B: 加強防守之後 (After strengthening their defense)** - The text mentions good defense *as a characteristic* of their improvement, but doesn't say improvement started *after* improving defense.
*   **C: 在輸給尚比亞隊之後 (After losing to Zambia)** - South Africa *won* against Zambia (26-0), so this is incorrect.



"
根據文章，哪一個陳述並未正確反映中國的經濟狀況？,"The correct answer is **D: 中國出口的汽車從未比德國多**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""去年中國汽車的出口量首次超越德國"" which translates to ""Last year, China's auto exports surpassed Germany for the first time."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: 自從改革以來，中國的經濟呈指數級增長 (Since the reforms, China's economy has grown exponentially)** - The passage says the economy grew 90 times in size, indicating exponential growth.
* **B: 中國擁有比美國更大的汽車出口市場 (China has a larger auto export market than the US)** - The passage states China surpassed the US as the largest market in the industry.
* **C: 中國最終可能會擁有比美國更高的 GDP (China may eventually have a higher GDP than the US)** - The passage says China's GDP could surpass the US within 20 years.



"
根據文章，中國的國民生產毛額 (GDP) 何時可能會超過美國？,"The correct answer is **B: 在二十年內 (In twenty years)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""中國的 GDP 在 20 年之內就可能超過美國"" (China's GDP could surpass the United States within 20 years).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在更多的經濟改革後 (After more economic reforms)** - While reforms are the *reason* for the growth, the passage doesn't say GDP will surpass the US *after* more reforms, but *within* 20 years.
*   **C: 當國家由新領袖帶領時 (When the country is led by a new leader)** - The passage mentions Deng Xiaoping, but doesn't link GDP surpassing the US to a change in leadership.
*   **D: 在三十年內 (In thirty years)** - The passage specifically states *20* years, not 30."
胡錦濤建議發展中國家做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 避免污染的老路 (Avoid the old path of polluting first, then cleaning up later)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states, ""胡錦濤鼓勵發展中的國家‘避免先汙染、後清理的老路’"" (Hu Jintao encouraged developing countries to 'avoid the old path of polluting first, then cleaning up later').

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 承擔推動其發展階段的義務 (Undertake obligations to advance their stage of development)** - While Hu Jintao acknowledges their development stages, he doesn't suggest they *undertake obligations* related to it, but rather avoid repeating past mistakes.
*   **B: 注重經濟產出 (Focus on economic output)** - He links emissions reduction *to* economic output but doesn't suggest focusing *on* economic output.
*   **C: 承擔超出他們目前的責任 (Undertake responsibilities beyond their current capacity)** - He specifically argues *against* requiring them to do this.



"
胡錦濤沒提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 碳減排量的數字**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""He did not set a quantity for the reduction, only stating that it would be based on China’s economic output."" This means he didn't mention *how much* China would reduce emissions by.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 削減的基礎 (Reduction baseline)** - The passage states the reduction will be based on 2005 levels.
* **B: 對發展中國家在污染方面的建議 (Advice to developing countries on pollution)** - He *did* mention encouraging them to ""avoid the old road of polluting first, cleaning up later.""
* **C: 希望減少碳排放的日期 (Date for wanting to reduce carbon emissions)** - He mentioned ""before 2020.""



"
費爾曼說以下何者的情況不好？,"The correct answer is **B: 安哥拉 (Angola)**.

The passage states ""費爾曼表示：「安哥拉正面臨它們有史以來最嚴重的疫情，且安哥拉的情況仍然非常糟。」"" which translates to ""Fairman stated, 'Angola is facing its worst outbreak ever, and the situation in Angola remains very bad.'""

Therefore, Fairman is saying the situation in **Angola** is bad.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 無國界醫生 (Doctors Without Borders)** - Fairman *works for* Doctors Without Borders, but he's commenting on Angola, not the organization itself.
*   **C: 曼戈拉 (Mangola)** - The passage only mentions Mangola as one of the organizations stating the outbreak's severity, not its condition.
*   **D: 世界衛生組織 (World Health Organization)** - Similar to Mangola, the WHO is simply acknowledging the severity, not experiencing it.



"
由於起訴，誰將接任休恩的內閣職位？,"The correct answer is **A: 戴維**. 

The passage states: ""休恩已辭職，他在內閣的職位將由愛德·戴維議員接任。"" (Heuen has resigned, and his cabinet position will be taken over by Councilor Ed Davies.)"
在起訴後，誰將出任商務大臣？,"The correct answer is **A: 蘭姆 (Lamb)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""諾曼·蘭姆議員有望接替戴維，出任商務大臣一職"" which translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is expected to replace David, taking on the role of Secretary of State for Business"".

Therefore, after the prosecutions, Norman Lamb is expected to be the Secretary of State for Business.



"
表演者在卡米爾·聖桑的歌劇中鼓勵觀眾做什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 參與使用大麻 (Participate in using marijuana)**.

The passage explicitly states that the theater encourages audience members to smoke along with the performers. This directly links to marijuana use.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 去日本旅行 (Travel to Japan)** - While the artist is said to have a love for Japan, the passage doesn't suggest encouraging the audience to travel there.
*   **C: 和他們一起上台表演 (Join them on stage to perform)** - The text doesn't mention anything about inviting the audience to perform.
*   **D: 讓他們的生活由他們所愛的東西來決定 (Let their lives be governed by what they love)** - This is a theme of the *artist's* life, not something the performance encourages the audience to do.



"
誰主要在歌劇中抽大麻捲菸？,"The correct answer is **C: 表演者 (Performers)**.

The passage specifically states ""表演者在舞台上抽大麻捲菸 (performers smoke marijuana cigarettes on stage)"". 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 藝術家 (The artist):** While the artist's life *inspires* the smoking, the passage says it's the *performers* doing it.
* **B: 法國觀眾 (French audience):** The passage says the theater *encourages* the audience to join, but doesn't say they are the ones initiating the smoking on stage.
* **D: 卡米爾·聖桑 (Camille Saint-Saens):** He *wrote* the opera, he isn't a character within it smoking.



"
雷歐諾夫執行的「太空漫步」的另一個名稱是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 艙外活動**.

The text explicitly states that ""太空漫步"" is another name for ""太空載具外活動 (EVA)"", which translates to ""艙外活動"" in Chinese. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 阿波羅-聯盟任務** - This was a mission he *led* 10 years later, not a name for his spacewalk.
*   **B: 太空競賽** - This is the broader context of the time, not a name for the spacewalk itself.
*   **D: 11 號太空人** - This is his nickname, not a name for his spacewalk."
雷歐諾夫帶領蘇聯執行了哪項任務？,"The correct answer is **B: 阿波羅-聯盟 (Apollo-Soyuz)**.

The passage states: ""10 年後，他帶領阿波羅-聯盟測試計劃中的蘇聯部份，象徵了太空競賽的結束。"" (10 years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, symbolizing the end of the space race.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 太空競賽 (Space Race):** While his work *ended* the space race, he didn't *lead* the space race itself.
*   **C: 11 號太空人 (11号太空人):** This is a nickname, not a mission he led.
*   **D: 艙外活動 (EVA/Spacewalk):** He *performed* the first spacewalk, but didn't lead a mission *called* ""舱外活动""."
誰在車禍中受傷？,"The correct answer is **A: 吉布森 (Gibson)**.

The text states: ""吉布森被送往醫院，但不久後便身亡 (Gibson was sent to the hospital, but died shortly after)."" This directly indicates Gibson was injured and ultimately succumbed to those injuries.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 車庫工人 (Garage worker):** The text states they were *observing* the scene, not injured.
*   **C: 孩子們 (Children):** They were frightened and crying, but not reported as injured.
*   **D: 卡車司機 (Truck driver):** The text explicitly states the truck driver was *not* injured."
捲入事故中的人們發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **B: 一個沒受傷，一個死了**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""64 歲的卡車司機沒有在車禍中受傷"" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the accident) and ""吉布森被送往醫院，但不久後便身亡"" (Gibson was taken to the hospital, but died shortly after).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他們都死了** (They all died) - We only know Gibson died.
* **C: 他們尖叫和哭泣** (They screamed and cried) - This describes the *children* who witnessed the accident, not the people *involved* in the accident.
* **D: 兩人都受了傷** (Both were injured) - We know the truck driver was *not* injured.



"
為該計劃工作的科學家希望觀察以下何者造成的影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 潮汐引力 (Tidal Gravity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""該團隊想觀察到的效應，是由此星系與銀河各自之暗物質交互影響潮汐的結果"" (The team wants to observe the effect resulting from the tidal interaction of dark matter between this galaxy and the Milky Way).  It directly links the observation to a tidal effect.
* **The analogy to the moon and Earth** further reinforces that the focus is on *tidal forces*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 固定事件 (Fixed Events)** - The passage doesn't mention specific, fixed events they are looking for.
* **C: 小粒子 (Small Particles)** - While the theory mentions dark matter being *composed* of particles, the research isn't directly focused on observing those particles themselves, but the overall effect they create.
* **D: 暗物質 (Dark Matter)** - They're not trying to observe dark matter itself, but the *effect* of its interaction – the tidal forces it generates.



"
科學家正在觀察下列哪些事物？,"The correct answer is **D: 人馬座星系和銀河 (Andromeda and the Milky Way)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""The team wants to observe the effects resulting from the interaction between Andromeda and the Milky Way's dark matter.""
* The analogy to the moon and Earth is used to *explain* the type of interaction (tidal forces), but the actual observation is focused on the two galaxies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 銀河和月球 (Milky Way and the Moon):** The moon is only used as an analogy.
* **B: 地球和人馬座星系 (Earth and Andromeda):**  Earth isn't the focus of the observations.
* **C: 地球和月球 (Earth and the Moon):**  Again, this is only an analogy to help understand the concept.



"
根據文章，保守派不會批評以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 救濟支出 (Relief spending)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states conservatives ""jokingly referred to it as 'Bush's New Orleans Deal'.""** This implies their criticism was focused on *how* the money was spent (favoritism, contracts to insiders), not the act of spending relief funds *at all*. They were making a point about corruption or mismanagement, not arguing against helping New Orleans.
* **The passage explicitly states liberals criticized who received the reconstruction contracts.** This means it wasn't a conservative criticism.
* **The ""New Orleans Deal"" nickname also points to conservatives being concerned with the awarding of reconstruction contracts.**
* **Reconstruction spending is tied directly to the contracts, and thus a point of contention for conservatives.**

Therefore, the only option conservatives *wouldn't* criticize, according to the passage, is the relief spending itself."
誰在批評卡崔娜颶風救援工作的重建合約？,"The correct answer is **B: 自由派**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""自由派對推動重建的批評，主要在於重建合約犒賞了一般認為的華府圈內人。"" This directly indicates that liberals were criticizing the reconstruction contracts after Hurricane Katrina.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 財政保守派:** While they *named* the situation with a sarcastic nickname (""布希的紐奧良交易""), they weren't the ones directly criticizing the contracts themselves – they were commenting on the overall spending.
*   **C: 布希:** The passage doesn't say Bush was criticized, but rather that the situation was jokingly called ""Bush's New Orleans deal.""
*   **D: 華府圈內人:** These were the *recipients* of the criticized contracts, not the critics themselves.



"
根據文章，星塵號太空船發出的光首先會在哪裡看到？,"The correct answer is **B: 北加州 (North California)**.

The passage states: ""It will fly over the West Coast of Northern California, illuminating skies from California to central Oregon, then across Nevada and into Utah."" This means the light will *first* be seen over North California.
"
根據文章，該太空船將創下以下哪一項紀錄？,"The correct answer is **C: 最快返回地球 (Fastest return to Earth)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""StarDust will be the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth and in doing so will break a record set in May 1969 by the Apollo 10 command module.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 照亮最寬闊的天空 (Illuminating the widest sky):** While it *will* illuminate a large area, the passage doesn't state it's the *widest* ever.
*   **B: 最多城市可看到它 (Most cities able to see it):** The passage lists regions, not specific cities, and doesn't claim it will be visible from the most cities.
*   **D: 最快從舊金山抵達洛杉磯 (Fastest travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles):**  The passage *uses* the San Francisco to Los Angeles comparison to illustrate the speed, but it's not the record the spacecraft is breaking."
馬拉·巴拉蘇布拉曼尼安醫生是薩羅雅·巴拉蘇布拉馬尼安的誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 女兒**.

The text states: ""They found the body of Sarojah Balasubramanian, 53, covered with a blood-stained blanket."" and then mentions ""Malar Balasubramanian, 29, ..."". This clearly indicates Malar is the daughter of Sarojah.
"
薩羅雅·巴拉蘇布拉馬尼安的屍體在哪裡被發現？,"The correct answer is **C: 汽車後車箱**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""They found the body of Saroya Balasubramanian, 53, covered with a blood-stained blanket **in a black Oldsmobile Intrigue car**."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在辛辛那提** - While the location is *near* Cincinnati, the body wasn't just *in* Cincinnati. It was specifically in a car.
*   **B: 路邊** - The doctor was found by the roadside, but the *body* was in the car.
*   **D: 匹茲堡** - The doctor worked in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio.



"
eBay 收購了什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage explicitly states that eBay made a large acquisition of Skype to diversify profits and expand its presence in areas where Skype is strong. 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Microsoft** - Microsoft *acquired* Skype, not the other way around.
*   **B: Apple** - There's no mention of Apple in the passage.
*   **D: Zoom** - Zoom wasn't a significant player in the market at the time of this eBay acquisition."
eBay 希望透過此次收購實現什麼目標？,"The correct answer is **B: 擴展到新的領域 (Expand into new areas)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states eBay wants to **increase its presence in regions where Skype is strong** (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil). This indicates a desire to expand into new geographical markets.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 鞏固其收入 (Solidify its income):** While diversifying income *is* a goal, the passage says they want to *diversify* income sources, not just solidify existing ones.
* **C: 提高知名度 (Increase awareness):** This is a *result* of expanding into new areas, but not the primary goal itself.
* **D: 讓股東滿意 (Satisfy shareholders):**  This is a general business goal, but the passage doesn't mention anything specific about shareholder satisfaction as the reason for the acquisition.



"
根據文章，誰沒有與留在現場的囚犯互動？,"The correct answer is **D: 醫院工作人員**.

Here's why:

*   **談判者 (Negotiators):** The text specifically states they *attempted* to correct the situation and interact with the prisoners.
*   **消防救援人員 (Fire Department):** They arrived to put out the fire in the courtyard, directly interacting with the aftermath of the prisoners' actions.
*   **警察 (Police):** The text states ""fully armed riot police...forced the inmates into corners"" – a clear interaction.
*   **醫院工作人員 (Hospital staff):** The text only mentions them *receiving* the injured. There's no indication they interacted with the prisoners who remained in the courtyard.

Therefore, hospital staff are the only group listed that did *not* directly interact with the prisoners in the courtyard."
以下哪一項最終讓囚犯們停止暴動？,"The correct answer is **B: 催淚瓦斯**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""全副武裝的鎮暴警察很快就進入院子，並利用催淚瓦斯把犯人逼到死角."" This directly led to the end of the standoff. The fire was extinguished *after* the police used tear gas, and the wounded prisoners and negotiations didn't end the riot.
"
在阿亞圖拉賽義德阿里·哈米尼的觀點中，伊朗應該從什麼之中解放？,"The correct answer is **D: 對石油的依賴 (dependence on oil)**.

The passage specifically states: ""該國最高領袖大阿亞圖拉賽義德阿里·哈米尼曾形容，對石油的依賴是一個早在 1979 年伊朗伊斯蘭革命之前就出現的「陷阱」，而伊朗應該從中解放出來."" (The country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei described dependence on oil as a 'trap' that existed even before the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, and that Iran should liberate itself from it.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 金融限制 (financial restrictions)** - While the passage mentions financial restrictions, it doesn't say Khamenei wants Iran to liberate itself *from them*.
*   **B: 伊斯蘭革命 (Islamic Revolution)** - Khamenei sees the reliance on oil as predating the revolution, not as something to be liberated from.
*   **C: 國外收益 (foreign earnings)** - These are affected by the situation, but not what Khamenei specifically identifies as the problem."
根據文章，誰承認了制裁對伊朗經濟的影響？,"The correct answer is **A: 高層消息來源**.

The passage explicitly states: ""在電視上直播的評論中，伊朗高層消息來源首次承認制裁有產生影響."" (In a televised commentary, a high-ranking Iranian source for the first time admitted that sanctions were having an effect.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 石油輸出國組織 (OPEC)** - OPEC reported on low oil exports, but didn't *admit* sanctions were the cause. They simply stated a fact.
* **C: 阿亞圖拉賽義德阿里·哈米尼 (Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei)** - He criticized reliance on oil, but didn't admit the sanctions were impacting the economy.
* **D: 歐盟 (EU)** - The EU *imposed* the sanctions, they didn't *admit* their effect.



"
以下哪項不是法國投票程序的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 由候選人代表進行計票 (Candidates' representatives performing the count)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *volunteers* count the ballots under strict supervision and following specific procedures. It doesn't say candidates' representatives do the counting themselves, only that they can *witness* all parts of the process, including the count.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, according to the passage:

*   **A: 透明投票箱 (Transparent ballot boxes)** - The passage specifically states that ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988.
*   **B: 由候選人派出的代表 (Representatives dispatched by candidates)** - The passage states candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process.
*   **C: 簽署投票單 (Signing the voting slip)** - The passage mentions voters sign the voting slip.

"
選民在哪裡指明他們選擇的候選人？,"The correct answer is **B: 在事先印妥的紙上** (On the pre-printed ballot).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""投票者獨自在投票亭內，將**事先印妥表明投票對象的選票**放入信封中。"" This directly translates to ""Voters, alone in the booth, place a **pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate** into an envelope.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 在投票單上** (On the voting slip) - The voting slip is used for signing, not marking a choice.
*   **C: 在信封上** (On the envelope) - The envelope is just for secrecy, the choice is made *before* placing the ballot in the envelope.
*   **D: 在投票亭內的機器上** (On a machine inside the voting booth) - The passage describes a traditional, low-tech process with paper ballots, not machines."
是什麼促使艾倫開始為期八年的武藏號搜尋？,"The correct answer is **D: 他對戰爭的興趣 (His interest in war)**.

The passage explicitly states that Paul Allen ""began searching for the Musashi out of a lifelong fascination with the war."" While his wealth (A) and investment in ocean exploration (C) *enabled* the search, and seabed mapping (B) was a step in the process, it was his fascination with war that *motivated* him to start the search in the first place.
"
根據文章，艾倫將他的大部分財產用於何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 海洋探險 (Ocean exploration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""據報導，身為世界上最富有的人之一，艾倫已將大部分財產投入於海洋探勘中..."" This directly translates to ""Reportedly, as one of the wealthiest people in the world, Allen has invested the majority of his wealth in ocean exploration...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 恢復武藏號 (Recovering the Musashi):** While finding the Musashi was *a result* of his investment, it wasn't the investment itself.
*   **C: 建造水下探測載具 (Building underwater probes):** ROVs were *used* in the exploration, but the investment was broader than just building them.
*   **D: 學習海床繪圖製作 (Learning seafloor mapping):** Seafloor mapping was a *step* in the process, not the primary focus of the financial investment."
根據文章，以下何者可能導致工廠內部和周圍出現危險情況？,"The correct answer is **A: 鈾燃料 (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""現場裝有鈾燃料的容器可能已經破裂並正在洩漏"" (The container with uranium fuel on site may have broken and is leaking). This directly links the uranium fuel to the potential danger.
* **While the other options are mentioned, they are *results* of the potential uranium leak, not the *cause*:**
    * **放射性銫 (Radioactive cesium) and 碘 (Iodine)** were *found*, indicating a problem, but aren't the source.
    * **白色煙霧 (White smoke)** is a *symptom* of something happening, but not the root cause.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the danger is the potential breach of the uranium fuel containers.
"
