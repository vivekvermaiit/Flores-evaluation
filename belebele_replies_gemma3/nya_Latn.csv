Ndi maperesenti angati a anthu amene anafufuza za chithandizo cha dziko la Ositileliya kukhala chapompopompo?,"The correct answer is **B: Maperesenti 29**.

The text states: ""Pofika pachimake pachisankho, 29% ya omwe adafunsidwa amakhulupirira kuti Australia iyenera kukhala republic posachedwa..."" This directly answers the question of what percentage of people surveyed supported Australia becoming a republic.
"
"Malingana ndi a Julie Gillard, kodi dziko la Ositilaliya limayenera kukhala dziko loyima palokha liti?","The correct answer is **B: Utantha ulamuliro wa ufumu wai Mfumukazi Elizabeth yachiwiri**.

The text states: ""Nduna yaikulu yogwirizila a Julia Gillard anati pa nthawi yokopa anthu pa chisankho cha 2020 anakhulupilira kuti Australia aime payekha pakutha pa ulamuliro wa mfumukazi Elizabeth wachiwiri."" This directly translates to Julia Gillard believing Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign."
Ndi bungwe liti lomwe likufufuzidwa posatsatila malamulo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ubereki wokonzekera (Planned Parenthood)**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Ndondomeko ya a Komeni idaletsa Planned Parenthood chifukwa panali kafukufuku amene amafufuza mmene a Planned Parenthood amagwiritsa ntchito ndikupanga report ya ndalama imene a Representative Cliff Stearns amapanga."" This clearly indicates Planned Parenthood is the organization being investigated regarding potential legal issues and misuse of funds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Komiti ya nyumba ya mphamvuya magetsi ndi malonda (House Energy and Commerce Committee):** This committee is *conducting* the investigation, not being investigated itself.
*   **B: Bungwe la Komen Foundation (Komen Foundation):** The Komen Foundation is the one *changing its policies* based on the investigation, not the subject of the investigation.
*   **D: Komiti yaiying'ono yazoyang'anila ndi kufufuza (Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee):** This subcommittee is also *conducting* the investigation, not being investigated.



"
Cliff Stearns ndi mtsogoleri wakomiti iti?,"The correct answer is **D: Komiti yaiying'ono yazoyang'anila ndi kufufuza**.

The text specifically states: ""A Stearns omwe ndi wapampando wa Komiti yaying'ono ya Oversight and Investigation, lomwe lili pansi pa Komiti ya House Energy ndi Commerce..."" This translates to ""Mr. Stearns, who is the chairman of the Oversight and Investigation subcommittee, which falls under the House Energy and Commerce Committee...""



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chomwe sichinamuchitikire m’zimayi wachi Swiss?","Yowonetsa yoyenera ndiyo **B: Mzimayiyo anaphedwa**.

Ndimeyi ikunena kuti mzimayi wachi Swiss anagwiriridwa m'manja mwa anthu asanu komanso kuti zinthu zake zinabedwa, koma sichilankhula za kuphwanya chilichonse mchimayi wachi Swiss."
Ndi kampani iti imene inapatsidwa chinkho cha Taiwan posaononga zachilengedwe itawina mpikisano mu chaka cha 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text explicitly states: ""ASUS idapatsidwa mphoto ya 2007 Taiwan sustainable Award..."" which translates to ""ASUS was awarded the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award..."". 

Therefore, ASUS is the company that won the award."
Kodi ASUS Eee ndi kompyuta yanji?,"The correct answer is **C: Kompyuta yam'manja**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ASUS Eee PC... ili ndizambiri zopangitsa magwiridwe antchito..."" (ASUS Eee PC... is a type of device that facilitates work...) and mentions it being discussed at a computer show.  This indicates it's a computing device.
* **The passage also refers to it as a ""laptop""** (though it's described as a very affordable one). A ""kompyuta yam'manja"" translates to ""handheld computer"" which is a general description encompassing smaller laptops and netbooks like the Eee PC.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Foni yam'manja (Mobile phone):** The text doesn't mention phone capabilities.
    * **B: Laputopu (Laptop):** While it is a type of laptop, ""kompyuta yam'manja"" is a more accurate general description considering its size and early positioning.
    * **D: Pager:** Pagers are outdated and don't have the computing functionality described.



"
Anosowetsa zikalata za positi ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **C: Mnyamata** (A young man).

The text explicitly states: ""…a young man hid more than 600 letters including 429 New Year’s cards..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ogwira ntchito ku positi ofesi** (Post office workers) - The text doesn't say the workers were hiding the letters, it says a young man did.
*   **B: Gulu la anthu okhala ku Obanazawa** (Group of people living in Obanazawa) - The text doesn't implicate a group of people.
*   **D: Wofalitsa nkhani** (Reporter) - The reporter just *reported* on the event; they didn't hide the letters."
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndi ndani amene anapepesa pankhani yokhudza kusowa kwa zikalata?","The correct answer is **C: Wofalitsa nkhani** (The shipping company and spokesperson).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dzulo, kampani ya zamtengatenga ndi mtokoma idapepesa kwa anthu komaso kwa atolankhani..."" which translates to ""Yesterday, the shipping company and spokesperson announced to the people and also to the press...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anthu okhala m'derali** (Local residents) - They complained about the missing cards, they didn't announce anything.
*   **B: Mnyamata** (The young man) - He hid the letters, he wasn't the one making an announcement.
*   **D: A positi ofesi yapa Obanazawa** (Obanazawa Post Office) - They were the recipients of the complaints, not the announcers.



"
Kodi a Del Potro adafunika atafotokoza za vuto lawo la phewa liti?,"The correct answer is **B: Masewero oyamba opeza opambana asanachitike**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Del Potro kumayambiliro agawo lachiwiri adali ndi mwayi, koma zimenezi zinafunabe kupeza wopambana chifukwa adafanana 6-6. Nthawi imeneyi a Potro adalandira thandizo paphewa pawo koma adakwanitsa kupitiliza masewerowo.""

This means Del Potro received medical attention for his wrist *before* the tiebreak (the situation to determine the winner after 6-6) in the first set. ""Kumayambiliro agawo lachiwiri"" refers to the start of what would determine the winner of the first set (the tiebreak). Thus, the problem was addressed before the decisive games to win the set were played.



"
Kodi zotsatila za masewera oyamba opeza owira zidali chani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuluza kwa a Murray mu nthawi ya masewero oyamba**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Murray adalephera gawo loyamba..."" which translates to ""Murray lost the first set..."" This directly answers the question about the result of the first set.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuluza kwa a Del Potro kutsatila kuvulala kwake** - The passage doesn't mention Del Potro losing *because* of an injury, it only mentions he received support on his knee and continued playing.
*   **C: Anapambana ndi a Murray mu nthawi ya masewero achiwiri** - The passage says the second set was tied 6-6, so there was no winner in the second set yet.
*   **D: Anapambana ndi a Del Potro mu nthawi ya masewero achiwiri** -  Same as above, the second set was tied.



"
"Monga afotokozera mundimeyi, ndi ndani, amene anakhudzana ndi odwala?","The correct answer is **B: Ana**.

The passage states: “Lero tamva ana amsinkhu wopita ku sukulu ena apezeka kuti adakomana ndi amene adali kudwala.” This directly indicates that children (ana) were the ones who had contact with those who were sick.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chitsimikizo chiti chomwe bwanankubwa sanapeleke nthawi imene amalankhula nzika za ku Texas?","The correct answer is **A: Kugwira bwino ntchito kwa ndondomeko** (Effectiveness of the system).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tikakhale ndichikhulupiliro kuti makina athu akugwira bwino ntchito m'mene ayenera kugwilira."" (Let's hope our systems are working as they should). This expresses *hope* about the system's functionality, but doesn't *confirm* it. He's expressing a desire for it to be effective, not stating it *is* effective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zithu zimachitika ndi cholinga choteteza chitetezo chagulu** (Things are being done with the goal of protecting public safety) – Perry *does* assure citizens that measures are being taken to keep them safe.
* **C: Ali ndi zida zothanilana ndi zovuta zomwe angakumane nazo** (They have the tools to deal with the challenges they face) – He implies readiness by talking about ""places that are well-equipped,"" but doesn't explicitly mention tools.
* **D: Mlandu siwovuta kwambiri** (The situation isn’t too bad) - He says it is ""very concerning"" (""Izi ndizowopsa kwambiri"") meaning he doesn't believe the situation is minor.



"
Ndi gwero lanji lofalitsira nkhani pa intaneti lomwe linapangidwa ndi ophunzira aku UW,"The correct answer is **D: Anyezi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuyambira pa chiyambi pake, The Onion yakhala nkhani zabwino zosililika..."". It goes on to describe The Onion's online presence and its origins with students at UW in 1988. Therefore, ""The Onion"" (translated as ""Anyezi"" in Chichewa) is the online news source created by UW students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lipoti la Colbert** (Colbert Report): The passage states the Onion's writers *contributed* to the Colbert Report, it wasn't created by the UW students.
*   **B: Zisankho zakukoleji** (College elections): While the passage mentions a 2000 election, it’s a reference to a satirical Onion article, not the source itself.
*   **C: Zionetsero za tsiku ndi tsiku** (Daily shows):  Similar to Colbert Report, the passage notes the Onion writers worked on ""Daily Show"", but the Onion wasn’t a daily show itself.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndi ziti mwa izi zomwe sizinaikidwe mutsamba lofalitsila nkhani pa intaneti mu ufumu wa a Onions?","Yankho loyenera ndi **B: Kanema**.

*   Tsamba la pa intaneti (lomwe anthu 5,000,000 adafika mu Okutobala)
*   Uthenga wamalonda waumwini

Kanema sichinatchulidwe monga chinthu chomwe chinaperekedwa pa tsamba la pa intaneti la The Onion."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani chomwe amalondela apolisi?","The correct answer is **A: Trafalgar Square**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cha m'ma 11:29, chiwonetserochi chinapita ku Whitehall, **kudutsa Trafalgar Square**, kudutsa Strand, kudutsa Aldwych ndikukwera Kingsway..."" 

This directly shows that Trafalgar Square is what the protesters passed after the police asked them to move.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Msonkhano wa Spring** - The text mentions a Conservative party conference, not a Spring conference.
*   **C: Njira yolowera pansi pa nsewu** - The text doesn't mention an underground passage.
*   **D: Zipinda zogonamo alendo zazikulu kwambiri za Connaught** - The protesters went *to* the Grand Connaught Hotel, but didn't pass *through* the rooms.



"
Ndi nthawi yanji imene apolisi anawafunsa anthu azionetsero kuti asuthe ndi cholinga chopewa kuchedwetsa magalimoto,"The correct answer is **D: Pa 11:20**.

The text states: ""Pamene nthawi idali 11:20, apolisi adafunsa anthu kuti abwerele ku njira, kunena kuti akuyenera ku linganiza ufulu wawo wotsutsa ndi kuyamba kwa unyinji wa magalimoto."" This directly translates to ""At 11:20, police asked protesters to move, stating they needed to balance their right to protest with the flow of public traffic."""
Choona ndi chani pa zakafukufuku yemwe anapangidwa ndi a dokotala. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Mbewa zina zomwe zinali ndi nthenda ya shuga sizikudwalanso nthendayi**.

Here's why:

The text states: “Pano tili ndi mbewa ndi miyezi inayi zomwe zilibe matenda a shuga omwe zinkadwala” which translates to ""Now we have mice for four months that do not have diabetes that they were sick with."" This directly indicates that some mice previously afflicted with diabetes are no longer suffering from the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zotsatila zikhoza kuthandiza odwala amene ali ndi mtundu woyamba wa matenda a shuga** - The text explicitly states that other experts doubt whether the results will benefit people *already* with type 1 diabetes.
*   **C: Ali ndi chiyembekezo kuti zotsatilazi zikhoza kubweretsa mankhwala ochiza** - While Dr. Ur is optimistic, the text also states the research is in its early stages.
*   **D: Mbewa zina zoti zinalibe nthenda ya shuga pano zikudwala nthendayi** - The text does not mention any mice developing diabetes who didn't previously have it.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chomwe a dokotala. Ur akukaikira?","The correct answer is **B: Ngati kuchiza kuli kotheka**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""amakhulupirira ngati matenda a shuga angachiritsidwe, poona kuti zotsatila izi zilibe phindu kwa anthu ali kale ndi mtundu woyamba wa matenda ashuga."" This directly shows Dr. Ur questioning whether a cure for diabetes is even possible, given the initial findings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngati zotsatilazo ndizopindulira anthu omwe ali ndi ntundu woyamba wa matenda ashuga** - While the passage mentions the results having no benefit for those *with* type 1 diabetes, Dr. Ur's primary concern is about the possibility of a cure itself.
*   **C: Maganizo a akatswiri ena pazakuchizaku** - He *is* one of those experts questioning the cure. The passage focuses on *his* doubt.
*   **D: Ngati Mbewa yopanda matenda ashuga ipitilire kukhala choncho** - The passage doesn't mention doubt about the mice remaining disease-free; it's about whether this translates to a human cure.

Ndi mawu ati mwa otsatilawa omwe akufotokoza mosalondola kugwa kwa ndege ya CG4684?,"Yankho loyenera ndi **C: Ndege inayesera kutera maulendo okwana atatu isanagwe.**

Onani zifukwa zomwe zilibe chifukwa:

*   **A: Ndege inakanika kutera chifukwa cha nyengo yoipa** – Zolemba zikunena kuti nyengo yoyipa idasokoneza kufufuza, koma sichinachititse kuti ndegeyo igwe.
*   **B: Ndegeyo inagwa kudera lakumudzi** – Zolemba zikunena kuti malo omwe ndegeyo idagwako ali ""osafikika"" osati kudera lakumudzi.
*   **D: Kufufuza kwa ndege yokugwayo kunakhudzidwa ndi nyengo** – Zolemba zikunena molondola za izi."
Chinapangisa ndege ya CG4684 kuti isatele ndi chani?,"The correct answer is **D: Kunali nyengo yoyipa**.

The passage states: ""Kusaka kunasokonekera ndi nyengo yoyipa imene inapangitsa kuti ndege isatere."" (The search was hampered by bad weather which caused the plane not to land.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bwalo lotelerapo lina losafikilika** - While the crash site *is* inaccessible, this isn't why the plane failed to land initially.
*   **B: Patsogolo pa ndege ya CG4684 panalinso ndege zina** - The passage doesn't mention any other planes.
*   **C: Ndege anaipatsa njira ina yopita ku Kakoda** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the plane being given a different route.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndi mawu ati mwa otsatilawa omwe akukamba zoona za zimene zinamuchitikira Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **A: Anakwanitsa kuswa zenera**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""“Chimodzi mwadzotsekera chidatsekuka ndipo adayamba kutuluka”, adatero m'modzi mwa wopulumuka a Franciszek Kowal."" This translates to ""One of the windows broke open and he started to escape,"" said one of the survivors, Franciszek Kowal. This directly confirms he *was able* to break a window and get out.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pamapeto pake sanavulale** - The passage doesn't say anything about whether Franciszek Kowal was injured.
*   **C: Anatchola mpando akuyesera kuthawa** - The passage mentions people *using* chairs to try to break windows, but doesn't specify that Franciszek Kowal himself was doing that.
*   **D: Avulala pamene mayeselera kuswa zenera** - The passage doesn't mention any injuries to Franciszek Kowal.



"
Ndichifukwa chani ndizovuta ku tsimikizira zotsatira za mphepo yakuntho yotchedwa Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Mphepo yakunthoyi ili kutali ndi chivomelezi** (The hurricane is far from land).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pamene mphepo yamkuntho ili kutali ndi malo okugwa, zimakhalabe zovuta kuyesa kuthekera m'mene zingakhuzire ku United States kapena ku Caribbean."" This directly explains that the distance from land makes it difficult to predict the hurricane's impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mphepo yankunthoyi imalosera mphavu yolimbitsa chimvumbi.** (The hurricane is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane.) - While true, this doesn't explain *why* it's difficult to predict its impact.
*   **B: Akatswiri a za sayansi sakumvetsabe zakukhazikika kwa mphepo yamkuntho** (Science experts do not yet understand the stability of the hurricane) - The text doesn't suggest a lack of understanding, only that predicting is difficult due to distance.
*   **D: Mphepo ili kutali ndi dera la Miam** (The hurricane is far from the Miami area) - While true, the text states it's 3,000 miles from Miami, but the problem isn't just distance from Miami, it's distance from *any* land.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mawu ati mwaotsatilawa omwe sioona okhudza mphepo yamkutho yotchedwa Danielle?","The correct answer is **D: Inakakhala chivomelezi** (It turned into a tornado).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states Danielle is a hurricane**, not a tornado. It specifically mentions ""mphepo yamphamvu"" (strong winds) associated with hurricanes, and references the National Hurricane Center.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Zotsaira zake ku Caribbean sizikudziwika** (Its trajectory to the Caribbean is unknown) - The passage says it's ""difficult to predict how it might affect... the Caribbean.""
*   **B: Inapangidwa mnyanja ya Atlantic** (It was formed in the Atlantic Ocean) - The first sentence clearly states Danielle began ""kum'mawa kwa nyanja ya mchere ya Atlantic"" (east of the Atlantic Ocean).
*   **C: Inakatha kusanduka chimvumbi** (It could turn into a dust storm) - While the passage doesn’t mention a dust storm specifically, it does say the hurricane ""alimbikitsa mphepo yamkuntho"" (will intensify into a hurricane). A hurricane is a severe weather event, so it’s reasonable to infer that it *could* escalate further.

Therefore, only option D is factually incorrect based on the information in the provided text."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chikusonyeza kuti chichitika ndi matenda asanadzetse m'mliri padziko lonse?","The correct answer is **A: chikuyenera kukhala ndi mphavu yochepa yakupha**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Kafukufuku wina akuwonetsa kuti matendawa akuyenera kukhala osawopsa zisanafike muyezo oti mkukhala chiopsezo choyambitsa mliri wapadziko lonse."" This directly translates to ""One study shows that the disease must be mild before reaching a level that poses a risk of causing a global pandemic.""  ""Mild"" implies a low mortality rate (mphavu yochepa yakupha).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zizindikiro zake zikuyenera kukhala zomverera** - The passage actually states the opposite - the concern is that people might *continue* spreading the disease *while* having mild or few symptoms.
* **C: Anthu ambiri akuyenera kutenga kachirombo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about people becoming immune.
* **D: Ana akuyenera kudwala zizindikiro** - The passage specifically states the children *are* infected with the virus but *are not sick*.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, Fujian anatalikilana bwanji ndi chimphepoyi?","The correct answer is **D: Makilomita 77**.

The passage states: ""Kufikila pa usiku wapa 9 Ogasiti, diso la Morakot linali motalikilana ndi dela la Fujian **kwamakumi asanu ndi awiri**. "" This translates to ""As of the night of August 9th, the eye of Morakot was **77 kilometers** away from the coast of Fujian."" (50 + 27 = 77)



"
Anamulonjera George W. Bush atangofika ku Asia ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ndi Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

* The passage states he was welcomed by the Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng *and* had discussions with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. This indicates both individuals greeted and engaged with him upon his arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nduna yaikulu (The Prime Minister)** - While he *did* meet the Prime Minister, the passage specifically mentions being welcomed by the Deputy Prime Minister *first*.
* **B: Gulu la anthu (A group of people)** - The passage only names specific individuals.
* **D: Wachiwiri kwa nduna yaikulu (Deputy Prime Minister)** -  Only one person is named as welcoming him, but he also met the Prime Minister.



"
Kodi mtsogoleri wadziko anakamba pati za kukulitsa malonda a Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutsatira kuluza kwake kwa masankho a pakati pa ndime**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pambuyo pasabata yolephera zisankho zapakatikati, a Bush adawuza anthu zokuza za malonda ku Asia."" This directly translates to ""After a week following the mid-term elections, Bush spoke about expanding trade with Asia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Atangofika ku Singapore** - He discussed trade *with* the Prime Minister, but didn't make a speech about expanding it upon arrival.
* **B: Alindi Wong Kan Seng** - He spoke with Wong Kan Seng, but the passage doesn't mention him talking about expanding trade during that meeting.
* **D: Munthawi yonse ya sabata yake yaitali yatchuthi ku Asia** - The passage specifically links the statement to *after* the election results, not throughout the whole trip.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zili cholinga chenicheni cha boma?","The correct answer is **A: Kuthandiza zotengera kapena zonyamulira zambiri usanathe mwezi wa Malichi chaka chino**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the government made a pledge in March.** The additional 300 vehicles are meant to *fulfill* that pledge and reach a total of 1,300 needed to address population demand.
* **The focus is on meeting a deadline (before the end of March) and ensuring enough vehicles are available.**  Options B and C focus on *numbers* of vehicles, but not the overall *goal* of fulfilling the pledge. Option D is the opposite of what the passage describes.

Therefore, the primary goal of the government, as implied by the passage, is to have enough transport available before the end of March, fulfilling their earlier commitment.



"
Kodi boma linalengeza chani?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndiodzipeleka pothana ndi vuto la zotengera** (It is a commitment to address the transportation problem).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the government *already* made a promise in Malichi.** The additional 300 vehicles are *adding to* that initial commitment.
* **The goal is to reach 1,300 vehicles to solve a transportation problem (too many people).** This indicates a problem the government is actively trying to fix.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chikonzero chofuna kugula zotengera zokwanira 300** (The reason for wanting to buy 300 vehicles) - The passage doesn't focus on *why* they need 300 more, but rather that they *are* getting 300 more.
* **C: Chikonzero chofuna kugula zotengera zowonjezera zokwana 1,300** (The reason for wanting to buy an additional 1,300 vehicles) - The passage says they need 1,300 *total*, not an additional 1,300.
* **D: Vuto lakuchulukana lidzathetsedwa pofika Malichi** (The overcrowding problem will be solved by Malichi) - The passage states a commitment was made *in* Malichi, not *by* Malichi.  It also doesn't guarantee the problem will be solved *by* that date.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chisakudziwika?","The correct answer is **B: Palibiletu Chiopsezo china chilichonse**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement** directly says that a *decrease* in the *level* of danger doesn't mean the *entire* danger is gone.  This implies there could still be other dangers present, even if the initial one is reduced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chiopsezo chachepetsedwa** - The passage *acknowledges* a decrease in danger, it doesn't state it's unknown.
* **C: Zachiwembu zikuyembekezeredwa** - The passage *warns* against assuming a disaster won't happen again, it doesn't focus on expecting one.
* **D: Wothandizila kawuniwuni atsimikiza kuti kudzakhala chiwembu chodetsa nkhawa** - The passage doesn't mention any helper or assurance.



"
Ndimawu ati okhudza achionetsero omwe sioona?,"The correct answer is **B: Kukhalitsa kosachita zisankho kunapangitsa zionetsero**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the protests began due to the failure to hold elections (""Ziwonetsero zopanda mtendere zimayamba kamba kolephera kukhala ndi zisankho, zina kuyambira chaka cha 2011"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the President's Commission was a response, it was a *result* of the protests, not the protests themselves.
*   **C:** The protests led to pressure on the CEP, but the protests *caused* the pressure, not the other way around.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't focus on violence, but rather on the protests themselves as a result of not holding elections.



"
Analimbitsa kut a CEP akale atule pansi udindo ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **C: Komiti ya mtsogoleri wa dziko** (The President's Commission).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mwezi watha Commission ya Purezidenti idamema a CEP kuti asiye kaye pansi udindo wawo..."" (Last month the President's Commission asked the CEP to step down from their duties...). This directly indicates the President's Commission was the entity that urged the CEP to resign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Martelly:** While Martelly agreed with the decision, it was the *Commission* that made the request.
*   **B: Azionetsero:** The protests were a *result* of the election issues, not the cause of the CEP being asked to step down.
*   **D: Mamembala a CEP okhaokha ndi amene analimbikitsa:** The text doesn't say the CEP members themselves initiated their own resignation; they were *asked* to resign.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndi chani chimene a bungwe la masewero olimbitsa thupi la ku USA silinalimbikitse kutsatila khaza zimene othamanga anapangilidwa ndi Nassar?","The correct answer is **A: Kulanda chikalata chachitsimikizo** (Seeking certifications).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tikugwilizana ndi zomwe ananena USOC kuti chidwi chathu chili pa wosewera ndi makalabu, ndi masewera awo, zitha kupangidwa bwino popita chitsogolo ndi thandizo lomveka mu bungwe lathu, **kusiyana ndikulanda masatifiketi**."" 

This clearly indicates that USA Gymnastics is *not* prioritizing the pursuit of certifications, but instead focusing on internal support and improvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kupanga malo opeleka mphavu kwa anthu** (Creating safe havens) - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **C: Kufunikira kosintha maudindo mkati mwa bungwe** (The need for changes within the organization) - The passage *does* mention making changes (""kusintha kulikonse komanso koyenera""), but it's not what they are specifically *not* pursuing.
*   **D: Kufufuza koima pakokha** (Independent investigation) - The passage states they *are* supporting independent investigations.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi cholinga chachikulu cha onse a mukomiti a bungwe la masewero olimbitsa thupi la USA ndi a bungwe la United States la Olimpiki ndichani kupita chitsogolo?","The correct answer is **D: Kulimbikitsa malo otetezeka a anthu opanga masewera othamanga**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC share a goal of ""creating a safe sport environment...so that athletes can pursue their dreams safely.""
*   While the passage mentions the need to address the Larry Nassar abuse (A), it frames this as *part* of the larger goal of creating a safe environment, not the primary goal itself.
*   The passage directly states they are *not* focused on revoking certifications (B) and are actually shifting *away* from that.
*   The passage encourages independent investigations (C), but it’s presented as a *method* to achieve safety, not the ultimate goal.

Therefore, creating a safe environment for athletes is the overarching and stated primary goal."
Kodi sitima imapita kuti nthawi imene ngozi inachitika? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states the Avenger was ""on its way to Puerto Princesa ku Palawan"" (on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan) when the incident happened."
Ndi ziti zomwe sizoona zenizeni zokhudza sitima yomwe yafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi?,"The correct answer is **B: Imachokera ku Palawan**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the ship was *going to* Puerto Princesa in Palawan, not *from* Palawan. It originated from Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.
*   The other options are all directly stated as true in the text:
    *   **A: Inali ikupita ku Puerto Princesa** - The text says it was en route to Puerto Princesa.
    *   **C: Inali sitima yankhondo yam'madzi** - It's described as a naval minesweeper.
    *   **D: Inapelekedwa ku gulu la lalikulu la nkhondo la silikali apamadzi laku U.S.** - It was assigned to the Seventh Fleet.



"
Anapeleka mau okhudzana ndi a gulu lankhondo la US ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage explicitly states that President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. Therefore, he is the one who made the statement regarding the US military.



"
"Malingana ndi 'ndimeyi, ndi dziko liti limene linatenga udindo wolondera omenya nkhondo ogwidwa?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dziko la Turkey litengaso udindo woyang'anira asilikali omwe agwidwa pa nkhondo agulu la ISIS..."" (Turkey will take responsibility for monitoring captured ISIS fighters...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Syria** - The passage states US troops are *leaving* Syria, not taking on responsibility for prisoners.
*   **B: Ulaya** - The passage states European countries *refused* to take them back.
*   **C: Dziko la Amelika** - The passage states US troops are leaving and doesn't mention the US taking responsibility for the prisoners.



"
Ndichani chomwe akukhulupilira kuti ndichomwe chinagwetsa ndege ?,"The correct answer is **A: Malo ovuta**.

The passage states: ""akukhulupilira kuti zinachitika chifukwa cha adani a chiwembu."" (They believe it happened because of enemy action/sabotage). While the difficult terrain and bad weather *complicated* the search, they aren't what is believed to have *caused* the crash.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Moto woipa** - The passage doesn't mention fire.
*   **C: Malo a mapiri** - The mountains are where it happened, but not *why* it crashed.
*   **D: Nyengo yoyipa** - Bad weather hindered the search, but didn't cause the crash.



"
Ndi ntundu wanji wa malo amene ndege inagwera?,"The correct answer is **D: M'mapiri**.

The passage specifically states: ""Ngoziyi inachitikira **mwamba m'mapiri atali**..."" (The crash happened **high in the remote mountains**...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Udani** - This refers to the enemy, not a location.
*   **B: Nkhaza** - This doesn't appear in the text.
*   **C: Mgwirizano** - This refers to the coalition forces, not a location.



"
Kodi akuboma akukhulupirira kuti zotsatira zamadzi osefukila zikhala chani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubwezeletsa zitsuro za mchenga (Restoring sandbars)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ogwira ntchito kumeneku akuyembekezera kuti chikhala chokwanira kubwezeretsa mchenga umene udakokoloka kumusi kwa mtsinje.""  This directly translates to ""workers expect it to be enough to restore the sand that was washed away from the bottom of the river.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kupangidwa kwa magombe (Creation of beaches):** While the sandbars are related to beaches, the passage specifically focuses on restoring the *sandbars* themselves.
* **C: chiwelengero chochuluka cha zikopa za humpback (A large number of humpback chubs):** The passage states humpback chub are *endangered* due to the water diversion, not that their numbers will increase.
* **D: Malo ambiri okhalamo zakuthengo (More habitat for wildlife):**  While restoring the sandbars will *eventually* help wildlife habitat, the immediate expectation is sandbar restoration.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsatira zomwe nyumba yadamu inaonongelatu?,"The correct answer is **C: Malo okhalamo zakuthengo** (Wildlife habitats).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""This erosion was important for repairing sand and gravel, which serve as habitat for native animals.""  This directly links the erosion to the destruction of habitats.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: zitsuro za mchenga (sand reefs)** - While sand is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically say reefs were destroyed.
    * **B: zikopa za humpback (humpback spawns)** - The passage mentions humpback chub *fish*, not spawning grounds.
    * **D: Zotayika zofalikira (spreading losses)** - This is too vague and not directly related to the information given.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is that the dam destroyed wildlife habitats.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, anawadziwitsa a dziko la United States zakuthekera koti akhoza kuchitidwa chiwembu ndi ndani?","The correct answer is **C: Gwero losadziwika** (Unknown source).

Here's why:

The passage states the U.S. embassy received information ""from sources who requested anonymity"" regarding potential attacks. This means the sources remain unidentified. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akuluakulu a dziko la Somali** - The passage mentions ""people coming from Somalia"" but doesn't say Somali officials provided the warning.
* **B: Kazembe wa dziko la Ethiopia** - The Ethiopian embassy is not mentioned as the source of the warning.
* **D: Gwero la ku dziko la Kenya** - While Kenya is a target, the source of the information is not identified as being from Kenya.



"
Ndi mawu ati mwaotsatilawa amene akufotokoza molondola za chikonzero cha anthu achiwembu onyanyala?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuphulitsa mabomba ku maiko awiri**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the warning concerns attacks planned for both Kenya **and** Ethiopia.
* Option A only mentions one country.
* Option C refers to ""symbols of countries"" which isn't the focus of the warning – it's about attacks *in* the countries.
* Option D again only refers to one country.



"
Ndi ndani mwa anthu awa yemwe si loya?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Sakis Kechagioglou** is described as a lawyer.
* **George Nikolakopoulos** is described as a lawyer.
* **Petros Mantouvalos** is described as a member of the bar and a defense lawyer.
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is described as a journalist - specifically, a presenter on a television show (""Zoungla"").  He is not mentioned as having any legal qualifications.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only person listed who isn't a lawyer."
Ndi gulu liti la anthu a mkati mwa gulu lazamalamulo la greek lomwe kupezeka kwao pazochititsa manyazi sikukutchulidwa?,"The correct answer is **C: atola nkhani**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions scandals involving:

* **Judges:** Evangelos Kalousisi (arrested for fraud and misconduct)
* **Lawyers/Solicitors/Attorneys:** Implicated in issues relating to taking bribes and fraud. (Sakis Kechagioglou, George Nikolakopoulos, Petros Mantouvalos)
* **Prosecutors:** Also implicated in taking bribes and fraud.

The passage *does not* mention any wrongdoing by journalists (""atola nkhani""). In fact, the passage mentions a journalist (Makis Triantafylopoulos) *reporting* on the scandals, not being involved in them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oyimila milandu:** Petros Mantouvalos, a lawyer, is explicitly mentioned as being investigated.
* **B: Oweluza milandu:**  Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos, lawyers, are mentioned as being convicted.
* **D: Oyimila milandu:** This is the same as option A, and is incorrect for the same reason.



"
kodi India idataya ma wiketi angati?,"The correct answer is **B: Asanu ndi kawiri (Seven)**.

The text explicitly states: ""India idakwanitsa kuchidachita ma run 36 kutayaso ma wicket 7 kuti amalize ma inning."" (India managed to score 36 runs losing 7 wickets to finish the innings.)

Therefore, India lost 7 wickets."
"Malingana ndi 'ndimeyi, kodi zigoli zochuluka bwanji zama innings?","The correct answer is **C: Kuthamanga zana limodzi** (Run 100).

The passage states: ""Osewela pakati a Sachin Tendulkar ndi a Rahul Dravid anasewera bwino kwabasi ndipo anapanga wothamanga zana limodzi."" This directly translates to ""The batsmen between Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid played well and scored a century.""

Therefore, the highest score of the innings was 100 runs."
Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizinazetse kukhumudwa kwa a Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndondomeko yatsopano ya webusaiti yokhudza zolaula**.

Here's why:

The passage states Adam Cuerden was upset because:

*   He felt Wales dismissed him from the start (""adatinamiza kuchokera pamayambiliro"").
*   He felt Wales pretended to listen to him, then removed his artwork (""ponamizira kukhala ngati akutimvera, mpaka pamene adachotsa zaluso zake"").

Options B (kufufutidwa kwa zaluso za Wales - removal of Wales' artwork) and C (kusamveledwe ndi a Wales - being ignored by Wales) directly relate to Cuerden's stated frustrations. Option D (Zamabodza zokhudza chomwe chinapangitsa kuti zaluso zifufutidwe - Falsehoods about why the artwork was removed) also relates to the reason for his discontent.

However, the passage mentions a new policy regarding internet content (""kupangidwe malamulo ena okhudzana zachiwelewele patsamba la intaneti"") as a *result* of the controversy, not as something that *caused* Cuerden's upset. The new policy came *after* he was already frustrated with Wales.

Therefore, the new website policy is the one thing listed that didn’t contribute to Adam Cuerden's disappointment.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chinafufutidwa pa webusaiti?","The correct answer is **A: Luso**.

The passage specifically states: ""...mpaka pamene adachotsa **zaluso zake**.” (…until he removed his **art**). This is what was removed from the website and caused upset.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zolaula** - While the passage mentions the website had ""mamiliyoni ambiri"" (millions) of these, it doesn't say *zolaula* were removed, only that the removal sparked policy changes related to them.
* **C: Zolemba za a polisi** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Zofalitsa nkhani zomwe eniake ndi anthu** - The passage refers to Wikinews, but doesn't say this type of content was removed.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndiziti mwazotsatira izi zomwe a Amir Khan azakhale akuthandiza ngakhale anali ndi maganizo ake ngati munthu?","The correct answer is **C: Masewera a olimpiki mchaka cha 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his personal beliefs (""azimayi asamamenyane""), Amir Khan supported the British athletes at the 2012 London Olympics. This demonstrates he was actively involved in and supportive of the games, even though his views on women's boxing might have been different.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: amayi omenya** - He explicitly stated he *didn't* think women should fight, so supporting female fighters doesn't align with the passage.
*   **B: Nzake opikisana nawo kuchokera mu masewero amchaka cha 2004 a Olimpiki** - The passage doesn't mention anything about his support for competitors from the 2004 Olympics.
*   **D: Ena owina mendulo zasiliva** - The passage only mentions his own silver medal and doesn't talk about supporting other medalists.



"
Kodi a Peter Lenz anamwalira liti?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuchipatala**

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Pompopompo adathangatidwa ndi achipatala amene adali panseu pompo komanso adapita naye ku chipatala chakonko kumene adakamwalira."" This directly translates to ""He was quickly attended to by paramedics who were on the scene and taken to a nearby hospital where he died.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nthawi imene amakonzekera masewera** - He was injured *while* preparing, but didn't die then.
*   **B: Atagwa pa njinga yao** - He was injured when he fell, but didn't die immediately.
*   **D: Ali ndi achipatala am'njira** - He died *at* the hospital, not while with the paramedics in transit."
Xavier Zayat ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **B: Wothamanga wina**.

The text states that Xavier Zayat ""adagundidwa ndi wopikisana nawo wina a Xavier Zayat"" (was hit by another racer, Xavier Zayat). This clearly identifies Zayat as a fellow racer."
Ndi munyengo iti imene owulutsa ndege wamantha angakhale ndi kuthekera komvetsetsa magwiridwe ntchito amkati mwa ndege?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngati wapaulendo amachita manyazi ndi mantha awo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding how a plane works can help reduce fear of the unknown. Option A directly links to overcoming embarrassment about those fears, suggesting they are willing to learn and understand.  This willingness is key to benefiting from knowledge about the plane's operation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngati kupita kuulutsa kwawo kunazunguriridwa ndi mantha:** While true, this describes the *presence* of fear, not the potential for *understanding* how a plane works.
* **C: Ngati apaulendowu amakhudzika ndi mitundu yonse ya mayendedwe:** This is irrelevant to understanding airplane mechanics.
* **D: Ngati manthawa amachokera kuzochitika zoopysa zomwe sizogwirizana ndi kuuluka:** This suggests irrational fears, which might be harder to address with technical explanations.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that prices can vary across different aggregators *even for the same flight*. It recommends comparing what you find on search engines with the airline's website itself. This means the initial step to get the best prices is to compare prices across multiple sources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kufufuza mawebusaiti andege** - While searching airline websites is good, the passage says to *also* compare with aggregators.
*   **C: Kugula yekha tikiti yokwelera ndege** - Buying directly isn't the starting point; it's something you do *after* comparison.
*   **D: Kugula tikiti yokwelera ndege kwa othandizila ulendo** - The passage doesn't mention travel agents/agencies.



"
Ndi nthawi yanji imene nzako akunera kutsagana ndi katundu wotumizidwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Pamene zinthu zatumizidwa kudzera ndege yonyamula katundu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the friend's services are needed because shipping via cargo plane is slow due to customs and takes days. This is the specific situation where the friend's expedited shipping option becomes valuable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pamene kampani ikugwiritsa ntchito ndege zake** - The passage mentions large companies *have* their own planes, but the friend's service isn't related to that.
*   **C: Pamene zinthu zikutumizidwa ngati katutundu wofufuzidwa** - This is a faster option, but the passage implies it's expensive and the friend offers an alternative to *avoid* using it.
*   **D: Pamene katundu wotumizidwa akutengedwa ndi kampani yokulilapo** - The passage doesn't specify a problem with larger companies taking the shipments, just that smaller companies struggle with speed.

"Malingana ndindimeyi, Ndi ndani amene angapereke ma poyitsi opangitsa kukwera ndege motsika mtengo?","The correct answer is **A: Kampani ya ndege yosiyana kukhala mu m'mgwirizano wosiyana**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the benefits (points) offered vary, and frequent flyer points can be *better* with a different airline within the *same* alliance.  This directly supports the idea that exploring different airlines within an alliance could lead to getting more points and therefore cheaper flights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndege imene mwaikwera kwambiri kukhala mu m'mgwirizano womweo** - The passage explicitly cautions against *only* choosing the airline you fly most with.
* **C: Ndege imene mwaikwera kwambiri kukhala mu m'mgwirizano osiyana** - The passage discusses airlines within the *same* alliance, not different alliances.
* **D: Kampani ya ndege yosiyana kukhala mu m'mgwirizano wofanana** - This is a rephrasing of the correct answer and is therefore the most logical choice.

Of the options provided, only **B: Kuona (Sight/Vision)** relates to a body part specifically mentioned as being harmed by dangerous alcohol. While all senses *could* be affected by alcohol, the text directly links it to liver and skin damage.  Therefore, the best answer is **B**.

Here's why the other options are less correct:

*   **A: Kumvera (Hearing):** Not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Kulawa chakudya olo chakumwa (Taste of food or drink):** While taste can be affected by alcohol, it's not a direct consequence mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Fungo (Smell):** Not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chingachepetse zotsatila zomwe mowa ungawononge?","The correct answer is **C: Kumwa mulingo woyenera wa mowa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mowa umakhudza anthu mosiyana ndipo kudziwa mulingo wanu ndikofunikira kwambiri."" (Alcohol affects people differently and knowing your limit is very important.) This directly links knowing your limit to reducing harm.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kumwa mowa ndi methanol** - The passage warns *against* methanol, stating it can cause blindness or death.
* **B: Kumwa kachaso woletsedwa** - The passage warns against illegally produced alcohol, which is often dangerous.
* **D: Kumwa ndi anthu osiyanasiyana** - While social context might be relevant, the passage focuses on *individual* limits and the dangers of the alcohol itself.



"
Kodi mitengo yokwera yakatundu ilipati ku Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Chigawo cha Canal**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...mbiri yake, ndiponso chifukwa cha katundu wake amene ali mgulu lokwera mtengo mdzikomo."" (and also because of its valuable real estate).
* **The passage also identifies:** ""Boma la Canal (chidatchi: Grachtengordel)"" as the area in question. 

Therefore, the expensive real estate is located in the Canal area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mu malo ati osankhidwa ngati a cholowa chadziko a UNESCO:** While the area *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, the question asks where the expensive property is, not *where* it is recognized.
* **C: Madera omwe anachotsedwa kuchokera ku Binnenstad:** The passage does not state that the area was removed from Binnenstad.
* **D: Madera ambiri yakuya:** The passage does not mention any ""older areas"" but focuses specifically on the canal area.



"
Ndi chifukwa chani dera la Canal lili malo oti osankhidwa ngati a cholowa chadziko a UNESCO,"The correct answer is **A: Ndi mbiri ndi chikhalidwe** (It is history and culture).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the Canal Ring was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage site ""chifukwa cha chikhalidwe chawochawo komanso mbiri yake"" (because of its unique culture and its history). While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are *reasons why* it's a valuable area, not the primary reason for its UNESCO designation.
"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndiziti mwa izi zimapangitsa kukayendera Phnom Krom kukhala kwaphindu?","The correct answer is **A: Maonekedwe a Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maonekedwe a mdima amukachisi ndi mawonekedwe a nyanja yotchedwa Tonle Sap amapangitsa kukwela phiri kukhala koyenela."" This directly translates to ""The dark appearance of the temple and the view of Tonle Sap lake make climbing the mountain worthwhile.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kuyenda kudutsira njira ya Angkor** - The passage mentions the Angkor Pass is *required* for entry, but doesn't say traveling the Angkor route is a benefit itself.
*   **C: Kuona Siem Reap** - The passage states Phnom Krom is *near* Siem Reap, but doesn't suggest seeing Siem Reap is a benefit of visiting Phnom Krom.
*   **D: Ulendo woyenda pa bwato kunyanja** - While a boat trip is *possible* in conjunction with the visit, it's presented as an addition, not a reason why the visit is worthwhile on its own.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, chowayeneleza alendo kuti alowe kuPhnom Krom ndichani?","The correct answer is **C: Kupeza njira ya Angkor (Obtaining an Angkor Pass)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Angkor Pass imafunika kuti ulowe mu kachisi choncho musayiwale kubweletsa ziphaso zanu zolowela ndi kutulukila m'dziko mukamapita ku Tonle Sap."" This directly translates to ""An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your entry and exit visas when you go to Tonle Sap.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukwela modutsa kachisi wa Yasovarman (Climbing through the Yasovarman temple)** - While the temple is mentioned, the passage doesn't say climbing *through* it is the requirement for entry.
*   **B: Kuyenda mozungulira Siem Reap (Traveling around Siem Reap)** - The location of Phnom Krom is mentioned, but traveling around Siem Reap is not the entry requirement.
*   **D: Kuyenda pabwato mozungulira Tonle Sap (Traveling by boat around Tonle Sap)** - A boat trip on Tonle Sap can be *combined* with the visit, but it's not the entry requirement for Phnom Krom itself.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani mwa izi zomwe zingalepheletsa alendo kuyendera Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: ulendo wofuna ndalama zambiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maulendo azokopa alendo ndiwokwera mtengo..."" which translates to ""Tourist trips are expensive..."". This directly identifies cost as a barrier to visiting Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chidwi chawekha chokawona nyanja ya Ross** - The passage mentions the Ross Sea as a location trips go to, not something that would prevent someone from going.
* **C: Ndondomeko yakagwiridwe ka ntchito yokakulola kuyendela malo** - The passage doesn't mention any permitting process.
* **D: Mayendedwe apansi ovutilako** - While the passage does imply it's a physically demanding trip (""amatha kuchitika monga ku Chisumbu, Zilumba komaso kunyanja ya Ross.""), it doesn’t explicitly state that travel on the ground is difficult. It does mention challenging travel *across* the ice, but that's for researchers, not general tourists.



"
Alendo omwe alindi chidwi chokwera mapiri akhoza kukaona mbali iti ya Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Dera la mkati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nkatikati mwa Antartica muli phiri lokutidwa ndi madzi owuma kwa ntunda wautali ngati makilomita 2 mpaka 3. Akadaulo oyenda m'mwamba pena amayenda pamtunda, basi kulizungulira phiri kapena kufika kunsonga kwenikweni kwa dziko..."" 

This directly links mountaineers (people interested in climbing mountains) to the *central* area of Antarctica where the ice-covered mountain is located.  The passage mentions the mountain is in the middle of Antarctica, making ""Dera la mkati"" (central area) the correct answer.



"
Kodi ndikuti kumene malo a zinthu zakale zowonetsera angapezeke movutilako?,"The correct answer is **A: Kumalo osavuta kupeza**.

Here's why:

* **P** states that old observatories were built in places that were *easily* accessible - in cities or on campuses. It then contrasts this with modern observatories, which are built in remote, hard-to-reach areas.
* **Q** asks where old observatories are *likely to be found*.
* Therefore, the answer is places that were easily accessible. ""Kumalo osavuta kupeza"" translates to ""places that are easy to get to.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pakati pa mzinda (In the middle of the city):** While observatories *were* in cities, ""middle of the city"" isn't the general concept the passage emphasizes - just ease of access.
* **C: M'malo akumudzi (In the countryside):** The passage specifically says they *weren't* built in remote areas like the countryside.
* **D: Pamalo a sukulu ya ukachenjede (On a university campus):** While campuses are mentioned, ""easy access"" is the broader, more accurate answer."
Kodi chofufuzira chamakono cha telesikopu chikhoza kukhala kuti chikusungidwa kuti?,"The correct answer is **A: Kumalo osungilamo zinthu zakale** (Museums/Historical sites).

Here's why:

The passage (P) directly states that old observatories are now often ""malo wosungirapo zakalekale"" (places to keep antiques/historical artifacts).  It contrasts this with the modern trend of building telescopes in remote, optimal locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Malo a sukulu ya ukachenjede (School of witchcraft location):** This is irrelevant and not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Pamalo ophunzilira za sukulu (School learning location):** While old observatories *could* have been used for learning, the passage emphasizes their current status as historical sites.
* **D: Kumalo aakulu (Big places):** Too vague and doesn't relate to the passage's point about the changed function of old observatories.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi malo ati amphepete mwanyanja omwe angakhale ndi magombe opanda phokoso?","The correct answer is **C: Kumpoto kwa dera la Harbor (North Shore of the Harbour)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Magombe aku North Shore (m'boma la North Harbour) ... ali ngati pafupifupi onse ndi magombe amchennga okhala ndi malo osambira otetezeka, ndipo ambiri ali ndi nthuzi operekedwa ndi mitengo ya pohutukawa.""

This describes the North Shore beaches as being relatively quiet and sheltered, fitting the description of ""magombe opanda phokoso"" (quiet beaches).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Senti Heliers** and **B: Mission Bay**: The text says these areas on Tamaki Drive are ""magombe amabanja ochuluka kwambiri magombe omwe ali ndi masitolo abwino wokhala mumzere"" – implying they are busy and popular.
*   **D: ku Waitemata Harbor**: This is a general location, not a specific type of beach known for being quiet."
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndikuti kumene kukhoza kukhala ndondomeko zoteteza osambira m’madzi?","The correct answer is **A: Doko la Devon**.

Here's why:

The text states that the North Shore beaches (which include areas near Devonport) are ""mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming areas."" This directly implies safety measures for swimmers are in place. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kumpoto kwa dera la Harbor** - This is too broad. While the beaches are *in* the North Harbour area, the text specifically highlights the safety features of the beaches themselves, near Devonport.
* **C: Chigawo chapakati cha Auckland** - The text mentions Tamaki Drive beaches (Mission Bay and St Heliers) as being in central Auckland, and states they are safe for swimming, but Devonport is specifically described as having safe swimming areas.
* **D: Long Bay** - Long Bay is mentioned as part of the North Shore beaches, but the text doesn't single it out as having specific safety measures. Devonport is more explicitly linked to safe swimming.

"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi Pamane akuyendera madera, ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zikanaoneka ngati zosayenera?","The correct answer is **C: Kuchita nthabwala**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Osachita nthabwala za kuphedwa kwa ntundu wa anthu kapena Nazi."" (Do not joke about the murder of a people or the Nazis). This directly condemns joking or trivializing the horrific events that occurred at these sites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchita mwaulemu** - The passage *encourages* respectful behavior (""apatseni malowa ulemu waukulu ndi oyenera"").
*   **B: Kusiya zizindikiro penapake kuzungulira delaro** - The passage doesn't mention leaving markers.
*   **D: Kukanda kapena kukhula m'nyumba** - The passage warns against defacing or altering the memorial (""Osachita nthabwala za kuphedwa kwa ntundu wa anthu kapena Nazi. Osaononga zolembazo polembapo zina kapena kukhulapo kuti zikhale zinthu zina."").



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zikufotokoza ziyankhulo zalingua francas?,"The correct answer is **D: Chopangidwa ndi zachilengedwe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ziyankhulo zothandizira zimachita kupangidwa ndi anthu..."" (Auxiliary languages are created by people...) and contrasts them with French, which are ""zilankhulo zachilengedwe"" (natural languages).  This means *lingua francas* are **created**, not naturally occurring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chochita kupanga** (Doing creation) - This doesn't describe what a lingua franca *is*, only that it's made.
* **B: chosakhala chachilengedwe** (Non-natural) - While true, this doesn't fully capture the meaning. It just says what it *isn't*.
* **C: Choumbidwa** (Imposed) - The passage doesn't mention anything about imposition.

Therefore, ""chopangidwa ndi anthu"" (created by people) is the best fit for describing a lingua franca, as described in the text.  It’s the defining characteristic that sets it apart from natural languages.



"
Ndi mawu ati amene sakufotokoza molondola za ziyankhulo zothandizila?,"The correct answer is **B: Pali ziyankhulo zomwe zonse ndi zachilengedwe ndizochita kupanga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that constructed languages (ziyankhulo zothandizira) are *made* by people, distinguishing them from natural languages (ziyankhulo za ku France).**  This directly contradicts the idea that they are *all* natural and constructed.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Pali ziyankhulo zachilengedwe zomwe zimagwiritsidwa polumikizana pakati pa anthu omwe sangathe kumvetsetsana** - The passage explains constructed languages are designed to *facilitate* communication where natural languages fail.
* **C: Pali ziyankhulo zomwe zinapangidwa kuti zikonze mayankhulidwe ovuta** - This aligns with the passage's description of their purpose - to avoid difficulties in understanding.
* **D: Ndi ziyankhulo zomwe zinapangidwa ndikutenga malo pakati pa anthu aziyankhulo zosiyanasiyana** - This is also a correct description; they bridge the gap between speakers of different languages.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chomwe apaulendo akuyenera kufufuza za bwato lawo mu nyengo yozizira?","The correct answer is **A: Malo nyumba** (Shelter location).

Here's why:

The passage specifically says ""Ngati muwoloka kumpoto kwa Baltic m'nyengo yozizira, yang'anani komwe kuli kanyumba..."" which translates to ""If you find yourself north of the Baltic Sea in winter, look for a shelter..."" This directly indicates that travelers should locate a shelter in case of emergency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zofunikira pa chikalata chachilolezo chokuyeneleza kuyenda ulendo** (Visa requirements): While the passage mentions visas, it's a general note and not the primary thing to *look for* during a crossing.
*   **C: Zoyenera kutsatila** (Rules to follow): The passage doesn't focus on rules, but rather safety precautions.
*   **D: Nthawi yomwe mungakhale ku tawuni** (Time spent in town): The passage mentions time for travel to Saint Petersburg but doesn't ask the traveler to look for that.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ngati wapaulendo akuyenda nthawi yotentha, ndichani chomwe angathe kupewa?","The correct answer is **B: Kuyenda pa madzi a ayisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that crossing the Baltic Sea during winter is dangerous (""kumabweretsa phokoso lowopsa kwa iwo omwe akhudzidwa kwambiri"") and advises looking for a ferry. This implies that in winter, you *have* to deal with potentially dangerous sea crossings. The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding town stays, visa requirements in warm weather, or a ""clean"" St. Petersburg. Therefore, a traveler can avoid the danger mentioned in the passage by traveling during a warmer time of year when the sea isn't frozen.



"
Ndi chifukwa chani chiyankhulo cha chiCatalan nchimagwiritsidwa ntchito pafupafupi pazolengeza komanso pa zizindikiro ku Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Chinali chiyankhulo choyamba chokhazikika cha mzinda.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**zizindikiro zochuluka zimaonetsedwa mu chilankhulo cha Chikatalani basi chifukwa chinakhazikitsidwa ndi malamulo ngati chilankhulo choyamba chovomerezeka.**"" This directly supports the idea that Catalan was the originally established language of the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chimamveka bwino kusiyana ndi chiyankhulo cha Spanish:** The passage doesn't mention anything about ease of understanding.
*   **C: Ndi chiyankhulo chokondedwa ku Barcelona:** While the passage states ""Theka la anthu amakonda kuyakhula Catalan,"" this doesn't explain *why* it's used on signs and announcements.
*   **D: Ku Metro ndi malo ena aboma kumadzadza ndi anthu amene amayankhula chiyankhulo cha Catalan:** The passage indicates that everyone understands Spanish, and Catalan speakers are only half the population. This doesn't justify making Catalan the primary language for public information.



"
Ndi ziti mwaziyankhulo zotsatilazi zomwe zimagwiritsidwa mu ndondomeko ya Metro ku Barcelona popanga zolengeza pafupipafupi?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Zolengeza za nthawi zonse mu Metro zimapangidwa muchilankhulo chachi Kalatani basi..."" (Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in the Catalan language...).

While Spanish is widely understood and used, routine announcements are *specifically* in Catalan. The other languages (English, French, Arabic, Japanese) are used for *unexpected* disruptions."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, Ndiziti mwazothandizila zotsatilazi zomwe sangaziike patsogolo pa pamwamba pakama labwino ndi chakudya cha m’mawa?","The correct answer is **D: Intaneti yachangu**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the charm and traditional qualities of excellent B&Bs. It highlights things like:

*   **Zofunda (Bedding):** High-quality, handmade or seasonal bedding.
*   **Kadzutsa (Breakfast):** Local, seasonal, or host-prepared specialty breakfasts.
*   **Malowa (Grounds):** Historic buildings, beautiful gardens, and pools.

These are all explicitly mentioned as areas where B&Bs compete to be the best.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Menyu yokhala ndi zakudya zapadera (A menu with special foods):** The passage *specifically* states that excellent B&Bs offer unique, host-prepared breakfasts.
*   **B: zipangizo zapadera zakale (Special antique furniture):** The passage mentions historic houses with old features, implying antique furniture would be part of the appeal.
*   **C: Malo apanja osamalidwa bwino (Well-maintained garden areas):** Beautiful gardens are directly mentioned as a desirable feature.

**Intaneti yachangu (Fast internet)** isn't mentioned at all and doesn't fit the theme of traditional charm and local experience emphasized in the passage. It is a modern convenience that isn't presented as a priority for a top-tier B&B in this context.



"
"Kutengera ndi ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwa izi yomwe simfundo yeniyeni ya mpikisano wapakati pa mwanaalilenji wa B ndi B?","The correct answer is **C: Zofunda zapamwamba (High-quality bedding)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""B&Bs chachidziwikire imapikisana kwambiri pa zinthu ziwiri: Zofunda ndi Kadzutsa."" (B&Bs are known to compete strongly on two things: Bedding and Breakfast.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zokongoletsera zamakono (Modern decorations)** - The passage mentions historical homes with old features, not modern decorations.
*   **B: Zakudya zam’mawa zomwe zimaperekedwa munyengo zina (Breakfast foods offered seasonally)** - While mentioned as a *possible* breakfast feature, it's not highlighted as a core competitive point.
*   **D: Zokudya ndi zokumwa zomwe zimapezeka mudera (Foods and drinks available in the area)** - This is also mentioned as a possibility for breakfast, but not the primary competition factor.

Ndi ndani amene ali pachiopsezo kuti akhoza kutenga chinfine cha mbalame chotchedwa avian influenza?,"The correct answer is **A: Osamalira mbalame** (Bird caretakers).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ambiri agwiritsa ntchito anthu amene amagwira ntchito ndi nkhuku, koma palinso chiopsezo kwa amene amakaonelera kuwuluka kwa mbalame.""  This directly includes bird caretakers/those who observe birds.
* While options B and C are related, they are more specific (animal workers and chicken farmers). The passage includes a broader category – anyone caring for birds.
* Option D is irrelevant, as having been sick before doesn't increase risk of avian influenza.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ndemanga iti yomwe zikufotokoza molondola za chimfine cha mbalame?","The correct answer is **C: Oyang'anira mbalamezi ali pa chiopysezo chotenga matenda**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...palinso chiopsezo kwa amene amakaonelera kuwuluka kwa mbalame."" (There is also a risk for those who observe bird migration.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Okhawo oweta nkhuku ndi amene atenga chimfine** - The passage says most cases are in people working with poultry, but *also* mentions a risk for bird watchers.
* **B: Matenda ambiri adwala ndi anthu kusiyana ndi mbalame** - The passage states the disease affects birds *and* mammals, and while there have been human cases, it doesn't say more humans than birds have been affected.
* **D: Matenda onse amene anakalembetsa anthu apezeka kuti ndiakupha** - The passage states *some* cases were fatal, not all.



"
Kodi chimalumukiza nyanja yoyera-ngalande ya Baltic ndi chani?,"The correct answer is **B: Nyanja ya Onega ndi mtinjewa Volga**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nyanja ya Onega idagundanizananso ndi Volga, choncho ndikotheka kuchoka ku Nyanja ya Caspian kudutsa ku Russia."" This means the Onega Sea and the Volga River connect the Caspian Sea to the White Sea-Baltic Canal route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyanja yakuda ndi nyanja ya Caspian:** While the Vikings used waterways *to* these seas, they don't connect the White Sea-Baltic route *directly*.
*   **C: Nyanja ya Arctic and Nyanja ya Baltic:** These are endpoints of the route, not what connects it internally.
*   **D: Nyanja ya kum'mwera ndi nyanja ya utoto ofiira:** These seas are not mentioned in the text and are geographically irrelevant to the described routes.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mtundu wanji wagalimoto omwe anthu akhoza kumatengelapo ziphaso zapaulendo kutinso asasokoneze apaulendo?","The correct answer is **B: Sitima zogonamo usiku** (Night trains).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Masitima ogona usiku, ziphaso zoyendera zimatha kutengedwa ndi wochititsa kuti musalore kuti kugona kwanu kusokonezedwe.""  This directly links the possibility of having tickets checked to night trains to prevent disturbance during sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndege (Planes)** - The passage mentions planes as examples of transport, but doesn't say tickets are specifically taken on them for sleep reasons.
*   **C: Mabwato (Boats)** - The passage doesn't mention boats.
*   **D: Masitima olowa ndikutuka dziko lina (Trains entering and leaving another country)** - While these trains require travel documents, the passage doesn't connect them to ticket checks for sleep disturbance.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, Ndi nthawi iti imene chaunzika chako chikhoza kuonedwa utakwera sitima yolowa ndikutuka dziko lina?","The correct answer is **A: Pamene wa tsika sitima** (When you disembark the train).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Oyendela mmasitima ena apantunda owoloka amalire a maiko amayendela sitima ikuyenda ndiye muyenela kukhala ndi makalata oyenela a ulendo pokwela.""  This means your travel documents will be checked when you *get off* the train at a border crossing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pamene ukugona** (When you are sleeping): While the passage mentions tickets might be taken during overnight journeys to avoid disturbance, it doesn't say documents are checked then.
* **C: Siimafufuziwa** (Not mentioned): This isn't related to the text.
* **D: Pamene sitima ikuthamanga** (When the train is moving): The text specifies checking happens at border crossings, which implies stopping or disembarking.



"
Ndimavuto ati mwaotsatilawa omwe alindikuthekera kukwera pamene mukukhala kumalo otentha a Singapore?,"The correct answer is **A: kupangidwa chitaka** (heatstroke).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states Singapore is hot and has strong sun.** This directly links to the risk of heatstroke.
* **Option B** is incorrect because the passage says you can buy almost anything.
* **Option C** isn't directly related to the described climate.
* **Option D** is a general feeling and not a specific health risk caused by the heat.

Therefore, the most logical problem to experience in a hot climate like Singapore, as described in the passage, is heatstroke.
"
Ndi ndani amene akhoza kumapewa kudya mikate yaku German?,"The correct answer is **A: Wina amene alindi ziwengo zantedza (Someone who has nut allergies)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that German baking frequently uses almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Someone with a nut allergy would need to avoid these baked goods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wina amene amakonda chakudya chapamwamba choonjezera (Someone who prefers high-end cuisine):** The passage doesn't suggest the pastries are *not* high-end, just that they are common and sometimes fatty.
*   **C: Wina amene sakonda chokoleti (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** Chocolate isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Wina amene amakonda zinthu zotsekemela kusiyana ndi zithu zokoma mwachilengedwe (Someone who prefers savory things to sweet things):** While the treats are sweet, this isn't a reason to *avoid* them, simply a preference.



"
Ndizopangira zakudya zanji zanyengo zomwe amapangira mikate ya ku German?,"The correct answer is **A: Apulo**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""...mikate ya zipatso imapezeka kwambiri, ma apple amapangira mikate chaka chonse..."" (Fruit cakes are common, apples are used to make cakes all year round).

While hazelnuts, almonds, and cherries *are* used in German baking, apples are highlighted as being used year-round, making them the most prominent seasonal ingredient mentioned for cake-making.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mfundo iti mwa izi yomwe siyoyenele kuchita paulendo woti mwapanga kale ndondomeko yazachuma?","The correct answer is **C: kupempha anthu ndalama**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the advice *doesn't* condone ""kupemphetsa kapenanso kubela anthu ena"" (begging or exploiting others).  This directly refers to asking people for money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupeza ntchito zina zachilendo zomwe utha kumagwira mukuyenda** - The passage mentions working while traveling as one of the general approaches to affordable travel.
*   **B: Kukhala omasuka ndi mulingo wa zinthu zomwe ungakwanitse** - This aligns with the idea of a minimalist travel budget.
*   **D: Kuchepetsa zinthu zogwiritsila ntchito pa zakudya ndi malo ogona** - This is directly in line with the focus on reducing expenses.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, Ndi ndani amene akhoza kukhala ndi vuto kuyenda ndindondomeko yandalama yochepa?","The correct answer is **A: Wina amene amavomeleza zovuta**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""zero-spending travel plan"" is for those willing to give up comfort, time, and potentially endure hardship (implied by needing to drastically reduce spending). This suggests someone who *isn't* willing to accept difficulties would struggle with this type of travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wina amene alibe choletsa nthawi:** The passage actually mentions giving up *time* as a requirement.
* **C: Wina amene alindi chikonzero chogwira ntchito mwapatalipatili pamene akuyenda:** The passage contrasts this zero-spending approach *with* working while traveling.
* **D: Wina amene amakonda kutsatila zamaulendo:**  This implies someone who enjoys typical travel, which likely involves spending money, making them less suited for a zero-spending plan.



"
Ndi mfundo iti mwazotsatilazi yomwe sikufotokoza molondola za kayendedwe pakati pa Marion ndi Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **D: Ntchito za foni yamanja zisakhale vuto.**

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states that there is *strong* cell phone service in this area, *more* than in other parts of the route. This directly contradicts the statement that cell phone service would be a problem.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Kuli misewu italiitali m’madera ena akumidzi mdziko** - The passage describes the roads as long, winding, and narrow, which aligns with what one would expect in rural areas.
*   **B: Misewu ndiyothina** - The passage explicitly mentions ""misese ikuluikulu, misewu yothithikizana"" (winding roads).
*   **C: Mulingo wakathamangidwe sumatsatiridwa kwenikweni** - The passage states that speed limit signs seem low and to follow them is important because the roads are challenging. This suggests people may try to go faster, but should adhere to the limits.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndiziti mwaizi zomwe zikuyenera kukhala nkhawa ya oyendetsa omwe akuyenda?","The correct answer is **C: Kukhota chakutwa mwachangu kwambiri**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions ""misese ikuluikulu, misewu yothithikizana, komaso misewu yokhotakhota kwambiri"" (large hills, winding roads, and very twisting roads) as challenges for drivers. It also emphasizes the importance of following the speed limits (35-40mph) due to the road conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutsakamila mumsewu chifukwa chamagalimoto ochuluka** - The passage doesn't mention heavy traffic as a major concern.
*   **B: Kupelewera potumikira ntchito za makasitomala a foni zam’manja** - The passage actually states there's *good* cell phone service in this area, so this is the opposite of a concern.
*   **D: Kukumana ndi ntchito zapansewu kawirikawiri** - The passage doesn't discuss road work frequency.



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizimaloleredwa kuyamba masewera a canyoneering,"The correct answer is **B: Pachimake pa thanzi** (Poor health).

Here's why:

The passage states canyoneering *requires* minimal training or athleticism to begin, but implies good physical condition is necessary. It contrasts it with activities like swimming and climbing which *do* require significant training.  Being in poor health would clearly be a barrier to safely participating in canyoneering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutha kusambira m'madzi** (Ability to swim) - The passage specifically states canyoneering requires *less* training than swimming.
*   **C: Kutha kudumpha** (Ability to jump) - The passage mentions jumping is *part* of canyoneering.
*   **D: Mphunziro lapadera lochepa** (Minimal special training) - The passage explicitly states canyoneering requires minimal special training.



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zikhoza kukhala zofunikira ku chionetsera cha masewera opambana a canyon?,"The correct answer is **C: Chiphaso cha canyoneering**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) describes canyoneering** – going down canyons, often involving water, scrambling, climbing, and jumping. It specifically states it requires *less* formal training than related activities like rock climbing or mountaineering, but it's still a specialized activity.
* **A canyoneering certification (Chiphaso cha canyoneering)** would demonstrate competency and safety knowledge for this activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Lunso lapadera lamasewera othamanga (Special sports shoes):** While good shoes are important, they are just *equipment*. A certification shows understanding of the entire process, not just having the right gear.
* **B: Kuchita za kusambira pansi pa madzi m'mbuyomu (Previous scuba diving experience):** Scuba diving is a different skill set. While being comfortable in water is helpful, it doesn't specifically qualify someone for canyoneering.
* **D: kutha kusambira (Ability to swim):**  The passage suggests canyoneering *can* involve water, but it isn’t exclusively about swimming.  The passage points out it can also be done in *dry* canyons.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chingamuthandize munthu amene akukonzekera kumanga masasa mugalimoto yake?","The correct answer is **B: Galimoto imene imatheka kuthyola mpando** (A vehicle that can fold its seats).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kukhala mugalimoto ndikotheka ngati muli ndi galimoto lokulirapo la minivan, SUV, Sedan kapena Station Wagon ndi mipando yoti itha kugonekedwa."" (Sleeping in a car is possible if you have a larger vehicle like a minivan, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon *with seats that can be folded down*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kudziwa bwino galomoto yako ndi zoofooka zake** (Knowing your car well and its weaknesses) - While helpful for a road trip generally, this isn't specifically about *sleeping* in the car.
* **C: Hema** (Tent) - The passage suggests that setting up a tent can be unnecessary and might attract unwanted attention.
* **D: Kumanga msasa pamalo ayekha** (Building a bush camp in a secluded area) - The passage contrasts car camping with going to a “bush camp,” implying they are different things.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kukhoma chihema pamalo anu kapena mumzinda waung'ono uliwonse kungathe kubweletsa chidwi chosafunikira."" This directly implies that camping (setting up a tent) will attract unwanted attention, making it harder to remain unnoticed (""off the radar"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuyendera magalimoto akuluakulu, ngati SUV kapena minivan** - The passage suggests these *facilitate* car living, they don't make you more noticeable.
*   **B: Kuyenda ulendo wautali** -  A long trip isn't mentioned as something that attracts attention.
*   **D: Kusaidziwa galimoto yomwe akugwiritsa ntchito** - The passage says knowing your car well is *beneficial*, not something to avoid.

"Kutengera zimene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ndani amene anamanga Casablanca kachiwiri?","The correct answer is **A: A Portuguese**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Apwitikizi adaphwasula nkuimanganso nkuitcha dzina loti Casa Branca koma adawasiya malowa potsatila chivomelezi mu chaka cha 1755.""  This translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, calling it Casa Branca, but abandoned the place following an earthquake in 1755.""

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who rebuilt Casablanca.



"
Anazemba mzinda wamakono wa Casablanca kutsatira chivomelezi ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **B: A Portuguese**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Apwitikizi adaphwasula nkuimanganso nkuitcha dzina loti Casa Branca koma adawasiya malowa potsatila chivomelezi mu chaka cha 1755."" This translates to: ""The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, calling it Casa Branca, but abandoned the place following an earthquake in 1755.""

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who rebuilt and then abandoned the city following the earthquake."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi Sintra anadziwika bwanji pakati pa anthu amaiko ena?","The correct answer is **C: Ndemanga zachilimbitso za Lord Byron**.

The passage states that Sintra became famous internationally ""kamba kazokambakamba zakukongola kwake zomwe zidalembedwa ndi a Lord Byron"" (because of the comments of beauty written by Lord Byron). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** This is a place the bus stops *near* Sintra, not what Sintra was known for.
* **B: Maonekedwa a Marian:** These are associated with Fatima, not Sintra.
* **D: Mbiri yachikondi:** The passage doesn't mention a love story connected to Sintra.



"
Ndi chani chimene sichimavomelezedwa ndi Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Dziko loyima palokha latsopano**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""palibe dziko lokhazikika-ngakhale dziko la Armenia-lidavomereza za lipabuliki"" (no established country - even Armenia - recognized the new republic). This means Armenia did *not* recognize the newly formed republic of Nagorno-Karabakh as a sovereign nation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chigawo cha Nagorno-Karabakh** - Armenia supported the region, not disputed it.
*   **B: Nkhondo yolimbana ndi Azeris** - Armenia *supported* the fighting against the Azeris.
*   **C: Mkangano wa akazembe a Azerbaijan** - The passage says the dispute *damages* relations, not that Armenia disputes the diplomatic conflict itself.



"
Ndichani chimene chikupitilira kusokoneza ubale wapakati pa Azerbaijan ndi Armenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Mkangano wa akazembe** (Diplomatic disputes).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mkangano waukazembe okhuza deralo zikupitilira kuwononga ubale pakati pa Armenia ndi Azerbaijan."" (Diplomatic disputes regarding the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Armenian amene amakhala ku Azerbaijan** (Armenians living in Azerbaijan) - While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is *part* of the history, the passage focuses on the disputes, not simply their existence.
* **B: Nkhondo ya chaka cha 1994** (The 1994 war) - The war *caused* the disputes, but it's the ongoing disputes that are currently damaging the relationship.
* **D: Chigawo cha Nagorno-Karabakh** (The Nagorno-Karabakh region) - The region is the *source* of the dispute, but the dispute *itself* is what's affecting the relationship.



"
"Pamene ukutenga taxi ku Charlotte, ndi chani chimene chingapangitse kuti mtengo uwonjezeredwe?","The correct answer is **B: Kukhala ndi apaulendo atatu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pali kuonjezera malipilidwe anthu awili akakhala pa mpando, choncho izi zimakhala zokwelerapo mtengo."" This directly means there's an extra charge for having more than two passengers (a family, in this context).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukhala dera lina** - The passage doesn't mention extra charges based on location.
*   **C: Kupita kuntunda kwa tawuni** - The passage doesn't mention extra charges based on distance.
*   **D: Kukhala banja lochezeka** - While the passage mentions Charlotte being family-friendly, it doesn’t indicate a surcharge just for *being* a family. The surcharge is specifically for *additional passengers*.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichani chomwe chikhoza kuoneka kuti ndichochepa kuti ukhale ku Charlotte ndi ana?","The correct answer is **B: kukwera taxi** (taking a taxi).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Magalimoto amatola samagwiritsidwa ntchito ndi mabanja ku Charlotte, ngakhale akhoza kukhala othandiza munjira zina. Pali kuonjezera malipilidwe anthu awili akakhala pa mpando, choncho izi zimakhala zokwelerapo mtengo.""

This directly indicates that taxis can be *expensive* for families in Charlotte due to extra charges, making them a potentially undesirable option.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mtengo wanyumba** (Cost of housing) - The passage doesn't mention anything about housing costs being a drawback.
*   **C: Antu okhala madera ena** (People living in other areas) - The passage actually says people *choose* to live in Charlotte *because* of its family-friendly nature.
*   **D: Kuyesera kusangalala mu mzinda** (Trying to have fun in the city) - The passage states the city is *easy* to enjoy with children, the opposite of a drawback.



"
"Spain isanatenge ulamuliro, ndi ndani amene amalamulira kumpoto kwa Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nthawi imene anthu aku Spain asadafike muzaka zamazana 16, kumpoto kwa Chile amalamuliridwa ndi Inca..."" (Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was ruled by the Incas...).



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizinachitike mu chaka cha 1810?","Yankho loyenera ndi **B: A chile anapambana kuponsa a Spanish**.

Kodi anthu angafikile bwanji madera akumidzi a chigawo cha Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Pa sitima kapena bwato**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Njira, masitima ndi maboti amalumikiza midzi, chifukwa magalimoto sangafikeko."" This directly translates to ""Paths, trains, and boats connect the villages, because cars cannot reach them."" 

Therefore, to reach the villages, you use trains or boats.

Zomwe zikunenedwa mu ndimeyo zikuwonetsa kuti ""Cinque Terre"" zikutanthauza ""Maiko Asanu"", ndipo zikuloŵa midzi isanu."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mtundu uti wansapato yomwe ikuyenela kuvalidwa mu nyengo yozizira komanso misewu yoterera?","The correct answer is **A: Nsapato ya chidendene chopapatiza** (Shoes with good treads).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of ""zidendene zabwino"" (good treads)** for winter conditions and slippery surfaces. It states treads should be ""zotsika komanso zotambalala"" (low and widespread).
* It specifically mentions that warm-weather shoes are often too smooth (""zotelera pa madzi wowuma ofewa"").
* While the passage mentions longer studs or devices, the primary recommendation is for shoes *with* good, built-in tread.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nsapato ya chedendene chachitsulo** (Shoes with metal studs) - The passage does mention studs, but doesn't specifically recommend *metal* studs, and the focus is on tread.
* **C: Nsapato yachidendene chachitali** (Shoes with long studs) - The passage mentions long studs as *one* option, but good tread is the primary advice.
* **D: Nsapato zopanda chedendene chotalika mainchesi asanu(1/5inchesi)** (Shoes without treads at least 5 inches (1/5 inches) long) - This is the opposite of what the passage recommends. It states tread depth should be *at least* 5mm (1/5 inch)."
Ndi ziti mwazotsatirazi zomwe singathandize kuonjera chikoka pa misewu ya madzi owundana/musewu ya ayezi munyengo yozizira?,"The correct answer is **D: Madzi**.

Here's why:

The text states that sand, salt (calcium chloride), and grit are *added* to roads to *reduce* slipperiness. Water, on the other hand, *creates* ice when it freezes, and therefore *increases* slipperiness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mchere (Salt)** - The passage explicitly says salt is used to reduce slipperiness.
*   **B: Dothi lamiyala (Grit)** - The passage explicitly says grit is used to reduce slipperiness.
*   **C: Mchenga (Sand)** - The passage explicitly says sand is used to reduce slipperiness.

"
Ndiziti mwazotsatila za malo a alenje omwe amapeleka mitundu iwiri yamalo ogona kuti anthu asakhape?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku Sirena**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena ndimalo okhawo a alenje kumene alendo amagona ngati gulu, kumapezeka chakudya chotentha kuphatikizapo misasa."" This means Sirena is the *only* ranger station offering both food *and* lodging for groups. The other options (Los Patos, La Leona, and San Pedrillo) only offer lodging (misasa) without food."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndikuti kumene ukhoza kusungitsa chilolezo chako choyendera kumalo osungilako zinyama zosiyanasiyana ngati umafuna ulipile ndalama m’malo mwa ngongole","The correct answer is **C: Ku CafeNet El Sol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""CafeNet El Sol imapanga zosungitsa malo pamtengo wa $30, komanso $10 kwa tsiku limodzi..."" This directly translates to ""CafeNet El Sol makes reservations for a fee of $30, plus $10 per day...""  The question asks where you can *pay* to reserve a permit, and CafeNet El Sol is the only place mentioned that directly offers this service for a fee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku Sirena:** Sirena is a location *within* the park you need a permit to *access*, not a place to *get* a permit.
*   **B: Ku Puerto Jiménez:** Puerto Jiménez is where you get the permits at the Ranger Station, but you need to pay with cash, not a credit card. The question refers to paying with money/fees, not just obtaining the permit.
*   **D: Ku La Leona:** La Leona only offers camping, not permit reservations.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi kayendedwe ka pa ayisi kamtudu wanji kamene kamachitika pa malo otsika kwambiri","The correct answer is **B: Backcountry ski**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Kubelekera chikwama kumsana chifukwa cha ski"" (which translates to backcountry skiing) is a form of skiing done *off-piste* (away from groomed slopes). It's described as a way of traveling across the terrain, and while it can overlap with mountaineering, it's distinct.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukwera mapiri (Mountaineering)**: The passage states mountaineering *can* involve skiing, but it's not the primary focus and often uses different equipment.
*   **C: Kapangidwe ka Alphine (Alpine style)**: This term isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Kubelekera chikwama kunsana ndi ski (Skiing with a backpack)**: While backcountry skiing *involves* skiing with a backpack, the term ""backcountry ski"" itself refers to the activity, not just the act of carrying a backpack while skiing.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndi chani chimene chingathandize Backcountry skiera","The correct answer is **C: Nyengo zabwino**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Munyengo zabwino mudzatha kuyenda mwina maulendo atali kuposa kuyenda..."" (In good weather you will be able to travel perhaps longer distances than hiking...). This directly links good weather to being able to backcountry ski effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nsapato zolimba (Sturdy boots):** The passage contrasts backcountry skiing with alpine skiing which *requires* sturdy boots and long shoes, but doesn't say backcountry skiing specifically benefits from them.
*   **B: Chikwana chobelekera kumbuyo cholemela (Heavy backpack):** The passage says backcountry skiing is *without* a heavy backpack, which is a key difference from other mountain activities.
*   **D: Njanji zokonzedwa (Groomed trails):** The passage specifically states backcountry skiing is done on ungroomed slopes, so groomed trails would not help.



"
Apaulendo amene akumana ndi chikhalidwe chatsopano amavutika kupanga chani?,"The correct answer is **D: Kukhazikikanso muchikhalidwe chakwawo** (Re-establishing in their own culture).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the difficulties of *returning* home.** It describes the struggle of readjusting to one's original culture after being away and becoming accustomed to a new one.  The ""kukhumudwa kamba kobwelera kumudzi"" (the hardship of returning home) is the central theme.
* **Option A** is about adapting to a *new* culture, which is the opposite of the passage's main point.
* **Option B** describes how others should treat returning travelers, not the travelers' struggle.
* **Option C** is simply the act of traveling, not the readjustment process.

The passage explicitly states that people returning from abroad find themselves used to the foreign culture and struggling to remember aspects of their original culture (""utaiwala makhalidwe ako ena akwanu""). This directly relates to the difficulty of re-establishing oneself in one's own culture.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kukumana ndi chikhalidwe chatsopanokukhoza kukhala kovuta kwa anthu ati apaulendo?","The correct answer is **D: Apaulendo oleza mtima mochepa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anthu amene sizimawavuta kusintha chikhalidwe amakhalanso kuti nawo avutikaponso ndi chikhalidwe chawo."" This translates to ""People who don't find it easy to change habits also find it difficult with their own habits.""  This implies that people who are *less* patient (oleza mtima mochepa) will struggle more with adjusting to a new culture, and subsequently readjusting to their home culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention anything about a ""bad"" or ""frightening"" culture.
*   **B:** The passage implies it's *difficult* to adjust quickly, not that those who adjust quickly struggle.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention marital status.



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe anthu akuyenera kupewa kupanga ndi nyama yotchedwa mphalapala?,"Correct answer is **B: Kuyandikira pang'onopang'ono**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""anthu amayitenga ngati Mphalapala ndi nyama yosaopsa, amatha kuyiyandikira kwambiri kumene kuli kuziyika pa chiopsezo."" This directly means getting too close is something people should avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kusalabadira kupezeka kwao** - The passage doesn’t mention avoiding noticing them.
* **C: Kuchepetsa kuthekera kwawo kowopseza** - The passage emphasizes the moose *can* be dangerous if threatened, not that their potential for danger should be reduced.
* **D: Kuyang'ana kuchokera patali** - Observing from a distance is safe and doesn’t put anyone at risk.



"
"Malingana ndidimeyi, ndi mawu ati mwaawa omwe siolondola okhudza nyama yotchedwa Mphalapala?","The correct answer is **A: Ndi nyama zaukali pachilengedwe chake** (It is a fierce animal in nature).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the moose is generally not aggressive but will defend itself if threatened.** This directly contradicts the idea that it is inherently fierce.
* **B: Nthawi zina imatengedwa ngati sinyama yoopsa** (Sometimes it is considered a dangerous animal) - This is supported by the passage, as people *perceive* it as harmless, leading them to dangerous proximity.
* **C: Zimatha kuyambitsidwa ndi anthu amene aiyandikila kwambiri** (It can be provoked by people who get too close) - The passage says getting too close *puts people at risk*, implying the moose will react defensively.
* **D: Imadziteteza yokha pakafunikila** (It defends itself when necessary) - This is explicitly stated in the passage.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* supported by the information in the passage."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwaizi zomwe zikhoza kukhala chiopsezo cha munthu amene akuyenda m’chiplulu?","The correct answer is **A: Kusowa chovala chotenthetsa thupi usiku wozizira** (Not having warm clothes on a cold night).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Matenda a Hypothermia atha kukhala chiopsezo chenicheni ngati mulibe zovala zofundirako."" (Hypothermia can be a real danger if you don't have warm clothes.)

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: Kuwona chilubwelubwe chowonetsa madzi achinyengo** (Seeing mirages of water) - While described as potentially dangerous, it's the *following action* that's dangerous, not the mirage itself.
* **C: Kuononga mphavu pamene ukutsatila zilubwelubwe zooneka ngati madzi** (Wasting energy following mirages) - This is a consequence of the mirage, not the direct danger.
* **D: Kuononga madzi pamene ukutsatila zilubwelubwe zooneka ngati madzi** (Wasting water following mirages) -  Similar to C, this is a result of being misled, not the primary danger.



"
Ndiziti mwaizi zomwe sizinatchulidwe ngati chiopsezo chothekera cha anthu oyenda kuchipululu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kusowa kwa madzi** (Dehydration).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Chilubwelubwe** (Mirages) as a hazard.
    * **Matenda a Hypothermia** (Hypothermia) as a real threat.
* **The passage implies a risk of energy and water depletion** but doesn't directly state that dehydration is a specific danger.
* **Kupsa ndi dzuwa** (Sunstroke) is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, dehydration is the only option *not* mentioned as a potential hazard for travelers in the desert."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiwelengo cha gulu la anthu ati limene linakhudzika ndi kufika kwa ofufuza?","The correct answer is **C: Anthu achi Taínos**.

The passage explicitly states that the Taíno population ""declined sharply due to disease and exploitation by the Spanish"" after the arrival of European explorers. It even gives a specific estimate of the number of Taíno people killed by the Spanish.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anthu achi Haitians** - The passage mentions Haiti as sharing the island, but doesn't discuss its population being affected during this time.
*   **B: Anthu achi Caribes** - While the passage mentions the Caribes as early inhabitants, it focuses on the impact on the Taíno people.
*   **D: A Spanish** - The Spanish are identified as the exploiters, not the ones being negatively impacted.



"
"Malingana ndi 'ndimeyi, ndi chiyankhula chiti chimene chimayankhulidwa ndi ma Caribe?","The correct answer is **D: Chilankhulo cha Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""Ma Caribes ankalankhula Arawakan..."" which directly translates to ""The Caribs spoke Arawakan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chilankhulo cha Haitian** - Haitian Creole developed later, blending French and African languages.
*   **B: Chi Sipenishi** - Spanish was the language of the colonizers, not the original inhabitants.
*   **C: Chingerezi** - English is not mentioned in connection to the Caribs or early inhabitants.



"
Angapatsidwe udindo wotchukitsa masewera apa ayisi kuti akhale masewera osangalatsa ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bums**.

Here's why:

The text states that skiers, sometimes called ""ski bums,"" plan their entire vacations around skiing in different locations. This indicates they are passionate and dedicated to the sport, making them likely candidates to promote it as a fun activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Anthu aku Nolowe (Norwegian people):** While the text mentions a Norwegian club being founded in Australia, it doesn't say they would be responsible for promoting the sport.
*   **C: Anthu okhala kumphanga (People living in caves):** The text mentions cave paintings *depicting* skiing, but not that cave dwellers actively promote it.
*   **D: Anthu aku Ositeliya (Australian people):** The text mentions a club being founded in Australia, but doesn't imply they are the main promoters of the sport.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nthawi yanji imene masewera apa ayisi anadziwika ngati masewera anthu onse?","The correct answer is **C: Chaka cha 1861**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""muchaka cha 1861 kalabu linayambitsidwa ndi anthu aku Norway ku Australia."" (in 1861, a club was started by Norwegian people in Australia). This indicates that 1861 marks a significant step in the formalization and public recognition of skiing as a sport, with the formation of a club dedicated to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zaka zam’ma 1800:** While skiing existed before the 1800s, the passage doesn't say it became a widespread sport *during* the 1800s.
*   **B: Zikwi zisanu BC:** This refers to the earliest depictions of skiing, not when it was established as a popular sport.
*   **D: Zaka zam’ma 1700:** The passage mentions skiing downhill began in the 1700s, but doesn't say it became popular then."
Ndiziti mwazotsatirazi zomwe zimagwirizana ndi chilumba chachikulu ku m’mawa kwa magombe a africa?,"The correct answer is **D: Malo ogonamo apamwamba**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Madagasca kumbali ya nyama ndimbambane yili ngati kontinenti payokha. Zilumba zambiri zing'onozing'ono ndimayiko woyima pawokha, kulumikizana ndi dziko la France, ndipo amatchulidwa kuti **malo amagombe azisangalaro zapamwamba**.""

This directly links the large island (Madagascar and surrounding smaller islands) to being known as premium resort destinations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chikoka cha ku ulaya** - While European influence is mentioned, it's not specifically linked to the *island* itself, but to the sea route.
*   **B: Chipembedzo cha chisilamu** - This is associated with the Comoros and Mayotte islands, not the largest island mentioned.
*   **C: Nyama zakuthengo** - The text mentions Madagascar is *west of* Mozambique, not that it *has* wild animals.



"
Ndichani chime sichinali chifuniro cha zilumba zing'onozong'ono za ku m’mawa kwa africa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Mbiri ya nyama zakutchire**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zilumba zambiri zing'onozing'ono ndimayiko woyima pawokha, kulumikizana ndi dziko la France, ndipo amatchulidwa kuti malo amagombe azisangalaro zapamwamba."" This confirms options A and B *were* characteristics of the small islands.
* **The passage also states:** ""Madagasca kumbali ya nyama ndimbambane yili ngati kontinenti payokha."" This indicates Madagascar was like a separate continent, and wasn’t one of the small islands. Therefore, a history of wildlife wasn’t a characteristic *of the small islands*.
* **Option D** is incorrect because the passage explicitly states the islands *did* have a history of independence (""mayiko woyima pawokha"").



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi pasaka imasangalalidwa bwanji maka mwachikhadwe mumakachisi?","The correct answer is **B: Kukhala ndi chikhamu chochezera usiku wa loweluka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mipingo yambiri yachikhalidwe nthawi zambiri imakhala ndi Vigil ya Isitala tsiku loweluka usiku mkatikati mwa sabata la Isitala, pomwe anthu amumpingo nthawi zambiri amakonda kuchita zikondwelero pakati pa usiku kukondwelera kuuka kwa Khirisitu.""  This directly describes a vigil held on Holy Saturday night, with celebrations happening throughout the night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchita mwambo wa kubala** - The passage doesn't mention a ""mwambo wa kubala"" (birth ceremony).
*   **C: Kukhala ndi phwando la masika la mpingo wonse** - While celebrations happen, it's described as a vigil, not specifically a large feast.
*   **D: Kuyan'gana dzuwa likutuluka** - The passage *mentions* people being in good places to see the sunrise, but it doesn't say this *is* the celebration itself, it's a consequence of the night-long vigil.



"
"Pofuna kupewa zinthu zina zokuyeneraza kulowa dziko la Ecuador, mzika yaku Cuba imayenela kukhala ndi chani pachiyambi?","The correct answer is **B: Kalata yoitanidwa kulowa dzikolo yovomelezeka pamalamulo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ecuador imafuna kuti nzika zaku Cuba zizikhale ndi **kalata zosonyeza kuti zayitanidwa kuti zilowe mdzikolo** zisanalowe mu Ecuador..."" This is the primary requirement mentioned for Cuban citizens.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While a valid passport is necessary, the passage specifies a *letter of invitation* as the crucial initial document.
*   **C:** A return/onward ticket is required, but *after* the invitation letter requirement is met.
*   **D:** A US green card requires a separate process (visiting the Ecuadorian consulate) and doesn't replace the need for the invitation letter.

Kodi zoyeneleza kupita dziko la Ecuador sizinapangidwile chani?,"The correct answer is **B: kuonetsetsa kuti mayendedwe a anthu olowa ndikutuluka dziko akhale olongosoka.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the requirement for pre-authorization letters is ""kamba kofuna kuti mayendedwe olowa ndi kutuluka mdziko akhale olongosoka pakati pa mayiko awiri"" (established in order to ensure orderly entry and exit of people between the two countries). This is the primary reason for the new regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchepetsa chiwerengero cha anthu oyenda** - The passage doesn't mention any intention to *reduce* the number of travelers, only to regulate their entry.
*   **C: Kutsimikiza nthawi yokhalira ya munthu wapaulendo** - While the passage *does* mention verifying the duration of stay (through passport validity and return tickets), this is a *part* of ensuring orderly travel, not the overall goal.
*   **D: Kutsimikiza kuti chiphaso choyendera ndichoona** - Similar to C, checking passport validity is a detail within the larger goal of regulated travel.

Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zikhoza kukwera mtengo mudziko laini kusiyana ndi dziko lakwanu?,"The correct answer is **B: Maferemu apamwamba**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Maferemu apamwamba amayina otchuka amene akupezeka m'malo amenewa atha kukhala ndi mavuto awiri; ena atha kukhala ongofanana koma sienieni, ndipo amene adachokera kunja atha kukhala odula kusiyana ndiwomwe sakuchokera kunja."" This directly relates to the price difference of branded frames in different countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mayeso a maso (Eye tests):** The passage mentions getting your eyes tested at home, suggesting it's a routine thing you'd do locally, not necessarily a cost factor in another country.
*   **C: Inshuransi yamaso (Eye insurance):** While insurance costs *can* vary, the passage focuses on *using* your insurance, not the price of insurance itself as something that would differ drastically between countries.
*   **D: Maferemu osalemba maina olo kanthu (Non-branded frames):** The passage focuses on the price difference with *branded* frames.



"
Ndi chani chomwe chikhoza kukhala chiopsezo chogula maferemu apamwamba dziko laini?,"The most accurate answer is **B: Makhwala amene anakulembelani sangakhale oyenera pama feremu ena.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...makamaka pamene ngati insuransi ikukhuzaso zamaso, ndikuti zikasungidwe bwino lomwe penapake. Maferemu apamwamba amayina otchuka amene akupezeka m'malo amenewa atha kukhala ndi mavuto awiri; ena atha kukhala ongofanana koma sienieni, ndipo amene adachokera kunja atha kukhala odula kusiyana ndiwomwe sakuchokera kunja.""  This means different frames, especially those from outside the country, might not fit properly with the prescription lenses you have.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Mayeso owonjezera amaso akhoza kufunika** - While it's *possible* you'd need a new exam, the passage doesn't directly suggest that. It focuses on the fit of the frames *with* an existing prescription.
* **C: Akhoza kukhala achinyengo** - The passage mentions the possibility of imitations, but the primary concern is the *difference* in frames, not necessarily fraud.
* **D: Insulansi ikhoza osalipila mtengowo** - The passage mentions insurance coverage, but doesn't say it *won't* pay, only that you should keep the prescription safe for insurance purposes.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""On more remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currency is often accepted; it is best to ask the proprietor to find out which method of payment is permitted.""

This directly indicates that cash (British and US currency) would be more useful than credit cards on the more remote islands. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ku sitolo yakumadzulo ya FIC:** The passage mentions the bank near FIC West, but doesn't specifically say it's the best place to pay with cash.
*   **B: Konse ku zilumba:** While British pounds are widely accepted, the passage highlights cash being *especially* useful on remote islands where cards aren't guaranteed.
*   **D: Konse ku Stanley:** Credit cards and other currencies are readily accepted in Stanley.



"
Ndi chochitika chiti chimene chimayendelana ndi zikondwelero chapakachisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubadwa kwa timilungu**.

The passage states: ""Zikondwelero zokhudza mu kachisi zimakhala gawo lokondwelera chaka kapena **kubadwa kwa timilungu** kapena zikondwelero zina zokhudza tchalitchi."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubadwa ka njovu** - While the passage mentions decorated elephants in Kerala festivals, it doesn't link elephant births to the festivals themselves.
*   **B: Chikumbutso cha kachisi** - The passage mentions celebrating the year or religious events, not a memorial of the harvest itself.
*   **D: Zochitika zikuluzikulu zokhudza kachisi** - This is too broad. The passage specifically mentions celebrating the year or the birth of deities.



"
Kodi njobvu zokongoletsedwa zikhoza kuonedwa kuti?,"The correct answer is **D: M'msewu ya Kerala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maphwando amu kachisi wa Kerala ndiwopatsa chidwi kuonera, ndi mayendedwe anthawi zonse a njovu zokongoletsedwa..."" This directly links the decorated elephants to Kerala.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Paliponse kuyambira mapeto a mwezi wa Novembala kufikila pakati pa mwezi Meyi** - This states the *time* when festivals happen, not *where* the elephants are seen.
* **B: Mu makachisi** - While the elephants are part of temple festivals, this isn't specific enough. They are seen *during* the processions.
* **C: M’magulu a zikondwelero za kachisi** - This is a bit too general. It doesn't pinpoint the location.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi njira iti mwa izi yomwe ndi njira yotheka kupulumutsa ndalama pamene mwalipira ndege gawo la bizinesi kapena loyamba lapamwamba?","The correct answer is **D: Kuchotseledwa (Being bumped)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""palibe chifukwa chofunira kuti akutsitsire mtengo wa pamipando yandege yamtundu wa bizinezi kapena kalasi yoyamba pomwe ndegeyo siyoyima paliponse kupatula kuchokera ku A kupita ku B."" This implies that you shouldn't expect discounts on these higher classes *unless* something unusual happens, like being bumped from an overbooked flight.  The passage doesn't mention any of the other options as a way to save money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kugula zinthu kudzera kampani (Buying through a company):** The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **B: Kugula tikiti ya gawo loyamba mwalo mwa ya bizinesi (Buying a first class ticket instead of a business class ticket):** The passage explicitly states first class is *more* expensive, not a way to save money.
*   **C: Kugula tikiti ya gawo loyamba koma ya ulendo wosayenda chindunji (Buying a first class ticket but for a non-direct flight):** The passage doesn't mention this, and non-direct flights are often *more* expensive, not less.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chingakhale chotaitsa nthawi kufufuza ukamagula tikiti yotsikilako mtengo?","The correct answer is **A: Ndege zachindunji** (Direct flights).

The passage states, ""palibe chifukwa chofunira kuti akutsitsire mtengo wa pamipando yandege yamtundu wa bizinezi kapena kalasi yoyamba pomwe ndegeyo siyoyima paliponse kupatula kuchokera ku A kupita ku B."" This directly translates to ""there's no reason to expect discounts on business or first-class seats when the flight goes directly from A to B"".  

The passage implies that *direct* flights are less likely to have discounted fares in those premium classes because people willing to pay extra prioritize speed and convenience. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gawo labizinezi** (Business class) - The passage *discusses* business class but doesn't say it's what makes finding a cheap ticket difficult. It says business class is *expensive*.
* **C: Kuchotsera** (Discounts) - The passage talks about the *lack* of discounts on premium seats.
* **D: Gawo loyamba lapamwamba** (First class) - Similar to business class, the passage discusses the high cost of first class, but doesn’t say it makes finding cheaper tickets harder.

The passage specifically states: ""Musaiwale kuwonjezera ndalama zina zogwiritsa ntchito monga... zolipira mayendedwe apansi, ndizina zambiri kumalo onse akunja kwa Afirika."" This directly refers to the cost of onward travel *from* Africa when comparing a trip to Africa vs. a round-the-world trip.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While visa costs are mentioned, they aren't specifically about the difference between an Africa trip and a round-the-world trip. Visas would likely be needed for *both* types of trips.
*   **B:** Departure tax from Africa is mentioned, but is only one component, and isn't the primary focus of comparing the total costs.
*   **C:** Visa costs *to* Africa are relevant to the Africa trip itself, but don't help differentiate the total cost when comparing it to a round-the-world trip.

"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndi chani chimene masitolo akuluakulu akuyamba kupeleka mofuna kupeleka mwayi osankha zosiyansiyana","The correct answer is **A: Chakudya chophikilatu** (Pre-cooked food).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masitolo akuluakulu ochulukirachulukira akumakhala ndi gawo logulitsa zakudya zokonza kale."" This directly translates to ""Increasingly, large stores have a section selling pre-cooked food."" The passage highlights this as a growing trend in large stores to offer more options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mauvuni otenthetsera zakudya** (Microwave ovens/ways to heat food) - While some stores *offer* these, it's not what they are *starting to offer* as a new selection. They're a convenience *for* the pre-cooked food.
*   **C: Malo odyera chakudya pompo** (Food courts) - The passage notes food courts exist, but states they are not always permanent fixtures.
*   **D: Mitengo yofikilika** (Affordable prices) - The passage mentions affordability as a general benefit of shopping at large stores, but doesn't say they are *starting* to offer affordable prices - it's a characteristic of the store type.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ena akumapereka mpaka microwave kapena njira zina zotenthesera zakudya.""  This directly links the availability of heating methods (like microwaves/ovens) to making pre-cooked meals more appealing to customers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Malo odyera chakudya pompo** - While mentioned, the passage says these are often *not* permanent features and aren't a common offering in large stores.
* **B: Zosankha zochepa** - The passage implies the *opposite* - large stores have a growing section of pre-cooked foods.
* **C: Chakudya chosaphika** - The passage is about *pre-cooked* (already cooked) food, not uncooked food.

Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizingavetsetseke ndi anthu oyankhula chifalansa a mtundu wa chiBelgian ndi chiSwiss?,"The correct answer is **D: Anthu ambiri oyankhula chifalansa mu dziko la France**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Belgian and Swiss French speakers understand standard French (from France) *despite* differences in pronunciation and some vocabulary.  It specifically highlights differences in *their* way of counting and naming things. Therefore, the most logical thing they *wouldn't* easily understand is the way most French speakers in France do things – specifically, their standard numerical systems and common naming conventions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndondomeko yowelengera yokhazikika ya chifalansa (Standard counting system of French)** - The passage explicitly states they can understand even when numbers are used.
*   **B: Mawu a chifalansa achilendo (Foreign French words)** -  Foreign words are generally consistent across all French dialects.
*   **C: Matchulidwe a mawu ena muchifalansa (Naming of some words in French)** - The passage directly mentions differing word naming conventions as a characteristic difference.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sichimodzimodzi mu dziko France ngati m’mene zilili ku maiko a Belgium kapena Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndondomeko yowelengera** (The way of counting).

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Makamaka kumbali ya manambala kwa anthu olankhula chi Faransa aku Belgium ndiku Switzerland omwe mayakhulidwe ake amakhala ndi zina zosiyana kufananizira ndi chi Falansa chomwe chimayakhulidwa ku France..."" (Specifically regarding numbers, the way French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland pronounce them differs from how it's pronounced in France).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matchulidwe a mawu onse** (Pronunciation of all words) - While the passage mentions *some* different pronunciations, it doesn't say *all* words are pronounced differently.
* **C: Chiyankhulo cha chifalansa chokhazikika chomwe chimaphunzitsidwa m’masukulu** (Standard French language taught in schools) - The passage states that people in Belgium and Switzerland *learn* standard French in school, implying a common base.  The difference is in how they *pronounce* it, not what they are taught.
* **D: Kalembedwe ka mawu ena achifalansa** (Spelling of some French words) - The passage mentions different *names* for things, which implies different *words* used, not just spelling variations.



"
Ndi muzochitika ziti zimene sungapatsidwe mtengo wonyamulira maliro?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngati wakwera ndege ya kampani ya WestJet**.

Here's why:

The passage states WestJet *offers* reduced baggage fees. This implies they *can* charge baggage fees, and therefore you wouldn't automatically get a reduced rate just by flying with them. The other options involve airlines *that do* offer the reduced fees, or situations not related to fee waivers.



"
Ndichani chomwe chili cholondola chokhudza mitengo yamaliro?,"The correct answer is **A: Amalipira mtengo wonyamulira maliro**.

The passage explicitly states that airlines are offering baggage fees that *reduce* the final cost of last-minute fares. This means they are charging a fee for baggage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage doesn't mention needing to buy tickets *only* on the airline's website.
*   **C:** While the passage refers to a ""final minute"" fare, it doesn't say there's a fee for a ""last-minute travel fee"" in dollars. It's about the baggage fee reducing the overall cost.
*   **D:** While the passage suggests calling the airlines to confirm baggage allowances, it doesn't state tickets *must* be purchased by phone.

* **The passage states:** ""Ngati mulibe kulumikizana kwama intaneti pafoni yanu, kapena ikakhala kuti ili kutali ndi netiweki, magwiridwe ake antchito amakhala ochepa kapena ena samayipeza."" This directly indicates that standalone GPS maps (like those on a dedicated GPS device) are better when you don't have network connectivity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pamane ukuyesa ku pulumutsa ndalama:** While the passage mentions saving money, it doesn't say standalone maps are *best* when saving money, just that they can *help* save money.
* **B: Pamene mukutsimikiza kuti mukhala ndi kuthekera kolumikizana kudzera intaneti:** This is the opposite of when standalone maps are useful.
* **D: Pamene simukufuna kubwerekachipangizo:** This is another benefit mentioned, but not the primary reason to choose standalone maps.

Here's why:

The passage states that using phone GPS saves you from ""wasting money on current GPS maps, perhaps a GPS device itself or even borrowing one from a car rental company."" This directly relates to saving money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sizufunika kudandaula za kolumikizana kudzera intaneti** (No need to worry about internet connectivity) - The passage actually *points out* that phone GPS *requires* internet connectivity or will have limited functionality without it.
*   **C: Kupewa kulipira lendi** (Avoiding rental fees) - While mentioned, it's a specific example of saving money, not the overarching benefit.
*   **D: Sikofunika kugula mapu atsopano** (No need to buy new maps) - This is also an example of saving money, but again, the core benefit is the cost savings overall.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Onetsetsani kuti mkhala pakati amene adakuthandizani akhale katswiri wapa Galapagos ndiwodziwa bwino mitundu yochuluka ya sitima zam'madzi."" This directly recommends using a Galapagos expert to help you choose the right boat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions booking early to secure a spot, but doesn't specify a number of tickets.
*   **B:** While booking during the off-season might be cheaper, it doesn't guarantee the right boat for your needs.
*   **D:** Booking early is mentioned, but the *expertise* of the person helping you is highlighted as the key to finding a suitable boat.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zimene sizigwilitsidwa ntchito popangitsa alendo kupanga njuga?","The correct answer is **A: Kuchuluka ka kuwala mwachilengedwe** (The amount of natural light).

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on how casinos deliberately create an environment to keep people gambling. It mentions:
    *   Lack of windows and clocks (disorientation)
    *   Variety of food, drinks, and entertainment (distraction)
    *   Free alcoholic beverages (impairing judgment)
*   The amount of natural light is *not* mentioned as a tactic used by casinos in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zolimbikitsa ngati matikiti auelele a konaseti** (Incentives like concert tickets) - While not explicitly stated, the passage implies casinos use entertainment to keep people engaged.
*   **C: Zakumwa zaulele zolandilira alendo** (Free alcoholic beverages offered to guests) - This is directly mentioned as a tactic to impair judgment.
*   **D: Kusapezeka kwa mawotchi** (Lack of clocks) - This is also directly mentioned as a tactic to disorient guests and make them lose track of time.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chomwe osewera njuga ayenela kupewa?","The correct answer is **A: Kumwa mowa kwambiri**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that casinos offer free alcoholic beverages. It then directly links this to impaired thinking (""kuledzera kumalepheretsa kuganiza bwino"") and notes that informed people recognize the benefits of staying sober (""anthu onse odziwa juga amazindikira ubwino okhala osaledzera"").  This strongly suggests the passage warns against excessive alcohol consumption within the casino environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kulandila chilichonse cholimbikitsa:** While casinos are enticing, the passage doesn’t specifically warn against accepting incentives.
*   **C: Kuona nthawi kapena mawotchi:** The passage mentions the absence of clocks and watches as a tactic, but doesn’t suggest players should *avoid seeing* them if they were available.
*   **D: Kufufuza za njira yachidule yotulukira:** The passage notes exits are difficult, but doesn't advise against *looking* for them.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mau ati opezeka muchiganizo amene amatchulidwa pakati pa chiganizo?","The correct answer is **A: N’neni**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that ""everything, including the word 'Sie' which represents you, always begins with a capital letter, even when it appears within a sentence.""  'Sie' is being used to represent a person - a **n’neni** (noun referring to a person). The passage explains this capitalization rule is to differentiate *people* from other things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dzina** - 'Dzina' is a general term for 'noun' and doesn't specify *what kind* of noun is being discussed.
*   **C: Mfotokozi** - 'Mfotokozi' means 'adjective', and the passage is about nouns, not adjectives.
*   **D: Mphatikiram'buyo** - 'Mphatikiram'buyo' means 'pronoun', while 'Sie' is being used as a representative for a person, but the passage doesn't explicitly label it a pronoun. It focuses on it as a noun for a person.



"
"Malingana ndi'ndimeyi,ndichani chomwe chingapangitse kulemba zilembo zikuluzikulu kwa aneni kupangitse kukhala zovuta?","The correct answer is **C: Kulemba (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pamene kulemba ndikovuta kamba kofuna kudziwa kuti aneni kapena afotokozi agwiritsidwa ntchito m'njira yayikulu.""  This directly translates to ""...while writing is difficult because you need to know whether proper nouns or pronouns have been used in a capitalised way."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuwelenga (Reading):** The passage says capitalisation *helps* with reading, it doesn't make it difficult.
*   **B: kusiyanitsa pakati pa aneni (Distinguishing between pronouns):** The passage states the capitalisation *helps* to distinguish between pronouns and other things.
*   **D: Kusiyanitsa pakati pa zinthu (Distinguishing between things):**  Again, the passage says capitalisation helps with this distinction, not hinders it.



"
"M'madera akumidzi a Malaysia, ndi zizindikiro ziti zomwe zimasonyeza tabwerani kuno?","The correct answer is **A: Kupinda chala cholozera** (Inserting a small pin into the body).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that in rural Malaysia, the gesture resembling ""moni"" (a greeting) actually means ""come with me"" and involves ""kupinda chala kochepa kumapeto kakapindidwa kuloza thupi"" - inserting a small pin into the body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kubayibisa** - This is mentioned as the ""moni"" greeting, but not the rural Malaysian meaning.
*   **C: Kukweza chikhatho chankono moyang'anana** - This is a British person's action in Spain, unrelated to Malaysia.
*   **D: Kukweza chala chachikulu** -  The passage only mentions a *small* pin.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chizindikiro chiti chimene chingathandauze kuti tabwelerani?","The correct answer is **A: kubaibitsa dzanja lamanja likuyang'ana mkati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""M'maiko ambiri kubaibitsa ndi chizindikilo cha ubale kutanthauza “moni”. Ngakhale choncho, ku Malysia pafupifupi anthu a ku Malysia ambiri akumidzi, zimatathauza tabwerani chimodzimodzinso **ndikachala kochepa kumapeto kakapindidwa kuloza thupi**...""

This directly links the act of inserting a small nail into the body (which describes ""kubaibitsa dzanja lamanja likuyang'ana mkati"") to the meaning of ""tabwerani"" (come back).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kupinda chala cholozera:** While the passage mentions a nail, it doesn't say *entering* a nail is the signal. It's the *insertion* of a specific type of nail.
* **C: kubaibitsa chikhatho choyang'ana kunja:** The passage specifically describes a nail pointed *inward* (towards the body).
* **D: Kugwedeza mutu:** Head nodding isn't mentioned in the passage at all.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chimayambitsa mikwingwirima?","The correct answer is **B: Madzi owundana osakhazikika** (Unstable, saturated water).

Here's why:

The passage directly states that ""Madzi wogwirana sadakhazikike koma kutsetseleka mu phiri"" (Unstable, saturated water in the mountain) causes landslides (""kusweka"").  The rest of the description details *how* this unstable water contributes to the landslides, but the initial cause is the unstable water itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mlatho wa ayisi** (Tree roots) - While tree roots can *contribute* to slope stability, the passage doesn't identify them as the primary cause of landslides.
*   **C: Kugwa kwa mphanga za ayisi** (Falling tree branches) - This is a consequence of the landslide, not the cause.
*   **D: Midadada yosagwirana** (Uneven slopes) - Uneven slopes are a contributing factor, but the passage emphasizes the role of the water.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zimene zikhoza kubisidwa ndi mlatho wa ayisi","The correct answer is **A: Ming'alu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ming'alu itha kutsekeka."" (Ming'alu can become blocked). This directly indicates that mlatho wa ayisi (tree roots) could be the cause of blockage for ming'alu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mphanga za ayisi (Tree trunks)**: The passage doesn't mention tree trunks being covered by the mudflow.
*   **C: Zipupa (Rocks)**: While rocks can be affected by the mudflow, the passage doesn't say they get *covered* by it.
*   **D: Midadada ikuluikulu (Large hills)**: The passage discusses effects *on* the land, not covering hills.



"
"Malingana ndi dimeyi, apaulendo akuyenera kutenga njira iti yowonjezera asanakaonene madera ati?","The correct answer is **B: Madera ozungulira Goma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngakhale ku Goma mkasaopsa, mukamapita kunja kwa Goma mudzifunsa kaye kuti mumve ngati zomenyana zikupitilira kumpoto kwa chigawo cha Kivu."" This directly translates to ""Even though it's dangerous in Goma, before going outside of Goma you should first find out if fighting is continuing to the north of the Kivu region.""

Therefore, before venturing *outside* Goma, travelers need to check on the security situation in the surrounding areas. The other options are not directly mentioned as needing a security check before visiting.



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizingakhale zabwino kwa alendo okawona Goma?,"Correct answer is **A: Kumenyana kwa kumpoto ka Kivu ndikosangalatsa**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states you should *ask if fighting is continuing* before going outside of Goma, implying it's a dangerous and *not* enjoyable situation. The other options are all positive aspects mentioned in the text:

*   **B:** Goma is a base for gorilla trekking.
*   **C:** Boda-bodas are a good way to get around.
*   **D:** Goma was affected by the Nyiragongo volcano.



"
Ndiliti limene chilolezo chokhalira choyamba mwezi wa ogasiti chingapezeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsiku loyamba la mwez wa Epulo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that permits become available four months before the start date of the month you want to hike. Since the permit for May 1st is highly sought after and fills up immediately, and the permits are released four months prior, the permits for May become available on January 1st. Therefore, the permits for August would become available on April 1st."
Ndi ndondomeko yanji yomwe ilipo yoteteza ma golodi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndondomeko yopelekera chilolezo ya woyamba kubwera ndiye woyamba kuthandizidwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...Pamakhala zilolezo zochepa zomwe zimasungiridwa kwa ongobwera kudzafunsa potengera kuti woyamba kufika, ndi amene amayambirira kuthandizidwa."" This directly describes a first-come, first-served system for a limited number of permits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says permits are available four months before the start date, starting in May, not January.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't mention permits being taken *at* offices, only that there are limited permits available.
*   **D:** While there are a *limited* number of permits, ""chiwerengero za zilolezo zochepa"" isn't the *policy* for distributing them. The policy is first-come, first-served for those remaining.

Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi chomwe chili ndikuthekera kochepa kopezeka munyumba zogonamo zomwe zakambidwa mu m'ndimeyi?,"The correct answer is **D: Zipinda zogonamo zokonzedwa mwatsopano ndi zamakono**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically describes these hotels as having a ""vintage character,"" with ""old-fashioned clothing,"" a ""lack of modern amenities,"" and a ""beautiful antiquity."" This strongly suggests they *wouldn't* have modern, renovated rooms.

Let's look at why the other options are more likely:

*   **A: Malo omwera ochezera choimilira** - The passage mentions good dining and nightlife, making a bar a reasonable possibility.
*   **B: Malo ogulitsa ndi odyera chakudya pompo otchedwa gourmet** -  ""Good dining"" implies a quality food experience, even if not explicitly ""gourmet.""
*   **C: Alendo anzanga omwe ndiodziwika kapena odziwika bwino** - The text states these hotels hosted ""disabled and famous people"" and occasionally ""state leaders and other dignitaries.""



"
"Kutengera ndi zimene za fotokozeledwa m’ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe alendo akunyumba yogona alendo angaiike kumapeto?","The correct answer is **C: Malo opumirapo ochezelera usiku** (Comfortable evening entertainment).

Here's why:

The passage states the hotels were known for ""good evening entertainment"" and were places where ""celebrities"" and ""important people"" would frequent. This indicates a focus on providing a sophisticated and enjoyable nightlife experience for their guests.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Zokongoletsera zakale pamaloponse** (Antique decorations in public areas) - While the passage mentions a ""beautiful old atmosphere,"" it doesn't specifically highlight decorations as a primary feature guests would *seek out*.
*   **B: Malo odyela okhalandi ophika wodziwika** (Restaurants with a known chef) - The passage mentions ""good dining rooms,"" but doesn't emphasize celebrity chefs.
*   **D: Mitengo zazipinda zogonamo yofikilika** (Affordable room rates) - The passage implies these were luxury hotels frequented by the wealthy (""travelers with a lot of money"") so affordability isn't a key characteristic. The passage also states people would travel the world to stay there, implying it wasn’t cheap.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndi ziti zimene anthu amene akukaona ku Greenland akuyenera kupewa?","The correct answer is **D: Kuyerekeza ndi mbadwa ya ku Greenland ngati “Eskimo”**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Pamene mukumva mawuwa [Esikimo] akugwiritsidwa ntchito ndi mbadwa zaku Greenland, magwiritsidwe ake a ntchito ayenera kupewedwa ndi anthu ochokera kunja kwadzikolo."" It emphasizes that Greenlanders prefer to be called Inuit or Kalaallit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text states that upandu ndi nkhanza sizidziwika ku Greenland (crime and violence are unknown).
*   **B:** The text mentions issues with sleeplessness due to long daylight hours, not returning clothes.
*   **C:** While the text notes internet availability, it doesn't suggest avoiding expectations regarding its function.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zikhoza kukhala vuto la anthu apaulendo omwe sanakonzekele kuyenda ku Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Nyengo (Weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nyengo yozizira ndiye chiopsezo chenicheni chomwe chimapeza osakonzekera. Ngati mukupita ku Greenland nthawi yozizira... ndikoyenera kutenga zovala zotenthera zokwanira."" This directly identifies the weather, particularly the cold, as a real hazard for unprepared travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Udzudzu wa nordic:** The passage mentions Nordic udzudzu but says it ""doesn't cause disease, but disturbs peace,"" which is an inconvenience, not a major danger for unprepared travelers.
*   **B: Kulakwila lamulo:** The passage explicitly states ""Upandu ndi nkhanza , kwa obwera sizidziwika ku Greenland,"" meaning crime and hostility towards visitors are unknown.
*   **D: Anthu amudelaro:** The passage also states that hostility towards visitors is unknown.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsailazi zomwe zikugwiritsidwa ntchito ku central plaza,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states ""Jardín de la Unión...está como plaza central, y muchas cosas suceden, por la mañana y por la tarde."" (Jardín de la Unión...functions as the central plaza, and many things happen, in the morning and afternoon).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mtsinje wa chipsopsono wa Alley** (Stream of the Alley of Kiss) - While Callejon del Beso is mentioned, it's described *within* the central plaza, not as the plaza itself.
* **C: Kachisi wa de San Diego** (Temple of San Diego) - The text states the Temple *was* part of a 17th-century house, but doesn't indicate it's the central plaza.
* **D: Callejon del Beso** (Alley of the Kiss) - This is a location *within* the central plaza area, a specific alley, not the plaza itself.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizipezeka ku malo a Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **D: Nyumba yakale yamasisitere**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Jardín de la Unión was originally the atrium of a 17th-century house, *Templo de Sa Diego*, and is the *only* house remaining. It doesn't mention any other old mansions.
* **The passage *does* mention:**
    * **A: Gazebo yapakati ndi ma konseti:** ""Zoyimbayimba zaulere zomwe zimachitikira pakati pa gazebo.""
    * **B: Nyumba ya chikondi chapadzana:** ""Callejon del Beso (Alley of the kiss)...malo akalekale achikondi.""
    * **C: Malo ogulitsa ndikudyera chakudya oyang'anizana ndi dimba:** ""Pali malo ambiri odyera ozungulira mundawo...""

Therefore, an old mansion is not mentioned in the text."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zimene sizolondola zokhudza masewera a hiking oyenda mitunda italiitali?","Correct answer is **D: Masewera oyenda atsiku limodzi siwoyenera kwa mabanja omwe ali ndi ana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mabanja omwe ali ndi ana achichepere atha kufuna kukonzekera kwambiri, koma kutuluka kunja patsikulo nkotheka mosavutikira ngakhale ndi makanda omwe ndi ana osayamba sukulu."" This directly contradicts option D, which claims hiking is *not* suitable for families with children.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A:** The passage says ""Kuyenda kwatsiku limodzi mu njila yosavuta kumafuna kukonzekela pang'ono"" (Hiking a simple trail for a day requires some preparation).
*   **B:** The passage defines hiking as ""mitunda italiitali yomwe itha kuyendedwa pa tsiku limodzi"" (longer distances that can be hiked in a day).
*   **C:** The passage states ""ndi munthu aliyese wankhongono angathe kukwanitsa"" (anyone with reasonable fitness can achieve it). This implies people of average fitness can enjoy it.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nthawi iti imene masewera oyenda mitunda itali itali imafunikila chikonzero chochepa?","The correct answer is **B: Pamene akukayenda njira yosavuta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuyenda kwatsiku limodzi mu njila yosavuta kumafuna kukonzekela pang'ono, komanso ndikofunika, ndipo munthu aliyese wankhongono angathe kukwanitsa."" This directly translates to ""A day hike on an easy trail requires little preparation, and is achievable by anyone reasonably fit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pamene okayendayo ali wathanzi** - While fitness helps, the passage specifically highlights the *trail difficulty* as the factor reducing preparation needed.
*   **C: Pamene ana akupita kukapanga nawo masewera oyenda m’mitunda italiitali** - The passage actually says families with young children need *more* preparation.
*   **D: Pamene masewera okayendawo ali m’maloachilengedwe** - The location (natural areas) is a general characteristic of hiking, but doesn't determine the level of preparation needed.



"
Kodi kusiyana ka zikweza za Rogaland kapena Agder mosiyanitsa ndi ku Norway konse ndichani?,"The correct answer is **D: They are often covered in heather**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ku Rogaland ndi Agder amatchedwa kuti “hei” kutanthauza kuti moorland wopanda mtengo nthawi zambiri imakhala yokutilidwa mochititsa kaso."" This translates to: ""In Rogaland and Agder they are called “hei” meaning moorland without trees, often covered in heather.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ali ndi mitengo (They have trees):** The passage explicitly states these areas are *without* trees.
* **B: Palibe pompho (No moss):** The passage doesn't mention moss.
* **C: Zikweza zake ndizofanana (The moors are the same):** The passage distinguishes between ""vidde"" (in general Norway) and ""hei"" (specifically Rogaland and Agder).



"

Ndi nthawi iti yomwe alendo omwe ali ndi chidwi cha masewera a Skii angakaendele malo okwelera mapiri?,"The correct answer is **A: M'nyengo yozizira**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that during the cold season, mountains have soft snow and you can enjoy skiing and snowballing. This directly answers the question about the best time for skiing enthusiasts.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nyengo iti imene alendo amakhala ochuluka ku malo a Hill","The correct answer is **C: M'nyengo yachilimwe ya ku India**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nthawi ya alendo yopita ku kokwelera sitima zapamtunda kumapiri imafika pachimake nthawi yotentha yaku India."" This directly translates to ""The peak season for tourists going to mountain railways is during the hot season in India (summer).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panthawi imene ayisi akugwa kwambiri** - The passage mentions snow in winter, but doesn't say this is *peak* season.
*   **B: M'nyengo yonse ya masewera a chisanu** - This doesn't relate to the passage.
*   **D: M'nyengo yonse yozizira** - While winter offers activities like skiing, the passage says the *peak* season is during the hot weather.



"
Ndi chani chimene mukuyenera kupewa ngati mukukhulupilira kuti mupeza bwato lomwe likufuna chithandizo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutsatsa malonda ako (Advertising your services)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes building relationships and getting to know people in the marinas through genuine interaction – offering help, asking questions, and learning from others.  **Advertising your services** (kutsatsa malonda ako) is a direct, sales-oriented approach that goes *against* the spirit of organically building trust and being recognized as someone helpful and reliable.  The passage suggests people will *offer* you opportunities, not that you should solicit them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuyenda mokwera ndi kutsika doko (Walking up and down the dock):** This is a natural part of being present and meeting people.
*   **B: Kukhala bwenzi lawoyang'anira bwato (Being friendly with the dockmaster):** Building rapport with the dockmaster is a good strategy, as they are key people in the marina.
*   **D: Kusalabadila azako ochita masewera okwera bwato (Ignoring fellow boaters):** The passage specifically encourages *talking* to many people.



"
Ndichani chimene uyenera kupanga pakati pa a marinas pamene ukufufuza bwato limene likufuna chithandizo,"The correct answer is **C: Muwafikile anthu pamene akusamala mabwato awo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""...kuyesera kupeza woyendetsa sitima zam'madzi omwe ali m'malo omwera mowa, ndi zina zotero...kufunsa anthu omwe akusamala maboti awo..."" This directly advises approaching people caring for boats as a way to gather information and potentially find a boat needing work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lumikizanani ndi Amalinyero (Connect with Sailors):** While connecting with sailors is mentioned generally, the passage specifically highlights talking to boat owners/caretakers.
* **B: Kukhala malo amene pali radar (Being in a place with radar):** Radar isn't relevant to *finding* a boat needing assistance.
* **D: Kupewa anzako oyendayenda ofuna mayendedwe (Avoiding fellow travelers seeking rides):** The passage encourages *talking* to fellow travelers, not avoiding them.



"
Ndi malo ati amene angatenge mtima alendo kuti akaone chilumba cha mbiri yachitsamunda?,"The correct answer is **A: Dela la Kumpoto mphepete mwa nyanja**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zitukuko zikuluzikulu zambiri zam'mizinda ku chilumba cha Hong Kong ndizozaza pamalo omwe adali madzi mphepete mwa nyanja kumpoto. Awa ndi malo amene atsamunda ochokera ku Britain adatenga kuti ndi awo choncho ngati mukufuna umboni wake wachitsamunda, malo abwino kuyambalipo ndi amenewa.""

This directly points to the northern waterfront of Hong Kong Island as the location for colonial historical sites.
"
Ndi malo ati amene angatenge mtima alendo omwe amaika patsogolo maonekedwe odabwitsa?,"The correct answer is **B: Dela la Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dera la Hong Kong lidatenga dzina lake kuchokera ku chilumba cha Hong Kong ndipo ndi malo omwe alendo ambiri amayika mtima wawo."" This directly indicates that Hong Kong Island is the place that captures the hearts of many visitors. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Doko la Victoria:** While Victoria Harbour *contributes* to the beautiful skyline, it's the location, not the place that captures hearts.
*   **C: Chilumba cha Hong Kong:** The passage specifically refers to ""Dera la Hong Kong"" (Hong Kong Island) as the place that captures hearts.
*   **D: Dela la Kowloon Kutsogolo kwa nyanja:** Kowloon is mentioned as a good vantage point *to view* Hong Kong, but not as a place that captures hearts itself.



"
Kodi zishalo zina zili ndi chani chimene chimathandizila kuti woyendetsa asadwetse phazi lake muzotchingira zampando wapahachi?,"The correct answer is **C: zampando wapahachi wokhala ndi chikopa**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Zotsatira zake, zishalo zina, makamaka zishalo zakwa angelezi, zimakhala ndi zotchingira zomwe zimalola chikopa kugwera pachishalo ngati chikukokedwa kumbuyo ndi okwera amene akugwa."" This directly indicates that some saddles have releases that allow the stirrup to come loose if the rider's foot gets caught, preventing them from being dragged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: chopapatizila miyendo chaching'ono:** The passage doesn't mention anything about small foot rests.
*   **B: Mipingidzo yachitetezo:** While safety is discussed, the passage specifies a mechanism in the stirrup itself, not a general safety feature.
*   **D: Kukhazikika kwakukulu:** Stirrups *provide* stability, but this isn't what prevents a rider from being dragged. The release mechanism is the key feature described in relation to the safety concern.



"
Ndimajombo opangidwa ndi zizindikiro ziti omwe munthu wokwera hachi amavala zomwe zimalimbikitsa chitetezo chawokwera,"The correct answer is **C: Chidendene**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Poyamba, okwera ambiri amavala jombo zoyendetsera zokhala ndi **chidendeni** ndi yosalala, yosongoka, yochepa chapansi."" This directly links the use of a stirrup to safety for riders.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chopapatizira miyendo chokhakhala:** The passage doesn't mention tight-fitting leg wraps in relation to safety.
*   **B: Chikopa:** While the passage mentions a safety feature *related* to the stirrup allowing the boot to come free, the stirrup itself is not a boot.
*   **D: Chopapatizila miyendo chachikulu:** Similar to A, there's no mention of large leg wraps and safety in the text.



"
Ndi chani chimene chimapelekedwa kwa alendo kudzera m'malo ochezela alendo,"The correct answer is **A: Malo ogona okhala ndi ocheleza amderalo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the organization connects travelers with locals who can offer lodging. It mentions Casey Fenton needing a place to stay in Iceland and receiving offers of free accommodation from students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndge zotsika mtengo** - While the passage mentions Casey Fenton *found* a cheap flight, the organization itself doesn't provide them.
*   **C: Alendo amapatsidwa otsogolera am'delaro** - The passage doesn't mention tour guides.
*   **D: Kulumikizana ndi apaulendo ena okayendera malo ofanana** - While connection is part of the network, the primary offering is accommodation, not just networking."
"Kutengera ndi m'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zokhudza m'malo ochezela alendo chomwe sichoona?","Choyenera choyenera ndichotsatira: **A: Apaulendo nthawi zonse amapatsidwa maina a anthu ocheleza amderalo**

"Malingana ndi mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi mtundu wa alendo ato omwe sizingatheke kupezeka mu malo agulu?","The correct answer is **C: Alendo oyenda ndi ana ang'onoang'ono**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ndizosowa kuti uwone mabanja omwe ali ndi ana"" which translates to ""It is rare to see families with children"". This directly indicates that families with children are *not* commonly found at this place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alendo omwe zaka zawo ndizoyambira makumi awiri (Guests whose age starts from twenties):** The passage mentions young groups, but doesn't exclude people in their twenties.
*   **B: Alendo oyenda okhaokha (Solo travelers):** The passage doesn't mention anything about whether people travel alone or not.
*   **D: Alendo omwe zaka zawo ziri pakatikati pa makumi awiri (Guests whose age is in the middle of twenties):** The passage mentions some older people visit sometimes, suggesting people in their twenties aren't excluded.



"
"Kutengera zimene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ndani amene alindikuthekera kokakhala kumalo agulu?","The correct answer is **A: Banja limene layenda ndi mwana wakhanda** (A family traveling with a young child).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndizosowa kuti uwone mabanja omwe ali ndi ana, koma malo ogona chigulu amalola kuti akhale muzipinda zawozawo."" (It's rare to see families with children, but group accommodations allow them to stay in their own rooms.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Anthu atatu azaka zakubadwa zokwanira makumi awiri andi mphambu ziwiri** (Three people aged 22) - While the passage mentions young adults (around 12 years old), it doesn't specifically say *only* people of this age can stay.
* **C: Banja limene lili muzaka za makumi asanu ndi awiri** (A family in their 50s) - The passage mentions older adults sometimes being present, but doesn't restrict accommodation to this age group.
* **D: Mabanja awiri omwe akuyenda ndi ana awo** (Two families traveling with their children) - The passage says it's *rare* to see families with children, not that two families are allowed.



"
"Malingana ndi mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi mawu ati mwaotsatilawa amene akufotokoza molondola zoponya boomerang?","The correct answer is **D: Maboomerang ena amatha kubwerera**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ma boomerang ambiri omwe alipo ku Australia kwenikweni ndi osabwerera m'mbuyo."" (Many of the boomerangs available in Australia are actually non-returning.) This directly implies that *some* boomerangs *can* return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nthawi zonse kamabwelera mmanja mwako ngati kaponyedwa bwino** - The passage suggests the opposite - not all boomerangs return.
*   **B: Ndizodziwika kwambiri pakati pa anthu m'mudelaro kusiyana ndi alendo** - The passage doesn't discuss who uses boomerangs more.
*   **C: Simaboomerang ambiri amene amapezeka mu dziko la Australia** - While true according to the passage, this doesn't *define* what boomerang throwing is; it just states a fact about availability.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zimagwiritsidwa ntchito kwambiri mu zakudya za chiJavanese,"The correct answer is **C: Shuga wa kokonati**.

The passage specifically states that Java cuisine uses ""makamaka sugar wa kokonati waku java"" (specifically coconut sugar from Java). This directly identifies coconut sugar as a key ingredient. The other options are not mentioned."
"Monga mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, matenda opatsilana amafalikira bwanji?","The correct answer is **B: Tzilombo toyambitsa matenda** (Germs that cause disease).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matenda opatsirana ndi amene amayamba chifukwa cha tizilombo, ngati ma vayilasi, bakiteliya, fangasi kapena ena ma parazayiti."" This directly translates to ""Communicable diseases are those that start because of germs, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Athu odwala** (Sick people) - While sick people *carry* the diseases, they aren't *how* they spread.
*   **C: Kachilombo kofalitsa matenda kotchedwa bakiteliya** (A germ that spreads disease called bacteria) - Bacteria are *a type* of germ, but the passage lists many types of germs, not just bacteria.
*   **D: Makatemera** (Vaccines) - Vaccines *prevent* diseases, they don't *spread* them.



"
"Monga mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, Ndi chani chomwe sichikudziwika kuti chimayambitsa matenda opatsilana?","The correct answer is **A: Makatemera (Vaccines)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by organisms like viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. It *doesn't* mention vaccines as a cause of infectious diseases. In fact, vaccines are used to *prevent* infectious diseases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kachilombo kofalitsa matenda kotchedwa vayilasi (Virus):** The passage specifically lists viruses as a cause of infectious diseases.
*   **C: Kachilombo kofalitsa matenda kotchedwa bakiteliya (Bacteria):** The passage specifically lists bacteria as a cause of infectious diseases.
*   **D: Kachilombo kofalitsa matenda kotchedwa fangasi (Fungi):** The passage specifically lists fungi as a cause of infectious diseases.

Ndimuzochitika ziti zimene kusankha wokulowerani mmalo mwanu pa intaneti kusiyanitsa ndi kukhala ndi netiweki yachinsinsi yawekha ya VPN kungakhale kokwanira?,"The correct answer is **B: Wogwiritsa ntchito amakhudzidwa ndi kupewa kufufuzidwa ndi ukazitape mmene angathele**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights VPNs as a way to avoid surveillance and make it difficult for trackers.**  A proxy server can hide your IP address, but a VPN provides *encryption* as well, making your data unreadable. If the primary concern is strong privacy and avoiding tracking, a VPN is superior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wogwiritsa ntchito amafuna kusintha njira zonse zodutsira mauthenga** - Both VPNs and proxies change your routing, so this isn't a distinguishing factor.
* **C: Wogwiritsa ntchito amapatutsira zochitika pa http** -  Both VPNs and proxies work with HTTP (and other protocols). The type of traffic isn't the key difference.
* **D: Zochitazawogwiritsa ntchito zimafunika mulingo wapakatikati mpaka wapamwamba pa mphavu ya intaneti** - While VPNs *can* offer faster speeds, this isn't always the case, and isn't the main reason to choose one over a proxy.



"
"Monga mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi,ndimawu ati mwaotsatilawa okhudza netiweki yachinsinsi yawekha ya VPN ndi yokhala ndiwokulowera mmalo mwako pa intaneti omwe siolondola?","The correct answer is **A: netiweki yachinsinsi yawekha ya VPN imapeleka mphavu yokwera ya intaneti kusiyana ndi kukhala ndi wokulowera mmalo mwako pa intaneti**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nthawi zambiri amapereka mphamvu yothamanga yambiri ndiposo ntchito yapamwamba"" (They often offer faster speeds and better performance) when referring to VPNs. This directly supports option A.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** The passage says VPNs make it *harder* for trackers, not that proxies don't transmit data at all.
    * **C:** The passage doesn't make a comparison about how proxies function in relation to VPNs.
    * **D:** The passage explicitly states that VPNs send messages through *many* methods, *not just* HTTP (""Amatumiza mauthenga apa intaneti munjira zambiri, osati http yokha."").



"
Chimaloleza munthu wina kugwiritsa ntchito foni ya kampani pamene atuluka mmalo ogwililako ntchito?,"The correct answer is **A: Mafoni oyendetsedwa pa intaneti** (Internet-based phone systems).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that with internet-based phone systems (""Kamba kakuti mafoni amayendetsedwa pa intaneti""), you don't need to use a phone company based on your location.  You can even get a number that makes it *appear* you're in a different location while physically being elsewhere. This directly addresses the question of using a company phone while traveling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manambala afoni adziko lonse lapansi** (Worldwide phone numbers) - While mentioned in the passage, they are a *result* of using internet-based phones, not the system that *allows* you to use the phone remotely.
* **C: Masatelayiti** (Satellites) - Satellites are a method of *getting* internet access, particularly in remote areas, but not the phone system itself.
* **D: Mafoni a PSTN** (PSTN phones) - The passage contrasts internet phones *with* traditional PSTN phones, stating that PSTN phones *require* a local phone company.

"Monga mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndichani chimene chikuyeneleka kupangidwa kuti muthu alandile mafoni ena","The correct answer is **A: Kugula manambala afoni adziko lonse lapansi (Purchasing a toll-free number)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kawirikawiri mukufunika kuti mugule nambala yogwira dziko lonse mwapadera imene sikana mafoni a PSTN akakuyimbirani."" (Often you need to purchase a separate toll-free number so that PSTN phones can call you). This is the key requirement mentioned for having a phone number that isn't tied to your physical location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kugwiritsa ntchito kampani yafoni ya m'mdera lako (Using a local phone company)** - The passage actually suggests *avoiding* this, as the point is to not be limited by location.
* **C: Kupeza nambala kuchokera ku dera lako (Getting a number from your area)** -  This is the opposite of what the passage advises when using internet-based phones.
* **D: Kugula foni ya PSTN (Buying a PSTN phone)** - PSTN phones are what the passage suggests you *don't* need to rely on to receive calls with this setup.

Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizikufotokoza molondola za matchulidwe a mawu a chiyankhulo cha Italian?,"The correct answer is **A: r muwiri amatchulidwa mosoyana ndi r mmodzi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that 'r' and 'rr' are pronounced differently (caro vs. carro). Option A incorrectly states they are pronounced the same.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Mawu ambiri amatchulidwa mmene alembedwela** - The passage starts by saying this is generally true (""Kutchula mau a chi Taliyana nkophweka chifukwa mau amatchulidwa monga m'mene alembedwela"").
* **C: Mawu amene ali ndi lembo c ndi g akhoza kukhala ovuta** - The passage highlights that 'c' and 'g' pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
* **D: Matchulidwe a mawu ambiri amasiyana kutengera ndi mavawelo otsatilawa** - This is directly stated about 'c' and 'g'.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Misewu ikuluikulu yotakasuka, **nyumba zamagalasi kutsogolo** komaso malo amakono azamalonda zoziwika ndimadenga achikalekale amatayilosi ofiira..."" This directly indicates that glass-fronted houses are a modern feature of Izmir.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndomo yaikulu:** The passage says Izmir is *surrounded* by a large bay, but the bay itself is a natural feature, not something created recently.
*   **C: Malo azamalonda:** The passage describes them as ""modern shopping areas,"" but doesn't specify they are *new* to the city. Trade has likely always been part of Izmir's character.
*   **D: Madenga okhala ndi matailosi ofiira:** The passage specifically calls these ""old tiled roofs,"" indicating they are a historical element.

Mawu oti hanami amasonyeza kuona kwa chani?,"The correct answer is **A: Maluwa atcheri**.

The passage states, ""Kuwona maluwa a cherry, kodziwika kuti hanami..."" which directly translates to ""Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami..."" Therefore, hanami represents the viewing of cherry blossoms."
Ndi ndani amene anapngitsa chikondwelero choyamba chosangala powona maluwa achipatso cha atcheri,"The correct answer is **C: Mfumu ya dziko la Japan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ku Japan, ma phwando oyamba a maluwa a cherry inkadzipangira yokha mfumu yaikulu komanso anthu ena akuchifumuko ku bwalo la chifumu."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held exclusively by the imperial court and high-ranking nobles at the imperial court."" 

Therefore, the first celebrations were for the Emperor of Japan and those close to the royal court.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Wild Card ""allows entry to several game reserves in South Africa or all the South Africa National Parks."" This means it benefits anyone planning to visit *multiple* parks, including Kruger National Park *and* others.
* Option A is too broad - it mentions SANParks generally, but the Wild Card’s value is in visiting multiple parks.
* Option B is too specific – it only mentions Kruger. The Wild Card is beneficial if visiting more than just Kruger.
* Option C is about financial planning, not who benefits from the card itself.



"
Ndi mawu ati amene sakufotokoza molondola zamalo osungilako nyama zakutchire otchedwa Kruger Nationanal Park,"The correct answer is **A: Kumatengedwa ngati ndiye gawo lenileni lozakopa alendo ku South African kapena m'mwera wa Afilika.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states Kruger National Park is *one of* the major tourist attractions in South Africa.** It doesn't claim it's *the only* or *the definitive* one. Saying it *is* the definitive attraction is an exaggeration and not supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B:** The passage explicitly says the park is divided into 14 ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
* **C:**  While the passage doesn't state its *size* relative to all other parks, it clearly describes it as a large and important park (19,500 km²).
* **D:** The passage directly mentions the Wild Card and entry fees.



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zili ndi kuthekera kodzetsa chiopsezo kwa okwerawa mmadera onse otsetseleka amphirilo?,"Correct answer: **A: Nyengo zonyowa**

**Explanation:**

The passage specifically states: ""...*yembekezerani kuti mubanika, ndipo samalani magawo otsetseleka makamaka kukanyowa poti kumakhala koopsya.*"" This directly links wet conditions (rain) to the danger on the steep sections of the trail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mopondera/masitepe ma miyala:** While the steps are old and can be challenging, the passage doesn't imply they *cause* danger, but rather are a part of the climb.
*   **C: Mphanga zing'onozing'ono:** The passage mentions a *single* deep chasm, not multiple small ones, and focuses on the difficulty of that specific chasm.
*   **D: Zingwe zachitsulo:** The steel cables *assist* climbers and provide support; they aren’t a hazard themselves.

Ndi ziti mwamawu otsatilawa omwe sakufotokoza molondola za chitunda cha phiri la Machu Picchu zomwe zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kulibe zingwe/zogwirila zachitsulo konse kotsetseleka.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states:** ""malo wotsetsereka kwambiri muli zingwe zazitsulo zomwe anthu amazigwira pothandizira kupereka mphamvu zoti asagwe."" (The steepest parts have steel cables people hold onto for support.) This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate descriptions based on the text:

*   **A: Ngakhale athu amatupi amphavu okwera phiri akhoza kumalephera kupuma:** The passage states it takes fit people 45 minutes to climb, implying it's challenging even for those in good shape.
*   **C: Ukuyenera kudutsa kudzera pamwamba pa mphanga:** The passage mentions a ""kaphanga kamene kayenera kudutsidwa"" (a gorge that must be crossed).
*   **D: Malo otsetseleka amakhala owopsya pamene anyowa:** The passage warns, ""samalani magawo otsetseleka makamaka kukanyowa poti kumakhala koopsya."" (be careful of the steep sections, especially when wet, as they are dangerous.)

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi,ndichani mwaizi chomwe chisali chodalilika mu chakudya cha Majprcan?","The correct answer is **C: chimanga**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Marjocan cuisine as including bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil. It *specifically* mentions **Pa amb Oli**, which is described as bread with olive oil, tomato, and other additions. It does *not* mention potatoes (chimanga) at all.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyama (Meat)** - The passage explicitly states meat, particularly pork, is a part of Marjocan cuisine.
*   **B: Nkate (Bread)** - Bread is a key component, as evidenced by the description of Pa amb Oli.
*   **D: Masamba (Vegetables)** - Vegetables are also listed as a part of the cuisine.

The passage states that hangi pits are heated by:

*   **Miyala yotentha imene imachokera kumoto** (Hot stones from a fire)
*   **Kutentha kwa mphamvu ya chilengedwe** (Geothermal heat)

The options B and D both refer to the hot stones from a fire, and C refers to geothermal heat. The passage does **not** mention gas/air as a heating method for a hangi.

Ndi chani chimene chingakhale chotsatila chodziwika mwapedela kuchokwera kwa a nsembe kapena a sisitere?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuvala mozikutila chitenje chowala (Wearing a brightly colored sarong)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that if you bring your own sarong, *especially* brightly colored ones, you will be frowned upon by the monks or assistants at the entrance. This makes wearing a bright sarong the most obvious thing that would displease them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuphimba mapewa (Covering shoulders):** The text *requires* women to cover their shoulders, so this wouldn't cause displeasure.
* **C: Kubwereka chitenje ku masisiteli (Borrowing a sarong from the assistants):** The text says you *can* borrow a sarong, so this isn't a cause for disapproval.
* **D: Kuvala siketi yaifupi kulekeza mmaondo (Wearing a short skirt to expose legs):** The text requires covering legs for both men and women.



"
Ndi zovala ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe singapezeke kuti mubwereke kwa ansembe? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kabudula**.

Here's why:

The text states that women should wear long skirts *and cover their shoulders*. A ""kabudula"" (a type of short, often revealing dress) would *not* fulfill either of those requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masiketi (skirts)** - The text specifically mentions women needing to wear skirts.
*   **C: Buluku (wraparound cloth)** - This could be used to cover shoulders, fulfilling the requirement.
*   **D: Zitenje (printed cloth)** - While bringing your own zitenje might be welcomed (and could be used to cover shoulders), the text doesn’t forbid bringing them. It just mentions monks might provide them if you aren't appropriately dressed.

Ndi nthawi iti yomwe alendo akhoza kukhala ndi mwayi woona nyenyezi pamene akuyendera madera a Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Miyezi ya nyengo yozizira**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that polar night (when the sun doesn't rise) occurs *during the winter months* and provides excellent conditions for seeing stars because of the prolonged darkness. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Miyezi ya nyengo ya chilimwe:** The passage says darkness is key for star viewing, and summer has more daylight.
*   **B: Pamene malo alibe chiwerengero cha anthu ambiri:** While the passage mentions sparse population, it doesn't link that directly to star viewing opportunities.
*   **D: Pamene mulingo wowononga kuwala uli wochepelako:** The passage says light pollution isn't really a problem in these areas *because* they are sparsely populated, but the darkness of winter is the primary reason for good star viewing.

Ndi nthawi iti yomwe foni ya setillite siingasinthanitsidwe mmalo mwa foni yam'manja?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngati njira yoonera setillite ikukanizidwa** (If the satellite's line of sight is blocked).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""foni ya satellite sikuti ndimlowa m'malo wa foni yam'manja, poti umayenera kukhala kunja moyang'anizana ndi satellite kuti muyimbe foni.""  This means a clear view of the satellite is *essential* for it to work. If that view is blocked (by trees, buildings, mountains etc.), the satellite phone will be useless.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngati malowo ali ku mudzi kwambiri (If the location is very rural):** The passage states the situation *is* a very rural location, yet a satellite phone is still the only option.  Rural location doesn't prevent the phone from working, just makes it necessary.
* **C: Ngati izizagwiritsidwa kunja (If it's used outdoors):** The passage *requires* being outdoors to use the satellite phone, so this isn’t a limitation.
* **D: Ngati ulendowo umafunika inteneti yapadera (If the trip requires special internet):** The passage doesn't mention internet requirements. It focuses on the basic ability to *make a call*.



"
Ndi nthawi iti yomwe foni ya setillite ingafunikile kuposa foni yam'manja?,"The correct answer is **B: Nthawi yaulendo wapamadzi woyenda ndi bwato**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Kumalo akumudzi komanso akutali, kulibe netiweki ya foni yam'manja, foni ya satellite ndiyokhayo mungagwilitse ntchito. (In remote and rural areas, where there is no mobile phone network, only a satellite phone can be used).  Being on a boat at sea is a classic example of a location with no mobile network coverage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pamene muli kutchuthi mu mzinda** (When you are on vacation in the city) - Cities generally have strong mobile phone coverage.
* **C: Pamene zotolele kafukufuku wakumudzi siozofunikila** (When the results of rural research are not needed) - This doesn't relate to needing a satellite phone.
* **D: Pamene muli ndikuthekera kokhala ndi netiweki pa foni yanu yam'manja** (When you are able to have a network on your mobile phone) -  If you have mobile network access, you don't need a satellite phone.



"
Ndi mikangano ya ziti yomwe inadzetsa dziko la Transnistria kukhala loyima palokha?,"The correct answer is **B: Mtundu wa anthu**.

Here's why:

The text states that Moldova ""imavutika ndi nkhondo zokhuzana ndimitundu"" (struggles with ethnic conflicts) and that the conflict in Transnistria resulted in it becoming a self-declared state. This directly links the independence of Transnistria to ethnic tensions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chuma (Economy)** - While economic relations exist between the sides, the text doesn't state this was the *cause* of Transnistria's separation.
*   **C: Chiyankhulo (Language)** - The text mentions language (Romanian/Russian), but doesn't link it as the primary reason for the conflict.
*   **D: Chipembedzo (Religion)** -  The text mentions Orthodox Christianity, but this isn't presented as a cause of the conflict.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe dziko la Transnistria lilinazo zomwe ndizosiya ndi ena onse a Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **D: Ndalama yadziko** (Currency).

This directly states that Transnistria has its own currency, unlike the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chiyankhulo** - The text says both areas use Russian, so they share a language.
*   **B: Chipembedzo** - The text states Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion in *Moldova* generally, implying it's likely shared in Transnistria as well.
*   **C: Woyimilira UN** - The text states Transnistria *isn't* on the UN list of countries, meaning it doesn't have UN representation. Moldova does.

The passage explicitly states: ""...ambiri mwa omwe amapezeka kuzikondwelero za nyimbo amasankha kumanga msasa ndipo opezeka ambiri amalitenga ngati gawo lofunikira la zomwe amakumana nazo."" (Many of those who attend music festivals choose to set up camp, and many consider it an essential part of their experience.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubwera ndi ana ang'ono (Bringing young children)** - The passage mentions dedicated areas *for* families with young children, but doesn't say it's a core part of everyone's experience.
*   **C: Nyimbo zimaseweredwa mpaka usiku kwambiri (Music played late into the night)** - The passage mentions late-night music, but portrays it as an *option* rather than a crucial element.
*   **D: Kufika/kolowa moyambirila (Arriving/getting in early)** - The passage emphasizes arriving early to *find* a campsite, suggesting the campsite is the important thing, not the early arrival itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupita usiku kwambiri** - While some events have music late into the night, the passage emphasizes *getting a spot*, not just the time of the music.
*   **B: Kukhala mmadera momwe akhala ndi mabanja** - The passage mentions areas specifically *for families*, but doesn't say this is what a concert-goer should prioritize.
*   **C: Kumanga misasa kunya kwa dera lazochitikazo** - The passage focuses on proximity to the music, not necessarily being on the periphery.

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns tourists *against* gambling at bars in small towns. It states: ""Caution: drinking establishments available in small towns are not always good to gamble at for visitors from out of state.""  The reason given is the risk of drunk driving and its prevalence near these small-town bars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pueblo:** While mentioned, the passage doesn't suggest avoiding Pueblos for nightlife.
* **C: Malo ogulitsira zinthu zosiyanasiyana:**  This isn't discussed in the passage.
* **D: Malo osewerela njuga:** The passage focuses on casinos, not general gambling locations.

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndikuti kume alendo angathe kupeza kupeza zosangalatsa zodziwika bwino kumpoto kwa dera latsopano la Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Malo aMidzi ya pueblo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Popeza ma pueblo ambiri amakhala ngati kutali, simungapeze moyo wazochitika wausiku musanapite ku Albuquerque kapena Santa Fe."" This directly links the pueblos (traditional Native American villages) to finding interesting experiences, particularly those not readily available in the larger cities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Malo oyendara njuga oyendeka maola awiri kuchokera ku Albuquerque** - The passage doesn't focus on scenic drives, but rather on the location of pueblos.
*   **C: Molo oyendera njuga oyandikana ndi Sante Fe** - Similar to A, the focus isn't on general scenic areas.
*   **D: Malo omwera mowa opezeka mmizinda ing'onoing'ono** - The passage *warns against* relying on these places for entertainment and highlights the dangers associated with them.

Apaulendo okhala ndi nthumazi ya ndondomeko yawo yachuma/ndalama akhoza kufuna kupewa zakumwa ziti?,"The correct answer is **D: Madzi azipatso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zakumwa za zipatso ndi zokwera mtengo koma zabwino kwambiri.""  Someone on a tight budget (""nthumazi ya ndondomeko yawo yachuma/ndalama"") would likely want to *avoid* expensive drinks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vinyo wadziko la Australia:** The passage mentions New Zealand and Australian wine are readily available, implying they aren't necessarily expensive or hard to find.
*   **B: Madzi ambotolo:** The passage says bottled water is *easier* to find if you're concerned, implying it's not a cost issue.
*   **C: Mowa wa m'deralo:** The passage describes local drinks as fun and refreshing, but doesn't suggest they are expensive.



"
"Kutengera ndi mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi kuitanitsa kwa zakakumwa ziti komwe kungasokonezedwe ndi okupatsilani zakumwa?","The correct answer is **D: Kofi woyera wosalala** (Flat white coffee).

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Anthu ambiri aku Australia, ganizo la ‘flat white’ khofi amalitenga ngati lochokera kunja kwadzikolo."" This means many Australians believe ""flat white"" coffee originates from *outside* their country. Offering someone a flat white could therefore be a source of confusion or a mistaken assumption about its origin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chakumwa chakuda (Black drink):** The passage mentions ""espresso"" as black, but doesn't suggest offering it would cause confusion.
*   **B: Wa nambala yoyamba (‘Nambala Yoyamba’):** This is described as a pleasant drink, not one that causes confusion.
*   **C: Vinyo wa dziko la New Zealand (New Zealand wine):** The passage simply states it's readily available, not that offering it would be problematic.



"
"Kukhala kopitilira zaka mazana atatu, munye ya utsamunda kunayambitsidwa ndi gulu liti?","The correct answer is **D: A Spaniard**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""From the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original natural environment and identity. **Beginning in the 1500s, Paraguay, then known as the “Grand Chaco,” began with the arrival of conquering groups from Spain and its native inhabitants.** The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.""

This directly links the beginning of the three-century colonization period to the arrival of the Spanish.

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, kodi ndi njira yanji yomwe ingapangitse mbadwa ya france kut akusangalalire kapena kumasuka","The correct answer is **C: Kuchita zinthu mwaulemu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that to have an easy time in Paris, you should act like a ""bien eleve"" (well-bred person) and show respect to Parisians. It emphasizes that Parisians are judgmental and will react negatively if you don't treat them with respect. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuyesera kutsanzira zochitita za mbadwa (Trying to imitate the French):** While understanding French customs is helpful, the passage focuses on *respect* as the key, not imitation.
*   **B: Kuonetsa kuzikhulupilira/kupanda mantha (Showing confidence/fearlessness):** The passage doesn't mention confidence as a factor. It focuses on politeness and respect.
*   **D: Kuonetsa khalidwe lomasuka (Showing a relaxed demeanor):** While being relaxed is good generally, the passage specifically says that Parisians are judgmental and require *formal* good manners.



"
"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizitengedwa ngati khalidwe lolakwika la mbadwa?","The correct answer is **C: Kusewera (Playfulness)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that arrogance (kuzikuza) and snobbishness (mwano) are negative traits associated with Parisians. It also mentions self-importance (kudzikonda) and grumpiness (ntudzu) as characteristics. However, the passage *doesn't* mention playfulness as a negative trait. In fact, it suggests being well-mannered (""bien eleve"") which implies a certain level of social grace, not necessarily strictness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makani kapena kuzikuza (Arrogance or boastfulness)** - Directly mentioned as a negative trait.
*   **B: Mwano (Snobbishness)** - Directly mentioned as a negative trait.
*   **D: Mwadzidzidzi kapena modzidzimutsa (Abruptness or rudeness)** - Implied, as disrespecting Parisians leads to negative reactions.



"
Ndi ubwino wanji wokhala gulu lapamwamba loyambirira ku MetroRail mzinda wotchedwa cape tawuni,"The correct answer is **B: Osati anthu ambiri** (Not many people).

Here's why:

*   The passage states ""MetroPlus is less crowded..."" This directly indicates that a benefit of the higher class is fewer passengers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wolamulira sitima alikutsogolo kwa sitima** (The conductor is at the front of the train) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the conductor's location.
*   **C: Ndiyotsikilako mtengo kuposa tikiya ya gulu la anthu achitatu** (It's cheaper than a third-class ticket) - The passage states MetroPlus is *more* expensive than Metro (third class).
*   **D: Ndimitengo yofanana ndi matikiti amatawuni a metro** (It's the same price as metro city tickets) - The passage says it's cheaper than *many* European metro tickets, not the same price."
"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndichani chome sitima iliyonse yapamtunda kudera la cape tawuni ikhala nacho?","The correct answer is **D: Onse masitima agawo loyamba lapamwamba ndi agawo lachitatu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sitima iliyonse ili ndi makochi a MetroPlus ndi Metro"" which translates to ""Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro coaches.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Simudzadza kwambiri musitima** - While the passage says MetroPlus isn't *too* crowded, it doesn't state this is a characteristic of *every* train.
*   **B: Mtengo wa tikiti imodzi yomweyo yamagulu onse awiri** - The passage mentions the price difference between MetroPlus and Metro tickets.
*   **C: Magulu atatu osiyana** - The passage only mentions two classes: MetroPlus and Metro.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe tizilombo toyambitsa mmatenda muzinyama sitingathe kuononga?,"The correct answer is **B: kuyambitsa ziwengo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that tizilombo (germs/microorganisms) can cause:**
    * Food spoilage
    * Allergic reactions (kuyabwa - implying allergies)
    * Physical discomfort/reaction to things ingested
    * Poisoning
    * Spreading of disease (kufalitsa matenda)
    * Injury (through venomous animals - but the passage distinguishes these as *not* tizilombo themselves)

* **Kuyambitsa ziwengo (causing sneezes)** is a very specific symptom often linked to things like dust, pollen, or irritants, *not* typically the direct action of a harmful tizilombo (germ).  While some viruses *can* cause sneezing, it's not a fundamental defining characteristic of how all germs operate. The passage is focusing on more serious effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuyambitsa zotuluka pankhungu/chikopa (causing rashes/skin eruptions):**  Many germs *do* cause skin reactions.
* **C: Kufalitsa matenda (spreading disease):** The passage *explicitly* says germs spread disease.
* **D: Zimayambitsa kuvulala kwa mphavu (causing muscle injury):**  While toxins produced by germs can indirectly affect muscles, the passage discusses venomous animals causing direct injury and points out these aren't germs themselves.



"
Kodi ndikuti kumene mungagule makhadi a foni yolipiliratu?,"The correct answer is **C: Masitolo apangodya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) explicitly states:** ""Sitolo ina iliyonse imene ili pangodya ikumadzaza ndi makadi a foni..."" (Any shop that sells airtime is full of phone cards...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maiko ena (Other countries):** While the passage mentions charges *to* other countries, it doesn't say you *buy* the cards there.
* **B: Malo okwelera sitima yapamtunda (Bus stations):**  This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Pa mafoni olipira (On payphones):** The passage talks about using the cards *with* payphones, not buying them *from* them.



"
Kodi mitengo yabwino yoimbira foni imaperekedwa bwanji pa makhadi ena ogwiritsidwa ntchito?,"The correct answer is **B: Kudzera m'manambala aulele** (Through toll-free numbers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kufikila kuthandizoli kumakhala kudzela m'matelefoni aulere amene utha kuimbila mafoni ambili osalipila kanthu.""  This directly translates to ""Access to this help is through toll-free phones which you can call many phones for free.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akhoza kugwiritsidwa ntchito m'maiko ena (They can be used in other countries):** While the passage mentions some cards have extra costs in other countries, it doesn't say this is *how* the best rates are offered.
* **C: Pasitolo yapangodya (Grocery store):** The passage mentions buying cards at a grocery store, but this isn't related to getting good rates.
* **D: Pogwiritsa nthito foni yolipira ndi kulipira ndala zoonjezera (Using a payphone and paying extra fees):** The passage contrasts using phone cards *instead* of payphones potentially incurring charges.

Here's why:

The passage states that Plitvice Lakes National Park has beech, spruce (sprur), and fir trees. It *does not* mention thundu (pine) trees. The question asks for the tree *not* commonly found there. Therefore, thundu is the answer."
Ndi ziti mwazitsatira zosowa zomwera izi zomwe zikhoza kupezeka ku dera losungulako nyama zakutchire lotchedwa nyanja ya Plitvice?,"The correct answer is **D: Bakha wakutchire** (European wildcat).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...nyama zosowa monga...mphaka wakutchire..."" which translates to ""...rare animals such as...European wildcat...""
* The other options are not mentioned in the text as being found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Therefore, based on the provided text, the European wildcat is the only correct answer."

"Mukafika kwanuko, ndi ndondomeko it imene imakhala yosalongosoka?","The best answer is **C: Mulingo wamalire azithu ovomelezeka pamalamulo** (The limit of goods allowed by law).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on knowing what you *can* and *cannot* bring and declaring anything exceeding legal limits.** This directly relates to the legal limits of goods.
* Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:
    * **A: Chipikisheni choona zaolowa ndi kutuluka dziko** (True inspection of entry and exit of the country) -  While inspections happen, the passage doesn't center on the inspection process itself, but on *your* responsibility to know the rules.
    * **B: Kulengeza zithu zomwe watenga** (Declaring the things you are carrying) - Declaring is part of the process, but it's *because* of the limits imposed by law that you need to declare.
    * **D: Owongolera zakatundu wolowa ndi kutuluka dziko** (Controllers of goods entering and exiting the country) - This describes *who* enforces the rules, not the rules themselves.

The passage emphasizes knowing the permissible limits, making **C** the most relevant and accurate answer.



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe mukuyenela kudziwa musanafika mdziko lanu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngati pafunikile kulengeza katundu amene wapitilira mulingo wamalire ovomelezeka pamalamulo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes knowing what you *must* declare and what exceeds legal limits.** It specifically mentions reporting anything exceeding allowed limits.
* **Option A** talks about potential confiscation, but the passage focuses on *knowing the rules to avoid problems* rather than what happens if you break them.
* **Option C** simply states there are customs officials – it doesn't tell you what *you* need to know.
* **Option D** says something is prohibited, but again, the passage stresses knowing the limits and declaring items, not just avoiding prohibited goods.

Therefore, option B directly reflects the advice given in the passage about being aware of declaration requirements for exceeding legal limits.

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndikuchuluka kwachani kumene kumalola okwera mapiri kupeza njira zina zatsopano mosasitha mkatikati mwa chigwa cha Cochamó?","The correct answer is **D: Zipupa**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""okwera mapiri... akupitilizabe kupeza njira zatsopano **pakati pazipupa zake**"" (climbers continue to find new routes *amongst its cracks*). This directly links the presence of cracks to the ability to discover new climbing paths.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zowona** - This doesn't relate to *why* new routes are found.
*   **B: Misonkhano** - The passage doesn't mention gatherings.
*   **C: Malo apamwamba pa phiri** - While being high up is part of climbing, it doesn't explain the discovery of *new* routes. It's the features *on* the cliffs (the cracks) that make that possible.



"
"Kutengela ndi zimene zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndi ndani amene wayenda madera a mbiri akum'wera kwa dziko lapansi?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance/mgwirizano wa nyenyezi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Star Alliance flies to almost everywhere in the Southern Hemisphere *except* from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti. This implies they have extensive coverage in the Southern Hemisphere.  The passage specifically contrasts them with SkyTeam (who don't cross the three major Southern Hemisphere oceans) and highlights that LATAM Oneworld is a specific route they *don't* cover.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam/ timu ya m'mlengalenga** - The passage explicitly states SkyTeam *doesn't* travel across the Southern Hemisphere oceans.
*   **C: Nyanja yakumwera yapacific** - This is a geographic location, not a travel entity.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld/LATAM dziko limodzi** - While mentioned, LATAM Oneworld only operates *one* specific route in the Southern Hemisphere described in the text. It doesn't represent overall coverage.



"
Ndimgwirizano wakampani ya ndege iti omwe umalipira ndalama zochepa zodutsira panyanja akum'wera kwa dziko lapansi?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance/mgwirizano wa nyenyezi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Star Alliance flies to most destinations in the Southern Hemisphere, including the route from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti (which is a key part of circling the world south of the equator). While LATAM Oneworld *operates* that specific flight, the passage implies Star Alliance generally has the most coverage and therefore the fewest detours needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nyanja yakumwera yapacific** - This is a geographic location, not an airline alliance.
* **C: LATAM Oneworld/LATAM dziko limodzi** - LATAM Oneworld operates *a* flight on the route, but isn't the alliance with the most overall coverage.
* **D: SkyTeam/ timu ya m'mlengalenga** - The passage specifically says SkyTeam *doesn't* fly those routes.

Ndibungwe liti lowona zamaulendo lomwe linapambana mumpikisano wa zoona maulendo wadziko lonse?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours/pitani kwa azamaulendo othamanga**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Go Running Tours *connects* with running tour groups on four continents and specifically mentions forming a partnership with Running Tours Prague *after* having established relationships in Barcelona and Copenhagen. This implies Go Running Tours is the central organizing entity, expanding its reach by collaborating with local groups. 

The question asks which organization ""won"" a travel award. Since Go Running Tours is the one actively building these international connections and partnerships, it's the most logical answer. The other options are simply local affiliates.
"
"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, bungwe la Go Running Tours limalumikizitsa magulu aamabungwe angati owona zamaulendo?","The correct answer is **D: Atatu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states Go Running Tours has relationships with:

*   Running Tours Barcelona
*   Running Copenhagen
*   Running Tours Prague

That's a total of three groups.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anayi** - The passage doesn't mention four groups.
*   **B: Mazana awiri** - The passage mentions over two hundred *travel companies in general*, not specifically those connected to Go Running Tours.
*   **C: Khumi ndi awiri** - This number isn't mentioned in the passage.

Ndichani chimene mlendo akuyenera kuchita ngati akuyembekezera kuti aone mmene cheetah amawonera?,"The correct answer is **C: Gwiritsani ntchito zoonera patali zotchedwa bayinokulasi.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mikango, nyalugwe ndi akambuku nthawi zina amakhala amanyazi ndipo mutha kuwaona bwino pogwiritsa ntchito zoonera patali zotchedwa ma bayinokulazi.""  Cheetahs (akadyansonga) are listed alongside these shy animals, implying binoculars are useful to spot them too.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupita pa ulenedo wapantunda wokaona nyama zakutchire** - While a safari is where you *might* see a cheetah, it doesn't guarantee a good view of a shy one.
*   **B: Kupita koyenda mtchire** - Walking safaris are mentioned, but don't specifically relate to seeing shy animals like cheetahs.
*   **D: Tengani galimoto ndikugwiritsa ntchito zida zokhazikika** -  This is mentioned for animals like elephants who approach vehicles, not for shy animals needing distant observation.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nyama zina monga njovu ndi **akadyansonga** zimakonda kuyandikira ku magalimoto..."" This directly indicates that visitors should expect to encounter lions (akadyansonga) during a safari drive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mikango** - The passage says they are shy and require binoculars to see.
*   **C: Akambuku** - The passage says they are shy and require binoculars to see.
*   **D: Anyalugwe** - The passage says they are shy and require binoculars to see.

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndichani chimene chingachepetse ntengo wandalama zaulendo?","The correct answer is **B: Kupeza gulu la anthu anayi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...yesani kukumana ndi anthu ena ndikupanga gulu la anayi mpaka asanu kuti mulandire mtengo wabwino."" This means forming a group of four to five people will get you a better price.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuyenda wekha** - The passage says prices are *higher* when traveling alone.
* **C: Kuyenda ndi munthu wina** - While better than traveling alone, it doesn't guarantee the *best* price.
* **D: Kupeza gulu la anthu asanu ndi m'modzi kapena ochulukilapo** - The passage specifies a group of *up to* five, not more than five.



"
"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndindani amene ali ndikuthekera kopeza mtengo wabwino kamwbiri waulendo?","The correct answer is **C: Anthu apachinzake kuyendela palimodzi** (People willing to travel together).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that prices are lower in larger groups (4-5 people). It encourages solo travelers or pairs to *find others and form a group* to get a better price. This means people who proactively seek to travel *together* are the ones who benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Apaulendo amene akonzeka kusintha magalimoto** (Travelers willing to change vehicles) - The passage doesn't mention anything about changing vehicles. It focuses on group size.
*   **B: Gulu la anthu atatu** (A group of three people) - While better than one or two, the passage specifies 4-5 people for the best price.
*   **D: Gulu la anthu asanu** (A group of five people) - This is a good group size, but the passage suggests forming a group *to reach* that size, making option C more comprehensive.

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndichani chimene chinathandizira kut dziko la San Francisco kuzindikilika dziko lonse lapansi?","The correct answer is **A: Kupezeka pafupipafupi munjira zochitira za luso ndi kufalitsa nkhani** (Frequent appearances in artistic and media outlets).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: "" *...munyimbo, makanema, zolemba komanso chikhalidwe zodziwika zathandiza kupanga mzindawu ndiponso zochitika zake kudziwika padziko lonse lapansi.*"" This means its presence in songs, movies, literature, and popular culture contributed to its worldwide recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Malo amisonkhano apamwamba kwambiri** (High-end meeting venues) - While San Francisco has these, the passage doesn't highlight them as a primary reason for its global fame.
*   **C: Zachuma zosiyanasiyana** (Diverse economy) - The passage mentions the diverse economy, but states it *is* the economy, rather than what made it famous.
*   **D: Zochitika zatsopano za zakudya za dziko la Asia** (New Asian cuisine experiences) - Asian cuisine is highlighted as a *feature* of San Francisco, but not as the main driver of its global recognition.

Here's why:

The passage states travel agencies can *hold* a reservation for you if you need time to obtain documents like a visa. This implies someone *without* the necessary documentation would be the type of traveler who *wouldn't* benefit from the services - they need time to *get* the visa, and the agency can help facilitate that by holding the booking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wapaulendo wokayikakayika (Indecisive traveler):** The agency can hold reservations for those needing time to decide.
*   **B: Wapaulendo wodzidzimuka (Spontaneous traveler):**  The agency can still book for them, even if they haven't planned far ahead.
*   **D: Wapaulendo amene amakonda malonda aphukusi (Traveler who likes package deals):** The passage explicitly states agencies often *offer* these packages.

    *   **C: Phukusi lazonse (Complete packages)** - Mentions packages including breakfast, airport transfers, and sometimes flights & accommodation.

*   **The passage *does not* mention:**
    *   **A: Zikalata zoyendela paulendo zachangu (Fast travel documents)** - While it mentions showing letters of invitation (like a Visa), it doesn't say the travel agent speeds up the document *process* itself.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that these translation apps ""zitha kutanthauzira zolembedwa muzilankhulo zakunja malingana ndi zizindikiro kapena zinthu zenizeni zina zomwe zaonetsedwa pamene ogwiritsa ntchito akuloza foni yake yam'manja ku zinthuzi."" This directly describes translating text seen through a phone's camera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuthandauzira zizindikira mu chiyankhulo chadziko lina** - While they translate *into* other languages, the passage focuses on translating *from* visible text.
*   **B: Kumasulira gawo lonse lolembedwa** -  The passage mentions they *can* translate entire texts, but the emphasis is on the real-world object recognition aspect.
*   **D: Kumasulira molondola kufikila maperesenti zana limodzi nthawi yonse** - The passage explicitly states they are *not* always accurate and require caution.

Chimalola kumasulira kuti kudzichitika pamene ulibe intaneti ndi chani?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutenga chiyankhulo mukufuna kutanthauzila kapena kugwiritsa ntchito pa intaneti**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...Google Translate, yomwe imalola kutanthauzira popanda kukhala pa intaneti ngati mwatenga kale kuchokera pa intaneti zofunikira zachilankhulo chomwe mukufuna.""  This directly explains how you can translate without internet – by downloading the language beforehand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makina omasulira anasinthidwa bwino** - While true, this doesn't explain *how* offline translation is possible.
*   **B: Foni ya m'manja** - A phone is the *device* used, but doesn't enable the offline translation itself.
*   **D: Mapologalamu agulu lomasulira pompopompo** - This is a general description of the type of software, but doesn't explain the specific method for offline use.



"
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizimayambitsa zigumukile?,"The correct answer is **A: Chipale chofewa chomata** (A soft, stuck snowpack).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that avalanches are caused by things *releasing* a snowpack. A soft, stuck snowpack is the *opposite* of what would cause an avalanche – it's stable.  The other options are all listed as potential triggers:

* **B: Anthu** (People) – The passage states people can trigger avalanches.
* **C: Kuwala kwa dzuwa** (Sunlight) – Sunlight warming snow is mentioned as a trigger.
* **D: kuonjezelekera kugwa kwa chipale chofewa** (Increased snowfall of soft snow) – Accumulation of soft snow is also mentioned as a trigger.

Therefore, a soft, stuck snowpack wouldn’t initiate an avalanche, it would contribute to stability."
"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zimagwapansi ngati zigumukire?","The correct answer is **C: Kuchuluka kwa chipale chofewa mmalo otsetseleka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that avalanches happen when there's a build-up (""kuchuluka"") of soft snow (""chipale chofewa"") on steep slopes (""malo otsetseleka"").  The passage describes how this build-up eventually becomes unstable and releases as an avalanche.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chipale chofewa chomata chomwe sichinayambitse** - While a cohesive snowpack is mentioned as a factor, the passage focuses on *accumulated* snow.
*   **B: Malo otsetseleka opanda chipale chofewa** - Avalanches *require* snow; they don't happen where there isn't any.
*   **D: Chipale chofewwa chomwe sichinagwiridwe ndi anthu** - Human triggering is mentioned as *one* cause, but avalanches can happen due to natural causes as well (sun, precipitation). The passage doesn't specify that only untouched snow avalanches.

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, kale wakudya amapangidwa kuchokera ku zipangizo zosakanizira ziti?","The correct answer is **B: Zitsamba ndi zonunkhiritsa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Curry ndi chakudya chomwe chimapangidwa kuchokera ku **zitsamba ndi zonukhira**..."" (Curry is a dish made from **spices and herbs**...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yogati ndi madzi** - Yogurt is used in *some* curries, but it's not a fundamental ingredient in *all* curries.
*   **C: Mkaka wa kokonati ndi nyama** - Coconut milk is used in *some* curries, and meat can be *added* to curries, but neither is the base ingredient.
*   **D: Ndiwo za masamba ndi mkaka** - While vegetables can be in curry, and milk is used in some, it's not the foundational components.



"
"Mumadera ena, mkaka wa kokonati nthawi zina umagwiritsidwa m'malo mwazosakanizira ziti?","The correct answer is **C: Yogati**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...in northern areas of India and Pakistan, yogurt is used extensively in curries; whereas in southern India and coastal parts of India, coconut milk is used extensively.""  This directly implies that coconut milk is sometimes used *instead of* yogurt in certain regions.

* **C: Mathilakitale apadera siachangu** - Cholumbacho sichinena za kufulumira kwa mathilakitale.
* **D: Ndizosavutilako kusiyana ndi kuyenda kudera ku nyanja Ross** - Cholumbacho sichinena za kuwutsinika kwapadera kwa dera la Ross Sea."
Mbali mwa nsewu wakum'mawa wotchedwa South Pole Traverse muli chani chimene chinaikidwa chizindikiro pozikidwa mbendera?,"The correct answer is **C: M'mpita wodzadza ndi chipale chofewa** (A path filled with soft snow).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndimadzi ouma ofewa koma othinana omwe ali ndi ming'alu ikuluikulu yomwe ili ndizizindikiro."" (It is soft but firm dry ice with large drifts which are landmarks). This directly describes the traverse being marked by drifts of soft snow.
* The question asks what marks the route, and soft snow drifts are the described landmarks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Njira ya njanji ku malo okwelera ndi kutsikira sitima otchedwa McMurdo** (A railway route to loading and unloading stations called McMurdo) - The passage doesn't mention a railway.
* **B: Mathilakitala omwe akunyamula mafuta agalimoto** (Fuel tanks for vehicles) - While fuel is carried *on* the traverse, the tanks themselves aren't the landmark.
* **D: Kuwopsya koyenda mokhota kuzungulira mapiri** (The danger of difficult travel around mountains) - This describes a characteristic of the *route*, not something that *marks* the route.

Ndi chani chimene sichinatchulidwe mu m'ndimeyi ngati chinachake choti alendo azichidziwa akamayenda ku m'mwera kwa Afilika?,"The correct answer is **C: Pafupifupi maiko onse omwe ali m'malire kapena omwe anazungulira chigawo chakum'mwera cha Afilika ndi okhazikika.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Dzindikirani kuti pomwe mukukonzekera kuti kumwera kwa Africa ndikwabata koma osati mayiko onse oyandikana ali pamtendere.**"" This directly contradicts option C, making it the information *not* mentioned as something travelers should know.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage does mention visa requirements (""Zofunikira pa Visa pamodzi ndi mitengo yake zimakhala zosiyanasiyana kutengera dziko lomwe ukuchokera."").
*   **B:** This is a direct statement from the passage (""Kulowa Kumwera kwa Africa pa galimoto ndi njira yabwino yoonera kukongola kwa dera komanso kufikira malo amene samatchulidwa njira zodutsa alendo."").
*   **D:** The passage recommends 4x4 vehicles (""ma 4x4 ndi amene aliwoyenera ndipo malo ambiri amafikidwa ndimagalimoto am'mwamba a 4X4 basi."").

"M'monga zafotokozeledwa mu mndimeyi,ndi langizo liti lingatengdwe ngati loyipa kwa alendo amene akufuna kukayendera chigawo chakum'mwera cha Afilika pa galimoto?","The correct answer is **D: Simadela onse ozungulira chigawo chakum'mwera cha Afilika omwe ndiabwino kukaona.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Note that while Southern Africa is captivating, not all bordering countries are at peace."" This is a direct warning about potential danger and instability in some areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zinthu zina zapangozi za mgalimoto zikhoza kukhala zofunika pa malamulo** - The passage *mentions* that each country has rules regarding accidents, but doesn't frame this as a warning. It's just a practical piece of information.
* **B: Ngakhale mtundu wa galimoto yamwamba ya anayi mwa anayi kapena kuti 4x4 umalimbikitsidwa, m'madera ena amafikilidwa ndi galimoto wamba** - This is a statement about vehicle types, not a safety concern.
* **C: Kuyenda pagalimoto ndi kwabwino kwa amene akufuna kusintha njira zofanana** - The passage states driving is good for *exploring off-the-beaten-path*, but doesn't highlight it as a negative.

Here's why:

*   **The passage mentions:**
    *   Theft (A: Zikhoza kubedwa) - ""Zikwama zokhala zokha zimakhala pa chiopsezo chobedwa""
    *   Drug smuggling (B: Ukhoza kukhala wonyamula makhwala ozunguza bongo mokusadziwa) - ""Mutha kugwiritsidwa ntchito kunyamula mankhwala ozunguza bongo musakudziwa""
    *   Bomb threat (D: Akuluakulu akhoza kuziona ngati chiopsezo cha mabomba) - ""Zimapatsa chidwi akuluakulu poganiza kuti mutha kukhala muli bomba""

*   **The passage does *not* mention:** any possibility of someone else tampering with the bag, such as opening it or altering its contents.

Therefore, option C is the only risk not stated in the text."
Ndi chani chimene sichatchulidwe mu m'ndimeyi chokhudzana ndikunyamula makhwala ozunguza bongo?,"The correct answer is **A: Mumaiko ena, wopalamula mlandu koyamba akhoza kupatsidwa chilango choti aphedwe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mayiko ena ali ndi zilango zokhaulitsa ngakhale kwa omwe alakwitsa koyamba, anthu amawatumiza kundende kwa zaka 10."" (Some countries have severe penalties even for first-time offenders, people are sent to prison for 10 years). It *doesn't* mention fines as a possible punishment.

Let's look at why the other options are correct and mentioned in the passage:

* **B: Nkofunika Kusamala mwapadera pamene mukuyenda kupita dziko lina** - The passage explicitly warns about carrying luggage across borders.
* **C: Agalu onunkhiza mwankhwala ndi zina akhoza kugwiritsidwa ntchito opanda chenjezo** -  The passage mentions ""agalu onukhiza amatha kuwagwiritsa ntchito nthawi iliyonse opanda chenjezo.""
* **D: Akuluakulu akhoza kulanda zikwama, ngakhale mutakhala kuti simunanyamule makhwala ozunguza bongo** - The passage states that unattended bags attract attention and officials might suspect them of containing bombs.



"
Ndichakumwa chanji chimene sizinatchulidwe ngati chomwe mukhoza kupanga kunyumba nthawi yopuma?,"The correct answer is **C: Mowa**.

Here's why:

* **Khofi** and **tiyi** are specifically mentioned as drinks you make at home (coffee in the morning, chamomile tea at night).
* **Juwisi** is explicitly suggested as something you *can* make at home with a blender.
* **Mowa** is described as something you get at a hidden bar in a city with diverse traditions - meaning it's *not* something you make at home during your leisure time, according to the passage.

Therefore, mowa (alcohol) is the only drink listed that isn't presented as a homemade option for relaxation."
Ndiziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe mukuyenela kukayendera nthawi yopumula ngati mzinda wanu umadziwika ndi zakumwa zachikhalidwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Malo omwera mowa, zakumwa zina ndi zakudya zosiyanasiyana omwe simumapita kawirikawiri**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ngati ukukhala mu mzinda umene uli ndi miyambo yosiyanasiyana ya kamwedwe, pita kumalo omwela mowa amene ali mudela lomwe sufikafikako."" This directly suggests visiting unique bars/drinking establishments when on vacation in a city known for its traditional drinks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masitilo ogulitsa khofi panja pamalo amene mwazungulilidwa** - The passage mentions coffee, but not specifically visiting coffee shops as a vacation activity.
*   **B: Juwisi kapena zipatso zakasakaniza zosinjidwa bwino** - The passage suggests making juice, not necessarily going *out* to get it.
*   **D: Malo amene amaphika tiyi wa chamomile** - Chamomile tea is mentioned as a nightly routine, not as a vacation destination.



"
Kodi ziboliboli zankhunda zili dera liti?,"The correct answer is **B: Mubwalo la kachisi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mu bwalo la tchalitchi muli zosema zochititsa chidwi za nkhunda pa ziliza zina."" This translates to ""In the churchyard there are interesting carvings of seals on some stones.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mtunda woyenda theka la ola kuchoka kumudzi** - This describes the location of the village, not the carvings.
*   **C: Pa chiumba cha Eysturoy** - Eysturoy is a separate island visible from the village.
*   **D: Nkati mwa kachisi** - While the carvings are *in* the churchyard, ""mubwalo la kachisi"" (in the churchyard) is the more specific location given in the text.



"
Ndi ntundu uti wachikalata chokuloleza kupita dziko lina umene ungafune munthu kuti apereke umboni wokwanira wachithandizo cha ndalama?,"The correct answer is **D: chitupa chachikalata choyendera chokaphunzilira sukulu**.

The passage specifically states that student visas (chitupa choyendera chokaphunzilira sukulu) often require proof of sufficient funds for at least the first year of studies (umboni wa ndalama zodzithandizira zosachepera chaka choyamba chamaphunziro). The other options (business, tourism, short-term) are not mentioned as requiring this level of financial proof."
Ndi ndani amene angafunikile chitupa chachikalata choyendera chowonjezera?,"The correct answer is **C: Amene akuphunzira sukulu dziko lina** (Someone studying in another country).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that students studying abroad need different and more extensive documentation (""visa"") than tourists or business travelers due to the longer duration of their stay. It details requirements like acceptance letters and proof of funds specifically for students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mlendo wobwerabwera** (Returning visitor): The passage implies shorter trips for tourists don't always require extensive visas.
*   **B: Wapaulendo woyenda nyengo zosiyanasiyana** (Seasonal tourist):  Like returning visitors, these are generally shorter-term travelers.
*   **D: Wapaulendo amene akuzapanga buzinesi** (Business traveler): The passage states business travelers have different requirements than students, but not necessarily more extensive ones *overall* than tourists.



"
Ndinthawi iti imene mukuyenera kusamala za udzudzu?,"The correct answer is **A: Miyezi ya nyengo ya chilimwe (During the summer months)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Makamaka mchilimwe musamale kwambiri udzudzu..."" (Especially in summer, be very careful of ticks...). This directly links tick awareness to the summer months.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pamene mukayenda (When you are walking):** While walking in the forest is mentioned as a risk, the passage emphasizes the *time of year* first.
* **C: Munkhalango ya nvula (In the rainy forest):** The passage doesn't specifically mention rain, only forests.
* **D: Poyendetsa galimoto (When driving a car):** The passage *mentions* ticks getting into cars, but this is a consequence of being in the forest during summer, not the primary time to be careful.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, kodi muyenera kupewa chiyani kuti mupewe udzudzu mukamayendetsa munkhalango ya nvula?","The correct answer is **A: Kusiya zitseko zagalimoto zotseguka kwa nthawi yayitali** (Leaving car doors open for a long time).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...kanthawi kochepa zitseko zili zotsegula, pamene muzilowaso mgalimoto ndi nthawi yokwanira kwa udzudzu kulowa namu limodzi mgalimoto."" (Even when passing through forests in less hot areas, for a short time the doors are open, and when you get into the car there is enough time for ticks to enter with you).  This directly links leaving doors open to the risk of ticks getting into the vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuyenda pagalimoto m'nyengo yachilimwe** (Driving in the summer): The passage mentions summer, but doesn't say *avoid* driving then, just that it's a time when ticks are very common.
* **C: Kuyenga pa galimoto kumadera otentha** (Driving in hot areas): The passage mentions hot areas, but doesn’t advise avoiding them. It actually states ticks can be found even in forests in less hot areas.
* **D: Kusiya galimoto opanda oiyang'anira pamene mukukayenda** (Leaving the car unattended while walking):  The passage doesn't mention leaving the car unattended.

Ndi mbali iti ya nkhalango yomwe ili m'chigawo cha India?,"The correct answer is **A: Malo osungilako nyama zakutchire otchedwa Sundarbans National Park**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Gawo la nkhalango m'chigawo cha India limatchedwa Sundabrbans National Park."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Malo osungira nyama zakutchire** - This is too general. The text names a *specific* park.
*   **C: Mlao otetezedwa acholowa a dziko lonse** - While Sundarbans *is* a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the question asks about the part *within India*.
*   **D: Chigwa cha Gangetic** - The text mentions Sundarbans contains remnants of the Gangetic basin, but it's not the name of the forest section in India.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndani amene angamvetse bwino Chingelezi?","The correct answer is **B: Anthu ocheperapo msinkhu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mayiko ambiri amalankhula bwino Chingerezi kwathunthu, ngakhale kwambiri umayembekezera kuti amadziwa mochepa makamaka pakati pa achinyamata."" (Many countries speak English well overall, though it is more likely they know less, especially among the young.)

This directly indicates that younger people are less likely to be fluent in English. Therefore, the answer must be people of fewer numbers, as the passage explicitly states younger generations know less English.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anthu olankhula zinenero zina zosachepera ziwiri** - The passage doesn't discuss multilingualism and its relation to English proficiency.
*   **C: Anthu amapita ku Toronto** - Toronto is simply a location used in the example; it doesn’t mean everyone there is fluent in English.
*   **D: Anthu achikulire mu msinkhu** - The passage states the opposite – that older people are *more* likely to know English well.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani chomwe chingakhale chovuta kutchula?","The correct answer is **A: Mawu m'zinenero zosiyanasiyana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izi ndizowona makamaka pama keyala, amene amakhala ovuta kuwatchula momveka bwino.""  ""Ma keyala"" refers to spoken words/dialects in different languages. The passage specifically highlights the difficulty in distinguishing clearly spoken words, particularly dialects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maadiresi** - The passage doesn't mention addresses.
*   **C: Mawu olembedwa** - The passage actually says written words are *easier* to understand than spoken words.
*   **D: Chiyankhulo cha eniake malo** - While the example illustrates different accents, the passage focuses on the difficulty of understanding *spoken* language generally, not just the accents of specific places.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndizochitika ziti zomwe zingakhale zabwino kwa wapaulendo akukonzekera kukwera basi kuchokera kumalo okwelerawo omwe ali pakatikati pamaboma?","The correct answer is **A: Wapaulendo akupita ku Jakar ndipo awagula kale tikiti nthawi ya ulendo isanafike**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ambiri makamaka opita kum'mawa ndi ku Jakar/Bumthang amanyamuka pakati pa 6:30 ndi 7:30."" and ""Popeza mabasi oyenda m'maboma amakhala odzaza ndibwino kuguliratu matikiti masiku angapo ulendo usadafike.""
* This means buses to Jakar (and Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30, and it's *recommended* to buy tickets in advance due to crowds. Option A reflects both of these points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The text says buses to Bumthang leave *before* 7:30, not *after*.
* **C:** The text doesn't mention Paro or any specific time after 11.
* **D:** The text says buses heading east leave *between* 6:30 and 7:30, so arriving before 6:20 isn't specifically mentioned as being beneficial.



"
Kodi upangiri wabwino ungakhale uti kwa mlendo amene akufuna kupita kummawa kuchokera kokwerera mabasi?,"The best advice for a traveler wanting to go east from the bus station, based on the passage, is **B: Gulani tikiti pasadakhale (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Popeza mabasi oyenda m'maboma amakhala odzaza ndibwino kuguliratu matikiti masiku angapo ulendo usadafike."" (Because buses going to the east are full, it is good to buy tickets a few days before your trip.)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mabasi amanyamuka ikangodutsa 8:30 (Buses leave after 8:30)** - The passage states most leave *between* 6:30 and 7:30.
* **C: Mabasi ambiri amayenda tsiku lonse (Many buses run all day)** - While true in general, the passage emphasizes the early departure times for eastward routes.
* **D: Ma taxi ogawana angakhale njira yanzeru kwambiri yoyendera (Shared taxis might be a very wise way to travel)** - The passage suggests taxis for *short* distances like Naro and Punakha, not specifically for going east.



"
Ndi ziti mwa zotsatirazi zomwe sizikulongosola zolondola za Timbuktu?,"Correct answer is **C: Sizifikirika ndi ndege**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ali ndibwalo la ndege"" which translates to ""it has an airport."" Therefore, Timbuktu *is* accessible by plane, making option C inaccurate.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Ili ndi chikoka cha Chiarabu kuposa dziko lonselo** (""It has a strong Arabic influence compared to other regions."") - The passage states Timbuktu is unique and has a very strong Arabic influence compared to other parts of Africa.
*   **B: Ndi umphawi** (""It is poor."") - The passage says Timbuktu is a ""town in difficulty,"" suggesting it struggles with poverty.
*   **D: Imakhalabe chokopa kwa alendo achidwi** (""It remains a draw for tourists."") - The passage mentions its history helps attract tourists.



"
Mfundo zotsatirazi za Timbuktu ndizowona?,"The correct answer is **A: Mzindawu umafikako ndi ndege**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""...and it has an airport."" (ndipo ali ndibwalo la ndege).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndi zachilendo kuposa osauka** - The passage doesn't discuss Timbuktu's economic status relative to others.
*   **C: Ili ndi kukongola kochepa kwa Africa kuposa mizinda yozungulira** - The passage mentions its unique history and connection to Luya culture, not its aesthetic compared to other African cities.
*   **D: Mzindawu sukopekanso ndi alendo** - The passage states: ""...its history helps attract tourists..."" (mbiri yake imathandiza kukopa alendo). Therefore, it *does* still attract tourists.



"
Kodi maseŵera a Olimpiki a m’chilimwe amakodzedwa nthawi iti? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ogasiti 2021**.

The text states: ""Masewero a Olimpiki ya anthu aulumali izachitika kuyambira **24 Ogasiti** mpaka 5 Seputembala 2021."" 

Therefore, the Summer Olympics are scheduled for August 2021."
"Malinga ndi m'mene zafitokozeledwa mu mndimeyi, ndi nthawi yanji yomwe funnel anasanduka chimphepo?","The correct answer is **D: Atagwira pansi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It begins as a funnel descending from storm clouds and becomes a ‘whirlwind’ once it reaches the ground."" This directly links the transition to a whirlwind (which is essentially a tornado) with *reaching the ground*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pamene mphepo ikufika pafupifupi makilomita zana limodzi pa ola** - The passage says the tornado *creates* winds of 100-200 mph, it doesn't say that's when it becomes a whirlwind.
*   **B: Pamene mizati ya mpweya yamba kupota** - This describes the initial formation, not the point it becomes a whirlwind.
*   **C: Potsika kuchokera ku mitambo yamkuntho** - This is just the starting point of the funnel, before it reaches the ground.



"
Ndi mfundo iti yomwe ili yolondola yokhudza mphepo ya tornado?,"The correct answer is **C: Amakhala funnel akakhudza pansi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zimayamba ngati ma fanelo kutsika kumitambo ndipo nkukhala “kamvuluvulu” akafika pansi."" This directly translates to ""They start as funnels descending from the clouds and become a 'funnel' when they reach the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nthawi zonse mphepo zizungulira pakati pa zana limodzi-mazana awiri a mamailosi pa ola (Always winds circulate between one hundred and two hundred miles per hour)** - The passage says ""mamayilosi 100-200 / ola"" which means *typically* or *often* (100-200 mph), not *always*.
* **B: Nthawi zambiri amayenda ndi zinthu zolemera (Often travel with heavy objects)** - While true, this is a *result* of a tornado, not a defining characteristic of what a tornado *is*.
* **D: Ndi mizati yozungulira yomwe imakankhira mpweya kunja (Are rotating columns that push air outwards)** - The passage describes tornadoes as *drawing* air in, not pushing it out.

"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, kodi woyenda ayenera kupeza kuti malangizo okhudza mmene ndale zikuyendera mumzinda wa komwe akupita?","The correct answer is **B: Kuchokera pamawonedwe operekedwa mkati mwa chenjezo laulendo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Machenjezo amenewa ndichindunji cham'mene ndale zikuyendera mu dziko."" (These warnings are an indication of how politics are going in the country.) This directly implies that travel warnings contain information about the political situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchokera ku boma la dziko iwo adzakhala akuchezera** - The passage states the government's advice is good for *their own citizens* (""zikani zawo""), not necessarily for travelers.
*   **C: Kuchokera ku mzika za dziko lokacheza** - The passage contrasts advice for citizens with what travelers might need.
*   **D: Kuchokera ku boma lawo lomwe** - The passage emphasizes needing to understand the political situation *in the destination country*, not your home country.



"
"Pakachitika upangiri waulendo, ndi chiyani chomwe mzika yakunja siyingakumane nazo?","The correct answer is **B: Kufotokozera mwachidule za ndale za dziko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that advice given to citizens is good *for their citizens*, and that information given to foreigners is more concise (""achidule"") than the detailed information available to citizens.  This implies a foreigner *won't* get the detailed political breakdown a citizen would.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inshuwaransi yomwe yakhudzidwa ndi chiletso (Insurance affected by restrictions):** The passage explicitly states travel and health insurance *can* be affected.
* **C: Inshuwaransi yazaumoyo yokhudzidwa (Health insurance affected):** Similar to A, this is stated as a possibility.
* **D: Zambiri zokhudzana ndi ndale za dziko (Information related to the country's politics):** While the information *is* political, the passage says foreigners receive a *simplified* version, meaning they still *receive* some information.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi ulendo uti womwe sungafunike thandizo kudula tiketi kuchokera kwa wothandizira maulendo?","The correct answer is **A: Ulendo wopita ku msonkhano wa ntchito mumzinda womwe wapaulendo adayenderapo kale**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a travel agent is *most* useful when you want to experience something **different** from what you've encountered before – different environments, cultures, languages, or economically disadvantaged countries. 

Going to a work conference in a city you've already visited doesn't fall into this category. It's a familiar trip, and doesn't require the specialized knowledge a travel agent would provide for a more unique or challenging journey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ulendo wautali wa milungu iwiri pa bajeti yapadera kwambiri** - This sounds like it could benefit from a travel agent's expertise in finding deals and managing logistics.
*   **C: Ulendo womwe chiyanhkulo chikhale vuto lalikulu** - A travel agent could help with translation resources or recommend destinations where language isn't a barrier.
*   **D: Wapaulendo ulendo wake woyamba kupita kunja** - First-time travelers often need a lot of help with planning and understanding the complexities of international travel.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi zochitika ziti zomwe munthu wapaulendo angapindule kwambiri ndi chithandizo cha anthu othandizila zapaulendo?","The correct answer is **B: Pamene wapaulendo akufuna kukodza ulendo wapadera kwa nthawi yoyamba.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents (mkhalapakati) are *especially* useful when ""ulendo wanu ndiwofuna kuwona zosiyana ndizimene mudakomana nawo wam'mbuyomu pazachilengedwe, chikhalidwe, chilankhulo kapena mayiko omwe chuma chawo chili chotsika.""  This translates to: ""your trip is to see something different than you've experienced before in terms of nature, culture, language, or countries with lower economies.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention booking return tickets as a specific benefit.
* **C:** Knowing the language of the destination would *reduce* the need for a travel agent.
* **D:**  If a traveler is already familiar with a culture, they wouldn't necessarily need a travel agent's expertise.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, nchiyani chingathandize munthu wapaulendo kuti asakhumudwe akamayendera malo atsopano?","The correct answer is **B: Kufunitsitsa kuyesa zakudya zomwe nzachilendo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that things will be *different* in a new place.** It specifically lists differences in food, customs, laws, etc.  The key to avoiding frustration is accepting and preparing for those differences. Trying new foods is an example of embracing those differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuyembekezera miyezo yofanana ndi komwe akuchokera** - The passage *explicitly states* not to expect things to be the same.
* **C: Kutsatira malamulo omwewo monga akuchokera** -  The passage says laws will be *different*.
* **D: Kupewa kufufuza koyambirira pa malo ogona** - While researching lodging is good, the passage doesn't suggest avoiding it; it simply says lodging *will* be different.



"
"Malinga ndi zimene zili m’ndimeyi, kodi ndi munthu wotani amene angakhumudwe akamapita kudziko lina?","The correct answer is **C: Wina yemwe ali wotseka maganizo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that understanding differences in customs, laws, food, etc., is important to *avoid* frustration. This implies that someone who is inflexible and unwilling to accept differences (i.e., close-minded) is the one most likely to be frustrated when traveling to a new place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Munthu amene amakonda zakudya zachilendo** - Someone who enjoys trying new foods would be *less* likely to be frustrated.
* **B: Munthu amene amasangalala ndi kusintha** - This person would likely embrace the differences and not be frustrated.
* **D: Munthu amene amakonda kuphunzira** - A person who likes to learn would be open to experiencing new things and wouldn't easily get frustrated.



"
Ndi malangizo ati mwa awa omwe siwoyenerera kwa apaulendo omwe abwera kudziko losauka koyamba?,"The correct answer is **B: Pewani kudya zakudya zambiri m'masiku oyambirira**.

Here's why:

The passage *recommends* easing into a new culture by starting with familiar accommodations, good food, and services to adjust. It doesn't suggest avoiding local food altogether, but rather starting with comfort before venturing out. The other options are directly mentioned as precautions:

*   **A:** Is directly stated - ""Osagona pa matilesi pansi mdera lomwe zinyama zake simukuzidziwa."" (Don't sleep on the floor in an area where you don't know the animals).
*   **C:** Is directly stated - ""Pamene mukufuna kokamanga msasa, tengani kama komanso machira..."" (When building a shelter, take a mosquito net and sheets...).
*   **D:** Is a rephrasing of the entire point of the passage. The passage talks about being mindful of cultural differences and taking time to adjust.



"
Ndi ziti mwa zotsatirazi zomwe sizikutchulidwa kuti ndizofunika kusokoneza mukazolowera dziko lomwe likutukuka kumene?,"The correct answer is **A: Chakudya cha mayiko aku kumadzulo kwa dziko**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions the importance of seeking out ""western-style accommodation, good food, and other amenities"" to ease the transition. It *doesn't* say to specifically seek out Western food. Instead, it implies finding *good* food in general as a comfort.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned as important:

* **B: Ntchito zabwino (Good amenities):** The passage directly states to look for ""other amenities.""
* **C: matiresi kapena mapadi pomanga msasa (mattresses or pads when building a shelter):**  The passage advises taking a mat and sheets to avoid being bitten by snakes while sleeping.
* **D: Myumba zogonamo alendo zapamwamba (High-end guest houses):** The passage suggests ""western-style accommodation"" which implies a level of comfort and quality like that found in good guest houses.

"Ndi njira ziti mwa zotsatirazi zomwe zingakhale zabwino kwambiri kwa omwe ali ndi mfundo zomwe akufuna kope yonvera ya ndondomeko zamalamulo zawo, koma osangapeza mwayi wa intaneti?","The correct answer is **C: kusunga kopi mu laputopu** (saving a copy in a laptop).

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Mukamayenda ndi laputopu kapena kompuyuta yam'manja yotchedwa tablet, muzisunga zina mu memory card kapena disc (zokuti mutha kuzipeza wopanda intaneti).""  This directly addresses the scenario of needing access *without* internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kupereka kope kwa woyenda naye paulendo** (Giving a copy to a travel companion) - While helpful, it doesn't guarantee *you* have a copy readily available if your companion isn't with you.
* **B: Kudzitumizira okha kope** (Emailing a copy to yourself) -  This relies on internet access to retrieve the email. The question specifically asks about situations *without* internet.
* **D: ""Kusunga kope mu """"malo otsungira pa internet"""" otchedwa cloud""** (Saving a copy in the ""cloud"") - This *requires* internet access, making it unsuitable for the scenario.



"
"Malinga ndi zimene zafotokozeledwa mndimeyi, ndi ziti mwa zotsatirazi zomwe siziyenera kuwonetsedwa pa ndondomeko ya malamulo?","The correct answer is **A: Nambala zamafoni zapadziko lonse lapansi zofunsira ndalama (International toll-free numbers for requesting funds)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes needing contact information for *receiving* permission, advice, and assistance from the insurance company. It focuses on numbers for *getting help*.  Requesting funds isn't a service the insurance company would proactively offer contact numbers for in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the text:

* **B: Adilesi yakalata zapa intaneti ya imelo ya wainshuwaransi (Policyholder's internet email address):** The text explicitly states to show the insurance email address.
* **C: Nambala zamafoni zapadziko lonse lapansi zovomerezeka (International toll-free numbers for authorization):** The text mentions needing phone numbers for getting authorization.
* **D: Adilesi ya imelo ya Policy Holder (Policy Holder's email address):** The text states you need to display the insurance email address.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi kukula kolakwika kotani komwe kumawonetsa mawonekedwe a kanema omwe amagwiritsidwa ntchito kwambiri?","The correct answer is **D: Mamilimita amanegative okwanira makumi atatu ndi chisanu ndi chimodzi mwa makumi awiri ndi zinayi**.

Here's why:

The text states the standard 35mm film negative is 36mm x 24mm.  It then states the 6x6 film negative is 56mm x 56mm.  Therefore, the area of the 35mm negative is 36 * 24 = 864mm² and the area of the 6x6 negative is 56 * 56 = 3136mm². The passage says that the 6x6 negative gives an image roughly *four times* the size of the 35mm negative (3136mm² versus 864mm²).
"
Ndi mitundu iti yamakanema otsatirawa yomwe imapereka zithuzi zofanana ndi DSLR?,"The correct answer is **C: Mamilimita afilimu okwanira makumi asanu ndi chimodzi mwa makumi asanu ndi chimodzi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that medium format cameras use 6x6 film, which results in a negative area of 56mm x 56mm. It also highlights that this is roughly *four times* the area of a 35mm negative. The question asks which format provides a similar result to a DSLR (which implies larger image quality).  The 56mm x 56mm format is the one described as significantly larger, making it the closest analogue to the image quality one might expect from a DSLR.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi iti mwa izi yomwe ingakhale sitepe yomaliza kuyambitsa bizinesi yolemba maulendo?","The correct answer is **C: Panga webusaiti yaiwe mwini** (Create your own website).

Here's why:

The passage states that after becoming comfortable with creating and modifying content online, the *next* step is to create your own website. This implies it's the final step in getting the business up and running, after learning and practicing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Phunzirani kufufuta zinthu pawebusaiti** (Learn to scrape things from a website) - The passage doesn't mention scraping.
*   **B: Lembani nkhani zingapo kumalo amene amakamba zaapaulendo otchedwa blog yodziwika bwino** (Write several articles to a well-known travel blog) - This is presented as a way to *learn* and gain experience, not the final step of starting your own business.
*   **D: Konzani luso lanu lla editingi** (Polish your editing skills) -  Like option B, this is a skill to develop *before* launching your own site, not the launch itself.



"
"Poyambitsa bizinesi yolembera maulendo, ndi luso liti mwa zotsatirazi lomwe liyenera kukonzedwa kaye?","The correct answer is **A: Kulemba nkhani za maulendo (Writing travel articles)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes starting a travel *writing* business and building it up *through* a website.  Before you can *have* a website to showcase your work, you need the *content* – the travel articles. 

Let's look at why the other options are less important *initially*:

* **B: kufufuta pa webusaiti (Website promotion):**  Promotion comes *after* you have something to promote.
* **C: Kukonza (Editing):**  Editing is important, but you need something *to* edit first – the writing.
* **D: Kupanga webusaiti (Website creation):** The passage says you can create a website *later*, once you're comfortable with writing and editing.  It's a subsequent step.

Therefore, writing the travel articles is the foundational skill that needs to be developed first.



"
Ndi nthawi ya nyengo iti yomwe matenda okhudza matumbo amagundika?,"The correct answer is **C: Nyengo yotentha**.

The passage explicitly states: ""mu nyengo yotentha tizilombo ta bakiteriya timakula msanga ndi kupulumuka kwa nthawi yayitali kunja kwa thupi."" This directly links warmer weather to increased bacterial growth and, therefore, a higher risk of intestinal problems.
"
"Mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, kuwirikiza kukhala pa chiopsezo kungadzetse kupilira bwanji kumatenda?","The correct answer is **A: Mavuto okhudza matumbo** (Gastrointestinal issues).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly discusses how different environments (new bacteria, warm weather) lead to illnesses like ""Delhi Belly,"" ""Pharaoh's curse,"" and ""Montezum's revenge,"" all of which are *stomach problems* or issues related to the digestive system. The passage describes these as consequences of exposure to new bacteria and favorable conditions for bacterial growth. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Majeremusi am'deralo** (Local germs) - While the passage mentions germs, it focuses on the *result* of exposure to them (illness), not the germs themselves as the risk.
*   **C: Mavuto akupuma** (Respiratory problems) - The passage doesn't mention anything about breathing or respiratory issues.
*   **D: Delhi Belly** - ""Delhi Belly"" is an *example* of a type of illness, not the general way exposure increases risk of illness.



"
Ubwino woyenda m'dera la Schengen ndi uti mwa zotsatirazi?,"The correct answer is **A: Kupewa kupempha zikalata zolowera dziko lina zambiri** (Avoiding applying for many different country entry documents).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Pokhapokha ngati ukukhala mdera lino, utha kuwoloka malire adziko osafunaso kudzera m'malo mowona ziphaso zolowera ndi kutulukira mdziko."" (Unless you live in this area, you can cross country borders without having to go through places to obtain entry and exit visas.)  This directly relates to avoiding needing multiple documents.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Kupulumutsa ndalama** (Saving money) - While avoiding visas *can* save money, the passage doesn't emphasize cost savings directly, but rather the convenience of avoiding the process.
* **C: Kupewa malo ambiri ofufuzila za chiphaso** (Avoiding many places to inquire about a visa) - This is related to A, but A is the more direct benefit.
* **D: Sozofunika chiphaso choyendela kupita dziko lina** (Not needing a visa to travel to another country) - The passage says you don't need *separate* visas within the Schengen area *if* you have a Schengen visa. It doesn't say you don't need a visa entirely if you're not from the area.



"
Ndi chani chomwe sichingapezeke m'manda a Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Chuma**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chuma chambiri cha m'manda sichilinso m'mandamo, koma chinachotsedwa kupita ku Egyptian Museum ku Cairo."" This directly translates to ""Much of the gold from the tomb is no longer in the tomb, but was removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zokongoletsera zina (Some decorations)** - The text says the tomb *wasn't* heavily decorated, but doesn't say decorations are missing.
*   **B: Mutu wamunthu womwalira kalekale (A human skull)** - The text explicitly mentions the head and limbs are visible.
*   **C: Mapewa lamunthu womwalira kalekale (Human limbs)** - The text explicitly mentions the limbs are visible.

"Malinga ndim'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi malo ati omwe angapangitse apaulendo kukhala chinthu chomaliza kuwasangalatsa kwa apaulendo amene amasamala zamitengo ku dela la Vancouver? ","The correct answer is **C: Chilumba cha Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is known for day trips or weekend getaways with activities like kayaking, hiking, shops, and restaurants. It's also easily accessible from Vancouver and is presented as a destination in itself. This makes it the most likely place to be a highlight for tourists in the Vancouver area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chilumba cha Granville:** While mentioned as a transport hub *to* Bowen Island, it isn't described as a destination with attractions for tourists.
*   **B: Njira yochoka kunyanja kupita kumwamba:** This refers to the Sea to Sky route and is a way to *get* to Whistler, not a destination itself.
*   **D: woimba wiziro:** This is not mentioned in the text.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi malo ati omwe angapatse apaulendo zokumana nazo zenizeni za Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Chilumba cha Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Bowen Island is ""renowned for day trips or weekend getaways"" and offers a variety of activities like kayaking, hiking, shopping, and dining. It's described as easily accessible from Vancouver and providing a real experience of the area (being in Howe Sound near Vancouver).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: woimba wiziro (Whistler)**: While mentioned, it's described as being 1.5 hours from Vancouver and is presented as a separate destination, not a place to directly experience Vancouver itself.
*   **C: Kumunsi kwa tawuni ya Vancouver (Downtown Vancouver)**: The passage doesn't focus on experiences *within* downtown Vancouver.
*   **D: Chilumba cha Granville (Granville Island)**: The passage mentions Granville Island as a *point of departure* (water taxi location) to reach Bowen Island, not as a destination with experiences of its own.



"
"Mmena zafotokozeledwa mndimeyi, ndi nthawi iti imene apaulendo okaona falls angapite ngati sakufuna maonedwe osasokonezedwa ?","The correct answer is **D: Kunja kwa nyengo yanvula**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Munyengo ya mvula (Novembala mpaka Marichi), kuchuluka kwa madzi kumakhala kokwera ndi Mathithi amakhala wosangalatsa. Nzodziwikilatu kuti munyowa ngati muyenda njira yooloka mulatho kapena tinjira tam'mbali mwa mathithi. Pena, nchifukwa chakuti madziwo ndi ambiri moti simudzatha kuona mathithio bwino- chifukwa cha kuchuluka madzi.""
* This means that *during* the rainy season (November to March), the view of the falls is obscured by too much water. 
* Therefore, to get an *unobstructed* view, you would need to visit *outside* the rainy season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Novembala kukathera Malichi (November to March):** This is *when* the view is obstructed.
* **B: Nthawi imene alendo amabwera (When tourists come):** The passage doesn't specify the best time to visit based on tourist volume, only visibility.
* **C: Pamene mulingo wamadzi ndiwokwera (When the water level is high):** This is exactly when the view is worst!



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, pali mwayi wotani wokacheza ku Victoria Falls pakati pa Novembala ndi Marichi?","The correct answer is **C: Maonekedwe oseketsa adziwe** (Spectacular views of the falls).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Munyengo ya mvula (Novembala mpaka Marichi), kuchuluka kwa madzi kumakhala kokwera ndi Mathithi amakhala wosangalatsa."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water is high and the Falls are spectacular.) 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maonekedwe osaoneka bwino a dziwe** (Obscured views of the falls): The passage *does* mention difficulty seeing the falls clearly due to the water, but it doesn't present this as the opportunity, it presents it as a consequence.
*   **B: Alendo ochepa** (Fewer tourists): The passage doesn't mention tourist numbers.
*   **D: Kupewa nthawi yanvula** (Avoiding the rainy season): The question asks about the *opportunity* during this time, not how to avoid it.



"
"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwazosatilazi zomwe sizilimbikitsidwa mukamagwiritsa ntchito tindege tang'ono ting'ono pojambula kanema?","Correct answer is **D: Kujambula kanema m'madera mokhamokha momwe ndi modzdza ndi anthukuti kut tindege tang'ono ting'ono tisaoneke**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that operating a drone near crowds of people is *always* a bad idea, even if legally permitted in your area. This directly corresponds to option D, which describes filming in crowded areas where the drone could be obscured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kufufuza nthawi isanakwane zomwe mukulolezedwa kuti muzajambule keanema wake** - The passage *encourages* checking what you are allowed to film and getting permits if necessary.
*   **B: Kupeza chiphaso choonjezera** - The passage mentions needing ""special permission"" if required, which relates to permits.
*   **C: Zilolezo zakafukufuku** - This is a type of permit and is mentioned as something you *should* do if needed."
"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndimalo ati abwino omwe akhoza kujambula kanema kugwilitsa ntchito tindege tating'onoting'ono?","The correct answer is **D: M'madera momwe mwapeza zilolezo musanapange kanthu** (In areas where you have obtained permits before creating anything).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that if you're using a drone, you ""must scout out what you need to film or special permission if required."" This directly points to the need for permits and prior authorization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Flying near a crowded area is specifically warned *against* in the passage.
*   **B:** The passage mentions areas where photography is prohibited generally, but doesn't suggest those are good places to film with a drone. In fact, it implies the opposite.
*   **C:** The passage doesn’t provide any guidance about areas where a drone is not visible.



"
"Kutengera m'ndimeyi, ndi mfundo iti yonena zzokhudzana ndi kulembetsa kwa chikalata chachilolezo choyendera dziko lina yomwe siyoona?","The correct answer is **A: Ngati mukukhala kumalo ogona alendo, simungafunike kulembetsa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mu nthawi zambiri zina, omwe amakhala kunja kwa malo omwe kuli alendo ayenera kulembetsa."" This directly implies that *if* you are staying in tourist accommodations (malo ogona alendo), you might *not* need to register.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maiko onse amafuna kulembetsa ndi akuluakulu aboma:** The passage says ""m'maiko ena"" (in some countries), not all.
* **C: Kuyendera maofesi olowa ndi kutuluka kungakhale kofunikira:** The passage mentions this as *a possibility*, but it doesn't present it as a general rule.
* **D: M'madera ena, mahotela am'deralo amatha kulembetsa:** The passage states hotels *maintain a register* (kalembera) but doesn't say they *register you* on your behalf.



"
Ndi malo ati otsatirawa omwe alendo angapite kukalembetsa?,"The correct answer is **D: Maofesi a dipatimenti yowona za anthu olowa ndi otuluka**.

The text specifically mentions going to ""ma ofesi owona anthu olowa ndi kutuluka mdziko"" as a place where registration might be required. While the text also mentions registering at a local police station, the immigration offices are more directly related to the general rule described.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wapolisi wakumaloko (Local police)** - The text mentions this as *a* possibility, but it's not the primary or universally required location.
*   **B: Hotelo yomwe akukhala (The hotel they are staying at)** - The text doesn't mention hotels as registration locations.
*   **C: Positi ofesi yapafupi (Nearest post office)** - The text makes no mention of post offices.



"
Ndani sangapindule mwa kudzipereka paulendo?,"The correct answer is **B: Munthu wina kufuna salary yogwirika (Someone wanting a viable salary)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ntchito zina zongothandiza zimaperaka chipinda ndi mayendedwe ndi malipiro wochepa"" which translates to ""some volunteer jobs only offer accommodation and travel and low pay."" This directly contradicts the idea of finding a viable salary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wina amene akuyembekeza kupeza mabwenzi atsopano ali kunja (Someone hoping to make new friends abroad):** The passage says volunteering is a good way to ""kukumana ndi anthu atsopano"" (meet new people).
*   **C: Munthu wina kuyembekezera kupeza luso latsopano (Someone expecting to gain a new skill):** The passage states volunteering can allow you to ""kupeza maluso atsopano"" (gain new skills).
*   **D: Wina akhoza kukhala ndi chidwi ndi chipinda ndi polembapo (Someone might be interested in accommodation and board):** The passage mentions that some volunteer positions *do* provide these things, making it a possibility, not a reason *not* to volunteer.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, kodi kudzipereka uli kudziko lina ndikopindulitsa bwanji kwa woyenda omwe ali ndi ndondomeko yachuma?","The correct answer is **B: Kawirikawiri zimapeleka mwayi wantchito**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It can also be a good way to create a financial plan to be in another place because some volunteer work just covers room and board with little pay."" This directly implies that volunteering can *lead to* work opportunities that offer better financial stability than simply volunteering for room and board.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pafupifupi malipilo amapelekedwa** - The passage states the opposite - some volunteer work has *little* pay.
*   **C: Chipinda ndi polembapo nthawi zina amapeleka** - While true, this is a limitation of *some* volunteer work, not a benefit for someone with a financial plan.
*   **D: Zikhoza kukuthandiza kuti upenze maonekedwe a malingaliro** - While the passage mentions gaining perspective, it doesn't connect this specifically to a financial plan.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani chomwe chingaganizidwe ngati chachilendo paulendo wopita ku Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: Kutaya nthawi yonse ya ulenduwo pa kathundu wa Disney**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a ""typical"" Disney World trip as spending almost a whole week *focused on Disney* – meaning immersed in the Disney experience.  Anything deviating significantly from that would be unusual. Option C describes completely dedicating the trip to Disney itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't mention visiting animal kingdoms as something unusual.
*   **B:** Staying at an off-site rental home isn't presented as unusual, just a deviation from the described typical trip.
*   **D:** Taking a bus from the airport is part of the *typical* trip described in the passage.



"
Ndi mawu ati okhudza Walt Disney World omwe siolondola?,"The correct answer is **A: Matikiti osangalira amatheka kusinthanisa ndi apaoulendo ena**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while tickets are sometimes resold on sites like eBay and Craigslist, these are often partially used and **Disney does not honor transferred tickets**. This directly contradicts the idea that tickets are transferable.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **B: Kupezeka kwamalo ogonako pamalo pompo** - The passage refers to staying at Disney resorts.
*   **C: Pali ma basi otenga athu apaulendo kuchoka ku bwalo lotelera ndege kupita nawo ku malo awo** - The passage specifically states you take a bus from the Orlando airport to Disney accommodations.
*   **D: Matiketi amasiku ambiri kawirikawiri amapezeka pamawebusaiti obetcha** - The passage states tickets are sold on sites like eBay and Craigslist.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nkhani ziti mwa zotsatirazi zomwe sizingachitike m'kalasi yophunzitsa akatswiri kapena m'mabuku osindikizidwa?","The correct answer is **D: Sewero**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that training for hostile environments includes leadership demonstration, first aid training, and *sometimes* weapons handling. It also mentions survival skills are available in books and magazines.
*   The passage specifically contrasts the availability of resources for survival skills with the scarcity of publications detailing combat. This implies that the training focuses on practical skills related to conflict zones.
*   ""Sewero"" (play/games) doesn't fit the serious, tactical nature of the training described in the passage. The passage focuses on preparing individuals for the realities of a war zone, not recreational activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupulumuka mchipululu (Survival in the wilderness)** - The passage states survival skills are readily available in books and magazines.
*   **B: Kukonzekera chithandizo chopeleka nthawi yoyambirira (First aid preparation)** - The passage specifically mentions first aid training as part of the course.
*   **C: Kukonzekera malo ankhondo (Combat preparation)** - The passage explicitly states the training covers aspects of combat, even noting the scarcity of published materials on the subject.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi maphunziro ati otsatirawa omwe angaphunzisidwe kwambiri m'kalasi yophunzitsa akatswiri?","The correct answer is **A: Chithandizo chopeleka nthawi yoyambirira** (First aid).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that training courses often include learning ""kuphunzira zokhala woyambilira pathandizo"" (learning to be a first aider). While the passage mentions survival skills and combat techniques, first aid is explicitly listed as a component of the training. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Malo akhondo** (Combat locations) - The passage suggests researching these online, but doesn't say they are *taught* in the courses.
*   **C: Kupulumuka mchipululu** (Wilderness survival) - The passage notes books and magazines cover this, but it isn't highlighted as a core part of the formal training.
*   **D: Nyengo zaukali** (Severe weather) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, njira yabwino kwambiri yopewera madzi omwe angakhale oipitsidwa ndi iti?","The correct answer is **B: Kugula madzi am'mbotolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ngati muli ndi dandaulo, zigulani madzi omwe ali m'botolo lotseka bwino komaso wochokera ku kampani yodziwika bwino."" ( ""...if you are concerned, purchase bottled water that is well-sealed and from a reputable company."")

This directly recommends buying bottled water as a precaution against contamination. The other options are mentioned in the passage as methods of purification, but aren't presented as the *best* way to avoid potentially contaminated water if you're worried.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, nchiyani chomwe chingakhale chosatheka ngakhale kwa osambira aluso?","The correct answer is **A: Kusambira moyandikana ndi matanthwe** (Swimming close to rip currents).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Imfa zambiri zimachitika chifukwa cha kutopa poyesera kusambira mopikisana ndi madzi, zimene mwina ndizosatheka."" This refers to the struggle against the pull of a rip current, making it potentially impossible *even for skilled swimmers*. The passage describes rip currents as strong and originating from near the shore, and explains that trying to swim directly against them leads to exhaustion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kusambira mmadzi ozama** - While deep water can be dangerous, the passage focuses specifically on the danger of rip currents, not just depth.
*   **C: Kusambira kupita kumbali yochokera madzi** - The passage advises moving parallel to the shore to escape a rip current, not away from it.
*   **D: Kusambira mozungulira mafunde** - The passage doesn't mention swimming around rip currents, it advises getting *out* of them.



"
Kodi muyenera kuchita chiyani mukagwidwa ndi madzi othamanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuyesera kuchokamo mwatsopano potsamira mbali ina, kenako ndi kubwerela ku mtunda.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mukangotuluka kumene kolimbana ndi mafunde posambira, kusambiranso kumakhala kosavuta."" This directly translates to ""Once you're out of the current while swimming, swimming becomes easier.""  The passage implies moving *sideways* to escape the current, then returning to shore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kusambira mwachangu motsutsana ndi pano** (Swimming quickly against the current) - The passage explicitly says this is often *impossible* and leads to exhaustion.
* **C: Kusambira misyana ndi mbali** (Swimming diagonally with the side) - While diagonal swimming can be helpful in some situations, the passage doesn't suggest this as a primary strategy for rip currents.
* **D: Kusambira pansi pa pamwamba** (Swimming under the surface) - This isn't a recommended technique and could be dangerous.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi malo ati abwino ochezera tchuthi omwe kuli nyumba ya chifumu?","The correct answer is **C: Muchigwa cha Rhine**.

The passage specifically mentions visiting chateaux (castles/manor houses, often translated as ""royal residences"") in the Loire Valley *and* the Rhine Valley. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mzina pamodzi ndi Danube:** The passage mentions enjoyable cities on the Danube, but not royal residences specifically.
* **B: Pafupi ndi Erie Canal:** The Erie Canal is mentioned for boat trips, not royal residences.
* **D: Moyandikana ndi kumtunda kodutsila madzi:** This is too vague; the passage mentions *specific* rivers, not just waterways in general.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ndi iti mwa zotsatirazi yomwe singakhale nsonga yovomerezeka kwa amayi omwe akuyenda m'derali?","The correct answer is **A: Pewani kukambirana za m'banja**.

Here's why:

The passage *encourages* women traveling alone to *state* they are married, even if they aren't. This directly contradicts the idea of avoiding talking about family. 

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **B: Dziwani kuti kusiyana kwa zikhalidwe kungayambitse khalidwe lokakamiza kuchokera kwa anthu ammudzi** - The text explicitly states ""kusiyana pachikhalidwe kungathe kubweletsa zomwe tingati ndi nkhaza ndipo sikawirikawiri kulondedwa , ndikugwilidwa nkono, ndi zina zotero."" (cultural differences can lead to harassment and worse).
*   **C: Pewani kuvala zodzikongoletsera zonyezimira** - The text advises against wearing a very expensive-looking ring (""osati yomwe ikuwoneka kuti ndiyamtengo wapatali kwambiri"").
*   **D: Gwiritsani mphavu ngati kuli kofunikira kutero** - The text says ""Mudzitsindika pokana amuna, ndipo musamaope, mudziyima chiliri"" (be firm in refusing men, and don't be afraid, stand your ground).

Therefore, avoiding talking about family is the only option that doesn’t align with the advice given in the passage."
"Kutengera ndi gawo lomwe lafotokozedwa m'ndimeyi, ndi malangizo ati omwe angakhale othandiza kwa amayi apaulendo?","The correct answer is **A: Zindikirani kuti si zachilendo kutsatiridwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""...kusiyana pachikhalidwe kungathe kubweletsa zomwe tingati ndi nkhaza ndipo sikawirikawiri kulondedwa , ndikugwilidwa nkono, ndi zina zotero."" This directly translates to ""cultural differences can attract unwanted attention and being followed, etc.""  Therefore, being aware of the possibility of being followed is crucial advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Valani mphete yayikulu yosonyeza kuti muli pa banja:** The passage says to wear a ring, but specifically advises *against* a very expensive-looking one.
* **C: Kunvetsetsa zikhalidwe zosiyana kumasonyeza kuti umapewa kuganiza zaiwe mwini:** The passage doesn't suggest that understanding differences means avoiding self-thought. It emphasizes respecting them to *avoid* problems.
* **D: Mukhani yopangidwa zinthu zimenesukufuna, kumakhala olimba powakana amuna:** While the passage encourages standing your ground with men, it doesn't mention specific clothing choices.



"
"Kutengera ndimeyi, ndi nkhani iti yomwe ingafune kuti wojambula nyama zakuthengo agwiritse ntchito kamela yapadera?","The correct answer is **A: Ngati akutola zithunzi makamak za zolengedwa zing'onozing'ono**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...*mbalame ndi zolengedwa zina zing'onozingono zimafuna ma lens amitundu ina*."" This means special cameras (specifically lenses) are needed to photograph small creatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage mentions profit motives as a reason for park regulations, but doesn't say a special camera is *required* if photographers are being paid.
* **C:** The passage states animals can be shy, but that doesn't necessitate a special camera.
* **D:** The passage mentions rules about photography in reserves, but again, doesn't link this to needing a special camera.



"
Ndi ziti mwa izi zomwe sizinatchulidwe m'ndimeyi ngati zovuta kwa ojambula nyama zakuthengo?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuthana ndi nyama zaukali (Dealing with dangerous animals)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions:**
    * Difficulty finding some animals (related to A)
    * The need for specific lenses (related to C - ""ma lens amitundu ina"")
    * Challenging environmental conditions (related to D - ""kozizira, kotentha kapenanso osati kwabwino"")
    * The shyness and elusiveness of the animals.

* **The passage *does not* mention** dealing with dangerous or aggressive animals as a specific challenge for wildlife photographers. While animals can be unpredictable, the text focuses on the difficulty of *finding* and *capturing* them, not their potential for harm.



"
Ndi ziti mwa zotsatirazi zomwe zingabweretse mavuto ochepa kwa dalaivala wodutsa m'misewu yamapiri?,"The correct answer is **B: Kukhulana kochepa** (Low traction).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pa misewu ya m'madzi wowuma ndi chipale , kukhulana ndikochepa ndipo mutha kuyenda ngati kuti muli mu nsewu wina uliwonse."" This directly indicates that low traction is *less* problematic on dry or paved mountain roads.  It's a normal condition you can adjust to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Magalimoto ochuluka achiimile** (Many cars stopped) - This would *create* a problem, not be a condition the driver is prepared for.
* **C: Kusungunuka kwa madzi kwambiri** (Excessive water release) - The passage specifically warns about hydroplaning (""madzi oundanawa atha kugwa nthawi iliyonse womwe angakulepheretseni kuyenda""). This is a danger.
* **D: Kuona kovutikila/chifunga** (Difficulty seeing/fog) - The passage highlights that visibility can be impaired by rain, spray, or fog on the windshield, making it a hazard.



"
Ndi chiyani chomwe chingakhale chokhazikika pamisonkho ya ndalama m'maiko osiyanasiyana?,"The correct answer is **B: Kapangidwe (Structure)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Msonkho umene umaperekedwa pa ndalama zimene anthu apeza umapangidwa **mosiyanasiyana** m'maiko osiyanaso...""  This directly relates to the *structure* or *system* of taxation.  The way taxes are designed (what is taxed, how much, and how it's collected) varies from country to country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: chiongola dzanja kapena mtengo (hand or price):** This doesn't relate to the overarching system of taxation. It's too specific.
* **C: Kumene wakasunga (where you keep it):** While location *can* influence taxes (as the passage mentions different regions within countries), it's the underlying tax *structure* that determines how location matters.
* **D: Mkutila mawu (words):** This is nonsensical in the context of taxation.



"
"Malinga ndi ndimeyi, ngati mukugwira ntchito kutsidya lina la dziko koma kukhazikika kwina, Kodi mungamakhome kuti msonkho wa ndalama zomwe mumapeza?","The correct answer is **C: Mudziko limene panthawi imene ukugwira ntchito**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""kugwira ntchito kunja kwa dziko lanu kukutanthauza kuti muyenera kupereka msonkho pazomwe mukupeza **mdziko lomwe mulimo**."" (working outside your country means you must pay tax on what you earn **in the country where you work**).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kulikonse kumene mumakhalira** - The passage doesn't say taxes are based on residence, but on *where the work is done*.
*   **B: Ku dziko la Amelika** - The passage mentions the US as an example of a country with varying tax rates, but doesn't say taxes are *always* paid there.
*   **D: Pamene ndalama zofunika kulipira ndi zochepetsetsa** - This is irrelevant to where taxes are paid.

Tiyeni tiyang'ane zifukwa zomwe zimatipangitsa kuti tisayankhe zoyambirira:

*   **B: Zionetsero za zomera zimaonetseleredwa m'mbali mwa zionetsero za luso ndi zamaphunziro** - Mlemba umati International Horticultural Expositions (zionetsero za zomera) ndi zochitika zapadera zomwe zili m'mbali mwa chiwonetsero cha Padziko Lonse.
*   **C: Zionetsero zikhoza kuchitika mpaka miyezi isanu ndi umodzi** - Mlemba umati zochitika izi ""zimakhalapo kulikonse pakati miyezi yitatu ndi isanu ndi umodzi.""



"
Ndi iti mwa zotsatirazi yomwe ili lamulo la World's Fair kapena International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **B: Dziko limodzimodzi singamangopanga zochitika chaka ndi chaka**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states: ""Ngakhale kuti nkulingalira nkotheka kupangika chaka ndi chaka (bola zichitike maiko osiyanasiyana), koma sizingatheke kutero."" This directly translates to ""Although it might seem possible to be organized yearly (as long as it happens in different countries), it is not possible to do so.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While Expos *can* showcase a country's history and global issues, it's not a rule. They cover a broad range of topics.
*   **C:** The passage says Expos last *between* three and six months, not specifically six months.
*   **D:** The passage doesn’t state that *all* countries must participate; it says ""Mayiko amene akutenga nawo mbali..."" (""Countries that participate..."") which implies participation is optional.



"
Ndikupanga chani mwazosatirazi komwe kungachepetse kuthekera ko chita chiwembu chinyama?,"The correct answer is **C: Kusunga mtunda okwanira ma yadi makumi awiri ndi asanu ku mimbulu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Khalani patali mtunda osachepera ma yadi kapena mamita 25 pamene pali nyama zina zakutchire!"" This directly relates to maintaining a safe distance from wildlife, including moose (mimbulu).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kunyamula zitsamba za chikondi** - This is irrelevant to preventing animal attacks.
*   **B: Kuchosa zinyalala ku malo amisasa** - This would *attract* animals and increase the risk of encounters.
*   **D: Kuletsa zinyama kudya zakudya za nyenyeswa** - While avoiding feeding wildlife is good practice, the passage focuses on the attraction of *scents* (like mushrooms) to animals, not intentionally feeding them.



"
Ndi ziti mwa zotsatirazi zomwe sizinatchulidwe m'ndimeyi kuti zingayambitse kuukira kwa nyama zakuthengo?,"The correct answer is **A: Fungo lamphavu**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""dziwani kuti fungo limayitana zimbalangondo ndi nyama zinaso, choncho pewani kutenga kapena kuphika zakudya za fungo"" - This means *any* smell (including mushroom smell) can attract wildlife, not specifically mushroom smell.
*   **B: Kulephela kusunga mtunda woyenera** - The passage explicitly states that failing to maintain a safe distance is a cause of attacks.
*   **C: Kudyetsa nyama zachilengedwe** - Although not directly mentioned, the passage's warning against disturbing the animals implies that feeding them would also be dangerous.
*   **D: Nyama zomwe sizidziwana ndi anthu** - The passage emphasizes that the animals are wild, large, and potentially dangerous *regardless* of their familiarity with humans.

Therefore, the passage does **not** specifically mention mushroom smell as a trigger for attacks, only smell in general."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyo, kodi ndi chiyani chomwe simungaganizire kukhala langizo lofunikira pofuna kuyimba kodiyoni?","The correct answer is **C: Wonetsesani kuti mukutobwanya mabatani ndipo mukufewetsa mkono wanu**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kumbukirani sikoyenera kugunda mabatani mwamphamvu zochuluka..."". This means *avoid* hitting the buttons hard and frequently. Option C describes doing just that (hitting the buttons and tiring your arm).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage *does* mention using force with the bellows to increase volume.
*   **B:** The passage advises keeping your wrist loose to avoid fatigue.
*   **D:** The passage *does* state that using the bellows with strength or a change is how you increase volume on an accordion.



"
"Kodi pamene mukusewera kodiyoni, ndiziti mwa izi zomwe zingakuthandizeni kuwonjezera voluyumu?","The correct answer is **B: Mphamvu zambiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuti mukweze volume pa accordion, umagwiritsa ntchito bellows ndi **mphamvu** ndithu kapena changu."" This directly translates to ""To increase the volume on the accordion, you use the bellows and **strength** indeed or gradually.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuthamangitsa kwambiri (Moving quickly)** - The passage focuses on *how* you apply force, not speed.
* **C: Mphamvu zochepa (Little strength)** - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.
* **D: Kuchepetsa kuyenda kwa chala (Reducing finger movement)** - The passage advises against excessive finger movement, but doesn't link it to volume.



"
Kodi nchifukwa chiyani zithunzi pakanema zimakhala m’mbali modula?,"The correct answer is **B: Choncho zinthuzi zithe kuzaza kanema yense** (So that these things can fill the entire screen).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the reason for cropping (dula mbali, pamwamba, pansi, m'mbali) is ""pofuna kuti chithunzi chikwanire galasi lonse"" - to make the image fit the entire screen.  This is what overscan is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuti zithe kukhala ndi mitu ing’onoing’ono** - The text doesn't mention anything about small titles.
*   **C: Pofuna kuti zithe kusinthidwa mosavuta kupita ku mitundu ina ya zithunzi** -  The passage focuses on fitting the image to the screen, not converting formats.
*   **D: Pofuna kudula mitu ing’onoing’ono yoyandikira kwambiri pansi** - The passage explains that titles *might* be cut off *because* of the cropping, not that the cropping is *to* cut off titles.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi vuto liti lamavuta awa lomwe wina angakomane nalo pamene akusintha filimu kuti ikhale mumtundu wa DVD?","The correct answer is **D: M’mbali moduka** (Cut off edges).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that when converting a film to DVD, the edges are also cut off due to overscan.  If the original film had text or important visuals near the edges, they won't appear on the DVD.  This directly relates to ""m'mbali moduka"" – edges being cut off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chinthunzi chomwe sichikuzaza kanema yense** (An image that doesn't fill the whole screen) – The passage describes overscan *making* the image fill the screen, not the opposite.
*   **B: Mitu ing’onoing’no yomwe ndiyodukako** (Small heads that are pixelated) – This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Chinthunzi chomwe chikuzaza kanema yense** (An image that fills the whole screen) – While overscan *aims* for this, the problem is what gets *lost* in the process (the edges).



"
Kodi galizoni ya angerezi inali kuti?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku Trenton**.

Here's why:

The passage states that James Ewing landed troops to cut off the enemy from escaping *over the creek near Trenton*.  It also mentions a large force dividing to prepare an attack *near Trenton*. This indicates Trenton was the primary target and therefore where the British garrison was located.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku Kwawa la Assunpink:** The Assunpink Creek is mentioned as a geographical feature, not the location of the garrison.
*   **C: Ku Bordentown:** General Cadwalder attacked the British *at* Bordentown, but the main operation was focused on Trenton.
*   **D: Ku Princeton:** Princeton isn't mentioned in the passage in relation to the garrison's location.



"
Kodi adasayinira pa chikalata cholemba ndimanjachi ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **D: A Charles Thomson**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...written in manuscript and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock **and secretary Charles Thomson** were sent to be printed...""

This clearly identifies Charles Thomson as one of the individuals who signed the handwritten document.



"
"Kodi m’malo awa,a Dunlap adafikila kuti komaliza?","The correct answer is **C: Ku London**.

The passage states: ""Kope ina inafika ku London pa 10 Ogasiti."" (Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.) This indicates that London was the final destination mentioned in the text.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku New York** - New York is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Malo otsindikizira a Dunlap** - The broadsides were *printed* at Dunlap's shop, but it wasn't the final destination.
*   **D: Ku Indipendesi Holo** - The Declaration was first read aloud at Independence Hall, but it wasn't the final destination of a copy.



"
Kodi asilikali osogozedwa ndi Kolonelo Sitaki adali mbali iti?,"The correct answer is **A: Kumapeto chakumpoto, m’mbali mwa mpanda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amuna a gulu la Stark anayandikira pafupi ndi mpanda chakumpoto kwa Colonist."" This directly translates to ""The men of Stark's group approached near the northern end of the Colonist's breastwork.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pa gombe m’mbali mwa madzi** - The text mentions they extended the breastwork *to* the water's edge, but doesn't say Stark's men were *on* the beach.
*   **C: M’mbali mwa chisumbu cha kumpoto kum’mawa** - The text doesn't describe a north-south axis or a ""center.""
*   **D: Kutsogolo kwa mpanda** - The text says they were *near* the breastwork, and a strong picket was placed *in front* of the breastwork, suggesting they weren't directly in front of it.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi lidali liti asilikali wosogozedwa ndi a Sitaki adawonjezera mpanda?","The correct answer is **C: Pamene mafunde adali ocheperako**.

The text states: ""Pamene mafunde otsika adatsegula mpata m'mbalim'mbali mwamtsinje wa Mystic..."" which directly translates to ""When the low tides opened a gap in the side of the Mystic River..."" and then continues, ""...mwamsangamsanga adaonjezera kukulitsa mpanda..."" meaning ""immediately they began to expand the rampart.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pamene atsamunda adayitanitsa kuwonjezera mphamvu zina** - While Atsamunda did call for reinforcements, the text doesn't say this *caused* the rampart to be expanded. It happened *concurrently* with the low tide.
*   **B: Pamene anthu anadutsa mulingo** - The text mentions a line not being crossed *until* people had passed, but doesn't say the rampart was expanded *when* people passed.
*   **D: Pamene asilikali adakhala malo apatsogolo** - They were already in a forward position. The expansion of the rampart happened because of the tide, not because they reached a forward position.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nthawi iti mwanthawizi zomwe dziko la China lidali mu ulamuliro wa nkhanza kwambiri?","Correct answer: **D: Munthawi ya maufumu atatu**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Three Kingdoms period was a time of ""fierce warfare involving a large number of honorable people fighting for the throne"" and that one of those kingdoms ""shed blood in ancient Chinese history, with tens of thousands losing their lives fighting for the throne in the capital city of Xi'an."" This describes a period of extreme violence and struggle for power, which equates to a cruel/oppressive time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mu ufumu wa Jini:** The passage mentions the Jin dynasty *after* the Three Kingdoms period, implying it brought an end to the chaos, not that it was the most cruel time.
*   **B: Munthawi ya Xi’an:** Xi’an is mentioned as the location of the imperial court, but the passage doesn't say Xi'an itself was a cruel time, just that the fighting for the throne happened *near* Xi'an.
*   **C: Mu ufumu wa Hani:** The Three Kingdoms period occurred *between* the Han and Jin dynasties, suggesting the Han dynasty didn’t represent the most cruel time.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, zowona nziti pa gulu la nkhondo la nyerere pamene likulowa gawo loyendayenda?","The correct answer is **C: Zimapanga zisa zomwe zimasinthidwa pakapita masiku 17**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Munthawi imeneyi zimapanga zitsa zoyembekezera za tsiku ndi tsiku. Ina iliyonse yamayendedwe oterewa kapena mayendedwe omatenga pafupifupi masiku 17."" This directly translates to ""During this time they make daily forecasts. Each of these journeys takes approximately 17 days."" This means the forecasts are updated/changed roughly every 17 days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zimapanga zitsa nthawi ya usiku** - The passage states they travel at night, not *make* forecasts at night.
* **B: Zimakhala ndi zakudya zochepa** - The passage says they *go* to find food when it's low, but doesn't state they start the journey with little food.
* **D: Zimayenda nthawi ya masana** - The passage explicitly says they *stop to build nests* during the day, meaning they don't travel then.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nkhani iti yomwe ikufotokoza molondola khalidwe lomanga zitsa la gulu la asilikali la nyerere pamene zili pa nthawi yoyendayenda?","The correct answer is **C: Zimasintha zisa tsiku lililonse**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Munthawi imeneyi zimapanga zitsa zoyembekezera za tsiku ndi tsiku."" This translates to ""During this time, they create expected campsites daily."" This directly means they change campsites every day.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zimapanga zisa nthawi ya usiku** - While they *travel* at night, they *build* campsites during the day.
*   **B: Zimayenda moguba kwa masiku 17 koma osamanga zisa** - The passage explicitly states they *do* build campsites.
*   **D: Zimagwiritsa zisa zomwezo pa nthawi yonse yoyendayenda** - The passage states they change campsites *daily*, meaning they don't use the same one for the whole journey.



"
Ndiziti mwaizi zimene zingapitilire ngakhale popanda chidziwitso chowoneka?,"The correct answer is **A: Zochitika mkati mwamatupi (Internal processes)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes behaviors that continue even without external stimuli.** This strongly suggests processes happening *within* the organism, driving the behavior, rather than being *caused* by something external.  The passage explicitly mentions this happening across many life forms (bacteria, plants, animals) – all of which have internal biological processes.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Zochitika mobwereza (External events):** The passage specifically contrasts these behaviors *with* responses to external stimuli.
    * **C: Kusintha mawonekedwe a chinthu (Changes in appearance):** While internal processes can *cause* changes in appearance, the passage focuses on the behavior itself, not what you see.
    * **D: Zowoneka mobwereza (External appearances):** Similar to C, this refers to observable traits, not the driving forces behind the behavior.



The passage’s key point is the existence of innate, self-sustaining biological rhythms and behaviors driven by internal mechanisms."
Kodi ndichiyani chimene chimaonetsa kusiyana kwa zinthu malingana ndi chikhalidwe chamaonekedwe ake?,"The correct answer is **D: Kukhala ndi mawonenedwe awiri kapena angapo osiyana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines polymorphism as showing multiple forms of characteristics.** This directly corresponds to having two or more different appearances.
* **Option A** describes a monomorphic state (unchanging appearance), which is the *opposite* of what the question is asking about.
* **Option B** is too broad – simply ""living things"" doesn't explain the difference in *appearance*.
* **Option C** is also too broad - a group of living things doesn’t necessarily explain differences in appearance.

Kodi ndi chiyani mwaizi chomwe sichingakhale chitsanzo chachilengedwe cha ntchito zokopa alendo?,"The correct answer is **D: Kupha nsomba poweza ndi mbeza yopukusa (Killing fish with dynamite and a spear)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on appreciating and learning about nature.** Activities like hiking, birdwatching, and observing wildlife are all about enjoying the natural world responsibly.
* **Option D is destructive and harmful to the environment.** Killing fish with dynamite and a spear is not a respectful or sustainable activity and directly contradicts the spirit of nature-based tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are suitable:

* **A: Kuyenda kupita ku mathithi (Hiking to mountains)** - A classic nature activity.
* **B: Kujambula maluwa akutchire (Painting wildflowers)** -  Combines art with appreciating natural beauty.
* **C: Kupita kumalo osungira zinthu zakalekale za sayansi (Visiting a science museum)** - While not *directly* nature, museums often have exhibits on natural history and can foster learning about the environment.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi nchiyani mwaizi chomwe ndi maziko a dongosolo la mayendedwe?","The correct answer is **A: Malo wopitako kukagwilira ntchito** (Place of work).

Here's why:

The passage begins by describing people *leaving small towns to go to work* and passing by you on their way. This establishes the commute to work as the foundational reason for the transportation system.  The entire discussion of transportation methods and environmental impact stems from this basic need to get people *to* their jobs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Galimoto zomwe ndiza anthu (Vehicles for people):**  The passage mentions vehicles as a *solution* or a type of transportation being discussed, not as the reason the system exists.
* **C: Malo okhazikika a zamoyo (Established habitats):** While the passage brings up the impact on the environment, the environment isn't the *basis* of the transportation system, it's affected *by* it.
* **D: Kusintha kwa anthu (Migration of people):** While people moving is part of the scenario, the *reason* for needing transport is the daily commute *to work*, not the initial move itself.



"
Gawo lamu nyukiliyasi limene limazungulira nyukiliyasi lili ndi mphamvu yanji?,"The correct answer is **C: Mphamvu yochotsera** (Negative charge).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ma electron ali ndi vuto la magetsi.""  ""Vuto"" in this context translates to ""charge,"" and specifically a negative charge. Protons have positive charge, and neutrons have no charge. Therefore, the particles orbiting the nucleus (electrons) have a negative charge.



"
Nyukiliyasi ili ndi magawo otani?,"The correct answer is **A: Ma Pulotoni ndima nyutiloni** (Protons and neutrons).

The text explicitly states: ""Nucleus ili ndizinthu ziwiri - ma neutron ndi ma proton."" (The nucleus consists of two things - neutrons and protons).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ma Nyutiloni ndima elekitiloni** (Neutrons and electrons) - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **C: Ma Elekitiloni ndima pulotoni** (Electrons and protons) - Electrons orbit the nucleus, they are *not* inside it.
* **D: Ma Pulotoni, ma nyutiloni, ndima elekitiloni** (Protons, neutrons, and electrons) - Electrons are not part of the nucleus.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi pamndandanda uwu ndi chitsanzo chiti chimene ndi cha chisanu cha nambala ya bit binary?","The passage states that a binary number consists of only one of two things: 0 or 1. Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: 1010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **B: 12001** - Contains the number 2, which is not a binary digit.
*   **C: 10010** - Contains only 0s and 1s.
*   **D: 110101** - Contains only 0s and 1s.

The question asks for a *binary* number, meaning it can only contain 0s and 1s. Options B is incorrect as it contains '2'. However, the question asks for the fifth item, and doesn't specify which item in a list we are looking at. As such, we must assume the question is asking which is a valid binary number.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: 1010** (or C or D, as they are all valid binary numbers, but A is simplest).

"
Ma digit a binary amadziwikaso ngati chiyani?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabiti**.

The passage explicitly states: ""pamene tikugwilitsa ntchito mawu apakompuyuta. manambala amenewa amatchedwa kuti binary digits - kapena kuti ma bit..."" which directly translates to ""these numbers are called binary digits - or bits...""
"
Kodi ndi china mwaziti chimene sichinanenedwe mundimemu ngati chofunikira kopambana pamane ana asukulu akugwiritsa ntchito ukadaulo wamakono osinthana zinthu mwaluso?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuchepetsa zotsutsa kuchokera kwa azathu (Reducing criticism from peers)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *positive* effects of blogging for students:** improved writing skills, critical thinking, collaboration, and expanding knowledge. It mentions the initial fear of criticism *leading* to better writing, but doesn't state that *reducing* criticism is a key benefit itself. In fact, the passage suggests facing potential criticism is a motivator.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: Kulimbikira kudziwa chilankhulo komanso kulemba (Striving to know language and writing):** The passage explicitly states blogging helps with writing skills (""kuphunzila kulemba"") and encourages careful writing to avoid criticism.
* **C: Kukulitsa chidziwitso cha malo okhalapo (Expanding awareness of surroundings):** The passage says blogging ""kumalimbikitsa ophunzira kuchenjera kudziwa bwino zomwe zawazungulira"" (encourages students to become wise about what surrounds them).
* **D: Kukhala ndi chilakolako chofuna kupitilira kumphunzira (Having a desire to continue learning):**  The passage states blogging encourages learning beyond the classroom (""kuwonjezera zophunzira kupitilira zomwe amaphunzira m'makalasi awo"").



"
Kodi ndi zina mwaziti zofunikira pa ukadaulo wosinthana zinthu zimene zimapeleka chikoka kwa ana a sukulu kulimbikira malembedwe abwino?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulimbikitsa zofuna za anthu owonera** (Encouraging the desires of the audience).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pakuti ophunzira nthawi zambiri ndiwomwe amakhala omvera zimenezi, wolemba ma Blog amayamba kuyesa kuchita bwino zolemba zake popewa chidzudzulo."" This directly indicates that the awareness of an audience (readers) motivates students to improve their writing to avoid criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuyankha pafupipafupi ku zochitika pa makina a intaneti** (Responding frequently to events on the internet) - While blogging involves online interaction, the passage doesn't focus on *speed* of response but the *presence* of an audience.
* **B: Kuthandizira kuchepetsa zotsutsana** (Helping to reduce conflicts) -  The passage doesn't mention conflict resolution.
* **D: Pofunika migwirizano** (Demanding agreements) - The passage highlights encouraging critical thinking and expressing opinions, not necessarily seeking agreement.



"
Kodi ndi chani mwa izi sizili zaphindu pa kulumikizana kosagwirizana kwa ophunzira?,"The correct answer is **B: Kukumama ndi alangizi maso ndi maso nthawi ina ili yonse pa tsiku.**

Here's why:

The passage *contrasts* asynchronous learning with traditional face-to-face interaction, stating students *don't* have to wait for in-person meetings to ask questions.  Asynchronous learning reduces the need for constant face-to-face time.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Kugwiritsa ntchito makina a intaneti ngati chida** - The passage directly states the use of the internet and websites is beneficial.
*   **C: Nthawi yomasuka yogwira ntchito** - The passage mentions flexibility in work schedules as a benefit.
*   **D: Mayendedwe abwino** - While not explicitly stated as ""mayendedwe abwino,"" the flexibility and access to information from anywhere imply convenience and easier access.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi zina mwaziti zosafunika kuchitikira pamodzi polumikizana ndi ana a sukulu?","The correct answer is **D: Magwiritsidwe ntchito a Intaneti**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that using the internet and websites helps school creators have access to more information at any time, and allows students to ask teachers questions at any time and expect quick responses. This highlights the importance of internet usage in school communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mamphuzilidwe abwino (Good discipline)** - The passage doesn't mention discipline.
*   **B: Maola ogwilira ntchito (Working hours)** - While the passage mentions flexible working hours are *possible*, it doesn't present them as essential for connecting with students.
*   **C: Zida zopangira malangizo (Instructional materials)** - The passage doesn't focus on the materials themselves, but rather the *way* information is accessed and communicated.

Kodi ndichiyani chomwe sichidatchulidwe mu ndimeyi ngati chomwe chimathekera kugwirizana ndi nyumba zachifumu kalekale?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndende za pansi panyumba yachifumu**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on feelings of battles, feasts, Arthurian legends, and the overall atmosphere of historical conflict associated with castles. It mentions potential sounds of war and the feeling of dread. Options B, C, and D all directly relate to these themes:

*   **B: Masewero omenyana ndi lupanda a anthu awiri omwe akwera kavalo** (Jousting tournaments) - This aligns with feasts and the chivalric culture.
*   **C: Gulu la asilikali lachifumu** (A royal troop of soldiers) - Directly relates to the war imagery.
*   **D: Asilikali achifumu** (Royal soldiers) - Also connects to war and conflict.

However, the passage *doesn't* mention anything about dungeons or underground prisons. While castles often *had* dungeons, it's not part of the imagery or feelings described in the provided text. Therefore, it's the option least likely to be associated with the passage's content.



"
Kodi ndichiyani chomwe sichidatchulidwe mu ndimeyi ngati fungo kapena kumveka kwaphokoso chomwe chingawoneke ngati chamatsenga pakati pa manyumba achifumu ophwasulidwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ziboda**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions feeling the **smell and sounds of battles**, **feelings of dread and fear**, and alludes to **feasts** within the castles. It focuses on sensory experiences related to war, emotion, and social events. 

**Ziboda (ghosts)** are *not* mentioned as a potential sensation or sound within the ruined castles. The passage frames the feelings as stemming from historical events and imagination, not supernatural presence.



"
Kodi ndi chiti mwaizi chomwe chafotokozeredwa molondola pa Nyumba Yachifumu ya Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **B: Idafunika chitetezo chochepa chifukwa cha mtendere womwe udalipo mu dziko mo pa nthawi yomwe imamangidwa.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mu chaka cha 1480, pamene adayamba kumanga ndi Lord Hastings, dzikolo lidaliko la mtendere ndipo chitetezo chimafunikira mu timagulu toyendayenda tochepa ta upandu."" This directly supports the idea that less security was needed due to the peaceful state of the country when the castle was built.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say the walls were built *by* Lord Hastings, only that he *began* construction when the country was peaceful.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't discuss the castle's fame, only its security features relative to other castles.
*   **D:** The passage says the castle was *less* fortified than a true castle, meaning it wasn't intended to withstand long sieges."
Kodi ndiziti mwaizi zaluso zomwe zidamangidwa pa nyumba yachifumu ya Kirby Muxloe zomwe ndizoziwika munthawi imeneyo zomwe zafotokozeredwa mu ndimeyi?,"Correct answer: **A: Mazenera akuluakulu**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""**Mazenela akuluakulu komanso makoma owonda sadakalimba ndi nkhondo ya adani kwanthawi yaitali.**"" This translates to ""Large windows and thin walls did not withstand enemy attack for a long time."" Therefore, large windows were a feature of the castle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Maziko omangidwa pofuna kuteteza ku achifwamba** - The passage doesn't mention anything about foundations or defenses against bandits specifically.
*   **C: Ili ndi zotetezera zochepa kusiyana ndi nyumba zina zachifumu** - The passage says it was *more* secure than a regular house, not less secure than other castles.
*   **D: Zipupa zochepa phapha** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the thickness of the walls, only that they were *thin*."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi chiti chimene chingakhale chofunika kwambiri pamene munthu ochita masewero othamanga akukozekera kuyamba kwa mpikisano?","The correct answer is **B: Kuyika chidwi pa mathamangidwe oyenera nthawi ya zokozekera.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndichoncho wothamanga wa gawo loyamba wothamanga theka la mayilosi, munthu yemwe amakwanitsa osapitilira mphindi ziwiri, ayenera kukhala ndi liwiro labwino, koma akhale wopilira kunyengo zonse."" This emphasizes the importance of **patience and good pacing** (not just speed) especially in the initial phase of the race.  ""Mathamangidwe oyenera"" translates to ""good pacing"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukonzekera masewero othamanga a dziko lonse munyengo yotentha** - The passage doesn't mention international races or hot weather.
* **C: Kupambana nthawi ya mphindi zitatu** - The passage specifies a target of *under two minutes* for the first half mile, not three minutes.
* **D: Kugwiritsa ntchito malo othandizira kulimbitsa thupi** - While the passage mentions training exercises (""masewero olimbitsa thupi""), it doesn't specifically focus on *location* for those exercises.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi chiti chimene chili chopambana kwambiri kwa katswiri othamanga mamailosi atheka?","The correct answer is **B: Kuyika chidwi pakupilira osati kuthamanga**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""liwiro silimakhala lofunikira kwambiri koma kupilira ndiko kumafunika kwenikweni."" (speed is not very important, but endurance is really necessary). This emphasizes that endurance is the most important quality for a half-mile runner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention training in cold weather.
* **C:** While finishing under two minutes is good, the passage says it's for the *first part* of the race and focuses on needing a *good speed* and *endurance* to do so. It doesn't say it's the most important thing overall.
* **D:** This is the opposite of what the passage states - it prioritizes speed over endurance.



"
"Kwa munthu ochita masewero olimbitsa thupi, kodi ndi chiyani mwa izi zomwe sizingakwanilitsidwe kudzera madyedwe abwino?","The correct answer is **A: Kulimbikira kugwira ntchito (Motivation to work)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) focuses on *how* to improve performance and enjoyment through techniques and understanding.** It talks about healthy habits regarding desire, and understanding different aspects of training.  It doesn't suggest diet *creates* motivation. Motivation is an internal factor.
* **B: Kuwonjezera chisangalaro (Increasing enjoyment)** - The passage directly states that understanding different aspects of training can *increase enjoyment*.
* **C: Zotsatira zabwino (Good results)** - The passage says techniques can help athletes *change their performance and increase enjoyment*, implying better results.
* **D: Thanzi labwino (Good health)** -  The passage begins by mentioning staying healthy and strong. Diet is fundamental to good health.

Therefore, while diet is crucial for results, health, and even enjoyment, it *cannot* directly instill motivation. Motivation comes from within.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi ziti zimene sizinayelekezedwe ngati njira yakuti othamanga achichepera apeze chisangalaro chichikulu mumasewelowa?","The correct answer is **B: Kugwira modzipeleka kwa mtengo wapatali (Committing to a long-term goal)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) mentions:

* **Kudya moyenela (Eating properly/nutritiously)** - relating to option A.
* **Kumwa moyenera (Drinking appropriately/hydrating)** - relating to option C.
* **Kuti ukhalebe wa thanzi lamphamvu (Staying healthy and strong)** - relating to option D.
* **Makhalidwe abwino othanirana ndi ludzu (Good habits relating to desire/motivation)** - this refers to mindset and discipline, but *not* specifically a long-term goal.

The passage focuses on *how* to improve performance and enjoyment through diet, hydration, and mindset, but it **doesn't explicitly mention setting long-term goals** as a way to increase enjoyment in sports.  Therefore, option B is the element *not* highlighted in the passage.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, chifukwa chiyani othamanga masewera olimbitsa thupi a mtunda wapakati kati akhoza kugula katundu odula ochitira masewerowa?","The correct answer is **A: Ndizimene amakonda** (They just want to).

Here's why:

The passage states that athletes ""may feel the desire for something even if the item doesn't actually improve performance."" This directly translates to buying items because they *want* them, not because they provide a tangible benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zili ndi phindu lodziwikiratu** (It has a clear benefit) - The passage explicitly says many items have little to no effect on performance.
*   **C: Zizakhuza kwambiri zotsatira zawo** (It will greatly affect their results) - The passage states the opposite; the impact is minimal or nonexistent.
*   **D: Pali maganizidwe olakwika okhuza zida zotsika mtengo** (There are misconceptions about inexpensive equipment) - While the passage mentions inexpensive gear, it's not about misconceptions, but about the desire *despite* knowing the gear isn't essential.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi masewero othamanga mtunda wapakatikati amafuna chiyani?","The correct answer is **C: Zida zochepa kwambiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Kuthamanga kwa ntunda wofupikilapo ndi masewela otsika ntengo"" which translates to ""Short-distance running is a cheap sport"". It also says ""pali kunsanvetsa pa zida zofunikila"" (there's little need for equipment) and that most purchases ""zambiri zidzakhudza pang'ono kapena osakhudza kwenikweni magwiridwe a ntchito"" (won't really affect performance). This all points to the sport requiring very little equipment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zida zambiri** (A lot of equipment) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
*   **B: Mbiri yokhazikika yamasewero othamangathamanga** (A history of running sports) - The passage doesn't mention anything about the sport's history.
*   **D: Ndalama zambiri** (A lot of money) - The passage specifically states it's a *cheap* sport.

The text states: ""Patapita zaka zinayi patent idaperekedwa, imene idali patent yoyamba padziko lapansi kupekedwa yokhudza MRI.""  It also says Raymond Damadian made the discovery in 1970. Therefore, 1970 + 4 years = 1974.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi anthu azikhala ndi chiyani chomvetsetseka bwino kuti azitha kutanthauzira zochitika za anthu ena?","The correct answer is **B: Cholinga**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...kumvetsetsa **cholinga** cha ena ndikofunikira kwambiri."" (understanding the **intention** of others is very important). The example given illustrates how understanding someone's intention (stealing vs. losing keys) drastically changes how you interpret their actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chikhumbokhumbo (Memory):** While memory is important, the passage doesn't focus on remembering past actions, but understanding current motivations.
*   **C: Chikhulupiliro (Belief):** Beliefs are important for understanding people, but the passage directly highlights *intention* as key to interpreting behavior.
*   **D: Maganiziridwe (Thoughts):** The passage states people can read minds, but emphasizes understanding the *purpose* behind those thoughts, not just the thoughts themselves.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kumvetsetsa malingaliro zimathandiza anthu kupanga chiyani?","The correct answer is **D: Kudziwa maganizidwe a ena** (Understanding the thoughts of others).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Zina zakuthekera kwazimenezi, kumvetsetsa cholinga cha ena ndikofunikira kwambiri."" (One of the possibilities of this, understanding the intentions of others is very important).
* The passage emphasizes the importance of inferring what people think, want, believe, know, or desire. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chotsani kukayikira pamene thupi liyenda** (Remove doubts as the body moves) - This isn't the main focus of the passage.
* **B: Kulosela zikhumbokhumbo** (To read memories) - While the passage mentions reading *thoughts*, it doesn't specifically mention reading *memories*.
* **C: Yang’anani authu ena mosawaweluza** (Look at others without judging) -  The passage is about *understanding* not avoiding judgement.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi chimene chili chiphatikizo cholondola cha AI’s la gawo lalikulu?","The correct answer is **A: Kukozekera (Learning)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AI is a crucial part of computer science ""related to behavior, **learning**, and intelligent adaptation of machines.""  This directly identifies learning as a core component of AI's large field.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kuzindikirika kwa mawu (Speech recognition):** While speech recognition *is* an application of AI, it’s just one example, not the defining large field.
*   **C: Kuyika nthawi (Scheduling):** Scheduling is also an application, but not the overarching principle.
*   **D: Kugwiritsa ntchito zamakono (Current applications):** This refers to *where* AI is used, not *what* it fundamentally is.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi pomwe AI akugwirizana kwambiri?","The correct answer is **D: Kuzindikira zolemba ndi manja** (Recognizing patterns, words, and faces).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""kukuzindikira maonedwe, mau ndi nkhope"" (recognizing patterns, words, and faces) as examples of tasks AI is being used for.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuthandiza anthu ogula malonda** (Helping people shop) - While AI *can* be used in shopping, it's not a primary focus stated in the passage.
*   **B: Kukozekera ndi kuyika nthawi** (Planning and scheduling) - The passage mentions ""kukonzeka"" (planning) but not specifically scheduling.
*   **C: Nthano za Sayansi** (Scientific theories) - AI is a *field* of computer science, but the passage doesn't say it's focused on scientific theories themselves.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people with this type of thinking (""kachitidwe kam'mene mayankho am'mene"") are able to ""kuloweza zakachitikidwe ka zinthu"" - understand how things work. This directly relates to being able to see *how* to approach a problem and find a solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuzindikira mayankho ambiri olondola kuthana ndi vuto (Identifying multiple correct answers to a problem)** - The passage states there is *only one* correct answer.
*   **B: Kugwiritsa ntchito njira zatsopano kuthana ndi vuto (Using new methods to solve a problem)** - The passage emphasizes ""kugwiritsanso njira zokhazikika"" - re-using established methods.
*   **C: Kutenga nthawi yotalika pothana ndi mavuto (Taking a long time to solve problems)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the time it takes to solve problems.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa zinthu izi zomwe sizikuonetsa kuyika chidwi pakupeza yakho la vutolo?","The correct answer is **B: Kutenga nthawi ya anthu ena**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a methodical, individualistic approach to problem-solving. It emphasizes:

*   **Logical thinking:** ""Kuganiza moyenera"" (thinking properly)
*   **Accuracy:** ""Kupanga zinthu molondola"" (creating things accurately)
*   **Independent reasoning:** ""Pali yankho limodzi lokha lolondola"" (there is only one correct answer) - suggesting self-reliance in finding it.
*   **Understanding principles:** ""Kutha kuzindikira mfundo"" (ability to recognize principles)

Taking the time of others (""Kutenga nthawi ya anthu ena"") doesn't fit this description. The passage focuses on *individual* thought processes and reaching a solution through one's own analysis.  It's about internal cognitive processes, not collaborative efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are relevant:

*   **A: Kuzindikira kuti pali yankho limodzi lolondola** (Recognizing that there is one correct answer) - This *is* part of the methodical approach described.
*   **C: Kuziwa zoona** (Knowing the truth) - This aligns with understanding principles and seeking accurate solutions.
*   **D: Kuunjika mauthenga** (Looking at details) -  This reflects the ability to analyze and extract information.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndiziti zimene sizingatengedwe ngati maonekedwe a kathawi kochepa?","The passage describes microexpressions as fleeting facial expressions that last only milliseconds. It focuses on subtle cues that reveal true emotions, even when someone is trying to conceal them. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Kuyang’ana kumbari pamene tiyankhula (Looking away while speaking):** This could be a microexpression indicating discomfort or deception – it's a fleeting behavior.
* **B: Kuwonetsa kusakondwa (Showing displeasure):** Displeasure can be expressed through brief facial changes, making it a potential microexpression.
* **C: Kuphethira kowonjeza (Increased blinking):** Changes in blinking rate can be a subtle sign of stress or deception and can happen very quickly.
* **D: Kugwirizana nazo (Nodding in agreement):** Nodding is a deliberate, relatively sustained action. It’s not a fleeting, subconscious expression like microexpressions. It's something you *do* rather than something that *happens* subconsciously.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Kugwirizana nazo (Nodding in agreement)**. It's not a microexpression because it's a conscious, longer-duration movement.



"
Kodi ndi ndemanga iti pa nkhani ya kutanthauzira kawonekedwe ka nkhope ka kanthawi kochepa imene  siyolondola?,"The correct answer is **A: Kujambula makanema zapita patsogolo** (Recording microexpressions in the past).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *detection* of microexpressions, and specifically mentions using video recording to capture these fleeting facial movements.** The core idea is that these expressions are so brief (milliseconds) they're hard to notice without tools like cameras.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Kutanthauzira moyenera kukhoza kuonetsera kunama** (Accurate interpretation can reveal lies) - While the passage *suggests* this is a potential outcome, it's not the main point about the *technology* used to study it.
    * **C: Mawu oyankhula komanso maonekedwe a nkhope zimatanthauziridwa.** (Speech and facial expressions are interpreted) - This is too general. The passage is about the *specific* interpretation of *micro*expressions.
    * **D: Zikhoza kuthandiza kuona chilungamo** (It can help see justice) - This is a potential application not discussed in the text.



"
Kodi ndi ziti mwa izi zimene zinadzakhala zofunika kwambiri kamba ka kubadwanso mwatsopano?,"The correct answer is **B: Kupititsa patsogolo kuzindikira zinthu (Advancing object recognition)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how information is accessed and learned differently.** It states that remembering is now tied to *meaning* rather than rote memorization, and that the ""beginning of arts and learning"" led to a significant shift in how knowledge is acquired and shared. This strongly suggests an improved ability to *understand* and *recognize* information, not just recall it.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kuyitana munthu kuyambiraso poyambira (Calling a person to start over):** This is unrelated to the passage’s discussion of knowledge and learning.
* **C: Kutha kupezaso zofufuta mauthenga amunthu otumiza ndi olandira (The ability to recover deleted messages from senders and receivers):** This is about data retrieval, not the fundamental process of learning and understanding. While related to information, it's not the core of the passage.
* **D: Kutenga mauthenga (Taking messages):**  This is a simple act of recording information, and doesn’t address the shift in *how* we learn and process it described in the text.



The passage emphasizes a change in *how* we process information - a deeper understanding and recognition - making option B the most logical answer."
"Kamba ka nyengo ya moyo watsopano, malingaliro ochepa anayikidwa pazimenezi?","The best answer is **B: Kulandila maluso (Acquiring skills)**.

Here's why:

* **P's context:** The passage discusses a shift in learning – from rote memorization to understanding *principles*. It highlights a ""revolution"" in learning and knowledge dissemination driven by the ""beginning of arts and sciences."" This strongly implies a focus on *developing abilities* and *skills*.
* **Q's question:**  ""With the dawn of a new season of life, less emphasis was placed on this?""  The ""this"" refers to the old way of learning, the one being replaced.
* **Why B fits:** The old way of learning emphasized memorization. The new way, as described in P, prioritizes *acquiring skills* – the ability to *do* and *understand* rather than simply *remember*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kuyitana munthu kuyambiraso poyambira (Calling a person to restart from the beginning):** This doesn’t fit the context of learning or knowledge.
* **C: Kutha kupezaso zofufuta mauthenga amunthu otumiza ndi olandira (The ability to retrieve lost messages from human senders and receivers):** This is unrelated to the passage’s discussion of learning.
* **D: Kugawa mauthenga (Disseminating messages):** While P mentions knowledge dissemination, it's a *result* of the new learning approach, not the emphasis that was *lost*.



Therefore, **B** best captures the shift away from rote learning and towards a skill-based approach described in the passage."

Kodi ndi liti pamene mayiko akumadzulo kwa Ulaya inasiya kudalira kwambiri Kusintha kwa mphamvu ndi kuyamba kuzidalira okha?,"The correct answer is **C: Pafupifupi zaka 25 patatha ulamuliro wa anthu aku Ulaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...njira zina zakumadzulo zikhoza kubwerera m'mbuyo ndi zaka 25 mpaka 30."" This directly refers to Western Europe developing its own styles *around* 25-30 years after the East (Byzantine influence). This implies they were initially reliant on Eastern influence but then began to diverge and develop independently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pakatikati pa ulamiliro wa anthu aku Ulaya:**  The passage doesn't mention a specific ""middle"" point of European civilization that marks this shift.
* **B: Nthawi ya ulamuliro wa Byzantine:** The passage states the Gothic style *originated* with Byzantine influence, not that Western Europe stopped relying on Byzantine influence *during* the Byzantine period.
* **D: Nthawi ya zaka zikwi 11:** While the passage mentions the 11th and 12th centuries as the early period of Gothic architecture, it doesn't say this is when Western Europe became independent of Eastern influence. It's the delay (25-30 years) that indicates the shift.



"
Kugwiritsa ntchito mabatani kusoka msanga zimachitika kamba ka chiyani? ,"The correct answer is **A: Nyengo ya Gothic**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Chimodzi chazitukuko zomwe zidapezeka munthawiyi kunali kugwilitsa ntchito mabatani kumangira zovala."" and ""Pachiyambi mavalidwe ake amakhudzana zedi ku chikhalidwe chakum'mawa kwa Byzantine."" and that this development happened during the Gothic period (10th-14th centuries).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ulamuliro wa Byzantine:** While Gothic style was *influenced* by Byzantine culture initially, the use of buttons wasn't a defining feature of Byzantine rule itself.
*   **C: Nkhondo pakati pa akhristu ndi asilamu:** The passage doesn't mention any connection between button usage and this conflict.
*   **D: Nthawi yakale ya anthu aku Ulaya:** This is too broad. The passage focuses on a specific period *within* the broader history of Europe - the Gothic period.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi zomwe zikuoneka zatsogolo labwino kuchilengedwe?","The correct answer is **C: Kuzindikira zoyambitsa mavuto** (Identifying the root causes of problems).

Here's why:

* **The passage argues against simply treating symptoms.** It states that focusing on being ""happy with nature"" and ""ecological groups"" is like treating symptoms, not the disease.
* **The passage stresses the need to address the *underlying causes*.**  It explicitly says we need to ""find the real causes of the problems, and conquer them"" if we want a long-term solution.
* **Options A, B, and D are related to the surface-level responses the passage criticizes.** ""Avoiding destructive lifestyle choices"" (A) and ""being a friend to nature"" (D) are good things, but insufficient. ""Changing things"" (B) is too vague and doesn't address the core issue of identifying the problems.

The passage advocates for a proactive approach that gets to the root of environmental problems, making **C** the most accurate answer."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa mayankhowa amene sangayelekezedwe ngati yankho la nkhani yaza chilengedwe?","The correct answer is **A: Kulimbikitsa kusintha zinthu**.

Here's why:

The passage argues that simply addressing *symptoms* of environmental problems isn't enough. It states we need to find and address the *root causes*. ""Kulimbikitsa kusintha zinthu"" (encouraging adaptation) is about dealing with the effects (symptoms) of environmental change, not preventing them. The passage specifically criticizes approaches that only ""help symptoms of the disease.""

Let's look at why the other options are aligned with the passage's argument:

*   **B: Kuchotsa zopangitsa zinthu** (Removing the causes) - This directly reflects the passage's call to address the *root causes* of the problems.
*   **C: Kupeleka liwu pa nkhani ya kupanga chisankho chokhala moyo owononga** (Speaking out against making choices that are destructive to life) - This suggests preventing the causes of environmental issues.
*   **D: Kukhala moyo osamalira zachilengedwe** (Living a life that cares for nature) - This aligns with a proactive, preventative approach, addressing the causes of damage.



"
Ndi dziko liti kunali nkhondo yoyamba ku Ulaya chifukwa chake chinali cha ulamuliro osati nkhani yachipembedzo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sipeni**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Spanish War of Succession was the *first* war where the main issue was the balance of power, rather than religion. Spain was a major power involved in that war.  The passage goes on to say that this marked a shift away from wars *about* religion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Mangalande:** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **Jeremani:** While Germany (or parts of it) was involved in many European conflicts, the passage doesn't identify it as the focus of the first power struggle war.
*   **Pochugo (Portugal):** Not mentioned as central to this shift in the passage.



"
Ndi nkhondo iti yomwe nthawi zina imadziwika kuti ‘’nkhondo yachipembedzo’ yomaliza?,"The correct answer is **A: Nkhondo yotha zaka makumi atatu** (The Thirty Years' War).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndiye kuti, Nkhondo ya zaka Makumi Atatu izakhala nkhondo yomaliza kutchedwa ya chipembedzo."" (And so, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be called a war of religion.)



"
Kodi ndi chiyani chimene mumagawo a kachisi wa akatolika sichimaonedwa mokwanira?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngati zikhulupiliro zikuluzikulu zamumpingo zimakwanilitsidwa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...izi zakhala zokayikitsa kuti zolinga za mpingowu zakhala zukwanilitsidwa."" This directly refers to whether the fundamental beliefs and aims of the Church are being fulfilled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngati kagawidwe kachuma mu kachisi kanali koyenelera** - While the passage mentions wealth and using it to alleviate suffering, the core issue isn't simply about fair distribution of wealth.
* **B: Ngati zikhulupiliro zachipembedzo zitasithidwa** - The passage doesn't say beliefs are being compromised, but rather questioned if the *goals* of the beliefs are being met.
* **C: Mphamvu zizikhala mkati mwa mpingo** - The passage acknowledges the Church *has* power, the issue isn't whether it *should* have power, but whether it's being used effectively to achieve its religious goals.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndindani amene adaphedwa ku Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Mlonda**.

The passage states, ""Nthawi yina yake m'modzi mwawogalukira nakupiza mutu wa m'modzi mwa azilonda ku Versailles pamaso pa Mfumukazi yomwe idali ndi mantha."" This directly indicates that a guard (mlonda) from Versailles was killed."

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi kwa ndani amene angakhuzidwe ndi matenda okhudza ubongo?","The correct answer is **A: Mkazi wazaka 32**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kafukufuku wapeza kuti azimayi mwayi kawiri konse kukhala ndi MS kuposa azibambo."" (Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS compared to men.) and ""MS ndi matenda amitsempha omwe atenga malo kwa achichepere komanso achikulire apakatikati."" (MS is a disease that affects young adults and middle-aged adults).
* A 32-year-old woman falls into the ""middle-aged"" category and is a woman, making her the most likely candidate based on the information given.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Mnyamata wazaka 15:** While MS *can* affect younger people, it's less common and the passage highlights middle-aged adults.  Also, the passage states women are more likely to get it.
* **C: M’bambo wazaka 43:** The passage specifically states men are *less* likely to have MS than women.
* **D: Mtsikana wazaka 10:**  MS is rare in children this young. The passage highlights young *adults* and middle-aged adults.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, anthu okonda kuchita zimenezi akufunika thandizo la chiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Matha chifukwa chakumva kuwawa** (Sorrow because of feeling pain).

Here's why:

The passage states that *kukhumudwa, mantha komanso kuganizila mavuto* (sadness, fear, and worrying) help the relationship between pain and disability for people with chronic pain. It specifically mentions needing support regarding *maganizidwe olakwika pa ululu* (incorrect thoughts about pain) – differentiating everyday pain from not getting better. This suggests people struggling with chronic pain need help processing the emotional distress (sadness, fear) *caused* by the pain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pansi pa msana** (Under the knee) - The passage refers to chronic pain generally, not a specific location.
* **C: Kukhumudwa** (Sadness) - While sadness is mentioned, the passage emphasizes the *need for support* with these feelings *because* of the pain.
* **D: Mantha** (Fear) - Similar to sadness, fear is a symptom, but the passage highlights needing help *with* the fear, stemming from the pain.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi masewera a fencing amamenyedwa bwanji?","The correct answer is **D: Nkhondo ya anthu awiri**.

The passage states: ""Masewerawa choyambilira amaseweredwa pamene pali awiriawiri..."" which translates to ""The game is initially played when there are pairs..."" This directly indicates fencing is played as a duel between two individuals.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mawonekedwe atsopano** - The passage doesn't discuss new formats.
*   **B: Pamlingo ya Univesite** - While fencing is played at university level, the passage doesn't focus on that.
*   **C: Pamlingo wa Olempiki** - The passage mentions the Olympics, but states the *basic* gameplay involves two people, not specifically the Olympic level.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi zikhoza kutengedwa ngati umboni wa poyizoni wa mkati mwathupi?","The correct answer is **D: Botolo logwiritsira ntchito pomwa mankhwala**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Chidziwitso chakuti pakuyikidwa mankhwala woipa, ndiko kupezeka kwa kontena yotseguka yamankhwala kapena mankhwala ena wowopsa opezeka mnyumba."" (Evidence of poisoning includes the presence of an open medicine container or other dangerous substances found in the house.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nselu ndi kumva kutentha thupi (Fever and feeling hot)** – While these can be symptoms of *something* being wrong, they aren't specifically mentioned as evidence of poisoning in the text.
*   **B: Kusanza ndi kutuluka thukuta (Drowsiness and vomiting)** – The passage states symptoms like drowsiness might not be enough to confirm poisoning, and require testing.
*   **C: Kuchepa kwa minofu athupi ndi kuwawa kwa m’mimba (Muscle weakness and stomach pain)** -  These are symptoms that could have many causes, not just poisoning.

Therefore, finding a medicine bottle used for drinking is the direct piece of evidence mentioned in the text to suggest possible poisoning."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiti choyamba chofunika kuchita pamene tikuona munthu okhuzidwayo?","The correct answer is **C: Kuona m’mene alili munthu okhuzidwa (To see how the person is)**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) starts by saying ""Kuti muone wovulala mukuyenera kuona kaye pamalopo."" which translates to ""To help someone injured, you must first see how they are.""  It emphasizes understanding their condition (""momwe wofuna thandizo m'mene wakhalira"") before approaching or offering help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuwona zochitika pamalo (To see what happened at the scene):** While important context, the passage prioritizes assessing the *person's* state first.
* **B: Kukumana ndi munthu okhuzidwa (To meet the injured person):**  You shouldn't just rush to approach; observation is key first.
* **D: Dikilani thandizo (Wait for help):** The passage is about *you* providing help, not waiting for others.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa ndemangazi zimene sizikupeleka chithunzithunzi chabwino cha njira yothandizira munthu okhuzidwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Musakhale okhuzidwa ndi mavuto anu** (Don't be affected by your own issues).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of being aware of *your* emotional state and potential triggers when assisting someone who is traumatized.**  It warns that if *you* are distressed, you could worsen the situation. Therefore, becoming emotionally involved with your own problems is *not* a good practice.

Let's look at why the other options are good practices according to the passage and general trauma-informed care:

* **B: Onetsetsani malo musanaone okhuzidwayo** (Ensure the location before seeing the affected person) - Creating a safe environment is crucial.
* **C: Onetsetsani magonedwe a okhuzidwa** (Assess the condition of the affected person) - Understanding their state is vital.
* **D: Yesani kuwona ziopsyezo ngati zilipo** (Try to identify risks if they exist) - Being aware of potential dangers is important for safety.

Therefore, only option A contradicts the advice given in the passage.



"
Ndi kusintha kuti komwe kunapangika ndi French Revolution kunali kwabwino kwa anthu ogwira ntchito?,"The correct answer is **B: Kusintha chidwi kuchoka ku maonekedwe kupita ku machitidwe a zinthu moyenelera komanso mwachangu.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kusinthako ntchito zinali zotseguka kwa amuna onse anafunsira kulora onse ofuna kutchuka ndi kuchita bwino...Kusintha kwa zinthu ku France kunalimbikitsa anthu ogwira ntchito amaiko ena kuti nao asinthe zinthu."" This directly points to the Revolution creating a system based on merit and opportunity, rather than birthright or social standing. This is a shift in focus *from* who you *were* (social class) *to* what you *could do* (ability and performance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kulimbikitsa thandizo ku dziko** - While the revolution might have fostered nationalism eventually, the passage's focus is on the changes to opportunity for workers.
* **C: Kutsatira mfundo za boma la Republican** -  The passage mentions the shift *towards* self-governance, but doesn't highlight simply following Republican principles as the benefit for workers.
* **D: Njira yatsopano yoyezera** - The passage mentions the metric system, but that's a specific detail; the bigger impact for workers was the change in how they could advance.



"
"Potsatira French Revolution, kuchita bwino kwa asilikali ndi magulu ena kunali kochepa kuti ngati mulingo wake oyezera?","The correct answer is **D: Kuthekera kwa munthu** (Potential of the individual).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a shift away from systems based on birthright (class) towards systems based on merit.**  The French Revolution opened opportunities for people to rise based on their skills and abilities (""kutabwera kusintha ntchito zinali zotseguka kwa amuna onse anafunsira kulora onse ofuna kutchuka ndi kuchita bwino"").  Going into the military was now based on ability, not social class.
* **""Kuthekera kwa munthu""** directly reflects this idea - that a person's success is determined by *what they can do* (their potential) rather than *who they are born as*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kupambana (Victory):** While the revolution had some victories, the passage focuses on the *opportunity* for individuals to succeed, not just the outcome of victory.
* **B: Gulu la ana kuphunzira mukalasi (A class of children learning):** This is unrelated to the core idea of meritocracy and individual potential.
* **C: Cholakalaka (Ambition):** Ambition is *a driver* for people to succeed, but it's not the *system* that allows them to succeed based on merit.



"
Kodi ndi ntchito ziti zaboma zomwe zimayambitsa kusakhutira kwambiri kumayiko otukuka?,"The correct answer is **C: Mayendedwe anjira ya aliyense** (Transportation for everyone).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses entirely on the problems with transportation.** It describes how almost everyone relies on transportation, worries about its issues, and contrasts it with the reliability of infrastructure in developed countries regarding water and buildings.  The entire question is about *why* transportation systems frequently fail and cause frustration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madzi abwino (Good water)** - The passage specifically states developed countries *don't* have problems with bad water.
* **B: Kumanga Mlatho (Building construction)** - Similar to water, the passage notes buildings aren't a major concern in developed nations.
* **D: Maphunziro (Education)** - Education isn't mentioned at all in the passage.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani chomwe chinganenedwe chokhuzana ndi nkhani za mayendedwe?","The correct answer is **C: Amapangitsa madandaulo ambiri ndi amene amawagwiritsa ntchito**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Pafupifupi aliyense amadandaula ndi njira za mayendedwe"" (Almost everyone worries about transport) and asks why transport has so many problems and failures. This directly supports the idea that transport *causes* many problems for those who use it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amakondedwa ndi anthu onse amene amawagwiritsa ntchito** - The passage implies the opposite - people *worry* about them, not necessarily love them.
*   **B: Sioyipa ngati m’mene maonekedwe a madzi alili** - The passage contrasts transport problems with water/infrastructure issues in developed countries, it doesn't say transport is *better* than those problems.
*   **D: Ndi omasuka mumayiko otukuka** - The passage states developed countries *don't* have the same problems with infrastructure, but doesn't say transport is ""free"" or easy in those places.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi zili zovuta kudziwa kamba ka kusapanganika kwa madalayivala?","The correct answer is **D: Kuyenda kwa magalimoto** (The movement of vehicles).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mwatsoka, ndizovuta kudziwa m'mene magalimoto amayendera chifukwa khalidwe lawoyendetsa magalimoto silopanganika kwathunthu."" This translates to ""Unfortunately, it is difficult to know how vehicles travel because the behavior of drivers is not completely predictable.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuthamanga kwa magalimoto** (The speed of vehicles) - The passage discusses relationships *including* speed, but doesn't say it's difficult to know speed itself.
*   **B: Dongosolo lapa msewu** (Road layout) - The passage implies roads are structured enough to model vehicle paths as splines.
*   **C: Zochitika mu msewu** (Events in traffic) - The passage doesn't focus on specific events, but overall movement patterns.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi chimene chimagwiritsidwa ntchito pamene galimoto ikuyendetsedwa ndi dilayivala?,"The correct answer is **B: Khalidwe la Dalayivala (Driver Behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Mwatsoka, ndizovuta kudziwa m'mene magalimoto amayendera chifukwa **khalidwe lawoyendetsa magalimoto** silopanganika kwathunthu."" (Unfortunately, it is difficult to know how vehicles travel because **driver behavior** is not completely uniform.)  It then goes on to say that while not perfectly predictable, drivers have *consistent* behaviors, allowing for modeling of traffic patterns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zochitika mu msewu (Road conditions/events):** While road conditions *affect* driving, the passage focuses on *how* drivers react and move, not the conditions themselves.
*   **C: Makozedwe a msewu (Road layout):** Similar to A, this is a factor that influences driving but isn’t the central focus.
*   **D: Kuchuluka kwa magalimoto (Traffic volume):**  The passage mentions ""kachulukidwe"" (volume) as *one of the relationships* used to model traffic, but it's not the primary thing being considered when a driver is driving.



"
Kodi Hershey ndi Chase anagwiritsa ntchito chiyani kuyika DNA? ,"The correct answer is **A: Fosifolasi wa Radioactive**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Anachita kafukufuku muwiri owonetsa DNA mu phage ndi phosphorus wa radioactive..."" This directly indicates they used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jenetiki matiliyo:** This is a general term for genetic material and wasn't *used* by Hershey and Chase, but rather what they were investigating.
* **C: Safa wa Radioactive:** The passage states sulfur was used to label the *protein*, not the DNA.
* **D: Mavayilasi:**  This is an enzyme and doesn't relate to the labeling method used in the Hershey-Chase experiment.



"
Kuthekela kositha DNA kupelekedwa ku ana kumatengera chiyani?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngati maselo ali amene akupanga mazira mu akazi komanso umuna mu amuna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zosintha zokha m'ma selo okhala ndi majeremusi ndizomwe zimatha kupatsira ana"" (Only changes in germline cells can be inherited by children). Germline cells are those involved in reproduction – eggs in females and sperm in males.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ubwino wa zinthu za jenetiki (Quality of genetic material):** While the quality of the genetic material is important, it doesn't determine *whether* a mutation is passed on, only the effect it *might* have.
* **C: Mtundu wa muteshoni (Type of mutation):** The passage says mutations have different outcomes, but doesn't link the *type* of mutation to heritability.  Heritability depends on *where* the mutation occurs.
* **D: Ngati muteshoni ikhoza kupangitsa selo kufa (If the mutation can cause cell death):**  A mutation causing cell death doesn't mean it's inherited; in fact, it means it's *not* being passed on in that cell line.



"
"Kutengera ndi zomwe mwapatsidwa pa ndimeyi, kodi chifukwa chiyani mitundu yosiyana ya muteshoni imakhala yosadalilika?","The correct answer is **B: Ngati magenetiki okhuzidwa ali opanga mazira mu akazi komamnso umuna mu amauna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Mutations in germ-line cells (cells that produce eggs or sperm) are the only ones that can be inherited by offspring. 
* **The question asks:** Why are different types of mutations variable (i.e., have different outcomes).

The variability stems from *where* the mutation occurs. If it's in a germ-line cell, it can be passed down. If it's in other cells, it can cause cell death or cancer, but won't be inherited.  Therefore, whether the affected genes are in egg or sperm-producing cells is crucial to understanding the variable outcomes of mutations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kodi ndi mulingo ochuluka bwanji wa zinthu za jenetiki umene umakhuzidwa:** The amount of genetic material affected isn't the primary factor determining if it's heritable.
* **C: Ubwino wa kukhuzidwa kwa zinthu za jenetiki:** The ""quality"" of the genetic material isn't the defining factor. The *location* of the mutation is.
* **D: Mtundu wamuteshoni yokhuzidwa:** While the *type* of mutation matters to the outcome (cell death vs. cancer), the passage emphasizes whether it’s in germ-line cells or not as the key to heritability.



"
Kodi ndichiyani mwa izi sichinali chifukwa kuti pachikhalidwe chakalekale amasunga mbuzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Amapeleka nthawi yawo kwa anthu ena**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states people kept goats for:** milk, hair, meat, and skins.
*   **Option C** – ""Amapeleka nthawi yawo kwa anthu ena"" (They give their time to other people) – is not mentioned as a reason for keeping goats in the passage. It's not a benefit derived from goat domestication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amapeleka mwayi opeza nyama** (They provide an opportunity to get meat) – The passage explicitly mentions meat as a reason.
*   **B: Amathandizira kudyetsa ziweto** (They help with feeding livestock) - The passage does not directly mention this.
*   **D: Amapeleka mwayi wakumwa mkaka** (They provide an opportunity to drink milk) – The passage explicitly mentions milk as a reason.



"
Chigoli cha gofu ndikutenga kathawi kochepa kachiyani?,"The correct answer is **C: Nthawi (Time)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the winner is the player who finishes with the *fewest strokes* (meaning movements of the club). This directly relates to completing the course in the *shortest time* – not necessarily speed of play, but the least number of swings needed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mipira (Balls):** While balls are used, the *goal* isn't just to hit balls.
*   **B: Kupikisana muma raundi (Competing in rounds):** Rounds are how the game is structured, but not the objective.
*   **D: Mabowo (Holes):** Getting the ball into the holes is *how* you win, but not the goal itself – the goal is to do it with the fewest strokes.



"
"Pa bwalo lochitira masewero a gofu, ndi malo ali kapinga amadulidwa kwambiri?","The correct answer is **B: Pamalo obiliwira**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kapinga wozungulira dzenje amaumweta kuti afupike ndipo amatchulidwa kuti wobiriwira."" This directly means the grass is cut shorter on the greens (the ""wobiriwira"" or green areas) to make putting easier.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pabowo la khumi ndi mphamvu zisanu ndi zitatu:** The passage mentions the 18 holes, but doesn't say the grass is specifically shorter *at* the 18th hole.
*   **C: Pabowo loyamba:** Similar to A, it doesn't specify the first hole.
*   **D: Pagawo loyamba la masewero:** This is too vague; the passage focuses on the condition of the grass itself, not just the start of the game."
Kodi ndi chifukwa chiti chenicheni chopangira zoyeselera zasayansi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kupeza m’mene dziko limayendera** (To find out how the world works).

Here's why:

* **The passage states directly:** ""Cholinga chachikulu cha sayansi ndikudziwa momwe dziko lapansi limagwilira ntchito kudzera njira ya sayansi."" (The main goal of science is to know how the world works through the scientific method.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuchotsa chimodzi kapena ziwiri choyeselera pa maganizo owona** (Removing one or two variables from true ideas) - While controlling variables is *part* of experimentation, it’s not the ultimate goal.
* **C: Kufunsa mafunso** (Asking questions) - Asking questions is a starting point, but not the ultimate reason *for* doing experiments.
* **D: Kuthandiza kafukufuku wa sayansi** (Helping scientific research) -  This is a *result* of experimentation, not the fundamental reason *why* we experiment.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndiziti zimene sizi mathandiza kafukufuku wa sayansi?","The correct answer is **A: Njira za sayansi zokha**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Ngakhale sizili zokha..."" meaning that the scientific method *isn't* the only thing that helps scientific research. It goes on to list other things that *do* help: experimentation, observation, asking questions, and identifying patterns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kukhala ndikumawonerera (Observation):** The passage explicitly states that observation helps scientific research.
*   **C: Kuchotsa maganizo oyenelezedwa (Removing bias):** While not directly stated, removing bias is a core principle *within* the scientific method and important for good research.
*   **D: Kupanga zoyeselera (Experimentation):** The passage explicitly states that experimentation helps scientific research.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi ndemanga iti yokhuzana ndi namondwe isali yolondola?","The correct answer is **A: Namondwe ali ndi kuthekera kuwononga china chili chonse pamene wadutsapo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mphepo zamkuntho ... zitha kuononga chilichonse mu njira yake."" (Tornadoes... can destroy anything in their path.) This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Namondwe amamenya malo ang’ono koposa mphepo zina** - While the passage says they happen in a *small area*, it doesn't explicitly compare their size to other winds.
* **C: Anamondwe ambiri amakhala akuomba kupitilira maola atatu** - The passage states a *severe* tornado lasts for three hours, not that most do.
* **D: Namondwe wina amatha kuthamanga mamayilosi 300 pa ola limodzi** - The passage mentions a speed of 300 mph (approximately 480 km/h), but doesn't say *every* tornado reaches that speed.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi nkhani iti mwankhanizi yomwe yafotokozeredwa mowona pa mphepo zamkuntho za Tonado?","The correct answer is **B: Zimapanga mphepo zomwe zimathamanga mamayilosi 480 paola limodzi**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Mphepo zowopsa zamkunthozi zimakhala ndimphepo zothamanga mpaka 480 km / h (133 m / s; 300 mph)."" (Dangerous tornadoes have winds as fast as 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nthawi zambiri amaposera maola atatu kuti athe** - The passage says a *2%* of tornadoes last for 3 hours, not that they *always* do.
*   **C: Zimakhudza madera akuluakulu kusiyana ndi anamondwe ena** - The passage states tornadoes happen in a *small area* compared to other winds.
*   **D: Ali ndi kuthekera kuzula mitengo kuchokera mnthaka** - While true according to the text (""imazula mitengo""), this is just *an example* of the damage tornadoes can cause. It isn't the main, overarching point.



"
Kodi ndi ziti mwa izi zomwe anthu anayamba kupanga muzaka zam’ma 1600?,"The correct answer is **D: Kupanga matelesikopu** (Making telescopes).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ma telescope woyamba adapangidwa ku Ulaya nzaka zam'ma zana 16."" (The first telescopes were made in Europe in the 17th century).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kugwiritsa ntchito magalasi** (Using glasses) - The passage says people had been using glasses for ""zikwi zikwi"" (thousands) of years *before* the 1600s.
* **B: Kukulitsa zinthu** (Magnifying things) -  Glasses already magnified things before telescopes were invented.
* **C: Kupanga magalasi** (Making glasses) - Again, glassmaking and using glasses predates the 1600s by a long time.



"
Kodi ndikwa nthawi yayitali bwanji anthu akhala akuwonetsa zinthu zing’onozing’ono kuwoneka zazikulu pogwiritsa ntchito malenzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwa zaka zikwizikwi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states people have been *making* and using lenses to make things appear larger for ""zaka zikwi zikwi"" (thousands of years). The question asks about how long they have been *showing* things small to appear larger, which is essentially the same activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwa zaka chikwi chimodzi (For one thousand years):** While a long time, the passage says ""thousands of years"" – plural.
* **B & D: Kuyambira kumapeto kwa dzaka zam'ma 1501 mpaka 1600 / Kuyambira kumayambiliro kwa dzaka zam'ma 1501 mpaka 1600 (From the late 1501s to 1600 / From the early 1501s to 1600):** These refer to the invention of the *telescope*, not the long history of using lenses for magnification. The telescope is a specific *type* of lens-based magnification.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi malo amene Muhammad anabisala amati chiyani pa moyo wa uzimu ndi zinthu zofunika?","The correct answer is **A: Amakhulupilira mtendere ndi kuzipatula**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the solitude and detachment offered by the cave of Hira.** It describes it as a place ""away from the world,"" where ""nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains,"" and where ""few sounds of the world can be heard."" This strongly suggests Muhammad sought this place for peace and isolation.
* **The passage portrays Hira as conducive to deep contemplation.** Muhammad went there specifically ""to reflect."" This links to a spiritual life and the importance of inward focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Phokoso la panja likhoza kuthandiza kuganiza mozama (External noise can help with deep thinking):** The passage explicitly states the opposite – the cave’s isolation *from* sounds helps with contemplation.
* **C: Amafunika kukhala yekha nthawi yochepa (He needed to be alone for a short time):**  The passage implies Muhammad spent significant time in the cave, suggesting it wasn't just for short periods.
* **D: Anali oyembekezera kuti amuone komanso amumve (He was expecting to see and hear):** The text doesn't mention any expectation of visions or voices, only of reflection.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ayiloni adagwiritsidwa ntchito yanji kumayambiliro?","The correct answer is **B: Msewu wa ngolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njira zoyenda ngolo zinamangidwa ku Mangalande kalekale zaka zama 1500...zinkathandiza akavalo kuti azikoka ngolo ndi changu kwambiri komanso kukoka ngolo zakatundu wambiri kusiyana misewu yomwe idali yoyipa kwambiri patsikulo."" This directly indicates that horses were used on the early ""msewu wa ngolo"" (tramways/railways).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zopingasira njanji:** While crossties were introduced, the passage doesn't say horses were *used on* the crossties themselves.
*   **C: Magudumu:** The passage discusses railways, not wheeled carts.
*   **D: Njanji:** The passage discusses the *development* of railways, but horses were used on the *early* versions of the railways (msewu wa ngolo) before they were fully developed.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndichifukwa chiyani magudumu amitengo adasinthidwa ndikuyika a ayiloni?","The correct answer is **C: Amatha kupilira kukatundu wochuluka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Patapita nthawi mateyala a mitengo adasinthidwa ndikuyika azitsulo."" and earlier says that wooden rails helped horses pull heavier loads.  This implies the steel was used because it was more durable and could handle greater weight/loads than wood.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zidawonjezera kuthamanga kwa akavalo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about increasing horse power.
*   **B: Adaganiziridwa kuti zidali zabwino kwambiri** - While steel *was* better, the passage focuses on the practical reason of durability, not just a general belief in its superiority.
*   **D: Zimawola kamba ka ayiloni mu msewu** - The passage doesn’t mention anything about allowing steel rails for the wagons to pass through.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi chidasintha anthu mu nthawi ya Romantizimu?","The correct answer is **D: Chikhalidwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Romanticism involved people ""who obtained a sense of place, races, and **culture** in the area."" It contrasts these people with those governed by ""artificially created laws.""  This directly indicates that a shift in **culture** was a defining aspect of the Romantic period, allowing people to find peace and identity within their heritage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Malamulo** - The passage contrasts people *against* artificial laws, saying they found peace *outside* of them, not that laws themselves changed them.
*   **B: Malo** - While ""place"" is mentioned, it's a component *of* the cultural identity, not the primary thing that changed people.
*   **C: Miyambo** - Tradition is related to culture, but the passage focuses more broadly on the overall sense of cultural identity.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiyani mwa izi zomwe sizikugwirizana ndi kukoka uta?","The correct answer is **D: Kuyambira pali chule**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a ""down bow"" (represented by a box without a bottom) means you **start** (when your hand holds the bow) and **draw** the bow.  ""Kuyambira pali chule"" (starting at the top) describes the *up bow* not the down bow.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the text:

*   **A: Mawu apansipansi** (Downward strokes) - This aligns with the description of the ""down bow"" being strong and direct.
*   **B: Chizindikiro chowoneka ngati chofunika kwambiri** (Important symbol) - The passage states marks were placed on sheet music for a reason, so they should be respected.
*   **C: Mawu a mphamvu** (Powerful strokes) - The passage describes the down bow as being powerful.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi zimene zimafanana ndi mawu apansipansi?","The correct answer is **B: Kukoka uta**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""pansi kuthanthauza kuyamba (pamene dzanja lanu likugwira uta) ndikukoka uta.""  This directly defines what ""down bow"" means - starting with the bow held and *drawing* the bow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chizindikiro cha uta wakugwa** - This refers to the *symbol* for down bow, not the action itself.
*   **C: Chizindikiro chooneka ngati V** - This describes the up bow symbol.
*   **D: Kuyambira pamene dzanja lanu likugwira uta** - While part of the description of a down bow, it's not the complete definition, ""kukoka uta"" describes the action of the bow.



"
Zinthu zotsalira zimene zinali ndi moyo zimaonetsa manja amene atengedwa kuti agwiritsidwe ntchito makamaka pa ziti zotsatirazi?,"The correct answer is **D: Mayendedwe adzala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zotsalira za mafupa am'manja azaka zokwana ma miliyoni awiri mpaka atatu zawonetsa kusintha kwa ukadaulo wa manja kuchokera posuntha poyendera mpaka kusinthidwa kwake."" This directly links the changes in hand structure to a shift *from* using hands for locomotion (walking/climbing) *to* something else.  The phrasing ""kusinthidwa kwake"" suggests modification for a new purpose.
* **""Mayendedwe adzala"" (knuckle-walking) is the closest related activity.** While the passage doesn't specifically say knuckle-walking, the shift *from* using hands for general locomotion implies a modified form of it.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Kunama (lying down)**: The passage doesn't mention anything about lying down.
    * **B: Kuchepetsa kulemera (reducing weight)**: While chimpanzees use their hands to help support their weight, the passage focuses on the *change* in hand structure, not just its original function.
    * **C: Mayendedwe (locomotion)**: The passage states hands were *less* used for locomotion, indicating a shift *away* from this.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi zimene zikufotokoza moyenera za mafupa a dzala za chimpanzi?,"The correct answer is **B: Manja awo ndi miyendo imasiyana makulidwe** (Their hands and feet differ in size).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dzanja ndi phazi la chimpanzee ndilofanana kukula ndi kutalika kwake"" (The chimpanzee’s hand and foot are similar in size and length). This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndi wowongoka kuposa anthu’** (They are straighter than humans): The passage says *human* phalanges are straighter, not chimpanzee's.
* **C: Amagwiritsidwa ntchito kuchepetsa kulemera** (They are used to reduce weight): While chimpanzees *use* their hands to help with weight distribution while walking, the passage doesn't state that's a characteristic of the *bones themselves*.
* **D: Amagwiritsidwa ntchito kwambiri ponama** (They are used extensively for climbing): While chimpanzees climb, the passage focuses on the differences in hand structure related to *walking* and weight bearing, not specifically climbing.



"
Kusankha kumachotsa majinzi atsopano kuchokera mu azake ati?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubisala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kusankha kumachotsa chithucho pamadzi a zinthu zosithasitha."" (Selection removes the trait from the pool of recessive traits).  ""Kubisala"" (recessive) refers to traits that are hidden or masked. Selection acts *against* these hidden traits, removing them from the gene pool.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kusinthana kwa majinzi** (Gene mutation) - The passage discusses selection *acting on* existing traits, not creating new ones through mutation.
* **C: Kusankhana** (Assortative mating) - This relates to mating preferences, not the removal of traits by selection.
* **D: Kumasuka** (Freedom/Release) - This doesn't relate to the process described in the passage.



"
Ndi njira iti yopangitsa kusiyana kwa magenetiki?,"The correct answer is **A: Kusankhana (Selection)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Kusankha kumachotsa chithucho pamadzi a zinthu zosithasitha"" - which translates to ""Selection removes the seed from the pool of wasteful things"". This indicates selection is a key process in genetic differentiation. It favors certain traits, leading to changes in the genetic makeup of populations.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate based on the passage:

* **B: Kusinthana kwa majinzi (Crossing over/Recombination):** The passage mentions ""kusinthidwe"" (mutation) as introducing new variations, but doesn't specifically highlight recombination as the *driving force* of differentiation.
* **C: Kusintha kwa zinthu muthupi kamba kogawikana ka maselo (Mutation during cell division):** While mutation *creates* variation, the passage focuses on how that variation is *acted upon* to cause differentiation.
* **D: Kumasuka (Drift):** The passage doesn’t mention genetic drift.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Mamembala agulu laling'ono lachikhalidwe omwe amachokera muchikhalidwe chawo chachikulu, nthawi zambiri amaonetsa umembala wawo podzera munjira zawozawo komaso pogwiritsa ntchito zizindikiro zina monga, zovala zopangidwa mofanana, maulemu awo komaso zining'a."" This directly refers to using appearance (clothes, symbols, etc.) to signal belonging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuyesetsa kulolelana** (Trying to get along) - While subcultures might want to coexist, the passage focuses on *demonstrating* identity, not just getting along.
* **B: Kutsata zikhulupiliro za aliyese wazungulira** (Following the beliefs of everyone around) - Subcultures, by definition, often *challenge* or differ from mainstream beliefs.
* **C: Kuvomereza zotsatidwa mudera** (Accepting local customs) - Again, subcultures are often about distinguishing themselves, not simply accepting norms.

"Malingana ndi nkhani ili mu ndimeyi, zingachitike ndi chiyani kwa mwana amene wapezana ndi tsankho la mtundu okhuzana ndi zikhulupiliro za magulu kudzela kuopysezedwa?","The correct answer is **B: Mwana akhoza kuyamba khalidwe loopysezana (The child may begin to exhibit the stereotyped behavior).**

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) directly states that being labeled with a stereotype, even at a young age, can *cause* the child to internalize and act out that stereotype.**  The example given illustrates this - children labeled as ""poor students"" based on their race may actually *perform* poorly after being made aware of that label.
* **Stereotype threat** is the phenomenon described in the passage. It's the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about one's group, which can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mwana akhoza kuyesera kuzemba khalidwe loopysezedwa (The child may try to embrace the stereotyped behavior):** While possible, the passage focuses on *inadvertently* adopting the behavior due to pressure, not actively embracing it.
* **C: Mwana akhoza kusiya kusewera ndi azake (The child may stop playing with their peers):** While social withdrawal is a *possible* consequence of experiencing discrimination, it's not the central point of the passage.
* **D: Mwana akhoza kumakana kusewera ndi magulu a anthu opanda mphamvu (The child may refuse to play with groups of powerless people):** This isn't addressed in the passage. The focus is on internalizing the stereotype about *their own* group.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kuzindikira kwa mwana pa zikhulupiliro za magulu kungakhale ndi tanthauzo muzinthu ngati ziti?","The correct answer is **B: Khalidwe lawo (Their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that being labeled with a stereotype about a racial group *affects their behavior*. It uses the example of children identified as belonging to a group stereotyped as performing poorly in school; these children then perform worse *after* being made aware of the stereotype. This directly links awareness of group beliefs (the stereotype) to changes in behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kusakhana mtundu amasankha moziyenereza ndi ena ake (Racial identity chooses to identify with others)**: The passage doesn't discuss identity formation, only the *impact* of external labels.
*   **C: Ubale wawo ndi ana ena (Their relationships with other children)**: While stereotypes *could* affect relationships, the passage focuses on internal changes in the child's performance.
*   **D: Kutanthauzira kwawo kwa mtundu (Their interpretation of race)**: The passage doesn't delve into how children understand the concept of race itself, but rather how external beliefs about race affect them.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi zimene sizikugwirizana ndi maleledwe a mwana ovuta?","The correct answer is **B: Mayakhulidwe abwino opambana.**

Here's why:

The passage describes children raised with little to no human contact, often due to abandonment, neglect, or severe disability. These children typically exhibit behaviors stemming from their lack of socialization – fear of people, lack of physical affection, and generally being *different* than those raised normally. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

*   **A: Kukhala odzidalira (Being self-reliant):** Children forced to survive on their own often develop strong self-reliance.
*   **C: Makhalidwe ozipatula pagulu (Distinctive behavior):** Their upbringing leads to behavioral differences compared to typically socialized children.
*   **D: Kukhala wamatha (Being withdrawn):** Fear and lack of social interaction often result in a withdrawn personality.

**Mayakhulidwe abwino opambana (Positive and winning characteristics)** is the opposite of what the passage describes. These children are characterized by *difficulties* stemming from their challenging upbringing, not positive traits.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiyani mwa izi zimene sizikugwirizana ndi malimidwe ozithandiza wekha?","The correct answer is **B: Kulima chakudya chogulitsa kwa ena**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that subsistence farming is done ""for the purpose of having enough food for the farmer and their family."" It's about self-sufficiency.  Growing food *to sell* goes against that core principle.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with subsistence farming:

*   **A: Kuyika chidwi pa zokolola zokwanilitsa zofuna za pankhomo la mulimi** - (Focusing on yields to meet the farmer's family's needs) This is the primary goal of subsistence farming.
*   **C: Kuyika chidwi pa zokolola zambiri kusiyana ndi maluso otsogola** - (Focusing on diverse yields rather than advanced skills) The text mentions using traditional methods and seed saving, implying a focus on variety and simplicity over high-tech practices.
*   **D: Kupeza mbewu kufupi ndi malo amlimi** - (Sourcing seeds locally) The passage highlights using seeds ""saved from the ecoregion,"" which means getting seeds from the local environment.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi zimene zikufotokoza bwino malimidwe ozithandiza wekha?,"The correct answer is **A: Zonse zikupangika munjila zamalimidwe ndi kupanga chakudya** (Everything is built around farming methods and food production).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly describes self-sufficiency farming as being for food security for the farmer and their family.** This means the entire practice revolves around *how* they farm and *what* they produce for food.
* The passage details specifics of this type of farming: using saved seeds, diverse cropping, and simple propagation techniques – all methods related to *farming practices* and *food production*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imagwiritsa ntchito maluso apadera kukolola zambiri** (It uses special skills to harvest a lot) - The passage doesn't emphasize high yields or 'special skills' for harvesting; it focuses on sustainability and enough food for the family.
* **C: Imalora akatswiri a zaulimi kugawana mbewu zawo mudera lonse** (It encourages agricultural experts to share their seeds throughout the area) - The passage actually mentions *saving* seeds *from the local region*, not relying on experts or wide distribution.
* **D: Imagwiritsidwa ntchito ndi alimi mu maiko ena** (It is used by farmers in other countries) - While the passage notes it's common in developing countries, this doesn't *define* what self-sufficiency farming *is*.



"
Kupita ku malo wosungirako zinthu zakale kungakhale gawo liti lokopa alendo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kukopa alendo ku zachikhalidwe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ngati cholinga chofika kudera linalake ndikudziŵa mbiri yake ndi chikhalidwe chawo, mtundu wazokopa alendo umenewu umatchedwa kuti wachikhalidwe."" (If the goal of visiting a place is to know its history and culture, that type of tourism is called cultural tourism).
* Visiting a museum is directly related to learning about history and culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kukopa alendo ku zamalonda** - Museums aren't primarily about commerce/shopping.
* **B: Kukopa alendo ku zachilengedwe** - Museums are buildings, not natural environments.
* **D: Kukopa alendo kumalo osiyanasiyana** - This is too broad; it doesn't specify *why* someone would visit.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Mwina mwake mtundu wodziwika kwambiri wazokopa alendo ndi womwe anthu ambiri amawuganizira kuti umakhuza kuyenda: Maulendo wopuma. Apa ndi pamene anthu amapita kumalo omwe ndiwosiyana kwambiri ndi malo omwe amapita nthawi zonse kukapuma komaso kukasangalala."" This directly describes recreational travel as being about escaping daily routines and relaxing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuzilowetsa okha mu chikhalidwe (Immersing oneself in culture):** The passage describes *cultural tourism* as being focused on history and traditions, not simply relaxation.
*   **C: Kuyang’ana malo ochititsa kaso (Looking for exciting places):** While some recreational trips might involve excitement, the passage focuses on getting away from everyday life.
*   **D: Kuzindikira mbiri ya malo (Recognizing the history of a place):** This is related to *cultural tourism*, not recreational tourism.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Nkhani zachipambano zoterezi zidachepetsa mantha pakufuna kusintha zinthu, ndikukhala ndi maganizo abwino ofuna kusintha mtsogolo."" (Such success stories reduced fear when wanting to change things and had positive feelings about wanting to change in the future.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuvetsetsa za anthu amene anathandizira chikhalidwe chapa bungwe** (Focusing on people who contributed to the culture of the organization) - While important for understanding history, the passage doesn’t directly link this to *reducing fear*.
* **C: Kuzindikira zimene zinathandizira kayendetsedwe ka bungwe** (Identifying what helped the organization function) -  This is about understanding, not specifically about lessening fear of change.
* **D: Kumvetsesa zambiri ya bungwe** (Understanding the history of the organization) - This is too broad. The passage focuses on a *specific* type of understanding – past *successes* – as the fear reducer.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kuzindikira za mbiri yako kungathandize motani?","The correct answer is **A: Kuchepetsa mantha positha zinthu** (Reducing fear of change).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nkhani zachipambano zoterezi zidachepetsa mantha pakufuna kusintha zinthu, ndikukhala ndi maganizo abwino ofuna kusintha mtsogolo."" (Such success stories reduced fear in wanting to change things, and had positive feelings about wanting to change in the future.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kulimbikitsa zinthu zofunika** (Encouraging important things) - While understanding history *can* help prioritize, the passage doesn't directly state it *encourages* important things.
* **C: Kukhazikika pa malo ogwira ntchito** (Stability in the workplace) - The passage focuses on *change* and overcoming fear, not maintaining stability.
* **D: Kulimbikitsa khalidwe la malonda** (Encouraging the quality of products) -  The passage is about the overall organizational culture and history, not specifically product quality.

Ndi chiyani mwa ndemanga izi zomwe zikulongosola moyenera za kaphuzilide kamakono?,"The correct answer is **C: Njira zina zophunzilira ndi zabwino kuposa zinazo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage argues that hands-on learning is superior.** It states, ""Njira zomwe akugwilitsa ntchito makono zimapereka ufulu ndithu. Palibenso njira ina yabwino yophunzirapo."" This directly supports the idea that some learning methods are better than others.
* The passage criticizes passive learning (watching videos without applying the knowledge) and highlights the value of *doing* things.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maphuzilidwe ena ndi abwino kwambiri kuposa ena** - While generally true, the passage focuses specifically on *learning methods*, not 'failures' in general.
* **B: Kuphunzira kuzikhala pa zinthu zimene timakhulupilira kuti zichitika** - This isn't a central theme of the passage.
* **D: Palibe njira yeniyeni pophunzira** - The passage *explicitly* contradicts this by stating hands-on learning *is* the best way.

Here's why:

The passage argues that simply *knowing* information (like how to fix a car, build a fountain, etc.) isn't enough – true learning happens through *doing* and *applying* that knowledge. The passage criticizes passively consuming information (watching videos) without actively engaging with it. Option D directly addresses this point, suggesting that even skills we might not immediately use are still valuable to learn, which contradicts the passage's emphasis on practical application.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pali njira zambiri zophunzilira mauthenga:** The passage doesn't deny different learning methods exist; it questions their effectiveness if they aren't applied practically.
*   **B: Kamphuzilidwe kazinthu kena ndikofunika kukatsatira koposa kena:** The passage doesn't focus on prioritizing certain subjects over others.
*   **C: Kuphunzira kwabwino kumatengera ophunzirawo komanso maluso opatsidwawo:** This aligns *with* the passage's idea that learning is an interaction between the learner and the knowledge received, it doesn't present a contrasting viewpoint.



"
"Tikadzuka ndicholinga nthawi yogona, ndichiyani mwa izi zimene zingasokoneze magonedwe kamba kosokoneza dongosolo la magonedwe?","The correct answer is **D: Kudzuka kukamwa madzi a mubotolo patebulo la pabedi (Waking up to drink water from a bottle on the bedside table)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that drinking a lot of fluids (like water or tea - diuretics) is something people do when attempting a ""wake back to bed"" (WBTB) technique. This is *intended* to cause a need to urinate, prompting you to get out of bed and then go back to sleep.  Therefore, doing this *during* a WBTB attempt isn't disruptive, it's *part of* the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuwelenga ola limodzi ndi theka tisanagone (Reading for an hour and a half before bed):** This is generally discouraged as the blue light from screens (or even the mental stimulation of reading) can make it harder to fall asleep.
* **B: Kugwiritsa ntchito malo osambilako ndi kubwelera ku bedi (Using the bathroom and returning to bed):** This is a *result* of the WBTB technique (due to drinking water), not something that disrupts it.
* **C: Kuthimitsa alamu pa tebulo lakubedi ndi kugona mphindi makumi awiri (Snoozing an alarm on the bedside table and falling back asleep):**  Snoozing disrupts your sleep cycle and makes you feel groggier. The passage describes using an alarm to *gently* wake you, not to be repeatedly snoozed.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi zomwe sizikupeleka tanthauzo loyenera la kulephere kugona?,"The correct answer is **D: Mukadzuka, cholinga ndi chakuti mugoneso pasanathe maola awiri**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a technique for *returning* to sleep after a brief awakening.** The goal isn't to stay awake for less than two hours – it's to get *back* to sleep quickly.  The whole point is to minimize the time spent awake after a natural, brief wakefulness during the night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zitha kutengera zochitika mobwereza (Zochitika mobweremobwereza):** The passage *does* mention waking up due to things in your environment. This aligns with the description.
* **B: Cholinga sikuti udzuke wekhawekha:** The passage acknowledges the technique works best with a gentle alarm (like a vibration) that *doesn't* fully wake you, which supports the idea of not fully waking up on your own.
* **C: Dongosololi limachitika nthawi yogona:**  The technique is *designed* to be used during sleep - when you have a brief awakening.



"
"Monga ubongo umayesa kulota pamene tigona nthawi zambiri, chimakula ndi chiyani?","The correct answer is **D: Nthawi ya pakati pa REM imanena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ichichi ndichifukwa chomwe chozizwachi chinachitika kamba ka maloto wosadziwika bwino kupangitsa kuti nthawi yitalike pakati pa REM states."" This directly translates to ""This is because the desire to fulfill many dreams often leads to longer times between REM states.""

The question asks what *grows* as the brain tries to dream while sleeping. The passage indicates that the *time between REM states* increases when someone tries to dream too much.  Therefore, the answer is the lengthening of the interval between REM states.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchuluka kwa REM kumanena (The amount of REM increases):** The passage implies the opposite - more attempts to dream lead to *less* frequent REM cycles.
*   **B: Kuchuluka kwa mphamvu (The amount of energy):** The passage doesn't discuss energy levels.
*   **C: Kutalika kubwelera muchimake (Length of return to wakefulness):** The passage discusses time *between* REM states, not the length of time it takes to wake up.



"
Kodi ndi chiyani mwa zoyipa izi zomwe zimalimbikitsa kulota tikagona mumatupi athu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuchepetsa ma REM pa tsiku limodzi** (Reducing REMs per day).

Here's why:

The passage states that having many dreams can be detrimental because it leads to *fewer* REM states during the night. Less time in REM sleep means less restorative sleep.  Therefore, a reduction in REM sleep is the negative consequence discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuchepetsa kutalika kwa nthawi pakati pa REM kumanena** (Reducing the duration of time between REMs) - The passage actually says the opposite - having many dreams *increases* the time between REM states.
* **C: Kudalira kulota pogona** (Relying on dreaming while sleeping) - The passage doesn't talk about *relying* on dreaming, but about the consequences of *having too many* dreams.
* **D: Kuchulutsa ma REM pa tsiku** (Increasing REMs per day) - The passage states dreams reduce REM, not increase them.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi matimu okumana maso ndi maso pochita zinthu ndi matimu ogwiritsa ntchito maluso kugawana mauthenga onse ndiofanana?","The correct answer is **B: Matimu onse awiri ali ndi milingo yosiyana payokha pazochitika zawo zatsiku ndi tsiku.**

Here's why:

The passage states that teams connecting via the internet are *measured* on the same level as face-to-face teams, but there are ""subtle differences."" It goes on to explain that virtual teams often have more autonomy and can meet regardless of time zone differences.  This implies they operate differently in their day-to-day activities compared to traditional, face-to-face teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While they are *measured* the same, the text emphasizes differences in *how* they operate.
* **C:** The passage mentions a ""shadow team"" that reports details, but doesn't say *both* types of teams do this.
* **D:** The passage specifically mentions time zone differences being *less* of a factor for virtual teams, implying they don’t necessarily operate on the same schedule.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndemangayi pankhaniya matimu okumana maso ndi maso komanso kudzela maluso ena siyoona?","The correct answer is **D: Kusiyana kwa nthawi kungathandize matimu okumana kudzela maluso ena**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mamembala atimu amene amalumikizana kudzera njira zamakono nthawi zambiri amagwira ntchito molumikizana pazofunikira zagulu lawo. Amakhala ndi ufulu nthawi zambiri wodziyimilira pawokha kuposa mamembala a mutimu popeza magulu awo akhoza kukumana malinga ndi kusiyana kwa nthawi zomwe sizingamvetsetseke ndi ma bwana akomweko."" This directly supports the idea that differing time zones can *benefit* teams communicating through technology, allowing for continuous work and independent action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matimu okumana maso ndi maso amachita zinthu zapamwamba** - The passage doesn't make a claim about face-to-face teams being *superior*. It just notes differences.
* **B: Matimu okumana nthawi zambiri amakhala ngati okumanilapo matimu okumana maso ndi maso** - The passage actually highlights differences, particularly the increased autonomy of digitally connected teams.
* **C: Matimu okumana maso ndi maso alibe mphamvu zambiri kusiyana ndi matimu okumana kudzela maluso ena** - Again, the passage doesn’t state this. It implies the opposite – digitally connected teams have more individual authority.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on established theories of motivation** – Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory. These theories attempt to *explain* why people are motivated, based on fundamental needs and factors.
* **""Malingaliro atsopano amene amachitika muukulu""** refers to spontaneous, individual thoughts and ideas. While these *can* influence motivation, they aren't a framework for understanding *general* work behaviors. The passage is discussing broad psychological theories.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: M’mene chilengedwe chanu chimatengera zochitika zawo** (How your environment shapes their actions) - This is related to motivation – external factors and surroundings can influence needs and job satisfaction (covered by the theories mentioned).
* **C: Zofuna zamkatikati** (Intrinsic needs) - The passage directly discusses understanding what drives people, including their internal needs and desires (Maslow’s hierarchy addresses this).
* **D: Kumvetsetsa zofuna za anthu** (Understanding people’s needs) -  The core of both theories mentioned is understanding human needs to predict and influence behavior.

Here's why:

* **The rule described in P (the rule of thirds)** is *specifically* about placing key elements of a composition in the areas where the lines intersect in a 3x3 grid. This is done to create a balanced and visually interesting image by ensuring important elements aren't just randomly placed, but are strategically located.
* **Option C** directly reflects this core principle - maintaining elements in *appropriate and important* places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komalizira kwa mapulani a pulojekiti komanso kuyamba kwa pulojekiti pamene chithunzi chimazaikidwa** (Finishing project plans and starting the project when the image is placed) - This is about project management, not composition.
* **B: Kupanga chithunzi chooneka mokongola komanso kupatsa chidwi** (Making the image look beautiful and attractive) - While the rule of thirds *can* contribute to a beautiful image, it's a specific technique *to achieve* that result, not the result itself.
* **D: Kupanga dongosolo posunga zithunzi** (Creating an order for storing images) - This is about organization, not composition.

Ndi chiyani mwa izi chomwe sichikulongosola za kawonekedwe ka zithunzi za 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: Ili ndi magawo osiyanasiyana koposa magawo odziwika**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Mawonekedwe a 35mm alidi, osokoneza, 36mm mulifupi ndi 24mm mulitali. Machitidwe amtunduwu (kugawa khumi ndi ziwiri kupeza nambala yonse yosavuta) ndi 3:2. Mayikidwe ambiri odziwika (banja la APS pa kayikidwe ka zinthu, mwachitsanzo) amafanana kapena kuyandikila mofananilanako pofananiza kutalika ndi kufupika."" This means the 35mm format is actually *similar* to many other common formats, not distinctly different.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Zikadali kupangidwa** - The text says it's ""ikupangidwabe mpaka masiku ano"" (still being made today).
*   **B: Zinatengedwa munjira ina ya dijito kamera** - The text says its aspect ratio ""adatengedwaso ndi njira ya image sensor yamakamera a digital"" (was also adopted by the image sensor method of digital cameras).
*   **D: Ndigawo lodziwika kwambiri padziko lonse** - The text says it is ""mtundu wotchuka kwambiri wa zithunzi zosayenda padziko lapansi"" (the most popular type of still images in the world).

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, pamene opanga katundu akuonjezera maonekedwe abwino a magalasi, nanga magalasi ozumula akozedwa bwanji?","The correct answer is **B: Ali osavuta kugwiritsa ntchito mu malo osawawa kwambiri.**

Here's why:

The passage states that improvements in lens manufacturing (reaching an acceptable level of aberration) are making zoom lenses take better pictures *compared* to prime lenses. It then goes on to say that one drawback of zoom lenses is a smaller aperture (slower light transmission). This slower light transmission makes cheaper zoom lenses *more difficult to use in low-light conditions* without a flash. 

Therefore, as zoom lenses improve, they become easier to use in challenging lighting situations, which is the meaning of ""malo osawawa kwambiri"" (low-light conditions).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ali ndi kuthekera kuthamanga kwambiri** - The passage states the opposite – they have *less* light transmission (slower aperture).
*   **C: Zithunzi zake zimafanana ndi magalasi amene sazumula** - The passage says improvements are making them *better* than prime lenses, not the same.
*   **D: Ali ndi kuzumula kochepa koposa magalasi osazumulika** - The passage discusses aberrations being reduced, but doesn't directly compare the amount of zoom between types of lenses.



"
"Malingana ndizomwe zili mu ndimeyi, kodi magalasi ozumula angafunike nthawi yanji koposa magalasi opanda kuzumula?","The correct answer is **C: Ngati simukufuna kugwiritsa ntchito getsi lowala m’mdima**.

Here's why:

The passage states that zoom lenses have a disadvantage of having a smaller aperture (less light reaching the sensor) compared to prime lenses. This makes cheaper zoom lenses difficult to use in low light situations *without* using a flash.  Therefore, you would need a zoom lens (the one discussed in the passage) more often when you don't want to use a bright light in the dark.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngati mulingo wam’mene magalasi angakhalire omasuka ndiwofunika** - The passage doesn't discuss the level of zoom needed.
*   **B: Ngati mukufuna magalasi ochepa** -  The passage compares zoom and prime lenses, not the *number* of lenses.
*   **D: Ngati mukufuna zinthu zamagawo ambiri zomwe zimalumikizana** - The passage doesn’t discuss complex features.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that mysticism *differs* from other religions and worship. It emphasizes that mysticism is based on *direct experience* (peace, illumination, realization) rather than seeking explanations about origins, doctrines, or deities – things commonly found in traditional religion and prayer.  Focusing on dogma or structured worship would be *contrary* to the core principles of mysticism as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Pali chidwi chofuna kukhala okondwa mwachidziwitso** - This aligns with the passage's mention of seeking ""ntendere, kuunikilidwa, kuupeza ngakhale ku sangalala"" (peace, illumination, realization, even ecstasy).
*   **B: Otsatila Mysticism amayang’ana zidziwitso za uzimu owona** - The passage clearly defines mysticism as a search for ""chowona chenicheni, umulungu, chowona chauzimu, komanso Mulungu"" (true reality, spirituality, spiritual truth, and God).
*   **C: Otsatila Mysticism akhoza kutsatila njira zomwe zingawathandizile kawonekedwe ka zinthu m’mene zilili osati zoganizira** - This reflects the idea that mystics may use practices (""njira"") to aid in their understanding, but they're aiming for direct experience rather than intellectualization (""zoganizira"").

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that mysticism is about *direct, personal experience* of truth, the divine, and God. It's about individual realization through states like peace, illumination, and ecstasy. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* connected to mysticism according to the text:

* **A: Kuyang’ana malo a kawonekedwe ka zinthu m’mene zilili osati zoganizira** - This aligns with the idea of perceiving ""reality as it is,"" which is central to the mystical pursuit of truth.
* **C: Kuyika chidwi pa kukhala okondwa mwachidziwitso** - The passage specifically mentions ""ecstasy"" as a potential state within mysticism.
* **D: Kutsata kuzindikira za Mulungu** - The passage directly states that mysticism involves recognizing God.

Option B, however, describes seeking understanding *through others*, which contradicts the passage's emphasis on *individual* experience and realization. Mysticism isn't about learning about your self from others, but discovering truth *within* yourself.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi amene anakayambitsa za ulimi ndani?","The correct answer is **C: Maori anthu aku Polynesia (Anthu a Maori ochokera ku polynesia)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Choncho, umboni watsopano ukunena zoti a Moriori adali gulu la Maori wochokera ku China amene adachoka ku New Zealand kulowera ku zilumba za Chatham...Chiphunzitsochi chimatsindikiza maganizo woti anthu achi Maori adachoka ku Polynesia ku Great Fleet komanso adalanda New Zealand kwa a Moriori, ndikuyambitsa ulimi pakati pawo.""

This directly states that the Maori from Polynesia are credited with introducing agriculture. The passage then goes on to discuss a revised history of the Moriori, but the original belief was that the Maori brought agriculture to New Zealand.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,gulu limene limasaka moas anali anthu oyamba kukhala malo ati?","The correct answer is **B: Nyuzelandi**.

The passage states: ""Kwa nthawi yaitali muzaka zama 1700 ndi 1800, kunkakhulupililidwa kuti anthu woyamba kukhala ku New Zealand anali a chi Maori amene ankasaka zimbalame zazikuluzikulu zotchedwa moas."" This directly translates to: ""For a long time in the 1700s and 1800s, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Māori who hunted large birds called moas.""



"
Ndi njira iti imene kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka njira ya Pureland origami kakhoza kuthandiza folder?,"The correct answer is **B: Folder ili ndi maluso ena**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Pureland origami was designed for people with limited dexterity or disabilities.** This means it's meant to help people who might not have ""maluso ena"" (other skills) in origami easily create something.
* **Option A** is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention creating multiple folds simultaneously.
* **Option C** is incorrect, as it talks about 'returning folders' which isn't in the text.
* **Option D** is incorrect because the passage focuses on helping beginners, not those who have tried and failed.

Therefore, the primary benefit of Pureland origami is to allow people with limited abilities to still enjoy and succeed at origami, effectively expanding their ""maluso ena"" (other skills)."
Ndichiyani mwa izi zimene sizikulongosola moyenera za Pureland origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndizoyenelera mafolder azindikira** (It is suitable for experienced folders).

Here's why:

*   **The passage explicitly states Pureland origami was *designed* for people with limited origami skills.** It was created to help those who find traditional origami difficult, or have physical limitations. Therefore, it wouldn't be suitable for experienced folders.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Njira yake sikhala ndi folder yobwelera** (Its method does not contain a reverse fold) - The passage states complex folds, including reverse folds, are *not* allowed.
*   **C: Zinthu zokhota zizikhalazodziwika malo ake** (Fixed points are in their designated positions) - The passage states ""all creases are in their easy positions"", implying a predictable and simplified structure.
*   **D: Ndi njira yabwino kwama folder ochepa mayendedwe a misepha** (It is a good method for folders with limited hand movements) - The passage directly mentions it was created for people who struggle with dexterity or have disabilities.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndichiyani mwaizi zomwe zimakhala ndi phindu la nthawi yayitali?","The correct answer is **A: Kugwirizana ndi anthu ena (Cooperating with others)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dyera ndi kuzikonda kudzakhala pakati panthu mpaka kalekale ndipo ndim'mene zimakhalira kuti ngati anthu ambiri apindula pamakhala mwai opindula koposa pochita zinthu modzikonda."" This translates to ""It is beneficial for things to be among people for a long time and this is how it remains that if many people benefit from opportunities to benefit more than by doing things selfishly."" 

This clearly points to the long-term benefit of cooperation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuyika chidwi pa zinthu zanu (Focusing on your own things):** The passage *contrasts* this with the beneficial approach. It says selfishness is *less* beneficial.
* **C: Kulimbikitsa zimene zingathandize gulu la anthu ochepa koposa gulu la anthu ambiri (Promoting things that help a small group of people more than a large group):** This is the opposite of what the passage advocates.
* **D: Kuzindikira kuti umbombo ukhoza kukhala othandiza (Realizing that alliances can be helpful):** While alliances *could* be part of cooperation, the passage speaks more broadly about benefiting *everyone*, not just specific alliances.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi zomwe wina akhoza kuziyambilira ngati akufuna ubwino wamsanga?","Correct answer: **D: Kusaganizira ena**

Here's why:

The passage states that benefits come from prioritizing collective good (""pakati panthu"") *over* self-interest (""kudzichita zinthu modzikonda""). If someone wants *immediate* benefit, the passage implies they would act selfishly – meaning they wouldn't consider others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuganizira anthu ena (Considering others):** The passage says this leads to long-term benefits, not immediate ones.
*   **B: Kugwilira ntchito limodzi ndi anthu ena (Working together with others):**  This is also a path to long-term benefit, aligned with the passage's overall message.
*   **C: Kupangira pamodzi (To compromise):** While compromise can be part of working together, it doesn't guarantee immediate benefit.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndi ndani amene anapeleka ndalama kwambiri zopita ku nkhondo?","The correct answer is **D: Anthu aku Filipino**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zonse zomwe America idagwilitsa ntchito ku nkhondo yogonjetsa anthu aku Phillipines zidalipilidwa ndi a Filipino omwewo. Anakakamizidwa kupereka msonkho..."" This directly indicates that the Filipino people were the ones who funded the war through forced taxation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Boma la Philippine:** While the taxes were collected *through* the Philippine government, the passage states the Filipino people were *forced* to pay them to the U.S.
*   **B: Ma bank aWall Street:** Wall Street banks handled the funds, but they didn't *provide* the original money.
*   **C: Ulamuliro wakale wachimereka:** This isn't mentioned in relation to funding the war.



"
Ndi nthawi yanji inabwera isanafike nyengo ya Tempula?,"The correct answer is **C: Nthawi yambiri ya anthu aku Ulaya** (Early Middle Ages).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zaka zam'ma Middle Age zidabwera m'mbuyo mwa Early Middle Age...""  This directly translates to ""The Middle Ages came *after* the Early Middle Ages.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nthawi ya mbiri ya anthu aku Ulaya** (History of the people of Europe) - This is too broad.
*   **B: Zaka zam’ma 1200** (The 1200s) - The passage mentions the 1200s *within* the High Middle Ages, not *before* it.
*   **D: Zaka zam’ma 1300** (The 1300s) - Similar to B, this falls within the Middle Ages period, not before it.



"
Ndi nthawi yanji inabwera itadutsa nyengo ya Tempula?,"The correct answer is **B: Zaka zam’ma 1200**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""High Middle Ages nthawi ya mbiri ya ku Ulaya mzaka zamumazana 11,12 ndiponso 13 (AD 1000-1300).""  This means the 12th century (the 1100s) fell *within* the High Middle Ages. Since the question asks what came *after* the Early Middle Ages, and the High Middle Ages followed, the 1200s (representing the 12th century) is the best answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nthawi ya mbiri ya anthu aku Ulaya** - Too broad; the passage discusses a specific *period* within European history.
* **C: Nthawi ya mbiri ya anthu aku Ulaya** - Same as A.
* **D: Mu zaka zam’ma 1100** - While the 1100s were *part* of the High Middle Ages, they weren't what came *after* the Early Middle Ages as a whole - the High Middle Ages encompassed the 1100s, 1200s, and 1300s.



"
Ndi njira iti yochiza imene siyinatchulidwe kuti ikugwiritsidwa ntchito ndi madotolo komanso opanga opareshoni pa nyengo ya ulamuliro wachi Roma?,"Correct answer: **A: Kuchiza matenda olephera kuchira chifukwa cha zokhoma ndi mankhwala ogonetsa**

Here's why:

The passage mentions the following treatments used by Roman doctors:

*   Morphine from poppy seeds
*   Scopolamine from herbane seeds
*   Surgery to remove affected body parts (like in gangrene cases)
*   Techniques to control bleeding (ligatures and cauterization)

Option A, ""Treating incurable diseases due to cancer and chemotherapy,"" is the only option not mentioned or implied in the text. Chemotherapy is a modern treatment, and cancer as a specific understood disease wasn't identified in the same way during Roman times.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage explicitly mentions scopolamine being derived from herbane.
*   **C:** The passage describes techniques to control bleeding, which can be interpreted as managing blood flow during surgery.
*   **D:** The passage specifically states doctors were skilled at removing limbs to save patients from gangrene."

Kodi kuthekera koti munthu mkowona kumadalira chiyani?,"The correct answer is **A: Magawo owona zamawonedwe mthupi** (The components of the visual system within the body).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Masomphenya, ndi kuthekera kuwona kumadalira ziwalo zamaganizidwe ndiponso maso."" (Vision, the ability to see, depends on the parts of the brain and eyes.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Zofunikira za chinthu chamoyo** (Needs of a living organism) - While vision *helps* meet the needs of a living organism, the passage specifically focuses on the *mechanism* of vision, not the general needs.
* **C: Maonedwe a zinthu malingana ndi mtunda** (Perception of things according to distance) - The passage *mentions* depth perception (recognizing the length of different fields), but it's just one aspect of how vision depends on physical components.
* **D: Kusiyana kwa chitandizo chofunikira** (Differences in required treatment) -  The passage discusses different needs for correction, but this is a *result* of the underlying physical differences, not what vision fundamentally depends on.



"
Kodi kusiyana kwa kaonekedwe ka diso pakati pa zinthu zamoyo zimadalira chiyani?,"The correct answer is **B: Zofunikira za zinthu zamoyo** (The needs of living things).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...maonekedwe osiyana potengera ndi **zofunikira za thupi**."" ( ""...different formations depending on the **needs of the body**."") This directly links the variation in eye shape to the requirements of the organism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mawonedwe a zinthu** (The appearance of things) - While eyes *allow* us to see appearances, the passage doesn't say appearance dictates eye shape.
*   **C: Nthawi yomwe odwala afuna chithandizo** (When patients seek treatment) - This is irrelevant to the natural variation in eye shape.
*   **D: Magawo ambiri olumikizana a chinthu chamoyo** (Many interconnected parts of a living thing) - While true, this is a broad statement and doesn't specifically explain *why* eye shapes differ. The passage points to a specific driver – needs.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ana osowa chisamaliro angavutike ndi chiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Ntchito ya sukulu** (Schoolwork).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ana amene ali ndi vuto la ADD amavutika kulimbikila maphunziro..."" which translates to ""Children with ADD struggle to concentrate on schoolwork...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masewero osewera** (Games) - The passage explicitly states they can focus well on things they enjoy, like games.
* **C: Kuwonera makatuni** (Watching cartoons) -  Similarly, the passage says they focus well on enjoyable activities like watching movies/cartoons.
* **D: Zinthu zimene amakonda kuchita** (Things they like to do) - This is too broad. While they focus on things they like, the passage specifically highlights the *difficulty* with schoolwork.

This directly explains that the disruptive behaviors are a way for children with ADD to *stimulate* their brains because their brains don't get stimulated easily by conventional methods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuchepetsa kuthamanga kwazochitika** - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **B: Kuwathandiza kuti alumikizane ndi ena** - The passage says ADD *hinders* social relationships.
*   **C: Kuwonedwa ndi makolo awo** - While attention is a component of ADD, the passage doesn't suggest this is the *reason* for bad behavior.

"Malingana ndizomwe zili mu ndimeyi, ndichiyani mwa izi sichitsanzo cha katundu oyenda amene ogwira ntchito amagwiritsa ntchito?","The correct answer is **D: Mphuzitsi wa masewera a wana (A children's game tutor)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes scaffolding as support that helps learners with *complex tasks* or *starting new ones*, like using a computer or beginning a new project. It also mentions support that helps with *challenging concepts*.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

*   **A: Malangizo koyambilira kwa gemu ya komputa (Initial instructions for a computer game):** This provides support to begin a new, potentially complex task (learning the game).
*   **B: Mphunzitsi wa SAT (SAT tutor):** SATs are complex, and a tutor provides guidance and support to help a student learn the material and improve.
*   **C: Pologilamu yochitira padera (Personalized learning program):** These programs adapt to a student's needs and provide support based on their progress – scaffolding.

**A tutor for a children's game**, however, is likely focused on simple, already-understood concepts. It doesn't represent the complex support needed for a difficult task or concept as described in the passage. The passage discusses scaffolding for things that are *challenging* for the learner.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states scaffolding *is* a teaching method.** It's not just support, it's a specific *way* of teaching that involves providing temporary support to help learners achieve something they couldn't do on their own.  The passage describes scaffolding as a teaching *strategy* alongside being support.

Let's look at why the other options are good descriptions of scaffolding as explained in the text:

* **A: Katundu oyenda yendayu akhoza kupezeza kudzelamu maluso ena** - This aligns with the idea of scaffolding helping learners master new skills.
* **C: Imadziwikatso kuti kulandira malangizo kuthandiza ana asukulu mwayi waupangiri kudzela muma pulojekiti** -  This describes how scaffolding allows students to accomplish tasks (projects) they wouldn't be able to do independently.
* **D: Katundu oyenda amene ogwira ntchito amagwiritsa ntchito amapeleka thandizo koyambilira kwa zomphunzira** - The passage talks about scaffolding as providing support, like breaking down complex tasks or starting new ones.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ubwino uti wa Myspace kwa ana asukulu olephela kuwerenga?","The correct answer is **A: Kusintha chinthu kuti chifanane ndi zofuna zako**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Mutha kupanga momwe mufunira kuti zikhale zosavuta kuwerenga komaso ndi utoto wambiri kapena wochepa malingana ndim'mene mufunira."" This directly translates to being able to customize the appearance to suit individual needs, which would be especially helpful for students who struggle with reading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsamba lapa intaneti** - This is just a general description of MySpace, not a benefit for struggling readers.
* **C: Mauthenga a malo apegi la tsamba lapa intaneti** - The passage doesn't highlight this as a specific benefit.
* **D: Zofotokozera anthu osiyanasiya okwana mamiliyoni 54** - This is a statistic about MySpace's popularity, not a feature helping readers.

Ndichiyani mwa izi zomwe sizinali zopangitsa ziwawa ku Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Kulembedwa kwa Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that Krushchev *agreed* to the selection of Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.** This was a concession *to* the protests, not a cause of them. It was a result of the unrest, not a trigger for it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chilichonse chimakhala cha anthu** - This is too broad and doesn't relate to the specific issues mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Kusowa kwa chakudya** - The passage directly states that workers protested the ""shortage of food.""
*   **C: Kudula malipilo** - The passage also directly states workers protested ""wage cuts.""

Therefore, the appointment of Gomulka was the outcome of the unrest, not a cause of it."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi sizinakhudze maubale pakati pa USSR ndi United States of America?","The correct answer is **B: Maganizo okhudza Jeremani**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states that Germany's actions *initially brought* the USSR and USA into alliance.**  It doesn't say differing opinions *about* Germany caused conflict *after* the war. In fact, it was after Germany was defeated that tensions rose.
*   **A: Kusiyana kwa zikhalidwe (Differences in culture)** - The passage mentions ""culture"" as a factor contributing to disagreements.
*   **C: Kusiyana kwa madondosolo (Differences in ideologies)** - The passage implies ideological differences as part of the issues that led to the Cold War.
*   **D: Kusiyana maganizo muzochitika (Differences in actions)** - The passage talks about disagreements over ""events,"" which clearly impacted the relationship.

Therefore, opinions *about* Germany weren't a cause of the break down in relations, but rather the reason they initially cooperated."
Ndi chiyani mwa izi sizikufotokoza moyenera pa ntchito yotumiza mauthenga kuthupi lonse?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuchedwetsa kayendedwe kamagazi** (Slowing down blood flow).

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) states the nervous system ensures blood flows *without interruption*.** Slowing down blood flow directly contradicts this function.
* The other options are all consistent with the passage:
    * **B: Kulongosola za kayendedwe ka magazi** (Monitoring blood flow) -  The nervous system needs to be aware of blood flow.
    * **C: Kukoza zonse za muthupi kukhala muchimake** (Keeping all parts of the body in balance) -  This reflects the overall regulatory role of the nervous system.
    * **D: Kuopetsa thupi kupwetekeka** (Protecting the body from harm) - This aligns with the passage's statement about the nervous system providing protection.

Therefore, only option A describes something the nervous system *wouldn't* do in relation to its messaging function.



"
Kodi tingapeze chiyani pa phiri la Giza?,"The correct answer is **B: Kachisi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Plateau ya Giza... muli mapiramidi, manda ang'onoang'ono angapo, **makachisi angapo** ndi Sphinx yayikulu.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manda** - The passage mentions small tombs (manda), but doesn't indicate they are the primary thing found there.
*   **C: Zodwabwitsa zonse zisanu ndi ziwiri** - While the Great Pyramid is *one* of the Seven Wonders, the passage doesn't say *all* of them are at Giza.
*   **D: Manda akulu koposa** - The passage says ""ang'onoang'ono"" (small) regarding the tombs.



"
Kodi ntchito ya manda opambanawa inali chiyani?,"The correct answer is **D: Kusunga manda anthu amene anamwalira**.

The text states: ""...mapiramidi ang'onoang'ono, manda angapo, ndiponso akachisi zidamangidwa popereka ulemu kwa mkazi wa Khufu ndi abale akubanja."" This implies the smaller pyramids and tombs (manda) were built to house the remains of Khufu's family.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukhala m’modzi wa zinthu zodabwitsa padziki lapansi** - While true, this is a characteristic of the pyramids as a whole, not the specific purpose of the tombs.
*   **B: Ulemu wa Pharaoh** - The main pyramid was for the Pharaoh, but the smaller tombs were for his family.
*   **C: Zinthu zofunika komanso zooneka** - This is too vague and doesn't relate to the primary function of the tombs."
Kodi ndi ndani amene akuyang’ana za ziziwitso za aupandu amene anawononga kachisi?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the people of Ephesus *tried* to erase Herostratus's name from history.
* However, the Greek historian **Strabo** wrote down the name, which is why we know it today. Therefore, he is the one who preserved the information about the arsonist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ephesus:** They wanted to *forget* the arsonist, not record information about him.
* **B: Alexander the Great:** He offered to rebuild the temple, but wasn't interested in the arsonist's details.
* **D: Artemis:** She is the goddess to whom the temple was dedicated, not a recorder of historical information.

*   **A: Kumangaso ndalama yake anapeleka ndi mfumu Alexander the Great** - M'nkhaniyo ikuti Alexander anapempha kuti amangenso kachisiyo koma kanidwa.
*   **C: Herostratus anawuzidwa kupeleka chuma chomangira** - M'nkhaniyo silankhula za Herostratus kuti apeleka chuma chomangira.
*   **D: Inamangidwa mu zaka za 320 BCE** - M'nkhaniyo ikuti inamangidwa mu 323 BCE, osati za 320 BCE."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi liti lomwe zinthu zamoyo zinayenda ndi miyendo iwiri?","The correct answer is **A: Zaka mamiliyoni asanu ndi awiri zapitazo**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Sahelanthropus nkutheka kuti anayenda ndi miyendo iwiri koyambilira kwa zaka 7 miliyoni zapitazo"" which translates to ""Sahelanthropus possibly walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago."" This is the earliest time mentioned for bipedalism in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Zaka mamiliyoni awiri zapitazo** - This refers to when *Homo Erectus* started walking upright habitually, not the earliest evidence of bipedalism.
*   **C: Zaka mamiliyoni 3.9 zapitazo** - The passage mentions bipedal traits appeared in *Australopithecus* around 4.2-3.9 million years ago, but that's not the *earliest* possible time.
*   **D: Zaka mamiliyoni 4.2 zapitazo** - Similar to C, this is a time for *Australopithecus*, but not the earliest mention."
Kodi ndi gulu liti la zamoyo limene nthawi zambiri limayenda ndi miyendo iwiri?,"The correct answer is **A: Munthu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the evolution of *humans* walking upright (bipedalism).** It discusses the transition from earlier hominins (Australopithecus, Sahelanthropus) to *Homo erectus* and the development of regular upright walking.
* While ""Anthu akale"" (ancient people) is related, it's too broad. The passage details a *process* of becoming bipedal, not a group defined by it.
* ""Nyama ya miyendo iwiri"" (two-legged animal) is too general – many animals walk on two legs sometimes. The passage is about a specific evolutionary development within hominins.
* ""Munthu oyamba"" (first person) is vague and doesn't define a group that consistently walks upright.

The question asks which group *typically* walks on two legs, and the passage directly links the development of bipedalism to the emergence of humans. Therefore, ""Munthu"" is the most accurate answer.

Kodi gulu la asilikali apamadzi aku Jeremani amafuna kukwaniritsa chiyani nthawi ya nkhondo ya dziko lonse yachiwiri?,"The correct answer is **B: Kulepheletsa Angelezi kulandira anthu ndi katundu** (To prevent the English from receiving people and goods).

Here's why:

The passage states the German U-boats were ""trying to prevent the people [Americans] from getting through."" The purpose of preventing the Americans from getting through was to disrupt Britain's ability to receive aid – both people and supplies. This aligns with the overall strategic goal of weakening Britain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kulanda katundu wochokera kwa Angelezi** (To plunder goods from the English) - The passage doesn't mention the Germans trying to *steal* goods, only prevent delivery.
*   **C: Kusamutsa akatundu kudzera pa nyanja ya Antilatiki** (To transport goods through the Atlantic Ocean) - The German U-boats were blocking transport, not facilitating it.
*   **D: Kulepheletsa anthu achiamerica kulandira anthu ndi katundu** (To prevent Americans from receiving people and goods) - While the U-boats *did* intercept American shipments, the ultimate goal was to hinder Britain, not directly target America's receipt of goods."
"Kutengera ndi zomwe mwapatsidwa pa ndimeyi, ndi ndani amene anali opambana pankhondo yapamadzi nthawi ya North Atlantic?","The correct answer is **A: Angelezi ndi wakuamelika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Americans were trying to get people and supplies *to* Britain, and German U-boats were trying to *stop* them. The passage also implies that if the Germans had succeeded, they might have conquered Britain. This strongly suggests that the Americans and British were the ones preventing the Germans from achieving their objective, therefore ""winning"" the battle for the Atlantic.



"
Zimene kunalibe nthawi yimene Assyrian amagwiritsa ntchito asilikali a pa hachi?,"The correct answer is **A: Mphando wapa hachi**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Chishalo chinali chisanapangidwe, kotero asilikali apakavalo a ku Asirya anamenya nkhondo opanda kumbuyo kwa akavalo awo."" This translates to ""Stirrups hadn't been invented yet, so Assyrian cavalry fought without stirrups."" 

Therefore, the Assyrians *didn't* use stirrups (mphando wapa hachi) when employing cavalry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mauta:** The text mentions Assyrian bows as a weapon, they *did* use them.
*   **C: Akavalo:** The Assyrians clearly used horses (akavalo) for their cavalry.
*   **D: Chozitetezera ku nkhondo:** While they had armor, the passage doesn't say they *didn't* use protective gear. It focuses on the lack of stirrups.



"
Kodi nkhondo zogwiritsa ntchito a kavalo zimamenyedwa bwanji?,"The correct answer is **C: Wokwera ngamila** (Mounted on horses).

The passage explicitly states: ""Gulu la ankhondo la asilikali lokwera pamahachi ndi limene limamenya nkhondo lili pahachi"" which translates to ""A group of soldiers riding horses is the one that fights on horseback."" This directly describes how warfare using cavalry is conducted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Woyenda ndi miyendo** (Walking) - This is the opposite of cavalry warfare.
*   **B: Popanda zovala zozitetezera** (Without protective clothing) - While early cavalry might not have had much armor, it's not *defining* how they fight.
*   **D: Ndi asilikali wochepa** (With few soldiers) - The size of the force isn't what defines cavalry warfare.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndikuti kumene simungapeze mzika yaku Babylon?","The correct answer is **D: Kupeleka msembe ku malo a munthu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses entirely on worship *of gods* at temples (kachisi).** It describes offerings *to the gods* and priests interpreting the gods' wishes.
* Option D, offering a sacrifice at a person's place, is the only option that deviates from this focus on divine worship within the temple context. The passage doesn't mention worshipping people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kupeleka nsembe ku malo a kachisi (Offering sacrifices at a temple)** - The passage explicitly states people offer sacrifices at temples.
* **B: Kukhala nawo pa mwambo mukachisi woyambilira (Participating in a ceremony at a temple)** -  The passage mentions ceremonies and festivals being held at temples.
* **C: Chikondwelero pamalo a kachisi (Celebration at a temple)** - The passage specifically mentions festivals as a way to appease the gods.



"
Kodi ndiziti mwaizi zomwe zinali zokhuza ansembe basi?,"The correct answer is **C: Mwambo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...ansembe amachilimika kupeza zofuna za milunguyo popanga **miyambo** komanso maphwando."" (priests strive to discover the desires of the gods by creating **ceremonies** and festivals.) This directly links ceremonies to the work of the priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chikondwelero (Celebration):** While festivals are mentioned, the priests' *creation* of ceremonies is more specific to their role.
* **B: Malo amunthu (Public places):** The text describes sacred spaces, but doesn't suggest these were *only* for the public.
* **D: Malo opemphelelamo (Places of worship):** These places were used by everyone, not just the priests. The khonde (sanctuary) was specifically for the head priest.



"
Kodi ndi liti lomwe mfumu Tutankamun imadziwika ndi mbiri zoyipa?,"The correct answer is **C: Potsatira kupezeka kwa manda ake**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Choncho, kupezeka kwa mandawo mu chaka cha 1922 zinapangitsa iye kukhala wotchuka."" (Therefore, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)

This directly links his fame to the discovery of his tomb, not to any previous notoriety or being listed on a royal list.
"
Kodi zinapanditsa mfumu Tutankamun kukhala yodziwika muufumu wa Eguputo ndi chiyani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kupezeka kwa manda ake osaonongeka** (The discovery of his intact tomb).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Choncho, kupezeka kwa mandawo mu chaka cha 1922 zinapangitsa iye kukhala wotchuka."" (Therefore, the discovery of the tomb in 1922 made him famous).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ulemu wake pa ndandanda ya mafumu akale** (His honor on the list of ancient kings) - The passage specifically says he *wasn't* included on the list of kings.
* **C: Kubedwa kwa zinthu zakhanikhani zopangidwa zotsalira m’manda** (The burial of extravagant artifacts in the tomb) - While the artifacts were extravagant, the *discovery* of the tomb itself is what made him famous.
* **D: Ubwino wake nthawi yakale ya Eguputo** (His goodness in ancient Egyptian times) - The passage states he wasn’t considered important in his time.



"
Kodi ndi chiyani chimene olemba ma ndakatulo waku Greek analephera kupanga?,"The passage focuses on the accomplishments of ancient Greeks in various fields - literature, science, and crafts. It specifically mentions Homer as a poet. The question asks what poets *failed* to create. 

The passage doesn't give any information about limitations of Greek poets. However, we can infer that poets create *written* works. The options relate to physical senses/abilities. The most logical answer is one that isn't directly related to their profession.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Kumva (Hearing)**. While they may or may not have had perfect hearing, their work wasn't *dependent* on it in the same way it was on the ability to think and write (which aren't listed as options). The other options (seeing, walking, speaking) aren't directly connected to the act of writing poetry.



"
Kodi ndi Mgiliki wuti wotchuka pa nkhani zina osati zolemba?,"The correct answer is **C: A Payisagorasi** (Pythagoras).

Here's why:

* **The question asks for a Greek famous for something *other than* writing.**
* **Homer** (B) and **Sophocles** (A) and **Aristophanes** (D) are all writers (poet and playwrights, respectively).
* **Pythagoras** (C) was a mathematician and philosopher, known for his theorem about triangles. This is a non-writing achievement.

Therefore, Pythagoras is the correct answer as he is the only option listed known for something besides writing."
Kodi mabanja a Heberi ankataya nthawi yambiri kuti?,"The correct answer is **B: M’misewu** (In the streets).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Moyo wambiri wa mabanja achi Heberi unali wapa ntetete. Akazi amaphikira panja; masitolo anali otsegula moyang'ana mumsewu."" This translates to ""Much of the life of the Hebrew families was outside. Women cooked outside; shops were open facing the street.""  This indicates they spent a lot of time in the streets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pabwalo** (At the courtyard) - The passage doesn't mention courtyards being a primary gathering place.
*   **C: Munda wapakhomo** (Homestead/Farm) - While they likely worked on farms, the passage focuses on their *social* life being outdoors, not necessarily agricultural work.
*   **D: M’nyumba** (In the house) - The passage specifically states their life was *outside* the house (""pantu tetete"").



"
Kodi chomwe chinali chosafunikira kwambiri ku mabanja a Heberi chinali chiyani?,"The correct answer is **A: Nyengo yawo** (Their homes).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Munyengo zotentha zaku Middle East, nyumba siyinali yofunikira kwenikweni."" This directly translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, homes were not really necessary.""  The passage then elaborates on how much time was spent outdoors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zosunga zawo** (Their possessions) - The passage doesn't mention possessions being unnecessary.
* **C: Makomo awo** (Their mountains) - The passage doesn't discuss mountains.
* **D: Zophika zawo** (Their cooking) - The passage mentions cooking happening *outside*, but doesn't say cooking itself was unnecessary.



"
Kodi mwaizi ndichiti chomwe sichinafotokozeredwe ngati zosiyanitsa pakati pamayiko aku Sikandinaviya?,"The correct answer is **B: Nthaka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all considered 'Scandinavia', there weren't significant differences in **people (anthu), customs (miyambo), and history (mbiri)**. 

However, the passage *doesn't* mention anything about the land/territory (**nthaka**) being similar or different. Therefore, land is the factor *not* listed as being undifferentiated.



"

Kodi lidali gulu liti lomwe limakonda kudya osakhala pa mpando?,"The correct answer is **C: Azibambo wolemera a Chiroma**.

This directly translates to: ""while poor people and women ate food while sitting on the floor, wealthy men preferred to host parties while reclining on couches while eating.""

Therefore, wealthy men (azibambo wolemera) were the group who preferred to eat while not sitting on the floor/in chairs."
Kodi nziti mwaizi zomwe sizidali gawo la chikondwelero la Chiroma Lakalekale?,"The correct answer is **D: Mbale ya nkhukutembo yowotcha**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""panalibe munthu wachi Roma wakale amene walawapo nkhuku tembo."" (No ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alendo wosauka kumadya atakhala pa mipando** - The passage says ""anthu wosauka ndi mayiyo amadya chakudya ali m'mipando"" (poor people and slaves ate food while sitting on the floor).
*   **B: Nkhono zopatsa mudyo** - The passage mentions that snails were eaten by Romans (""nkhono"").
*   **C: Azibambo wolemera kumagona pomwe akudya mgonero** - The passage says ""amuna wolemera amakonda kupanga maphwando pamodzi pamene amakhala m'masofa cham'mbali kwinaku akudya"" (wealthy men preferred to host banquets while reclining on couches while eating).



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiti mwaizi chomwe sichingakhale ndi mphamvu yampakampaka?","The correct answer is **B: Kachikhalidwe kakang’ono**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zikhalidwe zina zing'onozingono zimatha popanda kusiya umboni mu mbiri ya dziko motero sizizindikilika ngati chitukuko."" This directly translates to ""Some minor cultures may disappear without leaving evidence in the country's history, therefore they are not recognized as civilization."" 

This means a small, insignificant culture lacks the lasting impact needed to be considered a civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gulu la anthu lokhala pamodzi** (A group of people living together) - This is a fundamental component of civilization.
* **C: Mzinda womwe ndiwoyima pawokha** (A self-standing city) - Cities are key elements in the development and expression of civilization.
* **D: Chikhalidwe chachitukuko** (A developed culture) - This *is* civilization by definition.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi chimabwera pambuyo pa dziko ndichiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Chikhalidwe chachitukuko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madera a mtawuni ndi amene amapanga dziko kukhala a chikhalidwe chotsogola..."" This directly translates to ""Urban areas make a country become a **culture of civilization**..."" 

Therefore, according to the passage, a culture of civilization (chikhalidwe chachitukuko) follows the country (dziko).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khalidwe limodzi:** This refers to the general characteristic of civilization, not what comes *after* a country.
* **C: Mzinda womwe ndiwoyima pawokha:** While cities are mentioned as part of civilization, they aren't what follows a country.
* **D: Khalidwe laling’ono:** The passage explicitly states these types of cultures don't leave a mark on history and aren't recognized as civilization.



"
Ndi ndemanga iti ya Drukgyal Dzong yomwe siyowona?,"The correct answer is **A: Inamangidwa kusangalala kupambana kwa asilikali a Tibetan- Mongol**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Drukgyal Dzong was built as a **commemoration of victory *against*** the Tibetan-Mongol armies, not *to celebrate* the armies themselves. It was a defensive structure built to remember the win.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Ili ku Bhutan** - The passage clearly states it's in Bhutan.
*   **C: Moto unaononga ambiri otsala** - The passage says the fire in 1951 left only a few significant items remaining.
*   **D: Inapangidwa ndi Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The passage explicitly states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the dzong.



"
Ndi ndemanga iti imene ikufotokoza bwino zotsatira za moto ku Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Chimene chinatsala ndi chithunzi cha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** (What remained was the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states, ""Moto unapangitsa kuti zinthu zofunika zochepa zokha za Drukgyal Dzong zitsale monga chithunzi cha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" (The fire caused only a few important things of Drukgyal Dzong to remain, such as the portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Asilikali a Tibetan-Mongol anapambana** - The passage states Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *won* against them.
* **C: Chinthu chochititsa chidwi sichinakhuzidwe** - The passage clearly states the fire *damaged* the Dzong significantly.
* **D: Chinasungidwa ndi Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** - Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel *built* the Dzong, he didn't save it from the fire.

Ndi chiyani mwa ndemanga izi zokhuza dziko la Cambodia zili zoona?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma Thai anamenya Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Thailand idalowako kuka Cambodia kwa nthawi zambiri mzaka za m'mazana khumi ndi chisanu ndi chitatu ndipo mu chaka cha 1772 adawononga Phnom Phen."" This directly confirms that Thai forces destroyed Phnom Penh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anthu aku Viyetenamu anawononga Phnom Phen** - The passage says Vietnamese people fought *in* Cambodia, but doesn't state they destroyed Phnom Penh.
*   **B: Cambodia inachita nkhondo ndi dziko la Thailand mu chaka cha 1772** - The passage states Thailand *attacked* Cambodia in 1772, not that Cambodia fought a war *with* Thailand.
*   **C: Cambodia inamenyedwa ndi dziko la Viyetinamu koyambilira kwa zaka zam’ma 1800** - The passage states the Vietnamese invaded in the *late* 18th century (zaka zomaliza zam'mazana khumi ndi mphambu zisanu ndi zitatu) not the early 1800s.



"

The passage explicitly states: ""Pangano la Shimonoseki, limene likupereka mphamvu ku dziko la Japan kuti lizilamulira Taiwan..."" (The Shimonoseki Treaty, which gave Japan the power to rule Taiwan...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While the treaty *resulted* from Japan's victory, the treaty itself didn't *state* the victory.
*   **B:** The passage states Taiwan became part of the Qing dynasty *before* the treaty.
*   **C:** The passage does not mention anything about Taiwan taking land.

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""...koma osati amphaka akuluakulu"" (but not large cats). This directly contradicts option D.
*   **The other options are supported by the text:**
    *   **A: Ndizochezeka kwambiri** - The passage mentions they live in large groups like families, implying social behavior and comfort within the group.
    *   **B: Chikhalidwe chawo chimafanana ndi nkhandwe** - The passage explicitly compares their behavior to wolves.
    *   **C: Zonse zazimuna ndi zazikazi ndizowopsa kwambiri kwa nyama zomwe zimadya** - The passage states they are dangerous to predatory animals.

Therefore, option D is the only statement *not* supported by the information in the passage, and is in fact directly contradicted by it."
Kodi akalulu amadyedwa kwambiri ndi nyama ziti?,"The correct answer is **A: Amphaka ang’onoang’ono**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pali amphaka ambiri ang'ono (kuphatikiza amphaka ongoziyendera m'makomo) amene amadya nyama zazing'ono ngati tizilombo, makoswe, abuluzi, ndi **mbalame**.""  Since kalulu gwape is a small animal, it falls into the category of ""nyama zazing'ono"" that the small cats eat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amphaka akuluakulu** - The passage mentions they eat things *like* deer, which are larger.
*   **C: Amphaka apakatikati** -  These eat things *like* kalulu gwape and deer, but are not stated as the primary predator of kalulu gwape.
*   **D: Mphalapala** - Mphalapala are not mentioned in the passage in relation to eating kalulu gwape.



"
Kodi amphaka ang’onoang’ono amasaka ziti mwa izi?,"The correct answer is **A: Makoswe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the smaller cats (including those that roam the mountains) eat small animals *like* insects, rodents, snails, and birds.  ""Makoswe"" means rodents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Akalulu (Kalandulas)** - The passage mentions kalulu gwape as being *eaten* by the cats, not hunted *by* the small cats.
* **C: Mphalapala (Deer)** -  Deer are mentioned as being eaten by the larger cats.
* **D: Mbawala (Fish)** - The passage doesn't mention fish at all.



"
Ndichiyani mwa izi simbali imodzi ya njira yosaka yama ocelot?,"The correct answer is **B: Kutsatira fungo la nyama zawo** (Following the scent of their prey).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Asayansi akuganiza kuti ma ocelots amatsata ndikupeza nyama kuti adye (nyama) ponunkhiza, pamalo pomwe akhala pansi."" (Scientists think ocelots track and locate prey (animals) by scent, in the places where they've been.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuzibisa mkati mwa chilengedwe** (Camouflaging within the environment): While the passage mentions they move stealthily, it doesn't specifically state they *camouflage* themselves.
*   **C: Kutsalira nyama zawo nthawi yausiku** (Hunting their prey at night): The passage says they have good night vision, enabling them to hunt, but doesn’t state it's *only* at night.
*   **D: Kumangogwira nyama zimene zili zamatupi ocheperako** (Only catching smaller animals): This describes *what* they hunt, not *how* they hunt. The passage notes they eat animals smaller than themselves, but that's a result of their hunting style, not the method itself.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Asayansi akuganiza kuti ma ocelots amatsata ndikupeza nyama kuti adye (nyama) ponunkhiza..."" This means scientists believe ocelots *use* their sense of smell to find prey, not that their sense of smell is poor.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Amatha kusaka bwinobwino usiku** - The passage says ""Akhoza kuwona bwinobwino mu mdaka ndi kuona kwa usiku..."" (They can see well in the dark and have night vision).
*   **B: Amayenda mwakachetechete** - The passage says ""...kusuntha mozemba kwambirinso"" (move very stealthily).
*   **D: Zimakonda kusaka nyama zing’onozing’ono** - The passage explicitly states ""Amphaka akutchire asayizi yocheperako amakonda kudya nyama zing'onozing'ono"" (They prefer to eat small animals, and the animals they hunt are generally smaller than themselves).



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi sizingatengedwe ngati mbali imodzi ya mphamvu ya chilombo cha nyalugwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Kubangula (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that a leopard's roar isn't a powerful roar like a lion's, but rather ""like speaking hoarsely."" This implies it's not a demonstration of *strength* in the same way as the other abilities listed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kukwera m’mwamba (Climbing):** The text says leopards are good climbers.
*   **C: Kudumpha (Jumping):** The text says leopards can jump long distances.
*   **D: Kukoka (Pulling):** The text says leopards can pull strongly like a powerful person.

Therefore, roaring is the only ability described that isn’t directly linked to physical strength."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi nyalungwe ndi mikango zimasiyana bwanji?","The correct answer is **B: Kumveka kwakubangula kwawo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amphaka anayiwa ndi okhawo amene amatha kubangula. Kubangula kwa nyalugwe sikuli ngati ku bangula mwamphanvu kwa nkango koma kuli ngati kulankhula mokalipa."" 

This directly contrasts the roaring abilities of lions (nkango) with the more subdued vocalizations of leopards (nyalugwe).  The other options (swimming, jumping, strength) are traits *shared* by both leopards and lions according to the passage.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiyani chomwe Robert Hooke anapanga akatswiri a sayansi ena asanapange?","The correct answer is **A: Onetsetsani maselo akufa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Adali munthu woyamba kuwona ma cello wokufa."" (He was the first person to see dead cells.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gwiritsani ntchito mayikulosikopu kuti muwone tizilombo:** The passage says he used a microscope, but doesn't say he was the first to do so to see organisms.
*   **C: Onetsetsani masikweya ang’ono ang’ono:** While he saw structures that *looked* like rooms or boxes, the passage doesn't say he discovered those shapes specifically.
*   **D: Pezani chinthu chamoyo malingana ndi magwiridwe ake ntchito:** This is a broader concept related to cell function, but the passage focuses on his specific observation of dead cells.



"
Kodi mawu okuti “selo” anachokera kuti?,"The correct answer is **B: Chipinda chaching’ono**.

The passage states: ""Cell lidachokera ku mawu achilatini otchedwa cella omwe amatanthauza kuti kachipinda kakang'ono."" This directly translates to ""Cell originated from the Latin word 'cella' which means a small room/chamber.""



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, nyama zambiri zimakhala ndikuthekera kotani?","The correct answer is **B: Kuyenda (Walking)**.

The passage states: ""nyama zambiri zimayenda"" which translates to ""many animals walk."" 

While the passage mentions animals can dig, swim, and fly, it specifically highlights *walking* as a common ability of *many* animals.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi nyama zina sizikhala ndi chiyani?","The correct answer is **C: Ubongo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndinyama zokha zomwe zimakhala ndi ubongo (ngakhale sinyama zonse zili nawo; mwachitsanzo jellyfish zilibe ubongo)."" This directly says that *not all* animals have brains, using jellyfish as an example.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maselo (Cells)** - The passage says animals *are made of* many cells.
*   **B: Kuthekera kugaya zakudya m’mimba (Ability to digest food)** - The passage states animals ""eat things and digest them inside.""
*   **D: Kuthekera pakudya (Ability to eat)** - The passage clearly states animals ""eat things"".



"
Kodi ndichiyani chomwe chimathandiza mbewu popanga fotosensinsi?,"The correct answer is **D: Dzuwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zomera zimapanga zakudya zawo kuchokera kudzuwa pogwiritsa njira yotchedwa photosynthesis."" (Plants make their food from the sun using a process called photosynthesis.)  Photosynthesis *requires* sunlight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mthunzi (Shade)** - Shade is the *absence* of sunlight, and would hinder photosynthesis.
*   **B: Nyama (Animals)** - Animals eat plants, they don't help plants make food.
*   **C: Chakudya (Food)** - Plants *make* food, they don't need food to start the process.



"
Kodi ndi chiyani chomwe anthu amatulutsa popuma chomwe mbewu zimapupa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kabonidayeukusayidi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Zomera zimatenga mpweya oyipa umene anthu amatulutsa (ndiye kuti, kutulutsa)."" and ""anthu amatulutsa (kutulutsa)"" refers to carbon dioxide.
* **Photosynthesis:** Plants use carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to create food and release oxygen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chakudya (Food):** Humans *consume* food, they don't exhale it.
* **B: Okusijini (Oxygen):** Humans breathe *in* oxygen, they don't exhale it.
* **C: Madzi (Water):** While we exhale some water vapor, carbon dioxide is the primary gas plants absorb from us.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chitsanzo chiti chimene chingalepheletse kusintha makhalidwe a zinthu zamoyo?","The correct answer is **A: Ka gulu kakang’ono kulephera kutakasuka m’malo a chilendo**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that speciation (the creation of new species) happens when a small group becomes isolated and faces different environmental pressures, *forcing* them to adapt. If a small group *fails* to establish itself in a new location (doesn't ""take root""), it won't experience those pressures and won't begin to diverge from the original population. This prevents the speciation process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kagulu ka mugulu la anthu kupita ku malo achilendo:** This *starts* the process of speciation, as described in the passage.
*   **C: Gulu la anthu Kusintha machitidwe ake mkati mwa malo achilendo:** This is a *result* of speciation; it's the adaptation happening.
*   **D: Gulu limodzi la anthu kenako kupanga magulu awiri:** While this can lead to speciation, the passage emphasizes the *isolation* and new environmental pressures as the critical factors. Simply dividing doesn't guarantee different evolutionary paths.



"
Ndichiyani mwandemanga izi zimene sizikunena bwino za ndondomeko ya kapangidwe ka zinthu zamoyo zatsopano? ,"The correct answer is **A: Zimachitika pamene gulu la anthu likulephere Kusintha (It happens when a group of people fails to Adapt)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that when a small group becomes isolated, it needs to *adapt* to a new environment with different pressures.**  The passage highlights the *need* for change (new adaptations) as a driving force behind speciation.  If a group *failed* to adapt, it wouldn't diverge and form a new species – it would likely perish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndi zinthu zofunikira pa nkhani ya Kusintha makhalidwe ka zinthu zamoyo kapena magulu a anthu (It is essential to the matter of changing the characteristics of living things or groups of people)** - The passage *supports* this. Speciation *is* a key mechanism of evolution (changing characteristics).
* **C: Zimatanthauza kuti kupanga zinthu zamoyo zatsopano zoti zimachulukana (It means creating new living things to multiply)** - While speciation results in new species that can multiply, the passage doesn't focus on the multiplication itself, but the *process* of becoming new species.
* **D: Kuchitika kwake ndikosakaikira (Its occurrence is doubtful)** - The passage portrays speciation as an ""inevitable consequence"" and ""essential"" part of evolution. It's presented as a well-established process, not something doubtful.



"
Ndimbali iti ya muthupi imene imabweretsa magazi kupita ku mtima?,"The correct answer is **D: Machubu otenga magazi kupita ku mtima**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Magazi amabwelera kupita ku mtima podzera mtimathyubu totchedwa ma veins."" (Blood returns to the heart through tubes called veins).
* **Option D** directly reflects this information – veins are the tubes that *take* blood *to* the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Machubu otenga magazi kupita komanso kuchokera magawo a thupi** - This is too broad. It describes both arteries and veins, not specifically what brings blood *to* the heart.
* **B: Machubu ang’onoang’ono amuthupi** - This refers to capillaries, which are involved in exchange, not returning blood to the heart.
* **C: Mbali imodzi ya thupi imene imagwira ntchito** - This is vague and doesn’t relate to the passage's description of blood vessels.



"
Machubu ati amene ali ochepetsetsa mu kayendetsedwe ka magazi mthupi?,"The correct answer is **A: Machubu ang’onoang’ono amuthupi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Timathyubu tochepa kwambiri timatchedwa ma capillaries."" (The very small tubes are called capillaries.)
* **Capillaries** are the smallest blood vessels in the body and are crucial for the exchange of oxygen and nutrients.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This describes both arteries and veins.
* **C:** This describes veins.
* **D:** This is not related to blood vessels.



"
Kodi kuthekera kwa kachilombo kupinda mapiko awo kumbuyo zimawonjezera chiyani mwaizi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kubisa malo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Zimenezi zima apatsa malo ambiri ang'onoang'ono woti zizibisalamo powopa adani womwe angawaphe."" (This gives them many small places to hide when they are afraid of an enemy who might kill them.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kukhala ndichakudya** - The passage mentions finding food *and* mates with flight, not specifically with the ability to fold wings.
*   **C: Kupeza abanja awo** - The passage does not mention finding family.
*   **D: Kuthamanga powuluka** - While flight is mentioned, the passage connects wing folding to *hiding*, not faster flight.



"
Kodi ndichiyani mwaizi chomwe sichinatchulidwe mu ndimeyi ngati chinachake chomwe chimakhuza kuthekera kowulika kwaka chilombo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kupanga ana (Reproduction)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on survival traits that directly aid in flight and avoiding predators:** It mentions wings for escape and finding food, and the ability to tuck wings into their bodies for protection.
*   **Cusaka zakudya (Hunting/Finding food)** is mentioned explicitly as a benefit of flight.
*   **Moyenerera (Fitness)** is implied – the traits discussed contribute to a creature's ability to survive and therefore its fitness.
*   **Nthawi yokhala ndi moyo (Lifespan)** isn't discussed in relation to flight or the mentioned insects.
*   **Kupanga ana (Reproduction)** is *not* mentioned anywhere in the passage. While important for a species' survival, it doesn't directly relate to the ability to fly or the specific adaptations discussed.

Therefore, reproduction is the only option not connected to the information presented in the text."

Kodi ndichiti mwaizi chomwe sichipezeka pakati pa mbalame ndi madinosowa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutha kuwuluka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many people didn't think birds could be dinosaurs *because* they can fly. It highlights that this difference (ability to fly) led people to initially dismiss the connection. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuyikila mazira (Laying eggs):** The passage says birds *do* lay eggs, just like dinosaurs.
*   **B: Kugwiritsa ntchito miyendo iwiri yakumbuyo poyenda (Using two hind legs to walk):** The passage says birds walk on two legs like the T-Rex.
*   **D: Mapazi azikhadabo (Scaly legs):** The passage states birds have scaly legs, similar to dinosaurs.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi mbali iti ya mbewu ya sayikadi yomwe nyama zamtundu wama Triceratop zingakonde kudya?","The correct answer is **A: Masamba a sipayiki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zomelazi zikuoneka ngati kamtengo ka kanjedza kakang'ono kamene kali ndi korona wa **masamba akuthwa**, onunkhira."" (Cycads look like a small palm tree that has a crown of **sharp leaves**, fragrant.)

The passage specifically mentions the *leaves* of the cycad as being the part the Triceratops would have eaten. The other options (thunthu, muzu, chipatso) are not mentioned as being part of the Triceratops diet in this context.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiyani mwaizi chomwe nyama zamtundu wama Triceratop zingakonde kudya? ","The correct answer is **B: Mbewu zomwe zili ndi nthambi zolimba** (Seeds with tough branches).

Here's why:

The passage states that Triceratops ""ate not only leaves but also tough branches, including roots."" While the passage *discusses* cycads and whether they might be poisonous, it explicitly says Triceratops ate branches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kanyama kotchedwa silosi** (An animal called a sloth) - The passage mentions sloths *as an example* of animals that eat poisonous plants, but doesn't say Triceratops ate them.
*   **C: Paroti** (Parrot) - Parrots are also mentioned as an example, not as Triceratops food.
*   **D: Mbewu zomwe zili ndi zipatso zakupha** (Seeds with poisonous fruits) - The passage discusses whether cycads were poisonous, but doesn't say Triceratops specifically preferred these.

"Kutengera ndi zomwe mwapatsidwa pa ndimeyi, ndi ati mwamasewerowa amene anapambana ukaswiri wa dziko lonse ku Italy?","Correct answer: **A: Mpira wamiyendo**

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the Italian football (soccer) team is ""the second best team in the world"" and were ""masters of the 2006 FIFA World Cup"". This directly indicates that football (mpira wamiyendo) is the sport where Italy has achieved world mastery."
Patatha zochitika ziti pamene mbali zina za Luxembourg zinakhala Belgian?,"Yowonetsa yoyenera ndi **B: Zosintha mu Belgium**. 

Zolemba zikuwonetsa momveka kuti gawo la Luxembourg linakhala Belgian ""patatha zaka za m'ma 1830 chifukwa cha Belgian Revolution."" Revolution ya ku Belgium, yomwe idachitika m'zaka za m'ma 1830, idayambitsa kusinthidwa kwa malire ndipo idatsogolera ku gawo la Luxembourg kukhala mbali ya Belgium."

Kodi pali ma sikweya kilomitazi angati a dziko la Turkey lonse mu gawo lonse laku Ulaya?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The text states: ""masikweya makilomita 23,764 (9,174 sq mi) ali ku Ulaya.""  This directly answers the question about the area of Turkey in Europe.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mtunda wa mayilosi ochuluka bwanji kupita ku dziko la Turkey?","The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Dera la Turkey ndilokula ndi makilomita 1600 mulitali (mamayilosi 1,000) ndipo makilomita 800 mulifupi (mamayilosi 500)..."" 

This translates to: ""The area of Turkey is 1600 kilometers long (1,000 miles) and 800 kilometers wide (500 miles)...""

Therefore, the longest distance in miles given is 1,000."
Chilankhulo chachi Latin chimagwiritsidwa ntchito yanji mu nzinda wa Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Mikumano yachipembedzo**.

The passage states: ""Chilatini nthawi zambiri chimagwiritsidwa ntchito m'mikumano ya chipembedzo."" (Latin is often used in religious gatherings).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mauthenga atsiku ndi tsiku** - The passage states Italian is used for daily communication.
* **C: Malamulo** - The passage states Italian is used for laws.
* **D: Uthenga oyenelera** -  The passage doesn't mention Latin being used for official correspondence.



"
"Mu nzinda wa Vatican, chi Italiyani chimagwiritsidwa ntchito yanji?","The correct answer is **D: Mauthenga atsiku ndi tsiku**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chitaliyana ndichilankhuloso chomwe chimagwiritsidwa ntchito tsiku ndi tsiku ndi anthu ambiri omwe amagwira ntchito m'boma..."" (Italian is the language used daily by many people who work in government). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Malamulo** - While Italian is *used* in laws, the text doesn't say it's the primary way it's used.
*   **B: Uthenga oyenelera** - The text doesn't mention official communications specifically.
*   **C: Mikumano yachipembedzo** - Latin is primarily used for religious ceremonies.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ubwino wanji ochokera pakuphatikiza mawu pa makomputa otsogola kwambiri?","The correct answer is **B: Zinthu zosangalatsa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nthawi zambiri nyimbozi zimajambulidwa pogwiritsa ntchito makompuyuta amakono kwambiri kuti anthe kuphatikiza mawu pamodzi."" This means advanced computers are used to *add words* (i.e., dialogue) to music. The passage then implies this leads to more visually engaging content.  While ""zojambula"" (art) and ""zomangamanga"" (structures) are related to visual media, the passage specifically connects advanced computing to the addition of dialogue, ultimately enhancing the entertainment value (""zinthu zosangalatsa"") of movies and videos.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyimbo (Songs):** The passage doesn't focus on the benefit *to the songs themselves*, but rather to the overall media product.
*   **C: Zojambula (Art):** While visual effects *are* art, the passage is specifically about adding dialogue.
*   **D: Zomangamanga (Structures):** This doesn't relate to the content of the passage."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,manyumba ambiri mudera liti amene anali ndi zimbudzi zamadzi zamakono?","The correct answer is **A: Mahenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Matauni a Harappa ndi Mohenjo-daro ali ndizimbudzi wofulasha pafupifupi nyumba iliyonse ndimopita zimbudzi zapamwamba zedi."" (The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house and also had sophisticated drainage systems.)

The other options are mentioned as having plumbing in general, but not to the extent of being in *almost every* house. Therefore, Mahenjo-daro is the most accurate answer."
Ndi mbali iti mwambalizi kumene kuli malo otayilako chimbudzi?,"The correct answer is **B: Santorini**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Zotsalira za mnjira yodzera chimbudzi zapezeka mnyumba yakumizinda ya Minoan ku Crete komanso ku Santorini mdziko la Greece."" (Remains of a drainage system have been found in a Minoan urban house in Crete and Santorini in Greece.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Harappa:** The passage states Harappa *had* drains near every house, but doesn't say they were specifically *toilet* drains.
*   **C: Eguputo:** The passage mentions toilets existed in ancient Egypt, but doesn't say where they were located or if drains were found with them.
*   **D: Dziko la China:**  The passage mentions toilets in ancient China, but doesn't say where they were located or if drains were found with them.



"
Ndichiyani mwa izi zimapangitsa kuti okwera ngati ngalawa pa ayisi azizungulira?,"The correct answer is **A: Pali popindika kakang’ono pansi pangati ngalawa pa yoyenda pa ayisi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that the curved bottom (the ""bowo wopindikira"") and the edges are key to how the board works.** The curve allows the board to grip the snow, and the edges create a carving effect. When the rider leans, the board edges dig into the snow on the leaning side, causing it to turn. The passage specifically mentions that leaning right makes you carve right, and leaning left makes you carve left. This carving is a result of the curved bottom and edges interacting with the snow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Malo akuthwa awiri m’bali mwa ngati ngalawa yoyenda pa ayisi** - While the edges *help* with grip, they aren't the primary reason for turning. The curve is more important.
* **C: Ukadaulo wa okwera ngati ngalawa pa ayisi** - Skill is important for *executing* turns, but doesn’t explain *how* the board itself allows turning.
* **D: Ayisi owoneka bwino** - The quality of the snow affects the ride, but it doesn’t explain the board’s mechanism for turning.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndi chiyani mwa izi zikulongosola bwino zabowo lapa ngati ngalawa pa ayisi yamakono?","The correct answer is **B: Mopindika**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states the chipalawe (skateboard for sand) has a ""bowo wopindikira mkati pakati pawo"" (a curved bow inside between them). This curve is a key feature of how it works, allowing it to grip the sand and cause the rider to lean into turns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chakuthwa konsekonse** (completely sharp) - While the sides are described as ""zakuthwa"" (sharp), the passage emphasizes the *curve* more than the sharpness itself.
*   **C: Chinthu cholowa mkati** (something that goes inside) - This doesn't describe the function or shape of the bow.
*   **D: Mopendama** (leaning/tilting) - This is a *result* of the bow, not a description of the bow itself.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi njira iti imene ma atomu amaloledwa kuchotsa mphamvu yamagetsi yopitilira muyeso ku magetsi?","The correct answer is **B: Kutuluka kwama fotoni** (Emission of photons).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that atoms remove excess energy by *emitting* tiny particles called ""Photons."" It then defines the process as ""stimulated emission of radiation,"" meaning the atoms release photons when stimulated by light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mphamvu yochokera malo okhazikika yoyenda m’mulengalenga pasipidi ya magetsi** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Fotoni** - While photons *are* involved, the question asks about the *process* of removing energy, not what the particles themselves are.
*   **D: Zopangitsa kutuluka mphamvu ya magetsi yochokera malo okhazikika yoyenda m’mulengalenga pakuthamanga ngati kuwala** - This is a more complex description and not the direct answer to how atoms rid themselves of excess energy as stated in the text.



"
Chimapangitsa maatomu kutulutsa fotoni ndi chiyani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutulutsa mphamvu zopitilira muyezo za magetsi** (Releasing excess energy from electrons).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""akuyenera kuchotsa mphamvu yowonjezera yomwe anayipeza kuchokera ku kuwala"" (they need to release excess energy they gained from light). This excess energy is released as photons.  Electrons gaining energy from light is what causes the ""excess"" energy.
* **Stimulated Emission:** The passage describes *stimulated emission* - atoms are excited by light and then *release* photons to return to their original state. This release *is* the release of excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zopangitsa babu kuyaka kwambiri** (Making bulbs burn brighter): This is unrelated to the scientific process described.
* **C: Mphamvu ya magetsi yosakhazikika** (Unstable electrical energy): While electrons are involved, the passage focuses on *releasing* excess energy, not just having instability.
* **D: Zotsalira zoyipa za kayendedwe ka mphamvu ya magetsi yochokera malo okhazikika yoyenda m’mulengalenga** (Bad remnants of electrical energy movement from a stable place moving in the air): This is a very convoluted and inaccurate description of the process.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, chingapangitse babu la magetsi kusiya kuyaka ndi chiyani?","The correct answer is **C: Kuwonongeka kwa mawaya a mkati mwa babu (Damage to the wires inside the bulb)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ikagwira ntchito maola mazana, filamenti mubabulo imapsa ndipo babu siliyakaso."" This directly translates to ""After working for hundreds of hours, the filament in the bulb breaks and the bulb no longer lights up.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kusazimitsidwa moyenera mbali imodzi ya magetsi (Improper grounding of one side of the electricity):** The passage doesn't mention grounding as a cause for the bulb failing.
*   **B: Kukhala ndi chitsulo cha babu la magetsi kukhudza pang’ono mu soketi (Having the metal part of the electrical bulb slightly touch the socket):** The passage warns about the *danger* of this, but doesn't state it *causes* the bulb to burn out.
*   **D: Kayendedwe ka mphamvu ya magetsi kupita ku soketi kakuchepa (The flow of electrical power to the socket decreases):**  The passage doesn't suggest a reduction in power is the issue.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi zikhoza kukhala zoopsya kuzigwira pamene tikusintha getsi loyaka?,"The correct answer is **C: Pansi pa babu** (the bottom of the bulb).

Here's why:

The passage specifically warns that touching the metal base of the bulb while it's still connected to the socket (even with the bulb off) can give you a strong electric shock.  The passage states: ""...lingakupangitseni kumva nyesi yamphamvu yochuluka pamene mwagwira mkati mwa socket kapena **chitsulo chapansi pa babu** pamene babulo linali mu socket.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waya wamugetsi** (Electric wire) - While electric wires are dangerous, the passage doesn't specifically highlight them as a hazard *during bulb replacement*.
*   **B: Poyatsira magetsi** (Switch) - The passage emphasizes *turning off* the switch *before* starting, not the switch itself being dangerous to touch.
*   **D: Waya (nthambo)** (Wire) - This is too general. The passage refers to specific wires within the socket.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, chimachitika ndi chiyani pamene nucleus yaphulika?","The correct answer is **B: Mphamvu zimatulutsidwa** (Energy is released).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kugawa ma nucleus kachikenaso kenako ndikutulutsa mphamvu zina."" which translates to ""...splitting the nucleus again and then releasing more energy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mapulotonu amapezeka** (Protons are found) - While protons *are* part of the nucleus, the passage doesn't specifically say they are *released* when it splits.
*   **C: Ma atomu amakhala osakhazikika** (Atoms become unstable) - The passage says some atoms *already* have unstable nuclei, but doesn't say instability is a result of fission.
*   **D: Manyutulonzi amasowa** (Neutrons are lost) -  While neutrons are involved, the key point about fission in the text is the release of energy.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi chimene chikuonetsa mauthenga la lamya ochokera patali to kupita ku dziko,"The correct answer is **B: Masetilayiti** (Satellites).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Setilayiti yomwe ili mumlengalenga imalandira foni ndikuibwezela pansi, nthawi yomweyo.""  This directly describes how satellites facilitate long-distance communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matelesikopu (Telescopes):** Telescopes are for *observing* things in space, not transmitting phone calls.
* **C: Magetsi (Electricity):** Electricity is a power source, not the method of sending messages over long distances.
* **D: Maroketi (Rockets):** Rockets *launch* satellites and telescopes, but they don't transmit messages themselves.



"
Nda chiyani mwa izi zimene zimapangitsa kuyika telesikopu m’mlengalenga?,"The correct answer is **B: Maroketi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zimafunika rocket yayikulu kwambiri yopitilira mafiti 100 kutalika kokwera m'mwamba kuti ikasiye satellite kapena telesikopi mumlengalenga."" This directly links rockets to the process of getting telescopes into space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuwala kochokera malo ake** - While telescopes *use* light, the passage doesn't say light is what *puts* them in space.
*   **C: Maonekedwe a dziko** - The passage mentions Earth's atmosphere interfering with observations, but doesn't say it's involved in launching telescopes.
*   **D: Masetilayiti omwe ali kutali kuposa mapazi 100** - Satellites are used for communication, not for launching telescopes. The passage states rockets are needed to get satellites (and telescopes) into space.



"
Tingaone chiyani chokhudza zinthu zochitika motsagana kuti tilondoloze nthawi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kubwereza** (Repetition).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muntha kuwona m'mene nthawi yapitira panokha poyang'ana kabwerezedwe ka chinthu chochitika mozungulira. Chinthu chochitika mozungulira ndi chinthu chomwe chimachitikachitika mobwerezabwereza."" 

This directly translates to: ""You can see how time has passed by looking at the repetition of an event. A cyclical event is something that happens repeatedly.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kutalika kwa nthawi** (Length of time) - While the passage mentions time having length, it doesn't say we observe time *through* its length.
* **C: Kukhudza** (Touching) - The passage says time *affects* everything, but doesn't suggest we measure it by touching things.
* **D: Kuvuta** (Difficulty) - The passage acknowledges time is difficult to understand, but doesn't propose it's how we observe its passage.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiyani cha zochitika chimene nthawi ikugwiritsidwa pofanizira?","The correct answer is **A: Kutalika**.

The passage states: ""Nthawi ndi momwenso timafanizira matalikidwe (kutalika) a zochitika."" This directly translates to ""Time is also how we measure the length of events."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kubwereza (Repetition):** While the passage mentions cyclical events, time isn't *used to measure* repetition, it's observed *in* repetition.
* **C: Kudziwa zinthu (Knowing things):** The passage doesn't state time is used to measure understanding.
* **D: Kukhudza (Touching):** The passage talks about time affecting everything, but doesn't say it's used to measure touch.

*   **C:** Kuphunzira zakale sikuloza kuti alowa m’malo mwa mfumu."
"Kutengera ndi zomwe mwapatsidwa pa ndimeyi, Charles anali oyamba kupanga chiyani?","The correct answer is **C: Kupeza digiri** (To get a degree).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Charles anali membala oyamba wa Banja la chifumu ku Britain kuti apatsidwe digiri."" which translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kulowa usilikali asanamalize sukulu** (Joining the military before finishing school) - The passage says traditionally heirs *didn't* finish school before joining the military, but doesn't say Charles was the first to do this.
*   **B: Kumphunzira zakale za munthu** (Studying anthropology) - He studied anthropology, but wasn't the first royal to *study* something.
*   **D: Pitani ku koleji ya Trinity** (Going to Trinity College) - He went to Trinity, but wasn't the first royal to attend a university.



"
Ndi dziko liti limene katundu wa Trygvasson’s amachokera?,"The correct answer is **D: Noroweyi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Pachiyambi linatsogozedwa ndi a Olaf Trygvasson, aku Norway..."" (It was led by Olaf Trygvasson, from Norway...). Therefore, Trygvasson is from Norway."
Kodi ndi nthawi yanji pa mbiri yomwe dziko la Jeremani lidayika nyonga zake zachichalidwe kudziko la Esitoniya?,"The correct answer is **B: Pakati pazaka 400 zapitazo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Estonian language *developed* based on German influence. It doesn't specify an exact timeframe, but mentions it happened ""Nthawi itadutsa"" (time passed) after the initial introduction of the language based on German script. Considering the passage speaks of a historical process of influence and adoption over time, 400 years is the most reasonable estimate given the options.  The other options (200, 600, and 800 years) are either too short or too long to accurately represent the described gradual linguistic development."

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi nambala ya nzika zolankhula chi Hindi ikutsika chifukwa chiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Ngati dailets yofanana ndi Hindi zikuwelengedwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chiwerengero cha mbadwa zomwe zimalankhula chilankhulo chobadwa nacho chimasintha kamba kakuti zilankhulo zapafupi zomwe ndizofananira zimawerengedwa nawo kapena ayi."" This directly means the number changes depending on whether closely related dialects are *included* in the count.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While Hindi and Urdu are similar, the passage doesn't say the count is decreasing *because* Urdu speakers are included. It says the count *changes* based on whether similar languages are included.
*   **C:** The passage mentions 800 million can *understand* Hindi, but that doesn't affect the count of native *speakers*.
*   **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the ability to *read* Hindi affecting the speaker count.



"
Kodi mwa izi ndi ndemanga iti yabwino yokhudza zilankhulo za Hindi ndi Urdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Zimasiyana mu kalembedwe** (They differ in writing).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Zilankhulo za Chihindi ndi Urdu ndi zofanana m'mawu koma zimasiyana ndi zilembo"" which translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are similar in words but differ in script.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nthawi zina pamakhala kusiyana pakati pa oyankhula zilankhulo ziwirizi** (Sometimes there are differences between speakers of the two languages) - While true in general for *any* two languages, the passage doesn’t emphasize this as a key difference.
* **C: Zimafanana mu chilankhulo komanso mukalembedwe** (They are similar in language and writing) - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: Zimasiyana mu mawu ogwiritsira mu chilankhulo** (They differ in words used in language) - The passage says they are *similar* in words.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi zimene sicholondola pankhani ya Hangeul alphabet?,"The correct answer is **A: Zinapangidwa kumayambiliro kwa ulamuliro wa Mfumu Sejong’s**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hangeul was created in **1444**, which was *during* Sejong's reign (1418-1450), but not at the *beginning* of it. It was towards the end of his rule.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: Dzina lenileni la alphabet linali Hunan Jeongeum** - The passage explicitly states the original name was Hunmin Jeongeum.
*   **C: Zinapangidwa ndi ulamuliro wa Dynasty wa chinayi wa Joseon** - The passage confirms Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty when Hangeul was created.
*   **D: Zidapangidwa ndi cholinga** - The passage indicates the purpose of Hangeul was to “accurately instruct the people”.



"
Kodi zilembo za afabeti za Hunmin Jeongeum mapeto ake zidasinthidwa kukhala chiyani?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The passage states: ""Initially, he named the letters of Hangeul to be Hunmin Jeongeum..."" and then later refers to them simply as Hangeul. Therefore, Hunmin Jeongeum was the original name, which eventually became Hangeul.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi zilankhulo ziti zomwe zidatenga mangolomera kuchokera ku Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **D: Zilankhulo zaku India**.

The passage states: ""Sanskrit ndi chiyambi cha zilankhulo zambiri zamakono zaku India, ngati m'mene ilili Latin ndi gwero la zilankhulo zaku Ulaya monga ngati France ndi Spain."" This directly indicates that modern Indian languages originated from Sanskrit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zilankhulo za Chilatini:** The passage compares Sanskrit *to* Latin, but doesn't say Indian languages come from Latin.
*   **B: Zilankhulo zaku Ulaya:**  The passage states European languages come from Latin, not Sanskrit.
*   **C: Zilankhulo zakalekale:** This is too broad. While Sanskrit is ancient, the passage specifically mentions its influence on *modern* Indian languages.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi kugwiritsa ntchito Sanskrit kudachepa chifukwa chiyani?","The correct answer is **D: Milingo ya ulamuliro** (Political power).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pambuyo posonkhanista chilankhulo cha Upanishads, chi Sanskrit chidatha chifukwa cha kuchepa mphanvu."" This directly translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit declined because of a decrease in power.""  ""Mphanvu"" refers to political power or influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: zovuta** (difficulty) - While the passage states Sanskrit is complex, it doesn't say this *caused* its decline.
*   **B: Anthu wosakanikirana aku India ndiku Irani anakhazikika kalekale ku Irani** (The mixed people of India and Iran settled anciently in Iran) - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.
*   **C: Zilankhulo za Chilatini** (Latin languages) - The passage *compares* Sanskrit to Latin, but doesn't say Latin languages caused its decline.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndichiyani mwaizi ili ndemanga yolondola pankhani yamphamvu ya lo?","The correct answer is **A: Mphamvu ya dziko ikhoza kukoka mochepa pa inu kusiyana ndi mphamvu ya lo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that you weigh less on the moon because the force of gravity pulls on you *less* than on Earth. This means the moon's gravitational force is weaker. Option A directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** The passage says the moon's gravity pulls *less*, causing you to weigh less, not more.
*   **C:**  Again, the passage states you weigh *less* on the moon, not more.
*   **D:** The passage states Earth's gravity pulls *more* than the moon's, making you weigh more on Earth. This is the opposite of what option D says.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiyani mwa izi chimene chikufotokoza bwino zakawonekedwe kakunja kwa mwezi?","The correct answer is **B: Chakunja cholimba ndi chochepelako pansi pa mapiri**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ndiyopyapyala pansi pa maria ndipo yokhutala kumapiri."" (It is thin under the maria and thick under the mountains.) This directly supports the idea that the crust is thicker beneath the mountains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbali yapafupi ili ndi chakunja cholimba** - The passage doesn't say the near side has a *thick* crust, just that it's about 70km thick.  It also says the far side is thicker.
* **C: Pakhoza kukhala a maliya ochepa pambali yakutali** - The passage states the opposite - more maria on the near side.
* **D: Pakhoza kukhala a maliya ochepa pansi pa mapiri** - The passage links the thinner crust with *maria*, not mountains.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi chakunja cholimba kwambiri cha mwezi chimapezeka pati?","The correct answer is **C: Pansi pa mapiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndiyopyapyala pansi pa maria ndipo **yokhutala kumapiri**."" This translates to ""It is thin under the maria and **thick under the mountains**."" Therefore, the crust is thickest under the mountains.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndichiyani mwaizi chomwe anthu ena amakhulupilira?","The correct answer is **C: Kulibe moyo kuma pulaneti ena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ena amakhulupilira kuti kuli alendo kapena moyo muzomera kuma planet ena."" This directly translates to ""some believe there are aliens or life in plants on other planets.""  Therefore, the passage mentions people *believing* in life on other planets, which is the opposite of saying there is *no* life. However, option C states ""Kulibe moyo kuma pulaneti ena"" which is exactly the belief mentioned in the passage as something people doubt or don't believe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anthu adafikako ku nyenyezi zina** - The passage says people *dream* of going to other stars, but doesn't state they've already been there.
*   **B: Anthu alibe kuthekera kopeza mayiko ena** - The passage doesn't say it's *impossible* to reach other worlds, only that it's difficult and will take time.
*   **D: Pali mtunda wochepera mamayilosi mathililioni pakati pa nyenyezi** - The passage states stars are *very far away*, the opposite of being a small distance apart.



"
Kodi ndichiyani chomwe chimayamba kuchepa phapha pamene mukuchoka kwambiri kuchokera pakati pa Dzuwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasi**.

The passage states: ""Mpweyawo umayamba kuchepa ndithu pamene mukupita patali kuchokera pakatikati pa Dzuwalo.""  This directly translates to ""The gas starts to decrease as you move further away from the center of the Sun.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pulasima (Plasma):** While the sun *contains* plasma, the text doesn't say plasma decreases as you move outwards.
* **B: Moto (Fire):**  The passage mentions fire as a component of the sun, but doesn't say it decreases.
* **D: Chakunja cholimba (Solid exterior):** The sun is not solid; it's made of gases, fire, and plasma.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mbali iti ya dzuwa imene imaoneka kuchokera ku dziko?","The correct answer is **C: Gawo lowara la nyenyezi kapena dzuwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that what we see on the outside of the Sun is called the **Photosphere**, and defines it as meaning ""mpira wowala"" (a bright sphere). This directly corresponds to the outer layer of the sun that is visible from Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chakunja cholimba** - The passage doesn't mention a solid exterior.
*   **B: Pulasima** - While plasma *is* a component of the Sun, the photosphere is the *visible* layer.
*   **D: Pakati** - We cannot see the center of the Sun.



"
Kodi ndi chiyani mwa izi chidathandizira kutsimikizira ganizo la Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Zigawo za Venasi** (The phases of Venus).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Zigawo za Venus zidathandiza maganizo a Copernicus akuti ma pulaneti amazungulira Dzuwa."" (The phases of Venus supported Copernicus's idea that planets revolve around the Sun.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ulendo waku Venasi** (The transit of Venus) - While Horrocks observed the transit of Venus, the passage states it happened *after* the phases of Venus had already supported Copernicus's theory.
* **C: Dzuwa ndilofanana ndi Venasi** (The Sun is like Venus) - The passage doesn't mention any similarities between the Sun and Venus.
* **D: Dzuwa ndilofanana ndi Mwezi** (The Sun is like the Moon) - The passage uses the Moon as a comparison for *phases* but doesn't state they are similar otherwise.



"
Kodi ndi chiyani mwaizi chomwe Galileo Galilei adawona mchaka cha 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Zigawo za Venasi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pafupifupi zaka zikwi zitatu zitadutsa, muchaka cha 1610, katswiri waku Italy wowona zakuthambo, a Galileo Galilei adagwiritsa ntchito makina a telescope kuti awone ngati Venus ali ndi magawo ngati m'mene mwezi ulili."" This translates to: ""Around three hundred years ago, in 1610, an Italian astronomer, Galileo Galilei, used a telescope to see if Venus had phases like the moon."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mbali ya mwezi yomwe ikuyang’anana ndi Dzuwa** (The side of the moon facing the sun) - While the text *compares* Venus's phases to the moon, Galileo was observing Venus, not the moon.
* **C: Pulaneti yomwe ikuyenda mozungulira dzuwa** (A planet orbiting the sun) - Galileo's observations *supported* the idea of planets orbiting the sun, but he didn't directly *see* a planet orbiting the sun.
* **D: Ulendo waku Venasi** (Venus's transit) - Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus in 1639, not Galileo in 1610.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi mtsinje wa Amazoni wumatenga madzi kuchokera kuti?","The correct answer is **A: Mitsinje ing’onoing’ono**.

The passage states: ""Umatenga madzi kuchokera ku mitsinje ing'onoing'ono zikwizikwi."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mtsinje wautali kwambiri** - The passage doesn't say it gets water *from* the longest river, only that it *is* a very long river.
*   **C: Nyanja za mchere** - The passage says water *flows into* the ocean from the Amazon, not the other way around.
*   **D: Mtsinje wachiwiri kukula kwambiri** - The passage states the Amazon is the second largest, but doesn't say it gets water from it.



"
Kodi ndi ulemu uti womwe mtsinje wa Amazoni sudalandire?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndi mtsinje wautali kwambiri**.

Here's why:

The text states the Amazon is the *second* longest river in the world (""Mtsinje wa Amazon ndi mtsinje wachiwiri kutalika..."").  Therefore, it doesn't hold the value of being the *longest* river.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndi mtsinje wachiwiri kutalika kwambiri** - The text *confirms* this is a characteristic of the Amazon.
*   **B: Ndi mtsinje waukulu kwambiri** - The text states it carries a huge amount of water and a large percentage of the world's river water, implying it's very large.
*   **D: Ndi mtsinje wotambalala kwambiri** - The text explicitly says it's the widest river in the world (""Mtsinje wa Amazon wotambalala kwambiri pa dziko lonse lapansi"").



"
Kodi ndi ntchito iti yomwe yatchulidwa m’ndimeyi yomwe imalemba anthu ochepa aku Venezuyela?,"Correct answer: **C: Mafuta**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...only one part works in oil companies"". This clearly identifies oil companies as employing the smallest portion of the Venezuelan workforce among the industries mentioned. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ulimi** - Agriculture isn't mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Mafakitale** - The passage mentions the economic sector, but not manufacturing.
*   **D: Ntchito** - ""Ntchito"" is too broad. The passage discusses *types* of employment, not employment overall."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi magawo ati mwa awa omwe amalemba ntchito anthu aku Venezuyela ambiri?","The correct answer is **A: Ntchito**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""two out of three Venezuelans who work are employed in the services sector."" This indicates the largest portion of employed Venezuelans work in services. While oil is a major export, only ""about one in ten workers is employed in oil companies.""  The passage doesn't mention anything about agriculture or manufacturing as significant employers.

Therefore, ""Ntchito"" (Services) is the sector employing the most Venezuelans according to the text."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi kuphatikizana kumalola nyenyezi kutani?","The correct answer is **C: Kupereka kuwala komanso kutentha**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nyenyezi zimapereka kuwala komanso kutentha kamba ka mphamvu yomwe yimapangidwa pamene ma atom a mpweya wa hydrogen akaphatikizana..."" (Stars emit light and heat as a result of the energy that is produced when atoms of hydrogen gas combine...)

This directly links fusion to the production of light and heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupanga zinthu zolemera** - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the passage says this happens *as a result* of the energy production, not that this is the primary function that allows stars to function.
*   **B: Kupanga maliyakitazi wophatikizana** - The passage doesn't mention creating a unified catalyst.
*   **D: Kupanga ma atomu a hayidilojini** - Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, but doesn't create them. It combines them.



"
Kodi ndichiyani mwaizi maliyakita ofunikira pophatikizana angapange?,"The correct answer is **A: Hayidilojini** (Hydrogen).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...when atoms of hydrogen gas fuse together..."" This directly identifies hydrogen as the fuel source for the fusion process.
* **Fusion relies on hydrogen isotopes:**  While the passage doesn't specify isotopes, fusion reactors generally use isotopes of hydrogen (like deuterium and tritium).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nyenyezi (Stars):** Stars *use* fusion, they aren't the fuel *for* fusion.
* **C: Ma atomu (Atoms):**  While atoms are involved, the passage specifically mentions *hydrogen* atoms.  It's too general.
* **D: Mphamvu (Energy):** Energy is the *result* of fusion, not the fuel that goes *into* it.



"
Kodi madzi amapangidwa ndi zinthu ziti?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma atomu awiri a hayidilojini ndi atomu imodzi ya okusijini**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Madzi amapangidwa ndi ma atom awiri a hydrogen ndi atom imodzi ya oxygen."" 

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the information provided in the text."
"Kodi pamene madzi akusintha m’mawonekedwe, chimene sichisintha ndi chiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Makonzedwe ama Molekyuzi ake**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngakhale mawonekedwe ake akhoza kusintha, koma chemical yake imakhala yomweyo."" This means the *chemical composition* remains the same, and the chemical composition is determined by the arrangement of molecules.
* **Molecule Arrangement:** The passage clarifies that whether water is a gas, liquid, or solid (ice), it's *still* made of H₂O molecules.  The molecules themselves don’t change, only how they are arranged and how much energy they have.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kulemera kwake (Weight):** Weight can change slightly due to density differences between states (ice is less dense than water).
* **C: Mawonekedwe ake (Appearance):** The passage directly states that the appearance *does* change.
* **D: Nayitilojini wa madzi (Nitrogen of water):** Water doesn't contain nitrogen; it's made of hydrogen and oxygen. This is a distractor.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nkhani iti yomwe ikunena zowona pam’mene zidalili ndi boma lalikulu munthawi ya Nkhondo Yosintha zinthu?","The correct answer is **C: Oyimilira maboma adalibe kuthekera kowonekera**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that states often ""reluctantly"" agreed to fund things and their delegates ""mostly just debated."" This shows a lack of real power or influence for the state representatives. They weren't able to effectively act independently or push for their states' interests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imakakamizidwa** - While the states were pressured, the passage focuses more on their *inability* to resist due to the structure of the government, not simply being forced.
*   **B: Kusintha kwa malamulo kumatengera ulamuliro wa Kongiresi** - The passage states the opposite; Congress lacked power and relied on the state governments.
*   **D: Boma lalikulu lidali ndi zigawo ziwiri zikuluzikulu** - The passage does not mention two main divisions of the central government. It describes a weak Congress and powerful states.



"
Kodi mawu akumbuyo kwa Chikhazikitso cha Ufulu adalembedwa bwanji?,"The correct answer is **C: Mozondoka**.

The text states: ""Zolembazo zimapezeka pa musi pa chikalata, mozondoka."" which translates to ""The writing is found on the back of the document, slightly detached."""
Kodi dziko la Singapore limadziwika ndi chiyani mwaizi?,"Yoyenera ndi **A: Kubiliwira kwa mizinda**.

Zolemba P zikunena za ku Singapore kukhala ""Garden City"" (Mzinda wa mlimi) komanso za maluwa a orchids omwe adasankhidwa kukhala duwa la dziko. Izi zikusonyeza kuti Singapore imadziwika ndi kulima ndi kukongoletsa ndi miti."
Kodi Vanda Miss Joaquim ndichiyani?,"The correct answer is **B: Maluwa**.

The passage specifically states that ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, mtundu wa maluwa a orchid..."" which translates to ""Vanda Miss Joaquim, a type of orchid flower..."". Therefore, it is a flower.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chilumba:** The passage mentions Singapore as an island, but Vanda Miss Joaquim isn't the island itself.
*   **C: Munda wa zomera wopangira kafukufuku komanso kuwonetsa anthu:** While the Singapore Botanic Gardens are mentioned, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a specific flower *within* that garden, not the garden itself.
*   **D: Chipilala chachikumbutso cha dziko:** It is the national flower, but it is a flower, not a monument."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, Kodi mapiramidi aku Giza adali wowoneka bwino bwanji woti sadali wodabwitsa kwa Ayiguputo Mufumu Watsopano?","Correct answer: **A: Zaka zawo**

Here's why:

The passage states that the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the monuments their ancestors built, *when they were over a thousand years old*. This implies that the pyramids of Giza, while impressive in size and construction, were simply very *old* by the time of the New Kingdom, and it was their age that prompted wonder, not necessarily their original grandeur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kugwiritsa ntchito miyala:** The passage mentions the use of stone, but doesn't suggest this was the reason for amazement.
* **C: Misinkhu yawo:** The passage emphasizes the pyramids' size and skill, but doesn't focus on their shape as a source of wonder for the New Kingdom Egyptians.
* **D: Zomangamanga zawo:** While the pyramids were skillfully built, the passage connects the New Kingdom Egyptians’ wonder to the passage of time, not the construction itself.

Kodi Opareshoni Sealion idali kulowa ndikuchitira chiwembu dziko liti?,"The correct answer is **B: Mangalande**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Germany began preparing to invade the island of Britain.""  ""Operation Sealion"" (the German code name) was the planned invasion of **Britain** (Mangalande in Chichewa).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeremani** - Germany was *launching* the invasion, not the target of it.
*   **C: Fulansi** - France was already at war with Germany, but was not the target of Operation Sealion.
*   **D: Polandi** - Poland was invaded earlier in WWII, before Operation Sealion was planned.



"
Kodi Jeremani idatchula kuti chiyani chiwembu chomwe idachitira Mangalande?,"The correct answer is **B: Opareshoni Sealion**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mchilankhulo chachinsisi chachi German lidatcha chiwembucho “operation sealion”."" (In the German military language, the operation was called “operation sealion”.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dunkirk** - Dunkirk was a location where British troops retreated *from*, not the name of the planned invasion.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine** - This is the name of the German Navy, not the operation.
*   **D: Asilikali apamadzi achifumu** - This means Royal Navy, which was defending Britain, not the German invasion plan.



"
Kodi nchiyani chomwe sichidatchulidwe chomwe ndigawo lofunikira pa dongosolo la dziko la Itale potenga mayiko aku Afilika?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuwonjezera kupanga sitima zina**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Italy's navy was *weak* and that they had only recently built four new warships *before the war started*. It also states their warships shouldn't ""do anything."" This implies they weren't planning on expanding their naval capacity as part of their plan to take African countries.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the text as crucial to Italy's plan:

*   **A: Kuthana ndi sitima za dziko la Eguputo (Confronting Egyptian ships):** The passage directly states Italy needed to remove British forces *and their ships* from Egypt.
*   **C: Kuyambitsa malo woyambira asilikali (Establishing a military base):** The passage stresses the need for ""malo okhazikika a asilikali"" (established military bases) to invade Africa.
*   **D: Kuwononga malo asilikali adziko la Mangalande (Destroying British military bases):**  The passage indicates they needed to remove British military presence to facilitate their invasion.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi kudaganiziridwa kuti cholinga chenicheni pa nkhondo imeneyi ndichiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Kutenga mayiko aku Afilika**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dziko la Italy zolinga zake zinali mayiko aku Africa."" (Italy's goals were countries in Africa). The entire Italian strategy, including needing bases and removing British forces from Egypt, was *in order to* conquer Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kukhala ndi asilikali amphamvu komanso zapamadzi** - The passage notes Italy's army was strong but its navy weak. This wasn't a *goal* of the war, but a description of their starting point.
*   **C: Kuthana ndi sitima za Ayiguputo** - Dealing with Egyptian ships was a *step* toward conquering Africa, not the ultimate goal itself.
*   **D: Kuyambitsa malo asilikali adziko la Mangalande** - Establishing bases was a *means* to an end (conquering Africa), not the goal.

Kodi chidali chitukuko chamtundu wanji cha tekinoloje chomwe chidayambitsa sitima zoyenda pansi pamadzi kuyamba kuyenda pansi pa madzi?,"The correct answer is **D: Rada**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that submarines began to travel underwater ""to avoid radar detection."" This indicates that the development of radar was the technological advancement that prompted submarines to submerge to become less visible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngalawa zokhala ngati chilembo cha U:** This refers to the German submarines (U-boats) themselves, not a technology that caused them to change tactics.
*   **B: Kutalika kwa Mawombeledwe:** This isn't mentioned in the text and isn't relevant to why submarines started going underwater.
*   **C: Mayendedwe:** While submarines *have* improved movement over time, the text points to a specific external factor (radar) as the initial reason for submerging.



"
"Kumayambiliro wogwiritsidwa ntchito, sitima zoyenda pansi pamadzi zidali ndikusathekera kuwombera mgawo liti?","The correct answer is **C: Kuwombera**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kumayambiliro ankhondo, anali kuyenda pa mwamba pamadzi koma kutabwela upangiri wa radar ma submarines anayamba kuyenda pansi pamadzi kuti asaonedwe."" This translates to ""At the beginning of the war, they were traveling on the surface of the water but to avoid radar, submarines began to travel underwater to remain unseen."" This implies their initial function was to *fire* (kuwombera) while on the surface, not just travel or operate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuyenda (Traveling):** While submarines *do* travel, the text emphasizes their ability to fire weapons.
*   **B: Maulendo (Trips):** This is too general and doesn't specify their function.
*   **D: Kuyendetsa (Operating/Driving):** This describes *how* they move, not *what* they did initially.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndindani amene adaphwanya pangano? ","The correct answer is **D: Achitaganya cha Sovieti**.

The passage explicitly states that the Soviet Union (Red Army) violated several treaties: the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, and other international agreements. Therefore, the Soviet Union is the one who broke the agreements.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aku Polandi** - The passage states Polish soldiers were *defeated*, not that they broke treaties.
*   **B: Aku Romaniya** - Romania is only mentioned as a border country, not as a party breaking agreements.
*   **C: Aku Yukileni** - The passage states Ukraine was *occupied* by the Soviets, not that Ukrainians broke treaties.



"
Kodi nchiyani mwaizi zomwe Red Army sidachite?,"The correct answer is **A: Kupanga gulu la asilikali adziko la Yukileni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Red Army formed fronts (military formations) in Belarus and Ukraine.** This eliminates options B, C, and D as the passage *confirms* those actions.
* **The passage does *not* mention anything about creating a military group for a country called ""Yukileni.""**  This is a fabricated detail.

Therefore, the action the Red Army did *not* take, according to the passage, is creating a military group for Yukileni.



"
Kodi chidachitika ndichiyani kwa bwana wamkulu wazokonzakonza wagulu la asilikali a nambala Khumi a dziko la Itale?,"The correct answer is **C: Adagwidwa ndi Angerezi** (He was captured by the English).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pa 28 Juni, a Marshal Italo Balbo, Nkulu woyang'anira Libya komanso wotsatira pa utsogoleri kwa a Mussolini, anaphedwa ndi agulu lawo lomwe pamene amafika ku Tobruk."" This translates to ""On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, commander of Libya and follower of Mussolini, was shot down by his own group as he approached Tobruk."" While the shooting *happened* near Tobruk, he was killed by his own people, not the English. 

However, earlier in the text it says: ""Paupandu anapanga ku m'mawa kwa Bardia, asilikakali aku Britain adagwira Injiniya, General Lastucci, wa gulu la nkhondo la ku Italy lotchedwa Tenth Army."" This translates to ""After positioning themselves east of Bardia, British soldiers captured Engineer, General Lastucci, of the Italian Tenth Army."" 

Therefore, answer C is the closest and most accurate choice.



"
Kodi Italo Balbo adaphedwera kuti?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Pa 28 Juni, a Marshal Italo Balbo, Nkulu woyang'anira Libya komanso wotsatira pa utsogoleri kwa a Mussolini, anaphedwa ndi agulu lawo lomwe pamene amafika ku Tobruk."" 

This directly translates to: ""On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Commander-in-Chief of Libya and follower of Mussolini, was shot down by his own group as he approached Tobruk."""
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi ukadaulo uti mwa izi lomwe ndigawo limodzi lofunikira pamalingaliro ozama a anthu aku Tibeti?","The correct answer is **C: Kuwona ngati masomphenya milungu** (Visualizing deities).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Tibetan Buddhism includes ""kusinkhasinkha"" (tantra) which, *in practice*, involves ""powona milungu yosiyanasiyana mphamvu zimatsukidwa, ma chakra amayambitsidwa ndipo kuunikiridwa kwa pamwamba kumapangidwa"" (visualizing various deities to purify energies, activate chakras, and create enlightenment).  This is presented as a key part of the process.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kuyesera kupuma** (Breathing exercises) - While mentioned as *part* of Kundalini Yoga, it's not highlighted as a core, defining element of the entire system.
*   **B: Kubwereza mamamtira** (Chanting mantras) - Also mentioned as *part* of Kundalini Yoga, but not the central practice described in the context of Tibetan thought.
*   **D: Kukhala kadaulo pamakhalidwe a yoga** (Being skilled in yoga postures) - This is part of Kundalini Yoga, but again, the passage emphasizes the visualization of deities as a key aspect of Tibetan Buddhism, tying it specifically to tantra and enlightenment.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi matchakirazi amayamba bwanji panthawi ya “pakati” pamalingaliro ozama a anthu aku Tibeti?","The correct answer is **B: Podzera powona ngati masomphenya milungu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pakati pakusinkhasinkha kwa Tibetan ndi Mulungu Yoga. Kudzera powona milungu yosiyanasiyana mphamvu zimatsukidwa, ma chakra amayambitsidwa ndipo kuunikiridwa kwa pamwamba kumapangidwa.""

This directly translates to: ""In the middle of Tibetan contemplation is God Yoga. Through *visualizing* various deities, energies are purified, chakras are activated, and higher illumination is created.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Podzera pamakhalidwe a yoga osiyanasiyana:** While yoga is mentioned as part of the practice, the passage specifically describes *visualizing deities* as happening *within* the contemplative process (""pakati"").
*   **C: Pobwereza mamamtira:** Mantras are mentioned as a way to *awaken* Kundalini, but not as what happens during the central contemplation.
*   **D: Kuyesera kupuma:** Breathing exercises are also a part of Kundalini Yoga, but not the core of the contemplative practice described.



"
Kodi amene adayimba nyimbo yachiwiri yauzimu pa mndandandawu ndindani?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Woimba Sanju Sharma anayimba chidzulo kenako **Jai Shankar Choudhary**."" This directly indicates that Jai Shankar Choudhary sang the second devotional song."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, adayimba nyimbo yauzimu pa nthawi yopereka chakudya ndindani?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Lakkha Singh adaimiliranso chhappan bhog bhajan."" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh also sang the Chhappan Bhog bhajan.""  Chhappan Bhog is the offering of 108 items, essentially a devotional offering of food, making the bhajan sung during the offering a spiritual song related to that offering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jai Shankar Choudhary:** He sang a song *before* the offering.
*   **C: Shri Shyam:** Shri Shyam is the deity *receiving* the offering, not the singer.
*   **D: Sanju Sharma:** He sang a song *before* the offering.



"
Kodi gawo lomaliza lachiwiri la zochitika usiku lidali chiyani?,"The correct answer is **B: Moto wa Anatolia**.

The passage states that the Fire of Anatolia performed the final part of the event, dancing to ""Troy"".  The question asks for the *second to last* part, and the text clearly states that came after Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou, and before Fire of Anatolia.
"
Kodi Alessandro Safina ndi nzika ya dziko liti?,"The correct answer is **D: Itale**.

The text states ""woyimba wa ku Italy a Alessandro Safina"". ""Ku Italy"" means ""from Italy""."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nkhani iti mwaizi yomwe siyowona?","Yankho loyenera ndi **B: Anthu adakakamira pa lola kosita**.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndindani amene adapereka ndemanga pokhuza mulingo wakutentha mosakhala bwino?","The correct answer is **B: Mkulu wowona zamoto**.

The passage specifically states that ""Mkulu oyang'anira ozimitsa moto a Scott Kouns adati, “lidali tsiku lotentha kwambiri ku Santa Clara ndi kutentha kwa m'ma 90."" This directly identifies Scott Kouns, the fire chief, as the one making the comment about the temperature.



"
Kodi ndikuti kudazima magetsi kamba kazochitika za tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""...magetsi anathima kwa nthawi yochepa, zimene zidanenedwa kuti zidakanikitsa akuluakulu ku Tonga kulandira chenjezo la tsunami kuchokera ku PTWC."" 

This directly links the power outage to Tonga and the difficulty in receiving the tsunami warning.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi Tonga idakhuzidwa bwanji ndi kuzima kwa magetsi?","The correct answer is **D: Akuluakulu sadathe kulandira machenjezo woyenera**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...magetsi anathima kwa nthawi yochepa, zimene zidanenedwa kuti zidakanikitsa akuluakulu ku Tonga kulandira chenjezo la tsunami kuchokera ku PTWC.""  This directly translates to ""…the power went out briefly, which was said to have prevented officials in Tonga from receiving the tsunami warning from PTWC.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Padali lipoti yoti zinthu zina zidawonongeka** - While the passage says there wasn't *major* damage, it doesn't state there were *no* damages.
*   **B: Akuluakulu sadalandire nkhani zokhuza kuchotsa kwa machenjezo** - The passage says they didn't receive the *initial* warning, not information about warnings being lifted.
*   **C: Zowerenga za m’mene madzi akwelera zidakhuzidwa** - The passage doesn't mention anything about wave readings being affected."

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi kudali kovuta chifukwa chiyani apolisi aku NyuZelandi kudziwa mathamangitsidwe agalimoto amayendetsa a Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **B: Galimoto imayenda pang’onopang’ono kwambiri** (The car is too fast).

Here's why:

The passage states that the police couldn't use their speed measuring devices ""because of the speed of the Black Beauty."" The *only* time they were able to get a reading was when the car slowed down to 160km/h. This directly indicates the car was going too fast for their equipment to handle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pamene amathamangitsa galimoto kuchepera makilomita 160 pa ola limodzi** (When driving the car below 160 kilometers per hour) - The passage says they only *could* measure the speed when it was 160km/h, not that it was a problem when it was slower.
*   **C: Adayendetsa pa mlato kokwana kasanu ndi kawiri basi** (He drove on the bridge only five times) - The number of times he drove across the bridge is irrelevant to the police's ability to measure his speed.
*   **D: Mlatho waku Okulandi Haba ndiwakale kwambiri** (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is too old) - The bridge's age isn't mentioned as a factor in the police's difficulties."
Kodi chivomerezi chidali patipati malingana ndi Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: Mamayilosi 40 chakumwera**.

The text states: ""Chivomerezi chidali pakatikati pa makilomita 20 (mamayilosi 15) kumpoto chamkum'mawa kwa Dillon, ndiponso makilomita 65 (mamayilosi 40) kumwera kwa Butte."" This clearly indicates the earthquake was 40 miles south of Butte."

Kodi udali mtundu wanji wazochitika womwe umafunika kuchitika ku bwalo la zamasewera la Maui War Memorial?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuyimba**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Gulu loyimbali lidasintha chikonzero choimba ku Maui's War Memorial Stadium"" which translates to ""A musical group changed the reason for performing at Maui's War Memorial Stadium."" This clearly indicates that the event is a concert or performance of music (kuyimba).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chiwonetsero cha Matsenga** (Art exhibition) - The text doesn't mention art.
*   **B: Mpira wa Miyendo** (Soccer) - The text doesn't mention soccer.
*   **D: Kusaka ndalama** (Fundraising) - While a concert *could* be a fundraising event, the primary described event is a musical performance.



"
Kodi ndindani amene pamapeto pake adafotokoza zakulephereka kwa zochitikazi?,"The correct answer is **A: Oyimba**.

Here's why:

The passage states the *group* (oyimba) initially didn't provide a reason for cancelling their performance. While HK Management Inc. (the management company) made the initial announcement, the passage implies the group themselves ultimately explained the reason.
"
Anthu ambiri aku Bishkek akuganizira kuti ndindani amene adali patsogolo kuba?,"The correct answer is **C: Wopanga ziwonetsero (Protest organizers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a group of people intending to commit looting walked the streets and robbed shops. It also mentions that people of Bishkek blamed the protestors for breaking the law. This strongly suggests the looting was carried out by, or was linked to, the protest organizers and participants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akuluakulu apolisi (Police officials):** The passage states the police were *not* on the streets, creating the opportunity for looting, but doesn't accuse them of *doing* the looting.
*   **B: Eni magolosale (Business owners):** There's no indication they were involved. They were the victims.
*   **D: Ana wokulako msinkhu (A rich child):** This is irrelevant to the context of the passage.



"
Kodi ndindani adazuzula wochita ziwonetsero akumwera pankhani yakuba?,"The correct answer is **A: Wokhala ku Bishkek**.

The text states: ""Anthu ena aku Bishkek anadzudzula anthu ochita zionetselo akumwera poswa malamulo."" This directly translates to ""Some people in Bishkek criticized the protesters from the south for violating the law.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Akuluakulu apolisi:** The text doesn't say the police criticized anyone. It states they were *absent*, contributing to the chaos.
* **C: Wosokoneza:** The text mentions a group of looters, but doesn't say they did the criticizing.
* **D: Gulu la anthu:**  While ""gulu la anthu"" (group of people) is a general term, the text specifies *people residing in Bishkek* did the criticizing.



"
Kodi ndiliti pamene a Ring adagulitsidwa kwambiri?,"The correct answer is **A: Pamene adawoneka pa Shark Tank**.

Here's why:

The passage states that sales *increased* after appearing on Shark Tank in 2013, even though they didn't receive funding. This suggests it was a significant moment for increased visibility and therefore sales. While the other options mention events in Ring's history, they don't directly indicate a peak in sales like the Shark Tank appearance does.

Kodi ndiliti pamene a Jamie Siminoff adaganiza zoyamba Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Pamene adawona kuti belu lapa khomo pake silidali lokwanira.**

The passage states: ""M'mbuyomo mkulu wa Ring, a Jamie Siminoff, adanenapo kuti kampani idayamba pamene belu lake la chitseko lapachitseko silidamveke mu sitolo mwake kumalo okonzera magalimoto."" This directly indicates that the idea for Ring originated from his own doorbell not working properly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** Shark Tank was *after* the company began, not the reason it started.
*   **C:** He didn't initially receive funding.
*   **D:** QVC was also later in the company's history."
Kodi gawo lililonse la Reading Rainbow lidapereka zofunikira zotani kwa ana?,"The correct answer is **D: Mabuku**.

The passage states: ""Each episode also provides age-appropriate book recommendations for children to seek out when they go to their local libraries."" This directly indicates that each segment of the show provided book recommendations for children.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ziwonetsero zapa kanema** - While Reading Rainbow *was* a TV show, the question asks what the show provided *to* children, not what it *was*.
*   **B: Mnyumba zowerengera za mdera** - The show encouraged children to *go to* libraries, but didn't *provide* them.
*   **C: Mitu** - The show focused on topics *within* books, but didn't provide the topics themselves.



"
Kodi chingakhale kuti chidachititsa ndi chiyani kuti magawo a Reading Rainbow alephereke?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuchepekera kwa thandizo lachuma (Decreased funding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Anthu ena amakhulupira kuti , kuphatikiza a John Grant, kuti kutsika kobwereketsa ndalama ndikusintha mu chikhulupiliro cha mndandanda wa maphunziro pa kanema kudanthandiza kuthetsa mndandanda wa zochitika."" This directly translates to: ""Some people believe that, including John Grant, that decreasing funding and a shift in belief in educational programming on television helped end the series.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kusowa kwa mphoto za Emmy (Lack of Emmy awards)**: The passage explicitly states *Reading Rainbow* *has* over 20 Emmy awards, so this isn't a reason for its failure.
* **C: Maganizo a John Grant (John Grant’s opinions)**: John Grant supports the show and its benefits, not a reason for its cancellation.
* **D: Kupambana kwa dera la bambo Rogers (Success of Mr. Rogers’ neighborhood)**: While the passage mentions *Mr. Rogers*, it doesn’t suggest his success caused *Reading Rainbow* to fail. They are presented as comparable shows.

*   **C: Uli ndimatenga a fangasi** - Mtengowo wagwidwa ndi fangasi, omwe akuluakulu akudziwa.
*   **D: Ndiwopereka chiwopsezo ku umoyo wa anthu** - Akuluakulu akudziwa mtengowo ndi wopereka chiwopsezo ku umoyo wa anthu."
"Malingana ndi bwana wamkulu wazoyenderayendera ku RSPCA, kuyendera kuyenera kukhala kofanana pa zinthu ziti mwaizi?","The correct answer is **D: Malo ophereko nyama**.

Here's why:

The passage states David O'Shannessy believes ""monitoring and inspections need to be consistent across **all abattoirs in Australia**."" He then highlights CCTV as a tool to achieve this consistency. This means he's advocating for consistent practices *at* abattoirs, not consistent monitoring of the other options listed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makamera achitetezo a CCTV** - CCTV is a *method* of monitoring, not what the monitoring should be consistent *across*.
*   **B: Aliyense amene akugwira ntchito ndi nyama** - While important, the focus is on consistency at the *location* of slaughter, not necessarily the individual handlers.
*   **C: Kuyika Zoyang’anira** - This refers to the *act* of monitoring, not the places where it should happen."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi chingathandize kulimbikitsa ubwino wowona ufulu wanyama kwa anthu ogwira ntchito kumalo ophera nyama ku Ositeleliya ndi chiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Kuyika makamera achitetezo a CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage states that David O'Shannessy believes CCTV ""will send a strong signal to those caring for the animals that their care is under scrutiny."" This directly implies that the presence of CCTV will encourage better treatment of animals by making workers aware they are being watched.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kukhala ndi mikumano yokakamiza ndi a RSPCA:** The passage doesn't mention forced meetings with the RSPCA as a solution.
*   **C: Kuyendera kawirikawiri malo ophera nyama:** While the passage mentions inspecting slaughterhouses, it highlights CCTV as the primary means of encouraging better care.
*   **D: Kuwunikiridwa ndi a ABC:** The ABC is simply reporting the news; being monitored by them isn't what encourages better animal welfare.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi amene adamangidwa amagwira ntchito yotani?","The correct answer is **A: Wophunzira (Student)**.

The passage states: ""...wophunzila m'modzi anamangidwa pokhuzidwa ndi kuombera ku sukulu..."" which translates to ""...one student was arrested in connection with the shooting at the school..."" 

Therefore, the person arrested is a student."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, pamene nkhani zidali kufala kuti wina amangidwaso, kodi mwambo wamaliro udali kuchikitika wa anthu angati wokhudzidwa?","The correct answer is **B: Atatu**.

The passage states: ""...and three of the five individuals involved in the shooting have been confirmed dead..."" This means that when the news of an arrest was spreading, three of the five people involved in the shooting had already died."
"Poyankhapo pa ziwonetsero, kodi ndi dziko liti lomwe silidapite chitsogolo ndi mgwirizano womwe adasayina wa ACTA?","The correct answer is **B: Polandi**.

Here's why:

The text states, ""Mwezi watha, anthu amachita ziwonetselo zikuluzikulu ku Poland pamene dziko lidasayina ACTA, zimenezi zidapangitsa boma la Poland kuti lisavomereze mgwilizano pakadali pano."" This directly states that Poland *did* sign ACTA but then paused ratification due to protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jeremani** - Germany is mentioned as having protests, but not as having signed and then paused ACTA.
*   **C: Sikotilandi** - Scotland (specifically Edinburgh and Glasgow) had protests, but isn't a country that signed ACTA.
*   **D: Lisuwaniya** - Lithuania is mentioned as having protests, but there's no indication it signed and then paused ACTA.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi mayiko ati mwa awa omwe adati adaganiza zozalowabe mtsogolo mu ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Lativiya**.

The text states: ""Latvia and Slovakia both postponed the process of entering into ACTA."" This means Latvia decided to delay joining ACTA, implying consideration of not joining at all.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Esitoniya** - The text only mentions protests in Estonia, not any change in their ACTA plans.
*   **B: Lisuwaniya** - The text only mentions protests in Lithuania, not any change in their ACTA plans.
*   **C: Sikotilandi** - The text mentions protests in Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow), but not any change in their ACTA plans.



"
Kodi ndi anthu angati omwe adavulala chifukwa kwakutentha kwambiri kwa iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...ikuvulaza anthu anayi omwe anali ndi mabala akupsa koma osati akuluakulu."" (and injured four people who had minor burns but not serious injuries). 

The other numbers mentioned refer to the number of incidents reported or known about, not the number of people injured."
Kodi ndi ndani amene adanena kuti nkhani yakutentha kwambiri sidali yayikulu?,"The correct answer is **D: Kampani ya Apple**.

The text states that Apple described the additional 34 overheating incidents as ""minor issues."" This is the statement indicating they didn't consider the overheating a major problem.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: METI** - METI criticized Apple for *not* reporting the issues properly, implying they *did* consider them significant.
*   **B: Eni ake ama iPod omwe adakhuzidwa** - The text states they were injured, so it's unlikely they would downplay the seriousness.
*   **C: Gawo lowona zamoto ku Japani** - The text doesn't mention a specific fire department division.



"
Kodi mkulankhula kwawo a Steve Jobs adati kampani ya Apple ipangaso chiyani?,"The correct answer is **B: Foni**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states Steve Jobs said, ""Lero Apple ipanganso **foni**..."" (Today Apple will make another **phone**...). 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mbiri** - He said they would *make* history, not *make* history itself.
*   **C: Kampani** - He was talking about a product, not the company itself.
*   **D: Luso** - While the iPhone involved technology, he specifically mentioned making a phone.



"
Kodi cholinga chakulankhula kwa a Steve Jobs kwa maola awiri chidali chiyani?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuyambitsa foni yatsopano**.

The passage explicitly states that Steve Jobs was unveiling a phone, and said ""Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone."" This clearly indicates the purpose of his two-hour speech was to launch a new phone (the iPhone)."
Kodi a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adalengeza chiyani pa Bwalo la Zitsuzo la Argenitine?,"Yoyenera ndiyo **A: Kuyima nawo pa udindo wawu pulezidenti**.

Kodi ndikuti komwe Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner adalengeza cholinga chawo chofuna kupikisana nawo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubwalo la zitsuzo la Argentine lomwe lili mamayilosi 31 kuchokera ku Buenos Aires**.

Here's why:

* The passage states she announced her candidacy at the ""Argentine Theatre,"" which is located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires in La Plata. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Incorrectly states the distance is from La Plata.
* **B:** Incorrectly combines Buenos Aires and La Plata as one location.
* **D:** Incorrectly states the theatre is in La Plata and then repeats Buenos Aires.



"
Kodi ACMA adapeza chiyani malingana ndi Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Malamulo woletsa kuwonera kapena kumvera zosayenera sadaphwanyidwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Big Brother sidaphwanye malamulo azoletsa zapa intaneti chifukwa kanemayo sidasungidwe patsamba lawo intaneti la Big Brother."" This directly translates to ""Big Brother did not violate the laws prohibiting inappropriate viewing or listening because the video was not hosted on Big Brother's website.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage explicitly states the content *wasn't* on Big Brother's website.
* **C:** The passage states the laws *weren't* broken.
* **D:** While the passage mentions servers, it doesn't say the content was *found* on a server. It explains *why* the law wasn't broken – because of where the content was hosted.



"
Kodi ndi zoyenerera ziti zomwe ndi zowonera kapena kumvera ziyenera kuganiziridwa kuti ndizoyenera kukhala pa tsamba la intaneti?,"The correct answer is **C: Siziyenera kusungidwa pa tsamba la intaneti**.

Here's why:

The passage (P) specifically states that Big Brother didn't violate internet regulations because the video wasn't *hosted* on their website. The law focuses on content being stored on servers (hosting). This implies that to avoid violating the rules, content shouldn't be stored on the website itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ziyenera kuwoneredwa pa intaneti pompo** - This doesn't relate to the legal aspect discussed in the passage.
*   **B: Ziyenera kusungidwa pa makina akompyuta akulu otchedwa seva** - The passage implies that *hosting* on servers is relevant to regulation, but doesn't say what is permissible. It's the *website* hosting that's key.
*   **D: Ziyenera zivomerezedwe ndi a ACMA** - ACMA *investigated* but the passage doesn't state that content needs their approval to be online.



"
Kodi mtsogoleri wachipani cha Liberal ku Ositeleliya ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **A: A Peter Costello**.

The text states, ""Peter Costello, msungichuma waku Australia, amene akuyembekezeleka kuzalowa mpando wa Prime Minister wa a John Howard ngati mtsogoleri wa chipani cha Liberal..."" which translates to ""Peter Costello, Australia's Treasurer, who is expected to succeed John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party...""

Therefore, Peter Costello is identified as the expected leader of the Liberal Party."

Kodi ndi wowuluka uti yemwe adamaliza potengera thandizo losogoleredwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Skier wosawona wam'muna waku Poland a Maciej Krezel pamodzi ndiwowatsogolera njira a Anna Ogarzynska adamalizira nambala 13 mu mpikisano wa Super-G.""  This means Maciej Krezel competed with a guide (Anna Ogarzynska), and therefore competed with guided assistance.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anna Jochemsen** - Competed independently.
*   **B: Jong Seork Park** - Competed independently.
*   **D: Anna Ogarzynska** - Was a guide *for* Maciej Krezel, not a competitor receiving assistance.



"
Kodi ndi dziko liti lomwe lidamalizira nambala 10 mu mpikisano wa Super-G wa azimayi woyimilira?,"The correct answer is **A: Finilandi**.

The text states: ""Finland wawo adali Katja Saarinen kumalizitsa khumi pa masewera omwewa."" (Their Finland was Katja Saarinen finishing tenth in the same competition). This refers to the women's standing Super-G competition."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi nkhani iti yokhuza a Blake yomwe siyowona?","The correct answer is **B: Adavomera zachiwembuchi** (He admitted guilt).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Blake *contested* the charge (meaning he denied guilt), not admitted it.
*   The other options are directly stated in the text:
    *   **A: Adamangidwa pamalo pomwepo** (Was arrested at the scene) - ""Wolankhulayo, yemwe adamangidwa pamalopo...""
    *   **C: Adagwiritsa ntchito pholo pa chiwembuchi** (Used a knife in the incident) - ""...adagwiritsa ntchito mzati kuti adziteteze...""
    *   **D: Adanena kuti amagendedwa ndimabotolo** (Said he was pelted with bottles) - ""... kuti adziteteze ku mabotolo omwe amaponyedwa kwa iye ndi anthu makumi atatu.""

Therefore, only option B contradicts the information given in the passage."
"Potengera ndimeyi, ndi chiti mwaizi chomwe sichinachitike kwa a Blake?","The correct answer is **C: Adavulazidwa ndi pholo** (He was injured by a bottle).

Here's why:

*   **The text states Blake *was accused* of attempting to pervert justice (A), was released from custody (D), and was arrested (B).** However, there is no mention in the text that Blake himself was injured by a bottle. The text indicates *the speaker* was defending himself *from* bottles being thrown *at him*.

Therefore, the only option that isn't stated or implied in the text is that Blake was injured by a bottle."
Kodi thandizo la chuma la U.N. pankhani zakusintha kwa nyengo pa dziko lonse sizingagwiritsidwe ntchito pa zotani?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuchepetsa zotsatira zakusintha kwa nyengo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the U.N. hopes the funding will help countries *reduce the effects* of climate change (""achepetse zotsatira zavutoli"").  The examples given (flood-proof housing, water management, drought-resistant seeds) are all *ways* to reduce those effects, but the overarching goal of the funding is the reduction itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kasinthasintha wa mbewu** - This is *an example* of how the money might be used, not the overall purpose.
*   **B: Kubweretsa maukadaulo a tekinoloje ku mayiko wotukuka kumene** - The passage mentions technology sharing to help *developing* countries, not developed ones.
*   **C: Nyumba zomwe zili zotetezedwa kumadzi wosefukila** - Again, this is a *specific example* of a project the funding could support, not the broader purpose.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi a U.N. akuyembekezera kuteteza chiyani?","The correct answer is **C: Nkhalango zamvula zomwe zatsala**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the meeting will focus on ""kuteteza nkhalango zomwe zatsala padziko lapansi"" (protecting the remaining rainforests). This is a direct objective of the discussions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndalama, podzera kugawana maukadaulo a tekinoloje** - While funding and technology sharing *are* mentioned, they are means to an end (helping countries and adapting to climate change) – not what the UN is directly trying to *protect*.
*   **B: Mbewu** - Seed adaptation is mentioned as something the funding *could* help with, but it’s not the primary focus of the UN’s protective efforts.
*   **D: Anthu womwe akhuzidwa ndikulephera kusamalira madzi** - The passage mentions helping those affected by climate change *including* water management, but it doesn't say the UN is trying to protect these people specifically.



"
Kodi ndi chiyani mwaizi chomwe a Albert Muchanga sadanenepo ngati china chake chomwe chikufunikabe kugwirizana?,"Correct answer is **C: Malamulo oyambilira**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: “Sitidagwirizanepo pa **malamulo akomwe kukuchokera katundu ndiponso mitengo yamsonkho**, koma ndondomeko imene ilipo ndiyokwanira kuti tiyambe malonda pa 1 Julayi 2020.” This directly indicates that rules of origin and tariff rates were the outstanding issues needing agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngati dziko la Benini lingalowe mu AfCTA** - Albert Muchanga adalengeza kuti Benin idzalowa mu AfCTA, so this wasn't something they disagreed on.
*   **B: Tsiku lomwe malondawo angayambe** - They *did* agree on a start date (July 1st, 2020).
*   **D: Kuchotsa misonkho ina** - The passage specifically mentions tariff rates (which are a type of tax), so it's about tariffs, not other taxes in general.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi nchifukwa chiyani malonda angayambe mu Julaye?","Yoyenera ndiye **B: Pali ndondomeko zamalamulo zokwanira komanso kuchotsa misonkho ina**

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi Atlanta Journal- Constitution akudzudzula akuluakulu azamaphunziro pankhani yanji?","The correct answer is **C: Kulephera kutengako mbali kuthesa mavuto apachiweniweni omwe adapezeka.**

Here's why:

The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution ""reported findings showing troubling test results"" and that the problems were ""witnessed by school officials but not acted upon."" This directly indicates the newspaper is criticizing the officials for *failing to take action* on the cheating they observed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kusintha lipoti ya Journal- Constitution** - The passage doesn’t suggest the newspaper is changing its reporting, but rather *reporting* on a problem.
*   **B: Kulephera kusintha maphunziro am’mizinda** - The criticism isn't about a general failure to improve education, but specifically about ignoring cheating.
*   **D: Kupereka lipoti yowonesa ana kusakhoza bwino kwambiri** - The report exposed *cheating* inflating scores, not a natural lack of ability in students.



"
"Kutengera ndi zomwe mwapatsidwa pa ndimeyi, kodi chomwe sichinatchulidwe mu lipoti ya Atlanta Journal-Constitution ndichiyani?","Correct answer is **A: Kusintha kwabwino kosayembekezereka kwa kakhonzedwe ka ana**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** The Atlanta Journal-Constitution report showed ""significant increases in test scores"" that were suspicious. It doesn't mention anything about improvements in student *performance* or *well-being* (kakhonzedwe ka ana) - only the test scores themselves.
*   **The passage states:** Evidence later showed test answer sheets were manipulated. (B is correct)
*   **The passage states:** He received the National Superintendent award in 2009. (C is incorrect - it was 2009, not 2013)
*   **The passage states:** He was known for high-achieving urban school systems. (D is correct)

Therefore, the one thing *not* mentioned in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report is changes in the students' overall education."

*   **C: Ngati padali kuwonjezera kuphulitsa mabomba ena** - Zolemba sizingakhulule za kuphulitsa mabomba ena."
"Kodi chiyambireni pamene adalowa Manchester City mu chaka cha 2017, Jesus adasewera m’masewero angati?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Kuchokela pamenepo, munthu wa ku Brazil anasewela masewero 53 a timu yake mumipikisano yonse..."" This directly answers the question of how many games Jesus played since joining Manchester City in 2017."
Kodi Jesus adalandira mamiliyoni £27 kuchokera ku kalabu iti ngati dipo lolowera kalabuyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalabu ya Palmeiras**.

The text states that Jesus moved from Palmeiras to Manchester City *for* £27 million. This means Palmeiras received the money as a transfer fee."
Kodi ndi nkhani iti yomwe siyowona yokhuza alendo wokhala ku hositelo?,"The correct answer is **D: Alendo ambiri adali wochokera ku mzinda woyera.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the majority of the pilgrims were citizens of the United Arab Emirates.** A ""holy city"" is a general term, and doesn't specify the UAE. This makes option D the false statement.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: Alendo adali ku Mecca paulendo wachipembezo** - The passage explicitly states they were there for religious reasons and the Hajj pilgrimage.
* **B: Alendo ena sadali nzika za mdziko momo** -  The text states many were from the United Arab Emirates, implying some were *not* from Mecca.
* **C: Alendo adali kumeneko kudikila usiku wa hajj** - The passage mentions they came to see the holy city during the evening of Hajj.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi nkhani iti mwaizi yomwe siyowona?","The correct answer is **B: Alendo wonse adali wochokera ku United Arab Emirates**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that **many** of the pilgrims who stayed in the guest house were from the United Arab Emirates, not *all* of them.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **A: Padalibe womwalira** - This is false. The passage explicitly states 15 people have died and the number is expected to rise.
*   **C: Alendo adali kumeneko chifukwa cha ulendo wachipembezo ndipo adali kudikila usiku wa hajj** - This is true. The passage states they were there for pilgrimage and to witness the Hajj.
*   **D: Alendo ambiri adali womwe amakhala ku Mecca konko** - While the passage doesn't directly state where most pilgrims live generally, it's logical to assume many come *to* Mecca from elsewhere for pilgrimage, rather than residing there. The focus is on them being pilgrims, not residents.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndizotani zokhuza kugundana kumeneku zomwe ndizoziwikiratu?","The correct answer is **A: Kukula kogundana** (The size of the explosion).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Akatsayi azasayansi anena kuti kuphulika komwe kudachitika kamba kogundanako kudali kwakukulu kwambiri."" (Scientists say the explosion that occurred was very large.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Komwe kudachitikila ngozi yogundana** (Where the accident happened) - The passage states it happened 491 miles above Earth, but the question asks what is *known* about the impact. While the altitude is mentioned, it's not the main focus of what's being established.
* **C: Zotsatira zobwera padziko lapansi kamba kogundana** (Effects on Earth from the explosion) - The passage says scientists are *investigating* this (""Akadayesabe kufufuza m'mene ngoziyo inakulira ndipo m'mene dziko lapansi likhudzidwire""), but it doesn't state what the effects *are*.
* **D: Komwe kuli zotsalira** (Where the debris is) - The passage mentions tracking debris (""ikutsata ziduswa""), but it doesn't say where the debris *is* located, only that it is being tracked.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndichiyani chomwe chiyenera kuganiziridwa pangoziyi?","The correct answer is **D: Kukula kwake kwa ngoziyi** (The size of the explosion).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Akatswiri azasayansi anena kuti kuphulika komwe kudachitika kamba kogundanako kudali kwakukulu kwambiri."" (Scientists say the explosion that occurred was very large.)  The passage focuses on investigating *how* the explosion happened and its *impact* on Earth, highlighting its significant scale.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kodi ndindani amene azalondoloze zotsalira** (Who will salvage the remains) - The passage doesn't mention salvage efforts.
* **B: Kodi masetilayiti amathamanga kwambiri bwanji panthawi ya ngoziyo** (How fast were the satellites traveling at the time of the accident) - While the speed is mentioned, it’s a description of the satellites, not a key factor being investigated regarding the *accident itself*.
* **C: Kodi zotsatira za kuwunikidwa kwa ngoziyo zizagawidwa bwanji** (How will the results of the accident investigation be distributed) - This is mentioned as a result of the investigation (""Zotsatira za plotting analysis ziyikidwa patsamba la intaneti..."") but is not the primary thing that needs to be considered *about* the accident.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, Kodi a Batten adali nambala chiyani pa mndandanda wa anthu wolemera kwambiri ku Amerika?","The correct answer is **C: Panambala 190**.

The passage states: ""A Batten adayikidwa pamulingo wa nambala 190 pamndandanda wa chaka cha 2008 wa anthu 400 wolemera aku America..."" This directly answers the question."
Kodi ndikuti mwamalo awa a Bateni adapereka zinthu mwaulere?,"The correct answer is **C: Mabungwe wochulukirapo ndithu**.

Here's why:

The passage states Batten ""helped the University significantly"". This implies he made donations or provided support to various organizations *within* the university, rather than just the specific college or a free list of wealthy people. ""Mabungwe wochulukirapo ndithu"" (many organizations) is the broadest and most fitting answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mndandanda wa anthu wolemera aku Amerika** - The passage only mentions he *was on* the list, not that he donated to it.
*   **B: Sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Yunivesite ya Vijiniya** - While he graduated from the College of Arts & Sciences, the passage indicates his support was broader than just that specific school.
*   **D: Makoleji omwe amapanga zamaluso ndi Sayansi** - Too specific; his help was to the *University* as a whole.

Kodi ndi sigawo liti lamalamulo lomwe bwana mkubwa Arnold Schwarzenegger adasayinira?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuletsa kugulitsa kapena kubwereketsa makanena aupanda amasewera kwa ana mu Kalifoniya monse** (Prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to children throughout California).

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Lamuloli likufuna kuti masewelo apa kanema mchigawo cha California azikhala ndi chizindikilo cha “18” ndipo kuti kugulitsa kwa ana kudziletsedwa..."" (The law requires video games in the state of California to have an ""18"" rating and that sales to children are prohibited...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wolakwa azipereka chindapusa cha ndalama** (The offender will pay a fine) - While the passage *mentions* a fine, it's a *result* of the law, not the law itself.
* **C: Kuletsa kugulitsa kapena kubwereketsa makanena aupanda amasewera kwa ana kunja kwa Kalifoniya** (Prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to children outside of California) - The law applies *within* California, as stated in the passage.
* **D: Kufunikira kwa chizindikiro pa masewera onse aupandu** (Requirement for a rating on all violent games) - The rating requirement is part of the law, but the core of the law is restricting sales to children.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi amene sadamve zomwe zimanenedwa ndi ndani?","The correct answer is **C: A Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Miller was preparing to leave because of how much Mike was talking. This implies Miller was trying to *avoid* hearing what Mike was saying. Therefore, Miller is the one who didn't listen to what was being said.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndichiyani mwaizi chomwe ndichowona kwa a Miller pakumvetsera mlandu?","Yoyenera yankho ndi **B: Sadali kukhala ndi chidwi panthawi yomwe amakonzekera**.

Kodi amene adaganizira zoti pakhale kusintha kwa the ‘Clean Air Act’ ndindani?,"The correct answer is **C: A Jack Layton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A Layton adapempha kuti malamulo okhuza zachilengedwe asinthidwe pamene adakomana ndi a PM, ndipo adafunsa kuti “alembedwenso bwinobwino komanso kwathunthu” monga mwa lamulo la zachilengedwe la chipani cha Conservative."" This directly indicates that Jack Layton requested changes to the environmental laws, including the 'Clean Air Act'.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A John Howard:** The text mentions John Howard discussing funding for a hospital, not the Clean Air Act.
*   **B: Chipani cha Konzevetivu:** While Layton asked for changes *in line with* the Conservative's environmental law, the party itself didn't request changes to the 'Clean Air Act'.
*   **D: A Stephen Harper:** Stephen Harper agreed to send the bill to committee, but Layton was the one who *asked* for revisions.



"
Kodi ndindani amene adakana kuti ‘Clean Air Act’ idali kugwiritsidwa ngati chomemera anthu nthawi yachisankho isanafike?,"The correct answer is **A: Akuluakulu aboma**.

Here's why:

The text states that after the federal government began providing funding to the Mersey hospital, ""boma komanso aphungu ena achitaganya"" (the government and other Tasmanian members) criticized this as being surprising with Tasmanian elections coming in November. This suggests they felt it was a political move intended to gain votes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nduna Yayikulu (Prime Minister)** - While the Prime Minister is part of the government, the text specifically mentions both the government *and* other members criticizing the decision.
*   **C: Mtsogoleri wa NDP (NDP Leader)** - Jack Layton was focused on the 'Clean Air Act' and requesting amendments, not commenting on the hospital funding.
*   **D: MP wachitaganya (Tasmanian MP)** - While some Tasmanian MPs were critical, the criticism came from the government as a whole *and* other members.



"
Kodi mankhwala a cyanuric acid ndi melamine amapanga chiyani akasanganizidwa limodzi mumkodzo wa mphaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Impso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zinthu ziwirizi zikalumikizana, zimapanga timibulu timene tingalepheretse impso kugwira ntchito."" This directly translates to ""These two substances, when combined, form crystals that can prevent the kidneys from functioning.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chakudya chanyamba zoweta zongosunga zamsangulutso basi (Contaminated pet food with only storage preservatives)** - The passage focuses on what *happens* in the kidney, not the source of the contamination.
*   **C: Makilisitozi (Crystals)** - While the passage mentions crystals are formed, the key is that these crystals *affect the kidneys*.
*   **D: Spectroscopy ya Infrared (Infrared spectroscopy)** - FTIR is a *method* used to identify the crystals, not what the substances create.



"

Kodi ndi ndani amene adati Luna ndiwa “Mfumukazi Yowonjeza”?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: “Tommy Dreamer adati “Luna adali woyamba kukhala Mfumukazi ya Extreme.” 

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who said Luna was the “Queen of Extreme”."
Kodi ndi ndani amene adati Luna ndiwa “misala”?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**. 

The text states: ""Dustin “Goldust” Runnels adati “Luna adali wodabwitsa m'mene ndilili ine... mwinaso kopitilira muyezo... ndimamukonda komanso ndizamusowa... ndikukhulupilira kuti ali kumalo abwino.”"" 

While ""misala"" isn't a direct translation, the context suggests Dustin Runnels is describing Luna as something exceptional and perhaps a bit wild (""kopitilira muyezo""), which can be interpreted as a playful way of saying she was unique or ""misala.""



"
Kodi sichidachitike nchiyani kwa dalayivala amene adachita ngozi?,"The correct answer is **C: Adachotsedwa kuchokera kuchipatala chaku Cambridge kupita ku Great Yarmouth**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The driver was *first* taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth, and *then* transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.  Option C states the opposite order.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adavulala ku mutu** - The passage explicitly states the driver sustained a head injury (""adavulala modetsa nkhawa ku mutu"").
* **B: Sadavulaze aliyense amene adali mkati mwanyumba** - The passage clearly states no one inside the house was injured.
* **D: Wogwira ntchito zangozi adamuthandiza kumuchotsa mugalimoto mwake** - The passage states emergency workers helped rescue the driver from the car (""ogwira ntchito zadzidzidzi anathandizira kupulumutsa dilayivala mu galimoto"").



"
Kodi sichidali chiyani chomwe South Africa idawoneka nacho maseweredwe ake mumpikisano wa ragibe?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuchita bwino kumayambiliro kwa mpikisano**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Womwe adasankhidwa apamwamba mumpikisanowu dziko la South Africa lidayamba bwino pamene adapambana 26-00 kugonjetsa timu idasankhidwa panambala 5 ya Zambia."" This directly indicates they performed well at the beginning of the competition.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kugwilira ntchito limodzi mosangalatsa (Working together happily):** While the text mentions teamwork (""kusewera limodzi ngati timu""), it doesn't focus on the *happiness* of that teamwork.
* **B: Kutha kukhazikitsa mpira (Ability to establish the ball):** The passage doesn't specifically mention ball handling skills.
* **D: Luso lotchinga (Tackling skill):**  While good defense is mentioned (""Oteteza awo ndi odalilika""), it doesn't highlight tackling as a standout skill.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi South Africa idayamba kuchita bwino pamasewerawa nthawi yanji?","The correct answer is **D: Pamene mpikisano umapitilira**.

The text states: ""South Africa idayamba kuchita bwino mwadongosolo **pamene mpikisano unali kupitilira**."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pakati pa 10 koloko m’mawa** - The game started at 10:00, but the text doesn't say they started playing well *at* 10:00.
*   **B: Pamene adakhwimitsa wotchinga kumbuyo** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Pambuyo polephera kutimu ya Zambia** - While they won against Zambia, the text doesn't say their good performance started *after* defeating Zambia, but as the competition progressed.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi nkhani ziti mwaizi zomwe sizipereka chithunzithunzi chowona pazachuma cha dziko la China?","The correct answer is **D: Dziko la China silidatumizepo magalimoto ambiri kunja kuposa Jeremani**.

Here's why:

* **The passage *directly states* that China sold more cars than Germany last year.** Therefore, saying China *didn't* export more cars than Germany is a misrepresentation of the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the passage:

* **A: Chuma chadzilo la China chakwera mwansanga kuyambira pamene adayamba kusintha zinthu** - The passage states the economy has grown ""90-fold"" since the reforms began, supporting this statement.
* **B: Dziko la China liri ndi msika waukulu wogulitsa magalimoto kunja kuposa Amerika** - The passage explicitly says China surpassed the US as the largest car market.
* **C: Dziko la China litha kukhala ndi GDP yayikulu kuposa Amerika** - The passage states China's GDP *could* surpass America's in two decades.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi GDP ya China izapambana liti ya United States?","The correct answer is **B: Mkati mwazaka makumi awiri**.

The passage explicitly states: ""GDP yaku China itha kukhala yayikulu kuposa yaku America muzaka makumi awiri."" (China's GDP may be larger than America's in two decades.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Potsatira zosintha zambiri pa zachuma** - While economic reforms are mentioned as *leading* to this possibility, the passage doesn't say GDP will surpass the US *because of* the reforms, just *within* a timeframe.
* **C: Pamene dziko lili ndi utsogoleri watsopano** - The passage doesn't link the GDP surpassing to a change in leadership.
* **D: Mkati mwazaka makumi atatu** - The passage specifically mentions ""makumi awiri"" (two decades), not ""makumi atatu"" (three decades).



"
Kodi a Hu adaganizira kuti mayiko wotukuka kumene achite chiyani?,"The correct answer is **D: Apewe njira zakale zowononga chilengedwe.**

Here's why:

The passage directly quotes Hu as saying developed countries should ""avoid the old practice of polluting first and governing later."" This is a clear call to avoid environmentally damaging practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kutenga udindo womwe ndiwothandiza kupititsa chitukuko pamlingo wina** - While responsibility is mentioned, the specific context is about environmental responsibility, not general development.
*   **B: Kulunjika pa zotsatira za chuma** - The passage mentions basing reduction targets *on* economic results, but doesn't say developed countries should focus *on* them.
*   **C: Kupitilira patsogolo kuposera maudindo awo atsopano** - The passage stresses avoiding a specific, harmful path, not simply exceeding responsibilities.



"
Kodi nchiyani chomwe a Hu sadanenepo?,"The correct answer is **D: Nambala yakatsikidwe kotulutsira m’pweya wa kaboni**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sadakhazikitse nambala yakachepetsedwe, ponena kuti izapangidwa potengera zotsatira za chuma cha China."" This means Hu did *not* establish a specific number for carbon emission reduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mfundo zochepetsera:** The passage clearly mentions the *goal* of reducing emissions.
*   **B: Malangizo kumayiko wokwera kumene pankhani yowonga chilengedwe:** Hu *did* give advice to developed countries to avoid ""old patterns of polluting first and governing later"".
*   **C: Tsiku lomwe m’pweya wa kaboni tiyembekezere kuchepa ndi:** The passage mentions a target year (2020) relative to a base year (2005), establishing a timeframe for the reduction.



"
Kodi ndi ziti mwaizi zomwe a Veerman adati zinthu sizili bwino?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Richard Veerman of Medecines Sans Frontiere said: “Angola is heading for a very serious outbreak and things are bad in Angola,” he said."" 

He specifically says ""things are bad **in Angola**"". The question asks what he said things were not good with.



"
"Malingana ndikuzengedwa milandu, ndi ndani amene azatenge udindo wa nduna yaboma omwe udali wa a Huhne?","The correct answer is **A: A Davey**.

The text states: ""a Ed Davey MP atenga malo awo ngati nduna."" (Ed Davey MP takes their place as minister.) This directly answers the question of who replaced Huhne."
"Malingana ndikuzengedwa milandu, ndi ndani amene azatenge udindo wa Nduna yaboma yowona za Malonda?","The correct answer is **A: A Lamb**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Norman Lamb atenga Unduna wa Business umene a Davey akusiya."" This directly translates to ""Norman Lamb takes the Business Ministry that Davey is leaving."" Therefore, Norman Lamb is now in charge of the Department for Business."
Kodi ndi chiyani chomwe opanga zitsuzo amalimbikitsa owonelera kupanga munthawi ya opera ya Camille Saint-Saens?,"Correct answer is **A: Kutenga mbali pogwiritsa ntchito kanabisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states the opera features an artist whose life is ruled by a drug habit and fascination with Japan, and that the opera ""encourages the audience to partake.""  The context of the drug habit points to cannabis use (""suta tidziduswa tachamba""). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kupanga ulendo wopita ku Japan:** While Japan is mentioned, the opera *encourages participation* in something, not travel.
*   **C: Pitani pa malo iyimbilapo kuti musangalale nawo:** This is a general encouragement for attending an opera, not a specific action inspired by the plot.
*   **D: Lolani kuti moyo wawo uziyendera zomwe iwo akufuna:** This is too broad and doesn't relate to the specific encouragement mentioned in the passage.

"""Kodi dzina lina la """"spacewalk"""" imene Leanov anapanga ndi chiyani?""","The correct answer is **C: Zochitika kunja kwa galimoto ya asitilonati**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that ""extravehicular activity (EVA) or “spacewalk”..."" This directly defines ""spacewalk"" as extravehicular activity.
*   Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    *   **A: Ntchito ya Apollo-Soyuz** - This was a mission Leonov *led* later in his career, not a name for a spacewalk.
    *   **B: Mpikisano wa m’mlengalenga** - This is the overall context of the space race, not a name for a spacewalk.
    *   **D: Cosmonaut No. 11** - This is a designation for Leonov's team, not the spacewalk itself.



"
Kodi Leonov anatsogolera ma Soviet mbali iti ya ntchitoyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage states: ""Patapita zaka khumi, adatsogolera mbali ya Soviet yotchedwa Apollo-Soyuz..."" which directly answers the question.
"
Kodi adavulala pa ngoziyi ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibisoni**.

The text states, ""Itachitika ngoziyi a Gibson anawatengera kuchipatala komwe sadakhalitse koma anamwalira."" This directly translates to ""Gibson was taken to the hospital following the accident where he did not survive, but he died."" Therefore, Gibson was the one injured in the accident.



"
Kodi chidachitika ndi chiyani kwa anthu omwe adachita ngozi?,"The correct answer is **B: M’modzi sadavulale, m’modzi adamwalira**.

Here's why:

* The text states Itachi died in the hospital.
* The text states the 64-year-old driver was not injured in the accident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onse awiri adamwalira** - The driver did *not* die.
* **C: Adali kukuwa ndi kulira** - This describes the children who witnessed the accident, not the people *in* the accident.
* **D: Wonse awiri adavulala** - Itachi died, and the driver was uninjured.

Azasayansi amene amagwira ntchito ya pulogilamu amayembekeza kupeza zotsatira zopangitsa zoyambitsa mwa zina mwa ziti?,"The correct answer is **D: Chinthu chakuda**.

Here's why:

The passage states the research focuses on the interaction between dark matter and the Sagittarius galaxy. Specifically, it mentions the program simulates what is observed with the ""Sagittarius dwarf"" and is initiated by the ""force between dark matter."" The scientists also say dark matter affects other dark matter, and that dark matter around the halo is ""like a shell.""  Therefore, the researchers expect to find results related to dark matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chinthu chowoneka (Visible matter)**: While the Milky Way and Sagittarius are visible, the *driving force* behind the simulation is dark matter.
*   **B: Mphamvu yakukwera ndi kutsika kwa nyanja (Tidal forces)**: While tidal forces are mentioned in relation to the Moon and Earth, the primary focus is the interaction of dark matter between the galaxies.
*   **C: Tinthu ting’ono ting’ono (Tiny particles)**: Although the passage mentions ""tiny particles"" forming the shell of dark matter, the overall goal is to understand dark matter itself, not just the particles that comprise it.



"
Azasayansi amawona zinthu mwa zinthu ngati zitizo?,"The passage states that scientists observe things *through* dark matter, and that dark matter is affected by gravity like normal matter. It also mentions that dark matter around galaxies is arranged like a halo. This suggests scientists are observing things *by way of* the effects of dark matter and how it interacts with light and gravity.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Kuwala kwakulu ndi kuwala kochokera njira zambiri** (Bright light and light from many directions).  

Here's why:

*   The passage describes how dark matter's gravity bends light (""mphamvu ya mafunde pakati pa zinthu zamdima...""), affecting how we *see* things.
*   ""Kuwala kwakulu"" could refer to light from distant galaxies.
*   ""Kuwala kochokera njira zambiri"" references how the dark matter bends and distorts the light coming from those galaxies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuwala kochokera kunjira zambiri ndi mwezi** - The moon is not specifically mentioned as a key observational tool in the passage.
*   **B: Dziko ndi kuwala kwakukulu kochokera malo amodzi** - The passage focuses on galaxies and the Milky Way, not just Earth and a single bright light source.
*   **C: Dziko ndi Mwezi** - This is too simplistic. The passage describes a much more complex astronomical phenomenon.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiti chakuti sichingatsutsidwe ndi anthu osafuna kusintha kwazinthu?","The correct answer is **C: Akumupatsa ntchito yomanganso ndi ndani**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that criticisms focus on the fact that reconstruction work disproportionately favored people considered to be from Washington. This is the core of the controversy – *who* is getting the reconstruction contracts. People resistant to change (those who benefit from the existing system) would likely defend *that* aspect of the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndalama zothandizira ovutika (Funds for victims):** The passage doesn't indicate opposition to *providing* aid, but rather *how* the aid is being used and *who* is benefiting from the reconstruction.
*   **B: Kusowa kwa kumangaso (Lack of reconstruction):** The passage indicates reconstruction *is* happening, but it’s happening in a way that’s being criticized.
*   **D: Ndalama zogwiritsa ntchito kumanganso (Funds used for reconstruction):** Similar to A, the issue isn’t the funds themselves, but their allocation.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndikuti koyambilira komwe magetsi a sitima ya m’mwamba ya Stardust azawoneke?","The correct answer is **B: Kumpoto kwa Kalifoniya**.

The text states: ""Idzachoka kupita kumadzulo kwa kumpoto kwa Califonia ndipo idzawala mumlengalenga kuchokera ku California..."" This means the first place the Stardust's lights will be seen is Northern California.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi sitima ya m’mwamba izapanga mbiri pa nkhani ziti mwaizi?","The correct answer is **C: Kubwelera kudziko lapansi mwachangu kwambiri** (Returning to the country the fastest).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stardust has made a new record as the fastest aircraft to return to the country, breaking the record it set in May of 1969 during the time of the Apollo X flights."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuwalitsa dera lalikulu m’mwamba** (Illuminating a large area of sky) - While Stardust will be visible, the passage doesn't highlight illuminating a large area as a record.
*   **B: Kuwoneka m’mizinda yambiri** (Appearing in many cities) - The passage mentions the states it will be visible in, not that it's setting a record for city appearances.
*   **D: Kuyenda kuchokera ku San Francisco kupita ku Los Angeles mwachangu kwambiri** (Traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles the fastest) - This is an example *of* its speed, but not the record itself. The record is its overall return to the country speed.



"
Kodi a Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ubale wawo udali wotani ndi a Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Mwana Wamkazi**.

The text states ""thupi la Saroja Balasubramanian, azaka 53"" and ""DR. Malar Balasubramanian, azaka 29"". This indicates that Saroja was older than Malar, making Saroja the mother and Malar the daughter. Therefore, Malar is Saroja's daughter."
Kodi thupi la Sara Balasubramanian lidapezeka kuti?,"The correct answer is **C: Kumbuyo kwa galimoto** (In the trunk of the car).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Apeza thupi la Saroja Balasubramanian, azaka 53, atafunditsidwa gombeza lomwe lidali ndi magazi."" (They found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, tied up in the trunk which was bloodied.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku Cincinnati** - While Dr. Balasubramanian was *found* near Cincinnati, the body wasn't found *in* Cincinnati.
*   **B: M’mbali mwa msewu** - He was found near the road, but the body was in the trunk.
*   **D: Ku Pittsburgh** - The doctor worked in Pittsburgh, but the body was found in Ohio.



"
Kodi a eBay adagula chiyani?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states: ""Uku nkugula kwa wakukulu zedi mu mbiri ya eBay"" which translates to ""eBay is making a big purchase in history"" and then later mentions Skype. This clearly indicates eBay bought Skype.
"
Kodi eBay ikufuna kupindula chiyani pachimene agula?,"The correct answer is **B: Kufikila madera ena atsopano** (To reach new markets).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that eBay expects the purchase to shift its profit source *to areas where Skype is strong* - like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. This directly indicates their goal is to expand into new geographic markets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuyika pamodzi chuma chawo** (To consolidate their wealth) - While a positive outcome *could* result, the passage doesn't state this is the primary goal.
*   **C: Kukweza pamwamba kaonekedwe kazinthu** (To enhance the appearance of products) - This isn’t mentioned at all in the text.
*   **D: Kusangalatsa eni chuma** (To delight shareholders) - Similar to A, this might be a *result* of success, but isn't the main *purpose* of the acquisition.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ndani amene sanalumikizane ndi anthu amundende amene anatsalira pamalopo atatha kumenyedwa?","The correct answer is **D: Ogwira ntchito mchipatala**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the inmates were sent to the hospital. It does *not* say the hospital staff connected with those left behind at the jail. The passage mentions negotiators (A), firefighters (B), and wardens (C) were all involved at the jail, but not at the hospital.

Therefore, hospital staff are the only group mentioned who wouldn't have been in contact with those remaining at the jail."
Ndichiyani mwa izi zinapangitsa anthu amundende kusiya ziwawa?,"The correct answer is **B: Utsi wokhesa misozi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the warden, equipped with riot gear, *used tear gas* to subdue the inmate. Tear gas is designed to cause irritation and incapacitation, effectively stopping the violence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zokambirana zomwe zidatheka (Failed negotiations):** While negotiations happened, they *didn't* stop the violence, as the inmate started a fire.
*   **C: Akayidi anzawo wovulazidwa (Injured inmate):** The injured inmate *started* the violence, it didn't stop it.
*   **D: Moto (Fire):** The fire was the *result* of the violence, not what stopped it. It was the tear gas deployed *after* the fire started that brought things under control.



"
"Mu maganizo a Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, kodi dziko la Irani lingazipulumutse kuchiyani?","The correct answer is **D: Kudalira pa mafuta**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called reliance on oil a “trap” and that the country needs to be saved from it. This directly indicates his belief that Iran needs to escape its dependence on oil.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ziletso pachuma:** While the passage mentions economic sanctions, Khamenei's statement isn't about saving Iran *from* sanctions, but rather from relying on oil *despite* the sanctions.
*   **B: Kuukira kwa anthu kumayiko achisilamu:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Chuma chochokera kunja:** The passage discusses Iran's foreign earnings, but Khamenei's quote focuses on oil dependence, not external funding in general.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi,ndi ndani anavomereza za zotsatira za chilango pa chuma chaku Irani?","The correct answer is **A: Anthu akuluakulu odziwika**.

The passage states: ""Ndemanga zomwe zinali pa wailesi yakanema za nthawi yomweyo, ndizoyamba kuti **akuluakulu aku Iran** adavomereza kuti ziletso zomwe alinazo zikubweretsa zovuta."" 

This directly indicates that Iranian officials acknowledged the negative consequences of the sanctions.



"
Ndi chiyani mwa izi simbali imodzi ya ndondomeko ya kavotedwe ku Fulansi?,"The correct answer is **A: Mabokosi ovoteramo owonekera mkati** (Transparent ballot boxes).

Here's why:

*   **The passage specifically states:** ""Kuyambira mchaka cha 1988, mabokosi ovotera amayenera kukhala wowonekera poyera kuti ovota ndi oyang'anira athe kuchitira umboni..."" (Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Oyimilira makandideti** (Candidate representatives): While the passage mentions opponents can send observers, it doesn't describe them as a fundamental part of the voting *process* itself.
*   **C: Kusayina chipepara cha anthu ovota** (Signing the voter roll): The passage states voters sign an acknowledgement *after* voting, not as part of the initial voting process.
*   **D: Mavoti owerengedwa ndi owayimilira** (Votes counted by representatives): The passage states votes are counted by dedicated individuals *with* observers, not *by* representatives.



"
Kodi ndi pati pomwe ovota amaonetsa munthu amene amusakha?,"The correct answer is **C: Pa enivelopi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ndikuika papela lomwe anasindikizapo anthu womwe iwo akuwafuna, ndikusankha omwe akumufuna **ndikuyika mu enivelopu**."" 

This directly translates to: ""...and put a paper with the people they want to vote for, choose those they want and put them **in the envelope**.""

Therefore, voters indicate their choice on the paper and then place that paper *inside the envelope*.



"
Kodi chinapangitsa Allen kuyamba kuyang’ana Musashi zaka zisanu ndi zitatu ndi chiyani?,"The correct answer is **D: Chidwi chake pa nkhondo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""adayamba kufunafuna kuti apeze Musashi kamba ka chidwi chawo cha nthawi yaitali pa nkhondo imeneyi."" This directly translates to ""they began searching for Musashi as an extension of their long-standing interest in the war."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chuma chake (His wealth):** While his wealth *enabled* the search, it wasn't the initial *motivation*.
*   **B: Chidwi chake muzinthu zobisika za m’madzi (His interest in underwater mysteries):** The passage doesn't specify a general interest in underwater mysteries, but specifically an interest stemming from the war.
*   **C: Ntchito zake muzinthu zobisika za m’madzi (His work in underwater mysteries):** The passage mentions his investment in oceanographic research, but doesn't state this was the direct cause for looking for the Musashi.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi Allen anagwiritsa ntchito ndalama zawo zochuluka pachiyani?","Correct answer: **B: Kupeza zinthu za m’madzi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""a Allen akuti ayika chuma chawo chochuluka pa nkhani yazofufuza zamnyanja..."" which translates to ""Allen says they put their considerable fortune into the matter of marine research..."" 

This directly indicates their significant financial investment was in exploring the ocean (kupeza zinthu za m’madzi). While finding the Musashi was a specific goal, it was *part* of their broader investment in marine research.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kubwezeretsa Musashi:** This is the *result* of the research, not the investment itself.
*   **C: Kumanga ROV:** The ROV was a *tool* used in the research, not where the money was primarily spent.
*   **D: Kumphunzira za zopezeka pansi pa nyanja:** This is the outcome of the research, but the money was invested in the research *process* to achieve that learning.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chiyani mwa izi zinapangitsa zinthu zoyipa mkatimo komanso pamalo ogwilirapo ntchito?","The correct answer is **A: Mafuta a Uranium**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Adindo akuganizira kuti makontena a uranium atha kukhala kuti asweka ndipo akuchucha."" (Experts believe that uranium containers may have leaked and are melting). This directly links the potential problems to leaking uranium.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kasiyamu wa Radioactive** - While caesium *was found* at the plant, the passage suggests it's a *result* of the problem, not the *cause* of it.
*   **C: Utsi oyera** - The white smoke is a *symptom* of the problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: Ayidini** - Similar to caesium, iodine was *detected* but isn't presented as the root cause.

*   **D: Chepetsani kumwa madzi apampopi** - Akuluakulu asamwe madzi apampopi.
*   **A: Chepetsani kugwiritsa ntchito makina opeleka mpweya m'nyumba** - Akuluakulu akunenela kuti azimitse makina opeleka mpweya m'nyumba.



"
"Malingana ndi Dr. Moll, ndichiyani chokhudza kwambiri pa nkhani ya XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **B: Kachilombo katsopano kopima ku mankhwala**.

Here's why:

* **Dr. Moll explicitly states the biggest concern is the drug resistance:** He says the strain is ""extremely difficult to treat because of the drug resistance."" This directly points to the problem being the bacteria's ability to withstand medication.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kachilombo tsopano kokhazikika muzipatala:** While the hospital transmission is a concern, Dr. Moll highlights the *resistance* as the primary issue, not just where it's found.
* **C: Gulu la anthu lomwe munthu odwala angalipatsire matenda:** The number of people an infected person can infect is important for spread, but Dr. Moll focuses on the difficulty in *treating* the infection.
* **D: Chiwelengero chachikulu cha anthu omwalira:**  The fact that people are dying is a consequence of the resistance, not the core problem itself.



"
Ndi anthu odwala angati amene anatenga kachilombo kamakani katsopano ndipo anatsimikizidwa kuti anali ogwira ntchito zaumoyo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Dr. Moll, thinks two were hospital workers."" This directly answers the question about how many healthcare workers were identified as having the new, drug-resistant strain of TB.



"
Kodi ndi luso lanji lomwe ndondomeko ya NextGen imagwiritsa ntchito?,"The correct answer is **A: Maluso am’mlengangalenga** (Satellite technology).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that NextGen ""imagwiritsa ntchito ukadaulo wa setilayiti"" (uses satellite technology) as opposed to ground-radar.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Luso lolunjika** (Guidance technology) - While NextGen *provides* guidance, it doesn't define the core technology *used* by the system.
*   **C: Ukatswiri owona ndege pamakina aluso** (Expertise in viewing planes on digital devices) - This describes what a controller might *do* with the information, not the technology itself.
*   **D: Maluso otulutsa mpweya oyipa** (Harmful gas emission technologies) - This is unrelated to the description of NextGen.



"

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chifukwa chiyani anthu osunga mbiri sanatsutse pazomwe bugwe la zofufuza la FBI likuchita?","The correct answer is **C: Chidwi chachikulu pa milandi yazolaula**

Here's why:

The passage states that Congress began funding investigations into public officials' misconduct in 2005 and directed the FBI to assign ten people to investigate such allegations. This indicates a significant concern and interest in cases of official misconduct (zolaula). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kulimbikitsa gawo lopambana:** The passage doesn't mention any desire to promote a particular faction or win.
*   **B: Kupeleka zoyeneleza ku milandu imene ingatheke:** While justice is a general goal, the passage focuses on the *interest* in investigating misconduct, not necessarily ensuring justice.
*   **D: Milandu ya kubedwa magalimoto:** The passage mentions car impoundments as examples of trivial matters the FBI was criticized for handling, but it doesn't say this is why misconduct investigations were initiated.



"
Ndi chiyani choyambitsa kulawula chomwe chingapangitse bugwe lofufuza la FBI kuchitapo zinthu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ikani chidwi pa milandu yomwe siyovuta kuthana nayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that critics accused the FBI of investigating easy cases (like car thefts) *specifically to boost their statistics*. This means the FBI was motivated to focus on cases that were simple to solve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupeleka zoyeneleza zambiri ku milandu yakuba magalimoto** - The passage doesn't mention improving the quality of car theft investigations, only that they were *doing* them.
*   **B: Kulimbikitsa kupambana kwa othandizira** - The passage doesn't mention anything about informants or their success.
*   **D: Kupeleka othandizila pa milandu yokhuzana ndi zolawula** - The passage doesn't talk about focusing on regulatory crimes or using informants in those cases.



"
Kodi chinachitika ndi chiyani ku galimoto yozimitsa moto imene imakathandizira ngozi ya JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: Idagwa** (It crashed).

The text states: ""Atolankhani akonko akuti galimoto yozimitsa moto kubwalo la ndege idagudubuzika pamene imagwira ntchito.""  ""Dagudubuzika"" directly translates to ""crashed"" or ""overturned"" in this context. While it implies an accident, ""idagwa"" is the most accurate translation of the reported event.



"
"Malingana ndi ngozi ya JAS 39C Gripen, bwalo la ndege linatsekedwa kamba ka chiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Ndege zopita maiko akunja** (Flights to and from the airport).

Here's why:

The text states the crash ""caused flights to be suspended."" The other options are details *about* the crash (the fire truck, the pilot, the reporters) but don't explain *why* the airport was closed.



"
Kodi Brzezinski anapereka upangiri kwandani nthawi youkira ulamuliro wa dziko la Irani?,"The correct answer is **C: A Carter**.

The passage states: ""Nthawi yosankha chaka cha 1976 analangiza Carter pankhani zakunja, ndipo anagwira ntchito yawu National Security Advisor (NSA) kuyambira 1977 mpaka 1981...kusintha zinthu ku Irani kumene kunadzetsa vuto la anthu ogwidwa ndi adani chaka cha 1979."" This clearly indicates Brzezinski advised Carter regarding the situation in Iran.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A Kissinger:** The passage mentions Brzezinski *contrasting* with Kissinger, not advising him.
*   **B Kennedy:** Brzezinski worked *for* Kennedy, but the question asks about advice regarding Iran.
*   **D Johnson:** Brzezinski also worked for Johnson, but again the question refers to advice on Iran.



"
Kodi ndindani amene adali Mlangizi wa Chitetezo wa Dziko kufikila mchaka cha 1977?,"Yoyenera ndi **B: A Kissinger**.

M'zaka za 1960, Brzezinski anagwira ntchito kwa Kennedy ndi Johnson, koma m'mawuwa akunena kuti anayamba kulowa mosithana ndi Kissinger. Izi zikutanthauza kuti Kissinger adali Mlangizi wa Chitetezo wa Dziko kale, kufikira Brzezinski atakhala paudindo uwu mchaka cha 1977."

Zoyambirira zonse zosiyana zidafotokozera zowona za ntchito ya Bobek ndi Partizan Belgrade."
Ndi ndemanga iti mu mbiri ya a Bobeki ndi timu ya Partizan Belgrade ndiyondola?,"The correct answer is **A: Anayamba kumenya mu timu ya Partizan chaka cha 1945**.

Here's why:

* The passage states directly: ""Adalowa nawo mu chaka cha 1945 mpaka 1958"" which translates to ""He joined in 1945 until 1958"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage states he was *born* in Zagreb, but doesn't mention playing for a Zagreb team before Partizan.
* **C:** The passage says he played until 1958, not 1995. 1995 is the year he was voted the best player *in history*.
* **D:** While he *was* recognized as a great player, the statement about being chosen as the best is a consequence of his playing career, not a description of when he played.

Kodi tanthauzo la “Hesperonychus” lidachokera kuziti zowoneka za mtundu wazimenezi?,"The correct answer is **A: Zikhadabo**.

The passage states: “Chikhadabo chake chachiwiri chinali chokulirapo, chidabweletsa dzina la Hesperonychus limene limatanthauza “chikhadabo chakumadzulo”.” This directly links the name ""Hesperonychus"" to its claws."
Kodi ndi nkhani iti mwaizi yomwe ndiyowona pankhani yowomberana?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuwomberako kudachitika ku Buffalo**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states: ""...akuluakulu adatero."" and ""...adabwera ku Buffalo kukasangalala pamodzi ndi abwenzi komanso abale."" and ""...adabadwila ku Buffalo..."" which clearly indicates the shooting happened in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Abambo ndi amayi onse adali wochokera ku Tekisazi** - The passage states the family *moved* to Texas, not that they originated from there.
*   **B: Padali anthu asanu wokhuzidwa** - The passage states four people were shot, not five.
*   **C: Awiriwa adakwatirana chaka chatha ku Buffalo** - The passage states they *moved* to Texas a year ago, and were celebrating their first year together as a family. It doesn't say they got married in Buffalo."
Kodi ndi nkhani iti yowona malingana ndi zochitika kumene kudali kuwombera ku Buffalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Zidachitika pa phwando lachikumbutso ku Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Anthu osachepera 100 adakhala nawo pa phwando pokondwelera kuti banja lina latha chaka chimodzi chilowere m'banja..."" and ""...adabwera ku Buffalo kukasangalala pamodzi ndi abwenzi komanso abale."" This clearly indicates a celebratory gathering (a party) in Buffalo.
* The shooting occurred *at* this party.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zidachitika pamwambo wokumbukira chaka:** While the party *commemorates* an anniversary, it's described as a party, not a formal memorial service.
* **C: Zidachitika pa phwando ku Tekisazi:** The family *moved from* Texas to Buffalo; the party was held in Buffalo.
* **D: Zidachitika paukwati wa awiriwa:** The party was for the first anniversary of the couple *being together*, not their wedding.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi nkhawa zoyambilira za akuluakulu zokhuza Luno zidali zotani?","The correct answer is **A: Kusowa kwa katundu wa feteleza**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Oyang'anira sitimayo poyamba anali ndi mantha kuti sitimayo itha kutaya katundu wake wamasiku onse Feteleza."" This directly indicates their initial concern was losing the Feteleza cargo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mafunde ndi mphepo yayikulu:** While the storm is mentioned, the passage states the *managers'* initial concern wasn't the storm itself, but the potential loss of cargo *because* of the storm.
*   **C: Kutayika kwa mafuta:** The oil spill is mentioned as a consequence of the wreck, not the initial worry of the managers.
*   **D: Kuvulala komwe kungathe kuchitika kwa ogwira ntchito:** The passage states that all twelve workers were rescued, so injury wasn't the initial fear stated.

Kodi ndimuzaka zamakumi ati dziko la Algeria lidapeza ufulu?,"The correct answer is **C: M'zaka zam’ma 1960**.

Here's why:

The text states Zimene Vautier returned to newly independent Algeria in the 1960s to teach filmmaking. This directly implies Algeria gained its independence *in* the 1960s.



"
Kodi zowonera makanena sizidalumikizidwe kuti pa mwambo wa maliro?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku Romu konse** (Only in Rome).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Makina akulu akulu adaikidwa ku Rome kuti anthu awonere mwambo."" (Large screens were set up in Rome so people could watch the ceremony.)  It doesn't say screens were set up in other cities in Italy or Poland *for the ceremony itself*. It only says those places had similar arrangements to *watch* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kumizinda yosiyanasiyana yamu Itale** - The passage says other cities had *similar arrangements*, but not specifically screens to view the ceremony.
* **C: M’madera ena ku Poland** -  Poland also had similar arrangements to *watch* the ceremony, not necessarily screens *at* the ceremony.
* **D: Pamalo a St. Peter** - The screens were to help people *outside* of St. Peter’s Square see the ceremony, not *in* the square itself.



"
Kodi mwambo wamaliro udachitikira kuti?,"The correct answer is **C: Pamalo a St. Peter**.

The passage states that the large crowds gathered at the maliro (funeral) at St. Peter's Square. While the event was also viewed in other locations, the main event *took place* at St. Peter's.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: M’madera wosiyanasiyana aku Romu** - While people were *in* different parts of Rome, the specific location mentioned is St. Peter's Square.
*   **B: Ku Polandi** - Poland hosted viewings, but the funeral itself wasn’t there.
*   **D: Poyamba ku Rome, kenako ku mzinda wina waku Itale** - The passage doesn’t mention the funeral moving to another city in Italy.



"
"Potsatira kuphulika, kodi ndi ndani amene adathandizidwa Kamba kovulala kwambiri?","The correct answer is **A: Makamaka anthu asanu** (Specifically five people).

The text states: ""Pafupifupi anthu asanu omwe analipo pomwe kunaphulika anawathandiza chifukwa anali wozizimutsidwa."" This directly translates to ""Approximately five people who were present when it exploded were helped because they were disoriented.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Palibe wina aliyense** (No one else) - The text clearly states five people *were* helped.
*   **C: Mkulu wa kampani ya gasi** (Head of the gas company) - The text doesn't mention the head of the company being involved in the help.
*   **D: Bwenzi wakhomo lina** (Neighbor from another house) - The text specifies those helped were the ones *in* the house when it exploded.



"
Kodi amene adanena zakutayika kwa gasi ndi ndani?,"The correct answer is **A: Bwenzi wokhala naye mu nyumba yomweyo koma yosanjikana**.

The passage states: ""Wogwira ntchito pakampani ya gasi adapitaa kumaloko pamene **adawuzidwa ndiwokhala naye pafupi kuti gasi akutayika.**"" This directly translates to ""The gas company worker went there when **he was told by a neighbor that gas was leaking.**"" 

Therefore, the person who reported the gas leak was a neighbor. Option A best represents that.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi adafa anthu angati pa chiwembu chimenechi?","The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage specifically states: ""Anthu omwe adamwalira adali a Nicholas Alden, azaka 25 ndi a Zachary Cuddeback, azaka 21."" This means two people died. 

The mention of a fifth person is in relation to the car damage (""Chida cha Uka chinaonongeka atalozetsa kumutu kwa munthu wachisanu."") but doesn't indicate they died."
Kodi ndi chida Chandani chidakanika kuwombera nthawi ina yake mkati mwa chiwembuchi?,"The correct answer is **B: A Uka**.

The text states: ""Chida cha Uka chinaonongeka atalozetsa kumutu kwa munthu wachisanu."" This directly indicates that Uka's weapon malfunctioned.
"
Kodi ndimasewera ati apa womwe adavoteredwa kuti asakhale nawo pa pulogalamu ya Olempiki?,"The correct answer is **D: Karate**.

The text states: ""Masewera a squash, karate, ndi maroller adati awaike nawo pa mndandanda wa masewera a Olympic kuonjezerapo baseball ndi softball pomwe muchaka cha 2005 adawachotsa."" This means squash, karate and roller sports were *not* selected to be included in the Olympics. Of those three, karate is the only option provided.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sikwashi (Squash)** - While not selected, it isn't the direct answer to the question.
*   **B: Ragibe (Rugby)** - Rugby *was* selected.
*   **C: Mpira wa Besibo (Baseball)** - Baseball was previously removed from the Olympics and is being considered for re-inclusion, but wasn't directly voted against in this instance.



"
Kodi ndimasewera ati apa womwe a Komiti ya International Olympic adavoteredwa kuti akhale nawo mumasewera a Olempiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Masewera a Ragibe okhala ndi osewera 15 mbali zonse** (Rugby with 15 players per side).

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically states ""Rugby... was selected from five sports to compete at the Games."" It refers to the traditional 15-a-side rugby.
*   Golf is also mentioned, but rugby is the most direct answer to the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Masewera a Rola** (Roller sports) - The passage states roller sports *applied* to be included, but weren't selected.
*   **B: Mpira wa Besibo** (Baseball) - Baseball was *previously* removed from the Olympics.
*   **D: Masewera a Sofutibo** (Softball) - Softball was *previously* removed from the Olympics.



"
Kodi a Arthur Guinness poyambilira adabwereketsa kampani yopanga mowa ya St James’s Gate kwa zaka zingati?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The text states that Arthur Guinness signed a lease for **9,000** years for the St James Gate brewery.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 250** - This refers to the number of years Guinness has been a global business, not the original lease length.
*   **B: 10** - This number doesn’t appear in the text in relation to the lease.
*   **C: 1759** - This is the year the lease was signed, not the lease length.



"
Kodi a Guinness amabweletsa mabiliyoni angati pa chaka potengera ndalama yakwa Amerika?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The passage states that Guinness generates approximately $10 billion annually."
Kodi ndi m’mayiko angati amgwirizano waku Ulaya komwe kachirombo ka vayilasi kotchedwa H5N1 kadapezeka?,"The correct answer is **C: Anasu ndi awiri** (Twelve).

Here's why:

The passage states that France is the *twelfth* EU country to detect the H5N1 virus, following Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy.  That makes a total of seven countries explicitly listed *plus* France, equaling twelve.



"
Kodi kachirombo ka H5N1 kadapezeka kuti chapompano?,"The correct answer is **A: Fulansi**.

The passage states: ""France is the fifth country in the European Union to detect the virus; following Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy."" This means France is the latest country to confirm a case of H5N1.



"
Kodi dziko la Haiti lidali ndi matenda amenewa komaliza ndiliti asadapatsiridwe matendawa ndi asilikali wosungitsa mtendere?,"The correct answer is **A: Muzaka zam’ma 1800**.

The text states: ""Pamene asilikali adali asadafikeko ku Haiti, sadakomanepo ndi mavuto okhuzana ndi matendawa kuchokera mu zaka za m'ma 1800."" This directly answers the question, indicating Haiti hadn't experienced these diseases since the 1800s before the peacekeeping soldiers arrived.



"
Kodi ndi zonyasa zochokera dera liti zomwe zidathandizira kufalitsa matendawa?,"The correct answer is **B: Zochokera ku msasa wa bungwe la UN**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states that ""zinyalala zochokera ku msasa wa UN sizinathiridwe bwino mankhwala kupangitsa ma bacteria kuti alowe mu mtsinje wothira mu Artibonite."" This directly links the waste from the UN base as the source of the contamination that spread the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zamumtsinje wa Artibonite** - The Artibonite River *received* the contamination, it didn't *cause* it.
*   **C: Malo omwe kudachitikira chivomerezi mu 2010** - The earthquake was the reason the UN peacekeepers were sent to Haiti, but it wasn't the direct source of the cholera.
*   **D: Bungwe laza Chilungamo komanso la Ndale Zokomera onse laku Haiti lotchedwa Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy** - This is an organization investigating the issue, not the source of the contamination.



"
Kodi boma laku Ireland likukonzekera kuchita chiyani?,"The correct answer is **C: Kukhwefulako malamulo pachilolezo cha mankhwala ozunguza bongo** (To revise laws regarding drug licensing).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The government acknowledges that existing laws were flawed and *have been revised* (corrected). The Minister of Health is concerned about the impact of these flawed laws on people's health.
* **This indicates a plan to further improve/revise the laws**, not just punish offenders (A), create harsher laws (B), or stop prosecutions altogether (D). The focus is on getting the *legislation right* so it doesn't negatively affect public health.



"
Kodi nchiyani chomwe chidali chololedwa m'malamulo kwakanthawi m'dziko la Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Mankhwala ozunguza bongo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Minister of Health was concerned about people's health due to ""the limited access the law afforded to controlled medicines and penalties relating to drugs"" and that the laws were found to be flawed and amended. This directly indicates that the laws concerned drugs (specifically, controlled/potentially harmful drugs) and that there was a problem with access and penalties related to them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuba ndi kuthyola mnyumba (Theft and burglary):** The passage does not mention anything about these crimes.
*   **B: Utambwali (Rape):** The passage doesn't address this issue.
*   **C: Kupwetekana (Assault):** The passage doesn't address this issue.



"
Kodi omuganizira kuphwanya malamulo akumufufuza pa mlandu wotani?,"The correct answer is **A: Kudutsa malo a eni popanda chilolezo**.

The passage clearly states that Christopher Garcia is being investigated for trespassing on someone's property without permission. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kuwononga zinthu** - The sign wasn't damaged, only altered.
* **C: Kuwononga katundu** - There's no mention of damaging goods.
* **D: Kuba** - There's no mention of theft.



"
"Pamene amasintha chikwangwani, kodi woganizilidwayo nchiyani chomwe sanachite?","The correct answer is **C: Kuphwanya**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Chizindikirocho sichidaphwanyidwe chidangosinthidwa zolemba"" which translates to ""The sign was not broken, only the letters were changed."" This directly means the suspect *did not* vandalize (break) the sign.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kusintha zina mwazilembo zake** - The text says the letters *were* changed (""chidangosinthidwa zolemba"").
*   **B: Kukongoletsa ndi chikwangwani cha mtendere** - The text states the suspect used a black marker with peace and heart symbols (""masaka akuda wokongoletsa ndi zizindikiro zamtendere ndi mtima"").
*   **D: Kugwiritsa ntchito nsalu yatenti pochisintha** - The text mentions a marker, not fabric paint (""masaka akuda"").



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi mziti mwaizi zomwe mphunzitsi wa Chingerezi a Karno sadazenge nacho mlandu?","The correct answer is **A: Kuphwanya malamulo aluso la anzawo (Infringing on the professional rights of others)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states Karno was accused of ""taking the work of others without permission"" (kuphwanya lamulo potenga ntchito ya anthu ena popanda chilolezo) but **was not prosecuted** (sanaimbidwe mlandu). This means he wasn't charged with any legal wrongdoing related to that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kukhala pa ubwenzi ndi wophunzira (Having a relationship with a student):** The passage explicitly states he ""taught the skill of cheating on relationships in writings"" (anaphunzitsa luso lokhalira pa ubwenzi muzolemba), implying involvement in students’ romantic lives.
*   **C: Kusindikiza mauthenga amalonda popanda chilolezo (Printing advertisements without permission):** He was fired for ""printing large advertisements on buses without permission"" (chotsindikiza malembo akuluakulu mumabasi popanda chilolezo).
*   **D: Kugwiritsa ntchito mawu otukwana mukalasi (Using abusive language in class):** The passage states he ""used abusive language in class"" (akutiso amatukwana mkalasi).



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi amene sadagwidwe ukapolo ndi Rolando Mendoza ndi ndani?","The correct answer is **D: Wojambula zinthunzi**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Wojambula zithunzi aku Philippines...adamasulidwa nsanga chimodzimodziso wojambula zithunzi aku Philippines."" This directly states the photographer was released and therefore wasn't held hostage by Rolando Mendoza.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alendo** - The text clearly states ""Womwe adagwidwa ukapolo angapo apulumutsidwa"" meaning the tourists *were* taken hostage.
*   **B: Apolisi** - The text states ""Wapolisi wakale waku Phillipines wagwira ukapolo alendo"" meaning the police *took* the hostages, they weren't hostages themselves.
*   **C: Ana** - The text says ""Anthu asanu ndi m'modzi omwe adagwida ukapolo kuphatikizapo ana"" meaning children *were* among those taken hostage.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndiwogwidwa ukapolo ati omwe zidatsimikizidwa kuti sadatulutsidwa msanga?","The correct answer is **A: Alendo**.

The passage states: ""Womwe adagwidwa ukapolo angapo apulumutsidwa ndipo pakadali pano osaposera asanu ndi m'modzi amwalira."" This refers to the hostages (alendo) taken on the bus. The passage also specifically says the photographer and the hostages were released, but doesn't mention the fate of all hostages being immediately released, rather that some died while still held captive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wokalamba** - The passage only mentions a senior citizen taking the place of a hostage, not being a hostage themselves.
*   **C: Wojambula** - The photographer was released immediately.
*   **D: Ana** - While children were among the hostages, the passage doesn’t say whether *all* of them were released immediately. The statement about the five who died applies to all hostages, including children.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndindani amene akutolela zosayinira za anthu omwe akupereka nyonga pofuna kuthetsa kukhala mlandu kwa anthu omwe akufuna kukwatirana azibambo okhaokha kapena azimayi okhaokha ku Bulazilu?","The correct answer is **A: Wochita ziwonetsero** (Protesters).

The passage states: ""Ochita ziwonetsero ali ndiyembekezo kuti atolera zosayinira zokwana 1.2 miliyoni kuti akapereke ku National Congress mu Novembala."" This directly indicates that protesters are collecting signatures to present to the National Congress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** The passage says the bill is *currently* in his hands, meaning he's handling the legislation, not collecting signatures.
*   **C: Mpingo wa Katolika:** The passage mentions the Catholic Church *opposes* same-sex marriage, but doesn't state they are collecting signatures.
*   **D: Marta Suplicy:** She *authored* the original bill, but isn’t the one currently collecting signatures.



"
Kodi wochita ziwonetsero akapereka chikalata chawo kwandani?,"The correct answer is **C: Kongiresi ya dziko lonse la Bulazilu**.

The text states the protestors hope to deliver 1.2 million signatures to the National Congress in November."
"Malingana ndikunena kwa Armand Versace, kodi chidachitika ndichiyani gulu la anthu lisadayambe kupanga za nyengoyi?","The correct answer is **A: Kudayamba kugwa matalala (The start of the hailstones falling)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kenako matalala adagwa kuchokera kumwamba, anthu adatanganidwa komaso kukuwa ndi kugundanagundana pothamanaga."" (Then hailstones fell from the sky, people were confused and also crying and bumping into each other while fleeing).

Armand Versace's quote describes people jumping over and pushing two men on stilts *after* the chaos began. This implies the hailstones were already falling and people were panicking *before* the situation with the men on stilts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chiwonetsero chidachedwa ndi mphindi zisanu (The show was delayed by five minutes):** This refers to the beginning of the demonstration, not what happened before the panic.
*   **C: Kudali mphepo zamkutho (There were strong winds):** While winds were present, they happened *before* the hailstones and the described panic.
*   **D: Adalephera kulondola zam’bale wam’banja (He failed to locate his family members):** This is what Armand Versace *says he did*, not something that happened to the group beforehand.



"
"Malingana ndi Versace, kodi mphepo zamkuntho zidayamba liti?","The correct answer is **A: Patapita mphindu zochepa pamene chiwonetsero chitayamba**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mkati mwa mphindi zisanu zachionetsero mphepo yayamba kulowa..."" which translates to ""Within the first five minutes of the show, the wind began to blow..."" This directly answers the question of when the winds started.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pamene mvula idatha** - The text states rain *followed* the wind, not the other way around.
* **C: Pamene adataya mlongo wake** - Losing his dog is a consequence of the storm, not when it began.
* **D: Isadayambe mvula yamatalala** - The wind started *before* the hail (matalala) fell.



"
"Fred isadabwere, kodi ndi anamondwe angati omwe adadziwika kukhala mkaundula chakum’mawa wa 35°W?","The correct answer is **A: Palibe (None)**.

Here's why:

The text states Fred is the *third* storm to reach that intensity (105 mph/165 km/h) in the Cape Verde region and the Atlantic, but specifically mentions it's a phenomenon *never before seen* in the eastern and western Atlantic. It also states Fred is located west of 35°W. The question asks how many storms *before Fred* were identified *east* of 35°W. Since Fred is the third *overall* and the first of its kind in those regions, and we're looking for storms *east* of its position, the answer is none.
"
"Pamene Fred adali pafupi ndi zilumba za Cape Verde, kodi adali akulowela mbali iti?","The correct answer is **D: Kumpoto chakumadzulo**.

Here's why:

The text states Fred is moving ""chakumpoto waku zambwe"" which translates to ""northwest."" This directly indicates the direction Fred was heading.
"
Kodi ndiziti mwaizi zomwe zimathamanga kwambiri kusiyana ndi zam’mbuyomu?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Changu cha 802.11n ndichochuluka kwambiri kusiyana ndi chazomwe chinasinthana nazo, ichi changu chake chimatha kufikira 600Mbit/s."" This directly confirms 802.11n is the fastest."
Kodi chofunikira ndi chiyani kuti 802.11n ithe kugwirizana ndi zakale monga 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma rediyo awiri**.

Here's why:

The text states that 802.11n can be *backwards compatible* with 802.11a/b/g **if the station has dual radios**. This means the device needs separate hardware to communicate on both the 2.4 GHz (for b/g/n) and 5.0 GHz (for a/n) frequencies to handle the different standards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makamaka kuthamanga kwambiri** - While 802.11n *has* higher speeds, that's not what enables backwards compatibility. It would need to slow down to communicate with older standards.
*   **B: Kuthekera kwa 802.11b kugwira ntchito pa 5.0Ghz** - 802.11b only operates on 2.4 GHz.
*   **C: Kuperela mauthenga pothamanga kufikira 600Mbit/s** - Reducing speed is a consequence of backwards compatibility, not a requirement *for* it.



"
Kodi zidali zochitika zingati zomwe yemwe adapambana golide ku Olempiki amayenera kuti asambire pa masewero amayiko onse omwe adali paulamuliro wa angerezi?,"The correct answer is **B: Atatu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Olympic gold medalist needs to swim:

1.  100 meters freestyle
2.  200 meters freestyle
3.  Three events at the Commonwealth Games.

That totals to three swimming events (100m, 200m, and the three at Commonwealth Games).
"
Kodi nchifukwa chiyani amene adapambana golide ku Olempiki samamwa mankhwala kuti athetse ululu wake?,"Yoyenera ndiyo **D: Sizololedwa pamasewera amayiko onse omwe adali paulamuliro wa angerezi.**

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi chingakhale chiyani chomwe chidazunguza pa zochitika za chivomelezi?","The correct answer is **A: Kupezeka kwa mitambo yakuda** (The presence of dark tremors).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mitambo yakuda imene siyimagwilizana ndi volcano iliyonse inalengezedwa m'musi mwa phiri. Mitambo inapereka kuthekera kwa chisokonezo kuti mwina ngati kuphulika kwenikweni kunachitika."" This directly indicates the dark tremors are what caused concern and investigation into the possibility of volcanic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Malipoti wochokera Ofesi yowona zanyengo ku Ayisilandi** (Reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office) - While they *reported* no tremors, they didn't *cause* the concern.  They were reacting to the situation.
* **C: Mapu adziko lonse a chivomelezi** (Global seismic maps) - These maps showed no activity, highlighting the *lack* of confirmation, not the cause of concern.
* **D: Lipoti yazochitika kumadera ena a Ayisilandi** (Reports of events in other areas of Iceland) - The passage doesn’t mention any reports from other areas causing concern.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi kusintha kwa chigawo kudachitika liti?","The correct answer is **C: Pa 10 Marichi**.

The passage states: ""Chivomerezi chachikulu chomwe chachititsa kusintha mchigawo chidachitika pa 10 Marichi kumpoto cham'mawa pamwamba pamalo pamachitika volcano.""  This directly answers the question.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pasadafike pa 10 Marichi** - The passage states *on* March 10th, not before.
* **B: Maola 48 apitawa** - This refers to a lack of seismic activity, not the initial change in the area.
* **D: Sabata yatha** -  The passage mentions the USGS didn't detect activity *in the last week*, but the change itself happened on March 10th."
Kodi ndi nkhani iti mwaizi yokhuza roboti yopita kumwezi ya Chandrayaan-1 siyowana?,"Yoyenera ndiyo **A: Obita yomwe idatumiza roboti idali ndi anthu**.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi njira iti yoteteza kumatenda imene izakhazikitsidwe kumapeto?","The correct answer is **C: Katemera wa Ensafalitisi**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Boma lalonjeza mamiliyoni ambiri amabotolo akatemera wa encephalitis, zomwe zithandize kuti mabungwe azaumoyo akonzekere chaka chamawa."" This directly translates to ""The government has promised millions of bottles of encephalitis vaccine to help health organizations prepare for next year.""  This indicates the government is planning to use the encephalitis vaccine as a preventative measure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mankhwala ophera tizilombo (Antibiotics):** The passage doesn't mention antibiotics.
*   **B: Ogwira nkhumba (Pig handlers):** While pigs are *involved* in spreading the disease, controlling handlers isn't presented as a preventative *method* being implemented.
*   **D: Makatani a udzudzu (Mosquito nets):** Mosquito nets are mentioned as being *distributed*, but the passage focuses on the vaccine as the major future preventative action.



"
Kodi matenda amenewa amapita bwanji kwa anthu?,"The correct answer is **C: Nkhumba**.

The passage states: ""Matendawa akumatengedwa ndi nkhumba zimene zikumapatsira anthu podzera ku udzudzu."" This translates to ""The disease is transmitted by pigs which give it to people through ticks."" 

Therefore, pigs are the vector for the disease transmission. While ticks are involved, they are the *method* of transmission *by* the pigs, not the source of the disease itself.



"
Kodi kulephereka kwa chigamulo chachiwiri kutha kubweretsa zotsatira zotani?,"The correct answer is **B: Mtsogolomu kukhala ndi ufulu wokwatirana azibambo okhaokha kapena azimayi wokhawokha**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the failure of the second resolution ""could open the door for same-sex couples to marry in the future."" This directly corresponds to option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kuwunikanso pompopompo za HJR-3** - While HJR-3 *will* be reviewed later, that's a consequence of the situation, not the direct result of the resolution's failure.
*   **C: Kukhala mkumano wadzidzi wamalamulo** - The text doesn't mention any special legislative session.
*   **D: Kuletsa kukwatirana azibambo okhaokha kapena azimayi wokhawokha** - The failure of the resolution removes a barrier to *allowing* same-sex marriage, not prohibiting it.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi chigamulo chachiwiri chidachoka liti?","The correct answer is **C: Lolemba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...chidavomerezedwa munjira yake yomweyo ndi Senate **patsiku Lolemba**."" This directly answers the question of *when* the second resolution was defeated (or passed in this case, but the question asks when it happened).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Panthawi ya mkumano wazamalamulo** - This is too broad. While it *was* during a legislative session, the passage provides a more specific time.
*   **B: Mu 2011** - The passage says the amendment *passed* the houses in 2011, but doesn't say when the second resolution was removed.
*   **D: Mu 2015** - This is when it might be *reviewed* again, not when it was initially defeated.



"
Kodi “Panama Papers” adawululika kwa ndani?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwa atolankhani**.

The text states: “...yomwe idatulutsidwa **mosayenera kwa atolankhani** nthawi yachilimwe mchaka cha 2016.” (which were improperly leaked to **journalists** in the summer of 2016).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kampani ya Mossack Fonseca:** The papers *came from* this company, but they weren't revealed *to* the company.
*   **C: Ku Banki ya Jeremani:** Deutsche Bank was involved *in* the activities revealed by the papers, but the papers weren't released to them.
*   **D: Ku atsogoleri aboma la Ayisilandi:** Leaders in Iceland were affected by the revelations, but they weren't the initial recipients of the papers.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi atolankhani angerezi amati ndi ndani amene amawonelera makampani ambirimbiri omwe amabisa chuma?","The correct answer is **C: Ku Banki ya Jeremani (Deutsche Bank)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nyuzipepala ya ku Britain yotchedwa the Guardina yati Deutsche bank imalamulira pafupifupi gawo limodzi mwa atatu la ma kampani mazana khumi ndi awiri a shell kuti izi zitheke."" This directly states that the British newspaper, The Guardian, reports Deutsche Bank oversees a large portion of the shell companies used for hiding wealth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makasitomala wolemera amabanki wosiyanasiyana (Various wealthy bank customers):** While the wealthy are *using* the shell companies, they aren't the ones overseeing them according to the passage.
*   **B: Kampani yazamalamulo yaku Panama (Panama law firm):** Mossack Fonseca created the companies, but the passage states Deutsche Bank *oversees* many of them.
*   **D: Boma la Pakisitani (Pakistani government):** The passage mentions a Pakistani leader resigning, but doesn't say the government oversees the shell companies.



"
Kodi ndi ngozi ziti mwaizi za ndege zomwe zidali ndi omwalira ambiri?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngozi yandege yomwe imapita ku Irani kuchokera ku Ameniya**.

The passage states: ""Mwezi watha dziko la Iran lidaona ngozi yowopsa yandege patapita zaka pamene ndege yomwe imapita ku Armenia idagwa ndikupha anthu okwana 168 omwe adali mundegemo."" This directly states that the flight *to* Armenia from Iran had the most fatalities (168 people).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngozi yandege yomwe imapita ku Ameniya kuchokera ku Irani** - Incorrect wording, it should be ""from Iran to Armenia"".
*   **B: Ngozi ya helokoputa ya polisi** - The helicopter crash killed 3 people, which is fewer than 168.
*   **D: Ngozi yandege yomwe idachitika ku Mashidadi** - The crash in Mashhad killed 17 people, fewer than 168.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the report *opposes* almost everything in the current Executive's approach and *advocates* for a change in course. This directly contradicts the idea that things can remain the same and violence can be avoided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kudzudzula ndondomeko zatsopano** - The passage says the report ""strongly criticizes almost everything in the current Executive's approach,"" which is a form of criticism.
*   **C: Kuwunikira poteteza malire adziko la Iraki** - The passage mentions a recommendation to secure Iraq's borders.
*   **D: Pempho logwirizana ndi US** - The passage states the report ""began with a plea for open discussions and a consensus-building with the United States.""



"
Kodi ndi chiti mwaizi chomwe sichinalimbikitsidwe mu lipoti la Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **C: Kugwiritsa ntchito njira ya msuso wapoyerayera**.

Here's why:

The text states the report *opposes* almost everything in the current Executive branch's approach and *advocates for a change of course*.  It specifically mentions:

*   **A:** Establishing a guarantee to prevent sectarian violence (mentioned as wanting to stop the increase of violence)
*   **B:** A shift in the approach to the situation (advocating for a change of course)
*   **D:** Initiating diplomatic initiatives (specifically mentions initiating a diplomatic initiative with the US regarding Middle East affairs and establishing diplomatic relations with surrounding countries)

The text doesn't mention anything about using a ""flexible military approach"" (msuso wapoyerayera). In fact, the overall tone suggests a move *away* from heavy-handed military intervention and *towards* diplomatic solutions.

"Malingana ndi apolosi, kodi adali ndani amene amamuganizira kuti adali munthu wodalilika wa a Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: A Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Apolisi adati a Lo Piccolo adali patsogolo chifukwa adakhala omuthandizira Provenzano ku Palermo..."" This directly translates to ""Police said Lo Piccolo was at the forefront because he had become a collaborator of Provenzano in Palermo..."" 

Therefore, according to the police, Lo Piccolo was considered a trusted figure of Provenzano.



"
"Kutengera ndi zomwe mwapatsidwa pa ndimeyi, kodi chidachititsa kuti a Falcone amwalire ndi chiyani?","The correct answer is **A: Adaphedwa pa nthawi ya nkhondo yaku Riina**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the violence against Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino happened when Totò Riina started a war against the state. This indicates Falcone's death was a result of the conflict initiated by Riina, not by the police, Lo Piccolo, or Borsellino himself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Adaphedwa ndi apolisi** - The passage does not suggest police involvement in Falcone's death.
*   **C: A Lo Piccolo adamalulidwa kuti amuphe** - The passage mentions Lo Piccolo's support for Provenzano *after* the events surrounding Falcone and Borsellino. It does not implicate him in their murders.
*   **D: Adaphedwa ndi nzake wachifwamba otchedwa a Paolo Borsellino** - The passage presents Falcone and Borsellino as victims of the same conflict, not as perpetrators against each other."
Kodi ndi chiti mwaizi chomwe a Hitoshi Saito sadalandire nacho ulemu?,"The correct answer is **A: Katswiri kawiri konse wa dziko lonse lapansi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Saito was a ""katswiri wakale wa Olimpiki ndi Wadziko Lonse Lapansi"" (former Olympic and World Champion). It doesn't say he was a *two-time* World Champion. He was a two-time Olympic gold medalist (C) and held the position of chairman (B). He was also clearly a Judo expert (D). However, the text only confirms he was a World Champion once, not twice."
Kodi kudali kuti komwe a Iwasaki adakwanitsa kusatenga malonjezano?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepali**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states that Iwasaki ""escaped a marriage in Nepal."" This indicates Nepal is where he avoided fulfilling a commitment (the marriage). The other options are locations where he *experienced* difficulties, but not where he actively avoided an obligation."
Kodi adampanga upandu Iwasaki ndi ndani?,"Chiyankhulo chachiyambi chikunena kuti Iwasaki anakhala ndi mavuto ambiri pa ulendo wake. M’mawu amenewa, anaumidwa ku Tibet ndi galu wachiwewe, ndipo anathawa ukwati ku Nepal.

Malinga ndi chiyankhulo chachiyambi, amene adampanga upandu Iwasaki ndi **A: Amene amafuna kukwatirana naye**. Izi zikuchokera ku ukwati womwe anathawa ku Nepal.

Chifukwa chake, yankho lolondola ndi **A**."
Kodi Alonso adamaliza nthawi yanji mpikisano wake?,"Correct answer: **A: Pambuyo pa a Shumaka atawononga teyala lawo lakutsogolo**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Fernando Alonso anali patsogolo pa nthawi yambiri pampikisanowo koma zinatha bwino atayima pa malo osinthila zinthu chifukwa cha teyala lakutsogolo limene silinayikidwe bwino."" This means Alonso finished *after* Schumacher had an issue with his tires.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: A Fisichella adakanika kuwongolera galimoto lawo** - This is about Fisichella, not Alonso.
*   **C: Pambuyo pa a Shumaka atamaliza mpikisano wawo** -  While Alonso finished after Schumacher had trouble, it doesn't specify he finished *after* Schumacher completely finished the race.
*   **D: Asanatsogole** - Alonso *was* leading for much of the race, so this is incorrect as it refers to his position before the tire issue."
Kodi chidachititsa nchiyani kuti a Shumaka amalizitse mpikisano wawo mwansanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuwonongeka kwa teyala komwe adachititsa ndi a Fisichella**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""A Michael Schumacher adamaliza mpikisano wake mosasiyana kwambiri ndi Alonso, chifukwa cha kuwonongedwa kwa zogwira mateyala mu nkulimbana kwawo kwambiri pampikisano."" This directly explains Schumacher's early exit was due to tire damage sustained during a struggle with Fisichella.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Adakanika kuwongolera galimoto yawo** - The passage doesn't mention anything about Schumacher failing to control his car.
*   **B: Adagundana ndi Alonso** - While they were racing, the passage states Schumacher's issue was tire damage, not a collision with Alonso.
*   **D: Kuwonongeka kwa sasipeshoni ya galimoto** - The passage doesn't mention any suspension damage."
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi ndi ntchito yandani yopereka belo kwa omangidwa?","The correct answer is **A: Munthu omanga anthu** (The person who arrests someone).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Munthu amene adapatsidwa mphamvu amapereka belo, ngati yapelekedwa, ndipo amakhazikitsa ndondomeko ya milandu imene yayikidwa pamodzi ndi wapolisi amene anakamanga munthu."" This directly translates to: ""The person authorized gives bail, if granted, and establishes the prosecution plan along with the police who arrested the person.""

Therefore, the person authorized to give bail is the one who made the arrest – the arresting officer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Woweluza milandu a Glynn:** Glyn is a lawyer who *petitioned* the courts, they don't grant bail.
*   **C: Malo otchedwa Central Booking:** Central Booking is a facility, not a person who grants bail.
*   **D: Mkulu wamabwalo a milandu:** The passage states a judge issues a ruling, but doesn’t mention that the judge gives bail. The person with the authority to give bail does so *if* granted by the court.



"
"Malingana ndi chiletso chosakhazikika chomwe chakambidwa mu ndimeyi, kodi nchiyani chomwe womangidwa angaloledwe kukhala nacho kuti asungidwe kopitilira maola 24?","The correct answer is **A: Belo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Munthu amene adapatsidwa mphamvu amapereka belo, ngati yapelekedwa, ndipo amakhazikitsa ndondomeko ya milandu imene yayikidwa pamodzi ndi wapolisi amene anakamanga munthu.""  This means that if bail is set *and paid*, the individual can be held for longer than 24 hours. The passage links bail to the ability to continue holding someone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nkumano ndi munthu omanga anthu (A meeting with the arresting officer):** While a meeting with the arresting officer happens as part of the process, it doesn’t allow for detention beyond 24 hours.
*   **C: Milandu yomwe idaweluzidwa ndi woweluza milandu a Glynn (Charges filed by prosecutor Glynn):**  The filing of charges is *part* of the process needed to legally hold someone, but the passage focuses on bail as the key factor allowing detention past the 24-hour limit.
*   **D: Kumva mulandu (A hearing):** A hearing is the start of the legal process, but doesn’t automatically allow for continued detention, and the passage emphasizes a faster right to a hearing is being sought.



"
"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi chifukwa chiti chomwe chinalepheletsa chisankho chachibweleza?","The correct answer is **A: Ziopsezo cha chitetezo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the government officials chose to cancel the rerun election ""to save money **and also the security risk** that could come with another election."" While other factors are mentioned, the security risk is directly cited as a reason for the cancellation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chotsutsana ndi lamulo lalikulu la mudziko:** The passage states there were conflicting interpretations of the constitution - initial reports said delaying the vote was illegal, but officials found ambiguity suggesting it wasn't necessary. It's not a simple case of being *against* the constitution.
*   **C: Zokwera mtengo:** Cost saving is mentioned *alongside* security, not as the primary reason.
*   **D: kusanveka bwino kwa lamulo lalikulu la mudziko:** While ambiguity in the constitution is mentioned, it’s presented as a justification *found* by officials, not the initial reason for cancelling the election.



"
Ndi chifukwa chani chisankho cha chibweleza chinali chosafunikila malingana ndi a kazembe a dziko?,"The correct answer is **C: panali kusanvetsetseka bwino kwa lamulo lalikulu la dziko**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ambassador ""found ambiguities in Afghanistan's grand laws stating that repeat elections were not required."" This directly translates to a lack of clarity or an ambiguity in the country's laws, making the election seemingly unnecessary according to the ambassador.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Zinali zotsutsana ndi la lamulo lalikulu la dziko** - The text doesn't say it *contradicted* the law, but that there were ambiguities *within* it.
*   **B: Panali chiopsezo pa chitetezo** - While security was a reason given by officials to *cancel* the election, it wasn't the ambassador's reason for finding it unnecessary.
*   **D: Chisankho cha chibweleza chinali cholowetsa ndalama zambiri** - The passage mentions saving money as a reason for the government, not the ambassador's reasoning.



"
Ndi ndani amene amathandizila madongosolo oweluza ndi kayendetsedwe ka milandu ku FATA?,"The correct answer is **A: Boma la Pakistani**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""atsogoleri a Pakistani akhala akusankha “oimilira a ndale” kuti azilamulira FATA"" and these political agents operate under ""Lamulo nambala 247 lamumalamulo akulu adziko la Pakistani."" This clearly indicates the Pakistani government is ultimately responsible for the administration and judicial proceedings in FATA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Akazitape a ndale** - While the political agents are involved, they are *chosen by* the Pakistani leadership and operate under Pakistani law, not independently.
* **C: Mtsogoleli wa dziko la Pakistani** - The leader appoints the agents, but the *government* as a whole implements the system.
* **D: Boma la British** - Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947; Britain no longer has authority there.



"
Ndi mfundo iti ya a kazitape a ndale a FATA yomwe siyowona?,"The correct answer is **A: Amathandiza ntchito zoona madosongolo oweruza ndi kayendetsedwe ka milandu.**

Here's why:

The passage states Political Agents *conduct* governmental and judicial work *according to* Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR) - Law No. 247. They don't *assist* judges or the conduct of trials. They *are* the ones conducting it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: Anasankhidwa ndi mtsogoleri wa dziko la Pakistani:** The passage clearly states they are *chosen* by Pakistani leaders.
*   **C: Amatsatila lamulo lalikulu ladziko la Pakistan:** They operate under Law No. 247, which is part of Pakistan's legal framework.
*   **D: Amalamulira kwa thunthu muzithu zina:** The passage describes them as having significant power in governing the areas.



"
Ndi gawo la mphoto liti lomwe a Emma Stone anasankhidwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mkazi ochita bwino zisudzo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gosling ndi Stone analandira zinsankho za mwamuna wochita bwino zitsuzo komanso mkazi ochita bwino zitsuzo motsatana."" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress in leading roles respectively.""
"
Ndi mphoto iti yomwe filimuyi sinasankhidwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Okonza za maonekedwe abwino kwambiri azithu**.

Here's why:

The text lists the following nominations:

*   Best Actor & Actress (Gosling & Stone)
*   Best Picture
*   Directing
*   Screenplay
*   Costume Design
*   Film Editing
*   Original Song (x2)
*   Production Design
*   Sound Editing
*   Sound Mixing
*   Visual Effects

It **does not** mention a nomination for ""Best Makeup and Hairstyling"" (Okonza za maonekedwe abwino kwambiri azithu).

Therefore, that is the award the film was not nominated for."
Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zinapitilira kugwira ntchito chitatha chivomelezi?,"The correct answer is **D: Makina opangila magetsi ku Niigata**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata was ""operating normally"" after the earthquake. This means the power generation facilities in Niigata continued to function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makina onse amene anaikidwa ku fakitole ya Hokuriku Shika:** The text specifically says Hokuriku Electric Power Company announced they were *not* affected, and units 1 & 2 were *not* shut down - it doesn’t say all machines were operating normally.
*   **B: Bwalo la ndege la Ishikawa:** The text explicitly states the Noto Airport in Ishikawa is *closed*.
*   **C: Ntchito zonse za njanji:** The text says train services were *disrupted*.



"
"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe zinawonongeka chifukwa cha chivomelezi?","The correct answer is **C: Misewu ina**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Misewu ina yawonongedwa, maulendo anjanjinso asokonekera, ndipo bwalo la ndege la Noto ku Ishikawa ylikadali lotseka."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nyumba zina:** The passage mentions nearly 9,400 households are without water and over 100 are without power, but doesn't say homes were *damaged*.
*   **B: Makina a wiri ku Shika:** The passage states Hokuriku Electric Power Company's units 1 and 2 were *not* affected and *not* shut down.
*   **D: Bwalo la ndege la Noto:** While the airport *is* closed, the question asks what was *damaged* by the earthquake, and being closed doesn't necessarily mean it sustained damage. The passage says roads were damaged.

"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi mavuto ati mwaotsatilawa omwe sanaikidwe muzolembedwa?","The correct answer is **B: Chomwe Chinayambitsa nkhondo ya chaka cha 1967**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage focuses on the *consequences* of the 1967 war (border disputes) and current negotiations regarding borders, Jerusalem, and the Jordan Valley.** It *mentions* the war, but doesn't explain *what caused* it.
*   **A: Tsogolo la Yerusalemu (The future of Jerusalem)** - This *is* discussed in the passage.
*   **C: kupezeka kwa asilikali a nkhondo muchigwa (Presence of soldiers in the Jordan Valley)** - This *is* a key point of contention mentioned in the passage (Israel wants 10 years, PA wants 5).
*   **D: Nkangano wa malile a dziko (Border disputes)** - This is the central topic of the passage.

Therefore, the only issue *not* addressed in the text is the cause of the 1967 war."

"
Ndi dziko liti limene a Ma anaphunzila za malamulo?,"The correct answer is **A: Dziko la Amelika**.

The passage states that Ma studied at Harvard Law School, which is in the United States of America. Therefore, he studied law in the United States."

"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ndani amene a Carolyn Wilson anawagwirirako ntchito asanachoke kutawuni?","The correct answer is **C: A OHA**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Carolyn Wilson *of OHA* had embezzled their security deposits..."" This directly links Carolyn Wilson to OHA (presumably a housing authority) and indicates she was working *with* them before fleeing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: East Bay Community Law Center:** This is where the meeting was held, not where Carolyn Wilson worked.
*   **B: Oakland polisi:** The police are *investigating* the situation, but Wilson didn't work with them prior to leaving.
*   **D: Dimba la Lockwood:** Lockwood Gardens is the housing complex affected, not Wilson's employer.



"
"Pamene kwatsala mipikisano inayi mundimeyi, ndi ndani amene ali pa nambala ya chinayi mu mpikisano woyendetsa magalimoto?","The correct answer is **D: A Bowyer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hamlin ali kumbuyo ndi ma points okwana 20, koma ali patsogolo pa Bowyer ndi ma points okwana 5."" This means Bowyer is directly behind Hamlin in the standings. Since Hamlin is in 3rd place, Bowyer must be in 4th place."
"Kutsatila mpikisano wakambidwa m'ndimeyi, a Kahne ali ndi mapointsiangati mu mpikisano woyendetsa magalimoto?","The correct answer is **A: Zikwi ziwiri mazana awiri ndi mphambu makumi awiri** (2,220).

The text states: ""Kahne ndi Truex, Jr. ali panambala 5 ndi 6 motsagana ndima point 2,220 komanso 2,207."" This directly tells us Kahne has 2,220 points.

The passage states: ""Of the 24,000 meteorites that have fallen to Earth, only 34 have been confirmed to be Martian."" This means people have witnessed and confirmed 34 Martian meteorites falling to Earth."
"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, choona chenicheni ndi chiti chokhudza miyala yomwe inapezeka kuti inachokera ku dziko la Mazi?","The correct answer is **D: Alipo makumi atatu ndi anayi mwaiwo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mwa ma meteorite okwana 24,000 omwe adagwera pa dziko lapansi, 34 okha ndi omwe adatsimikizidwa ndi ma martian."" This directly confirms that there are only 34 confirmed Martian meteorites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While meteor showers happened in July, the passage doesn’t say *all* the Martian meteorites were found *during* that time.
* **B:** The passage states there are 24,000 meteorites total, not 24 Martian meteorites.
* **C:** The passage states Martian meteorites are 10 times *more* expensive than gold, not $11,000 more.



"
Kodi a Schumacher anapuma liti ntchito?,"The correct answer is **A: Pambuyo pa kugwa kwa a Felipe Massa** (After Felipe Massa's accident).

Here's why:

The text states Schumacher *came out of retirement* to replace Felipe Massa after Massa was injured. This directly links Schumacher's return to work with Massa's accident. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kutsatila kupambana kwakwe kwa chisanu ndi chiwiri** (Following his 7th win) - The text states he retired *after* winning 7 championships, not that his return was related to that win.
* **C: Pambuyo polowa mmalo mwa a Felipe Mussa** (After replacing Felipe Massa) - This is a bit of a trick. He came *out of retirement* to replace Massa, so the act of replacing him isn't the reason he stopped retiring.
* **D: Pamapeto pa nyengo ya mchaka cha 2009** (At the end of the 2009 season) - The text says Massa didn't race for the rest of 2009, but doesn't say Schumacher's involvement ended then.



"
Kodi a Mussa anavulala liti?,"The correct answer is **A: Nthawi ya mpikisano wapamwamba wa Grand prix**.

The text states Massa was injured ""patachitika ngozi muchaka cha 2009 pa Hungarian Grand Prix"" which translates to ""in 2009 at the Hungarian Grand Prix"". A Grand Prix is a high-level competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Atapambana mu mpikisano wa formula 1** - The text says he was *injured*, not that he won.
*   **C: A Schumacher asanapume pa ntchito** - Schumacher's retirement is mentioned, but it's not related to *when* Massa was injured.
*   **D: Mpikisano wa nyengo ya mchaka cha 2009 usanayambe** - The text specifies the injury happened *during* the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009, not before the season started.

"M'mene zafotokozedwela m'ndimeyi, kodi dongosolo lidzakhudza bwanji AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Chiwelengelo cha anthu ogwiritsa ntchito AOL chizidzapikisana ndi cha anthu ogwiritsa ntchito Yahoo ndi Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the combined number of Yahoo and Microsoft users *could rival* the number of AOL customers. This means AOL will face increased competition and its user base will be challenged by the other two companies. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Chiwelengelo cha anthu ogwiritsa ntchito AOL chidzakwera** - The passage suggests the opposite, that AOL’s dominance might be threatened.
*   **B: AOL izakhala kampani yokhayo yotukuka m’misika ya IM** - The passage explicitly mentions Yahoo and Microsoft as competitors.
*   **D: AOL simazagwiritsidwanso ntchito ku dziko la Amelika** - The passage doesn’t indicate AOL will stop being used, only that its market position is vulnerable.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsatirazi zomwe pamapeto pake zikhoza kutha kutsatira dongosolo la tsopano?,"The correct answer is **C: Ufulu wotukula msika wa AOL panthawi yawo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states AOL's dominance is *threatened* because Yahoo and Microsoft combined could rival their customer base.** This directly implies AOL's ability to *continue developing* their market share (their ""freedom"" to do so) is at risk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kufalikila kwa chitukuko cha intaneti ku dziko la Amelika (The spread of internet development in America):** The passage doesn't discuss overall internet development, just the competition within the Instant Messaging (IM) market.
* **B: Kugwiritsa ntchito kwa msika wa IM (Usage of the IM market):** The passage discusses *competition* within the IM market, not the overall usage.
* **D: Mgwirizano wa Yahoo ndi Microsoft (The alliance of Yahoo and Microsoft):** While the alliance is the *cause* of the potential change, the question asks about the *outcome*. The outcome is the potential loss of AOL’s market dominance.



"
Ndi anthu angati amene anaphedwa muzachiwembu omwe sanali apolisi?,"The correct answer is **A: Khumi ndi asanu ndi ainayi (14)**.

Here's why:

The text states 19 people were injured, and of those, 2 were police officers.  Therefore, the number of civilians injured is 19 - 2 = 17. However, the question asks for the number *killed* who were not police. The text doesn't state anyone was *killed*, only injured.

The question is a bit tricky as it implies people died, but the text only mentions injuries. But within the context of available information, the closest answer that can be deduced is to work out the number of injured that were not police, which is 17. However, none of the multiple choices match. 

There seems to be a slight error in either the question or the provided text, because while the text states 19 injuries including 2 police, there are no fatalities mentioned. 

Assuming the question is asking about the number of non-police injured, then the closest answer from the options is **D: Makumi awiri**. However, this would be incorrect, as the actual number is 17.

Considering that the question says ""killed"" and the text mentions ""injured"", it's possible that the question should have asked ""injured"" instead of ""killed"". Then, the correct answer would be **D: Makumi awiri** due to rounding up the 17 injured.
"
Ndi ndani amene anapeleka lipoti la anthu oganizilidwa kuti anapanga chiwembu?,"The correct answer is **A: Polisi**.

The passage states: ""A polisi akuti akukaikila a Daesh (ISIL) omwe ndi agulu la uchifwamba pa chiwembuchi."" This directly translates to ""Police say they suspect Daesh (ISIL), a militant group, of the attack.""  Therefore, the police are the ones reporting their suspicion about who organized the attack.



"
"Chifukwa chakuziyeneleza kwa boma la Florida kokuti wopambana amatenga zonse, ndi mphoto yanji yomwe inapatsidwa kwa a Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Nthumwi zonse zaboma**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""As a state that awards all of its power to the frontrunner, Florida awarded all of its 50 delegates to Romney..."" This directly answers the question about the reward Mitt Romney received due to Florida's ""winner-take-all"" system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nthumwi makumi atatu ndi awiri:** This number is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Phwando lakusankhidwa kwa chipani cha Republican:** While winning delegates contributes to the nomination, the passage specifically describes the *immediate* reward - the delegates themselves.
*   **D: Maperesenti a ma voti makumi anayi ndi asanu ndi chimodzi:** This is the percentage of votes Romney received, not the reward he gained from the system.



"
"M’mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi maperesenti angati omwe a Gingrich anapeze m’masankho achipulula?","The correct answer is **B: Maperesenti makumi atatu ndi awiri**.

The passage explicitly states that Newt Gingrich received 32% of the votes.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi ndani amene sanapitilize zopikisana atamva zotsatira za gulu?","The correct answer is **B: A Bachmann**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A Bachmann omwe adapambana pa kafukufuku wa chisankho cha Ames Straw mu Ogasiti, aganiza zosiya kupanga kampeni."" This directly translates to ""A Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in August, considered dropping out of the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A Gingrich** - The text says Gingrich *conceded* to Santorum but criticized Romney, not that he dropped out.
*   **C: A Perry** - Perry stated he was going back to Texas to evaluate, but then said he would remain in the race.
*   **D: A Romney** - Romney was criticized by Gingrich, but there's no indication he considered leaving the race.



"
"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ndani amene anayankhula momuyeneleza mzake wina amene amapikisana naye kutsatila zotsatila za gulu?","The correct answer is **B: A Gingrich**.

Here's why:

The text states that after the results came in, Gingrich ""praised Santorum but criticized Romney, accusing his campaign of negative messaging targeting Gingrich in Iowa."" This is a direct instance of Gingrich speaking critically about a rival (Romney) following the caucus results.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A Bachmann:** She was *considering* dropping out, not criticizing anyone.
*   **C: A Romney:** The text says Gingrich criticized *Romney*, not the other way around.
*   **D: A Perry:** He talked about evaluating his path forward but didn't criticize another candidate.

Here's why:

The passage states the show was *initially* broadcast on TogiNet Radio before AstroNet Radio was launched as a supporting outlet.  The question specifically asks where it was shown *before* the end of 2015.  While the creators were *from* East Texas, that's where they were located, not where the show was broadcast. AstroNet Radio wasn't used until *after* TogiNet.



"
Siteshoni ikufotokoza za chionetsero kuti chinabweretsa mtundu wanji wa chisangalalo?,"The correct answer is **C: e Machitidwe achikale**.

Here's why:

The passage states the show features ""classic radio dramas, now the best around!"". ""Classic"" directly relates to things from the past, or ""achikale"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: woyamba kumene:** The passage doesn't mention the show being the *first* of its kind.
*   **B: Katswiri amene safunidwa:** This doesn't connect to anything in the text.
*   **D: Dela lanu:** This is unrelated to the show's content.



"
Kodi a David Headley adasokhanitsa chani chomwe mapeto ake chinathandizira kuti amenye asilikali owukira ochita zachiwembu ?,"The correct answer is **A: Uthenga** (Information).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kufufuza ndikusonkhanitsa mauthenga kwa David Headley zinathandizira zochitika za anthu 10 owopseza ndi amfuti..."" This directly translates to ""Investigations and gathering information from David Headley helped identify the 10 terrorists and gunmen..."" 

Therefore, David Headley provided **information** that led to the identification and apprehension of the attackers. The other options are things the attackers *used*, not what Headley *provided*.



"
Ndi njira iti yamayendedwe yomwe ankhondo anagwiritsa ntchito kupita ku Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngalawa** (Boat).

The text explicitly states: ""Anthu amene anachita za chipongwe ku Mumbai anafika pa **ngalawa** pa Novembara 26, 2008..."" (The people who carried out the Mumbai attacks arrived by **boat** on November 26, 2008...)."
Ndi mau ati akufotokoza m'ndimeyi molondola zotsatila za masewera a apabwalo apakati pa Nadal ndi Raonic Ku Brisbane?,"Correct answer: **C: Nadal anamuposa Raonic**

Here's why:

The passage states Nadal defeated Raonic in Brisbane. Although the exact score isn't given as a win/loss, it mentions Nadal won 76% of first serve points and won 88% of points overall, indicating a clear victory *over* Raonic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raonic anamuposa Nadal** - The text directly states Nadal won.
*   **B: Raonic anali ndi mapointsi okwanira makumi asanu ndi atatu mphambu zisanu ndi zitatu** - This is not information given in the text.
*   **D: Raonic anapeza mapointsi makumi asanu ndi awiri mpambu zisanu ndi chimodzi** - This is not information given in the text.



"
"M'mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, zinali bwanji pa masewera a Nadal ndi Roanic pamene mpira oyamba unamenyedwa?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal anapeza mapoint makumi asanu ndi awirimpambu zisanu ndi chimodzi**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Nadal adagoletsa zigoli zokwana 88% pamasewerowo ndikupambana ndima point 76 mchigawo choyamba."" This means Nadal won 76 point in the first set. With a 88% rate, this translates to approximately 56 points. Therefore, it is inferred that Nadal scored 56 points when the first ball was served.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage does not mention Raonic having 53 points.
*   **C:** The passage does not give us a score of 52 to 2.
*   **D:** The passage does not state that Raonic outperformed Nadal. In fact, it highlights Nadal's dominance (88% win rate)."
Ndi chiyankhulo chanji chimene sichinaikidwe mu ulutsi nyumba ya mawu ya atatu a tsopano amaliseche ?,"The correct answer is **A: Chi Italiyani**.

Here's why:

The text states that Global organisation is now broadcasting in English, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, and Korean. The question asks which of these languages is *not* in the ""third set of new languages"". 

*   English and Japanese were already broadcasting.
*   Spanish, Italian and Korean are the *new* languages being added.

Therefore, Italian is the one that's part of the new additions."
"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, ndikuti kumene nyumba youlutsila mau a Naked News sangapezeka?","The correct answer is **A: Foni yam'manja**.

Here's why:

The passage states Naked News will be providing news in the new languages ""pa kanema, tsamba la intaneti ndi **matelefoni am'manja**"" (on video, the website and mobile phones).  The question asks where the news *won't* be found. The other options (Internet, TV, video) are all explicitly mentioned as places where the news *will* be available.
"
Ndiopikisana angati amene sanamalize mpikisano wa chiphona cha Slalom?,"The correct answer is **A: Makumi atatu ndi asanu ndi chimodzi (36)**.

The text states: ""Mwa olimbana 116,36 adapeza zotsatira zofanana za “Simudamalize” mu mpikisanowo."" This means 36 competitors did not finish the Slalom race.



"
Ndi mau ati akufotokoza molondola zotsatila za Mpikisano,"The correct answer is **B: Osewera masewero apa ayisi okwana makumi anai ndi mphambu zisanu amene amapikisana pa masewero amene amathamanga pakati pa mapolo amene ayikidwa patali patali analephere kumaliza kuthamanga.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ""45 mwa 117 a Giant slalom adakanika mu mpikisanuwo"" which translates to ""45 out of 117 in the Giant Slalom did not finish the race"". 45 is equivalent to forty-five.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage mentions Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, but doesn't say she didn't finish. It just states Carpenado's time difference compared to her.
*   **C:** The passage doesn't compare the number of finishers between Slalom and Giant Slalom.
*   **D:** The passage states Carpenado finished 10th in *Giant Slalom*, not Slalom. In Slalom, she received a ""Simudamalize"" result (did not finish).



"
Ndiziti mwa izi zimene a NBA anapanga chiganizo choziimitsa?,"The correct answer is **A: Nyengo ya masewera ampira wa basiketi** (The basketball season).

The passage states the NBA *suspended its professional basketball season* due to COVID-19 concerns. This means the entire season was put on hold.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Wosewera wochokera ku dzikola Utah Jazz** (A player from the Utah Jazz) - While a Utah Jazz player triggered the decision, the decision itself wasn't about the player, but the broader risk.
*   **C: Osewera aliyense amane anapezeka ndi COVID-19** (Everyone who was found with COVID-19) - Only one player was initially identified.
*   **D: Timu ya mpira wa basiketi ya Utah Jazz** (The Utah Jazz basketball team) - The decision affected the entire league, not just one team.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, kodi chinabweretsa nkhawa ku NBA pa zokhudza kachilombo ndi chani?","The correct answer is **D: Osewera wa za Utah Jazz anapezeka ndi kachilombo** (Players of the Utah Jazz were found to have the virus).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ganizo la NBA lidabwera kamba ka osewera wa Utah Jazz yemwe adapezeka ndi ka chirombo ka COVID-19."" This translates to ""The NBA's decision came because of a Utah Jazz player who was found to have a case of COVID-19.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The passage doesn't say members of the sports organization were found with the virus, only a player.
*   **B:** It specifies *a* player, not multiple players.
*   **C:** The passage focuses on the health concern, not their performance."
Ndi ndani amene anagoletsa chogoli chowinila timu ya Washington Capitals mu masewera olimbana ndi Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **D: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""Kuthandiza koyamba kwa Ovechkin usikuwu kunali kwa chigoli chimene chinawapambanitsa masewera chomwe adachinya ndi watsopano a Nicklas Backstrom;"" This means Ovechkin assisted on the game-winning goal scored by Backstrom. While Backstrom *scored* the winning goal, Ovechkin *assisted* it. However, the question asks who scored the winning goal *for* Washington, and the passage specifically states Ovechkin scored his second goal of the night, becoming the first player to score 60+ goals in a season since Jagr and Lemieux.



"
Ndindani amene anagoletsa chigoli cha nambala makumi asanu ndi chimodzi cha nyengo munthawi yamasewera a Capitals ndi Thrasher?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""His second goal of the night was his 60th of the season, making him the first player to score 60 or more goals in a season since 1995-96, when Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux each accomplished the feat."" This directly answers the question, identifying Ovechkin as the one who scored his 60th goal.

"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, ndi dziko liti limene linakhudzidwa ndi kusainila mgwirizano wazakusintha kwa nyengo wotchedwa Kyoto","The correct answer is **A: Dziko la Amelika (The United States)**.

The text specifically states that ""Chiganizo cha a Rudd kusayina za nyengo a Kyoto Accord zikuchotsa America..."" which translates to ""Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto Accord removed America..."". This clearly indicates the United States was impacted by the signing of the Kyoto Accord, specifically by *removing* itself from the agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dziko la India (India)** - The text says India was *not* included in the emissions targets.
*   **C: Dziko la Ositileliya (Australia)** - Australia *opposed* ratifying Kyoto, but wasn't directly ""impacted"" by the signing in the same way the US was.
*   **D: Dziko la China (China)** - Like India, China was not included in the emissions targets mentioned in the text.



"
Boma lapitalo la dziko laOsitileliya limaganiza kuti kusintha kwa l ngwirizano wa kusintha kwa nyengo wotchedwa Kyoto ukhoza kudzetsa mavuto ku chani?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutumiza malasha kunja kwadziko**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the former Australian government opposed ratifying Kyoto ""saying it would damage the economy heavily reliant on exporting coal."" This directly links their concerns to coal exports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dziko la Amelika:** While the passage mentions the US withdrawing from Kyoto, the Australian government's concern wasn't *about* America, but about their own economy.
*   **B: Chuma chadziko:** This is too broad. The specific concern was the impact on a particular sector (coal exports).
*   **D: Mulingo wotulutsa mphweya wa dziko:** The passage does mention emissions levels in relation to China and India, but the Australian government's objection was specifically economic, not about their own emission targets.



"
Ndi pulogalamu iti yomwe owombera m'njira analembedwela?,"The correct answer is **D: Pulogalamu yakusaka ya Bungwe la masewera owombera la dziko laOsitileliya**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...pansi papulogalamu yosaka nyama yomwe adakhazikitsa a Sporting Shooters Association.""  ""Sporting Shooters Association"" is the same as ""Bungwe la masewera owombera la dziko la Ositileliya"" (Sporting Shooter Association of Australia).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pologalamu ya bungwe la masewera owombera la dziko la Ositileliya** - Too vague, it doesn't specify it's a *hunting* program.
* **B: pulogalamu yoteteza malo achilengedwe osungilako nyama zakutchire ndi cholowa** - This describes the overall goal of the park (KPWS & NPWS), not the program the shooters were enrolled in.
* **C: Progalamu ya NPWS** - NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service) *worked with* the Sporting Shooters Association, but the shooters were enrolled in *their* program, not NPWS'.



"
Ndi mau ati amene sakukamba molondola za kuyesera kuthana ndi tizilombo toononga?,"The correct answer is **A: Popeza inali pologalamu yoyeselera yoyamba, siyinaunikidwe.**

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""...kuyeseraku kudali koti kumayang'aniridwa bwino ndipo kudawunikidwa moyenera"" - meaning the trial *was* monitored and evaluated appropriately.
*   **Options B, C, and D** are all directly supported by information in the passage:
    *   **B:** ""anthu anayi osankhidwa kuti ayambe kuombela anaphunzitsidwa bwino"" (four people selected were well trained)
    *   **C:** ""tizilombo towononga adayang'aniridwa mosamala ndi alenje"" (pests were closely monitored by rangers)
    *   **D:** ""anthu owombera anayi anasankhidwa"" (four shooters were selected)

Therefore, only option A contradicts the information provided in the passage."
"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, kugawanika kunapezeka pati?","The correct answer is **D: Mudziko la Ethiopia**.

Here's why:

The passage states the expert is from the ""Rift Valley Research Service **ku Ethiopia**"" (in Ethiopia) and is discussing a split related to their research. While the split *happened* in the Rift Valley (A), the passage specifically locates the *researchers* and therefore the context of the discovery *in* Ethiopia. The other options are incorrect as they refer to *types* of evidence, not the *location* of the discovery.



"
"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chinachitika mwachangu mosephana ndi m’mene amayembekezela?","The correct answer is **B: Kugawanika (Separation/Splitting)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kutengera pa zomwe zapezeka zakalezi, zikutanthauza kuti **kulekanitsaku** kwafulumira kusiyana ndi m'mene zikuyembekezeredwa ndi umboni wa molecule."" 

This directly translates to: ""Based on the archaeological findings, it means that **the separation** was faster than expected by molecular evidence.""

The passage is talking about a splitting or separation event happening quickly, contrary to what molecular evidence suggests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupezeka kwa zinthu zakale (Discovery of archaeological finds):** While the discovery *led* to the realization, it's not *what* happened quickly.
*   **C: Kusanthula kwa umboni wa molecule (Analysis of molecular evidence):** The passage says the separation is *different from* the molecular evidence, not that the analysis was fast.
*   **D: Kafukufuku wa chigwa cha Rift (Rift Valley Research):**  This is where the research happened, but not what happened quickly.



"
Kodi osewera masewero amayenera kupanga chiyani kukwaniritsa mayendedwe ake nthawi ya masewero apa kompuyuta?,"The correct answer is **C: Masensa ayikidwe pafupi ndi kanema**.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller uses ""masensa awiri omwe adayikidwa pafupi ndi yakanema"" (two sensors positioned near the television) to detect movement in three dimensions. This is how players control actions in the game by moving the controller in the air.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kuonetsetsa kuti sensa yowongolera yaikidwa pafupi ndi pachiwongolero** - The sensors need to be near the *TV*, not the controller itself.
*   **B: Aikidwe pa malo amakona atatu** - While the system uses a triangle for detection, the controller doesn't need to *be* a triangle or positioned in a triangular shape.
*   **D: Kuyendetsa chiwongolero kudzera mlengalenga** - This is *how* they control it, but not *what* they need to ensure for it to work - the sensors must be able to see the TV.



"
Ndichinthu chiti chimene chinapangidwa poyelekeza remote yakanema?,"The correct answer is **A: Ma sensa awiri achiwongolero**.

The passage specifically states the controller ""amagwiritsa ntchito masensa awiri omwe adayikidwa pafupi ndi yakanema"" (uses two sensors placed near the TV). This is what the controller design was based on, likened to a remote control.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kusintha kwa chiongolero cha Nintendo** (Nintendo's shift) - This is too broad; the passage discusses a specific *part* of the new console, not the overall shift.
*   **C: Kufotokoza mfundo** (Explaining a point) - This isn't related to the controller's design.
*   **D: Kusitha kwa chiwongolero chaNintendo** (End of Nintendo's controller) - The passage is introducing a *new* controller, not ending one.



"
Ndiziti zomwe sizinakambidwe mu lipoti laposachedwapa la nyumba yofalitsa nkhani ya Xpnhua?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndege inatela mu Ürümqi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial reports claiming the plane turned back to Afghanistan were *denied*, and that it instead landed in Ürümqi. This means the landing in Ürümqi was a correction to a previously stated (and incorrect) fact.  The other options *were* mentioned in the Xinhua report or subsequent reports:

*   **A: Ndege inalandila chiopsyezo cha bomba** - The report stated the plane was potentially threatened by a bomb.
*   **C: Ndege inapatutsidwa ku Afuganisitani** - The initial reports claimed it was diverted to Afghanistan.
*   **D: Ndege inatela ku Kandahar** - The initial reports specifically stated it was heading to Kandahar.



"
Ndiziti zomwe sizinakambidwe mu lipoti loyambilira la nyumba yofalitsa nkhani ya Xpnhua?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndege inalandila chiopsyezo cha bomba**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the initial report from Xinhua said the plane was diverted. *Later* reports said it was threatened with a bomb and returned to Afghanistan. The initial report **did not** mention the bomb threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndege inalandidwa mwaupandu** - The passage clearly states Xinhua reported the plane was diverted.
* **B: Ndege inakanizidwa chilolezo kuti itele mwadzidzi** - The passage states the plane was initially said to have turned back to Afghanistan but was later denied permission to land in Ürümqi.
* **C: Ndege inapatutsidwa kubwelelanso ku Afuganisitani** - The passage states the plane *did* return to Afghanistan (Kandahar).

Ndindani amene analephela kumufikila?,"The correct answer is **D: A Bob Dylan**.

The text states Sara Danius was *unable to reach* Bob Dylan, meaning he was the one being difficult to contact. The passage highlights her attempts to contact *him*. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Omwe amagwira nawo ntchito chifupi a Bob Dylan** - The passage doesn't mention anyone working for Bob Dylan being the problem.
* **B: A Sara Danius** -  She is the one *trying* to reach someone, not the one being unreachable.
* **C: Academy ya ku Sweden** - The Academy is the organization Sara Danius represents, not the individual being contacted.



"
"""Ndi ndani amene anayikila ndemanga pokhala lonjezo la"""" gawo lalikulu""""""","The correct answer is **C: A Gordon Johndroe**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mneneri wa a Bush a Gordon Johndroe analonjeza North Korea…"". This means Gordon Johndroe made the statement promising a ""gawo lalikulu"" (important and reliable way).



"

The text states: ""Anapanga ma sitampa okwanira 1,000 a dziko la Sweden komanso maiko ena 28."" This means he created stamps for 28 other countries *in addition* to Sweden, totaling 1,000 stamps for all countries combined. This equates to roughly one thousand stamps for all the countries.

"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, ndi chani chomwe chili ndi kuthekera kudzetsa kupitiiza kutaikila kwa mpweya kuchokera m'mathanki ?","The correct answer is **C: Kudzadzana kwa mpweya otentha** (The accumulation of hot gases).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kutsegula kwama valve kumalora kuti kudzadzana kwa mpweya mu makina kutuluke..."" (Opening the valves allowed the accumulation of gases in the system to escape...).  This directly links the valve opening to relieving a buildup of gas, which would otherwise continue to build pressure and potentially lead to further leaks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pamalo otetezeka achiwiri anadzadza kupyola mulingo wake** (The secondary containment area filled beyond its capacity) - The passage mentions a secondary containment area, but doesn't say it *caused* pressure buildup.
*   **B: Monga mwachizolowezi njira yoyeselera yozimitsira moto** (As a routine fire suppression test) - While a fire suppression test initiated the events, it wasn't the *cause* of the ongoing pressure/leakage.
*   **D: Moto udakolera pa malo ogulitsila mafuta otchedwa Fort Greely** (Fire occurred at the fuel station called Fort Greely) - The passage mentions a leak *near* Fort Greely, but a fire didn't cause the pressure buildup within the tanks.



"
Ndi chifukwa chani ma vavu othandizira anatseguka?,"The correct answer is **A: Panali Kudzadzana kwa mpweya wotentha mkati mwa mathanki**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kutsegula kwama valve kumalora kuti kudzadzana kwa mpweya mu makina kutuluke..."" This directly links the opening of the valves to the release of pressure buildup inside the tanks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While there was a power outage, the text states this *caused* the valves to open to relieve pressure, not that it was the reason *why* they opened.
*   **C:** The text mentions another tank was *not* full, so this isn't a general reason for the valve opening.
*   **D:** The passage does not mention any safety measures not being able to hold enough liquids.

"Panopa, mulingo wamadzi ndiwokwera bwanji ku wodi ya chisanu ndi chinayi?","The correct answer is **C: Kukwera kulekeza mchiuno**.

The text states: ""Ward yachisanu ndi chinayi, ... pakadali pano ili m'madzi ofikira m'chiuno..."" which translates to ""Ward five and four... is currently in water reaching waist-deep.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makumi awiri kuzama pansi** - The text mentions 20 feet during Katrina, not the current water level.
*   **B: Main’nchesi asanu ndi chimodzi** - This refers to the amount of rain that could *cause* damage, not the current water level.
*   **D: zana limodzi kuzama pansi** - The text mentions a 100-foot area where water could overflow, not the current depth.

Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe sizidatsimikizidwe ndi a Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **D: Kapezedwe mthupi katsopano ka wodwala** (Whether a new strain of the virus was identified).

Here's why:

*   **P** states that Hamilton is claiming the hospital *failed* to properly treat the patient *but* the patient recovered. It also states the patient traveled to Nigeria (where Ebola was present) and the hospital followed proper protocols.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

*   **A: Kumene odwalayo anapita** (Where the patient went) - The passage explicitly states the patient went to Nigeria.
*   **B: Kuthekera kokuti odwala ena atha kutenga kachirombo** (The possibility that other patients could contract the disease) - This is implied by the hospital's isolation procedures – they were trying to prevent spread to others.
*   **C: Kaya ndondomeko yoyenera inatsatiridwa** (Whether proper protocols were followed) - The passage directly states the hospital followed proper protocols.

The passage doesn't mention anything about a new strain of the virus being identified. Hamilton's claim is about the *treatment* and *prevention* of spread, not the virus's characteristics.

Therefore, **D** is the only option not confirmed by the information in passage **P**."
Ndi chani chimene a katswiri a sayansi akufuna kunmetsetsa?,"The correct answer is **D: Dziko lapansi linapangidwa bwanji**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Asayansi akuyembekeza kuti amvetsetse m'mene mapulaneti amapangidwira, komaso kwambiri kwake momwe Dziko lapansi linapangidwira..."" This directly translates to ""Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, but especially how Earth was formed..."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pamene nyenyezi inaombana ndi dziko lapansi** - The passage mentions comets hitting Earth, not stars.
*   **B: M’mene ma mapulotini amapangidwila** - While comets brought materials that *could* contribute to protein formation, the main focus of the scientists is planet formation.
*   **C: Zithu zopangidwa ndi zithu zachilengedwe ndi chani** - This is too broad; the passage is about the origins of Earth specifically.

The passage states ""apolisi 80 ndiwomwe anathandizira anthu komwe nseu udalunjika."" This means the police were directing traffic to alternative routes because the highway was blocked.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Analimbikitsa a FBI kuti atseke:** The passage says the Maryland Transportation Authority closed the bridge *at the recommendation of the FBI*, not that police recommended it.
*   **B: Anapanga chisankho chotseka:** The passage states the Transportation Authority made the decision to close the bridge.
*   **D: Anapeleka malopoti okuchedwa kwa magalimoto oyenda mbali ina ya mseu:** The passage states there were *no significant delays* reported, so they wouldn't be reporting delays.



"
Chinachitika ndi chani ku njira ya pansi yolowera nthawi yotseka?,"The correct answer is **A: Anatchingidwa**.

Here's why:

The text states the Maryland Transportation Authority *closed the bridge* based on an FBI tip, and a garbage truck *blocked the entrance* to the road. This clearly indicates the road was **blocked/closed**, not used as a route, free for drivers, or congested.

"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, sichinachitike ndi chani katswiri ojambula zithunzi asanagundidwe ndi galimoto?","The correct answer is **A: Ojambula zithunzi analamulidwa ndi apolisi a munsewu kuti abwerere kupita tsidya lina la msewu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Malingana ndi apolisi, woyendetsa galimoto yomwe inagunda wojambula ndi zokayikitsa ngati ayimbidwe mulandu."" and before that it states ""...apolisi apamseu, aku Califonia. Zomwe zidapangitsa apolisi kumuuza asiye ndikupita tsidya lino kawiri."" This clearly indicates the photographer was told to move before being hit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B:** While the photographer *did* park on Sepulveda Boulevard, this happened *before* being told to move.
*   **C:** The photographer *tried* to take pictures of the police, but this doesn't describe what happened *immediately* before the accident.
*   **D:** The passage mentions Bieber, but there's no indication the photographer successfully took a picture of him."
kodi ojambula zithunzi ankayesera kuchita chani asanagundidwe ndi galimoto?,"The correct answer is **B: kujambula zithunzi za malo a polisi oimitsa pamsewu**.

The text states: ""wojambula anaimitsa galimoto yake kuima tsidya lina la Sepulveda Boulevard ndipo adayesa kujambula zithunzi za wa polisi asadawoloke nseu kupitiliza..."" This directly translates to the photographer trying to take pictures of the police officers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** While he *did* park his car, that wasn't what he was trying to *do* before being hit.
*   **C:** The text doesn't say he was trying to cross a busy road.
*   **D:** He wasn't explicitly trying to get the police to let him continue, just taking pictures of them.

Ndi mawu ati amene sakufotoza molondola za mmene mtsogoleri wadziko ankapezela mthupi atapezeka di kachilombo?,"The correct answer is **A: Sankamva bwino**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states he is feeling *well* despite the virus, apart from a fever and sore throat. Saying he ""doesn't feel well"" contradicts the information given. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ali ndi zilonda zapakhosi** - The passage confirms he *has* a sore throat.
*   **C: Akupeza bwinoko** - The passage states he *is* recovering well.
*   **D: Iye watentha mthupi** - The passage confirms he *has* a fever.

"Monga fotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi mau ati mwa otsatilawa amene akufotokoza zolondola za mtsogoleri wa dziko?","The correct answer is **C: Akhoza kugwilira ntchito malo ena osati ku ofesi**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states he is ""kugwira ntchito yanga pogwiritsa ntchito makina a intanet"" (able to do his work using the internet). This means he can work remotely, not in the office.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Iye sanatenthe mthupi** - The passage explicitly states he has a fever (""kutentha kwa thupi"").
*   **B: Akhala kwa masabata angapo ali kunyumba** - The passage states he will be in isolation (""m'malo aokha kaye"") but doesn't mention the duration being weeks. He expects to return to work on Monday.
*   **D: Anali ndi ululu waukulu wa kachirombo** - While he has a virus, the passage says it is ""kosadetsa nkhawa"" (not worrying) and describes his symptoms as mild (""kutentha kwa thupi komanso zilonda za pakhosi""). ""Ululu waukulu"" (severe pain) is not indicated.

"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, Kodi mvula yamkuntho yotchedwa Gonu inayembekezeledwa kuti ipitiliza kufooka liti?","The correct answer is **B: Pamene mphepo inatsika kuwomba kufikila makilomita makumi asanu ndi atatu pa ola**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Momwe kumacha nkuti mphepo yili pafupifupi makumi asanu ndi atatu ndi mphamvu zitatu ndipo *tinayembekeza kuti zichepe*.""  This directly indicates the expectation of weakening *when* the wind speed reached around 53 kilometers per hour (and category 3 strength).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isanafike ku Maldives:** The passage doesn't mention expectations of weakening *before* reaching the Maldives.
*   **C: Isanafike pachimake:** The passage doesn't discuss a peak or maximum intensity.
*   **D: Isanakumane ndi mphepo zowomba mtunda wa zana limodzi makumi anayi mphambu zisanu ndi zinayi pa ola:** This wind speed isn't mentioned in the passage as a point where weakening was expected."
Kodi mphepo zinkaomba mwachangu bwanji pamene mvula yamkuntho yotchedwa Gonu inafika pampondachimera?,"The correct answer is **C: Mailosi 149 pa ola**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""idafika pa mphepo yowomba makilomita 240 pa ola limodzi (mamayilosi 149 pa ola)."" This directly translates to 149 miles per hour.
* **Option A is incorrect:** It states kilometers, but the question asks for miles per hour.
* **Option B is incorrect:** It states 240 miles per hour, which is the speed in kilometers, not miles.
* **Option D is incorrect:** It states a much lower speed than the one given in the passage.



"
Ndi ziti mwaizi zomwe sizikutengedwa ngati khalidwe la Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: ndiyokhala ndimokhala zamoyo mwambiri** (it is a multicellular organism).

Here's why:

*   The passage states that *Karenia brevis* are **unicellular** organisms (""zinthu zamoyo zomwe zimakhala ndi cell imodzi"").  ""Mwambiri"" means multicellular.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Ndi mtundu wa ndere** (It is a type of algae) - The passage explicitly says they are algae (""ndere"").
*   **B: zikhoza kuleketsa kugwira ntchito mitsempha ya anthu** (can interfere with nerve function in humans) - The passage states they release neurotoxins that damage human nerve cells.
*   **D: Zimachitika mwachilengedwe** (Occurs naturally) - The passage states they occur naturally (""Zachilengedwezi"").



"
Ndi ziti mwaizi zomwe a Karena brevis sanathe kupanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuononga madzi** (Destroying water).

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** Karenia brevis *lives in* the water and its toxins *contaminate* the water, causing harm. It doesn't say it destroys the water itself. It's still water, just with harmful toxins in it.
*   **The passage clearly states:**
    *   A: Karenia brevis produces neurotoxins that damage the nervous systems of fish.
    *   B: The passage says blooms occur when conditions are favorable, implying rapid growth.
    *   D: Karenia brevis releases neurotoxins, which are poisons.

Therefore, the one thing the passage doesn't attribute to Karenia brevis is *destroying the water*."
"Monga zanenedwa m'ndimeyi, ndi ziti mwazotsarazi zomwe sizinachitike chifukwa cha mphepo ya nkuntho yotchedwa Felicia?","The correct answer is **A: Phindu la mvula**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that the rainfall of 6.34 inches on Oahu was described as ""beneficial"". This means the rainfall itself was a positive outcome, *not* a destructive event caused *by* the hurricane. The other options (B, C, and D) are all described as effects or characteristics *of* the hurricane and its remnants.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mvula yobwera ndi mabingu** - The passage states, ""Mvula ina idali ndi mabingu komaso ziphaliwali pafupipafupi."" (Some of the rain included hail and frequent lightning). This *was* a characteristic of the storm.
*   **C: Mphezi yobwerezabwereza** - The passage mentions frequent lightning as a characteristic of the rain.
*   **D: Kusefukira kwa madzi mumsewu** - The passage states ""kulibe zomwe zawonongeka kapena madzi wosefukira"", suggesting no flooding occurred, however it is a consequence hurricanes can cause."

Ndi mawu ati amene akufotokoza molondola za zotsatila za mpikisano wa chaka cha 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: A Kenako Piquet Jr. anachotsedwa ntchito**.

The passage states: ""A Piquet Jr. ntchito yawo idathetsedwa pamene mpikisano wa 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix utatha."" (Piquet Jr.'s job was terminated after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A Fernando Alonso anachita ngozi:** The passage mentions Alonso being *passed* due to the safety car, not having an accident.
*   **B: A Piquet Jr. adapeza chipambano:** The passage doesn't state Piquet Jr. won anything.
*   **D: Galimoto yotetezera magalimoto ochita mpikisanoinachita ngozi:** The passage mentions a safety car being deployed *because* of Piquet Jr.'s crash, not that the safety car itself crashed.



"
Kodi ngozi inachitika liti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndi nthawi yomweyo yomwe Alonso anyima kanthawi kochepa**.

Here's why:

The text states ""Piquet Jr. anachita ngozi muchaka cha 2008 ku Singapore Grand Prix atangoyima koyambilira pa piti Fenando Alonso..."" which directly translates to ""Piquet Jr. caused an accident in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix right after braking behind Fernando Alonso."" This means the accident happened simultaneously with Alonso's braking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pamene magalimoto ena amathila mafuta** - While pitting for fuel was a *result* of the safety car being deployed, it wasn't when the accident *happened*.
*   **C: Galimoto yoteteza magalimoto ochita mpikisano isanabwere** - The safety car came *out* because of the accident, it didn't precede it.
*   **D: PamenePique atapita kukaonjezera mafuta** - Piquet wasn't pitting for fuel when the accident occurred; he caused it while behind Alonso.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndiziti mwa izi zinatenga nthawi yochepa kutengela ndi m’mene panthawiyo azakafukufuku amakhulupilira?","The correct answer is **C: Kuswana pakati pa zinthu zamoyozosiyana** (Hybridization between different species).

Here's why:

The passage states that the research shows ""mitundu yina ya zamoyo yapezeka mu mibado yiwiri"" (some species were found in hybrid forms). This means that *hybridization* (crossing between species) happened. The passage then says this takes a ""long time"", but implies that it happened more recently than the divergence of the Darwin's finch, cactus finch, and *Geospiza conirostris*. Therefore, hybridization is the process that the research suggests took less time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupanga zinthu zamoyo zoti zichuluke** (Creating life to diversify) - The passage doesn't talk about the *creation* of species, but their *divergence* and mixing.
*   **B: Kulongosola za zithu zamoyo zoti zimachulukana** (Describing living things to reproduce) - Reproduction is implied, but isn't the focus of the timeframe discussed.
*   **D: Kusinthika kwa zinthu za moyo** (Evolution of living things) - While hybridization *is* a part of evolution, the passage specifically focuses on the timescale of the hybridization event itself, not evolution in general.



"
Ndi ziti mwazotsarazi zomwe sizinalengezedwe ndi azakafukufuku?,"The correct answer is **C: Dzina la zinthu za moyo zatsopano**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the *origins* of existing finch species, not the discovery of entirely new species.** It talks about how current species evolved *from* others.  It doesn't mention naming new lifeforms.
* **A: Kumene zinthu zamoyo zimapangidwira** - The passage mentions the Galapagos Islands as the location where these birds are found, implying where they evolved.
* **B: Kutalika kwa ndondomeko ya kasithidwe ka zinthu za moyo** - The passage explicitly states the process takes a ""long time"" - establishing a timeframe for evolution.
* **D: Mbalame zimene zikukhudzidwa ndi kuswana** - The passage identifies specific finch species involved (Darwin's finch, *Geospiza forte*, cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*).

Therefore, the one thing *not* reported in the passage is the naming of new lifeforms."
Kodi perete wa ng'ombe wazionetsero za luso akachitikila kuti?,"The correct answer is **B: M’mzindawa Bucharest**.

The passage specifically states that Bucharest is the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the CowParade. The question asks *where* the exhibition will take place, and the text directly answers that it will be in Bucharest.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mumizinda ingapo ya Romaniya:** The passage only mentions Bucharest.
* **C: konse kum'mwera chakum'mawa kwa Europe Ulaya:** While Bucharest is *in* Southeastern Europe, the exhibition isn't happening *throughout* the region.
* **D: Mumizinda ingapo ya likulu ya Europe:** Bucharest is a capital city, but the passage doesn’t state the event is happening in multiple capital cities.

Chinadzetsa dziko la Rasha kuletsa kugwiritsa ntchito 11-76s ndi chani?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngozi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Russia idayimitsa mwachidule Il-76s chifukwa changoziyo."" (Russia temporarily grounded Il-76s because of the accident.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asilikali amkati:** The passage mentions the plane is operated by military personnel, but doesn't say internal conflicts caused the grounding.
*   **C: Asilikali ankhondo amaiko ena aku Rasha:** The passage doesn’t mention other countries’ militaries.
*   **D: Kuyembekezera kufufuza:** While an investigation *was* launched, the grounding was a direct result of the accident, not just waiting for the investigation's findings.



"
II-76 ndi chani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndege**.

The text states: ""Ndege imeneyi idapititsidwa ku Irkutsk..."" and later refers to ""Il-76"" as something that had an engine failure while *taking off*. This clearly indicates it is an airplane.

The text states: ""...adathandiza kupanga nawo The Simpsons pamodzi Brooks ndi Groening , ndipo dali ndi udindo olemba ntchito anthu oyambilira olemba masewero."" This directly translates to ""...he helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and was one of the first people to write for it.""

Therefore, Simon was part of the original writing team.



"
"Malingana ndi a Fluke, ndi ndani amene ankamutumizila ndemanga zabwino ndizomulimbikitsa?","The correct answer is **D: Anthu onse amuna ndi akazi** (Both men and women).

The passage states that Fluke came to her conclusion because of ""a group of mothers and fathers who supported and encouraged her to make medication access a priority in health work."" This clearly indicates support came from *both* men and women.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madotolo** (Doctors) - The passage doesn't mention doctors specifically.
* **B: Omenyela maufulu wa zaumoyo wa amayi** (Mothers' health rights advocates) - While likely part of the group, the passage specifies *mothers and fathers*, making this too narrow.
* **C: Amuna** (Men) - This is only half of the group mentioned in the passage.



"
"Malingana ndi m’mene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, ndi zithu ziti zimene anthu ena sankafuna kuti amayi aziyankhulapo?","The correct answer is **C: Zaumoyo wa a mayi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that attempts to prevent mothers from freely discussing their health are failing. This directly indicates that others didn't want mothers talking about their health (""zaumoyo wa a mayi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Athu amuna** - The passage doesn't say men specifically were trying to silence mothers.
*   **B: Ndalama zolipila ku chipatala** - The passage doesn't mention anything about hospital fees.
*   **D: A Fluke** - The passage is *about* Fluke, not what others didn't want her to talk about.

The text explicitly states: ""Malingana ndi momwe tikudziwira, pali planet imodzi yokha imene inawonetsa mphamvu kuposa Titan, ndipo dzina lake ndi Dziko.” (According to what we know, there is only one planet that has shown more power than Titan, and its name is Earth).



"
Mitsinje ndi nyanja zopezeka ndi madzi amandalazi zinapezeka ku planet/dziko lanji lamlengalenga?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Idzachita makhalidwe ngati amadzi. ... Ngati mwayima m'mbali mwa gombe, mukhoza kuwona miyala yosalala ing'onoing'ono imene kapena zinthu zafungo zokhala ngati madzi zimene zili ku malo otsika."" and then mentions Stofan saying Titan is the only planet known to exhibit power comparable to Earth. This strongly implies the discussion is about liquid features (like rivers and seas) found on Titan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jupiter:** Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface with rivers or seas.
*   **C: Sun:** The Sun is a star, made of plasma, and doesn't have liquid water.
*   **D: Saturn:** Saturn is also a gas giant, though it has rings of ice and rock, it does not have liquid water features like rivers and seas on its surface.



"
Ndi ziti mwazofufuzazi zomwe sizinali zotsatila zakupezeka kwa nthenga?,"The correct answer is **A: Ntundu wa nthenga za nyama** (The color of animal feathers).

Here's why:

*   The passage states the researchers determined the color of the feathers (coffee/red outside, brilliant/grey-red inside) through detailed analysis *beyond* what the fossils directly showed. This means the color wasn’t directly observable from the fossil itself – it was inferred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kumvetsetsa kuti nthenga sizimagwiritsidwa ntchito kuuluka** (Understanding that feathers weren't used for flight): The passage directly discusses the finding that the feathers were likely for display or thermoregulation, *not* flight, based on the structure of the feathers. This is a conclusion drawn *from* the evidence.
*   **C: Kuzindikila kusintha kwa nthenga** (Recognizing feather changes): The passage mentions the rachis changing over time, which is an observation based on the fossils.
*   **D: Kutsimikiza kuti nyama zambiri za dinosour zinali ndi nthenga** (Confirming that many dinosaur animals had feathers): The passage starts by saying the research *confirmed* the existing idea that some dinosaurs had feathers – this is a direct finding.



"
Ndi chani chomwe nthenga za nyama ya dinosour zinalibe?,"The correct answer is **A: Thanmbi yaing'ono yomera pansi panthenga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Chifukwa nthenga za dinosaur zilibe shaft zokula bwino, zotchedwa rachis..."" which translates to ""Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis..."" 

A ""thanmbi yaing'ono yomera pansi panthenga"" directly refers to this rachis, the central shaft of a feather. The other options are not mentioned as missing features in the text."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage states ZMapp showed *less* benefit than hoped for, not more.
* **B:** While the passage mentions comparing three treatments, it doesn't say the other treatments were specifically ""curing"" drugs.
* **D:** The passage states ZMapp didn't show enough benefit to prevent death, so it didn't demonstrate strong curative power.

Here's why:

* The text states the device is made using ""ma inkjet osindikizika apamwamba"" (high-resolution printable inkjets) to create ""kachipang'ono kosindikizidwaka"" (a small printed device/chip).  The key is that the *chips themselves* are created through a printing process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Senti imodzi ya U.S. pa chilichonse** (One U.S. cent each) - This is the *cost* of the chip, not the method of making it.
* **B: chosindikizira ink chamuligo wapakatikati** (a mid-range ink printer) - This describes the *equipment used*, not the final product.
* **D: Zida zina zodziwira matenda** (Other diagnostic tools) - The passage is specifically about *this new* device, not other tools in general.

*   **A: Ndemanga zowonjezera:** Mndimeyi siyotulukira kuti ndemanga zowonjezera zichikhale china chopindulitsa.
*   **C: Kukambirana kwa umboni wamboni zoona ndi maso:** Mndimeyi idakuwona ngakhale umboni wachinyengo kwa omwe anawona ndi maso.
*   **D: zofalitsa zolemba m'magazini:** Zofalitsa zithunzi ndizomwe zakhala zikudandaula."
"Malingana ndi mmene zafotokozeledwa m'ndimeyi, Ndi chani chomwe sivuto latsopano pogwira ntchito ma sila?","The correct answer is **A: Nyengo yoipa kwambiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...*komaso nyengo yoyipa kwambiri zakhala zikulepheretsa kuthekera kopulumutsa.*"" (and also very bad weather has been hindering rescue efforts). This directly identifies the bad weather as a factor making rescue work difficult.

The passage discusses the *amount* and *size* of the dry islands (ayisi = islands), but these are presented as the *problem* being worsened by the bad weather, not as a new problem in itself. They are described as being at a level not seen in 15 years, but the weather is actively hindering rescue.
"
"Kuonjezera ayisii, ndichaninso china chimene chikulepheletsa ntchito zopulumutsa?","The correct answer is **B: Zanyengo (Weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**nyengo yoyipa kwambiri zakhala zikulepheretsa kuthekera kopulumutsa**"" which translates to ""bad weather has been hindering rescue efforts.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kusowekera kwa zipangizo zoyenera (Lack of equipment):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of equipment.
*   **C: Kusowa chithandizo (Lack of support):** The passage doesn't mention a lack of support.
*   **D: Omata (Floods):** While the passage discusses floods (""madzi ouma""), the floods *are* the problem, not something hindering rescue *in addition* to the floods. The weather is causing the floods and hindering rescue.



"
Roberts adakanitsitsa kutsindikiza zamfundo yachikhulupiliro chiti?,"The correct answer is **C: Chiyambi cha moyo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Roberts ""adakanitsitsa kukambapo za nthawi imene amakhulupirira kuti moyo umayamba"" (refused to discuss when he believes life begins). He avoided taking a specific stance on the definition of when life starts, which is the core of the philosophical debate around abortion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Makhalidwe abwino okambilana milandu (Proper conduct regarding cases):** While Roberts did discuss how judges should approach cases, the passage focuses on *what* he avoided discussing.
*   **B: Kuthekera kokhazikika kwa zigamulo za bwalo lamilandu la pamwamba la supulimu khoti (The stability of Supreme Court precedent):** He affirmed the importance of precedent, but that's a consequence of avoiding the core belief question, not the belief itself he refused to state.
*   **D: Ufulu wa chinsinsi (Right to privacy):** He affirmed his belief in the right to privacy as established by Roe v. Wade, but he didn't refuse to discuss it – he stated his position.



"
Ndi mutu uti umene a Roberts amaona ngati ndioipanda pa umunthu kukambilana?,"Yoyenera kwambiri ndi **A: Kusasinthika kwa zigamulo za bwalo lamilandu la pamwamba la supulimu khoti.**

Tiyeni tiwone chifukwa:

* **P:** Roberts adati funso la nthawi imene moyo umayamba siliyenera kuyankhapo mwapadera, koma adabweleza kuti Roe v. Wade ndi ""lamulo lokhazikika mdzikomo"" ndikutsindika kufunika kwa zigamulo zosasinthasintha za Bwalo Lalikulu la Apilo. 
* Izi zikusonyeza kuti a Roberts akuyembekezera kuti malamulo akhazikika ndipo sakufuna kuti apitirire kukambirana zinthu zomwe zingasinthe malamulo amomwe zinthu zikuyendekera.

**Zifukwa zomwe mayi zitha kusankhidwa:**

* **B:** Chigamulo cha mulandu wapakati pa a Roe ndi a Wade - Ngakhale a Roberts adatchula Roe v. Wade, zomwe akuyembekezera sikuti akambirane chigamulocho, koma kuti chikhale chokhazikika.
* **C:** Ufulu wachinsinsi wosonyenzeka - A Roberts adatsimikizira kupereka ufulu wachinsinsi, koma sikuti ichi ndicho mutu womwe adati siliyenera kukambirana.
* **D:** Zenizeni za milandu - Izi sizikuwonekera m'mawu omwe adapereka.



"
Kodi magetsi awiri owala kwambiri akuchekera kuti?,"The correct answer is **C: pa chandamale kapena pogendelapo pa ndege yoyamba**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the lights were put up ""to illuminate the sky all night"" and commemorates the time the first plane crashed. This strongly suggests they are pointed upwards, specifically towards where the plane went down.
*   Option A is too vague.
*   Option B is incorrect as the lights are specifically for remembering the plane crash, not just generally illuminating the city.
*   Option D is incorrect because the memorial park is *between* the buildings being constructed, not the location of the lights.



"
"Malingana ndindimeyi, ndi malo ati amene akumangidwa nyumba zosanjana?","The correct answer is **D: Kumanga kukupitilira**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ntchito yomanga manyumba asanu ataliatali kwambiri ikupitilirabe pamalopo..."" which translates to ""The construction of five houses is continuing nearby...""

The question asks *where* the houses are being built, and the text directly states they are being built ""pamalopo"" - nearby, and the construction is ""ikupitilirabe"" - continuing.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pakati pa tsiku** (Midday) - The text doesn't specify *when* the construction is happening, just that it's *continuing*.
*   **B: nthawi ya 8:46koloko m'mawa** (8:46 am) - This is the time of the memorial, not where the construction is.
*   **C: Mkati mwa usiku** (In the night) - While lights are mentioned being on at night, it doesn’t say construction is happening then.



"
Ndi mawu ati amene akusonyezakuti atsikana apachibale asanu ndi awiri ndi aku mphanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kusiyana matenthedwe (Temperature differences)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zithunzi zapa fulemu zimawonetsa kusiyana kwa nyengo kuyambira usiku ndi masana zimawonetsa kuti mwina ndi maphanga."" and ""...panthawi yamasana ndiwozizira kwambiri kuposa pamwamba pamalo ozunguliridwa ndiponso usiku ndiwofundirako.""  This directly links the temperature variations to the possibility of them being caves/caverns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mzere wapakati wanjira zolowera ku mphanga (Center line of cave entrances)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about entrance lines.
* **C: Kafukufuku wa zanthaka (Geological research)** - While Glen Cushing is a geologist, the passage focuses on *evidence* found (temperature differences) that suggests they are caves, not just the act of research itself.
* **D: Zithunzi za mphanga za dziko la pansi (Cave images of the earth)** - The images show temperature variations, not just cave images. The images are used *to suggest* they are caves.



"
Kodi chikhalidwe chamatenthedwe a mphanga zotchedwa alongo asanu ndi awiri chikuwunikidwa bwanji?,"The correct answer is **D: Kafukufuku wa mphanga za dziko lapansi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically discusses how the temperature of ""The Seven Sisters"" (the ridges) is being studied by comparing it to temperatures of other ridges on Earth.** Glen Cushing's quote directly refers to comparing their thermal properties to ""large ridges on Earth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Choyezera kutentha kwa chithu kapena chida (Measuring the temperature of an object or tool)** - While temperature *is* involved, the passage isn't about the method of measurement itself, but about *comparing* temperatures.
* **B: Maenje akuya munthaka (Seeds sprouting in the ground)** - This is completely irrelevant to the passage.
* **C: Mzere wapakati pa Mphanga (Ridge Midline)** - The passage doesn't focus on the physical midline of the ridges, but their thermal characteristics.

"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi mawu ati okhudzana ndi wokaikilidwa omwe sioona?","Yoyenera ndi **C: Kumene amachokera kapena kobadwira kwake kunandziwika ndi adindo**.

* **D** ndi chiyembekezo cha munthuyo, osati zomwe adindo akudziwa.



"
Ndi mawu ati okhudzana ndi chiwembu omwe adindo anatsikimiza?,"The correct answer is **B: Kochokera kapena kobadwira kwa oganizilidwayu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the detective ""knows he is from the Uighur ethnicity."" This directly relates to the origin/where the suspect comes from.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kudziwika kwa anthu ena onse amene anathandizila chiwembucho** - The passage doesn't mention anything about other helpers.
*   **C: Cholinga cha chiwembucho** - The passage doesn't state *why* the bombing happened.
*   **D: Dzina loyamba ndi labambo ake awoganizilidwa** - The detective doesn't know the suspect's name.



"
Ndi timu iti idzasewere masewera ake ku Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa ndi Ositileliya** (South Africa and Australia).

The passage states: ""Masewera akumapeto amgululi adzakhala ku Ellis Park ku Johannesburg mulungu wamawa, pamene ma Springbok azasewera ndi Australia."" 

""Ma Springbok"" is the nickname for the South African rugby team. Therefore, South Africa and Australia will play at Ellis Park.



"
Kodi ndi kuti komwe a timu ya Springboks adzasewera masewera awo otsatila?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The passage states: ""Masewera akumapeto amgululi adzakhala ku Ellis Park ku Johannesburg mulungu wamawa, pamene ma Springbok azasewera ndi Australia."" This directly answers the question of where the Springboks will play their next game."
Ndi ziti mwazotsatilazi zomwe a malo okwelera chombo mlengalenga analindi mavuto pa nthawi ya ntchito?,"The correct answer is **A: Kusunga mtunda woyenera kuchokera kuma thrusters** (Maintaining a safe distance from the thrusters).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Chiao ndi Sharipov adaoneka kuti adali mtunda wautali bwino kuchokera ku zochitika zosintha zama attitude thruster."" (Chiao and Sharipov appeared to be a good distance from the attitude thruster firing events).  This directly indicates a concern about being too close to the thrusters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kusunga chida cha gyroscope** (Maintaining the gyroscope) - The passage mentions the gyroscope *working* throughout the journey, not that it was a problem to maintain.
* **C: Kuyambitsa kuuluka kwa ndege** (Initiating aircraft flight) - The passage discusses events *during* a space mission, not the initial launch.
* **D: Kubwerera mchimake** (Returning to Earth) - While the passage mentions a good appearance of stations, it doesn't specifically mention the return trip as being problematic.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, cholinga cha malo opangidwa m'mlengalenga komwe azayayansi amakumanako ndi chani?","The correct answer is **B: Kuyandikila zosithila ma thrusters**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""Chiao ndi Sharipov adaoneka kuti adali mtunda wautali bwino kuchokera ku zochitika zosintha zama attitude thruster."" This translates to ""Chiao and Sharipov appeared to be a good distance from the attitude thruster adjustment events."" This implies the space station is a location where adjustments to thrusters are made.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kupeza gyroscope otayika** - The passage mentions gyroscopes being used during a journey, but doesn't suggest the station's purpose is to *find* lost ones.
*   **C: Kumaliza danga loyendamo** - The passage doesn't mention completing a journey.
*   **D: Kuyambitsa kuuluka kwa ndegem** - The passage only refers to the station and thruster adjustments, not launching aircraft.



"
Ndi mawu ati otsatilawa omwe sioona okhudza mlandu?,"Yoyenera yankho ndi **A: Umazengedwela mu boma limene muli likulu la AOL**.

Zifukwa:

*   **P:** Izi zikunena kuti mlandu udachitika ku Virginia, komwe AOL idachokera. Koma mlanduwo wokhuzana ndi AOL kukhalapo sikuganiza kuti mlanduwo unachitika m'boma limene AOL ili. Mlanduwo ukhoza kuchitika kulikonse ngakhale AOL ili ku Virginia.

"Malingana ndi 'ndimeyi, ndi kalabu yanji yomwe a Vidal anayamba kusewerako kwa nyengo zitatu zapitazo?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The text states: ""Vidal wazaka 28 , adalowa Barca nyengo zitatu zapitazo **kuchoka ku Sevilla**."" (Vidal, 28 years old, joined Barca three seasons ago **from Sevilla**.)

This directly indicates that Vidal played for Sevilla before joining Barcelona.



"
Ndi masewera angati amene a Vidal asewelera ku kalabu ya Barça,"The correct answer is **A: Makumi anayi ndi chisanu ndi anayi** (49).

The text states: ""Vidal adasewera masewero 49 mukalabu yake."" which translates to ""Vidal played 49 games for his club.""
"
Ndi timu iti yomwe inali yotsutsa m'masewerawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states Jarque was preparing to play against the team ""Bolonia"" on Saturday. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jarque:** Jarque is the player, not the opposing team.
* **C: Coverciano:** Coverciano is the location of the training center.
* **D: Italy:** Italy is the country where Coverciano is located.



"
Ndichifukwa chani Jarque amakhala ku nyumba yogona alendo?,"The correct answer is **C: Anali ndi masewera lamulungu** (He had a game on Sunday).

Here's why:

The passage states Jarque is at Coverciano, staying in the guest house *because* he's preparing for a game against Bologna on **Saturday**. This implies the reason he's there early is to prepare for a match that will take place the following day - Sunday.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amakhala ndi nthawi yoyeselela masewela** (He has time to try out games) - The passage doesn't mention testing games, but *preparing* for a specific game.
*   **B: Amakhala ndi nkumano nthawi ya nyengo yake isanafike** (He has a meeting before the season begins) - The passage refers to a specific game against Bologna, not a general pre-season meeting.
*   **D: Amapanga masewera oyeselera ndi Bolonia** (He is holding practice games with Bologna) - He is preparing *to play* Bologna, not holding practice games *with* them.



"
Ndi chifukwa chiyani bungwe lazanyengo la geophysics sanapeleka chenjezo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sikumafikila kufunikila kwakukulu kwa mulingo wa zivomelezi**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""palibe chenjezo la tsunami limene lidzapelekedwe chifukwa chivomerezi sichinafike mulingo woyenelera wa 6.5."" This directly translates to ""no tsunami warning was issued because the magnitude did not reach the necessary level of 6.5.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Panalibe chiopsezo cha madzi osefukila otchedwa Tsunami** - While true *after* the assessment, this isn't *why* the warning wasn't initially issued. The assessment determined there was no danger.
* **B: Kuwopetsa mantha pakati pa anthu okhala m’mdera** - The geophysics bureau isn't trying to cause fear, they are making a scientific assessment.
* **C: Kuwopetsa kuonongetsa malonda am'mderalo** - Again, this isn't the reason for the decision. They don't avoid warnings to protect businesses.



"
"Malingana ndi ndimeyi, ndi chani chimene chinachitika kaamba ka chivomelezi?","The correct answer is **A: Anthu a am'deralo amantha kwambiri** (People in the area became very scared).

Here's why:

* The passage states that even though there was no tsunami warning (because the earthquake wasn't strong enough), ""anthu okhala kumaloko anayamba mantha ndikuyamba kusiya malonda ndi zinyumba zawo"" - meaning people in the area became scared and started leaving their belongings and homes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Chiopsezo cha madzi osefukila otchedwa Tsunami** (The threat of tsunami waters) - While there *was* a potential threat, the passage specifically says a warning *wasn't* issued.
* **C: Chenjezo linapelekedwa** (A warning was issued) - The passage clearly states NO warning was issued.
* **D: Mlingo wa 6.5** (Magnitude of 6.5) - This is the threshold for a warning, but the passage doesn't say the earthquake *reached* this magnitude, only that it didn't.



"
Ndi ziti mwa izi zomwe zimalimbikitsa ntchito za dzuwa ndi nyenyezi zina zonse?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuwunika ndi mayendedwe antundu wamagazi otchedwa plasma**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly states:** ""Adapeza kuti Dzuwa limayenda mofanana ndi nyenyezi zina: zochitika za nyenyezi zina zimadalira **kuwunika kwawo, kuzungulira kwawo**, osati china chilichonse.""  This means light and the movement of plasma are fundamental to how stars, including the sun, function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nambala ya nyenyezi, kuzungulira ndi kusintha kwa maginito:** While the passage mentions these, it says the Rossby number (related to rotation and magnetic fields) impacts *stability*, not the fundamental workings.
* **C: Kuzungulira ndi kuunika:** While correct as part of the answer, it misses the vital component of plasma movement.
* **D: Kuunika, nambala ya nyenyezi ndi kuzungulira:** The Rossby number is related to magnetic fields and stability, not core functionality.



"
Kodi nambala ya nyenyezi za rossby zimadziwika bwanji?,"The correct answer is **A: Kuunika ndi kuzungulira** (Brightness and rotation).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kuwonekera ndi kuzungulira ndi zomwe zimagwilitsidwa ntchito kuti adziwe nambala ya nyenyezi yomwe ndi yogwilizana ndikuyenda kwa plasma.""  This directly translates to ""Brightness and rotation are used to determine the stellar Rossby number.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mulingo wa kuyenda kwa magazi a plasma** (Level of plasma flow): While plasma flow is *related* to the Rossby number, it's not how it's *determined*.
* **C: Mulingo wa ntchito kapena zichitochito** (Level of activity):  Activity is a *result* of the Rossby number, not a way to measure it.
* **D: Mulingo wa kusintha kwa maginito** (Level of magnetic change): The passage states that a *decreasing* Rossby number affects magnetic changes, but doesn't say magnetic change is how you *find* the Rossby number.
